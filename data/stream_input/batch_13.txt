B003LMGDHI|5|Great stuff! Works great for buffing from the color sand. Also awesome for headlights!
B011J6KXR8|5|It works very well!
B00JGP8I1S|5|Works great, the best of all the others that I tried
B0049W2XFK|5|Looks good and seems solid easy install
B001JT02IQ|4|Would have been better if it included a flylead to connect from the device to the unit.
B004PV1YHS|4|Delivered on time , good recommended product
B00KXE3Q3Q|4|Gift
B0002SRCMO|5|Works great on my autos, the rubber is a must to protect your paint.
B005CWA8RG|5|Did the job...jam up ......delivery<br />Was fast will order more
B003CXOHRY|1|I saw this wheel kit for my Yamaha EF2400ishc generator. It looked different from a 'lower priced' wheel set than I have seen in the past.<br />Once it arrived it was nothing more than 4 x small 'screw on' wheels and NOT the nice handle with 2 large wheels that are in the photo.<br />I was charged $104.71 and the seller sent me the $97.44 set.<br />Beware
B00LN3QI1I|5|Super bright. Perfect for my bike!
B004I18G1M|5|the lense was on my doorstep on the second day after I ordered it !! % minutes to replace the old with the new, and state inspection is good for another year. Excellent price and exact fit....Life is Good! Thanks for everything
B000C6ZRDW|5|Make sure you order left and right model numbers. Works great on 95 wrangler 2.5L notice difference in stopping power. Everything you need for swap.
B006N9IGJ4|5|Worked great perfect fit
B007MYPAC0|4|I've come to prefer the hangers that come with two hooks and hook onto one post. They just seem friendlier to use. I was really excited to be able to use the space behind the driver's chair more fully. When you bump it, one side tends to come off the post.
B000CB0JVM|5|Excellent fit; great price, same as the Toyota branded old belts.
B007RYOPNK|5|Ordered this for a 2013 328iand it fits perfectly.  Seems to be made to handle wear and tear and last a long time.
B006LO8PMO|5|good battery
B00282ETBY|5|EXCELLENT
B0041TVUO6|5|Perfect fit.. just like OEM
B00OOJFWU6|5|I love how the bloodshot eyes poke out from the rims on my car.  The give the impression that I have run over some irrelevant clod and his eyes are being squished out of his head from the weight of the tire rolling over his head.  Think of one of those Squeeze-O toys in which the eyes, ears and brains are forced out of the skull of the toy when you squeeze it in your hand.  Plus, they keep dust and s*** out of your valve stems.  Over all excellent addition to any vehicle.
B0002SA244|5|Fit well and slides well. Not quite OEM, but overall very good.
B003E417WY|5|Installed very easy.  The only thing is the engine light continually comes on and has to be deleted, wish I could find out what I have to do to fix this
B00IKMBZM2|5|Wiring diagram could have been better, had to cut the black and white wire to the fan to remove the old unit, after that the new unit was very easy to install.
B000A0GZ6S|5|Nice cover, as described, fit nicely.
B00GG9FB8U|5|Great car wash. With the two bucket method I can easily do two cars from one gallon of water.
B00Y5HM5KM|2|The replacement horn was too large and I had to adapt the mount to fit.  The horn wasn't as loud as hoped after installation.  The mount alteration resulted in a lower volume blast from the horn.  Not what I expected.
B00ITUAPZ8|5|Worked as advertised. What more could you ask?
B004BTF0QU|5|Great and great price
B00GEW6II6|5|cool sticker! thanks
B00877TP4K|5|A great fix for an all too common problem with the cheep crap that was original equipment.  I did have to ream out both holes to allow the roll pin to fit properly but I consider that a non-issue.  They should last longer than the rest of the window parts.
B00RVUH30M|5|Excellent!!
B00A89JH1G|5|High quaity stainless steel with a nice finshed
B00PQZMB10|1|I have a 350z and just did not look good at all, too much excess material near head rest - looks very cheap.  The seat always has wrinkles, does not form fit very well... sloppy fit.
B001BBV8DA|5|Bought these lights they come with bright low beams they look really nice!!
B000NKCM2Q|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B001G6JRVA|5|No more oil leaks. Quality product. My car smells better too!
B004GC0J4U|5|Fits in my 2006 325xi perfectly!
B0000AY2HN|5|Good price. I have used this in a saltwater environment for years. The best!
B00CPBW6LS|5|I got this cat decal for my mother, who loves cats, and it looks exactly as it does in the picture. She thought it was the funniest thing ever, and she's gotten a lot of compliments on it. She got a few bubbles under the decal, but that's pretty common, and isn't really the product's fault. Also, the package came with extra decals. I think there were two pink mustache stickers that were about the size of a finger, which was an unexpected but welcome surprise. All and all, we were both very happy with the order. It is definitely worth it for the crazy cat lady in your life... :)
B00192JGY4|5|Just finished a 7200 mike trip.  I have an LP generator which I used to power my 5th wheel when stopping at truck stops rather than RV parks.  This little gem kept me informed about when I needed to get more LP.
B00P9R1TH2|1|Different threads than my cans.  This is for the newer type cans, not the old style I was hunting.  These are useless to me.
B00BPSUDGW|1|I bought this for the easy to use trigger and quick disconnect adaptor. During my initial charging procedure, I noticed the gauge would read zero when I squeeze the trigger which tells me that there is no freon coming out of the can. So I reintroduced the can but still nothing. I tried a different can and still nothing. So I decided to exchange the hose kit for a new one. After getting home, connecting everything together to the car, the gauge on the new one still reads zero when the trigger is squeezed. I'm not sure if it's the needle not puncturing the can or something but I just could not get the freon out. So I opted for a refund and bought something else.
B004GCD2W6|4|Thank you very much
B004BT6N8Y|5|A great wiper blade that doesn't leave streaks.
B00Q6EHPNY|2|wrong size
B0066QV72M|4|I have been super happy with this product snapped right in and no problems whatsoever. Easy to install and took no time at all to complete. Very happy customer here.
B000JFHNQA|5|Purchased this charger on recommendation by our mechanic. It's easy to use and charges a 1972 Mustang, 1982 Porsche and 1998 Ford Explorer (all of which are rarely driven). No move moving cars around and pushing them out of the garage to jump start!
B0050LU2GQ|4|This is such a great concept -- if it worked.  The problem is that the hook that's included is too small and couldn't fit over the rear view mirror anchor.  As a result, it's totally useless.  Maybe a good idea would be to measure the mirror anchor before purchasing.  Had to return.
B0036E9VB6|4|Actually ended up buying another one of these.  While it does a good job, the build quality of the car plug is not well thought out.  It uses a different screw setup and spring mechanism for the fuse.  In short, if it breaks, you can't fix it easily (believe me when I say I tried!).  So just be careful how you store it.
B009WDF98Y|5|Good fit. Just like OEM
B000C5GAUM|5|worked fine
B0049PPB8S|5|Very good price. Shipping was fast. Revision c. Noticeable increase in power.
B00ODCYGVU|5|The product was exactly what was advertised and received quickly. Great job
B00JRE1QIK|5|They fit and look great
B008RHCH0Y|4|I think these have been ok. However, I do not know what you are supposed to attach to them, because they said for Vstar, but maybe they meant stock turn signals. I got some aftermarket ones and they did not even come close. I would also like to add if you do go the fork route you will have to drill a hole at an angle for the wiring for a cleaner look. Otherwise you smash them and they do not work or short out. I had to modify these a lot to ge them where I needed them. For me, it was not a cookie cutter process. But what about custom is? They function, they look better now that they are plastidipped, and are METAL.(Not heavy duty, but not horribly thin) I bout some fork clamps from another company and they were plastic, which are TRASH! I would buy them again for less than 15 bucks. Not too shabby.
B00HUGND6K|5|Fun!  Well made...
B00DBEOM56|1|Terrible already quit working
B0026JK8FK|5|Works great, I use it in my rsx type s and in my civic si, helps with the 6 speed tranny issues.
B01092IEEM|2|The front seats look great, but the back seat could not be used on a 2015 Jeep Compass
B00LBOK8JW|5|Excellent
B00HS5TL2I|4|The large emblems are a little larger than OEM ones. Would be nice if they included the small emblem on the tail. Overall quality of material is very good and I'm expecting it to last a while.
B00CEXKAK6|5|works great!
B00V4KIUOS|2|some stiching bad 1st time worn
B00CIB25CU|5|Very nice decal. I got it earlier then expected. I place on the back of my car and it look very sicks. I cant be happier. Too all OP fans it very nice.
B010PEN2BE|5|Purchased just for the cover to replace the cover on my existing fixture... which would have gotten 5 stars for quality and fitment.  This kit also includes the LED bulb, which was an unexpected bonus.
B0049R6ANQ|5|Perfect fit, glad i bought it.
B000Q0K5SQ|5|So, it really did tighten up that lower shaft.  In my case, I still have a ton of noise (rattle) from the upper shaft.  Easy to install if you can put your head where your feet belong in the truck.
B00NGJOQHA|5|Fits Subaru BRZ remote perfectly
B00HQQQZ0K|5|Makes my G look beast when I turn it on. So far none of the lights have flickered or gone out in the past 5 months since purchase. They are also extremely to install for someone with little knowledge on car modifications I did it in about 15 minutes.
B001C63ZVC|5|Great fit and took care of my problems
B00K007R6U|5|Wonderful for non smokers kills all odors
B00QHA8Y3W|3|Alot more complicated than said in ad, also wiring diagram not included, but was sent in email down load.
B000EQB4BE|4|Good wires for a great price. Be sure to check each one with a multi-meter when they arrive for low resistance. First set i bought had one bad wire, which makes doing the whole job pointless. Had to wait till replacements arrived as seller could not just send the one wire i needed but it all worked out eventually
B0002JM69W|1|Piece-o-shit. Embarrassing how poor the quality !!!
B000GRML72|5|It is what I wanted and works great.  Small sleek looking, blocks wind and bugs.
B00SCHXFP0|5|Have just got this amazing wet suit! Didn't even expect this is sooo great! I'm size XS and it's very hard to find something that small to fit me. And this one is just like custome made for me:) very good quality and sexy design) I'm very happy with this order)
B0039Z3T0Q|3|Work good .material feels like it won't last long
B009X1X3V0|5|Excellent product! Was exactly what we were looking for!!
B00HPBC1TA|3|This is a good state has a good invasive on it The only downside that I have seen so far is it does fade in the sun but that is to be expected some But my wife loves it
B002RKD3UA|4|what I expected.
B00FPL1D2I|1|Manufactured cheap leaks
B000GTYZJW|5|Excelent
B009DJSOIY|5|Working as expected 6 months later
B00AQMB96G|5|After the shipping issue was taken care of everything is fine. They work great.
B00063XX5U|4|I have not had a chance to use this yet. I was doing the CV boots on my car and did not have this tool. A friend had a home-made version of this and his worked very well, and can imagine this tool will do the same. This is a must for installing band style clamps. People told me you can tighten those clamps with a pair of pliers, good luck, spend the $20 and get this tool, save yourself the headache.
B0041FXOIA|5|this step makes it so easy too get in the back bed of my Dodge 2500 ( if you buy one you wont regret it )
B005RE79RQ|5|Bought these for my '94 civic ex. A friend helped me install them with my old springs and they made a world of difference. Good buy.
B00EKMXIFI|4|Worked as described. Arrived quickly.
B001KOG0TK|2|cheaper just to buy a new master cylinder
B00HFHDDVO|5|Its just what I was expecting. Very good product
B001LHVOVK|1|got a &#34;link error&#34; on both my ford and Chrysler cars.  Even tried the &#34;turn on the key&#34; suggestion by some others.  I contacted Amazon who gave me my money back and didn't have to return the item.  Amazon - good.  Autel - bad.
B00U2C3B4I|5|Great fit. Not popping off.
B00C30H9UE|5|It fits perfectly in my car!  Very nice quality as well. Extremely satisfied! Well worth the price!
B00ZV0KU5O|5|It was more than I expected is really nice I recommend this product forever  everyone
B00FH8P1DG|4|Wish it had a wiring harness other than that it's bad ass
B005ASY23I|5|nice, well built.
B000C93EHK|4|Walker muffler installs easily and is priced well below a new Honda replacement. My 2004 Civic EX with 123,000 miles sounds like new again! Unfortunately one of the metal rod hangers was not spaced properly resulting in contact with the underside of the car so I had to remove the muffler again to bend the hanger over. I doubt the rod was bent in shipment as the box showed no signs of damage. I suggest to buyers of this muffler to measure the spacing of the rods compared to the OEM Honda unit before install. If not for the inconvenience of having to &#34;fix&#34; a new muffler I would have rated at 5 stars.
B00S0F2F4G|5|Authentic remote for a great price compared to that of the car dealerships. Very satisfied customer!
B0031XMM9A|5|Just as described, fit perfectly
B000NS71H4|5|Item arrived and was as described. In addition, it came a few days earlier than anticipated.

B00EO0583Q|1|couple of the LED lights didn't work.  The first bar light I received the top row did not work.  Got it exchanged and reintsall.  The new bar light works for a few months then one by one the LED light starts dieing out.  This light is NOT meant for outdoor use.
B00JGQLZJ4|5|Cheaper then shop great
B00H8DFKS4|5|Bulbs are nice and bright and working great.<br />Puddle pair weren't the right type.
B00W41KPU8|5|Nice
B00A1A4I1Q|4|Bought for cold mornings on the motorcycle.  Does the job, but the vents could be better- when stopped in cold weather, your breath fogs up your glasses as much of it escapes out the top instead of the designed vent holes.  Otherwise keeps your face, neck and ears warm while riding.  Can't complain too much for the price I paid.
B000BYEOIY|5|Fast delivery, easy installation. Right fit for my car, which by the way it came back to life with these plugs! I feel it has more power and much better response when pushing the gas pedal, and runs smoother. Great product!
B000C9QLQQ|1|This product says it will fit my 04 unpalatable but it's the steering lock not the dash lock be an sure u check which one u need
B0002MAHKE|4|I like them.  They seem to be brighter then most other non LED bulbs.
B000W1XX4M|5|Check engine light is now gone. Fast shipping.

B004D0EAUE|5|Fit perfectly and starts my diesel with no problem. No core return required.
B005OVM1KC|5|Worked great
B0073MFGPW|5|perfection
B000BQSIWK|5|Great product and price. I have used it on both my truck and quad with great success. The charge took me about 2-3 hours for me to get what I was looking for which is awesome. I only wish the cord was a little bit longer...other than that, exactly what I needed
B00ZLPABGC|5|I love it.  It works great.  Easy to install and really is a great safety product especially when driving a large SUV.  Thank you.
B00W2DO0EU|2|Not the smoothest print quality, a bit streaked.  Text and graphics are smaller than I'd anticipated
B00498MU8O|5|Great
B0007LMBOK|5|Cannot believe the uses I have found for this(cleaning bath tub, tile, etc.) Keeps me from having to bend and stoop.

B00L9NB2F4|5|Great
B000FOL0AA|3|Doesn't stay put, unless you use tools to tighten it.
B0026CH6FC|5|Happy with the product! Easy to install, predrilled to come aligned with the holes under my hood. Shipping time was excellent.
B0065X7Y9G|5|Ok
B00HMFI6SO|5|Love it..looks better when on the bumper.
B00P53UOUS|5|Beautiful and easier to install then I expected!
B005EN7BDM|5|Well made, great price and fit just right..<br />Thank You CFR
B0018L2LR0|4|Delivered on time. I purchased it for my wife and she's so happy with it
B00BUSOKBQ|4|Works great.  Easy enough to install.  No problems yet, but I wish the light was brighter.
B00D6N0WV0|1|The fuel sending unit did not work upon installation.  I could not return it because the 30 day return policy had elapsed.  Shame on me for assuming it would work properly and taking 29 days before I installed it.
B013XSCHXI|4|I bought this for my father in law that is big into guns and the second amendment. Very nice glossy sticker that he can proudly display anywhere of his choosing. This is nice and thick and he is going to love it. Very satisfied thanks!<br /><br />Disclaimer** I received this at no cost in exchange for my honest and unbiased review
B004LX14Z2|5|A great charger that actually recognizes the battery it is attached to and selects the right setting. I have noticed better battery performance from its &#34;Repair&#34; setting. I am very pleased with the purchase!
B00CCK9R1Y|2|PSA: If you are looking for quality aftermarket parts, Moog is generally a pretty good choice, but the RK is not.<br /><br />The compliance bushings on the lower control arm for my 2001 Honda Civic needed replacing for years, so about 5 years ago I replaced them with some cheap no-name Chinese ones from fleabay. Those lasted about 3 years before one of them tore. When I was looking for replacements, I was pleasantly surprised that these moog brand ones were very price competitive to the off brands and ordered a pair. Installation was straight forward, and they fit fine.<br /><br />Less than a year later, a bushing on both of the arms was already torn. I chalked that up to possibly a rough winter? After all, it's Moog and they're suppose to be some of the best aftermarket quality products you can buy right? I reordered another pair and installed them.<br /><br />Months ago I started getting vibration in my steering wheel again, and some clunking noises over bumps. I disregarded the control arms, because they were less than a year old. Well I checked again today, and the bushings are worn looking.<br /><br />I went on the internet and found out that the Moog &#34;RK&#34; is a budget line with lower quality products that may not even be made by Moog or it's parent company Federal Mogul. The &#34;K&#34; line with the yellow and blue boxes that has their &#34;problem solver&#34; parts is the quality stuff. These just came in a white box with a Moog label on them.<br /><br />One horror story I found online had someone with Moog RK lower control arms who had a catastrophic failure and ended up in a ditch right off a highway.<br /><br />I have noticed the place I purchased them from (AAP), no longer sells these control arms. Stay away from the RK line! The original control arm and the replacement each didn't even last a year! I'll be nice and give them 2 stars because if you're just planning on selling the car and want something that bolts up, then these are fine and will work, but if you're keeping the car longer than a year you're going to need to replace them again.<br /><br />P.S. When installing lower control arms, also make sure to tighten them on the ground, rather than in the air. They need to be loaded when tightened to be positioned properly.
B001KQD7XA|5|This is a great product. It worked so well I ordered three more for the other windows.
B0016KABFC|5|Great product
B007D5L194|5|I love these lights, they fit perfectly and looks great. I would strongly recommend them.
B00KQHTBRK|1|This LED light bar worked fine for about a week and then a quarter of the LEDs failed. Now it looks terrible. Waste of money; do not purchase.
B001U04N34|2|Blew the fuse the moment I plugged in my tablet and it blows fuses constantly.  It's a cheep inverter, I got what I paid for.
B003C3SNA6|5|Just what my diesel needed!
B00A8MZ7EY|5|Very great product!
B008NG6M5U|3|Everything fine, nice stckers
B000IY667E|3|China but works fine
B00B2YE4B4|5|So far they seem to work great as long as they last I'll be very happy, give a good bright light inside the truck.
B00LFL7AWY|1|this does not fit on lancer 2004
B00E5OUOCQ|1|Much to small for a Prius
B0030GF2NQ|5|Arrived as expected
B009NZWT5M|5|I purchased these a while ago and they have been perfect still working!!!! And so much for the $100 bulbs from autozone lmao smh I can't believe people pay that much
B00RKXSHS2|5|Works great!!
B00IRYVK5A|5|yep it had no scratches
B00JRHL0II|5|surpassed all my expectations, what I thought was an issue with the trailer brakes turned out to be an activator issue
B002VF8284|5|good quality. ok
B002DZJQ0A|5|Fast and very reliable!
B002QOYS42|5|Very happy with my order. It arrived on time and in perfect condition.<br /><br />Thank you
B00L19QE9A|5|This is one of the best items that I've ever purchased.  We installed it in our 2005 truck.  Makes backing up ever so much easier.<br />Actually don't know how we ever did without it.
B00AXLNTJK|2|These covers slide every time you get out
B00JLJV1ZO|5|Works perfectly,  fit great and great price and quick shipping
B00GBSCROC|5|I use this tool roll-up to hold miscellaneous items and gear in my get-home bag.  I do not carry much, so there remains usable space within the roll-up for other items as they move into and out of my kit.  Note: This roll-up is small, relatively speaking.
B0048J4Q6I|5|surprisingly cheap price.  perfect exact fit!  easy to install. all hardware for installation included.  functioned perfectly.  will definitely buy again as needed!
B0146K3MYA|5|Finding a quality Anti theft device can be trying especially when they become so expensive luckily I came across this. The price seemed too good to be true but I was beginning to get desperate so I gave it a try and it works so good! It is easy to attach and unattach and I can just slide it under my seat when I am driving so no hassle there. It is a total must have for anyone with a vehicle.
B0002JMEJ4|4|Less $ than Auto-Zone brand. Would be nice if the bottle had a translucent strip with the &#34;ounces&#34; marked. Other than that, good product.
B0024NSLMA|5|Easily installed(20 min.) and I can see again.
B001G7O4U8|4|Not exact fitting, but usable.
B000AUMTZY|5|They for 95-99 maxima
B00J5BETSE|5|These are great and at $12 with Prime, you can't beat it. They are plenty bright in the daytime.<br /><br />The only issue I have is, if you tighten it down too much it will pull the bolt out. This is mostly due to me mounting it through the solid rubber mount that is stock on my bike. If it was mounted between metal it shouldn't be a problem. Now if you dropped the bike, the stalk will likely fall off. It would be easy to pop back on though after dismounting the entire signal. They are mounted on a dual sport so I will see what they do in a crash soon enough.<br /><br />A big plus is that they bend. So on a minor drop they should just bend out of the way. So see this a a con, but for me this is a great feature.
B00VVFO39W|5|It's extremely easy to install and works reliably. I installed it with a dryer power cord to an existing 240/30amp outlet. Once I tested it and confirmed working, I drilled a hole with a 3/4&#34; spade bit and used a liquid tight conduit fitting to make everything waterproof. The screws securing the door uses a security bit that looks like a star bit with a hole in the center so try not to lose it. However, you can easily find a replacement at a hardware store. Fuse for the charger is rated 40 amp and can be purchased from specialty hardware stores like Grainger for around $10 each. I always get a spare in case it blows (which it shouldn't... It's a 30 amp breaker but I like to be prepared...) and I ziptied it to the inside of the case.<br /><br />There's a pigtail included with the charger that you can use to set the amp draw. If you have a full 40 amp outlet, you don't have to install it. I have a 30 amp outlet so with the pigtail set, it will draw 24 amp max. This is a great safety feature. Without it, the charger will draw 30 amp which may trip my breaker and is very close to max specification for my outlet and the line, leaving no wiggle room.<br /><br />I'm eligible for $250 rebate from my power company, so that should drop the price of this charger to around $150. With the charging timer on my Leaf, this ensures that I will always be charging during the lowest tiered hours (11PM to 7AM) where 1kWh is only around 1 cent. I can charge the battery from empty to full in around 5.5 hours.
B00M9MSI6A|5|These are a fantastic product and totally changed the look of my bike. I would also like to say what a great company Custom Dynamics is. I had an install issue, contacted Kim and she took care of the matter in a most professional way. I would highly recommend this company and its products.
B00FH433DK|1|scratched my face up
B000FW7VFK|5|Good deal I use on custom motorcycles will not damage paint and lasts longer due to the fact it does not draw moisture like conventional brake fluid. arrived on time
B000CAW7VS|5|Work great on Toyota '04 Corolla.  Make sure to buy a pair of bolts with 8mm x 1.25 thread pitch.  Using those in the small threaded holes on your old drums to help get them off without a hassle.
B001FAI9Y8|5|Great
B00UXYFOMW|5|Unusual sound but easy install on my '11 Tacoma.  Fast secure shipping at a substantial savings. The only caveat is the hose could have been longer to allow more flexibility in placement.  But short hoses do make for more efficient activation.  Be sure to mount the compressor perfectly vertical to extend life and expect to change the relay within a few years.  What a great set of pipes!
B006YDHHY4|5|little louder, deeper, mean, tone. but its not obnoxious. much lighter too :D This was soo easy to install. I usually break something anytime I do mechanical work, I'm so bad, but I did this by myself in 1 hour. lines up great. My car : 13' Audi TT 2.0 AWD (s line trim)  UPDATE: 1/3/16  I got used to it and was not loud enough, So I cut out the muffler section and welded on a straight piece of tube to fit. Now it sounds perfect. Still dont notice it when cruising, but when you get on the gas it sounds so deep, very nice. So get a straight pipe if you can thats my suggestion. I am used to running cars with no cat and straight pipe that are ridiculously loud.
B00GI2CBIS|5|Super cute & helps keep the heat out of car in Louisiana heat
B0002LBKGA|2|I've been using Klasse for about 10 years based on the recommendation of a car upholsterer.<br /><br />However, when I opened this bottle I was surprised the liquid was milky white, instead of clear like the bottle that just went empty.<br /><br />I used it on my car, but I am highly suspicious, as it is NOT THE SAME KLASSE.<br /><br />If this is the new formula, I will search for a new leather cleaner/conditioner solution.
B00VVWZ9JI|4|Nice covers, keeps the dog from messing up the seats, includes covers for head rests which I like too. Good colors, black with red piping.
B00252GHK8|5|Good on VW TDI as a larger filter option.
B00BJCN80M|5|Waxing pad, not much to it, does its job.
B004MS9VTW|3|I'm a motorcycle mechanic by trade. If your considering this tool for a 520 chain or larger and plan to use often I would suggest a different chain tool.  I have not yet used this chain tool however I am very familiar with other professional chain riveters. This compared is smaller in size, more ideal in my opinion for bicycle or cam chains. If used correctly I'm confident the pit posse chain tool will be sufficient and work well. I'll update once I've used it a few times.
B011NKV6VW|3|The light is not too strong
B0060ZB43G|5|Installed these on my Honda Cruiser.. excellent deep tone. Very pleased with the performance
B001GC3BWU|4|Nice tone takes the edge off stock baffles but still good
B004A56Q86|5|Perfect fit.This fixed the rattling sound that the brakes made when driving over rough roads.
B00UFERZKO|5|I had to return the first one that was DOA.  The replacement process was super easy.  The second one showed up and works great!  I like that I can plug something in the USB without having to turn on the power switch for the outlet portion.
B004W4OPME|1|These look FANTASTIC on my Toyota Tundra but the quality of the light output is very weak even after adjusting them AND upgrading the blubs. Also you can't use your headlight adjusters to make them go up and down like you can with the stock ones. I ended up putting back on the stock ones because it was more important to me to be able to see and adjust my lights when towing. This is only a good product if you don't tow and don't drive at night.
B000R9T21M|5|Good as gold
B00B4L2MM8|5|Perfect fit for my 2008 Audi A5!
B000GTJ5I8|5|This is the most secure, versatile, and easy-to-use compressor that I have used.  I keep an external-type compressor as well, and between the two, they handle mostly any situation.
B00KWSEM5E|4|good price and product.
B00I3RL1A0|4|I wish they made the handle with a 1/2 drive instead of the t handle it was a job and a half to get the piston wound back
B002MQDY4O|5|Excellent
B009NTD3LW|5|Fit quick and easy and shipped on time to my door
B00FN36NZU|5|Work great and easy to install
B002UJVNFA|4|Was surprised when I got them. Lens are clear and not distorted.
B0080HJL7S|5|I received this car litter bag for review. This garbage can is a great size to hang on the back of a seat. It is well made with quality materials. The plastic liner makes it easy to clean, and prevents leaks.
B00CZEZNGU|1|hooked it up and it did not work
B0096GL09Y|2|The product received bent and has many dents.
B006QH6XQG|5|Perfect
B00407NK6A|4|Not the luster of real clear coat
B000CMIQ9I|5|This is the only cover gasket to use. They just work.
B000HBGJG6|5|My husband likes white lithium grease for many applications. When I saw this form, I thought it would be worth trying. It is a good product to have on hand. I used it to lubricate the door hinges on our old Volvo and the latch on my chicken coop. It is not messy and comes with a straw for direct application.
B000VVVER6|3|O RING SEAL WEAK
B00XHPM5R6|5|Ships fast foods good works good
B005G6KITQ|5|I love this sticker.It looks fabulous on my van window. Thanks! Might have to order some for gifts for my traveling caravan friends...
B00GWEUU5S|5|worked perfectly for my 2002 ford explorer
B00062YWB0|5|no problems
B00P8ZAR6E|5|Installed on jeep Cherokee look and works excellent
B00JH24K9O|5|Works great. Fit just right and my atv started up first try.
B000GAD05G|5|my engine never ran smoother
B00E9EOOLY|5|Exact original part easy to install
B000CO7CWI|5|Price was good the the item and its Made in America
B0066S4CSQ|5|Everything was great!
B00N7KNDBI|5|My husband has this on his truck. It's been there for several months and is holding up fine. Looks great too!
B004IYWIVS|5|wouldn't suggest anyone else but dorman love dorman products
B000C57W7C|5|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B00QMWKOTC|5|Great quality. Fits well.
B003ZMDAJS|4|Really good
B0013916XW|4|Looks good installed easily!
B007G2KL2M|3|We put it in front of our tent worked well kept a lot of the debris out
B00WA4ARO8|1|Fit nice and is keeping my floor of my new truck clean!!!  Great value!!!
B005PZMKZI|1|Did not fir car as advertized!
B000B7RCLM|5|Delivered as promised. Happy with my purchase.
B00E0VBY32|5|Very satisfied!
B00CUREA5C|5|At first, I didn't think this towel worked that well but then I made two changes and it works great!!! First, despite everyone's advice about not drying your car in the sun I did it anyway and the towel left my car full of streaks.  Once I tried drying it in the shade, the towel worked great.  However, I found that I could not dry my entire car with just one towel (I have a Toyota Camry).  I could make it about half way and then the towel would be too wet and start to leave streaks.  So, I purchased another towel and with two I can get my car completely dry and it looks great every time.
B000GU3EB6|5|Luv these ......kewl look ......nice nice fit over glasses
B00IS967M0|5|These look great and not cheap. They have a carbon fiber look to them, and they have 3M double sided tape on the back. Put on in about a minute, and they fit the same as oem. I have a 2001 supercrew flareside.
B00WGBVAQO|1|This kickstand was defective  .horrible
B000CF5U76|5|Exactly what I ordered and needed.
B000BZX9ES|4|+Bought this pump as a backup for the one I installed in my tank.  The one I installed works great and was easy to install.
B00C6OGF3O|3|A+ on the rack. C- on the instructions.    Some key notes--the measurements sent were correct, but you have to be very mindful of the directions of the arrows. Worst case, block out a few hours from your day and call Rhino Rack (and talk to Gonzo).    I'm giving 3 stars due to the nightmares I will continue having about this installation.  The rack itself it beautiful and sturdy and I imagine I'll keep it for the life of the car.  Thanks, Gonzo!
B00DT1V82Q|5|Really nice helmet.  Modular design is cool. Tinted shade works great.  Light on back is A+++
B00V30J86I|5|What did I ever do before this?  It helps keep my purse on the middle compartment so I don't have to go dig for it out of the back of the car.  Love it!
B00K0T94LC|4|Certainly adds a lot of vroom,  almost feels like 100 octane... Engine runs very smoothly when this stuff is mixed into the fuel.<br /><br />Expensive so can't use it all the time...
B000CRKTEI|5|Great one wire system for Mopars, 440 powered car.<br />Had to build brackets and fab out of stock parts, works grat and Charges,, thaks
B00L4GZKDG|5|Was the correct switch--quick delivery
B00CMX3JUQ|5|Fits great, no problems, well worth the money
B0009IQX5E|5|It's Meguiar's, would you expect less than 5 stars?
B00IQVBVO4|5|Perfect!
B001AD1GEA|4|The dark smoke was just what I wanted. Your face isn't visible through the visor and provides enough tint that your not being blinded during sunny days. Doesn't work well for riding at night. Not so much the tint but, because there is a lot of light hazing or halo from car headlights that shows through the visor. I have the transitions visor that I use when I know I'll be riding into the evening. I like the versatility of the transition visor but, your face is visible in the sun and it's ability to darken diminishes over time.
B0000C6FOM|5|Great My Dad really liked these they seem to be of a fine quality and they are adjustable. Needed them because we couldent see the trailer behind the truck to back it up. It works great and guides the boat onto the trailer fine. Price seems high given the materials involved but I guess your paying for the convenience over making these yourself. They are hastle free to install and work great.
B008G3CJE8|5|Is good product I am happy what I get
B00IX5MRD2|5|It was a very quick install and the image looks amazing. I bought the extra set to do all four doors.
B00FW4P5C2|5|Everything needed and fit exactly as it should.
B005L13NZM|4|Got in a day early put it but one snap does no hold so far the glue it not holding so going to try so supper glue to see if it will hold any suggestions on what type of glue to use
B004W4MB8O|4|Hooked up fine. No complaints looks better then what I had on before.
B001P2EIOG|4|Mounting them was a snap, I spent about an hour total. The only concern I have is how long they'll last with our midwest winters and the salt they use.
B00NF1Q7TY|5|Exactly what I ordered.  EZ install.  Same as the original. Serving its purpose well.
B0040CTUAA|4|Ever have that utto moment when you're parking your car and pull a tad too far into the curb and bottom out. Come on don't deny it!  It's happened once, twice....Well, fear not these little do hickies, fit the bill to clip right back up that plastic undercarriage!  Welll, it at least worked liked a charm for my driving 2002 Altima Machine!!
B0075DNCY6|5|Awesome quality. Part is not exactly the same Than original but fits perfectly in 2007 mazda3.<br />And thickness of the Brass terminals is greater than original part...<br />Actually gonna buy another pair just in case...
B000VL23XU|3|Looks ok, but it didn't come in the original box, so I have no idea if it's actually a Wix filter.
B002UBZJVC|5|It was a perfect fit.
B001ELRO1M|5|Outstanding car care products in a tool bag.
B00ZV1MNNK|3|They weren't easy to install and they didn't come with a manual.
B005FUWWWY|3|They shorted me one bulb but great quality.
B0002F9YHS|4|works well , does what it says it does.
B00U8NY2T4|5|Nice product cheap too
B0002ZGBRY|5|Not sure why more people don't use fusible links anymore? A fusible link protects the wiring itself from the battery or power supply up to the fuse or breaker panel. Can't tell you how many times I have seen or replaced melted wiring harnesses that could have been prevented with a fusible link.<br />Many people think the fuse or breaker in cars is to protect everything, but it's not. Those are there to protect the equipment and the wiring from the fuse/breaker to the equipment but NOT from the fuse/breaker back to the battery or power supply.<br />Would recommend a fusible link on older model cars & restoration projects. A general rule of thumb is to use a link approx. 6&#34; long that is two sizes smaller than the wire you want to protect coming from the battery. So a 10 AWG primary wire would need a 14 AWG fusible link.<br />When wiring cars, I recommend fusible links, reset circuit breakers (like ones offered by Blue Seas) and upgrading grounding systems.
B00D4NJOPC|2|Blocks view of my screen display, I had to cut it back, does not lay flat, does not stay attached to the all the velcro
B00DJ2D45O|5|Best esy
B00BRHZLZO|5|this is a great product for the engine bay, and wait a few minutes and hose off. Remember keep your vehicle running when hosing off the degreaser.
B00HW58R92|4|The u-shaped metal tool included in this kit works on a 2014 Freightliner Cascadia.
B00FBL2XSA|4|Easy installation  (although it took two people ) gives vehicle that thick grip but with a classy look.
B00CITW3YW|4|Ok they fit good...still have some gaps near the door. I think a section of double sided tape or Velcro will fix this. Reduced the amount of sand and.rocks in the carpet a bunch. The back mats fit perfect. I would buy again.
B000C5C4QG|5|Less than half cost compared to dealer, and its a name brand.
B000EGNAYS|5|I have replaced my old 10 series flow master with the cherry bomb vortex on my 02 ram 1500 4.7L what a difference dip sound at low rpm and it goes louder when you step on the gas love the sound For half the price
B000E0R0D6|4|the compressor worked great.
B00MI3WIN4|1|The part didn't fit my 2015 bmw x1 , it had no instruction as how to install it to my car I had to send it back . I had no problem In getting my money back ...
B004INRNTG|5|Perfect!
B005PSPD22|3|No screwdriver received as shown.... however good price
B013L54JXY|5|Great tools, works well for disassembly of smartphones, just used it for disassembly of my Note 5.
B00KOU2UYU|5|If you're looking to level your Chevy or GMC, get this kit. For $40 it can't be beat. There are other kits you can buy like Rough Country but they are plastic or welded. This is the real deal, machined from billet and then anodized for corrosion protection. When I looked at the others and saw what they were made of or how they were built it was a no brainer....you want the MotoFab kit. Plus the others were more expensive. Install took about an hr with a jack, 2 jack stands and hand tools. The overall effect was great. My 2011 Z71 sits level now without the nose down rake. With the stock tires on the stock rims I had 8&#34; of clearance from the top of the tire to the front fender and 8.5&#34; in the back so even though the spacers are only 1.25&#34; thick it results in a 2.5&#34; lift which is the perfect amount to level you truck. The kit allows you to run 33&#34; tires as long as the rim backspacing is sufficient, you can go slightly larger with stock rims but those 18&#34; OEM rims limit your tire choices. Best to get new 17X9 ones. Now for those new tires and rims I've always wanted. lol
B00XXSQIHA|5|love it
B001MPY4ZO|3|Work good for wax
B00198J0X0|5|Nice
B000CIR1QG|5|AS EXPECTED
B0002NIKVG|3|its okay. It does bend a lot.
B00LNJI1KI|4|Good for the price
B0009IQZH0|5|These are good for spills as well as for mopping my brow.
B00FBKWG60|1|Purchased 2 sets of these.  1 set lasted 3 or 4 days and the other went out before we even hit the end of the drive way.  Very disappointed
B00YDKXZI2|5|Just what I wanted!!!
B0002YUQ4E|5|Fantastic product. Restored my 65 stang bumper to near new. Took a lot of elbow grease, but totally worth it
B00DTBU6AG|4|The seat is great but you will have to screw in under seat to catch mounting holes. Difficult to quick connect but once connected feels great.
B00CD9IBF2|4|Sunshade was very effective and blocked most of the heat. Otherwise, it was very hard to fold into is pouch to store
B00KSLVEAG|5|I  bought this carburetor instead of rebuilding the stock carburetor on a 2006 kfx 400. This doesn't have the throttle position sensor but does have the vacuum return to the gas tank stopcock. Once installed, atv idled and ran perfect. Tps is unnecessary. Cleaned and sold stock carb for more than I paid for this unit. Totally happy and would buy again.
B00062Z46C|5|fast ship and as described
B00ANC3DUY|5|It great
B006ZSUR5O|5|Very Gooooooood
B00K7935KQ|5|Cheap plastic license plate frames, they're great for the price.
B00GHSDJCA|4|It is doing what it was made to do. I like it.
B003VARGVM|5|Excellent product.  Bottom receiver to tow car, top receiver perfect for bike rack
B000E0RAR2|5|works great, fits perfect
B005EMOPY6|5|good fit
B006STTIVY|1|Doesn't work that well.

B00BQTF0Z4|5|great price
B0002UHVTQ|5|THESE SOCKETS MAKE IT EASY TO INSTALL 12VDC OUTLETS IN OUR TRAILER, HAVE BEEN TESTED WITH RADIO & LAPTOP WORK GREAT...
B00LTX840A|5|100%
B00RSM6NGI|5|Perfect fit, great item
B00A82A2ZS|5|Worked great in the kids powered car. Great price!
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Perfect lighting, bright WHITE.
B000CCMLD0|4|Good product this is a small size can arrived on time
B00H5A40BI|5|My van is working like new again.<br />Excellent product.
B00WKZXXW0|5|Came fast and looks good.  No scratches yet after a few months.  Will buy again.<br /><br />Edit:  I've bought 4 more and have now used them on all my cars.  The plate doesn't fit inside of the cover, but that is not a problem.  It looks good and protects the front license plate.
B0041MTABS|3|Make sure you order the right thread and fitting size.
B00IEKOSTM|5|Love it.  Looks like it is made well, time will tell.  It has good stopping power.  It is made in China, but it seems everything is made in China
B000RLPNLI|5|great, thank you
B00E7VF17K|5|Nice addition to my Dodge Dart. Love it!!
B007PLZGO2|5|People either laugh hysterically at this sticker or glare at it. Either way it's hilarious. My brother liked it so much I got one for him as well.
B000CIT3N0|5|Looks good and arrived on time.
B00JFDIV4A|5|Perfect fit.
B0002STSQ2|5|good deal
B000C16XLC|4|Yes about and hour install thanks Dorman.
B00A6AS6LY|5|good for automotive shop
B00KB38WBA|5|Looks good and it's well built.
B00CHSTGKI|5|Legit oem part.
B000C122LM|4|Good fast service great price
B000C17G5E|5|Well packaged. All gaskets were included. LOVED the newly reinforced design that eliminates the leak problem. Shipped fast. Thanks Dorman!
B009WD6OV0|5|Item was as described.
B003XLAVO8|4|Was very easy to install with the detailed instructions.  I was able to install in about 1.5 hours using a small jack.<br /><br />I have a 2013 Ford Explorer and after install, there is an about 1.5 inches space between vehicle and board.  Not too bad but would of been better if there wasn't any space. I understand that this wasn't really a custom but more of a general board for my vehicle but again, it doesn't look bad.<br /><br />Construction seems good with rubber for grip on top.  These running boards have 4 brackets (bought separately from Dee Zee) so 2 brackets each side.  I'm a little concern that it doesn't have  center bracket but I bought these mainly for the kids to step on so shouldn't be no problem there.  I just wouldn't stand on the center and start hopping on it...
B00LG07MZE|5|Excellent
B00NS6Z3AK|5|Good price for a gas filled shock.
B006FUT05U|5|So easy to use after washing with Gold Class Car Wash, just spray, wipe off, and buff.  My new car and I love it because I haven't waxed a car in years, am 72 years old and handicapped,, so it had to be easy and effective.  I even used it on my bath fixtures and shower rod that were water-spotted or rusting and it looks as though the protection will last for a while.  I couldn't be happier!
B00NI457I0|5|Bought these for my 04 S4. I was nervous about buying a kit that was so cheap, the fitment of the control arms was absolutely perfect! The sway bar links were a little different, however they went on just fine. The nuts and bolts were a nice touch, they also fit perfectly. I will try and add to my review in 6 months for updates on how the kit holds up.
B000EBMKAS|4|Would like to have had a memo pad location, but it's much nicer/more convenient and adaptable than the much cheaper kind, two halves each with only one plastic window.
B00VT02ZEE|5|Easy to install works very well on vehicle looks good
B00651C2E0|5|On time and ok
B002ZTGLFC|5|I've used this hose on a scooter rebuild and my classic motorcycle restore, great stuff! The tubing connections to nipples almost self-sealing, top tip- use a hair dryer to heat connects up for removal during service. Only recommend use in areas with low heat transfer, it really saves room compared to traditional rubber hose.
B004YEIRAI|2|This product that I need it and a great service also.
B001KQF6PC|5|Good
B005JWCH0A|4|Was definitely a snug fit but overall so nice. it's thinner than my old one so i get a better grip on the steering wheel. It still gets hot but NOT overly hot in the summer months. Definitely better than my older one. The print is also really cute. Now i want one in every color, the only thing that stops me is the tight fit so it's hard to put on. but overall really nice and well made.
B0042H8TV4|4|Great for applying wax
B000PWWX0S|5|Perfect fit.
B0024ECDL4|5|Excellent quality. Easy to thread on. Does what it supposed to.
B00KIC860Q|1|No two sided tape was included so they fell off.  When I bought the sided tape they fell off when I opened the back doors.
B002UZP1GQ|5|It's great
B00AKEVVWW|5|Just as good as the mega expensive OEM filters!
B0050HGZC0|5|This is so easy to use.  Really cuts down on the wear and tear of the tag, and my arm!  We live in a community that is golf cart accessible.  I chose to purchase an additional sleeve to set up on my golf cart.
B00FHMH6E4|2|Old parts would not trans fer, was given credit!
B00HUMSWQK|5|Oz is very good at customer service and responding to questions . Got the light bar in 2 days . I have put many light bars in my off road vehicle and this one seems very good quality . Also must say the led in this bar is extremely bright . For the money there is no other light bar in its class. Bought the 12&#34; one to mount as well due to this one being good quality .
B00W5MG8XY|3|I felt compelled to leave this review given there are so many positive five star reviews out there. This is a great product with one major flaw that did not occur for me to confirm until I used it - a nozzle to bleed air out of the tire. For a product at this price point I would expect that comes standard. Other than that it's a great product.
B000EVWDAK|3|2004 Chevy Avalanche
B010MX4N0W|4|Just got the new fender eliminator in and it's blinkers where not lined up correctly, but I'm a perfectionist! I have yet to mount it on the 2015 grom. The instructions could use some work very basic and could see where it could confuse someone that is not mechanically inclined and the directions don't state anything about the flasher!
B0002SR4Q8|5|Great product very good prise fast shipment I recommend.
B00L5ICY7I|5|Great product, excellent and fast delivery
B00EDWF1BE|5|My hood shook terribly before I bought these but now it stays in place and give the Jeep a nice look.
B00K6L3CEO|5|Received. Stored
B0137B5HEC|5|If you own a jeep these are a must.  Bright and looks very cool.  Literally took 20 minutes to install.  Plug and play.
B006I26MEM|5|its original and new
B000GZXAD8|4|Nice battery. Good price. Dealership wanted $140. I had to buy two electrolyte (sulfuric acid) containers at $10 each. It took one and a half. Also, when you're pouring the acid into the battery, even micro splashes will destroy the clothes you're wearing. So don't wear anything you like.
B001BK062K|5|Really reasonably priced, good quality, easy to install.
B00S3FGYCM|5|Very nice and beautiful
B005S2BKDQ|5|Wish this stuff was cheaper.  My car requires 93 octane and all that sold locally is 92.  Thought it would be much of a difference running 92 but my IAM is running from .30-.40  (knocking).  I boosted it up to 93/94 using Torco and it's running a solid / steady 1 which is where it should be at.  I'm  a happy camper.
B006FTO8H6|5|A+
B001QIYAQ0|5|handy scan tool, has more feature than a basic code reader.  it paid for itself after using it 2-3 times.
B00XZ9PHYM|1|Did not start car only unlocks it
B005WWOL9C|3|Looks great only disappointment is it was delivered with a dent right on the stinger never noticed it until everything was installed on the jeep. It's a big bulky heavy bumper it's less of a hassle to live with it then take it all apart and send it back
B001JT5QNW|5|Easy to install
B00GD2BZL2|5|FUNNELS. they funnel very well, and with the assortment of sizes, are super convenient.
B00CHCPT32|5|Very well built mirrors. Sturdy, don't vibrate and move around on you. Look much better than the factory set as well.
B000CO7EBM|5|Got two for my 86 K5 blazer and they fit perfectly
B00S0FOD14|5|Excelente producto
B00QRTJ94G|3|Sucking hot air.
B0053ZJ3CS|3|It's a little big for my taste-
B000CAINDE|1|Product was as expected for the first 6 months or so. Then, the fabric trim started disintegrating. Left powder-like remnants all over my dash and car. I realize it is only $9, but the quality of the materials is terrible. You definitely get less than what you pay for.
B000AA4RWM|5|Easy to put in.
B00H3C4GLM|4|They were a little snug to get on there and they are harder to push down than stock struts but they get the job done.
B00XN2XLQ2|5|My car thanks you!!!
B00BG6IJA0|2|I get that this is a low profile jack, but it barely lifts my car higher than the jack that is attached to my doughnut. I needed to do some work and this thing was kind of a hassle. also the handle is just annoying. I really wish I had spent some more money to get a regular jack.<br /><br />pros. Cheaper than any other jack. decent build quality. very very very light for a jack. quick assemble handle.<br /><br />cons. quick assemble handle easily falls out all the time. doesn't lift very much or very high.
B00BJOXV8E|5|Best K member out there by far, one piece construction, super strong. Multiple engine capacity, what JE wanted to make...
B0007IJR1I|5|This product works wonderfully! Don't even try to look any other product, this is the right choise.
B0031KOM28|4|Just what we were looking for!
B00WW87PVK|5|Item was as described and worked great.  Instructions were clear and concise and price was a great deal.  Would highly recommend buying from company again.
B00FW1JSUA|4|Everything about this light set was great except for the reverse lights which explains the 4 star rating. All the bulbs fit with little effort and are amazingly bright! I love how the interior is filled with the super white light from these LEDs. Now the only con, although the look of the reverse LED light was super white and clear it just didn't light up the surrounding area when reversing. The stock bulb was actually brighter.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Great product
B00A8XHH6Y|5|Even the Uhaul people where impressed with this. If your going to put a tow rig in your truck put a Tow Rig on your truck. It was also $200 cheaper here then the  website.
B005PWU882|5|Worked fine on my dirtbike
B0037WM4GG|5|THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT WHEN YOU GET A SQUEAK FROM THE COIL AND AGE WEARING IT OUT. VERY HARD TO FIND IN THE LOCAL AREA.
B003TYOJSS|5|love the way it feels and fits
B00LGNM7G0|5|This is my second one purchased but not because it was a bad product.  Some one ran into the first one and cracked the lenses.  This is super bright and long lasting led bulbs. Love it
B00BFDGL4K|3|The key was fine, but the AAA licensed (or whatever) key shop that told me it could program it was unable to and in fact messed up the computer in my car so that my keys no longer function electronically.  Since they were a small shop I did pay them the $100 shop time it took them to do that.  I am looking forward to my 30,000 mile dealership checkup and hoping they can rectify matters for less than the $200 they originally wanted to charge me to replace one key.  My advice?  Acchh!  Don't have any.  Good luck.  This is a good example of how income streams will be developed one way or another.  We all need to eat - but really, something is wrong with this picture.  Be very careful using these electronic keys manually, it is easy to break them off in the lock.  I haven't done that yet, but know people who have.
B006WQSWQA|5|Im going on a year with these hubs and they are still working great.  Easy install and professional service
B000WG9PJY|5|Repaired the stripped threads
B00RW7XD1W|5|These windshield wipers were easy to install and do a great job. I will keep buying them in the future.
B000EQS1RY|1|Installed switch,worked 1 day, hit bump in roadway,window went down by itself,now switch is always activated in down position!!
B00D9C2CDO|4|Worked fine ( Honda 2014 Pilot , factory roof rack.  Pulled the straps really tight,  Used duct tape to prevent the ends from flapping. Drove for 2:45 minutes at the speed limit ( 55-65)  no issues.  Just pack it full with soft items
B00N4M95XO|3|Update: after 6 months the front seat light bulb has started to fail. It looks like a strobe light in the Jeep. Good thing I don't have epilepsy.  So, I love these things. Let there be light!!! My girlfriend however, believes they are TOO bright. That means they're prefect! 08 JK Rubicon Unlimited
B00L2NF1XA|5|Item was exactly what was pictured. Heavy duty, not cheapy thin rubber. Very happy with my purchase. Fast shipping too.
B00CASDZKC|4|They work well wish the bottom strap was a little different.
B00LEHDWWQ|5|Love them
B007Y87WDO|2|Alternator failed after one week of use, in the process of requesting a refund.
B00AWVGGDM|5|Great protection, good for the bumper. Easy to install
B008YAZK30|4|THEY LIGHT UP UH WHAT ELSE CAN YA SAY LOL
B00450I2MY|5|Great replacement part
B000C6ZQ1K|3|I cannot give it a real review as the problem was, ultimately, not a failure of the check valve but the brake booster itself. It appeared to fit correctly for the application so I can only rate it to a limited extent.
B001HSIBOQ|1|The fuel pump worked great the second time I installed it after completing the job and trying to start the truck I had no power to the fuel pump so I removed the tank and pump again and found that the pigtail they supply pushed a wire out and was not making contact with the other pin once I repaired the pump worked fine however  I had to drop the tank twice that's why only one star.
B001RAQGXC|4|Read the other write-ups and be patient.  The splashing is minimal, but I put a tarp on the hood & roof just in case - and the cleanup of the splashes is simple with a wet paper towel (don't try to buff the splashes off).  Keep the polish and pad wet and keep going over the scratched areas and it does the work for you.  Keep at it until the scratches are fully gone - it may take a few waves but also won't take you very long.  I had a full windshield covered in wiper blade scratches from having had a set of Anco contour wiper blades which did a terrible number on my Hyundai Genesis.  (remember to replace your wiper blades as well!)
B00KQ81M94|1|i don't know what the fuss about Man sham. It works no better than a high end microfiber towel i got about the same price point. With the money i spent on it i could have bought another 4-pack microfiber towel. I followed the instruction to soak it in warm water for 10 minutes. I notice some yellow color came off in the water. It didn't pick up all the water. It left a thin layer of water on the car's surface. I had to squeze the water out more more often becuase it doesn't soak up the water as much. The thin surfave area is probably the main factor. When using a microfiber i had a clean bucket of water and rise it off everytime. The soaking allows debris and dirt to not stick to the towel surface scratching the car. I am afraid of ripping the Man Sham each time i squeze it Microtowel picked up more water than Man Sham! With Man Sham you essentially use it over and over again and increasing the chance of scratching the paint surface. This product is over rated. It is rubbery and sticky making one handed operation difficult. I dropped it on the ground several times. I found it most effective when using both hands. I am not happy with the purchase at all. Better stick with a machine washable microtowel that glide over the car surface easily and soak up more water and cheaper than this product.
B00HJ15AFS|3|The frame is really big. I was hoping that it would be smaller and more compact to fit a license plate, but it goes beyond me license plate on even the indents on the bone where it should be touching my license plate. It's nice for some bling, and it's cute that it's a dog bone, I just wish it fit a little better.
B000GV3TVU|5|Very nice
B0001EFSTI|5|Good job.
B00YJL9PIO|5|Great product, quick Shipping and couldn't beat the price. My suv rides like new again.
B00B3YLN9E|4|So far, I really like it. It seems to be keeping up with my regular use seen I use my motorcycle to commute. There are a lot of straps to adjust as needed, and the top pouch is nice if needed. It easily holds a lot! I think the only thing I didn't like was the rain cover because it was meant to cover the whole pack with the top pouch, so it does a lot of flapping in the wind if the pack isn't full. Other than that, I like it so far! The only thing I don't like, is the rain cover. It probably protects the top of the bag, but even with cranking the strap as tight as I could, a lot of water went in through the bottom.
B00DSMEL2A|5|good thanks
B001KSCSQU|5|Yes
B0013FP0ZG|5|Installed on the front drive shaft of my 2005 Nissan Xterra 4x4 manual. Works great so far and got rid of the knocking noise and vibration caused by the previous U-joint which had failed. Installation was fairly simple, and I was able to rent a U-Joint press from auto-zone for free.
B00K1MMS9I|5|Fine part fitting for the vehicle intended.
B0009IQZH0|5|very impressed with product
B00OAN3Q90|5|Nice.just the right size antenna!
B001IOU3WM|5|Ok
B0000AXY62|5|Again a great lock
B004MVW0DS|5|Excellent, will recommend to everyone!
B003R4TGGA|5|It fitted great.  Good delivery time
B0015MGB32|5|worked great
B00JXS3BXI|5|2012 JK. Fit perfect on Barricade HD Trailforce bumper. Wiring harness was excellent length to run throigh grill and tuck under hood along passenger side.  Have used this several times pulling folks out of the mud.  Definitely worth the money.
B000NWA8HU|5|Correct part,Great Price,Fast Shipping
B00AKA6LXA|5|This is a good wrench for home use. However, it is not a proffessional grade item.
B008EMBMMG|3|Did not match with the front set.
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fit perfectly
B00NE33M78|5|Locally it was 96.00 for one light we got 2 for 29.99 plus shipping. Same exact ones, great deal!!!
B006N95PHA|5|Excellent Product.
B00QVQ2UAK|5|they work
B00I9SK8WK|5|Easy to use and does what it is supposed to do!
B00PGJDTWQ|1|junk
B00FM8F3R0|5|Holds GPSmap 62S very well. It is a little bit difficult to get the charging cover removed in order to plug it in once it's in the cradle. Also, the roller rattles in the vehicle if the gps is not mounted.
B0076IAIWO|5|Bought this cause i needed to smog my civic and it was throwing out a p0420 code. I installed this on my driveway, drove it around for a bit. Code didnt pop back up, so i took it to get smoged and it passed.
B0054KW4A0|5|Worked the first time easy to set
B005GL8I9S|2|Here's the review I first gave:  &#34;Actually, it's a pretty good cover, particularly for the price.  It seems to be longer-lasting than covers I have paid twice as much for, and also has a good stretch band to hold it on the car when it's windy.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't really fit the car. In fairness, that's probably because my Camry is an old one, and the cover is probably fitted to newer Camrys, which I will have to assume are smaller.&#34;  Now, here's the follow-on:  the cover shredded after just over a year.  I'll have to buy a new one now.  I'm  not going to get it from the same vendor.  It should have lasted more than a year - other covers have a 3-year warranty, which would mean it would have been replaced.  Look elsewhere.
B00DF8C25U|5|part worked great and was easy to install! Would recommend this to anyone
B009E9J1Y4|5|Really worked well.  Just like the original.
B0042ORWRY|5|Great!
B000GVH18C|5|After installing... It was like an Autobot had been awakened...
B00YIL7XX4|3|I have not put enought miles on the brakes to rate the brake pads at this time.  Ray Meisner
B00DGTHA3C|5|Excellent product and fast delivery
B0000AXDB3|2|This product is well made, comes in a handy case and seemed like a good idea. So far it had been totally ineffective. My backhoe/loader has five grease joints that won't take grease. I've worked for 2 days with the Rejuvenator trying to clear the joints without success. Tried loading it with PB-Blaster, penetrating oil, and even carb cleaner. After hours of tapping that thing, removing the Zerks and soaking the joints, it hasn't cleared one joint! I was able to remove the pin in the loader bucket joint and clear it by drilling out the hardened grease. To disassemble the remaining four joints is not practical since it would require removal and dis-assembly of the backhoe. I had high hopes for the Rejuvenator, but unfortunately it didn't do the job for me. In fairness, I bought the backhoe used and it probably has years worth of deferred maintenance. Too tough for the Rejuvenator.
B000LG1OO4|5|Awesome.  Better design than the stock exhaust.  Much deeper growl, especially when accelerating.  Also, there is noticeably more horsepower.  Very happy with it and would buy again but won't be needing one for a few years as I went with the stainless steel exhaust.  Gibson is made in USA which was a selling point.  Didn't realize the chrome tip was included so that was a bonus.
B00C5SW24W|4|Better choice than 40631 plumbing fit well,,, so far so good !!
B00C0YQXYQ|5|Work well. Great price!
B002J7VX4Y|1|Horrible synthetic plastic smell.  Avoid
B004GDNM20|5|Great product for the money. Just as described, fit my regular cab 2001 Tacoma perfectly.
B0080DIYDE|5|Exact replacement.
B00ED6CH5I|5|The fit is  fine and  the price is reasonable. And, they cleanup nicely.
B005MJYTRE|1|I'm a small framed woman and while this brace was adjustable across the chest the actual shoulder area is still too wide. Even with the X strap I was not able to adjust it to be small enough to provide my shoulder with any compression. It also it not designed with a woman with boobs in mind. Completely uncomfortable and ridiculous. The Shock Doctor one at least takes boobs into account although it was too big as well. I tried a few and the one I ended up with was the McDavid one, very simple Neoprene. Only one that was easily adjustable to my size.
B0013V6NBA|4|Well made, but wish there were more details in the palm trees. Very shinny. Looks good.
B001G7GAHS|5|These fit perfectly and are exactly as described. A little expensive though as I've seen them elsewhere now for cheaper. But considering their quality it is still a great purchase
B000RXNLK6|4|Good product
B001DRLQ34|5|super cheap, and fits perfectly!<br /><br />I can't ask for a better combination..
B002D3KR4Q|5|As advertised. Looks like it came on the car
B007KPTRWU|4|Overall, I like this peg.  It looks good and it's inexpensive.  However, this is the 3rd time I've bought this exact same peg, since it came loose and fell off at highway speeds.  I'll take the blame for it, though.  I should have used a little dab of loctite or something.
B0002L6GLE|5|Fits GREAT&#62;
B00MB0EX46|5|Seems durable and it's simple and cute!
B000CO9U32|4|Sounds great definite better throttle response, but have not seen any mileage improvement
B001PWA0IO|5|Fits&works as advertised,simple gizmo but makes opening tail gate with hands full a breeze
B00TI6GBZU|1|very poor quality plastic, very soft. strips very easily even with the right sized hand screwdriver
B00LN0H0O0|1|Every second bulb is defective
B007X4FD7Q|5|I got these to get rid of the annoying dash display fog light caution caused by using non OEM bulbs from eBay.<br />They're yellow halogens if anyone is wondering.
B004A6KAE6|4|box was torn open when delivered luckily radiator was not damaged. fit perfect as stated. thank you. saved a ton of money too.
B0058EK88M|2|Thought they were going to be a better fit
B00UB3M6FI|4|The size of the sticker is good, however I would recommend ordering a white or any other brighter color, so that it's easier to see either on the bumper or back windshield. It all depends on the color of your car and whether your windows are tinted. Other than that it's great.
B000FQ27YG|3|1/4 INCH TALLER THAN ORIGINAL.
B00LO20AIK|3|This product should work well for most uses. The problem is the power output is a square sine wave (dirty) and isn't so good for your electronic devices. I had an iPhone 4S plugged in to this inverter in the car and all of a sudden my screen would freak out like there were multiple fingers touching all over the place. I thought my phone was malfunctioning, but later I plugged my friend's iPhone 5S in and it did exactly the same thing. As soon as I removed the power cable from either of the phones, the screen would function normally again.
B00GKC7ZFA|5|Cool cover...my HHR loves it!
B000OZS9Y0|5|Simple and easy. Totally worth the $$.
B006PIWWCK|4|Pleased with the sign.I was even able to remove it and reinstall it.Served my purpose, I have a dog that goes berserk when someone like the mailman  comes around.Definitely needed some kind of warning sign besides beware of dog.
B00I8IOQTC|5|Solid construction and a lot less expensive than the local auto parts store.  Highly recommend the purchase!
B0073ME7Y8|4|Good stuff. Got it quick and without issues. Thanks guys.
B000E24352|4|Good product, well made. I wish the description would give actual dimensions of latch mounting and span size so buyer could know if it will fit the intended use.
B00H9KHA4S|2|Extremely bulky when rolled up. I don't know where to store it while driving. Probably won't use on a regular/daily basis. Rather store it in the cargo area and only use on full day outings. Great coverage on the front window though.
B000EQVVN0|5|ACDelco products are Heavy Duty. I installed this on my 2003 Honda CR-V. This was easy to install with the use of a grinder to remove the old part.
B000NTF1BG|5|sweet
B00Y480W3Y|5|I received this as a free review sample. This is a no-frills charger that does exactly what the product description claims. In fact, this and its competitors (I have tested number of these products) all work like magic considering their size. Since there are ample product specs already on this page as well as a number of detailed reviews I am going to focus on facts and observations that have not been covered.<br /><br />First, this does - as I and others claim - work. This one was tested on a motorcycle out of the box and it started it immediately. Second, this is a no-frills package that comes in a plastic case and comes with adapters for laptops and other devices and, frankly, never use anything but the jump starting feature.<br /><br />Second, depending on where you are located this may or may not be the best solution. For example, the storage range is between 14 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. If you live in, say, Minnesota, the lower limit may be exceeded and the battery will not work. Also note that there is an operating range outside of which this battery may not work. That range is an ambient temperature between 32 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Even where I live the ambient temperature dips below 32, and the upper 104 degrees is not out of the question. For folks up north, the 32 degree lower limit can easily be a limiting factor. I am sure there is a tolerance range for the above numbers, but even at 20% the operating temperature's lower limit is in the 25 degree range. In the dead of winter in northern areas you may not be able to start your vehicle.<br /><br />Also note that this may not crank over engines larger than 4 liters. That is not an issue for most folks, but for some it will be, especially when the temperature ranges are factored in.<br /><br />While the above comments appear bleak, know that just about any battery using this technology will have the same limitations. In fact, compared to the competitors this battery is on par with the rest of them. I wanted to point out the limitations to ensure that you are totally informed and expectations set before you purchase one - either this one or a different brand. Especially if you live up north where the winters are harsh, or in desert areas where the heat inside your vehicle (where I assume you will store this battery) can exceed storage or operating limits.<br /><br />Finally, if you do intend to use this battery for charging laptops or other devices, know that while the actual storage capacity is 13600mAh, the actual charging capacity is around 10000mAh-ish. That's because all batteries using this technology lose about 30% of the stored capacity in the transfer process. Some from heat and the process itself, and some from cable inefficiencies.<br /><br />Bottom line: this battery does exactly what the specs claim. If you keep it at peak charge by charging it up every three months, you can expect to start a vehicle up to the claimed twenty times before you recharge it. Of course, that will depend on the factors that I mentioned above - all of which also apply to competing batteries based in this technology (nearly all on the market.) For what it is, does and its price range I awarded it my highest rating.<br /><br />Sample provided for review purposes.wanted to point out the limitations to ensure that you are totally informed and expectations set before you purchase one - either this one or a different brand.

B003POCPC4|2|While some may like this type I didn't.  You can not let it dry too long or use too much or it is like concrete and so difficult to buff out I had to use spray wax to get the dried residue marks off.  May be great for others but not for me.
B0049DQ75Q|3|The lug nuts work fine. The locks and keys however, cannot stand up to being torqued to 120ft/lbs. After using the key three times it began to bend out of position and is now very difficult to fit into the lock.

B00G30T6TM|3|good qualities LED not much to say its advertising az 9 of them but you actually need 10 the one goes under the steering wheel or glove compartment either or
B0091I1SD0|5|Works Great
B000E28JZC|5|Works good. My bike has 20K on it and probably never had a plug or filter change so I don't know if there is an improvement over the regular air filter when its not completely gunk ed up. My bike sounds quieter now. I have the 2 brothers carbon fiber exhaust and I was going to go deaf before and now it do sent bother me. 01 cbr 600f4I I bought this because they dident have stock one in stock and was same price but I can clean this.
B00BTLEHSK|1|So difficult to install had to return. I was unable to remove seats & headrests, all zippers were ridiculously confusing.
B001C6SK0S|4|works great, and perfect price..  :)
B00MOE31VA|4|soooo.. cute
B00470ZMA2|5|As advertized.
B00N3446NC|4|great!
B003ZIXJIE|5|worked well on my sieena se 2015 it does cover the toyota symbol on the hood
B00UNBBLT0|5|I put this on my Gen 2 KLR650 and am very pleased! Install was less than 5 minutes.
B0009IQZFM|5|My friend hand washes my car so I bough these to make his job easier. He loves them, we bought another one for his brother.
B001PR6HCW|5|Perfect.
B002SYSQWK|5|It Works well, I'm happy with it. Flipping, and changing the bonnet, is a snap. It adds little height the shaft, bet it's okay.
B00RV46YBC|1|i soooooo wanted these bulbs to work. They kind of do. I already have a replacement set but it exhibits totally different errors. Parking lights and turn indications work all the time on one bulb. If I move it to the other side, it works there too. The other three are a mess. One doesn't work at all. The other one the blinker works but not the parking light. The third works, but the blinker is white-yellow instead of off-yellow like the first bulb I mentioned. At some point, you walk away. This is that point. 08 JK Rubicon Unlimited.

B00W5BB2SG|1|Was more uncomfortable than the regular seat. Bunches up as well
B00DOHT0V6|5|Worked Perfect, used it to replace a missing electric tailgate windows switch for my K5 blazer.
B00FEXDYZQ|5|Quality was great, had to paint them black to shine it up a bit but that's just personal preference. Great product!
B000EPXKAI|5|good price and product.
B00Y85UM7O|5|Awesome sunscreens. We had tried the suction kind to keep the sun off the baby and they didn't cover the entire window. These are awesome in that they cover the entire window and do an amazing job at blocking the sun. We ordered the size small for our Chevy traverse and they work great! Would highly recommend. I was skeptical at first, but loving them!
B00HNMLQAG|5|Works great for its intended purpose.
B00KTI8UBE|5|Works great, thanks

B00032KC2G|4|Used on my 2014 Audi S4. The only reason for 4 stars is that they were way too long to fit the license plate holder and I had to grind them down to size.
B005UZIQME|5|Super easy to install. Took less than 10 minutes. Work very well
B00335M264|5|Fits as expected easy to install
B01092IFZK|1|After several attempts to install the seat covers I became aware how shabby the construction of the covers was. The zipper concept on a split beach seat left no way to secure the ends to allow continual use of the split concept.  Returning immediately.
B00COYNVKQ|5|gift for great-neice
B00BH1FPJW|1|They look great, but may cause damage to your Tire Pressure monitoring system.  If the threads seize up, the only way to remove the valve cap will result in a damaged sensor and instantly flat tire.  I learned the hard way, it costs about $80 for a new sensor.  I'm back to the ugly all-plastic caps.
B000CF8VUE|5|Great quality. Easy to install. Arrived on time.
B003WSNYXW|5|Being a survivor for over 17 years now I LOVE pink ribbon items! =)
B001P22OY2|5|It does its purpose of holding my Yakima bike rack onto me Jeep Wrangler.  I was sad when I upgraded from a Liberty to a Wrangler only because the tire in the back wouldn't allow for my bike rack to fit. I called the place that I purchased my bike rack and they suggested that I buy the tire mount rack, but I like the tray style rack for my bike because it is a carbon frame and I did not want the rack to attach to the top tube. I managed to keep my tray rack and my cool Wrangler with this awesome part. The only problem is that it isn't a snug fit and causes a little bit of a rattle.

B000GU7I72|4|I had to go with the XXL, 2 sizes larger than the one the fit guide recommended, to get a cover that fit over the saddlebags and crash bars on my Suzuki Boulevard C109R. A completely stock C109R might be able to pull off an XL (still a size larger than the recommendation at the time of this writing). Nice cover. Very similar in fabric weight to a tent, maybe slightly heavier. Condenses down to about the size of a small watermelon, so it's a bit bulky for travel, in my opinion. I'm using it primarily as an indoor dust cover so I can't attest to it being waterproof or not, but it does have a drawstring to cinch it up at the bottom once it's on so it won't blow away in the wind.
B00O83GY8W|5|great part
B00295T5DW|5|It put a nice thick coat on my brake calipers, looks really good!!
B000C7ZCHM|1|Didn't stay in my dash
B0052XN2RI|5|Fit great on our Dodge Ram truck.
B001DDMB2I|5|A lot of the reviews complain about the quality of this product. It is flimsy, but then it's a bunch of very, very, fine wires for cleaning out carb jets. I have no idea how this could be more robust without making a bunch of separate cleaner wires with individual handles.
B003RVHPY8|5|It does fit on my 2007 Nissan Altima
B00B0C14JS|5|The most amazing break upgrade for the price absolutely love love love them
B00M35143C|5|Exactly as described. Fit great. Highly recommend!
B000BGHYMU|2|It works but is very cheap built.
B00GG9FB8U|5|Amazing product. Use it with decent microfiber towels (I got 36 of them at Costco for $8) and this will look 10 times better than any other wash.
B00CHQ0F1E|5|So much better connection than crimping connectors.  You can apply stress and the will not disconnect.  Makes the best possible connection without solder and an iron.  Best way to make a wire to wire connection.
B00EDDALK4|5|very good fit and same as old one.
B0039BW3IE|5|Good as gold
B00SDMJLQ6|5|Fits my 2013 Ford Edge perfectly.  Having just had abdominal surgery, I needed something to make the belt bigger so it wouldn't rub my incision.  This worked like a charm.
B00W8SF6L0|5|Excellent
B005O3123M|4|Appears to be as advertised.  Have not attempted to install yet, holding off on 5 star rating pending completion.
B00UIPOB1Q|5|Great sticker. Have it on the back window for everyone to see.
B0030D6256|5|Exactly what I was looking for. I couldn't believe how cheap the price was. I ordered extras at that price just in case others broke.
B00DQ1RV70|5|Fit perfect, were not loose, and at a great price!
B00BITK0Q6|4|Just what I needed and arrived quickly.
B001CJHU9W|5|As described
B00NPQV06O|2|It was super bright at first with great flood area but has slowly faded over 3 months. It is now very dim. I used it as a porch light on my rv. Love the size and initial brightness just disappointed in the longevity.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I love my car windshield. I just bought a truck and was worried about it covering everything. It really works great. I like the fact that is does cover everything. I don't won't the sun to ruin my dash. It is a wonderful product.
B00IZ2CXPU|4|I mistakenly ordered these thinking i was receiving 6, my fault i guess, but otherwise these work as they should for my 2002 Yukkon. Still better price than local auto stores
B00F0OV89S|3|So I got the all in one polish and wax today.Applied it over a 12 .99 product did not see much difference not worth the money don't buy
B004W4OON4|5|Looks striking as hell, cuts through the night being one step below xenons. Car looks like a 2010 Celica instead of 2000. A+
B000EDQQD8|1|Always leaked couldn't get my refund
B00PV6VKRA|5|Easy mod that took &#60;10 minutes.  Great product!  I decided to keep the OEM license plate bulbs to help avoid attracting local law enforcement and avoid any possible issues with state inspection.
B00B1WBPMI|3|Very disappointed. There was no picture on the necklace. Not worth the money.
B000NVW1LM|1|Used product two different applications. Transmission and transfer case. Both failed badly. Leaks got worse by a factor of ten. would not recommend product. 0 rating
B001NZKDIA|5|Worked well
B0002UQAN4|1|Product did not work at all.
B00PWUKIJ6|3|Hard to install, gathers dust bad. Doesn,t match hood well.
B004L022IS|3|It appears the starter has an issue , I need to tap the seleniod to start the tractor , could be a bad ground though
B001445IZ8|4|works as described
B004MS09J8|5|Just like the oem part.
B003S6M4Z2|5|All good
B0071H3EYO|5|Got it for my Cousin to put on his noggin while he's Hoggin!
B00HE68CCQ|1|This was gray and not brilliant silver.  Poor match.  I'm very disappointed. And it is not because I did not know how to use it. My friend who is an experienced and very good auto body man helped. I threw it away after working on a couple of small spots.
B00AAZNWZU|5|Works like a champ
B0017LL3QQ|1|fit was perfect and reflected heat away from interior in a excellent manner...
B000CIOWIQ|3|Flimsy, doesn't fit radiator well.
B004RCZB38|5|Very practical and easy to store
B00IAHGUDQ|5|Excellent quality fit and finish. Good sound!!
B005FUUBZO|5|Easy pop-out, pop-in replacement of all 7 bulbs (2 map lights, 2 door/courtesy lights, 2 rear reading lights, trunk light) on my 2010 Nissan Altima.  the whole job took me about 20 minutes for the 7 bulbs and they light up the interior much better, with a much &#34;whiter&#34; quality of light.
B004LWV0GQ|5|did not have room to mount my gen4 battery charger on my boat, so I purchased 4 of these extension cables. I cut them, and permanently attached one end to the battery and the other to the charger creating 4 different quick disconnects. the battery end has a boot to keep the connection water proof when not charging. I am very happy with the results, this is the cats meow.
B00IWNK1YC|5|Item arrived quickly and was packaged nicely. Boxed up to prevent any folding in shipment. Product itself fits my car perfectly. I'd consider my car to be a mid-sized sedan for those looking to purchase this. The addition of the two suction cups prevents the shade from sagging. I would usually depend on the sun visors to hold up the shade. Not anymore! I'd definitely recommend this product especially for those who are Disney fans :)
B000VKRQBA|1|This was ordered for a 2010 Sienna. The Amazon app said it would fit a 2010 Sienna. It did not fit a 2010 Sienna. The sheet it came with said it was made for a 2012 or later Sienna. On the bright side, Amazon paid to ship it back, then refunded my money.
B005M29YEY|3|Very good product, look strong and comfortable,<br />But I need the longer one and if they make more colors to choose.
B005O011E0|5|Solid quality.
B00D3YEGO6|2|Ok I have been building and customizing cars for over 25 years with National awards and magazine publicized cars. My wife wanted a diamond plate frame for her Mini Cooper. I ordered this one as it looked well built.  It arrived wrapped in a  box that would be acceptable if your bought a piece of jewelry from Macy's. Problem is they put more thought into the box and rapping then the product.  Almost every auto made has it's license plate attached with tapping type screws. What is supplied with the kit is machine screws and nuts. Yes, you can screw these into your already tapped plastic nuts on your car but they will not tighten as they do not have the grip. Machine screws can't tighten into the plastic. The OEM tapping screws actually cut into the plastic and is how they retain their friction grip.  2nd problem is the frame comes bent. This causes the bottom to stick out like most have commented on in their pictures. This also causes the plate to now stick out 3/8 to 1/2&#34; and when you hit a bump the frame hits the cars frame and you here a noise.  3rd problem is the theft resistance screws will become an issue when comes time to actually remove the plate as they are recessed into the frames supplied small bezels.   So yes, like others have said you can jury rig this onto your car sit back and say &#34;Hey, look at my plate&#34;, but 10 miles later you will be missing one or the other.  This is what mfg has become. People trying to design the simplest thing with zero knowledge of even common hardware. It looks shiny so everyone runs to tell you how great it is but wait.....It doesn't work but who cares do you see how it looks????  Time to put the pieces back in the pretty box which really is amazing considering the price.e.
B001MOTZ8Q|5|As described and quickly delivered..
B00MNW3P0K|5|Best backrest I ever bought.  Fits like a glove, like it was made for me.  2014 Heritage Softail.  Love to ride in comfort.
B00MHXGL06|5|These are really bright lights and fit great.
B00G09LTAK|5|All pieces were there and nothing broken. Fast shipping. Tools works perfectly
B000Q71N8K|5|Cools right down, perfect for my needs.
B003DMFDM2|5|For the price this thing is great, assembled really easily and is strong enough for what I need with ladders and lumber. Very happy with my purchase.
B011CM96MW|3|Only one of them worked
B000WJ87PY|4|Very good quality but not comfortable enough.
B00EC2CG9U|1|totally disappointed. They hold nothing.
B003TPF0N0|5|So many cheap sprayers die almost immediately.  These are built to take most things you'w want to spray from a bottle.
B000S34NG6|5|It works as intented.
B011GWN0ZC|5|Arrived as expected.
B00LTHWV64|3|Exactly as described but I thought the metal plate was a bit thin.
B000E322C2|5|like it should
B001DIECCK|5|I actually had to use it on my car tire recently.  Worked like a champ!  was my first auto tire patch repair to complete and it couldn't have gone better.  driving the car some good distances next couple of weeks and no leak.. impressive
B000LNS4SQ|5|used it when I was 16yrs old works well on your wind shield and head lights
B001XUD46S|2|nice product, but.....my auto sensing windows wont allow the windows to close....sometimes.  It is a real problem trying to close my windows during a rainstorm and the window automatically switches direction, since it thinks something is caught in the window.  This all could be fixed, if the front part of the ventvisor were more flaired out and not causing an obstruction.<br />The product works as stated, but its a real pain in the a** to keep messing with it to close your window.  I've read that one customer ground down the area in question and has no problems, but once installed, who wants to take a grinder to their new truck, hoping they dont screw up the paint.<br />I should have gone with Weathertech, they fit much better and have none of these problems, but then, they cost twice this much.  Another problem is that these are glued in with 3M adhesive tape and if I try to rip them off, half my window seal will come with it.  They work, but I am not happy with them.
B007XE5LTG|5|First of all thank you Amazon for getting me this product  within 12 hours of my order. Next I have a 2006 Ford Focus, 2005 sport trac and a 1999 gmc suburban 2500 with 454 engine. My focus got the check engine light on for awhile I knew it was something minor but dealership wanted $125.00 for the reading. When I checked Amazon this scanner does everything. What I liked the most is that not only gives you the code number it tells you what it means. It is very easy to use and simple. Heck I didn't even read the manual. It's pretty much learn as you go. So in the end I checked all my 3 cars with this in less then an 30 minutes price being $45.00 I've already saved over $300.00. Again thanks
B00OUDD5M8|5|These fit really well on my VStar. They're good quality and don't rattle much at highway speeds. The mirror is fairly small, but more than you need for merging. You do have to readjust them after the first ride though.
B005I6J82M|5|Twice as bright as normal 194 bulbs. Great white light, not too blue or too yellow. Dimmable. Look great replacing light bulbs in an old Ford truck instrument cluster
B00JEUHVOU|5|Best mats I have ever bought. Will never need to buy another! These things are incredibly durable and fit snug! Will be buying for my other vehicles. They also clean very well. Just take out and hose and they look good as new ( which I need to do in the photo)   I have a automatic 2000 XJ, but there seems to be plenty of space for the clutch on the manual xj's without interference.
B004FFELTM|5|All my vehicles have these now
B000EOKQII|5|Perfect fit
B001C5KKBG|4|It does what it's supposed to, after I wore it for a while I started having to roll the top edge to make sure it stays tight. Other than that, perfect.
B0033WDFEK|5|very heavy duty, fit great in my 2012 F250 in my B&W goosneck
B0009H51MG|5|I always order these for the savings from Amazon.
B000C53X8Y|5|Perfect fit for a 1969 Road Runner. No problems at all with this purchase.
B0015PN010|5|works great
B00BD4SKY0|5|They worked perfectly for my Husbands car
B000S0H2A8|4|sound good
B00VZ547UI|5|Excellent. Good service. Easy to install!
B00NGTS158|5|Lights up really well underwater at night!
B0002MACJ0|1|Disappointed in this net.  It's too big for the basket it is listed for, unless you are really pilung stuff high on it.  I had a large tent, a jogging stroller, three camping chairs, three beach chairs, a cooler and a couple bags in it and I still had to hook this thing way underneath the basket.  Not a huge deal, bit would definitely be easier if it was a little smaller.  Also, two of the connections failed, so its probably a matter of time until they all do
B00496F0JC|1|Doesn't fit in Subaru Tribeca.
B00HAQBEH0|4|These are bright for their size, small and light weight, perfect for stashing in a glove box for those &#34;just in case&#34; situations, in a backpack pocket, etc. They do get a little warm during extended use.
B00SZ5GOXY|5|Absolutely perfect. I'm a repeat customer and look no further.
B001DCL3FA|5|These work very well, installation was fairly easy and they lift as well or better than the original equipment.
B00ODM4I90|5|Well made. Shipped as described and promised.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Super bright and pretty easy to install! They work just perfect!
B00EKPQI7A|5|Love it just what I wanted.
B00JBJ3K3U|5|The rubber piece on the inner part isnt as long as the stock lights. these look great on my 02 dodge 1500 makes it look way newer. They adjust same as stock too.
B00BITI6DA|5|Installed this in a 2000 Cadillac Escalade. It fit perfect and looks great.
B0002Z9KE0|5|Heavy.  The storage bad keeps things clean inside.
B0048A0FI0|3|This product was not what I expected. I eventually purchased a different brand.
B00W41E54U|5|cleaned and conditioned shoes and leather chair. works great!
B00AV1FZ2G|5|Used for my dome light in my ranger
B00V33YJE6|5|Amazing jacket, looks awesome stays nice and cool. Its a &#34;summer only&#34; jacket, as there is no insulation. Very good rain liner, only wish it was a  bit more adjustable in the waist. but overall a jacket well worth the price!
B00FEZKNYO|5|These plates are nicely styled, and add another touch of class to an already sexy car.  They arrived damage free, with all contents inside.  The front door sill guards fit perfect, and it comes with additional 3M two-sided tape as the ones on the plates may not be sufficient.  Make sure to use a heat source, i.e. blow dryer or heat gun for a more secure adhesion.  The rear plates fit, but they are a bit longer than the OEM plates from Mopar.  The issue with the rear plates is that the end points make contact where the door sill starts to curve.  This leaves the middle portion of the plates &#34;sort of floating&#34; above to contact surface, which will require a stronger seal to keep them in place.  I would suggest some clamps (plastic or rubber to preserve paint) to hold down the middle section while you heat the plates, and allow some time for a more secure contact to the sill.  Otherwise the 3M tape may not hold, causing the plate to pop up and become loose/ separate from the sill.  Outside of that issue, the plates look great, and for the price  these are an amazing addition to your chrysler
B0024E6AQ8|5|It protects our interior, lowers the inside temperature,plus provides a lot more privacy then a cheap curtain across the front seats.
B00DRYOOIA|5|Great smooth and handsome shock
B00D3298A0|5|Was looking for looks good and fits inside my truck. These are heavy duty mats that appear to be able to last for a long time. Fast processing and shipping. I did receive a discount and would recommend these mats for anyone looking to replace or upgrade
B00BYNJANU|5|Great smooth shock
B000IYSYO2|5|So far, this sensor has fixed my 07 Frontier truck!  There were two occasions the truck stalled out while I was driving.  Good thing was no accident.  I read the code, and it showed the CPS was malfunctioned.  I when to local part stores and got the wrong part. They only have the left-side sensor, and this one was the right-side. I actually ruined one from the store since the plug was backward, and I couldn't see since it was between the back of the engine and the firewall.<br /><br />I decided to order this one after comparing with the original part.  It has been two months, and there has been no issue.  Keep my fingers crossed!
B002XLHUQG|5|If you own an rv and want the shaking to stop buy this product. Even with stabilizer jacks and traditional chocks it still swayed. Not anymore with this product. However ready the other reviews and do not over tighten so you don't bust belts in your tires. It's a bit more expensive but well worth the price.
B003MOG7BC|1|This is not a review. This is a little 101 on spark plugs and technology behind them. I'm a real master technician please I don't want to sound my own horn, But the real truth about spark plugs go's like this. The basic cheap NGK brand v groove are the best plugs on the planet. You ask why? Simply put there not made of rare metals. They are just a copper center electrode. A much better conductor of the secondary ignition. Yes they might wear out faster, But the transmission of higher Kv is what a copper plug dose best. Just look at any race engine. Either 2 stroke or 4 stroke motors. In motorcycle boats or cars. Real Professional engine builders all use NKG as there first choice. Rare metal plugs such as platinum and other super hard metals have been added to spark plugs for longevity. That's it, nothing more. And the fun starts when a back yarder mechanic gets his grandfather's rusty feeler gauges out, and jams it in between the present air gap on a double platinum plug. Destroying the plug in the process. That's why they tell you not to mess with it. That tiny amount of platinum is fragile. And worse yet the fine wire type is even more delicate. My suggestion is whatever the manufacturer put in when your vehicle was made is what you should be replacing it with. But use the NGK brand. Not only will Your wallet thank you, but you.favorite form of transportation will.also. O yeah , one ending note  all this reinvention of the spark plug is just plain stupid. Like the use of sea foam to de-carbon Your upper cylinders especially engines with direct injection should be cleaned with just plain water trickling through the intake manifold. Either the vacuum servo brake booster hose or the hose on the pcv valve. That's what we been using in our shop for the last forever.
B006QH54WU|5|Quick and 100% satisfied
B003ZWHMGU|5|Good
B00WKS07WQ|2|I just bought a brand new 2015 Acura TLX and I wanted to keep my key remote from scratches so I ordered this. It would've been perfect if it fit correctly, LOL. It was sliding in and out a lot. I had to constantly adjust it and the alignment of the empty spaces for you to click/press your unlock, lock, trunk, etc. was not correct. I was very disappointed but I kept it on and tried to make it work until my dad borrowed my car one day and he took the cover off and said, \\"What the hell is this s***?\\" LOL :(
B005QZLA62|5|gotta love new coil springs to replace your 14 year old original
B000GKD5NI|2|Doesn't stick too well even on the first use
B00VDHJLWW|1|The strips which is holding , broke after three weeks I do not recommend it
B001F212OK|3|Bought this to put air in t eh suspension on my 1990 FLHTC. Works fine, although the gauge is oddly calibrated. The suspension doesn't need a lot of pressure (10 to 20 pounds or so), and at those levels, the gauge is barely off the pin.
B003TSQOE6|4|Shipped fast look nice
B009IK9P18|5|The best feature of the mirrors is that it is adjustable. I now feel safer when travelling on the highway.
B00JRE38EA|5|Nice.
B004I0HFQK|5|Perfect fit, no problems.
B007772I54|5|Prevents the rust stains on pool deck and fits perfect
B007GQQPU0|5|Really nice decals.
B00T1YADSU|5|Mounted two on front and two in the rear of my Jeep XJ, pretty bright,  good bang for the buck. Oncoming traffic is pretty irritated with them due to brightness, lol. Connected directly to the reverse lights and stock fog lamp circuits due to the low wattage required to run these leds. Pretty awesome!
B004J00GII|1|Don't believe the application chart.  This product is NOT for a 2015 Ultra Classic.  No opening for the air vent.
B005XRFEOC|5|Fits perfectly.
B002GRV0LS|5|Very Awesome!!  Great quality! Definitely worth buying more,
B00774U6HY|5|Good product. Easy installation. I would definitely buy this again!
B00EZBRKW6|5|$66.00 and compared to $200.00 and there is no difference.  Quality feels looks and fits the same.  Smile rating 5 out of 5 smiles.
B00KTIUG5C|5|I wasn't sure these would work since I bought the truck used and never received any.  The truck has  Power locks so I thought it was worth a try .  The price was right!  I received the products and they work great .
B000NJ97C0|5|Since I haven't tried these I gave them 5 stars. Folks complain about clothes at the bottom of their closet after driving. We log 15,000 miles plus each year and have never had that happen. We use the suede/velvet like hangers.
B00J0GV7OS|5|good price and fit
B00DNX94E4|4|good stuff
B0040CYWX0|5|Awesome deal......
B0013FWACW|2|one of 2 the ordered is damaged or used.
B00JGGJO1A|5|Fixs nice
B00GSAUHB8|4|I have a 2005 Toyota 4Runner it is a little too large for it. While it does work a little smaller would be better. I also like that it came with a storage pouch, but the pouch is a little too small and it is difficult to get it into the pouch also the pouch does not stay closed.
B00MEYYLZA|5|Easy install. Worls and looks great.
B000VXA7DG|2|The answer in th Q&A is incorrect, it does not fit the RF 1200. You need the one for the CWR-1 shield
B007EKQ99A|5|Love these springs, my SUV no longer sags in the rear anymore. Can beat the price compared to the dealer price and shipping was quick.
B002IV4XR0|5|This is the exact handle that is sold for $21.76 when linking into the Yamaha parts page from the local dealer where I got my boat here in Los Angeles.  See photos where the 1 damaged handle and 1 attachment point are laid side by side with the newly installed ones I got from Attwood here through Amazon. .  So for those that are worried about using this as replacement handle(s) on Yamaha Jet boats...don't be.  I have already seen posts about Yamaha AR2XX series boat owners getting this handle and it worked fine...because it is the same exact handle that Yamaha installs on their boats.
B004P5G2GM|1|Did not even fit in any of our three cars so I threw it away.
B005OYOMTW|5|works as intended, the auto function on my electric windows are confused at times but no biggy.

B00BFDGROO|5|Fast shipping and worked nicely
B00IK37BTW|4|Came in sooner then the eta given.  Was a straight bolt on. Time will tell on how long it will last.  For the price  I can buy another and still not even come  close to what they are asking for them a part stores.
B000SL4AA2|1|This thing is AWFUL! I read the reviews and people said it could be used on inflatables, well they are dead wrong. It is quicker to blow them up by hand than with this thing. Waste of money.
B00711PBZK|5|perfect fit and stopped my overheat problem. 2005 mazda mpv

B00P3IAYSC|5|I just completed my 42nd season of tournament bass fishing and have used Reese trailer-related products (and other, more expensive brands) on my rigs for as long as I can remember.  These retractable winch tie-downs were no exception to the good performance I have had with Reese brand devices.  I advise reading other reviews regarding the correct positioning of the lift handles after tightening the straps connecting your boat to the trailer.  The handles must be lifted slightly to engage the gear tooth preventing the ratchet mechanism from turning backwards and loosening the straps.  Excellent product at a savings of at least $20.00 versus the other guys (which is also an excellent unit).
B00VSB80E8|4|I spend a lot of time in my vehicle during the day taking kids back and forth to school and work. The sun is always shining in and I am sensitive to the sun and get headaches frequently from it, not to mention that it can get extremely hot in there with the sun shining in on me all the time. I have recently started getting sun shades for my vehicles for these reasons.<br /><br />This one in particular, I really like because firstly It has the American Flag on it, which I am always proud to display. This is also different from many of the newer types coming out that just stick to the window with sort of a static cling method. This one uses suction cups to attach to the window (which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) It does take a little more work to use this one. You have to get the suction cups in place and then attach this to the window. For me this can be a bit of a hassle at times. I do not have a working air conditioner in my vehicle so I have to roll my window down a lot, and having to put up and take down the suction cups constantly is a pain. It does come with spare suction cups so if one was to get lost there are extra's. I do like the design and It does block out the sun, For me these are better used in the back of the vehicle where nobody is rolling down windows. When we did attach these, they stayed in place quite well. The suction cups was not to hard to install but it did take a couple of tries to get them to stick. Over all this is a nice set, it just doesn't work out as well for me as I would hope. I will be using them in the back of my vehicle and using the self stick kind towards the front.<br /><br />** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review. My review is based solely on my experience and honest opinions with this product. I have nothing to gain by leaving a review this is simply my honest opinion **
B00QOYA2VI|5|Easy install and looks good on my machine. Nice and bright LED light
B00T85ANNW|5|Very nice feeler gauge, set my points perfectly in my corvette.  Has all the sizes I'll need,
B002GOFVS4|5|This is one AWESOME HD emblem! It is so cool, better than I expected. I really liked the bolts that came with it to secure it from theft.
B00JBI8RYS|5|First off don't let the professional installation suggested make you not order these. The installation is very simple and the lights are outstanding in both quality and looks. My vet is 10 years old and the plastic tab that the lights mount with on my original bulbs had become brittle and broke letting the lens fall out of the rear of the car. I decided to take a chance and order all 4 from here and I was not disappointed.
B0006I0MXG|5|Works just as it should
B00085F51G|5|Just right for adjusting the pressure in a reverse osmosis tank.
B00AYZB6Z4|3|Good bright light but the brackets are not as pictured ,not as thick and made different and the ends where you bolt the bracket strip easily , had to take off the ends and  drill out the holes and run a bolt from the inside out and put a nut on but now it's 10x stronger , also not fully water proof so I took the glass off and by the way it's not tempered glass like in the advertising it's just plexiglass , and sealed it with high temp silicone, also the paint sucks so I rustolium painted it then bed liner sprayed it , it's A+ now , if you don't mind spending lil time on reinforcing it then it's a great buy and super bright light , I'd rather have to doctor it a bit then pay $800 for the same rigid lol
B006ZVF9H2|5|They fit my Polaris helmet. I like the flip up finger tightening feature although the photo illustrates straight screws.
B00522PH36|5|Another reminder that with the Jeep brand you don't get what you pay for until you buy it after the vehicle sale.  There's a space for the cabin air filter but Jeep didn't provide this $30 part so you could have clean, fresh air.<br />Be careful with the cheap, thin plastic when installing.
B0085FP5WA|5|Fit and work nicely!
B0040CYWX0|4|nice and cheap
B00YF7Z0X6|5|worked fine
B00AUMJVE4|4|Guess what?  If it fits the 03 Accord it fits 98-02 Accord SEDAN (not coupe!!) and all the vehicles that share that lens.  There is only one slight issue.  The original light bulb socket will not fit against the new lens so you'll just have to let it dangle around in there.  The T10 adapter coming off the lens fits extremely tight, so there's absolutely no danger of wiring issues.  You will have to cope with paying some decent money to get two lenses when you only need one, but it's probably worth it in the long run.<br /><br />In other news, this thing is stupid bright.  A regular 5 SMD LED is much brighter than the stock bulb.  Possibly even brighter than a 2825, but I never tested that solution.  In any event, you generally only get one SMD actually aimed at the plate.  This has 18 SMDs aimed at the plate.  This is the kind of light output that reaches your bumper and lights it up, too.
B000EZVXCK|5|Ok Product
B00Z89I2OY|5|Second set, nuff said
B00GNKI2NS|3|they dont work with a thumb throttle
B00KLKZS0G|3|Not for rush hour heavy stop n go traffic in three or four months ive had to resurface them twice ..... cheep steel maybe.
B002GZRLEU|2|These are 3/8 like all the Kinetec and properly fit only Kinetec power cells (batteries).<br />They also add to the height of the Battery.  It would be much more accurate information if they were shown in place on a cut away drawing.<br />It's been a while but if the company uses a decent CAD_CAM system it would produce the cut away from the design drawings.<br />These are pretty crude so Kinetik may still be in the stone age.
B000IXPQ3A|5|I really loved this Superman keychain!!
B00VQTLGMK|2|Easy and quick transaction. Easy to install but tow hook shaft is extremely long and sticks out way to much. 2006 gs300.... Disappointed.
B00FE1BUAE|5|This is to replace the original one I had that was ripped off my car.
B00QGPKCJ2|4|Fits well but doesn't cover all the carpet under the back seat.
B001AGKXEQ|5|Have this installed on 2015 Tundra with 2.5&#34; pipes and 4&#34; tips....sounds great!
B000IOJ496|5|OEM fit. Easy install. Very pleased.
B00BH0JVF2|5|Work great!
B000BNZPT2|5|Great replacement for a truck with no lock on the tailgate. Installs in minutes and keeps items locked up under the cap. It also prevents thieves from stealing your tailgate. Very happy.
B00Z0F9XCG|5|I'm obligated to disclose that I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.<br /><br />I bought these to install on my Audi, and they worked great. Now I need to find more LED bulbs to complete the look!<br />These LED's are significantly brighter than the OEM incandescent bulbs which were in my car, and they give a nice bright white light, versus that nasty dull yellow. It really does provide a nice new-age look versus the old-school incandescent bulbs.<br />Just be aware that these festoon bulbs do have a sizable heat sink. While this is a good thing to have on an LED bulb, this may affect the ability to install them in place of your OEM bulbs due to size constraints. I had no issues with my car, but your mileage may vary.
B000K1YPLO|5|Works great on tourpack
B00XBUK19Q|4|Great quality stickers included 1 that was inappropriate but other than that great cheap stickers!
B001AY2WLU|5|:)
B0027UO7PU|5|Did a little research and found that the fair lead mounts had to be modified. This product fit my 2013 honda rancher 420 sa with just that minor modification with ease. The provided instructions were easy to follow and made for a quick install. In all a great product.
B000C9QDNC|5|good price for a nice filter. no issues installing.  recommend it.
B0081ZYY6W|5|This set of JEGS bits cut through steel like butter. I really enjoy using them because they cut fast.
B00AC6VC1I|5|Surprisingly extremely simple to install only thing you will need is a drill and a drillbit to secure the lift kit from moving to your swingarm and a ranch and a ratchet I have had this on my ATV for quite some  time now and it has not bented or moved if your looking for about a 1in lift this is<br />For you
B00NS1IA78|5|Love this fender eliminator. I really like how the blinkers sit higher on this than on most other ones. And i like how you can use the original lights/blinkers, or change them if you want. The instructions are pretty good too.
B000X1YUZC|2|advertised as 900 pound, actual rated capacity is 300 pounds. READ full description completely you can buy same or better cheaper.
B00GBQ3YXM|5|Thumbs up , a great product and I do recommend ! This is a must when hauling an RV or a car hauler trailer it helps control ability greatly. I install units like this every day at an RV dealership that I work at . Don't gamble with safety and comfort (install one and see for yourself!) .
B0024E6V30|5|water tast real good
B00JUARWTI|5|Item was perfect fit and just what was needed. Fast shipping and great service. If I ever need another - I will come back!
B00TO2WEH2|5|the cutest steering wheel cover - it fit great and looks fabulous!
B011PCVM58|2|Cool looking, low functionality, although they advertised that their snaps have been upgraded, you will still go through 2 every season, make the smart choice, look for a Fulmer brand, My Fulmer visor lasted for years.
B000PKZ3IY|5|Good stuff  professional quality in a rattle can arrived on time
B00JIUKU62|5|Best price I could find.  Product was as advertised.  I would purchase again.
B00I4CLY6A|5|Just what I needed for my vinyl wrap.
B00D2M36YA|3|Fit well for aftermarket. Price is great as compared to OEM part of nearly $200! However, quality of rubber is sub-OEM quality and will not last 200,000 miles as the factory Lexus couplers did. One of these blew apart in just a few thousand miles but driveshaft was under a lot of stress from bad U-Joint and i did pound down on the accelerator to show a 2 year old Mustang I can keep up with a smaller but far superior engine! Lol! I have 217k on my Lexus, dont think Mustangs Odometers have a 2 in the hundredths column.
B00IZAJ2YW|5|Nice
B0002JN2EU|5|I'm biased towards all fuel additives being snake oil except for diesel injector cleaner and biocide a few times a year.<br /><br /> That being said, I tried this on recommendation of a motorcycle mechanic I respected who acknowledged my &#34;slick50&#34; concerns and said this seemed to smooth out motors to him.<br /><br />I first ran my 2005 zx10r hard to get it warmed up and try to tell if there was any difference. I added a few ounces to the half full tank and started out again. 10 miles later when I was moving slow in town and stopped, it appeared smoother and idled better. Where I really noticed was under deceleration using the gears to help slow the bike. Nice and smooth there.<br /><br />I know this bike well, the way it handles and feels. And it really seems as though seafoam works to me even though I have a negative bias.
B00BTK5W3U|3|Not as bright as the ones I took out
B009NI4G1E|5|Great product! Heavy duty. I had to figure out how to install it.
B00EQ2DDZ2|5|Great helmet for the money! Lots of air flow!
B00GHT6SF4|5|Fit in an 2003 GMC Sierra perfectly. The quality is very good, Good price too.
B004FXMGLY|5|After reading a lot of reviews where people have put these on an FJR  I put a set on my 2013 FJR  I could not be happier sounds great and fits like it should be original equipment . I suggest they drop the PIAA label and label them FJR horns .<br />Larry<br />8/29/2015
B000U0Z2L2|5|very good
B000EVYGZA|4|I ordered this unit for its size and flexibility for a number of use cases in both DC and AC applications.  However, I was planning to use this mostly for testing the DC voltage.  I like the size and the flexibility of this unit.  Also, the elastic band around the back allows me to have attached to my wrist for easier reading.<br /><br />I gave it four stars only because there's no easy access for replacing or recharging the battery.  it takes two AA batteries in the back, but you have to unscrew the entire back panel to access the batteries which is not a big deal, but they could have come up with a better design.  However, the price is very reasonable and makes up for this.
B00857CM8S|5|Came on time, great instructions, will update if sticker falls off
B00KWNSE6M|5|I like it.........
B001CI7KZC|5|Look nice
B00XZ9N6I6|3|It is kind of a tight fit, had to shave some green chip board material to make it fit. After that, I got it to wedge in there, and the buttons are off, as if not sized right for my original 09' cobalt keyless. Ultimately I got it to work, and now have no more problems. So it got a well deserved 3 stars. Not the greatest, but not the worst. Literally my title would be my reaction to the question of like or dislike. If I loved it I would talk about how great, if I hated it I would talk about how bad, but if it's just kinda in the middle then I go back to eating my chips
B000H3S4DK|5|IN MY  PACEMAN  2014  LOOK  COOL LOTS  OF  COMPLEMENTS  GREAT  PRICE  GREAT  SELLER /..
B00ADLHN3S|4|I ordered two rigid spouts, a couple spare seals, a 5 liter, 10liter, and two of the 20 liter cans and received them in just a few days. The cans themselves are just fantastic, very sturdy and should last a lifetime. The spouts are the same, very well made and fit with minimal effort. The only gripe I have is that when I got them out of the box all 4 cans were fairly well dinged up and scuffed from shipping and handling.  I didn't think it was worth another $28 sending back and paying shipping again so I'll just keep them, they will get beat up anyways over time but it's always a bummer when you buy something new.
B00FV1MNIU|5|works great!
B0002KKTFO|5|High quality product that works as it should.
B0030M0WQM|5|Does exactly what is says it will, good product.
B001P4EMTK|5|Great price on a top of the line American made filter.
B001PBQ07A|5|This is an auto tow strap to keep in your trunk and has many other uses around the home or farm. Very strong and good price.
B005DM0OC4|5|Very nice easy to install
B011B25IXY|5|Well made and does not scratch the painted surfaces.  Will buy again.
B0009IQXXG|4|Easy to apply and looks good
B00A15X2B8|5|Works great !!!
B008S9QUGI|5|Fits perfect
B001QFBV9M|5|They are very good and strong.
B000BM8RT8|1|I bought this compressor to inflate my tires when we come off the beach.  I tested it in my drive way by re inflating my tires. During inflation of the second tire the unit died.  Granted I'm inflating large tire on a Ford F-250 but this should have done the job
B00ISJX67E|5|Perfect fit at a fantastic price. Great product.
B00KTIF652|1|I purchased this set of keyless remotes early this week. I was super excited when I received them yesterday, however, that quickly changed to disappointment when neither remote worked upon attempting to program them.  I watched numerous of programming videos so I know I was doing correctly. I immediately notified the company and I am now currently waiting for their response.  Extremely disappointed with this product!!!!!!
B00M8TB5C8|5|Great quality and looks just like the picture
B00CPN0BB8|4|Nice matte carbon fiber look, but doesent stick to well when heated.
B00BDEP9S0|4|I wish the plastic was stronger.  It feels weak but gets the job done. I'm waiting for a job when I need to use it on a 3&#34; cleanout
B00ESMSOOU|5|No need to run to the local gas station, with quarters, and pay for air. I keep it in my trunk ( - we have a DC outlet in trunk - many newer vehicles do). Every 2-3 days, I plug it in and check pressure and add in a quick minute. The built-in gauge is spot-on accurate with my digital gauge.<br />It is a bit noisy, but it is compact. Light is nice add-on feature when you need it.<br />Been using regularly for about a month and I might buy another to keep at work, in case I am a hurry and miss my morning pre-ride air check!
B00SWM3BX6|5|works as discribed
B006YHQ7T6|4|As others reviewed, the heavy gauge steel is much more solid than it appears. It was heavy! Which is good. But it is more of a nerf bar and not a true rock slider. It mounts with 4 brackets underneath, but not to the frame, to the body.  Still more solid than most need bars, which genteel have 2 bracket points. The installation instructions kind of suck. So you have to figure it out, but it's not rocket science. Just measure the hole setup first, to determine which is the left and right side.<br />One thing that is annoying is that you have to buy the rubber foot pads separately and they are $90. Then when you buy them they come with cheap screws, even though the holes on the steps are pre tapped for stainless steel quality screws, I think 10-32. So I replace them with stainless steel and it works great.
B00RJAOJS8|5|Item received was as pictured and the parts fit perfectly. Local RV dealers kept telling me that my step assembly was obsolete and needed to be replaced. (obviously more money for them). Step now works perfectly.<br />Thank You.<br />Peter
B00CFALFXY|5|Been using these for several months now. Very thick and sturdy, they absorb a lot of water but also wring out very well so that I can clean a surface without leaving a wet mess behind. They wash up great, I just air dry them.
B002XL2IG8|5|Great price on this cord.
B00P82P8AM|5|Bought if to protect the intercooler and keep leaves and other large gunk out of my engine bay. Fit and finish is 1st rate and install took me about 1 hour (and 2 beers). The gloss black matches the grill for a stock look. Excellent product and a fantastic addition to the car.
B007RXBTI0|5|We used to put under our portable air conditioner to protect the floor.
B002Z5VIS6|3|These are decent. I bought a set locally because I could never figure out what size I needed, and based on some of the other reviews and questions posted for this item I think others had the same issue. I have taken a picture of the box that shows the suggested product for various tire sizes and posted it; I hope it helps other folks shopping in the future.
B009R88HSS|5|Was a great compliment to my car.
B001L9ZGS0|5|Thought it was going to be a little bigger but it suits my needs
B009PV5CCG|5|Very satisfied with this product , I didn't know Amazon carried automotive parts but from now on I will check Amazon first for what I need .
B001C99T3W|3|Seems to be good quality material. Contrary to some reviews I've read on at different places this pump is not identical to the OEM pump. The impeller is different and the weep hole for the seal is in a poorly designed location. It will get road grime in the cavity and when the seal does start leaking the fluid cannot completely drain away as the weep hole is on the side about halfway up the cavity. The OEM pump weep hole is on the bottom of the cavity. Engine seems to be happy with it and cooling temperatures are normal.
B000Z0HVHA|5|perfect for what i am using it for
B00EC2CG9U|5|Very happy to be able to buy a whole pack of just the size I wanted.
B00CIMBB92|5|Sturdy,look good. The only way to secure your investment.
B005X40FSU|4|Very good and interesting
B00I7ELD02|5|This filter fit right in and is excellent for keeping the cabin area clean and nice smelling.
B002P8KPL4|5|Yes, it got here on time and matched perfectly to my vehicle. It looks just like the stock mirror that was there originally. I'm very pleased with your product!
B005GSK0VU|3|fast deliver and good product
B00BEZKGM2|5|I got it, what more do you want
B001UGNJ60|5|Used this on one of the front landing gear on a 5th wheel. Made a big difference.
B00861FQU4|5|Noticed a huge improvement on my 2010 Nissan Titan. Also had Flowmaster exhaust installed and Superchip Cortex. Definitely gained more power on the low end. My truck jumps now when you punch the gas.
B00FSHMZ3A|5|Nice fit.
B00VJ3J66G|5|Although this rear bumper hasn't been installed as yet, I expect it will be what I expected.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very Bright
B00IM9A3BC|5|Love this helmet. Great fit!!
B005JU5ZKG|5|Excellent product; really easy to install and great when it rains here in tropical Costa Rica
B00MQ5Z5F2|2|Melted the positive side cable first time is used it.
B009DIYQ4Q|1|Said it fits my vehicle  and it not even  close
B006LLAXJK|5|perfect fit for my sister's 95 honda civic Ex coupe v tech I4. Dipstick feels well made too
B00MUFTH2A|5|Super cute. Our grandchildren love Totoro. Quality is excellent.
B000F0WZH6|1|It is to thin and seems to be of low grade material. I ordered another brand and it was heavier material.
B000AP1MSE|5|Fit perfect and working well
B00429NKWK|5|Holy crap totally worth the money! I was going to spend 650 per headlight before this and saved 1000 dollars literally.  Awesome product, my only tip is wet sand with the 400 2x for 5min as well as all the other sand papers.  Thank you!
B003E1O9ZE|5|Works great.
B00W975RPA|4|Nice product and they work well for what they are intended for, shipping was slow but not all that slow considering they shipped from Japan (I didn't notice where they were shipping from when I ordered them) not a big deal. They were very inexpensive but appear to be of high quality.
B000CODGXW|5|sturdy and reliable  as well as lightweight (compared to a chain).  great bargain for the price
B00P1H9LDE|5|Excellent product..  Match perfectly.  Everything you need in one bottle.
B000WK4I5G|5|As described better and cheaper than stealer ship had.
B002OJ9Y98|5|Bought this so we could move our break controller between vehicles. Works great.
B000E2CVI8|5|I use this on my 2006 Kawasaki Mean Streak 1600, but have used other K&N oil filters on multiple other vehicles I've owned.  The selling point for me is the hex nut brazed on the end of the filter, and I'm simply baffled why nobody else does this.  It makes removal of tightly located filters a snap.  Fram's textured filter surface is the second best thing, but they aren't readily available for many non-car vehicles (e.g. motorcycles, ATVs).
B001KOL66C|5|Great product on time delivery
B006JD481Y|5|Programed easy a has yet to give me any issues yet! I think it's  great product at a great price!
B002OVI9JC|5|This stuff is awesome.
B005A8MNFC|5|Works great!
B0002NIJT4|3|Looked good when I pulled the first set out of the box. Then pulled the second set out and one says GMC on it. Don't know how that could have happened but now have to send it back or buy two more.
B007RYMT7O|4|Works great. Still some banging when flushing, but a big improvement.
B00BLPQ58E|5|Comfortable and a good piece of mind to ride with
B000CKDPF0|1|Wrong part. Again.
B0009PCPNQ|5|I have never cleaned my car seats before and I've had my car about 2 years. This product turned my seats into basically brand new in about 30 mins (mostly me taking my time). This product got the dirt right out and is so easy to use.
B00CT9M062|5|Great product A+++
B0004ELKC4|2|This isn't as good as I hoped it would be.  I can't tell that it protects like it says it does.  I works okay to get the dust off my dash and that's about it.  I don't recommend this product.
B004HAAPRC|5|Fast shipping and great product
B00KWMNI6Y|2|They have gotten very dirty during normal use. Tried washing out the grime with soap and water with not much success. I'm retired so this grime is just normal wear in and out of my vehicle. I've only used them for one month or so
B00LBACAMY|5|Very nice, easy install,  keeps u cool
B00G4YUWMC|5|Great product for a great price
B000E2ARGG|5|Came in fast and fit my 2004 trx400ex
B00NQ8WZ0G|5|Great seller,the bungee cord was the correct size needed. The cord arrived at the expected time. I may have to order several more,this size in the near future. I like the fact that it can be adjusted,to fit the length needed.
B008G4Y076|5|The bulbs themselves are excellent; very bright and &#34;white&#34;, and do an excellent job of illuminating the area behind the vehicle when backing at night.  The hardest part was getting to the bulb housing on my 2010 Nissan Altima, a vehicle widely known for having difficult-to-replace exterior bulbs.
B00JEP8PAE|5|Makes my rims stands out.
B00MVN6TS6|5|A good switch for what I used it for, which was two led fog lights for my car. Note, when the switch is on, it's lights up white, not blue. It's &#34;blue-colored&#34; but the light is white. It does get quite warm for what I'm using it for, but it still does the job with no problem.  Anyways I care less on that and it's not bright at night to mess with your vision. For the price, it's good for me. Thanks!
B00M32816I|5|It took two years, but I've finally won over my better half-- she's now a fan of my retirement vehicle, a 2013 Raptor. Until I installed the AMP Research Power Step, it was a real chore for her to get in and out of the truck because it sits so high. Now when she opens the door, the step drops down to a comfortable level for her and she can easily step up into the cab. It even lights up so she can see it at night. The mechanical part of the installation was straight forward and the electrical part was simple with the plug and play design. An added bonus: my MPG has improved, probably due to the sleeker form without the OEM wing-like running boards. Thanks AMP Research ... my wife and I both enjoy the retirement truck now.
B006TMPMKG|5|excellent
B00C5SWAIU|4|This product is great if your husband has patience to install.  It will take you more then 5 minutes.  Otherwise a great product
B0009NWQWI|5|This is a fantastic product. It almost double the trunk space of my Porsche Macan SUV. Drove 300 miles at turnpike speed with absolutely no problem.  I put the loaded bag on a stool behind the car before strapping it down, which made the process very easy as I didn't have to lift the weight.  We didn't have a roof rack so I use the clips to attach to the top of the hatchback. No damage to paint whatsoever.
B005GYDBNS|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B005WXDPHK|1|Do not buy this product. It is NOT waterproof or water resistant. My car got soaking wet and it was not even directly exposed to the rain. This product will not protect your car from water. I am returning it.
B008G32B1O|2|The factory hardware to mount the lights is flimsy. After installing the headlamps they were lose. I did not want to return them since I am already into the install.  Like others, I had to remove the flimsy mounting hardware and use my old mounting hardware for the headlights..No happy to have to do that.  I wouldn't buy these again......  Thumbs down...
B001AIZ5HY|5|2004 325i with trashed headlights. Allow 30-40 to complete the job. Mask well with blue tape. Product is amazing. Lenses look like new.
B0033WNJBO|3|This hitch bolts up ok but the receiver opening is tucked 7 inches under the bumper requiring a long extension on the ball carrier.<br />This is a 2014 Subaru outback. There is probably one that fits better. It is a very sturdy hitch.
B00C6JUSHI|5|Makes my car look less of a r/c car. Only very rarely does it get out performed by the oem one.<br /><br />Safe for car wash. I only found out because I forgot to take it off
B000CN56OA|1|Advertised as a fit for my 1999 Honda Civic but didn't match my needs at all. I ended up removing my sway bar until I can find suitable replacements.
B011VNB75Q|4|The handybar has notches so does not fit tight and wiggles a little.  My husband has no trouble using it.
B000BZI4JS|2|Had to send back ,wrong type.
B003V9TC10|1|I put these on my tires and tightened them with pliers to ensure a good seal. The next morning I had 2 flat tires. A real waste of money!
B00SI7SX6A|5|Perfect. No need for a long review.
B00E59LDK8|4|Great quality, bends match the original. Had to use some emery cloth on the quick connect end until it would go in all the way.
B000NA47QK|5|New look makes the lights look good.
B002J8379C|5|I really do love these applicators...I often buy them as I wax my cars fairly regularly and I do not want any impregnated dirt when I reapply a new coat of wax...not wanted to scratch the paint! Theses are great, inexpensive, and resilient applicators!
B00I1PFD4Y|5|These made my life so much easier when installing my component speakers.  Very little effort or skill required..
B000C9IPGU|3|appeared to be a nice clean replacement part but didn't fit my vehicle.  item heading stated it was &#34;driver side&#34; but passenger side motor was sent.  returned for refund and purchased another which turned out to be half the price of this model.
B00CM589B8|4|Cut it in two pieces because it was too big.
B0088LMVMI|5|Just like the dealer.
B00OZ9TU30|5|I got lots of compliments on my decal, I love it. It's different and somewhat hipster-ish. I didn't want just any decal since I have a newer car and don't want to destroy it with stickers, so I was choosy and found this one and it is perfect, as I love to go on adventures!
B00MX3MP5A|2|Okay doesn't fit perfectly looks nicer in picture
B00QJWUPC6|5|It is as though I put a whole different set of headlights on my vehicle.
B001650QPC|3|Fits 1&#34; tube, and I installed it easily on 3/4&#34; or 7/8&#34; tube with a small piece of rubber hose inside the clamp.  The mounts are cast pretty rough and they do not feel like they have the best craftsmanship.  Even with the rubber in the clamp and the rubber on the peg, they still allow what feels like an excessive amount of vibration to travel to the feet resting on them.
B00CPL926K|5|Great motor oil.  I could feel a significant difference in the way my car drove.  It felt much lighter, and quieter.
B004R344DA|4|Was generally happy until I seen &#34;Made in China&#34;. Fooled me as was searching to buy and I saw the bull dog emblem I was thinking about trailer jacks in the past that were by bull dog and made in USA!!!
B0056DWNRO|5|This product is very nice and the service too.
B00TVROQYE|5|Order arrived way early then expected date ! Also love love love the decal !
B000VS8DZU|1|Fast shipping...... Just not happy with product Cracked a day after use..
B00WW4WXRA|5|i have been through about 6 different wheel covers and this is the best one i found grips nice and very comfortable on my hands
B000EQR5YE|5|This fixed the problem on my 2000 Silverado 4x4 with suddenly not having any dash lights. Took about 5 minutes to fix.
B00NUEG8MC|1|Advertised to fit 1993 Grand Cherokee<br />It does not fit. Very unhappy.
B004SCETXU|5|Excellent transaction, good item
B00474OHCW|5|Fits 6th Gen (98-02) Accord Sedan (and probably coupe).  Looks awesome what with its form fitting shape and all. Looks much bigger than the boring rectangular 6th gen reservoir.  Capacity may or may not be the same.  Who cares?  This is totally rice and surely gives me another 2HP.  Ok, not really.  But at least I won't be having coolant leak out the plastic seam anymore.<br /><br />Unlike photo, cap is yellow.  Does not include the hose to connect to the radiator.
B00029ND1M|5|A good deal. Nothing too fancy. But just what I needed. And a very fair price.
B00GLLW3AM|4|Works great and lights up well, and bright. Giving 4 Stas just because the light are not adjustable other than that does the job as described.
B006QXJ27M|5|Awesome. Held down my Harley Davidson 2,500 miles without a problem.
B001AIZ5HY|4|Hey this worked for me.  Follow the directions and get some masking tape.  Take it easy and steady, you will be done in a half hour to 45 minutes for a pair of headlights.  Works well!  Then get some protectant for the headlights and keep an eye on it over time.
B00FEIWSBW|5|Great idea not to have to worry about going to the garage and having the frame scratched or fender / rocker panel's damaged.
B005ETQ650|5|OEM quality used by dealership.
B00400H08G|5|I ended up purchasing this through a different website after two failed attempts through Amazon-both shipments from Amazon were missing the blue filter.  Reason for 5 stars?  One of THE best CAI for the 2010 Chevy Camaro v-6 out there!  Increased power, torque and fuel economy.
B00I8SJ548|5|Installed them on my 07 Busa and they sound great!  I took the baffles out and to me it gives off a better growl. I do suggest getting a power commander and tune. If you can't do that see if you get get a tune straight to the computer. It will help on gas consumption as your bike will run rich once the pipes are on.
B002ZTGLDY|5|Great product..just ordered wrong size.
B00ANA3UTK|5|This stuff cleans anything!
B004YJTD8S|5|These made the stance of my truck perfect. The ride quality is excellent and if recommend for any truck, four wheel drive or two.
B005PZMKZI|5|The seat covers arrived on time and were in the condition as promised. However, the only flaw was that the headrest covers were too big for my 2006 Cobalt seats.
B00DB8FMIS|1|Had to return it because the sides where needed . It doesn't tell you that when you purchase it.
B000EVYGZA|5|Innova has great customer service!
B00GDR5O28|5|works perfect on my 2007 cr250
B008Y9KE7S|4|good but didn't come with any screws, so you better have the old ones (not like me) or have to take a trip to Home-depot!
B000PL2D18|5|worked fine
B003P6FAOW|5|Fits my Ram very well.  I was even able to reinstall my soft  tonneau cover on top of the brackets.  Color is closer to silver than clear over bright aluminum.  Very satisfied.
B00JIUQF0C|5|The nut looks great much better than the picture arrived on time
B0002SQYTG|1|Garbage...felt apart shortly after minimal use.
B00E6TXW6U|3|It a ok product.  I bought it because seeing it advertised on car show.  Not sure it I like it or not, but I only tried it out once.
B009DJPWK2|5|Fit perfectly with a price point way below the loc autobody. You can't tell it was replaced which is exactly what you want from a product like this.
B00WY7JH4W|5|Great product
B00LJ3BYRK|5|AAA+++ just as ordered!
B00AVA2DJA|5|Outstanding Fuel containers.
B00SA25KWI|4|still on my car by some miracle...
B0000UUX7A|5|Perfect fit and high quality
B000W0RQ8C|5|Seems very secure & solid.
B0007M1ALO|5|Best flaps out there!!
B00KMYYQ5O|4|Works great on Sunbrella fabric, but does not go near as far as the bottle states.  I started with the smaller spray bottle and had to buy more.  Purchased this 1 gallon to finish the job, plus now have extra for re-coating in a future year.  The spray bottle seemed a bit weak and kills your hands on a big project.  The tip of using a foam brush worked better.  The handle came off quickly though, so I basically just loose sponged it on.  I will use the same method next time.  It was a perfect solution for Sunbrella fabric on a boat flybridge cover.  I used dawn dishwashing liquid and 25% bleach solution with water to try to remove mildew first.  Some bad mildew spots required 100% bleach and a brush with heavy scrubbing.  Full bleach did not change the color of blue Sunbrella fabric.  Amazing.  Once nice and clean, I applied the 303 fabric guard.
B0002YUQ4E|5|James Avery recommended this polish to me. It works really well. I am amazed how well it cleaned my tarnished silver.
B000C543B0|4|2004 Chevy Avalanche. Just wandering how long the foam washer will last.
B00BGQ44Q8|5|It went on great, back window of my wife car.  Used the trick of dish soap and water in a spray made application much easier.  Thanks again
B0031HUVDA|5|great value
B00H1ES6S6|5|good price and product.
B0006I0NSK|5|Great deal exactly what I needed
B0087ZTEBG|1|Ordered one with 12 VDC coil and received one with 24 volt coil. I'll give them 1 star because it does work correctly and is a quality product (if you want 24 volt) .
B00U6Y0PWS|5|looks like crystal...great buy
B003UT3S6Q|2|I didn't see any noticeable difference in my wheels and they were pretty dirty to begin with.
B004ME11FS|5|does the job intended
B000LG0E36|5|Looks like factory original and works like it too
B000C59Z9A|5|Good product. Fit perfectly.
B00QVLQHAO|5|The shut off feature is great, especially when your distracted by something else at the time. Also, it does pump from a lower level.
B00YIOJ6ZY|5|great product.. fits and work perfect
B00546A92E|5|Fits great. Nice and tight.
B00KJGPN5W|4|Easy to use
B00WH1ZC80|5|easy to put in, easy to use
B00LDNH3EE|5|Very good product
B000CNBFD6|2|This cover is ok but not anything I would buy again. I originally had trouble with the center cross rail fitting from the start and ended up having to cut the original to fit the frame (Extang did send me a new rear cross rail for this position but was shorter than needed). The other issue I have is that when driving the cover sags considerably between the back 2 cross members though the top seems taught when standing still. I had a snap on cover on my previous truck with only 1 cross rail instead of 3 and no issues for 15 years, all about the quality.
B00KTJ8D38|1|Not a good deal. You have to take it to a dealer to have them programmed. That cost another $60 & my time doing it.
B00ELASYIA|5|Product arrived on time and was well packaged. The included storage bag is a nice touch as are the gloves. My spouse wanted a set for her new car and she was  very happy with the product - half the battle in any situation. Hopefully, we won't have to use these, but they appear more than capable of doing the job.
B00EAM6JKO|5|Nice but a bit too long
B000EDSSG6|1|Waste of money does ABSOLUTELY NOHING to lubricate valves been using it for two months straight of full time use and valves still sticking.
B00C8A2WZG|5|Product is as described I am satisfied with price and product
B00H7PQ50U|5|Bet wax out there! Works so well I can go 6 months without water spots. Also works wonders in the house. Took the rings off my electric stove top  and I don't have to squeegee my shower door anymore! I highly recommend getting the bundle from costco!
B009GOV4O2|4|good
B000HM5JP2|1|Absolute crap. It is so thin that it is translucent in certain areas. Plus it has a few holes in it. Also there is no way that it is 5-1/2 sq.ft. large . Last but not least on the manufactures  website it says it is made in New Zealand but the one I got is made in Turkey! Junk , save your money for another brand
B00LM1KPU6|5|I was VERY skeptical about purchasing no name could off Amazon.. But at half the price of an OEM set for my Skyline I thought I'd try them out. Have put well over 10,000km on my car since install and not a single problem yet. Well worth it in my opinion.
B0026A5AIE|5|This is probably the best dash light on the market dollar for dollar and easily in the top 1% of all the expensive ones. Nice large footprint about a foot long which is 3-4 inches longer than the other lights I've seen. It has lots of good patterns and very good brightness. This is as bright as my Whelen Liberty light bar in the day time when viewed head on. Naturally it's not as bright off axis but still good. I was very impressed especially since it's only $83 shipped! Build quality looks to be very good and the suction cups seem to work well. Had no problem mounting and adjusting it. Only had it a day so can't speak to long term reliability but hopefully it'll last plenty long. I can't imagine the higher dollar lights being any better especially considering their smaller footprint. This light is hard to beat.
B0049W0NVQ|5|Fit in my 2011 ranger 400.
B0028JLO3I|4|A good addition to our lives as our car is big and wide and our teenager is young and small.
B00DJDYN80|5|This product along with the sealer is the best I've ever used it sealed a minor leak in the AC system & seems to get a lot colder then the products used before.
B004A5700E|5|This was exactly what I needed for my 1978 2500 Chevy Van. My old vent window latches were getting loose and not holding the windows shut anymore and then I bought these ones. They lock right into place and hold the windows perfectly.
B0095D34YM|5|good fit
B000C3XDB8|1|I have used these filters twice and both times they started leaking at the seal a month or so after putting them on
B003YKYFBS|5|Fit great! I love EGR products!
B00VNBEBCS|5|WOW1 Alot more light than I had expected but that is safe and better lighting is always a good thing.Very impressed with this product-easy to install and easy to handle-Instructions are easy also. Join the club-for this is the future of light for your Car,Truck,boat,Motorcycle etc. Thank you Opt-7
B00MQ9BE3A|5|Very cool! My Nanny had Alzheimers and this is a good way to show your support for ending this awful disease

B008DX7KGS|4|Excellent!
B00NB808P0|4|A bit hard to use
B003E5X4I8|5|Short, Compact Muffler! Worked great on my side X side!
B000RFNKLY|1|junk fell apart first time using
B00D1CQVIY|5|Worked perfect had plenty of wire. Has 2 of each power & ground so able to hook up 2 lightbars. & the button lights up so if you run it on the road at night you won't forget it's on cause the bright ass red light
B00OEXYU14|5|Very good
B004JKEWZG|1|This only attaches to the steer tube with a single allen bolt.  It's way too much to ask that this one bolt deal with holding the forks on and steering the bike.  It's especially weak when fully extended.  This increases the amount of force you're applying at the handlebar grips.  After a day of riding I had to adjust and tighten 3 times I decided to buy one of the fixed height extensions.
B00I5UOYBS|5|Just what he needed.
B0010G0G9S|5|work very good, the rigth part gor my truck
B001BFPYGI|5|Perfect
B00VOLKGHG|4|It's white not black

B00OJN8E5C|4|Blue is very dark
B004AIDK50|1|my driver side air vents still blew hot air instead of the cold air I wanted it to when I bought this
B002YKGLUW|5|Thanks for the quick delivery, great price and fine product.
B00I7V33GC|5|The excellent koni products you'd expect
B000T9YKAS|5|Excellent
B004HLWPO2|4|Good fit and no problems with it. Works great as a replacement
B00VJ3YR06|5|My original bumper had gotten rusty from being 13 years old. My truck is in great shape for 13 years old otherwise.<br />I placed this bumper on the truck and it looks exactly like original. While it came with the mounting brackets i didnt use them and the bumper bolted up directly and easily to the original brackets. it Looks AWESOME<br />Thank you
B00IKIXTB6|1|They didn't fit my vehicle even though it said it did. It was pointless to send back because I would still be losing money so I had to trash them. I don't leave negative comments almost ever .
B0039T0518|5|As advertised, great!
