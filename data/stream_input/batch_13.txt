B006M4F67A|3|I like this game! The graphics are superb and the sounds are so cute, but can be turned off if you like. You have many choices of configurations and levels of play. You can pause and start over.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Couldn't put it down! Loves the converging stories and the epilogue is wonderful! Highly recommend to anyone needing a good easy read.

B008P1EWIM|5|I m very happy to have this , so thank you to all involved ... I would also say that I don't think there's one improvement I would make on it.
B002UM5BXW|5|Great read!  Very interesting to read what goes on behind the scenes in your favourite restaurant.
B009HEMJCW|5|Good old fashioned \\"Once Upon A Time\\" movie. The acting was perfect, the story line was great and the ending was a true love story.
B001XUPD94|5|I watched this movie with my 12 year old son. I got him hooked on the original series, and we have watched all the movies in chronological order. It's great to share something from your childhood with your children. I have watched the episodes a hundred times, but to watch one of them again, with someone who has never seen it before, is &#34;PRICELESS&#34;... I recommend this movie and all the previous ones as well. (Not to mention the original TV series) So sit back and watch these with your children. You will see them become fans and learn something in the process......
B00AEFYCL4|5|This is a wonderful movie that I wanted to own.  The price was great, it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B004QX07G4|4|Ellen has the kind of clever wit that elevates her observations of people and life to the level of Mark Twain's humor, which in my opinion is usually beyond comparison. She has the ability to illuminate the laughable eccentricities of the human experience without the mean deprecations or the vulgar profanity that is too often the hallmark of comtemporary humorists. I was looking for a book to put a chuckle or two in my day; I got one that at times had me frequently laughing out loud. Thanks Ellen.
B001KQZ7I8|5|This is one of the greatest books ever written.  Very inspiring.  I continually revisit this book (reading and audio).  It offers great perspective, and the speaks to the capacity of the human mind, body, and soul to overcome.
B00005TQKQ|5|Met expectations
B00005V9HH|4|Though this movie isn't as good as such films as Pulp Fiction or Goodfellas, it definately sits on the top of my shelf of DVD's. It drags on a little to long, but other than that Kevin Spacey and Benicio Del Toro make the movie great. I don't want to give away the surprise ending, although probably 90% of the country has seen it, so i'll stop there. Definatley will recommend it.
B007TNQ7EY|3|Listen gameloft I love this game but I have to admit..  once you finish the storyline it gets very boring I mean sure you can rob a few banks and stop drug deals and other stuff  it it gets very repetitive it would be really cool if you can add new challenges every time you try try it also can you please please please add new vehicles more crazy vehicles like the monster truck would be nice also can you add more money drops. When you finish the story you only get like 2000 dollars each it would be really cool if you can get more<br />Can you also add more missions like bank probing there needs to be more. Challenges for extra money would be nice
B00000IAU3|5|To put it simply, No Angel is as near perfection as any album I have ever heard. There is not one song here that is not entirely original, and Dido's combination of wonderful melodies with spot-on vocals is unbelievable. <br /> <br />Track Ratings- <br /> <br />1) Here With Me- 9/10- nice chorus, but slightly unmemorable. <br />2) Hunter 10/10- simply perfect song with a great beat and catchy lyrics <br />3) Don't Think of Me- 7/10- the only average song on the album, this is song is OK but rather overblown. <br />4) My Lover's Gone- 9/10- simple and beautiful love song <br />5) All You Want 10/10- I love her vocals on this song, which also has a lovely melody and great lyrics, with a twist at the end. <br />6) Thankyou- 9.5/10- great opening which was made famous in Eminem's song Stan- the chorus doesn't really fit though. <br />7) Honestly OK- 8.5/10- this requires a few listens, but is a song where we can truly appreciate Dido's vocal talents. <br />8) Slide- 9/10- great rhytm and chorus <br />9) Isobel- 9.5/10- Touching lyrics and a great buildup to a good chorus <br />10) I'm No Angel- 10/10- for me the best song on the album- this track just blows you away with a very different, slick melody, great lyrics and vocals. <br />11) My Life- 8/10- this is just solid filler, with rather ordinary lyrics <br />12) Take My Hand- 8.5/10- this was a bonus track and is rather different, substituting the smooth rhytm of I'm No Angel with a slower, more sober love song beat.
B0089LOG02|5|I Found this book not only a moving story but also interesting history that has been hidden. Very Well written and still relates to life today.
B00H58VGIA|5|This was almost as good as &#34;The Secret Lives of Bees&#34;.  The story of the relationship between the white daughter of a slave-holding family and the black girl who is &#34;given&#34; to her as a gift is told with sympathy for both.  I was not aware until I finished the book that the story was based on that of real women during the period of our history when slavery was still very much a part of life.  I found the characters engaging and I learned a bit more about our history, especially about the Quakers.
B005CMSDLE|3|This movie was well paced and will filmed and I would have probably given it a higher rating except for the following .....<br /><br />a) The plot was 100% predictable and played out EXACTLY as you probably guessed after the first 30 minutes.  It's easy to see the whole story and know exactly how it is going to end only 30 minutes into it.<br /><br />b) I wish the music soundtrack was not so annoying.  Maybe it is my age (close to 50) ... but an action movie like this does not feel right with some Techno-Dance THUMP THUMP Bass music that sounds like it belongs in a South Beach night club.<br /><br />c) It really is pretty dull and boring with most of the story being Hannah traveling on the road with a bunch of gypsy-like people ....... sadly this makes 75% of the movie feel like filler.<br /><br />It's a bit quirky and has a little of that weird \\"euro-artsy-fartsy\\" feel to it that unfortunately serves to prevent the movie being as intense as it could be.<br /><br />It comes across kind of campy.<br /><br />Actually as I write this review and revisit the movie in my head, I like it less and less, so maybe I had better end this review before I change my mind and make it only 2 stars.
B008JGSM6G|5|fun for adults and kids. love it :) it was fun and at the same time it was challenging for the mind!
B0063GORYU|5|Entertaining, challenging. Just difficult enough and fun for the whole family to enjoy. Kudos to.mobility for a great design! Looking forward to more from them.

B00GQQ77IU|5|waiting for more
B00KNWYDU8|5|The game does have you to wait for stuff, but the time you have to wait is really small compared to other games I've seen. There are many dragons to breed and see.  I personally would play this game 24/7 if I could.
B00DUGCLY4|5|It such an amazing challenge and gets my hopes up so i love it so far
B00005NZBN|5|This album is a must have by any music fan.<BR>I like the song Floater (too much to ask) the song is just [cool]. Dylan at 60 sounds great. This album should earn more Grammy awards then Time Out of Mind. Anybody who listens to it will absolutely love it...
B008UCJ7KO|5|This is an awesome read. I couldn't put it down. I like that Gideon is so attentive to Eva's needs and wants. Every woman needs a man like that. I would definitely recommend this to my friends.
B004FRX0MY|5|I do like the fact that it has no ads and also I really like the ease of navigation thru the app.<br />The playlists are another favorite of mine as well.Great job Amazon!

0307120007|5|My mother had bought my son Pat the Puppy initially, but he was never that into it.  I remember having Pat the Bunny when I was little and loved it, so I bought it for my son as well.  He is 9 months old and loves this book!  He loves playing Peek a Boo with Paul and feeling Daddy's scratchy face.  He even pulls the book up to his face to smell the flowers and puts his finger through Mummy's Ring.  And yes of course he loves to Pat the Bunny too!  This book is a classic, but even the newest ones still like this book!
B00A8ECU24|4|I enjoy this to pass the time, get bored with it quickly though. Otherwise it's cute and fun with nice graphics. As well as many other games of this style you can only get so much without having to make in game purchases with my hard earned cash.
B00EEDJM2Q|5|The concept of this game is cool.  It seems, on the surface, a simple game; however, once I started leveling up, am feeling the challenge and difficult.  This is a great brain exercise.  I almost got stuck on a puzzle.  Am willing to work on harder levels.  Must keep my brain active and challenged.
0802130208|4|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole   A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is about an immensely overweight man who wears a green hunting cap over his balloon shaped head named Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius has many comical adventures and complains about anything he doesn't like or doesn't get to do. He must battle through life from getting a job to complaining about people that scare him. On top of all of this he still lives with his mom whom which spoils him every step of the way through his long, yet absurdly funny, journey he calls a life. Ignatius thinks that everyone surrounding has a problem whether it might be an oddity they may have or their customs of life and how they do it. He has trouble with landing a good job even though he has a master's degree. Ignatius can't even work at a hot dog stand withought ruining the job by eating the hot dogs and not paying!     In this book there are not that many things I disliked. In fact, there probably is only one thing I despised in this hilarious novel. The one and only thing I disliked about this book was the many characters in this book get confusing at times and made my head spin.     What I particularly enjoyed about this book was the descriptions of the characters. John Kennedy Toole did an amazingly excellent job describing the characters in such detail yet, at a comical fashion as well. I also enjoyed the real life accents and slang used in this book. This way of bringing out the characters gives them their own personality that is fairly realistic to the present. I really enjoyed Ignatius. Ignatius was just funny anywhere he went. Whatever Ignatius tried to do, it always ended up into something hysterical.      This book was one of the best novels I have read so far and really enjoyed the way John Kennedy Toole made all of the characters from Ignatius to Bartenders. This book was one big laugh all the way! Just the way the characters acted, talked, and their personality was hilarious.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Neat game makes you think and keeps you interested and wanting more. Glad I downloaded the game and keep playing. Everyone should get it

B00DR0PDNE|5|Love it! Bought mine when it was first released. Although it was worth $35, I wasn't thrilled to begin with. After Google's most recent update, though, ChromeCast is worth well over $100!!! It's the size of a flash drive you use in a computer. It plugs into an HDMI port on the back of your TV, it's powered by your TV or the included wall charger, and that's it, it's out of sight and out of mind, now it's time to enjoy.<br />Before if go any further : If you're reading reviews on here then look at the date they were written : If the review is 6 months or older then it might be irrelevant because the ChromeCast's abilities have changed since then. For instance, originally there were only a few apps that you were able to Cast to your TV, but over the months more and more apps gained this ability making the ChromeCast more functional.<br />THIS IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT: Google removed all restrictions and now allow ANY and ALL apps/games to Cast to your TV!! Also, they made it to where you can now Cast your device's entire display(your home screen, photos, videos, etc) to your TV, no matter what's being displayed!! This means ChromeCast now has full device screen mirroring!! You can share the photos and videos you took from your device with your friends and family on your big screen TV, instead of them all crammed around your device's small display or having them take turns passing around your device. Devices capable of mirroring their entire display include any Android device running 4.0 or higher, which is at least 90% of devices, as new devices ship with 4.4, devices have shipped with 4.0 for 1.5 years, and even 3-4 year old devices received the 4.0 update a while ago! I've personally tested this on 3 different phones(1 under current contract and 2 were my previous contract phones) an 2 tablets(7&#34; display and 10&#34; display), and all 5 worked flawlessly. I know Apple devices work with ChromeCast, but can't say whether or not they allow for full screen mirroring or not as I don't have one to test.<br />I can confirm that gaming is a console-like experience, especially if you use a wireless controller! Lag has been non-existent since the first update after Google initially allowed mirroring, so wireless controllers now work perfectly. Even though I have a PS3 and XBOX, I play games on Android more often than either of those. If you like gaming on Android then I highly recommend that you buy a ChromeCast, and a wireless controller(PS3 controllers work perfectly, so if you already have one that's money saved). I've had friends walk in and think I was playing on PS3 or XBOX, it looks that good!  Now that ChromeCast allows for complete device screen mirroring, I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't own one of these! It's definitely the best $35 that I've spent!!
B00T3DNKIE|2|It was difficult to get interested. Not all that great of a read.
B001ANSSDC|4|I really enjoyed the book.  It's a fast read.  How could any one read through this and not feel for Pat.  Too much reference to football for me but regardless of that very enjoyable.
B00I6JOBTI|5|Fun family movie. Love it
B0091XT2VK|5|Watching the unrated version made more sense of the actual movie since quite a few scenes were cut from the movie I saw earlier
B008N1LL42|5|I really enjoyed the naked patriotism and homage to the vintage warriors of an earlier age. None of the characters were cardboard characterizations. I also loved the AC/DC soundtrack.
B00CB4ET0K|4|I used to play 3-4 months ago, and near end campaign it would always crash and reset me at beginning. I hope that glitch is fixed now. Otherwise...an awesome game!
B00E5Q1LTY|5|About the movie itself, wow. I grew up on SNG and also watched STO.  For me, this brings me back. It's everything you want a movie to be, amazing. Hats off to Gene, the writers, the actors, JJ. I can watch this all day. Awesome, Epic, life changing.
B00004YA66|5|I bought the DVD and was very happy with it.  The cast was great. The movie kept my attention and I can easily sit through this a second time.  Dennis Quaid is a favorite of mine, and he had a great performance.  Can't wait to see his next movie.
B008JGSM6G|5|I've had this game on my iPhone for a while now. I've beaten all the packs the come with the app including extra packs I have purchased to feed my addiction. But I was uber excited to redownload it onto my kindle fire to relive all the joy again! I could play this game for hours!!
B00BETX5PS|4|Good movie, however, I am used to James Bond having all these gadgets, cars, etc. that make the film exciting.  It had a tracking device... big deal, so does my cell phone.  Rather slow film at times and not the best of James Bond.<br /><br />On another note, I had the film stop and start three times.  Each time the words kept going but the film stopped.  Amazon made this right with me so no complaints.
B00G15MDI0|5|{4.5 stars}<br /><br />THE BOOK THIEF is the most poignant and haunting film that I have seen in some time, one that will stay with me for years. Sophie N&eacute;lisse gives an outstanding performance as Liesel Meminger, an initially illiterate but incredibly imaginative and independent girl who's full of splendid metaphors and similes --e.g., \\"The sun looks like a silver oyster\\"--and, with the help of various diverse people, discovers the power of books and the written word while living with foster parents in Hitler's Germany. Virtually every other player in this film gives a fine performance, and the very special narrator, Roger Allam as the somber yet strangely unforbidding voice of Death, adds a distinct touch, coming in at just the right crucial moments.<br /><br />I have never seen anything remotely like THE BOOK THIEF and can only say that I wish there were more like it. The best way I can describe it is like a dark yet ultimately heartwarming Disney film for adults. It is, of course, a Fox 2000 production expertly directed by Englishman Brian Percival, spoken mostly in English--albeit, with some speeches in German w/English subtitles--with a cast of various nationalities. Still, the characters are all most convincingly German. It captures the lives of ordinary German citizens during WWII in a way I've never seen done in any non-German film. The accents and various mannerism are very, very real and immediate. The cinematography is also excellent, with stunning views of the town and countryside and, even when viewed from approaching Allied bombers, the sky above them. THE BOOK THIEF is driven mostly by its characters, themes, and atmosphere. Nevertheless, even if it takes a while to find itself, the plot also makes perfect sense (allowing for the various elements of magical realism), moves at a natural pace, and is ultimately quite gripping.<br /><br />Though I loved every second of this film, a common criticism seems to be that it simply does not do justice to Markus Zusak's original novel, [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]]. Film adaptations, of course, often make serious departures from the books that spawned them, and it's fairly impossible to completely capture a really great novel on screen. Though I have not yet read the novel, I could tell that the directors and writers had a lot to pick and choose regarding what/whatnot to show. There are a few patchy spots: In particular, I wanted a little better sense of Liesel's origins. In this respect, I can only say that this film should prove an excellent illuminator for the book, which I am now eager to read.us Zusak's original novel, [[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]].

0312641893|5|Reinvented fairy tales set in current or sci-fi setting seems to be on the upswing these days.  With such a classic tale retold for the 100th time, I asked myself, could it really be fresh?  Absolutely.  A wonderful tale told simply and well. Intriguing, sweet and fun.  Must read.

B0017SWPXY|5|It is a bit of a surprise that I'm giving a rave review to a novel which is told in the first person and that person is a mixed breed dog. But words flow effortlessly from the mind of this dog, who has learned a lot from watching educational television, which his human leaves on for him when he goes to work. The dog's name is Enzo, after a formula one race car driver, I surmise.<br />Enzo loves his human, Denny so much, and later Denny's wife and child, that he believes he might be born into a human body in his next incarnation.<br />Stein makes Enzo seem exactly like the very best type of canine companion. Enzo is a witness to the ups and down's of his family's life. They have no idea that he not only understands every word they say but also understands human nature, And is often frustrated by his inability to talk to them. He does manage to be helpful occasionally, none the less.<br />I learned a bit about formula one racing from this book, as Denny is a semi-pro driver.<br />I've never had a dog of my own but I've been friends with a few and I think they make great family members.<br />It was very easy to read but don't think I mean dumbed down. Enzo has an extensive vocabulary and the author keeps the story going a a brisk pace.<br />I recommend this book to any one who likes a good human interest story, especially if they are a dog lover.

B000002H72|5|Hey !  This is one of those CDs that make you think about real talent. Pixies were never considered great musicians, but they changed music and influenced bands all around the globe. if you don't have this album, you'd  die unexperienced. Buy this one and Trompe Le Monde to start your pixies  collection. I'll tell ya, you'll fall in love with Kim's Voice, Black  Francis' words, J Santiago's chords, and Lovering's beat. The only thing i  hate about it, is that the PIXIES are no longer around.

B00BFV1LZG|5|I started this book at 9pm and, despite my best intentions of having an early night, found myself finishing it at midnight. I couldn't put it down.  A result, I had some crazy dreams, and I'm rather tired today, but it was totally worth it.<br /><br />The action is nonstop, the writing flows like a torrent, and the ending punches you both the gut and the head at the same time. Thank goodness I only discovered this book after the entire trilogy was already released - as you can tell, I'm not a delayed-gratification sort of person.<br /><br />I had heard of this book, but had no idea what it was about till I saw the movie trailer. I'm glad I picked up the book straight away. It's going to make a hell of a movie, as it plays like a movie in your head as you're reading it.<br /><br />My only quibble is that there only one girl in it. Not only boys are survivalists, you know. But I'm hoping, as hinted by the epilogue, that this will be developed in the next books, which I'm forcing myself to wait a few days before I buy. I need to recover from the truly terrifying and exhilarating action of book 1 first - because I know I won't be sleeping well till I find out what happens next.

B000003TA4|5|I heard about this band named Nirvana, when i was just a kid.  My friends loved the band and told me to listen to them, you know give them a chance.  I gave them a chance, I wasn't expecting to be knocked on my butt. Nirvana and NeverMind, especially, changed music forever, killing metal and saving the melody.  Nevermind is a masterful blend of punk rock and heavy grunge, not to mention the harsh heartfelt vocals of Kurt Cobain.  The Greatest drummer of all time Dave, or as my brother would say, \\"G-d\\" and Krist.  Together they created some of the best written songs of all time, \\"Smells like teen spirit, Something In The Way, etc.\\"  With some of the greatest songs ever they took the world by storm and saved music, thanks Nirvana. <BR>RIPKC

0793927501|4|This film is one I recommend...an interesting character exploration of Charles and Bob develops as they undergo threat after threat to their lives...the interplay between the two brings out the best and the worst of human nature and values.  I appreciated this film's depiction of a truth found in life:  That those who have that which others seek (be it money, fame, success, respect, accomplishments, etc.) must always be cautious and wary of those around them and their motives for befriending or being involved with them.  I appreciated this film because it depicted this predicament very well...who can be trusted?  What are other's motives?  It also illustrated that there are those of principle and honor...no matter what the provocation.   <br /> <br />The beautiful videography of the Canadian Rockies...the musical score...and the bear encounters were all superbly done. <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching this very well made film...and must also add that Anthony Hopkins has again given us an excellent performance of a highly intelligent man--the type of character he is perfect in portraying. <br /> <br />I highly recommend The Edge.

B00168OINK|5|I was on a long flight back from California when I had the choice between watching Kung Fu Panda on a tiny television screen four feet away from me, or read the SkyMall catalog.  I wisely chose to watch Kung Fu Panda.<br /><br />I was curious as to how Kung Fu Panda would present itself: as a Lion King-style retelling of ancient Chinese myth, or as a love note to kung fu films from an American perspective.  I'm pleased to report that it's the latter.<br /><br />You know the story: Po (a restrained Jack Black) adores the Furious Five but is too fat and slow to ever hope to become one of them and then fate does precisely that. It's the heroes who have the real problem (each representing a different kung fu style and all voiced by a roster of celebrities, including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Lucy Liu). Struggling most of all is Master Shifu - a bit redundant, if you know the definition of Shifu - played by Dustin Hoffman (wouldja believe?) who is still suffering from the betrayal of his first and best pupil Tai Lung (Ian McShane).<br /><br />What's surprising about Kung Fu Panda is how adult the story is.  The word \\"kill\\" is mentioned several times.  Tai Lung and Shifu have a physical conflict that is much a battle of philosophies as it is a father and son having an argument.  And the plot is beautiful in its symmetry, perfectly tying in every element: from the modified style of kung-food training that Shifu teaches Po to the revelation of Po's (we can only assume adopted) duck-father's secret recipe to the fact that Po is immune to acupuncture (because he's so fat, of course) Kung Fu Panda is tightly scripted and wrapped up in a beautiful package.<br /><br />The movie itself (what I could see on the tiny airplane screen) is beautifully produced.  It ranges from Chinese-style art to realistic but soft-colored tones, to bursts of color amidst pitch darkness.  The fight scenes are all in exciting locations: in a prison, on a rope bridge, in an ancient temple.  It's like a videogame, only you're watching the fat guy character nobody wants to play. It was beautiful enough that I had a pang of regret that I wasn't watching it on a big screen. Or even a medium screen.<br /><br />For kids, Po is a great tale about overcoming obstacles by being yourself.  For geeks, Po is a hilarious new hero archetype: the fanboy as hero, a fat, slobbering devotee who knows more details about the Furious Five than they know about themselves.atching the fat guy character nobody wants to play.

B0071XO8RA|5|I'm a big fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender series.  Otherwise, I don't do this particular genre too much.  These books are positively addicting.  I got the omnibus edition, finished in less than one week, then immediately purchased the two Silo books and finished them both in one day each.  Very engaging characters and storyline, must read!
B00TYB95I4|4|Different!
B001O8C5KK|5|I am in total agreement with Mr. Moore's review, especially on one point. Jonas Kaufmann is a splendid tenor whose voice and style best suit the German side of the repertoire rather than the Italian. But I feel this new \\"Butterfly\\" should be put into perspective. The recorded sound is impeccable; Pappano's conducting is as good as any on disc. Gheorghiu's voice and style suit Cio-Cio San very well. Is she the vocal equal of Leontyne Price in this role or the dramatic equal of Callas, Freni, Scotto, and de los Angeles? No, but she comes blessedly close. Looking back over the past twenty years, I'd pick her ovr any rivals. The warmth, intimacy, and femininity of her protrayal remind me of Anna Moffo.<br /><br />So many of the ingredients needed for a successful opera recording are present here, and they mesh so well, that I can begrudge Pinkerton his (minor) faults. After all, Kaufmann's voice is strong, well placed, ringing on top, and musically applied. Those qualities count for a lot, especially in the absence of a rising Italian tenor who might better him. (Villazon is tied up with a rival company, of course.) Ramon Vargas and Marcello Alvarez come closer to the timbre of a  true Puccini tenor, I suppose, but I think Kaufmann surpasses them in dramatic passion and electricity.

B0083H6AQA|4|This film was beautifully and lovingly photographed and sucessfully evoked the era. That said, the story was difficult for me to follow not having read the novel first. Robert Pattinson was every bit as beautiful as the story required yet it was hard to believe his baser instincts. He seemed like a nice guy, and the character wasn't really a very nice guy. I recommend it for the pleasure of seeing Pattinson, but watch the old George Sanders film for the story.

B005SZNZAY|5|Songbook is the new live acoustic album from Chris Cornell showcasing his awesome vocals and songwriting ability as performed along his very successful recent solo tour. Chris Cornell is a true survivor of rock having had success with Soundgarden, Audioslave, and three solo albums prior to this amazing collection of acoustic tunes. There was a little taste of what this album contains with the hidden track at the end of his previous solo album but Songbook is definitely what fans of this iconic voice wanted to hear. Highlights include the amazing Temple Of The Dog classic \\"Call Me A Dog\\", the brilliant version of the Audioslave track \\"I Am The Highway\\", the dark sound of Soundgarden's classic track \\"Fell On Black Days\\", and the memorable melodies of the Audioslave hit \\"Like A Stone\\". It is amazing how he can turn relatively simple chord progressions into memorable songs with his powerful voice and interesting lyrics. I saw Chris Cornell perform these songs at The Sydney Opera House recently and I can tell you it was a stunning show and Songbook is a great memento of his tour. What more can be said about Chris Cornell and his decision to please his fans with a gift like this - essential listening!

1439148953|2|With a few exceptions, one-dimensional characters, a heroine who, in the film version might have been played by somebody such as Dolores Hart, and the last fifty or so pages read as though cut from a novel by some hack on the order of Nora Roberts. The author throws in a lesbian scene for no apparentreason, and a sexual initiation scene seemingly written by someone aiming for an audience of young adults of high school age.<br /><br />Having said all that, I realize I'm in the minority here. Critics far more credible than myself have praised this work to the proverbial &#34;hilt.&#34;
6302752337|3|I am 25 years old right now, and the first time I saw this movie, I had no clue what they were trying to get across. Now I am fascinated by it, and its controvery is far more apparent to me. My best recomendation to anyone who is going to see this for the first time and did not live in the 60s is to learn more about the time period first. That way, when you see Henry Fonda stuffing money into his gas tank so he can buy drugs on his road trip, you will realize that the mainstream reaction was &quot;Oh my lord, how can someone do such a thing, like actually plan out that they know that they will want drugs in the near future.&quot; And there is even more to that shot besides what I have tried to articulate. So there is no sure fire way to explain this movie to anyone too young to remember when it first came out. However, if one makes the effort (and not an extreme one is needed) the times and feelings of the 60s can become intelligible. I can honestly say that now being able to watch this movie and understand it is a most rewarding experience for me, so all I can say is I hope it can be for others like myself.

0345442989|5|After the release of Kathy Tyer's Balance Point, I have found each subsequent Star Wars novel to be disappointing.  To be fair, the NJO books are more a case of central plot that bad writing, but I am also inspired by The Phantom Menace, and want to immerse myself in the old Republic and the ways of the Jedi.  Though Darth Maul's ill conceived novel was utter trash, James Luceno has come through with a ripping good yarn that delves into the most complicated parts of Episode I - the politics, and how Palpatine  manipulates them.<br />In Cloak, which has to be the ultimate Star Wars politically thriller, Luceno weaves several nefarious plots that threaten to collide, as well as sets up much of the plot to Episode I.  In it, Chancellor Valorum tries to deal both to the greedy Trade Federation and the violent Nebula Front, a terrorised organization, which soon leads to an attempted assassination and the mobilization of the Jedi Council.  At the same time, Palpatine subtly manoeuvrers all around him towards a secret and singular goal.  <br />This book is chock full of intrigue and characters, with enough action thrown in to keep us Jedi fans amused without resorting to Bad Plot Devices like Numerous Dark Jedi and silly SuperTech that Star Wars avoids so well.  Also, many characters from other books show up in amusing cameos.  But the best thing is how Palpatine stars in this book without taking center stage.  Much like the character indeed (I especially love the way both he AND Sideous are dealing with the Front!)  After his exciting entrance into the SW universe with Hero's Trial, Luceno proves himself here to be one of the best SW authors around, rising up into the ranks that contain a select few, including the unbeatable Zahn, Stackpole and Perry.  Hopefully, this will not be Luceno's last stand in the SW galaxy, and that goes double for the world of the old Republic.

B00846REIS|5|BARED TO YOU is one of those books I’ve looked at many times on shelves at the library and book stores with mild interest but never really with enough to compel me to pick it up. I’ve been trying to branch out from YA this past year and try new genres in particular romance in all its shades and the massive interest in Sylvia Day finally convinced me this series would be worth trying and WOW is that interest justified!<br /><br />BARED TO YOU is about Eva, having recently moved to NYC with her best friend Cary; she’s looking forward to a fresh start after recovering from a very dark time in her past. Unfortunately her over-wrought mother is a little zealous in her protectiveness of her daughter after feeling like she failed her so desperately in the past but Eva is determined to strike out on her own and starts a job as an executive assistant at a firm in the Crossfire building owned by enigmatic billionaire Gideon Cross. A chance meeting between the two sparks a passionate affair that tests their emotional defences to the limit and beyond.<br /><br />It’s not often that I am so captivated by two people and root for them so deeply but Sylvia Day really made me care for Eva and Gideon! I warmed to Eva immediately and really liked how despite the fact she is one of the 1% and is privileged to the max, she’s not spoilt. She appreciates the position she is in due to her background but is eager to work and make a place for herself based on her own merits. She’s also deeply caring and protective of her friends, especially Cary and I loved their dynamic although I doubt I would be quite so forgiving of some of the more extreme aspects of his lifestyle! She’s put up walls for the darkest of reasons and despite the immediate chemistry with Gideon, she refuses to give her heart to the undeserving and boy does she make Gideon work for it! While their sex life could rival the heat from an active volcano and is just as explosive, the emotional side of their relationship is quite sweet and passionate and makes you want them to find peace and happiness in each other.<br /><br />Gideon Cross…hello primal hunk of goodness – While he definitely embodies a lot of the more infuriating alpha male characteristics seen in these novels – demanding, stubborn, and controlling – there’s an intense vulnerability that Eva brings out in him which is just wonderful. I loved the moments where they connected on a deeper level than just sex. This brings me to the sex…yeah…wow! I don’t think I’ve read quite such a descriptive book with such steamy scenes but boy can Day paint a graphic and &#60;ahem&#62; affecting picture…we’ll say no more!!<br /><br />One thing that really stood out for me and made me fall in love was the writing! Sylvia Day has the most beautiful, eloquent style that enthralled me. I loved her descriptive passages that really made me picture New York and I felt like I was right there with Eva and Gideon (but like not at steamy times because that would be awkward!!!) This book is high on drama and really puts you though the ringer but I loved every minute!<br /><br />Sexy, emotional, highly passionate and oh so addictive – BARED TO YOU is a definite hit for this girl!ship is quite sweet and passionate and makes you want them to find peace and happiness in each other.<br /><br />Gideon Cross…hello primal hunk of goodness – While he definitely embodies a lot of the more infuriating alpha male characteristics seen in these novels – demanding, stubborn, and controlling – there’s an intense vulnerability that Eva brings out in him which is just wonderful.

6305078181|5|Out of all one million Dracula movies, that follow the Bram Stoker Vision, this is the best one. I myself, have always found a little bit of remorse for the old guy and this keeps the dream alive. Frank Langella plays the perfect Dracula, he's very subdued yet very powerful at the same time. This movie doesn't have alot of uneccessary blood and gut sceens yet it tells the story perfectly. The scenes and backdrop are perfect for the time and give the movie an eerie feeling. Being made in the late seventies, this movie has pretty good effects. If you want to pick one movie out of the hundreds that have been done about Bram Stokers Dracula then this one should be the one to pick.
B005LAIGWS|2|This movie sucked compared to the first one. The bike was junk compared to the fist one (when transformed). The special affects looked like something from 10 yrs ago. The plot was semi silly, the primary bad guy with the power of rot was stupid. I wasted 2hrs of my life I can't get back watching this film, do not recommend unless you have absolutely nothing else to do for 2hrs.

B000JK8OYU|5|If someone were to tell you that a new Beatles album was out and it was made partially for Cirque Du Soleil, you'd probably remember the 1978 Peter Frampton/Bee Gees travesty and scream in horror!  No worries here.  George Martin himself (and son) have taken over 30 Beatles songs (and an uncountable amount of true Beatles special effects) and made a masterpiece.  From the quiet, bird-chirping beginning of \\"Because\\" to the anthemic \\"All You Need Is Love\\", one is treated to a musical masterpiece.  No song is presented in its entirety nor is any song given short shrift.  Using original Beatles soundtracks and effects, each song is seamlessly sequenced into the next giving an almost psychedelic experience.  In fact, some of the special sound effects will make you feel as if you'd taken more than an aspirin.  The experience truly is one that anyone, even the most fanatical of Beatles fans, will appreciate.  That's just the regular CD!  If you play the DTS 5.1 DVD on a good system, your mind will be blown!  This is one of those musical experiences that you just cannot believe was made so well, so exquisitely, so amazingly.  It is the Beatles.

B00BWQW73E|5|The  secret to Amazon's success is that it is customer focused, almost to a fault. In other words, Jeff Bezos has sacrificed everything to give customers the lowest price. Along the way he has beguiled America like a snake charmer; customers and investors have crawled into bed with him despite the fact that Amazon is not the most profitable company. Take nothing away from him; has he transformed how items are sold on the Internet Yet, the way that Jeff Bezos achieved his success reminds me of a quote by Einstein, \\"It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.\\"

B00DVXVMT6|4|I was skeptical to buy this album because I was pretty disappointed with \\"The Age of Hell\\", but the reviews convinced me, and they were spot on! It really is a return to \\"Resurrection\\" but with far more complex drums. It's a ton of fun to listen to. I've been headbanging in the car to nothing but this for the past week. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because of my only 2 gripes. 1) The studio quality kinda sucks. It's poorly mixed, and it almost sounds like they exported the album in 128kbps audio. It's a bit of a let down, but is fairly easily ignored when the excellence of music is hammering your ears. 2) The lead solo's are nowhere near as good as they used to be.<br /><br />If you can get over that, BUY THIS ALBUM. You'll love it. My favorite song is \\"Kings of the Shadow World\\". Listen to it every day.

140131046X|4|When Mitch Albom reconnected with his Sociology Professor (see Albom's book Tuesday's With Morrie) he had little notion of the impact that action would have on his life.  Within eight years, he has gone from an agnostic, nonobservant Jew to one who has grasped the power and worth of being God-minded.  The path he has taken to arrive at this juncture has been recorded in his books and his readers have had the privilege of witnessing this transformation from \\"inside\\" Mr. Albom's own experience.  Those who have read his previous books will better appreciate the story that is the under-tale of this present work.  Those who choose to begin reading Mr. Albom's work with this small book will be delighted with their starting point but will soon find themselves seeking his other works.<br />Mitch Albom's Rabbi asked him to deliver the eulogy.  As Mr. Albom had not been an active member of his congregation since he had gone to college, and this Rabbi was not presently ill, this request caused him no little amount of consternation.  He saw Rabbi Albert Lewis, a.k.a. \\"Reb,\\" as an untouchable \\"Man of God.\\"  How does one eulogize an idol?  He quickly realized his need to get to know the man who is this Rabbi so he could, when the time came, properly fulfill the request.  In order to accomplish this goal he began doing what he learned with Morrie, regular visits with the Reb, what lasted eight months with the Professor, ended up taking eight years with the Reb.<br /><br />In the time Mr. Albom spent with \\"the Reb,\\" he learned of another \\"Man of God,\\" who appeared as anything but.  Henry Covington grew up in the intercity, reared by parents who loved him but whose relationship with each other was often less than peaceful.  He turned to a life of crime early in life, spent time in prison for a crime he did not commit (but one his vanity helped get him convicted) and in a moment of clarity that became epiphany, he changed and began to minister to those who were like him.  Mr. Albom found Rev. Covington, whose parishioners call \\"Reb,\\" ministering in intercity Detroit in a dilapidated, once grand church building.  The church had a hole in its roof so large the congregation had to build shelter in the sanctuary in order to have some sanctuary from the elements of a Detroit winter.<br />What the author learned in these eight years spent in contact with these men (he continues to have contact with Rev. Covington) is as subtle as it is profound.  He is able to \\"sit at the feet\\" of his Rabbi and learn what made him so holy.  He is able to connect with one whom society would deem \\"outcast\\" and discover the Good News that no one is cast away.  Most profoundly, Mr. Albom discovers the holiness that resides in him.  This Holiness can be dimmed by action (or inaction) but it can never be quenched completely.  He grasps this when he takes note of the good he has done when he has chosen \\"not to do bad,\\" when he begins to act as one who is capable of greater good and is connected to the world through the commonness of experience.  Ultimately, Mr. Albom sees both \\"Rebs\\" as men of God not because of who they are, but because of how they understand God to be.  They both want only to tell others of what they have found.  To do so is sound, life-affirming, soul-building preaching of the most powerful kind - which is that done without words.

B00CO8D3G4|4|James Altucher's book is not going to sit well with some who think that it is a dog eat dog world but he has succeeded because he chooses to give great value and do what is right by him.
B002QYUVY8|1|the movie did not hold my interest. it was shallow. the plot felt silly. not really worth the time to spend on it. not entertaining
B00008L3U1|5|Quick and easy
B00HXYKYIE|4|I could not reconcile myself with the reasoning until the very end. I kept thinking this is not right they are missing something. The twist at the end was something I would not have guessed. Great read!!!

0804139075|5|I'm a huge fan of glee and I skimmed this book in the mall one afternoon and thought it would be a great gift for my mom.<br />The book is filled with great tips and advise on diet/recipes, exercise and personal grooming, etc along with Lea Michele's story on her life.<br />I plan to get this book back from my mother cause I know she isn't reading it anymore. This review is coming from a guy too!

B00H58VGIA|5|Beautifully crafted. The characters are very alive. I felt I knew them each. Well worth the read.
0671027344|5|This book was very touching in a way that most books are not. The main character, Charlie is a very emotional kid, he's a freshman, but he sounds much younger because he is innocent and honest. He offers observations and thoughts about everything he sees around him in a beautiful way. He cries about every other page, and he had me doing the same. This book was nostalgic for me, and I think whether or not you can relate to Charlie, you will find yourself reliving the experience of growing up. Mostly it is about feelings, the ones you wish would last forever that are always outweighed by the ones you wish you never had to have.  I recommend this book as a break from the everyday reality to focus on the things that are really important in your life, and the lives of those you love.
B0049U4NQO|5|Its a really good last book for the Alex Rider series with an old enemy that comes back to haunt him .The book has alot of twists and turns with a sad yet great end a must read for all young smart,action lovers!
B00BAXFECK|5|this book was so well written that I couldn't put it down.  Great fiction
B001GCUO16|4|Like many Generation X'rs, I'm a big fan of the XMen. I saw, and subsequently purchased, all three previous XMen titles and thoroughly enjoyed them. I think in those cases it was nice to see how the characters were discovered and how they grew in the XMen Universe.<br /><br />In the case of this first \\"Origins\\" picture, I think many of us really wanted to see how the \\"legend of the animal\\" (Wolverine) would play out on the big screen, well in this case, the flat screen plasma. I for one welcomed the chance to see how the characters would come together. In a word, the characters fell \\"FLAT\\". Aside from Sabretooth, the other characters were not fleshed out very well. Yes, Stan Lee and Company probably assumed that most people read the XMen comics and know the backstories and bi-lines of each character in the movie. I'm going from the standpoint here of someone who did not, though in all honesty, I do.<br /><br />In my opinion, too much was crammed into too little screen time, resulting in a poorly executed mess, with great visual and audio effects. Yes, we just HAD to see:<br /><br />1) the half-brother link between Wolverine and Sabretooth and how they fought in so many wars over like a hundred year timeframe<br />2) how Wolverine and the special strike team (team X) came into existence and what types of special ops assignments they carried out<br />3) Wolverines relationship with mutant girl-friend Silver Fox<br />4) how Gambit and Wolverine made acquaintance<br />5) how DeadPool was created and so much more.<br /><br />The thing is, it would have been nice to stretch the movie out perhaps an extra 20 or 30 minutes and really, really dig deeper into each situation while making the segue's less jarring and difficult to handle. The movie was a mere 109 minutes. An extra 20 or 30 minutes would not have made the movie unbearable. I mean, many movies in the theaters nowadays are about 2 - 2 1/2 hours long anyway.<br /><br />Like the previous 3 XMen movies, XMen Origin's action was top notch. The CG effects were done almost perfectly and believably. Well, let me rephrase that. The CG effects were believable MOST of the times. 2 times that come to mind that are laughably cheesy are 1) when Wolverine's adamantium claws in certain shots looked like poor, cartoony paper renditions of metal and 2) the diamondesque exterior of Emma Frost looked like a 4 year old child with loads of Elmer's Glue, \\"Bedazzle Beads\\" and silver glitter was unleashed onto the actress. If you have a decent surround sound setup, your sub(s) and surround speakers will truly be exhausted come the ending credits.<br /><br />Some of the mutant characters that make an appearance in this film (in no particular order) are:<br /><br />WOLVERINE<br />SABRETOOTH<br />DEADPOOL<br />SILVER FOX<br />THE BLOB/FRED DUKES<br />AGENT ZERO/MAVERICK<br />JOHN WRAITH/KESTREL<br />BOLT<br />EMMA FROST<br />CYCLOPS<br /><br />All in all, after considering the character development, storyline, special effects, backstory, video transfer and audio options, I give this DVD a 4 out of 5.action was top notch.

1594489505|5|This is a great book and should be read by all teen and older children. It tells of the terrible abuse of power which exists in the world today. It will make all readers very thankful for the rule of law in our country which is in contrast to the rule of might which exists in Afganistan and other countries in the world. It also suggests that the abuse of women which is advocated in the name of religion is ever present in many countries in the Middle East. The notion that women are inferior or even to be considered as \\"property\\" must be changed or these countries will remain tribal and subject to political instability.

0811875040|5|Beautiful cookbook! Scalloped edged pages. I have been to their little bakery at the pier in San Francisco, and that is why I bought the cookbook. The Pots de Creme is amazing! Best ever! I haven't made anything yet, but the book is well organized. I can't wait to try these recipes!
B0054W4JQK|3|Great story, kept me reading non stop but really disappointing ending - a really anti climatic finish that left me hanging which really annoys me!

B00378VGGO|5|Mr. Fox is an excellent film packed with both obvious and subtle humor. As such, the movie has great repeat watching value. I always find something new to give me a good laugh. While it’s better to only rent most moves, Mr. Fox is worth a full purchase because it has great rewatchability.
B00005JPCF|5|This is a great movie. It shows facts about penguins in a way that kids understand. And is very amusing. I love Robin Williams in this, he is great. Wonderful movie, great for the whole family.

B00BMVTS1S|5|Again, immersion into a fantasy world most impressive. Bought Smaug also, watching on high def tv is almost like the movie.
1607747308|3|Parts of this book appealed to me and will help me to get rid of some things.  The author's obvious tendency towards super-organization may not be realistic for all people.
B001OQCV6A|5|it was great loved it.  must see the second one
B00BSBR9N6|5|Excellent read!
B00H71PHS0|5|We had not watched this until I got the first 4 season DVDS set......have gotten hooked. My husband really enjoys it too.
B003TSEEDY|5|I thought this book was very inspiring... It was very enjoyable to read and you really connect with Charlie and feel for him
B001H1SVO8|5|Be very ready to have your mind blown.  I saw something new in my second, third, fourth and even fifth viewings.
B005ZMUQCK|5|My 3 year old son LOVES this movie.  It's also super cute for adults with a little humor thrown in without being inappropriate.
B00006F83Y|3|\\"Songs for the Deaf\\" is kind of a dissapointment, when it comes to \\"Stoner Rock\\" Even though the genere isn't filled with that many bands, there are better albums to listen to in this genere. \\"Clutch\\", Fu-Man-Chu\\", \\"Monster Magnet\\", \\"Entombed\\" and \\"Kyruss\\" (members from QOTSA are present here, or should I say, before QOTSA) are much better. This is a basic album, with nothing to special. I was expecting a bit more variety, and some more jams, but at times the album starts to drag through the mud. Its not a bad album, its just not as good as I believe it could be, considering there are some great muscians on this album
0345495004|1|I have been listening to this book on CD and couldn't finish the second of twelve CD's. Mamah's character is one-dimensional and for a woman who is evidently trying to find acknowledgement for her creative sensibilities, is astonishingly mute in her marriage. For example,her husband Edwin initiated giving her owl jewelry and figurines as presents, which she accepts without a word but with internal annoyance. Regardless of what era she's living in, what happened to \\"Honey,thanks for the owls, but it's not really to my taste-why don't I tell you more about what I would like\\". The author gives her no voice within her marriage to become closer to Edwin by taking any risk to let him know her. What was so terribly wrong with him? We never get to know. The few examples that are given are bizarre. The few hairs on the top of his head resembled banjo strings. Really? Other metaphors are trite. She and Frank were \\"spit out by fate\\" to be together because they were born around the same time.        The author may have been limited by the document-based nature of her fictionalization, which perhaps provides her with little knowledge about Mamah's childhood or personality development, but we are left with a rather passive person who seems to get obsessively attracted to a married man's charisma and creativity. She unhappily has to wait for him to become available,but doesn't seem to try to develop her own creativity. Hardly the story of a woman becoming liberated. It instead presents a woman who is selfishly able to leave children and family behind for a man who is a genius but also has a narcissistic personality disorder. That actually could have been interesting had that been written about with more skill.
B00687Q0VC|5|I like the history. An that the people become real to you not just from a book. You understand what was happening an the emotion behind it.
B00GKKU22K|5|Another great read and totally can't wait for the next addition to the IAD series
B0040I09RM|4|When I heard about this series -- centered around a motorcycle gang named Sons of Anarchy -- it really did not appeal to me.  I never watched the original airings on FX network.  But, on Amazon Prime Instant Video, I watched the first two episodes from Season 1 and my wife and I were immediately hooked by the interesting characters, intriguing stories and killer cast.<br /><br />We are now binge-watching and nearing the end of Season 1.  I expect we will watch every episode over the next few months.  A great show!
B005I6EU7U|5|I love this cover.  Looks like a real book not just another black leather case!  I read the reviews and glad I wasn't scared off by people saying it was too stiff or that it is too hard to put into the case or that it takes to long for the cover to \\"fit\\" to the Fire.  I just kept it face down and the cover fit to the Fire within a few days.  It is beautiful!
B00632HWOG|5|Let's me know what I did or bought quick  with just one touch of a button on my kindle fire
B00R3DODWI|5|Super
B00EOFIYZA|4|I already own Halcyon and am not going to dock stars for that. Its just childish especially with so many Ellie fans who'd split the cost.<br /><br />Songs I'd HIGHLY recommend:<br />Tessellate<br />Burn<br />Under Control<br /><br />Great tracks, smooth, powerful, and they flow perfectly. I purchased all the others I could as singles and its nice to hear new Ellie tracks however I'd highly recommend getting remixes of the others (if they come out or ever even exist).<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that her cover of 'High for This' wasn't on the album or even on amazon as I refuse to give apple a dime.<br /><br />For those three tracks you'll pay less than you would for a sandwich and hear all the extra tracks worth hearing.
B00L24IJCY|5|Very funny and never a slow moment. Great for families and kids.
B003UBTX6S|4|I'm reading the entire series and it's good.  Not as good as Twilight or Hunger Games, but it was a good read.
1594202273|5|Command and Control is incredibly researched and written, deeply moving, thought provoking, conceptually brilliant, and a culturally much needed book on an often overlooked but globally scary problem.  It is a page turner and I had trouble setting it down.  Read it.
B0026P3G12|5|Susan Boyle's debut album shows the many kinds of songs she can sing.  I truly believe she is where she was born to be?  Over eight million in sales and still going strong.  Her life did not kill the dream she dreamed.
B002UWH8P6|5|It's just great! Like a good book, it's hard to put down!
B007J4T2G8|4|I held off reading this for a long time because I thought it might be to uncomfortable for me to read,however, I am now captivated by this love story and can't wait to read the next book in the series

0425152251|5|We own several copies of this book because we keep lending it out.  I wish I had a secret mentor who would excite my curiosity and love of learning the way Sophie does.  Her secret mentor presents the history of philosophy in a way that anyone can understand.  And knowing the history really helps me understand what philosophy is all about.  If you are curious and love to use your mind, this is a must read.
0385340540|1|I have only finished reading half of the book and I couldn't continue anymore.  It was a big yawn.    The first half of the book is about a middle-aged white guy who gets released early from prison with a string attached.  The Feds smuggle him out of the U.S. into Italy.  And I said to myself: Okay, let's fun begins.  Well, wrong.  Up to half of the book, that poor guy struggles to learn a new language while sightsees a new country.  I don't need to see that.    So I closed the book and returned it to the library.    If they turn this book into a movie, they'd probably pack the first half of the book into a 5-minute screen time.
1596680180|5|good product
B001E45XT4|5|great for the price.  Very comfortable.  It took me a bit to get used to them as I can't hear myself speak as well with them on but now I'm fine with it.
B00K0OI42W|5|There is nothing I can add to all the praise and criticism heaped on TKAM. But I *can* add that, as late as the 1950s and early 1960s when I grew up ... children entertained themselves hour after hour, day after day, in those lazy summer months after the last day of school. With certain variations imposed by location, my childhood mirrored that of Jem, Scout and Dill. After our chores there was no Internet, toys were few and crude, television was 10&#34; screens showing black and white shows of no interest to kids. The radio played boring grown-up music, news and crop reports. What did we do? On bicycles or by foot, we wandered our neighborhoods and the adjoining woods and fields. I often went to the library. My buddies and I threw rocks, waded in creeks, played marbles, baseball, hide-and-seek, capture the flag, cowboys-and-Indians and a frequent favorite ... war. The bad guys were the Japs and Germans. The good guys were Americans. We were nearly always out of sight of adults. Littler kids were given geographical boundaries that limited their movement. Bigger kids, especially boys, wandered widely ... to the park, the city swimming pool, the railroad yard. Girls had less freedom to roam and we pitied them. We went home when we got hungry, or it got dark, or we heard Dad whistle. We filled our pockets with treasures ... a rock shaped like a bear, a piece of copper cable, a battered screwdriver found in a ditch. Some old coots wouldn't let you in their yard, even to recover a lost baseball. Some houses and people, we knew to avoid. We made up stories to fill in the blanks of our knowledge of the world. Harper Lee managed to recreate the best parts of my childhood in her book and for that I'm grateful.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Very addicting  Love the challenge keeps u coming back for more ! Can be frustrating trying to to reach your star goals to advance but I thoroughly enjoy the game
B00BLCHZC2|5|I'm glad to see the History Channel is slowly redeeming itself from the pseudo-shows of ancient aliens and other science fiction 'what ifs' in lieu of something that actually resembles HISTORY!<br /><br />The show itself is great and its refreshing to have a show of vikings not portrayed from comic books, games and movies as guys with horns running around pillaging and raping and drinking mead all day. Instead we got an HBO/Showtime like quality that shows the vikings as disciplined and intelligent people and how Lothbrok began his expansion to the west.  When I say HBO/Showtime like quality, yes, there will be blood and lots of gratuitous violence but sex scenes (thankfully) are kept very softcore.<br /><br />My only con is, in the show, the &#34;oracle&#34; thats an exile, comes off as a transplant from science fiction and not a real oracle that wears black lipstick, casts bones and speaks to the gods. It seemed just off but its not too bad and you don't see this character very often.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next season, as this series is winning my heart faster than Game of Thrones did.
1476729093|5|Hilarious and a page turner. Character is a bit like Monk but not an obsessive compulsive.

0195067142|5|Dr. Sledge wrote that in the slaughtering days of Peleliu there was no sound -- no sound because there was ALL sound, deafening assaults on the ear's physiology.  Of the 9000 Marines who landed on the island's shores, 1 out 7 were dead within 24 hours.  Ocean water was dyed red to 4 feet out.  On shore, and weighted down with 90 pounds of survival gear and weaponry, men ran and fired and fought in 110-degree heat, with no water to drink.  And that was only the beginning.<br />Accounts of organized slaughter abound, from Thucydides' &quot;History of the Peloponnesian Wars&quot; to the Civil War's &quot;Andersonville,&quot; from Leon Uris's factual writings shaped as novels to Canada's Farley Mowat in his 40-years-after-the-war eloquent memoir &quot;And No Birds Sang,&quot; and to Larry Heinemann's wrenching exposures of Viet Nam.  All these writings are unspeakably moving, and when we close the covers, we think we understand ... until we come across a book like that of E.B. Sledge.<br />The accounts of Dr. Sledge touched me immeasurably of their own accord but also because I once loved a casualty of that South Pacific island's horrors, who, unfortunately, never quite found a way back to normalcy.  I was too young and self-involved to comprehend.  As he continued his fateful journey into alcoholism, my own soul stiffened and I left that tortured man.<br />Twenty-six years later I sought out Dr. Sledge, and after some time found a way to reach him.  His words, in a letter to me, ought to be shared.  Dr. Sledge wrote that his physician father offered advice that put Sledge \\"on the road to a postwar life of happiness and success.\\"  Some of the advice was this:  \\"Don't ever feel bitter or sorry for yourself.  You served your time in Hell, but you survived.\\"<br />Survive he did, and well.  Dr. Sledge went on to earn degrees in science and to become \\"Uncle Eugene\\" to his friends on the Alabama campus where he taught biochemistry and zoology.  &quot;Science was my salvation,&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].\\"<br />Read his noble book.  In honoring him, we honor all who have served, and are now serving, the ideals of our country.&quot; he told me. &quot;When combat memories bore down on me I lost myself in a difficult problem [in science].\\"<br />Read his noble book.

B00K25GL7Y|4|You can only draw once per turn and when you still have health left in your minion it all comes back to full but overall it's pretty awsome.
B00ESY7QXI|2|Great book but the movie was disappointing. Music and  many scenes not time appropriate, not well written or directed. Overall I didn't  care much for the movie.
B000TEUSJK|5|A gift that brought a lot of joy.  I would do business with this supplier again.  Keep up the good work!
B00GDT4M1A|5|This Disney classic looks great in the new HD version. Sound is also better on blu-ray.<br /><br />Recommended for all Disney fans, especially fans of the original hand painted animation.
B000JQU1VS|3|As someone before has stated, there are several technical glitches throughout the book, for example in the signature of the letter of the first story, in the word \\"employee\\" as well as in place of (money) values in the second story.. (and that is as far as I have gotten so far). It is highly annoying. I am merely reading the kindle version as a means to pass the time while I wait for a different, annotated version in print to come from the library; I also have another electronic version I can consult every time I come across a glitch of unintelligible symbols (I hate not knowing what they intend to say).    The stories themselves are much shorter than the novels (well duh). I had begun the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes after first reading the annotated versions of a Study in Scarlet then the Sign of Four and find the annotations to be quite helpful at times (albeit excessive at others) - for example, translations are provided for the non-English phrases that Mr. Sherlock Holmes uses.    I absolutely adore the sherlock holmes series <3 and would recommend reading an annotated version if it's your first time with this series - or even if it isnt your first time!
B00005JKGZ|5|A lyrical, nostalgic Valentine to our country at the turn of the century, Director Minnelli brings his flair for color, costumes and setting to create a sumptuous visual treat. Film is extremely nice on the ears too, as young Judy (never more luminous) sings \\"The Trolley Song\\" and \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" and more.  A timeless treat for the whole family.
B0066W1AZK|5|I like chess but I don't like the computer smearing me after 6 moves.  This game allows you to set levels and have a decent chance.
0385720920|1|Not sure why everyone liked this book. I could barely read it be/c it was so weird and yet boring. There was no life to the book the character was so gray and dry. Don't waste your time.
B00BETX5PS|5|I loved the movie, I saw it in the cinema first and decided to re watch it with a friend. The playback quality was flawless and well worth the 5 bucks to enjoy it. Nothing bad to report here.
B0001CCXZW|5|This show is wonderful! I love the relationship between Rory and Lorelai. And the idea of a small town (Stars Hollow, where they live) where everybody knows you, have a diner where you can eat at everyday, adn basically find a place where you can settle down in. I recommend watching the show and reading the books. (On Ft. Lewis it's on Tuesday at 8:00 PM on the WB, you might wanna check your TV guide for other times). When this DVD boxed set comes out, i promise it will be well- spent!
B007IXWKUK|5|This series was not what I had expected based on comments from other readers. Apart from the sensual aspect, you have a well written story of the impact that emotional and physical abuse at an early age can have on a person for the rest of their lives. Loving this trilogy by E.L. James.
0062082353|5|I chose 5 stars because of how well written the book was.  It wasn't what I expected at all, it was better.  I couldn't put it down it was that good.  The author used a lot of humor in describing his life.  I appreciated that he did not apologize for his military career.  He was trained to be a sniper.  He took his job seriously.  He never forgot that the lives of other U.S. military were in his hands and he protected them to the best of his ability.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who &#34;thinks&#34; they know what the book is about.  The author breaks the stereotype of war story books.  Lastly, it is written the way you would imagine he would talk in real life.  I laughed many many times.  Not the kind of emotion you would think a book with this title would create.
075640407X|5|Hello, George R.R., Bob Jordan and Mr. Goodkind! The FIRST volumes of your overlong, multivolume epics remind me of THIS ONE! I guess Mr. Rothfuss has read your works, and decided: \\"Let's get to the point, for crying out loud!\\" <br /> <br />This entertaining and unusual fantasy speeds along--even though much of it takes place in flashbacks. Instead of introducing a new character (or three) every other chapter, the author concentrates on the protagonist, Kvothe. And he is worthy of the attention.  <br /> <br />A legend in his own time, he's hiding out in an obscure inn--but why? A teller of tales locates him unexpectedly...and Kvothe tells him his story. He has three days to tell it, and this first volume is just one day. <br /> <br />This is a lively, engaging, often hilarious, frequently moving story. I highly recommend it to fantasy fans who are ready for something fresh--and not quite so self-indulgent as the 7, 8, 9 volume heavyweights we've been reading. <br /> <br />I pray that Mr. Rothfuss sticks to his principals--and keeps this to three volumes. I hope that the second two are as great as the first!
B009CPES4I|4|Great movie!  My spouse and 15 year old daughter loved it!
B00BAXFECK|4|Well written and engrossing but way too long.  I got tired of reading about all the bouts with drugs and alcohol.  After a while you get the point and I found myself skipping ahead.  Also, two thirds of the way into the book it turns into a action thriller.  Again, well written but too long.<br /><br />On the positive side, I loved the parts about the painting and the symbolism of it.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Amazinggggggggggg
B00578FKVE|4|Much better without commercials, which are a distraction.  This is a great way to watch a television series (or perhaps the only way).
B00P7PJ9P0|4|The would-be king took away her precious gift.  I'd be mad, too! Angelina was great!
B007TNS6JI|5|cant put this game down!! not enough time in the day to play! runs perfect on a kindle fire. lots of content. keep up the good work.
B00B2FLDRQ|5|Witty and spell binding. A romp through the life of a misunderstood person with good friends. Could not put it down. Laughed out loud. Highly recommended.
B002XHN776|5|When people ask me what my desert island album is, I point them straight to &#34;This Is War.&#34;  Without a doubt, this album is an absolute triumph.  Both the writing and the performances are in a class of their own.  Many critical reviews panned this album, saying that its ambition is too much for its execution.  As a fan of progressive rock, a genre that is nothing if not ambitious, I would have to disagree; Leto and company have forged an album that is at once incredibly heartfelt and also one of modern rock's masterpieces.  It holds up to endless repeated listening.  I cannot recommend it enough.
B00GYQYL7W|2|Ok movie, but no real point. It could have been much more interesting if there was some sort of plot.
B00MO21WUE|5|IT AWAS JUST WHAT WE WERE WANTING.
B001VLXNLU|5|It starts out slow, but it gets good fast. You become mesmerized by the mystery and the story Zoey has to tell.
B00H4M3GXK|3|Great movie!
B008QMMEOE|3|This was almost too easy for her. She mastered it quickly, but enjoyed playing it. If your child enjoys puzzle, this game will be great.
B003O86FMW|5|It was a very interesting and fun series!  I cannot wait for this movie to come out.  I am totally excited!
B00BJ9VBLI|2|This is a game that just would not keep my attention. It did take long to download and install and took a pretty nice chunk of space, but the graphics quality makes it all worth it. If you are into using games on your Kindle, by all means, download this game.<br /><br />I am a reader and use my Kindle for a few games and the rest books, so this game just did not fit my needs.
0393324818|5|Amazing piece of sports writing.  Lewis' &#34;Moneyball,&#34; is a tale about how we allow ourselves to be tied to by our own eyes and &#34;support&#34; what we &#34;see&#34; with what we hold as conventional wisdom.  While &#34;Moneyball&#34; focuses on the intersections of baseball, economics and tradition, like baseball as a game, it is in many ways a metaphor for how we live as Americans.  Excellent book!
B000B8QEZG|5|MADONNA IS THE QUEEN!  Do not listen to any of the negative reviews. Just listen, enjoy, and be taken into a world of dance, hope, peace, love, and utter, utter fabulousness... <br /> <br />ALL HAIL THE QUEEN. <br /> <br />
B0044C5SCU|4|Fringe is a good unique show.  I really like the characters they are great.  I am sad that the show ends in Season 5.  A show worth watching.
0670024856|3|I have mixed feelings about this book. I love historical fiction. I also really enjoyed the subject of botany. A subject that I didn't pay enough attention to while in school, but fascinates me now because I'm older, wiser and I do see God's signature in each living thing. Also, I nearly fell off my reading chair when the subject of mosses came up...I mean other than a bryologist, I thought I was the only person to see a whole tiny universe inside a beautiful patch of moss! lol<br /><br />As for the characters...well...not one of them is lovable. I wanted to love Alma, I really did, but I could not and this leads me to my beef with this book.....<br /><br />Why do authors feel they have to include sex to sell a book!?! If the subject is interesting enough and the characters are likable...you really, really don't have to &#34;sex it up.&#34; I understood Alma exploring her &#34;quim&#34; once, but the repeated reference to it was unnecessary (plus, I hate the word &#34;quim&#34;). I found myself saying, &#34;not the binding closet again!&#34; I am not even close to being a prude, but this subplot throughout the whole book was so unnecessary and subtracted from a five-star rating for me. As &#34;they&#34; say, &#34;sex sells&#34;, but I could have done without it in this otherwise well written, albeit long, historical fiction novel.
B0066WJLU6|5|You can change the colors of the light very easily. You can also change how bright the light is very easily! I got this app because my sister uses my reading light, but I have to say this app works much better!!!<br />  P.S. This app works on Kindle Fire's, unlike many other reading<br /> light apps!!!!!!!!!
B00G6ZTM3Y|3|On my Motorola Droid Turbo, Android 5.1, whenever I try to name my character, the keyboard does not accept my input. When I press a key, nothing happens or reacts. This doesn't happen in any other apps. From the tutorial, the game seems fun though and I rate it 3 stars.
B001K3JF7K|5|Love this artist. Have had great service . WOULD RECOMMEND TO OTHERS ANYTIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE GREAT SERVICE
B006LSZECO|4|Fast pace, interesting story but should only take it as a story as I doubt anyone can get away with such a course setup.
B005DD7TI0|5|This movie. Yes. All I've got to say. I'm sure some people wouldn't like it, but they're not the kind of people I want to know.
B0027REDK2|5|I have been looking for an original pressing of Rio on CD for the longest time.  This CD features the alternate mixes of &#34;Rio&#34; &#34;Hungry Like The Wolf&#34;, and &#34;Hold Back The Rain&#34;.  My only gripe (if you can call it a gripe) is that the so-called &#34;Carnival&#34; and &#34;Night&#34; remixes weren't cleaned up a little bit better than they were.  Otherwise, acoustic version of &#34;The Chauffeur&#34; was an excellent surprise as well as some of the other alternate mixes of the songs.  Again, if you are a DD fan and are on the fence about buying, DO NOT HESITATE!!
B001BPJJ82|5|If you're looking for a movie to show off your blu ray player to others (or yourself) this is the one! The cinematography alone is worth the purchase. Visually stunning and  simply put, it's candy for the eyes. The story may be too simple for some and bit much in the way of fantasy for others, but I really enjoyed it. Overall, it's a movie you'll find yourself watching again and again because of it's innocence and beauty.<br /><br />I happened to stumble upon this movie a month ago, renting it from netflix on blu ray....I was blown away. I literally smiled with enjoyment through the majority of the film, feeling as though I was watching something very different and special, in the way of movies. I don't know how I missed hearing anything about this movie, it has flown under the radar for over 3 years.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, get your popcorn ready and be prepared to be totally satisfied with this visual treat.
B007SGLZP8|3|The story line is OK, but not great.  I don't think this book isn't very realistic like his other books.
0446560065|5|I really enjoyed. I can't stop laughing. In some situations Simon's cat reminds me to my 4 cats. Nice job!.    A nice book for any cat lover.
B001EA4M7M|4|I have watched every version and I always find something I like about them, this version has Eliza bennettsthought verballized when she realizes ser own pride and prejudices are at play with the way she behave all other versions you know when she reads Darcy's letter that she at least begins to see herself through a more realistic viewpoint.
B007THA4FI|5|I thought is was fab - i real snapshot of life in an English Town, it had me in tears..............for all the Weedon families out there...........
B0042816YK|5|I read the book first & was told to not watch the movie but I so enjoyed the book I was curious. Knowing that any movie about a book can merely be but I simple interpretation I really enjoyed the movie. People bashed it but I believe it's because they had expectations instead of going into the movie with an open mind knowing the movie is just about entertainment. It's not in my top all time greatest films but I was entertained so mission accomplished!
B00006ADD5|5|Great seller, will use again.
B00005B36H|5|tool's fourth album, lateralus, could create a new significate for the word \\"perfection\\". this album contains all the instances for the perfect prog-metal album, but contains also a lot of psichedelic patterns.  <br />\\"The Grudge\\" is the first song of the album. the riff of guitar is repeated all along the eight minutes of the song, and maynard explains how the grudge could be an obstacle to throw away. the scream at the end of the song show us all the anger repressed. <br />\\"eon blue apocalypse\\" is related with \\"the patient\\". here maynard <br />explains how life can be hard to live, but everything have a significate.  <br />after \\"mantra\\", comes \\"schism\\", real poetry. maynard shows how can be difficult the life of two lovers that can't reach each other.  <br />then, here who listen to the following songs can disappear. <br />parabol/parabola is a song that talks about two persons that make love, with all their hearts. parbol is soft, lounge, and make the sensation of life, with the guitar that crawls slowly into your skin.  <br />parabola is the explosion of love, of passion. but it's not finished. <br />if parabol/parabola, is the passion, \\"ticks and leeches\\" is the rage. this songs is the sand in your mouth, the blood that you wanna suck from your enemies, the world that you wanna flush away. the guitars are evil, and the patterns of the drums are impossible. they describe the rush.  <br />then here comes the power. \\"lateralus\\", probably the best song of the album, talks about the sense of life, the way you're choosing to live, the power that surrounds you in every minute of your life. this song is mathematic: the verse is divided with the \\"fibonacci's sequence\\", and search the perfection of everything.  <br />after the final D minor of lateralus, there is one song divided in three parts: disposition, reflection and triad. these songs talks about the searching for yourself, and if you have find yourself you are at the end of the travel.  <br />faip de oiad is thefinal song of the album and shows how the governements of the world can control the human race like aliens. <br />this is simply the best album of the new century, and this travel into soul and return makes TOOL the best band of the world.
B001NLKWLW|5|This was one of the best books I have ever read. The characters are intriguing and the plot so wise. Kate Morton is a wonderful writer. I have recommended this book to everyone I know.
B00CM9JKQM|5|Love this release and hope the next one will be even better! Long live QR! This release gives me a mainline rush to believe there's more QR brilliance to come. REBIRTH!!
B00FAPF5U0|5|Lots of fun and frustration at the same time. Very addictive!! Love playing. Just wish you'd get more lives in less amount of time.
B00957T6X6|4|I really enjoyed these books. Can't wait for the next volume. Left me hanging ,wanting to know what happens next.
B00785P2QC|5|I love this game so much it is awesome It has great view<br />would u like or love this game cause I do
B001ACH4DS|5|\\"Gutsy and epic, but grounded in the personal, the songs are tailor-made for those magical moments when music, whether it be uplifting or heart-breaking, can transport you to another place, which is exactly what Cook intended.\\"    Every song on this CD is excellent!
B001TH16DI|5|All the great classics, I love these movies, great package deal. Amazon is great to work with, Star Trek 2 wrath of Khan and the latest Star Trek movie make nice tie together
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is super fun but there are a few flaws like it freezes sometimes but this game is really fun
B009O2XY12|5|This game is really addiction because you just want to keep going and wanting to beat how far you got the time before
B00HBQWGXK|2|The plot dragged and the action was contrived. But out of loyalty to the author, I stayed with it to the bitter end. I hope his next book is better or he will lose me as a fan.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I loved it great work makers and cool tunes I recommend it to anyone of any age
B0094BB4TW|5|My daughter has this on her ipod so when she got her Kindle Fire, she had to have it on there as well!  Loves having the app on a larger screen!
B004FGMDOQ|5|I thought this book was amazeballs. I'm very eager to read the second one. I loved the weird suspenseful photographs
B00A8ECU24|1|My daughter has played this game for a few months. It has numerous glitches and if you want to get some of the more popular ponies it can cost quite a bit! While you can play for free it very disheartening at the ridiculous cost to get buy gems.  It would literally take you years of free play to earn enough gems for some of the more expensive ponies.  Not to mention that we've spent money to get gems & now since the most recent Gameloft update the game does not load at all anymore.  Not happy..would definitely not ever spend money on another Gameloft Game.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Watch it two times. Thrilling and full of suspense. Love watching handsome aging Tom Cruise. My teenagers loved it to.
B00DZ83IPS|5|Well written and great characters
B0085PFG1U|5|Good calc app
B00003CXE7|5|For starters, I loved the movie when it was in theaters so it should be no surprise that I love the DVD.  The opening battle scene is phenominal and the transfer to DVD is amazing.  From the dark opening scenes in Germania to the beauty of the city of Rome--the cinematography is breathtaking.  Russel Crowe is perfect as Maximus, he is a great actor in a career defining role.  While he kicked but and took names in L.A. Confidential, he simply annihilates everything in his path as Maximus; while earning the respect of his soldiers as a general and peers as a slave turned gladiator turned hero.<br />Joaquin Phoniex did a fine job as the revolting Caesar who cries and whines for respect he does not deserve.  All of the actors were great and the film from beginning to end is truly a masterpiece of modern filmmaking.  The spiritual framing sequences of Maximus in the the wheat (?) were a nice touch as well.  The only thing holding back from a 5 stars is the movie was a little slow at times.<br />An adrenaline pumping heart wrenching story.  If you own a DVD player, buy this DVD.  If you don't own a DVD Player-buy one just so you can appreciate this amazing DVD.
B00J7UL6V6|5|The Black Keys are an interesting band. They aren't afraid to change up their sound from record to record. I've been a fan since their first record and ever since those early records it seems that they love to change it up and give the fans something new. I will give a warning to new fans, if you only became a fan off of El Camino, you might be disappointed. That was a very catchy, radio friendly record, and there is nothing wrong with that. But the Black Keys have stated that they wanted to make an old school headphones record. I found that to be very true. This is a record meant to be listened to on Vinyl with a pair of headphones. Not ear buds, not MP3s but an actual Vinyl record with headphones. Some really good guitar and some nice throwbacks to their bluesier early days. Overall it's one of my favorite records of 2014 and Turn Blue fits perfectly within their catalog.
B00R2LZ41K|1|I was eager to see the third movie in the series, and I planned to buy the extended version of all three as soon as they became available.<br /><br />On the plus side, there's at least one good scene. Also, when the actors are allowed to act, they are excellent. Quite a lot of the material was based on Tolkien. And even some of the departures from Tolkien had potential for being very good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie doesn't work. The pacing is bad, the timing is off, the special effects are silly, and although a few of the departures from the book are enriching, most add nothing and are so pointless or unbelievable that they seem like slapstick.<br /><br />The Battle of the Five Armies made the story so overblown, trite, and silly that I won't be buying the set. And that makes me sad.
B0000508U6|5|Normally a band's first album has a few good songs and a bunch of leftovers making up the rest of the disc. It takes a truly special group to produce a complete CD the first time around. And that's exactly what Parachutes is.<BR>Many of you will look at this CD and judge it solely for &quot;Yellow&quot; (I've heard Parachutes called &quot;Yellow and Eleven Other Songs&quot; before!), but each song has its merit and holds its place. Two years on, and of all the discs in my collection, this is the one that I come back to and rediscover consistently every couple of months.<BR>I'd have to count &quot;We Never Change&quot;, &quot;Don't Panic&quot; and &quot;Everything's Not Lost&quot; as my favourites, but I could almost say that about all of them. To produce a bunch of songs like this on the first try is testament to Coldplay's talent.
B00634GHJA|5|Transfers photos and videos from my Galaxy S5 to my Mac very fast.

B00DPM7TIG|4|I thought this was a very good book. It held my interest and had some good information.
B00MHT49KO|5|More serious and less child oriented.
B00LP1MVSW|4|Great game, nags too often to add a review. They are a bit too aggressive to squeeze money out for extra gameplay. Just charge four bucks and be done with it!
B00RVBY8KO|1|Did not care for it.
B009OYTAL8|4|One of my favorite things are cheesy, predictable, super heroes. As an added bonus, I can watch this with my kids.
B002BI6SMI|5|I saw this movie in the theatre and knew immediately that I was going to own it. Good acting, great gritty dialogue and excellent casting made this exciting to watch and see Liam kick some bad guy butt!<br /><br />The BD quality is great, sound is crisp and visuals are stunnning as you would expect. I waited for this to go on sale and it arrived promptly 2 days later thanks to Amazon Prime.
B004UJTG6Q|3|All-time classic.  Have to read at least some of it.  Dialect is really hard to read through but you get use to it.  Elements are so pervasive in our culture that you know everything already before you read it.  So kind of boring.
B0049D1TCM|5|i started with nicki in the mix tape era. i love her animated rap style and flow. tis album though reminds me of nicki being rihanna and nicki. i dig her singing voice even though its not that strong. i really hope the next album she goes back to that old nicki so we can hear what she does on her guest spots
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book was amazing me being the reader I am I got attached to the characters I laughed cried and raged with them Augustus reminds me of a special guy in my life I can relate to this book in so many ways I highly suggest this book to all readers it's amazing okay? Okay
B002PMV9K6|5|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that as Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds, Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven. Harry suspects perils may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague Horace Slughorn, who he believes holds crucial information. Even as the decisive showdown looms, romance blossoms for Harry, Ron, Hermione and their classmates. Love is in the air, but danger lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.  What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
B000HEWEJO|5|Was so happy to find this on dvd.  This is a must for Christmas.  Sadly, they are not showing these old movies on tv anymore and this is a gem for the season.  This and &#34; A Christmas Carol&#34; with Alastair Sim,  make Christmas old fashioned.. Purchased both movies through the same company and they came quickly and packaged well..
B0002EXH5E|5|A very good album. I lost my first copy. This one is better. A very difficult album to find. A very good example of his early work.
1400069742|5|Most of the books I've read on World War II generally focus on the combat battles that occurred throughout Europe and Asia. Those Angry Days by Lynne Olson is the first book I've ever seen that goes into comprehensive detail about the internal debate that occurred throughout the United States between 1939-1941.<br /><br />While the central figures on the front cover are FDR and Charles Lindbergh, they are merely the key figures that represented two sides of the interventionist-isolationist debate as war raged throughout Europe. This battle across the country from the stage of Broadway to the cornfields of the Midwest and everywhere in between. Groups representing both viewpoints would eventually engage in violent clashes on America's street corners. The interventionist-isolationist debate divided the country in a way not seen since the days of the American Civil War.<br /><br />Lynne Olson tells the story of a country divided and the vocal and impassioned personalities on both sides. With an intense eye for detail and the unique gifts of a master storyteller, the author puts the reader squarely in the middle of the United States circa 1941. I was so engrossed by the book that I couldn't put it down and focus on my graduate seminar. Every person depicted in the book is drawn in such great detail that the reader feels as though they are being subjected to the venomous attacks of the interventionists and isolationists.<br /><br />One of my favorite books of 2013.
B000088E6P|4|I've been a 50 fan since he first dropped. Not last year but way back in '98 when he dropped How To Rob. I didn't forget about him when he got shot 9 times. I was just waiting for him to back stronger than ever, which he has. I'm not gonna front and say he is one of the best of all-time, cuz he's not. He's not one of the best lyrically either. But there's something about 50 that makes him such an entertaining rapper. He is clever and has potential to go down as a rapper everyone will remember. (example: \\"Shorty, I been watchin you watchin me/ Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me\\" from 'U Not Like Me') <br />I've had this album before it dropped in February and it's still in rotation in my stereo. We've all heard Wanksta, In Da Club and 21 Questions by now but there's much more on this album to talk about. Personally, I feel the whole album is bangin except for two songs and the intro. Wanksta is real annoying now, but I guess I can listen to it sometimes still. Gotta Make It To Heaven is hot lyrically, but that beat really annoys the hell outta me. <br />I own every G-Unit song ever released (underground or mainstream) and I think 50 should have used G-Unit members Tony Yayo and Lloyd Banks a little more. They really have potential to be big in this game. Lloyd Banks ripped it on Don't Push Me, and Eminem did too. What Up Gangsta is a song for all them cats on tyhe street to bump in their cars. Many Men and Heat are probably my favorite tracks on the CD. High All The Time is a good song to bump when your blazin a fatty. Back Down is a hot diss track to Ja Rule. The beef goes back quite a while, not just right before Ja dropped his latest flop. That's when Ja actually decided to open his mouth about 50, tryna promote his album cuz 50 was catchin fire in the streets at the time. If I Can't, Blood Hound and P.I.M.P. are real hot songs. Poor Lil Rich is a hot song with a pretty sick beat and even hotter lyrics. The bonus tracks are old songs 50 was supposed to release back in the day but didn't cuz he lost his deal after he got shot. These tracks (U Not Like Me & Life's On The Line)are straight fire. Not many people really knows that Life's On The Line is an older Ja Rule diss, going back to the days when Ja was tryna say he beat the sh*t outta 50 with a baseball bat. <BR>Listen to the song, you can tell who it's about. Below is my track rating (1-5): <br />1. Intro -- Not rated since its like 7 seconds of a coin droppin<BR>2. What Up Gangsta -- 5<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem) -- 4.5<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death) -- 5<BR>5. In Da Club -- 4 <BR>6. High All the Time -- 4<BR>7. Heat -- 5<BR>8. If I Can't -- 5<BR>9. Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck) -- 5<BR>10. Back Down -- 4.5<BR>11. P.I.M.P. -- 5<BR>12. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo) -- 5<BR>13. Poor Lil Rich -- 5<BR>14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg) -- 4.5<BR>15. Don't Push Me (feat. Lloyd Banks & Eminem) -- 5<BR>16. Gotta Make It to Heaven -- 5<BR>17. Wanksta -- 3<BR>18. U Not Like Me --5 <BR>19. Life's On The Line -- 5<br />If you like the 'gangsta' songs on the album or U Not Like Me and/or Life's On The Line, peep 50's 'Guess Who's Back'. That's an album which is basically the greatest street hits of 50. It's also the album that Eminem heard and gained interest in 50. Then he decided to sign him and now Shady Records ALMOST gives Death Row a run for its money for the label with the most talent at one time.
B000XUBFE2|5|The movie and the book were Well written and displayed  terrific acting. Other than a somewhat confusing charcter description introducing the book,  once into the story it was spell binding. It helped by seeing the movie previously. The young actress deserves recognition.
B00632HWOG|5|Will always use Yahoomail!
1476733953|4|A very enjoyable read! Lent it to my sister as soon as I was finished!
B0085A9HXS|5|Wow.  This movie went and messed everything up.  It is the standard on which I will judge all action/kung-fu movies off of.  Not much of a plot or character developement, but that's ok.  A+
B001HNE3NO|5|I thought this book was a great read and a great insight to events that happened so long ago.  Would definitely recommend this.
1107699894|5|Perfect for advanced level
1451666179|4|3.5 really, good for a chuckle, but you can't read more than one story without needing to put it down. Funny but short lived.
B003WUYRGI|4|Only got to preview a few pages so far. Will furnish more review later. Can't seem to get pass the requirement for a review before I agent  to view the book
B009FZHYKU|5|If at first glance the title screams 'cheesy zombie flick'... Think again! This was the surprise of the year for me; a gritty, intense drama with complex character development. Set aside a few hours to start your Walkingdeadathon!
B0071XO8RA|5|WOW!  Hugh should definitely get paid more for his work.  This series of stories is not your average reading material, but top notch!  I rate this with the Harry Potter series and I cannot believe I only paid $4.99 for this.  I could not put the book down and felt great anxiety having to go to bed or work instead of reading Wool.  Awesome book!
B005PK57IK|5|Awesome!
B008M721MS|5|It works everywhere and keeps me in contact with my friends. I love Skype
1594200823|5|A book containing easy,delightful facts,that anyone can understand.and realize,put into what is required in our daily consumptaton of food.
B00BD99JMW|2|the writing style completely differs from the other two books.  It goes off course for a bit but does a nice job piecing everything together.  A little disappointing ending to a very good series of books.
B00008EYA5|5|Really good action movie - very good acting!!
B002QE3CTY|5|Forget Hunger Games. Think more along the lines of Michael J. Sullivan or Brandon Sanderson as to epic. A teenager arrives in a box with nearly no memory of the past. He is a greenbean, a newby and treated as if, not knowing the score, any speech with him is wasted air. After a short time he finds few like it there and everyone there is hoping a team of runners will figure out the huge maze surrounding the camp. 2 years and not a clue how to get out. Everything is about order and our hero, Thomas, sweats disorder. This has already been optioned for a movie and there have been 3 other books in the series (1 a prequel). I have liked a lot of the new \\"end of the world\\" novels but this one is in a class by itself. I hope you take the opportunity to read this book. You will probably get the other 3 as soon as you finish this one. I am...shu
B00BAXFACO|5|This one was definitely a  different twist than most of the Lincoln Lawyer books.  I don't think second ending was needed.
B003HZW26U|5|Such an easy book to read.  So raw and bare.  Yet so sophiscated in reaching the depth of emotion. I laughed.  I cried. I let my own emotions and inhibitions go. I was very thankful that I live by myself but nothing more than to share the experience.  Gotta buy a couple for friends.
B009UX2YAC|5|Very fun and addictive.
B007SGLZP8|5|Great author , great story
B003H9MSPG|3|This item was OK. I knew this item was used but the box was kind of old and the Nerf shot gun wasnt in the box it was in a separate box and it did not fit in its original box.
B000FCK65W|5|I can see why this is a classic.  This is a very compelling story and so authentic.  I couldn't put it down and wondered how it took me so long to find this book.
B000006MV8|5|I had forgotten how good a group Badfinger was.  Breaking Bad brought them back into my music world and I'm very happy with the amount of songs and the songs themselves.
B00CW665VI|5|I'm serious. Stop reading this review. You don't need to weigh this decision. Just buy the book and read it already. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />This is the kind of book you read and go 'Damn, I wish I could write like that'. It's sweet and hilarious and sexy. Drew is a fantastic POV character. Kate is just...<br /><br />Why are you still reading this review? You're wasting time. BUY THIS BOOK. READ IT. THE END.
B000067CIJ|5|Better Than You Might Expecyt!
B003G7164S|5|This isn't just a rock album, it is a rock symphony.  No one makes music like this anymore.  I think the original pressing may sound a tad more dynamic, but it has so many quiet passages its hard to find one clean enough.  Doesn't disappoint at all.
B000UZQI0Q|5|So many twists and turns! This book was wonderful.  It hurt every time I had to put it down.  Onto the third!
B000002HFU|5|This cd is the real sh!t. All the tracks in here are awesome, i have many classic cd's in my caSe, but this cd is very different, all these beats are crazy thanx to the rza, u also have appearances by method, gza, and raekwon te chef. the best song in here is drunk game(sweet sugar pie) because ODB tries to sing R&amp;B.... 1 of tHe best wu tang cd's and of all time, best cover of all time also. FREE ODB
B00BBQXQFI|5|I was bummed I did not get to see this in the theater - but we downloaded it from Amazon Prime and watched it the other day and loved it. What a cool concept - both my husband and our kids really enjoyed this.
B0013D69YE|1|I was actually at home a few weeks ago, and discovered I bought this cd when I was a freshman in HS. I was like why would I buy that? I remembered I bought the cd because I used to be a huge Destiny's Child fan when i was a kid,but then I got older.Then i remembered thinking in the walmart cd section,well if i liked destiny's child years earlier then this cd might be good. To be quite honest. I thought Crazy in love, the video had a good look to it. The song sucked. Baby Boy was stupid. Pure crap to me, and very annoying. I actually thought her cover of Donna Summer's Love to Love you Baby was ok.(Naughty GirL). Me Myself and I was decent, but same old same old. I really just got to tired of Beyonce's sound at that point. It was to overplayed and not that good. Her duet with Luther Vandross was classy and He's a legend. It was good(the duet), but it wasn't worth paying almost 20 bucks at the time(remember this is when cd's were trying to justify their high prices). If your a huge Beyonce Fan this get this album. Personally, i thought it was too safe and not gritty enough. I liked her recent release way better.
B00WIO0LRI|5|Great game, personally the Best of the three.
B00GTCECVG|5|Dozens name b-day to have been demeaned and acknowledgement the Kingdom and acknowledgement of the kindle name is C.dingo to be respected in this manner of you can she update to have to be racially and I have a seat on
B004JHYRDQ|4|It's a scifi classing by a Grand master.  A must read for anyone who wants to understand his influence on science fiction.
0140120416|5|Just starting out in this language. Along side my coaches, this book is an excellent companion.
B008MU8ZNO|5|good move on dvd but the blu ray was relly good update cant what to see if there is a part 2 comeing out
B0050DIWFC|5|I have never given 5 stars to any book.  Totally engulfed  with the story line.  It lingers with you.
B00J4S4EWO|5|:)
B006SV2LWA|4|I love a good plague movie.
B000SUKPKM|5|I hate it when people think these reviews are about 1) the service they got from the seller or shipper, 2) the unique physical defect that the casing for their product may have, like a crack, but does not affect the content of the product and they let their overall rating of the item reflect this although they love the item to the max! 3) think that the songs for this &#34;greatest hits&#34; album were necessarily put in order of greatness, with no.1 being the best and moving down the ranks as you go... Can't you see that it's a general compilation dude??? and that they've placed the track in a logical order for a nice track to track flow for the listener, while at the same time saving some of the best for last??? Smh...<br /><br />What I do like are fair reviews that really review the item itself. Not everyone has to love the album like me, but I understand why these people give a less than the maximum rating based on their logical comments, and I appreciate that. I agree with a former comment that says that this album is misunderstood by many and not for the die hard, hard core, world tour Goo fans who know tons of other band hits, other than what's reached the radio. This album is more for the avid radio listening Goo fan... after all the title of the album does specify &#34;The Singles&#34;... so what do you expect? Anyway, that's my 2 cents and just know that I love the album and think that it's a great compilation. Take care. Later!
0486266885|4|Missing some introductory material found in prior versions.
B00AKEMHCA|5|I've loved the Bloos TD series since it started, and this keeps the tradition going. Lots of options, lots of strategy - but still fun enough for kids to enjoy and have a blast with.
B0060MYM7O|5|INCREDIBLY fast shipping! I got my box set within 3-4 DAYS of ordering!! Very impressed by the care that was taken into making sure my box set arrived safely without damage in transit! Everything was as depicted in the description, no problems whatsoever. All in all, it was a great buy, especially since it was on sale. Incredibly fast shipping and beautiful all around! :^) Thanks so much!
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is very affordable and challenging. There is a lot of characters to collect. My top score is 210. I Love this game
B009ZM74F8|2|I think the writer of this movie must have watched 1984, Pink Floyd The Wall, Logan's Run, THX 1138, The Matrix and Ultraviolet and then decided to compress them into one movie. If you want to save some time, watch Equilibrium. But if you want to watch better movies, watch the 'originals'.
B005LAIISA|4|This product came in fine but like it always seems now dvd cases are crappy and this one was. They all have the recycle symbol on them-are we really gonna recycle them? I personally use dvd cases. Anyway dvd came in fine.
B008XG1X18|5|I'm addicted to it. I use it all the time when I'm bored. there's so many things to look at and I like organizing my thoughts with pictures.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Sanderson is an excellent author. This book has an excellent story line, the characters are well told. Cannot wait for the next book.
B0000WN0VY|3|Just to set the record straight. I have the CD/DVD Limited Edition and I am reviewing this as a whole - as presented according to it's price and the music contents.<br /><br />Damien Rice is one of those singers with a distinctive voice. And when you listen to his music, you realize it is a perfect match. His music is classified as Folk. Some people go so far as stating his music his beyond genre, but that's just pushing it. I believe it is Alternative/Contemporary Folk.<br /><br />If you bought this album, you obviously appreciate these kinds of music genre. If you've heard of him only because of the trailer from \\"Closer\\", that's exactly the kind of music you will get from the whole album. It isn't pop. And that's a good thing. I appreciate all kinds of music, but I am awed at artists from their respective genres who can create outstanding albums that separate it from the rest of the pack.<br /><br />In this case, \\"o\\" is one of those instances. I don't really buy these kinds of music, but I gave notice at his album more than a year ago at Virgin Megastore when it was being sold for USD9.99. I gave a listen and couldn't put the headphones down.<br /><br />For me, \\"Volcano\\" is still the best track in this album. It is here thaat you will give notice to the vocals of Lisa Hannigan and the cello by Vyvienne Long. \\"The Blower's Daughter\\", which was given notice due to the trailer of the movie \\"Closer\\". It is also the reason why the same album is now being sold for USD18.99 at most music stores and USD13.99 at Amazon. Anyway, as he sings until the end \\"...I can't take my mind off you...\\" he continues to say it until the very end like a person really in longing.<br /><br />But from track 1 alone, \\"Delicate\\" you are instantly sucked in the world of the artist and you can feel the songs he and his fellow bandmates play. Go ahead and listen on and \\"Cannonball\\" is another great song.<br /><br />Best to listen with professional studio monitor speakers and/or quality headphones like Sennheiser brands. Why? So you can hear the subtelty of the instruments and vocals.<br /><br />All in all the content (songs) is rated 5 STARS out of 5.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />DVD<br /><br />Now on to the whole price and packaging Limited Edition label. That's the reason why it's rated 3 stars. Why sell it at that price? The DVD doesn't contain anything except 3 videos from AOL sessions - \\"Cannonball\\", \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" and \\"Volcano\\".<br /><br />The videos are shot perfectly, just like the songs. It is in black and white and recorded live. The three most important people in the album are the only ones playing - Damien Rice, vocals and guitar; Lisa Hannigan, vocals; Vyvienne Long, cello.<br /><br />Most people will not notice it, but the compression of the videos aren't that good as it seems. There are artifacting. For a DVD with only three video contents, they could have processed this at a higher bit rate. The space is there on the disc already, why waste it.<br /><br />I would also appreciate if this was processed in DTS (doesn't have to be surround sound), but that would allow a higher audio quality than the Dolby 2.0 it was compressed in.<br /><br />The DVD contents size is 788.1MB out of a possible 4.7GB for one side. You get the idea.<br /><br />Also on the disc, when you click on the web site link it will tell you that there \\"contains a ROM section with links to more information and content...simply insert the disc into the DVD-ROM drive, open the ROM folder and double-click the weblink.html file.\\" So I did. I clicked on the html file and it opened my browser and brought me to the web page of the artist. Huh? That's it. No special link or feature to say \\"thanks for buying this more expensive edition.\\" None. It's just one small html file to bring me to his front web page. Why not just tell me in the first place to go to [...] It's as easy as that than going to the ROM folder and opening the file and...It just makes the buyer feel stupid. You don't need to treat us like that. We know a special feature when we see one. And this isn't one of them.<br /><br />The DVD rating is 1 STAR out of 5. This, and the ridiculous pricing, is the reason why this whole so-called limited edition package is only 3 STARS.<br /><br />Yes, the DVD packaging is cool. It is definitely apart from the plastic CD cases on shelves. The cover has a nice texture and it looks like a small photo album. Inside are a few pages of original artwork illustrations with hand-written lyrics that I can't barely read. On the last page b+w photos in thumbnail sizes - best to be kept for the bandmates to enjoy.<br /><br />The CD and DVD, disappointingly is packaged and STUFFED in one normal white envelope. After all this great packaging, they finally run out of ideas and just paste the envelope in the end page and and put a white divider (the same material as the envelope) to separate the CD and DVD. So thanks to that ingenious packaging, you have to carefully remove either one unless you are like the rest who just grabs a CD/DVD by your fingers and oil the whole playing side. And then you wonder why there are scratches and skips after a while. Hmm.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />The DVD should be given free for Heaven's sake! There is nothing special or limited about it that it doesn't deserve the price. There are tons of albums with included DVDs already and they have the audacity to sell this for USD4.50 more. To think the original price of this Limited Edition is USD21.98. Imagine that if it was actually sold at that price level. Gosh.<br /><br />For the sake of fans and people who want to discover the artist, scrap the normal album and sell this at the lowest price possible.<br /><br />The videos can be downloaded and viewed online. So don't waste your money unless you are into limited editions. You don't need the DVD to enjoy all the great songs available either way. Buy the cheaper album which contains the exact songs and enjoy the music the artist has to offer then come back and rate it 5 STARS.<br /><br />Hope this helps.The DVD rating is 1 STAR out of 5.

B00BQ1D7X4|5|Good tunes. Love.
B008383GE8|5|An absolutely brilliant book from a brilliant man. It was highly informative and was not confusing for me at all. Understandable and a brilliant read.
B004HY86WE|5|Good plot for intelligent people and lots of action for the men:)
B006MW3UZW|5|I love period pieces and this fits the bill. Drama, suspense, twists and turns. What's not to love? The grandmothers take the show to the next level! They are hilarious!
B006AZZPCM|3|This is a really good item, reasonably priced, purchased from a great vendor.
B009FB3XTA|5|I have all the soundrtacks and this one is terrific, i read some of the other reviews, and was suprised when a few people gave it a low rating....A++++++ all the way! Shipment was really fast and the price was perfect...thanks so much ! ;)
B00005MP58|5|This mini-series is one of the best I've seen in acting, performance, music and scenery and the best version of Pride & Prejudice available.  It is well done from start to finish and every minute of the 6 hours is necessary to tell the whole story.  I recently saw the 2006 big screen version with Keira Knightley and while it was good and she did a fine job acting, the movie was very rushed.  They jammed far too much material into the 3 hours but left out parts that needed to story to flow better.  I like the A & E version much, much better and it still has fine acting and captures the essence of the book and also captures that time period in England extremely well.
B00000IZOR|2|The string connecting the red telephone piece to the phone itself is like 5 inches long, and any child has to either hold the whole phone to their ear or lean down to it to &#34;answer&#34; it. Its cute and sturdy, though ineffective in its soul purpose.
0307277887|5|5 stars, love this book, had to buy it. Glad I have the second book, so I can start reading! Thanks!
B0076DELIG|5|What can I say.  I am a sucker for Harry Bosch novels.  This one is less analizing of Harry and more story.
0439023483|5|Great book.  Seriously, great.  I won't go into a description, but I would recommend this: DO NOT READ A LOT OF DESCRIPTIONS BEFORE READING THIS BOOK.  I think descriptions of this book give away way too much of the book.  If you can, don't read any at all.  Makes the book that much better.    This is a good book.  It moves at a good pace -- not too fast, not too slow.  It has adventure, suspense, futuristic settings, turmoil, personal pain, overcoming, a bit of romance -- but a GOOD amount of romance; there isn't so much you are rolling your eyes and there's just enough romance to make you wonder what will happen with the characters.  I can't stand a book that portrays love as sappy and filled with really sappy vocabulary; this book does not.  It makes you wonder what is going to happen next.  I can't wait for the next book.    I'd also say this book works for both guys and gals -- it is written from a girl's perspective, but it isn't girly.      Also, I'd say that this book really isn't for anyone under the age of 10 or so.  It's got some violence in there.  Some of it is a bit disturbing but definitely necessary to the plot.  I really think it is more of a book for the 15ish + crowd.    Do yourself a favor, pick up this book and read it.  Get yourself or your young adult daughters hooked on it.  This is MUCH better than the crap known as Twilight.
B00CWY76CC|3|I found this to be an entertaining game of logic and puzzles.  Well worth the time.
140120841X|5|graphic novel ever written, in my humble opinion. That said I don't love the artwork. If you love the movie, you must read this. You just must. If you do not, you suck. /topic

B00PB5AO4G|5|Been playing for a couple of years.  Always a challenge.  No silly constant ads. Worth getting any time and constantly entertaining.
B00F35BV64|3|An enjoyable evening, good movie but not up to the standard of previous episodes. Helps to know the early movies.
B00A2XU9IS|5|This is a fun app. You will like it if you tested it out . It will keep you guessing on what is going to be happening for the next day or days to come. Keep up the good work on making more app. Thank you and have fun.

B00G9B1MEM|5|I like it! It is a good way to kill time and fun to watch all those little guys run.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Excellent!
B00D2JDNQ4|4|This novel starts slowly but soon draws you in - once I was about 100 pages in, I found it hard to put down. I do think though that it could have been edited down a bit - it wasn't as tightly written as some of the other Booker winners in recent years.
B001J2WNE4|5|One of my favorite albums
B0089LOG02|5|Not knowing what as t to expect this writer portrayed inside the story some of the trials of being an orphan in multiple timelines tugging at the heart while rewarding the 'reader.
1589949811|4|First impressions (pre-play) were high quality art and lots of pieces to lose! 3 types of tokens, several card sets and even some assembly - makes for a complicated game. After taking a few phases/rounds I realized I would need to read the manual again.<br />And again... and again lol. READ the manual, or you will find this game impossible to learn (correctly). It does leave lots of room for house rules but I recommend playing by the book ASAP, or expansions will just get more complicated when and because you are cheating!<br /><br />The Core sets scenarios leave a little to be desired, but since there are SO many expansions and extras I think that won't be true later on. The cards included are easily used in a decent deck, even a hybrid deck very quickly once you learn the game and how it plays out. Only 30 cards for each sphere honestly is a little short, especially since many of them are filler cards or take other cards that don't come in the set to be valuable, making only about 20 cards worth having. The scenario cards are much better than the player cards, which is why you need to learn to play, because random awesomeness is still better than surgical stupidity.<br /><br />We got pounded the first game, mostly because we played like crap and to be expected didn't know what we were doing. Second game we polished strat and read the manual... again and then again, then took some junk out of the deck and then by the 4th/5th game it was actually easy for the first scenario. Once I got the hang of it I could solo it with a hybrid deck by the 6th/7th game so you will need some patience. You will get smashed the first few times.<br /><br />In the end I would love to have this game be adaptable as PvP instead of just cooperative, so you could play it both ways if you wanted.<br />Anyone with some imagination could pull it off, and I plan to when I get bored with encounters BUT having a standard rule set for such play would have been icing on the cake, so everyone wouldhave to agree on what changes to make in playing PvP with a co-op-LCG game.<br /><br />Overall, add a couple small bags/pouches for the tokens, couple more bags for the separate player decks  maybe even each scenario and I'd be perfectly satisfied even paying 10$ more. I hope to see a deluxe set soon too, with better quality pieces, maybe with some plastic, even tin/aluminum stamped tokens. That would be superb. A deck box wouldn't be bad either...
B000QRIGLC|5|When you start feeling sorry for yourself just pick up this book.<br /><br />Starbucks and iPhones seem so petty when you read what these men faced.
B000000W5L|1|After finding out that it wouldn't play on 6 different computers in the office in my car CD player and in the clock radio on my desk, I contacted to manufacturer that said it is not supposed to play on computers or some older CD players and it is the way it is and no they will not send me one that will! Really ruined the whole experience of hearing this CD again:(
B0049J0DC8|5|N/a. This movie was awesome my lil girl loved and thought is was amazing to watch. The rental idea is great
B00I3C1T7K|3|Robert Duvall makes a great villain.
B008BU75IQ|5|Great page turner.  I am a huge Jeffrey Archer fan.  Hope it is not a long  wait for the next &#34;CLIFTON CHRONICALS&#34;!
B001HM1PFO|5|I am sorry but this movie is so bad it is good.  I have a goofy time watching it because of the campiness and over the top acting/singing/dancing!  The Blu-ray of the 35 Anniversary of TRHPS has both the US and UK versions.  It also contains the option to watch the first part in B./W which was the original intention.  The disk also allows you to karaoke the songs with and without the music singing with you.  There are other features but I have not been through them yet.  Great Blu-ray at a great price!!
B00KQFP5GS|5|This movie was suprisingly good and entertaining I was expecting a horrible move, instead I got 2 hrs of entertainment. This movie is loaded with star power. The story is basic old school robo cop with a little twist. Don't exspert a Oscar type plot just enjoy for what it is
B006H5120E|5|Love this movie and the 3-D is great and made the movie even better.  Highly recommend
386521584X|5|I heard a bit about this terrific collection of Robert Frank photos on NPR, commemorating the 50th anniversary of its publication in the US. The collection is wonderful, with many shots of a side of 1950s America not usually seen by the public. Robert Frank lugged his camera to black funerals, dirty city streets and urban rooftops to capture the unglamorous -- yet very real -- people who lived there. Some of his images are startling and beautiful. A newsstand's stack of displayed magazines melds into the stacked framework of an office building; a statue of St. Francis, backlit against a murky sky, striding forward to preach repentance to the gas station across the street; an ugly jumble of rooftops is softened by gauzy curtains through which the image was shot.<br /><br />There is plenty of understated social commentary to be seen as well. A city bus dashes by with its load of whites and blacks -- males and whites in the foremost seats, kids in the middle, blacks in the back -- that perfectly mirrors the social pecking order of the day. An overexposed image shows an older black women holding a white baby -- her presence the only splash of color in a world that is otherwise stark and white. And jukeboxes have never seemed so otherworldly than in Frank's images.<br /><br />Nearly all of Frank's seemingly ordinary images carry some sort of a subtle bite or humorous twist. One of my favorite images is of a cowboy lighting a cigarette on a street in New York street -- and in the background is a truck with \\"Dodge\\" (as in Dodge City)  in prominent letters. This sense of twisted fun and irony makes the photos viewable from an artistic level, exciting intellectually, but also fascinating from a social perspective. Frank's point of view is fairly obvious -- he opposes racial bigotry and marginalization of the poor -- but he is never condemnatory toward his subjects or to the story he is telling.<br /><br />\\"The Americans\\" is a terrific collection from a gifted and humane artist. It will make you smile.ile.
B006ZEDZNY|1|I rented the video, which worked very well.  I did not have any problems with the Amazon video streaming.  I also liked how the application's search engine.  It was very easy to use and worked well on my TV.  The moving couldn't decide what it wanted to be a comedy or a drama.  It was neither and, therefore, failed miserably.
B000000H4V|3|I was eager to buy this album because I am a humongous fan of &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; and &quot;Beneath The Remains&quot; as well as &quot;Roots&quot;, so I sorta expected this to be a cross between those two. I was right and wrong. As it turns out, I like the faster and more thrashy songs better, such as &quot;Slave New World&quot; and &quot;BioTech Is Godzilla&quot;.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Addictive game!
B00FAPF5U0|4|love it can't stop playing. everyone should try it.  want more bonuses . my son loves it and he's only seven
B00AB0Z88S|1|This 3D was highly touted.  It consists of a very lame story and some slightly interesting special effects.  I'd give this film a score of -5 on a 10 point scale.
B00CS65QGW|4|When I heard this group play this song. I just had to have it. Thank you Amazon for always providing me with excellent music.
B006FTCGXY|2|Interesting premise that reeled me into the rental, but I felt like a dead fish by the end of the movie.  (I was literally flopping around on the floor, slightly comatose.)  It is thought-provoking, and I was not expecting a &#34;Star Trek: Into Darkness&#34; action-fest.  But every scene felt twice as long as it should have been, and I never bought into the relationship and dialogue between the main characters Rhoda and John.  It did encourage a semi-spirited discussion between me and my wife (after she awakened me from my coma), but in the end we both concluded we were annoyed by the plot loopholes and sluggishness.
B002LFPAUC|5|Great series! It was like seeing them for the first time.
B007SGM084|5|This book was awesome not just the sexual content but the entire story.  The story was well written  and not had to follow. I rated the story 5 star because of the beautiful story that was given not the erotic sex even though it was a part of the story. I admired the fact that they both had to help each other even though he was more broken from his childhood. My friend even read the book again because she miss the beautiful story the first time she read the book. When I started reading and was talking about the story she got excited and read the books again. Awesome
B00FOWX6NM|5|Perfect condition and in its original box. Authentication seal inside. Definitely recommend it!
B008KYOCA2|4|Good calendar, takes a little bit to figure out how to edit or delete tasks but all in all is a good app.
B00FVVR2ZO|4|I like this hidden objects games. I am not sure what my objective is but I don't care. I just enjoy finding things!
B00QQW1ZIW|3|Movie was entertaining and it really had a good story line that I felt was underutilized in what could have been a special effects epic movie. This was a missed opportunity to make this an all time great movie tht=at you want to watch over and over again.
B00992CF6W|5|Pocket edition is great. P.C. is better but P.E. is the best iPad and mobile device version, and ever since 0.10.0 came<br />Out I was surprised because of  the great graphics . But please notch and you Jeb bring back lite and more stuff when you get a update after 0.10.4
B00H1MDH3W|4|Neat program to see the constellation, which may otherwise be hidden to many city dwellers due to smog.
0385340567|1|You suck. Why won't you let me change my order.  I always order books to my ipad--not hard copies.  I don't want a hard copy.  If you force me to take the book, i will pay, however, You are fired.
B00I8Y5E2Y|3|Came at a good time, quickly and i knew the book was &#34;used&#34; but was a little more &#34;used&#34; than i thought, besides that i am very pleased.
B000NA28I4|3|First of all...I LOVE sword and sorcery fantasy!!! So I was really looking forward to this movie. The name put me off a bit because it was just suspiciously close to the name of the hero from LOTR. Should have followed my gut and rented instead of buying because this is a one time viewing event.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, LOTR set the bar so high for this type of movie that the chances of anything even coming close are zero to none. Remember that what gave LOTR its greatness was the source material. Tolkien was a genius and his meticulous development of a whole realm of existence was amazing. LOTR is (and will probably always be) the gold standard for fantasy, sword, and sorcery. Good acting and special effects can NEVER make up for a weak story. This is the problem with much of Star Wars for example...and most modern films (Fantasy/Sci-Fi) in general. And then there is the whole bugaboo about adapting books to film... <br /> <br />That being said. If you go into this movie not expecting something \\"great\\" but just enjoyable, most \\"young\\" fantasy buffs should enjoy this film. The strengths are the visuals. Unfortunately the weakness is just about everything else (plot...yawn, acting...a whimpy \\"hero\\", predictable villains, sassy dragon, etc.). <br /> <br />The female lead is enchanting and I hope to see more of her in the future. The male lead on the other hand was totally miscast. Even in the film he admits \\"yea you probably expected more\\". Even the black leader of the resistance somehow seemed like a token of political correctness. He seemed very out of place.  <br /> <br />All in all a pretty average film with some nice special effects and cinematography. <br /> <br />BTW..I have not read the book but it did feel like the movie was compressed and rushed. I suspect a lot was left out.

0394800389|5|This is my all time FAVORITE Dr Seuss book. My dad read this to my brother and myself growing up and we always got a kick out it. Dr Seuss is one of the writers that grips your attention and sparks your imagination. If you have a little one or you are young at heart this book is for you.
B0051UP5NQ|1|why do they want to have access to my texts and photo messages?  this seems like a serious privacy intrusion.  what is the reason for their desire to be able to read private texts?
0446310786|5|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  There was a lot of racism during this time and it's expressed in this book.  The Finch family includes Jean Louise, aka Scout, Jem, and Atticus.  Atticus is the father of Scout and Jem.  They're mother died when Scout was young, so Scout is quite a tomboy.  During the summer, Dill stays in town and plays with Jem and Scout.  Most of their time is occupied wondering what happens beyond the Radley's door.  The Radley's are neighbors of the Finches and are very mysterious people.  Arthur Radley, aka Boo, is the most mysterious of them all though.  None of the kids have seen him.  But that is one thing Scout, Jem, and Dill intend on changing.  During all this, Atticus is appointed to defend a black man on trial for raping Mayela Ewell.  Most of the town and county look down on Atticus for taking this case.  Jem and Scout even get bothered by this.  But through all of it, the family sticks together. <br />I highly recommend this book.  It tells a point of view that you may not have thought about before.
B005LJJESY|4|When I bought the movie, I thought that I was going to be getting it on a dvd. Now everytime I want to watch it I have to sit at my computer and watch it.
B00CATSONE|5|Really, REALLY interesting.  Sounds like Nikola Tesla was an Asperger's type guy.  According to this book he was really taken advantage of by Thomas Edison who has always been made out to be such a hero.  Eye opening read.  I love biographies and this was an interesting one.
0451232852|5|Great book!!
B00BUCXVPI|5|Awesome action movie and also has quite a few funny scenes throughout. Tom Cruise fits the character well as usual.
B0075MFS9Y|5|Great item!
B005723JSQ|3|This story is cute, funny at times. I read it on a long plane ride.  The main character is a bit annoying towards to end when she does not get it, but that seems to be a revolving theme in Kinsella's novel.
1401308201|5|Wicked, the \\"true\\" story of the witches of OZ!  What a wonderful concept and the play is so marvelous in making the story so believable. The book helps you see the underlying story in the Frank Baum, Wizard of OZ. If you haven't seen the play, the book will intrigue you enough to want to see it, again and again.  If you have seen the play, then this book is a wonderful companion. While it has the usual pictures and glossy prints, it also has the script which is superb. The ending is missing from the script, so the play is a must see!!!
B008Y73940|5|An excellent movie with Mathew McConaughey as a lawyer that works from a limousine.  He takes clients that many would turn down because they may not look innocent.  When he gets the wrong man off he works to see that justice prevails even if it may mean he is disbarred.<br /><br />CA Luster
B0029O08WA|5|Great album! Regardless of how you feel about the movie or the Saga, you cannot the deny the amazing songs that were written just for this movie!
B0002858YS|5|Every song on this album is an amazing tune, and all the songs have excellent words(chandelier of stars and atmosphere, or we were justa good thing we were sucha good thing...), and even more amazing music. An excellent buy and overall hit. I highly recommend to anyone. Good intro to alternative rock for all you newbies.
B00BAXFDLM|1|The first 60% of the book can be dispensed with almost in entirety, and it's an absolute slog to get through. The characters are ill-defined brownish blobs, physically described in absolutely no detail beyond skin color.<br /><br />The protagonist's language is supposedly entirely gender-neutral, yet it uses the feminine for everything, including male characters. It goes beyond pronouns; regardless of sex, they are girls, women, daughters, grandmothers. Infuriating inconsistencies abound just as you adjust to it; for instance, why do people with no gender in their language say things like &#34;yes sir&#34;?<br /><br />The book goes on and on about Radch society and its culture but is nearly devoid of description for anything else: What people, vehicles, places and things look like, etc. The book is full of songs and humming yet comes across as oddly silent beyond rather lazy descriptors like &#34;it was noisy&#34; or &#34;it was quieter than the noisy outside.&#34;<br /><br />The protagonist's motivations are ill-defined most of the time, or simply boil down to &#34;I don't know why I'm doing this, but I am.&#34;<br /><br />The first characters to show any signs of life are about 30% in and this comes from their apparent inability to speak as anything other than right-wing caricatures (&#34;the poor are lazy, we might've jacked up the environment but we gave those lazy poor people JOBS!&#34; etc). Naturally, they are all killed off soon after.<br /><br />I've heard that this book &#34;discusses&#34; gender. I suppose it does, in that the protagonist is complaining constantly that &#34;she&#34; doesn't understand it and constantly embarrasses herself by misgendering people in conversations outside of her own language. It's also said that it discusses colonialism. Not really, no. The Radch Empire is expansionist, or used to be, but had its progress checked by technologically superior aliens. That's about it.<br /><br />The pacing is glacial, the conversations unnatural and stiff, and there's a LOT of talking and internal monologing. Action only really happens in the last third of the book, most of it close to the end.<br /><br />It's just a long, boring, confusing slog without anything to really set it apart from sci-fi aside from how frustrating it is to read.<br /><br />(Crossposted from my Goodreads account)l and stiff, and there's a LOT of talking and internal monologing.

B00003CXE7|5|Well. While I saw it last year, films such as Caesar and Cleopatra, Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Quo Vadis? and Cleopatra rolled in my head. But this was different. A real characterisation of a person who longed for a family reunion in Valhalla. And even better; the action/spectacular scenes never interfered with the story but served its purpose... It is a magical piece of work and a good swansong for Oliver Reed.
B00594XOZU|5|Best if you have friends to share this app with..
B004TACMZ8|5|Very user friendly. I have to say that this is the first useful stud finder I have purchased. So now I'm 1 for 5.
B008Y7N7JW|5|Intense, riveting, great entertainment!  Great special effects and acting laced with touching scenes that balance out the heart pounding script.
B00MFDOY8O|5|It's a slow start but when the action starts it's something amazing.
B00425S1H8|5|I bought this to connect my wife's Pfaff Embroidery Machine to her new ASUS laptop running Win 8.1.  I downloaded the drivers as instructed, installed them, plugged the cable in and connected the embroidery machine.  It all worked flawlessly the first time.  I had purchased a similar cable from Fry's but it wouldn't work.  This one is highly recommended.
B000I2J76I|5|This looked great on HD-DVD. I can't wait until everyone moves to HD-DVD so the prices get even better.
B003XVYLDU|1|I actually enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was enlightning. I couldn't believe how horrific the event was. After I read the book, I researched Dresden and what happened to the city. I couldn't believe that the facts were so different from what was accounted in the novel. In fact, at first I told myself, well maybe he didn't have the true facts before he wrote the book. That wasn't so. The true facts of Dresden were released in the 1950's. The book was published in 1969. So, read it as a fairy tale. Or maybe as a Hollywood \\"inspired from a true story.\\"<br />The casualty reports are highly inaccurate, and the fact that Dresden was indeed used for German military production was innacurately represented in the book. I would encourage anyone that reads this book to also research their facts. After I found the truth I discovered a book that was more anti-american propaganda than anything else.
0486437442|1|I am, at first, very disappointed to have received a book that was, according to Amazon, published in 2004 but which is in fact a facsimile from 1921.  It is possible to read this book only as an historical document.  There are too many examples to cite in a brief review, so I shall restrain myself to one.  Chapter 10 is titled 'Language, Race and Culture.'  Good grief!  Short-headed and long-headed people!  Amazon, please be more honest about the original publication date of books, and by all means inform us of subsequent editions.  This book, with all its outdated stereotypes, will  inhabit a dark corner on my shelves.
B00GO95TAC|5|Delighted to pay $8 to view this gem the same weekend as its premier in the UK! Certainly better than the cost of the theatre especially for two people!<br /><br />And by way of actually reviewing the movie itself, as opposed to Amazon's selling practices, this was a wonderfully executed piece and highly appropriate for commemorating Doctor Who's 50th.  It's a great union of new material and acknowledged history.  I do recommend viewing the mini movie &#34;Night of the Doctor&#34; for a little backstory to John Hurt's Doctor.<br /><br />Finally, don't blink. Not on account of Weeping Angels but because you might miss a brilliantly flippant but subtle quip. About what one would expect from Tennant and Smith.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00AF6MF9I|4|Good game so far. It takes awhile to get money but there is always something to do. So far I can't stop playing. There is a lot to learn and a lot of options which I do like. I definitely recommend this game.
B0081336FO|5|This is a very well done SH, top class performances by the actors and intriguing plots. You will truly begin to hate the protagonist, Moriarty, who plays his role smug and psychotic. My favorite is John Watson who balances an almost too robotic Holmes. All in all, well done!
B00AO2P3GA|5|this game really reminds me of mw3 it is really y awesome n I love playing online worth every penny
1592400876|3|I found this book very well written.  It made much more sense of puncuation than I have previously known.  The writer draws you in and appeals to the sense of humour.  I found impelled to continue reading even though the subject wasn't one I found I had obessed over before.  It was a very easy book to read, other than the more difficult quotes; which the author agrees are misleading.  I have rated this book 3/5 as the subject is not appealing.  I would read any further books by the same author.
B00DGMVJAO|5|I really didn't expect to like this movie very much, so it was a huge surprise that I loved it. The actor that played Jack was so good, and the giants were amazingly real, but also amazingly gross! :o)
B0018BB20W|5|ok
B00M4JUREO|5|I was in the Halloween mood to re-read Frankenstein.  It's better every time.  A masterpiece, and this edition is the real thing.  Don't buy mutations of this classic!
B00EV1YZ96|5|I love it.  It is fun for children 1oo and under.  Gave the movie to three god-children  and an adult niece.  JMB
B00B4VI8MQ|5|. I  Great game. Challenging enough to keep me playing unit not too difficult.  Graphics are great. Hints are readily available. Definitely worth the price.
B00KW23WOC|4|It's a good action movie
B003Y5H5FG|2|That is a play on the tagline of The Original Movie. The Fright Night remake which is better acted than the original better effects & in all instances is better than the original. IF YOU ARE HIGH! I know that's mean & rude but that's how I feel. I'm going to tear this movie a new a  s  s hole. This was just another pointless remake just like The Halloween remake just like The Nightmare On Elm Street remake & so many others. As I have always said we all have our likes & dislikes when I hate on a movie it's not against the fans of that movie it's against the movie. This is a rant so don't leave mean & rude comments or I will reply in kind if I mispell things in this rant well it's a RANT. I don't hate every remake. I like The Thing from 1982. The Blob from 1988, The Fly from 1986. Even remakes made the past few years like Dawn Of The Dead, The Hills Have Eyes & The Friday The 13th remake. Before I rant on this pos let me tell  you 2 ideas that would've made this unique. Todd Farmer had a script that would've had Tom Atkins & Jamie Lee Curtis star in incresingly bad remakes of Fright Night they work The Horror Convintions & Jamie Lee would've been written as a money hungry coward. Jerry Dandridge's assistant Billy would've fought Derek Mears at a Horror Convintion. The structure would've been the same as the original but would've had different situations that were diffent & more violent. Charley would tell Tom Atkins what he saw Tom Atkins would've been amused & just played along cause he had nothing better to do. Another script would've taken place where Fright Night is just a popular movie the main character believe's a Vampire lives next door he wouldn't seek out the help of anyone named Peter Vincent. He would seek out the help of Chris Sarandon who played Jerry Dandridge in the original Fright Night who would know better if there is a Vampire next door. If you wonder why this got rejected everyone in the board room loved the ideas I think they were brillant. HeadExecutive Of Screen Gems Clint Culpepper the same studio who gave us The Prom Night remake which is a CW version & an insault to the original & The Stepfather remake said \\"Duh I don't get it.\\" Yeah but you thought that The Prom Night remake was an awesome idea you dip<br />s  h  i  t. It's The Clint Culpepper's of the world why movie quality is down from the 80's & 90's they should be cleaning out the toilet's at the studio not making the decison's Dreamworks had a hand in this movie at 1 time they wanted to make it family friendly which explains the low body count & cartooney gore. Anyway let's get to this Teeny Bopper version of Fright Night. Made on a budget of $30 million made $18 million in The US. internationally it made $23 million so worlwide it made $41 million but it was a bomb cause do you know how much extra money goes into the marketing & advertising & the gross share of money among theaters. Directed by Craig Gillespie he directed Mr Woodcock & Lars & The Real Girl on top of directing episodes of Untited States Of Tara. He had about as much credibility directing a horror film as George Tillman did directing a action movie. It stars Anton Yelchin as Charley Brewster, Colin Farell as Jerry Dandruff I mean Dandridge I say that cause he has the hair cut that's straight out of Twlight. David Tennant as Peter Vincent, Toni Collette as Jane Brewster she was on that show UST so that's how she got the job. Imgoen Poots as Amy peterson & Christopher Mintz Plasse as \\"Evil Ed\\". Story is Jerry Dandridge kills this family. Then you have a joke orf an opening where Fright Night pops up it just looked so cheap. So you have The CW version of Fright Night that takes place in The Suburbs Of Las Vegas so they can relate to The CW crowd. Your introduced to Charley Brewster & his Mom Jane & Charley's Girlfriend Amy that looks straight out of The CW & their relationship isn't believeable. Charley's Mom looks straight out of The CW. I mean when I was growing up not very manyof the kids I knew had hot Mom's they looked like real Mom's even in the older horror movies most of the Mom's looked like real Mom's they weren't hottie's. Charley is just so unlikeable he turned his back on his friend Evil Ed to be popular & hang out with the cool kids & be a tool. The kid at the beginning that is killed was friends with Evil Ed Charley used to hang out with them. Your introduced to Jerry Dandridge who looks like an older version of the lead dork in The Twlight movies he has the pale skin & the hair cut. You haved Evil Ed tell Charley that his neighbor is a Vampire. I was like wtf it didn't make sense. They take a stab at Twlight which I'm thinking this movie has a villain that looks straight out of Twlight. You also have homage after homage like Jerry eating an apple like in the origina. Evil Ed talks smack about Charley's girlfriend & calls him out on why he's became jerk. Charley shoves Evil Ed & tells him \\"You know when my life started getting better is when I stopped being friends with you.\\"So I'm suppose to root & care about this a  s  s hole. Wouldn't have been bettter if Evil Ed was the lead since he seems to know about Jerry being a Vampire & Charley is unlikeable there is no likeable characters& I will say until the day I die \\"When I don't care about the characters I don't care about the movie.\\" There's a scene where Jerry asks Charley for some beers & Colin Farrell in this scene just kept talking & talking & I was like dude STFU. Charley seeks out the help of Peter Vincent who is a Magican & an expert in the occult & that makes him an expert in Vampires & his parents were killed by Jerry Dandridge & he doesn't help Charley. You have them do another homage to the original where Charley is looking out the window & not paying attention to Amy & he falls asleep & wakes up when he hears screams from next door. Jerry leavs the house so Charley breaks into his house he picks a lock to get in he looks up how to pick a lock on his i phone the director needs to google how to direct. Charley finds these secret rooms he finds this lady from next door. Jerry returns wow that was a quick trip. Jerry bites her . Charley tries to rescue this chick when they get outside the girl dies due to the sunlight. Which that was the quickest turn from human to vampire & she died in a horrific CGI effect. Later on you have Jerry go to their house Charley won't let him in so Jerry digs us a gas line & sets the house on fire they get out of there. Jerry throws a motorcycle into the back of the van. The effect of the motorcycle going into the back of the van is really shoddy CGI. Everytime taht Jerry rams the van with his truck & the glass breaks in the van in a cartoon CGI effect. Jane runs Jerry over & he hides under the van. You know what this reminded me of the episode of The Simpsons where Side Show Bob hid under the car. He starts punching holes under the van they stop the van. Then you have scene that made me mad as fire you have Jerry in his Vampire form which is done in some horrible CGI he kills a motorist played by Chris Sarandon the original Jerry Dandridge. To say were the new Fright Night I seriously wanted to find Craig Gillespie & yell the right act at him cause this movie is an insault to the original.  & The CGI for Jerry's Vampire form is awful. You mean to tell me that practical effects can't be done anymore cause they can I've seen direct to DVD movies on $5 & $10 million budgets do it. Practical effects like the make up effects blood squibs can all still be done. They just don't do it cause there lazy. Jane takes a Century 21st sign & stabs Jerry in the back was that suppose to be funny or suppose to be a moment to make you yell yeah get him. Either way it fell flat. Was Century 21st sponsering this movie btw.  Jane faints I don't know how or why she did. They have Charley act sorry for the way he treated all his old friends which I didn't buy just like I didn't buy Charley & Amy's relationship in this movie.  Perter Vincent calls Charley they go to his place. Then you have Evil Ed come in to try & kill Peter Vincent now the original Peter Vincent was afraid of The Vampires nut his reactions felt real & he had great moments like when he fights Evil Ed in the original or when he kills Evil Ed in the original or when he fires that gun at Billy or helps Charley fight Jerry Dandridge in the original. Even in Fright Night II Peter Vincent has more to do than Peter Vincent in the remake plus you had Roddy McDowall who was great. Charley & Amy kill Evil Ed. Jerry chases after them all the way to a Night Club like in the original Jerry puts Amy under a trance & bites her like in the original. I'd rather watch the original. Cause when they constanly referance & homage a previous movie I'd rather watch the original. Charley goes off buys stuff to kill Vampires when he suits up it's not cool like Alice in NOES 4 it's laughable it's like The Ghostbusters version of a Vampire Killer. I'm going to skip ahead basically Peter Vincent fires a shot gun at Jerry Dandridge & he can't shoot to save his life. Charley puts on a fire suit sets himself on fire & when he puts on the mask Anton Yelchin looks so goofy I just paused & laughed at it. I mean this dude is on fire for over a minute I don't think a fire suit can last that long you'd probably be a crispy critter. Anyway Charley catches Jerry on fire he burns up in a atrocious CGI effect then Charley puts the stake into his chest & he dies in some of the worst CGI i have ever seen. Charley & Amy get it on at Peter Vincent's place & I'm glad this movie was over. The cast was terrible imo. There was nobody to root for. They got picked cause they had pretty faces not on acting ability. I'm tired of this CW look in horror movies. Jerry Dandridge looks like a Twlight dork. The CGI is atrocious. The score is forgettable by Ramin Dsueadi it has nothing on the great scores from Fright Night 1 & II. I'm glad this movie tanked I doubt there's going to be a Fright Night 2 Electric Boogaloo. Craig Gillespie you should be ashamed. Anton Yelchin  I don't blame him for doing bad in this movie I blame the writing. Colin Farrell was horible & he went on to ruin another classic Total Recall which was another reamke that he's done & it tanked. Toni Collette was bad. Imogen Poots replace the T with a P & that sums up what I thought of her perfomance. Dabid Tennant wasn't any good & The Peter Vincent character was pointless in this movie. Christopher Mintz Plasse was ok. Just watch the original & part II this movie just blows.
B00M4ADWQ8|5|One of, if not, the best spins on a classic to date!
B00B7Y0206|5|This app makes viewing youtube easy. The downloading of videos does work and just a tip, if you start to download a video, and watch it as it downloads, it makes it download quicker. Another thing, I wish it would tell you this to start but, you can only have about six videos downloaded. It will not tell you that you have reached the limit but it won't download. All in all, I think its a great app only the summary should add a few minor details.
0380804557|4|This book was a nice fast read, and had some fairly interestesting and unexpected twists to keep you entertained. There were also some really racy parts, though, making it not for kids, though I would think they would love the basic story. I haven't seen the movie yet, and anticipate that it will be interesting to compare.

B00ENIR864|4|Good app.  Had some difficulty scanning, but was eventually successful for all scanning attemps.
0790744295|5|Creepshow pays homage to the old E.C. horror comics that caused so much controversy in the 50's and eventually spawned the watchdog group the Comics Code Authority.<br />George Romero and Stephen King worked together to make this film and their mastery of their craft shows.  King wrote 5 solid stories here (some better than others). Romero wrapped them in a comic book style, fever-dream colors, and frenzied artwork backgrounds.  The effect is, literally, a film comic book.<br />Five stories are presented.  My personal favorite is &quot;The Crate&quot;.  Not only does it have the scariest monster and creepiest concept, but it also has amazing performances by Hal Holbrook and Fritz Weaver.<br />Lots of name stars appear in the film, including Stephen King starring as a country moron in &quot;The Lonesome Death of Jody Verill&quot;.<br />Anyone who has ever gone to a local House of Horrors around halloween and come away disappointed, was probably hoping for an experience like the one that Creepshow delivers.  A nightmarish, colorful, disturbing spookfest that sticks with you, even after you turn off your television.
B00THRQBD2|4|Especially slow ones are great.
B007J4T2G8|5|I'm not a big time reader but heard many reviews about the book. I love the series and can't wait to read more by this author
B004LOMB2Q|5|I love this app for it connects my tablet to my computer. Not only can I take notes on the go, but that note goes with me wherever I go. I love the mobility of it all! Cannot say enough about this app.
B005ZOBNOI|5|My inaugural John Green novel and I'm hooked. Never fallen so hard in love since Eric Segal's Love Story or since Rose & Jack in Titanic the movie. You're left wishing you never read it because you're zoned out for days replaying the book in your head and life's never quite the same ever again.  As surely as art imitates life--I'm compelled to write to John Green to demand a sequel and fill in the blanks. What happens to Hazel? Does she die too? What about Issac? Did Monica return? Did An Imperial Affliction ever get its deserved re-telling to finish the tale?
B000JIJPZY|3|My granddaughter likes this all right. But she's more of a touch it/sound effect person and the ball on the cat is tough to get sound out of with tiny 2 1/2 month hands. She loves the bouncer that the slightest kick or hit will activate the sounds.
B00L87MMU0|5|Loved it.
B006MW3UZW|4|My wife and I really liked Downton Abbey and wonder that people actually lived that way from both the servants and the employers viewpoint. I watched what episodes were available on Netflix because Netflix has closed captioning and Amazon does not. Too bad because I think Amazon has some good content, but I do need the captions to be able to understand all the story. We are now watching Season 3 week to week after recording it on our DVR.
B000002JQ6|4|I have to echo the sentiments of another reviewer.  This is a good disc for those who are NOT huge fans of the band.  14 of the bet ACDC Songs are on this puppy including my three favorites(Whole Lotta Rosie, You Shook Me All Night Long and Highway To Hell) all in a row.  Almost all the songs are heavy and hard and Brian Johnson's vocals are oh so screetchy. So under normal circumstances, this recording would probably get three stars.  However, to distinguish it as on of the better releases by ACDC, I'm nudging it up a notch.

B0026P3G12|5|Susan Boyle's voice is so sweet and lovely to listen to when I'm riding in my car. My favorite songs on the cd are \\"Who I was born to be\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" From the first time I heard her sing, I knew I wanted to buy her record.<br /><br />I'm so glad she finally had her dream come true. Can't wait for a 2nd cd to come out.<br /><br />Mimi from Puerto Rico
B0002OERI0|5|Definitely a good CD with a powerful message about what America has become but I think they could do without the cursing.  There are also a few weak spots. <br /> <br />What I thought was strange that tracks number 2 and 12 include several short songs under one track listing.  At first this is kind of cool but later on it gets somewhat annoying when you have to listen through all eight minutes of track 2 at once to get to your favorite song on it.  Track number 2 includes 'Jesus of Suburbia' 'City of the Damned' 'I don't care' 'Dearly Beloved' and 'Tale of another broken home.' <br /> <br />Track number 12 includes 'The Death of St. Jimmy' 'East 12th Street' 'Nobody likes you' 'We're coming home again' and 'Rock and Roll Girlfriend.' <br /> <br />There were quite a few highlights on this album including \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" \\"Give me Novacaine\\" (which is a completely random song but for some reason, I like it) \\"Wake me up when September Ends\\" and \\"Whatsername.\\"  Most of the other songs are medocre but not very memorable or all that good. <br /> <br />One of my least favorite songs was actually \\"American Idiot.\\"  The lyrics were definitely making a statement but the melody is just an incredibly simple guitar part that gets pretty annoying after awhile. <br /> <br />Overall, I do recommend this CD but be aware of the weaknesses.
B007IXWL2C|3|Good conclusion but not nearly as good as the first book. It's totaly worth reading to find out the end of the saga.
0316789704|5|Ed Emberley is just fantastic. I had only one or two of his books as a child (30-ish years ago) and once I found out there were more, I bought everyone I could find. My girls really enjoy them (now almost teens). The step by step approach to taking shapes they're familiar with and putting them together to make such cute drawings helps them to branch out into drawings of their own. We leave notes for each other and put something we learned to draw from EE's books on the note - brightens everyone's day!
B009GX7IRA|5|I love NCIS!  This is one of the best series on TV.  Mark Hamill is terrific in his role as the leader of a very cohesive, smooth functioning Naval investigative team.
B00006CXXU|4|It's obvious that Christina worked very hard on this album, and for that, she is to be commended. She put herself out there, \\"stripped,\\" as the title claims, and shows how she really feels.<BR>The music is good, solid pop, but nothing extraordinary. (Save, maybe, for \\"Beautiful.\\")

B000JMLKCG|5|A great Thomas Hardy classic. If you liked Far From the Madding Crowd you will not be disappointed in this tale. Also, the cost of this book is very attractive.
B004GUSG4M|3|The story would go through periods of repetitious episodes that really got boring to me as a reader. Then there were times that were hard to stop reading.
B001BANK32|5|I have read this book multiple times since its orginal publication and it has never disapponted me. If you've only seen the film versions of this story, run, do not walk, to your nearest bookstore or to your computer, and get yourself a copy of this book.  There really aren't words that describe how well crafted this psychological thriller/horror novel is.  I know the story and am still terrified when rereading the novel.  King is a master at this kind of horror and this is one of his finest books.  Its a classic and deserves a space in your home library.  Enjoy!  I wish I could read it for a &#34;first time&#34; again!
B00JH49OTS|1|Wow!  Love it or hate it.  I found it to be pointlessly disturbing, and strange.  But, maybe they were going for something really different.  That's what they got, alright.

B00BSZZA3I|1|This wasn't what I expected.  The packaging was opened and looks like it's been around for awhile.  What counts is what's inside.  I wanted to replace an existing HTC cover (same).  The  supposed to be new cover appeared to be used as I saw dirty finger prints inside the cover.  Build quality didn't seem the same as my old cover so being OEM is suspect.
B0083Z614S|4|My wife was amazed that I,an avid 57 year old reader, had never read this book.  I' glad that I finally did.  It shoes the power of positive thinking and how this quality van make a major change in one' s life.  My only complaint is that I thought they ending to be a bit abrupt.  Otherwise great read!
B00005K3NR|4|Carrie is probably the strangest horror film I have seen and that is saying a lot. Sissy Spacek does a very good job as Carrie as does Piper Laurie as Carrie's crazed religious mom. I think there a few funny instances in this movie and a lot of funny lines (probably none of this was supposed to be funny). It takes a long time to climax but when it does you'll see this movie has the most drastic turn of any movie I've ever seen.(I don't want to give anything away). This sin't a scary film though in my opinion. Scarier Stephen King books that are films are The Shining and It. In general this is a solid rental however i wouldn't buy it unless you find it for under about [price]. \\"We'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness!\\"

B0090SI582|4|Wolverine followed in Superman's footsteps last summer. Both characters had a disappointing solo outing a few years ago (X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Superman Returns) followed by a much better, though not great, film this past year. Superman's reboot left him a bit unsure of himself as a moral hero (not his usual Boy Scout self); Wolverine's new film drains out his healing factor (not his usual immortal self).<br /><br />Wolverine's movie starts with his memories of World War II, specifically when he was in a prison camp just outside Nagasaki before the atomic bomb was dropped. He saved one of the Japanese soldiers who eventually became a highly successful businessman. In the modern day, the businessman sends one of his workers with a gift for Wolverine and a request to come say goodbye to his dying friend. The businessman can afford the best of care but he's an old man and doesn't have much longer to live. Unless, of course, he could get healing powers like Wolverine's...<br /><br />The plot moves on from there in fairly predictable but not unenjoyable fashion. Almost every Japanese stereotype is in the film (seppuku, yakuza, bullet trains, martial arts, samurais, family honor, ninjas, etc. etc.--except I didn't see any sushi or Godzilla*). Logan's loss of healing is a little bit inconsistent but is a good way to make him vulnerable. Hugh Jackman gives a good performance as a tortured soul dealing with a tortured body. And fighting like a crazy, one-man army.<br /><br />Like Man of Steel, The Wolverine is a big step in the right direction for the character and a lot better than I was expecting.

1594746788|5|Andrew Knapp and Momo have been a happy part of my day since I started following FindMomo on Instagram and Twitter. I, myself, am a designer and photographer and former border collie person, and so their work is endlessly delightful. But I dare say even if the match weren't quite as serendipitous that you'll love the work too.<br /><br />Momo is a beautiful dog, and Knapp's photography is a happy mix of great choices of location, framing, and dog-hiding. I can't recommend this book enough. And, bonus points for Knapp's understanding that border collies like Momo aren't traditional pets - they need jobs! Momo's job is hiding! #findmomo #foundmomo #lovemomo

B001H9JBW6|1|I am very fond of British drama on TV, and I am a regular watcher of Masterpiece Theater (and its two spin-off features, Masterpiece Mystery and Masterpiece Contemporary).  However, I did not catch The Last Enemy when it appeared on TV in early 2008.  After reading the reviews in Amazon (seven very enthusiastic and one very negative), I bought the set.  I have watched an episode a night for the past five nights.  My opinion: The Last Enemy is not very good.  From the very first episode I found it very difficult to follow.  It moves too fast for me, without sufficient explanation, sufficient clues, to know what is going on even superficially.  At the end of an episode I found myself somewhat puzzled and annoyed.  It is not very clear just who is who and just how they are related to each other in their roles and jobs.  There is a good deal of sliding ID cards through the door locks, submitting to an eye scan to get through gates, etc.  In the course of five episodes this kind of action becomes just too much -- too much running down a corridor, opening a door with an ID card, then running down a set of stairs, opening another door and bursting into a room where another character is sitting at a computer.  Too much quick scene changing from one group to another, and back and forth changing from group to group, cutting the action into little bits and pieces.  I found the last episode - number 5 - the best of the lot, because it explained more clearly, made more sense, went more slowly, with people talking clearly to each other.  But it too was disappointing - with a disappointing ending.    I found the love story very poorly related to the main plot of suspense: complete information control and thereby people control, political intrigue, and terrorism.  It is also very poorly developed and portrayed, the animal ferocity of Michael's widow in the very first episode being somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable.  The ready complicity of Stephen at this point was also unbelievable.  I found the resolution of this love triangle also very unsatisfactory - and ubelievable.     This story was shown on TV over a period of five weeks - five Sundays, starting in February 2008.  I wonder how many people who began it stayed with it until the end.  Watching it on DVD, I had the opportunity to re-run scenes I did not quite catch - to pick up the bits of dialogue I could not understand at the first playing.  Viewers of the actual Sunday night TV Masterpiece Theater did not have that luxury -- they got it the first time or they didn't get it.  How many lasted through all five Sunday nights?    Finally, this DVD set really needs English subtitles.  It does not have them.  At this date (2010) there is no excuse for that.  (Incidentally, the directions on the screen state that you can have subtitles by clicking on your remote control.  I clicked on mine for each disc and got nothing but the off sign.)    More and more I am finding that the Masterpiece Contemporary shows do not quite satisfy.  They do not in my opinion match Masterpiece Theater or Masterpiece Mystery - not by half.  This DVD set of The Last Enemy confirms my opinion.  I now wish I had saved my money and borrowed this set from the public library.
B00004YA66|5|A very entertaining movie. Good script. Different knid of movie. Big Thrills. Buy it!
B006LSZECO|5|Amazing book!
B00DNB9RXO|3|Nice graphics, and the controls are fluent enough, but constantly flipping around the whole world (and my phone) left me feeling dizzy and sick. Avoid if you are even the slightest bit sensitive to this sort of motion sickness. I play FPS games all the time, and only this game made me feel this way.

B007IXWKUK|4|This book was not as funny as the first book, but a couple chapters in I started to laugh out loud. I am glad i bought them on my kindle so I will always have them to read again. This book is . However more descriptive than the 1st. G ing to buy the 3rd one now.
B00IIUATDM|5|This film employed great actors that did a superb job at demonstrating a movie's plot in the most realistic and intriguing fashion.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|A fabulous read.  Did not want to put it down I knew the ending would be surprising. I hope there is a follow up movie with Matthew mccaunhey i hope john Grisham continues to write. I could read his books everyday.  I even reread some past favorites
B0001ENYKS|1|Do not buy this horrible cd. Everytime i see there single on MTV or hear it on the radio i want to shoot myself in the face. How can people swallow this crap.

B003O86FMW|3|It's well written but I will to admit I enjoyed book one a bit more... The conspiracy at the end was a good twist however... Looking forward to book there
B000FC2PKG|5|From the summary, I was worried whether I would like this book. Could I really read an entire book about a sniper?  I'm more into mystery than action, well and anything Jack Reacher-related. But the reviews said that it was a page-turner and I'm glad I gave it a try because I found a new favorite author. This book kept me guessing all the way through, which is a little hard to do.
B0071XO8RA|5|Seriously compelling reading with likeable characters and believable villains. Easy Fun read that builds an intriguing post apocalypse world that begs to be explored deeper.
B00GEEB730|5|A wonderful read! Finished it in a day, granted nothing else got done, but I couldn't put it down. It made me laugh and cry, but good happy tears.  I love Ove! Enjoy
B00821PCJS|4|I really do like the storyline and how it is all executed. I am so glad its free on prime!
1933633867|5|Disclaimer: I'm not in the social sciences, so if you want an erudite review of the concepts of the book, this ain't it. :)<br /><br />Economics has always been a fairly opaque subject for me (odd, considering that I have studied mathematics). However, sometimes when something is tough to understand, what you really need is a completely fresh view on the subject that you can sort of connect with mentally. After reading this book, stuff like money and the economy make a lot more sense to me (even though I still have a lot more to learn, of course).<br /><br />In general, I find that this is one of the main advantages of the book: it's an uncommon, in-depth look at a lot of things in our culture that are just sort of taken for granted, even if they're not completely understood. For example, the different levels of formality of debt; the way that it can be used to manage social relations; the way that various power structures can usurp the concept and turn it into something else - such concepts are examined in-depth, with historical examples, providing different ways of thinking about things that we all do.<br /><br />My only regret is that I can't really look at the book with a critical eye, as I'm not familiar with most of the history that it describes. But it was quite interesting seeing the historical connections that the author makes, for example, between people like Adam Smith, the society in which he lived, and middle-Eastern writers of centuries prior.<br /><br />Some reviewers say that they hang with the book until the last chapter, where the author puts too much of his own opinion into it (for example, suggesting that we try instituting a modern-day jubilee). Honestly, I would actually say that only about the last 10 pages (of a 50-page chapter) really get into the author's opinion - and the jubilee bit is practically a footnote at the end, so miniscule its mention. Most of the last chapter seemed to me to follow more or less directly from what had been developed earlier.<br /><br />My only nitpick is that the book is riddled with typos and such - not so much that it's unreadable, but there's probably at least one error for every 10-15 pages. It doesn't really affect the quality of the scholarship, but it was kind of annoying to see a final product with so much stuff that just needed a simple copy edit.
B00DCRE7M0|5|Just like every Labrie album, this album gets better with every listen.  Production of the album is superb and tone is great.  The keyboards are more prominent on this album and bring a different atmosphere to the songs which make it stand out completely from the others in my mind.  Chorus in the songs are memorable and catchy.  I think this may be his best vocal performance on all his solo work and maybe better than all the albums after the Awake album.  Instruments are tight just like Static Impulse.  Amnesia and I will not Break are my favorites right now.  Been a huge Dream Theater fan since the mid 90's, but have to admit I have been a lot more excited about Static Impulse and Impermanent Resonance than the last few Dream Theater albums.  A must have for fans of heavy melodic metal!
B00BAXFACO|4|I enjoyed this book very much.  It was very entertaining, and the story unfolded in a believable manner. Mickey is a likeable, flawed character who I wanted to throttle at times because of his careless and reckless behaviours.  I was surprised by the time frame of this story because I fully expected it to pick up with Mickey as a new prosecuting attorney......I'm sure there's a story there waiting to come forth. All in all a very good read...but I am a Harry Bosch fan to the core and consider The Lincoln Lawyer lighter fare to rest on while I wait for another Harry Bosch novel that will submerge me in the dark murky waters of Los Angeles homicides.....

B000002P74|5|In just a few months, I've become a fan of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Ever since their first album, I've come to admire one of the most masterful bands of Southern rock. Second Helping helps me admire them even more. Along with Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd, this one showcases why Skynyrd are rock 'n' roll legends.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Sweet Home Alabama - I'll have to admit, I think that this song is a bit overrated. I've heard it way too many times in movies, TV shows, and commercials. It's a good song, but I've grown tired of it a few years ago.<br /><br />I Need You - This is by far my favorite song on Second Helping. It has a very mellow blues style, complete with beautiful-sounding guitar and bass. One of Skynyrd's greatest, yet sadly one of their most underrated.<br /><br />Don't Ask Me No Questions - This one is nice, but the music seems a bit off. The lyrics are great, though.<br /><br />Workin' For MCA - This is a fun song right here. Makes me want to hear it while driving down a very long road.<br /><br />The Ballad of Curtis Loew - My second favorite. It tells a story of a young boy who enjoys watching and listening an old African-American man playing guitar for him all day. When Curtis dies, the boy wishes that the man was well-known for his music. This is sort of like a homage to the blues, and it sounds brilliant from beginning to end.<br /><br />Swamp Music - This one is also fun to listen to. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, but who cares?<br /><br />The Needle and the Spoon - My third favorite. I wonder why this song isn't so well-known? Oh, well.<br /><br />Call Me the Breeze - Not very good. Not to say that it's bad, but it doesn't sound very catchy. The brass instruments didn't help, either.<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />Don't Ask Me No Questions - There are a few differences here and there, but otherwise both songs sound the same.<br /><br />Was I Right or Wrong - A wonderful song that should have been on this album. Yet another favorite of mine.<br /><br />Take Your Time - Why does the bass sound like the theme to Sesame Street? Oh, well. A good song nonetheless.<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Grade: 9.8/10the bass sound like the theme to Sesame Street? Oh, well. A good song nonetheless.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Grade: 9.8/10

B0036S4B6M|5|So many people love the Netflix series based on this story, but every one of them should read this book, too!  It is so well-written and Ms. Kerman paints a complete picture of her prison experience.  And she tells a great story!  This book is a page-turner.
B00514HDNW|5|I have a really hard time giving a book five stars when I don't like the ending, however in this case I feel the writing is definitely worth it.  As a helpless idealist, I prefer happy endings, all is well with the world, everyone good survives, all the bad guys somehow miraculously are killed, jailed, converted or cured ... Oh yeah.  But somehow all the best books are more realistic, maybe because that's what life is!  Oh well, guess when I need a good happy ending, I'll have to pick we a nice romance novel, but for now ... I loved this book ... all of it.  Even though the ending was unexpected, or wanted (LOL), I can certainly imagine a book two with a surprise beginning!  I doubt it after all these years, but you never know.  Maybe Mr Matheson has one hidden somewhere that will be a surprise release someday.  In any case, I loved reading all the places where the movies (3) got their beginnings.  Great read.
B001NEK2GE|4|I'm not going to review the functionality of this device.  Despite everything I write below, I've already decided that the G13 is everything I hoped it would be.  I will use it for years to come and marvel at how it makes my life easier.<br /><br />The reason I felt compelled to write a review is that I'm disappointed in the ergonomics of this device.  For the first few hours of owning it, I even contemplated returning it.  So now I'll summarize everything wrong with the G13, warranting a 1-star deduction from this amazing product:<br /><br />1) I know this isn't a keyboard, per se, but nearly every keyboard has pull-out feet that either raise or lower the slope or angle of the keyboard.  I always leave mine in, because I like a flat typing surface.  The G13 has a uni-body construction that has a weird arch in the middle.  Because the palm rest is sloped up, my wrist is always bent.  I find this \\"feature\\" the most uncomfortable thing about the device and have noticed unneeded pressure on my palm from gaming in this position.<br /><br />2) The thumb buttons are too low (for me)to be comfortably reached.  I manage, but since this is sort of a one-size-fits-all device, I could see that if Logitech made the stick/thumb-button area adjustable forward or back, it could make a world of difference.<br /><br />3) The thumb stick button.  I know I said I wouldn't talk about functionality but the top of the stick is not only uncomfortable to rest your thumb on, but as other reviewers have written, the amount of surgical precision combined with brute force required to press this thing is ridiculous.<br /><br />That's about it.  Take note, Logitech.  Implement my changes and slap a \\"G113\\" on the top and you'll have yourself a winner.
B007ZTLLMK|5|Unlike other people who give lower ratings due to there own experiences and excuses. I however did enjoy this game. The game is really fun and does get.a little more challenging as you progress, but are not impossible. Very funny when you get so far and then end up crashing.
B00EEN66SY|1|I couldn't get through 15 minutes. Not interesting.
B00KFUU3GQ|1|Anna Paquin is usually great to watch, but unfortunately plays a shallow, juvenile character brought even lower by a bad script and poor special effects. The vampire scenario is the most believable aspect of the whole show, if that gives you an idea of how implausible the rest of plot and characters are.
B00L9B7IKE|5|The entire book is like a train ride but you don't know where you're going.

B000O174CM|5|2006's \\"Dreamgirls\\" shares much in common with 1985's \\"The Color Purple\\": a film with a mostly-black cast helmed by a white director (the latter guided by Bill Condon and the former by Steven Spielberg), a story adapted from another medium (\\"Purple\\" from Alice Walker's bestseller and \\"Dreamgirls\\" from the Broadway hit), a running time of over two hours (\\"The Color Purple\\" at 154 minutes while \\"Dreamgirls\\" runs at only 131), and multiple Oscar nominations but with few or no wins (eleven for \\"Purple\\" with no wins, eight for \\"Dreamgirls\\" with only two wins).<br /><br />It is the latter reason that is the greatest injustice.  Though he was nominated for best supporting actor, Eddie Murphy lost to Alan Arkin in the category and that loss was one of Oscar's greatest blunders.  Murphy is spectacular as the over-the-top-soul-man James \\"Thunder\\" Early in what could truly be described as that proverbial \\"role of a lifetime.\\"  It's as though he was destined to play that part and he should have received an Oscar for his efforts.<br /><br />However, his is not the only ouststanding acting job in the film.  Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, Beyonce Knowles, Anika Noni Rose, Keith Robinson, and, in a lesser yet pivotal role, Danny Glover, all deliver brilliant performances and, for that, the film presents one of the best ensembles of the year.<br /><br />This multi-disc compilation is a packaging wonder.  Sporting a version filled with an extended cut, featuring twelve not-in-the-theatrical-version songs, a plethora of bonus and entertaining features/featurettes, this, like the movie, is entertainment of the highest value.<br /><br />'Tis a shame that Oscar voters didn't quite see it that way.

0446560065|5|I bought the book after watching two videos on [...] of Simon's Cat ([...]). It was a very good decision.  I sat down to read some of it the day the book arrived before leaving for an appointment.  I could not just read some.  I could not help but laugh out loud.  If you are a cat owner you can relate.  It is amazing how much is conveyed without a single word. The is not contrived.  You can relate to the characters, Simon and his cat.  I do not remember when I read a book that I could not help but laugh out loud.

B001AVCFK6|5|I bought this Blu-ray knowing full well I'd enjoy it because I'm a pretty big dork. I didn't see it in theaters, and I've seen no more than 3 episodes of the original series (or any other generation), yet I blindly went ahead and bought it. Once again, I proved that I know myself all too well.    I loved this movie. I could go on about what makes this film so entertaining, but I'm sure it's already been said much more eloquently than I ever could. Basically, it's highly entertaining and fully accessible for people who aren't even fans of Science Fiction, never mind Star Trek. At its core, it's a fun, exhilarating film that's sure to bring in a whole mess of new fans. Including me.    Now, about the Blu-ray. Ever since watching all 9 or so hours of bonus footage provided with the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition DVDs, I've become very spoiled and hard to please with it comes to Behind the Scenes content. The bonus footage on this Blu-ray is easily the best I've seen since. Pretty much everything you'd ever want is included here, with over 3 hours of footage. This means ACTUAL FOOTAGE; none of that slide-show-put-to-music BS. And it's all in high definition! Quite honestly, it's the perfect package. One of the best movie buys I've ever made.

0064471837|5|This is one of my favorite books and I go back to it year after year. Sabriel isn't a stereotypical teenage heroine, and it's a refreshing read when compared to most new books on the market today. The characters have their own unique motivations and goals, and even Kerrigor, the antagonist, is mysterious and very well-written. Mogget is by far my favorite character; the cat is hilarious as often as he is somber and is the perfect side-kick to Sabriel and later Touchstone.<br /><br />The magic in this series is different yet logical, and unlike anything I've read before. The Charter Mages and necromancers, along with the role of the Abhorsen leave this book unable to be pidgeon-holed into any of the popular sub-genres of fantasy. The dichotomy and relationship between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom keeps things interesting when they're close to the wall, from the healthy fear and respect the soldiers around the wall have to the utter disdain for it that is shown by the rest of the military.<br /><br />If you're reading these reviews wondering if you should read it -- you absolutely should. It won't leave you disappointed, and you'll be hungry for the next books right after!
B001GCUO52|1|I oredered this BluRay when it was advertised as The Final Destination in 3D but when it arrived it was only a @D version and Amazon said there was nothing they could do about recieving the wrong product as the copies they now have are only 2D. After my complaint Amazon changed the Advertised BluRay with the note underneath that early copies were in 3D but now they only stock 2D. Well Amazon you should advertise what your selling not advertise a 3D version and send a 2D version. After many years of using Amazon that is a poor excuse why they sent the wrong version. Stop False advertising Amazon.
B009UX2YAC|4|My young great grandson loves this game. I tried to download it on my laptop but it came with so many other games and extraneous garbage. This app is plain and simple.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is amazing and you get to take care of a horse. IT'S SO FUN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I wish this game was real life, that would be even funnier.
B0060ZJ7BC|2|If this is an Oscar-nominated film, Hollywood is in deep trouble. It simply wasn't that good.<br /><br />Did we really have to see Beane's interactions with his daughter and twice suffer through her singing a Lenka song, a tune which is even irritating when sung by Lenka? His relationship with the child did NOTHING to advance the story.<br /><br />The screenplay was dismal. There was absolutely no suspense and there should have been plenty. There was little explanation of Pitt's wheeling and dealing on the phone with club owners. Even the winning of 20 games in a row was not depicted in a thrilling way. It was not.<br /><br />I'm not going to write anything more except to say that Beane, a high school graduate and failed major leaguer, had to have a screw loose to turn down $12.5 million to be the GM of the Red Sox, a team that went on to win the World Series.
B001IFZL50|5|My husband and I really enjoyed the 7 part series. It was really hilarious, and captivating. It truly showed that Marines are just day to day people, with very interesting jobs. My husband is an active duty Gunnery Sergeant in the Marines. He thought it was great the movie implemented many of the acronyms & terms the Marines use. He had to explain a few of them to me. We've recommended the series to many of our friends, especially our friends who don't know anything about the military. It was nice having seen it on Blu-ray, there are a lot of great scenes, and the special features are awesome.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Love it! A wonderful movie for boys, girls, AND mom, and dad! We have watched 3 times in 2 days. It's a funny movie with a little sadness, but not too sad. Sometimes Disney movies are very sad. Like the movie Up. This movie is great. Disney did a great job on this one!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It's really fun and addictive
B00B7Y0206|5|Have you ever wondered &quot;I wish I could watch ________ in the car.&quot; Well, now you can! For $2 you can download youtube videos, and there Is only 1 bad thing. Sometimes, there is a glitch where the audio plays but the vid doesn't. But that's the only flaw.
B002MQYOFW|5|Bought the ebook for my daughters kindle. Easy to download and install.  Can't review actual book since it wasn't for me. 5 stars for ease of purchase, download and installation.
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is awesome. If your a horse lover you will LOVE this game. I hope they make a second one
B00GYQYL7W|5|Very good acting in a thought-provoking story line. I could sense the emotions portrayed by each character as if I were the character.  The only con was that it was a bit slow.
B001EN71CW|5|Great tv show.
B008B8DY2O|5|Shantaram is an incredible book with so many life truths. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book & it comes highly recommended. My father read it three times & has been totally inspired to visit India. After having heard from various people that it is one of those must read books I finally read it over the December 2012 holiday. The writing is poetic filled with philosophical truths. But never boring. It paints a marvelous picture of India from a Western perspective. What I loved about it is that even though it is from a Western perspective it is one that is fully inclusive & embedded in the Indian culture. An absolute winner!
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love this game. Been playing it for a while. You really don't need to spend any kind of money to advance in this game
B00005JKCF|5|Just went to see this movie and it is marvelous. Kudos to Sam Raimi for staying faithful to the source material.<BR>Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker, and Willem Dafoe was terrific as the Green Goblin. Don't take the movie so seriously and just go and enjoy it, and when the movie is over, think to yourself... Wow! I wonder who he'll fight next, Doctor Octopus, how about the Lizard or maybe the Kingpin or...
0345803485|5|This is jaw dropping and I loved every moment. Why was I crying at the end of this book as if it were me leaving??? What I don't know what it is about Christian Grey but I'm so in love with that Grey eyed monster, lover, dominant, sadist!!! Great read...Loved looking up the words...You'll love it, trust me and get out of trying to find all the faults and incorrect grammer and get into the story!!
0307272702|4|Like the book. Easy to understand and the method's are effective.
B002BSHWUU|4|Ok i just got this box set today after a month and a half of waiting.........Its awesome!!!!!!!!!!! its a finely done box set with a nice box and very good remasters that i have found for the most part are better than the originals (with the exceptions of strawberry fields *i like the more distorted sound of the original*,let it be *the song not the album the album itself is sounding way better,and with a little help from my friends *i like the clunked up version better*).So i am very pleased considering i only owned a few albums before hand and my mom feels about the beatles the way i do (read the title) and she was happy to get em (the extras that is)....... So Mr.McCartney You got me but not twice like most of these people. Lastly i would of given this box set 3 stars but i gave it the extra star not for the music but for the nicely done box set!!!!!!!!!!! (probably the nicest one i own)    Excuse My Poor Grammer  Robert Keith
B003F3PMYI|5|This book is easy to read, which leads to the danger that you may go through it too quickly to absorb and implement the material in your own life.  I read through it once, and then went back through to build an implementation plan.  Definitely worth the effort.
B009KUANWG|5|This \\"Bond\\" theme by Adele is one of the best in many years and harks back to some of the classics of the genre!!
B0094K1YHK|5|I'm not the type that will pick a film apart, I follow one test: did I enjoy it or not.  Sky Captain was a cool movie.  Push aside any preconceptions, get a friend, popcorn and some suds and just enjoy!
B0014I4KIK|5|I bought Rockferry by Duffy as a gift for my sister who'd seen her perform on Ellen.  She loves the CD so much that I haven't seen it back in the house since she opened the package!
B00SH00N3Y|1|Great idea for a  movie but written and directed terribly.
B0084IG8TM|5|Excellent. Highly recommended.
B00PSID6ZK|5|My little 5yo niece just loves this game.
B000ZLFALI|5|Simply outstanding; this could be one of my favorite musicals ever. And I love musicals! I was never a big fan of the Beatles; but this movie's versions of the songs are truly beautiful and heartfelt. They made me go back and listen to the Beatles' songs, which gained new depth. Visuals are great and the cast is marvelous. I hope Jim Sturgess has a great future ahead of him.<br /><br />P.S. I like the fact that Sony put subtitles in various languages, including Portuguese, on the DVD/Blu-Ray. It was definitely a nice addition.
B00EGMQIJ0|3|This book went a little too far for me.  It seems highly unlikely that things could progress in the way told here.  Nevertheless,  I am certainly more aware of privacy issues then I was before reading this.  So perhaps this wild exaggeration is worth the read
B00846REIS|5|When I think of the kind of love that I want I imagine the same irresistible magnetic love these characters love. Sylvia Day does a wonderful job capturing a raw lustful romance with just the right amount  if tenderness
B00H58VGIA|5|Wonderful book.  Kept my interest. I am from the South, never knew all this went on.  Such courage these women had.

B000002IZM|5|Vangelis has always been ahead of his time as a musical pioneering genius.This work still holds up astonishingly well from 1982 and will continue to stand the test of time. There is a multitude of other late 70's and 80's sci-fi film soundtracks and scores from other artists that sound very dated and contrived.Those scores will never reach the same cult and classic status or pinnacle as Blade Runner (like the film itself)!     While every critic has used terms like ethereal, mesmerizing, other-worldly, dream-like, etc., etc., one thing remains; This is the ultimate soundtrack for any future sci-fi film out there (some would claim maybe John Williams' Star Wars soundtrack is the king---but remember, we're talking electronic wizardry here, not symphonic or classical).     The bonus tracks not in the film are very intriguing and captivating in their own right and blend in so well with the on-film tracks. The strongest non-soundtrack tracks are the seductively hypnotic  Wait For Me and the melodically enchanting Rachel's Song. One can feel the tension or the build up in Blush Response with it's electronically thundering and repetitve clashing cymbals and slapping percussion(for those that remember the scene in the film this is where Detective Deckard is testing Rachel Tyrell to indulge creator Eldon Tyrell's purpose or point). Blade Runner Blues,Memories of Green and the Love Theme are the soothing jazz-like(\\"electronically warm\\"), melancholy counterpoints to some of the other tracks which paint a very dark and bleak and sometimes chaotic and menacing future world in 2019 drenched and flooded in cold night rain and hot neon-ad lights.Some of the dialogue used from the film on certain tracks adds an enhanced dream-like quality.Listen to the softly spoken words by the replicant Rachel (actress Sean Young)at the beginning of the track Wait For Me;They have a very soothing and calming or tranquil effect (sort of drowsy effect?). For me it's very reminiscent of when I dreamand hear people speaking in my dreams !  Listen to Deckard's dialogue on the first opening titles track; the words sound very hypnotic.He sounds like a hypnotist giving someone commands while they are under a trance(for those of us who have seen the film,we know Deckard is actually giving voice commands to a computer-photo/video enhancer called an Esper machine).Replicant Roy Batty's lines on the last track as he is \\"dying\\", Tears in Rain, as in the movie, concludes the whole soundtrack in a gentle and peaceful manner.In sum, Vangelis chose wisely which dialogue to use and for an excellent artistic effect...    Essentially, what you get from Vangelis is a richly and texturally painted musical sci-fi panorama that beneath it's cold synthesized surface (as described by some)emanates a sound of escapism that to this day is not duplicated by any other artist. It can't be. Hopefully, sometime in the near future, Vangelis will release/re-issue a definitive or complete Blade Runner soundtrack that WILL include the opening credits theme as well as some other vital pieces missing from this cd version (and no more bootlegs, but the real deal)! Even alternate tracks would be greatly welcomed. I can even wait until the year 2007 for a 25th Anniverary edition of both re-mastered dvd and soundtrack version of Blade Runner !
B00005JKDR|4|I thought the movie was great overall and i am 15 years old. My friend saw it with his little sister and told me it was good so i watched my brothers copy.  James &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Waczoski(Billy Cristal)were hilarious as monsters.  My friends and I found the two teenage interns as histarical. The other &quot;baby&quot; monsters were funny especially the one who continually yelled &quot;Mike Waczoski!&quot;. The character &quot;Boo&quot; touched me...i dont know why.  But the strangest thing about it was after i saw the movie and the happy ending (viewers know what im talking about)i was still sad. Perhaps it was how Boo was taken away from before, i dunno.  Anyway buy the movie its great! The special features are cool too!
B00IIUATDM|1|I was extremely disappointed in this movie.  The acting was fine but the nudity and profnity were unnecessary.
B008673ZAQ|5|I LOVE THIS SERIES!  Love the way Gideon is written, great story, have already reread it twice! would recommend to anyone looking a good time!
0545265355|1|Let me start by saying that this series is well written and a fast read.  Beyond that, I am utterly shocked that the content has been written for children.  My 7th grade daughter came home months ago, completely obsessed about this series and I looked at many of the reviews on Amazon.  I was not impressed and refused to purchase the books.  She promptly went to the school library and read them anyway.  Then, my 5th grade son came home with a \\"challenge\\" from his teacher to read a certain number of points by the end of the school year.  A list of books were given with points alotted for each; this series ranked with the highest points of anything save Harry Potter.  I was upset at first but then, after reading the author's own interview on the Hunger Games website about the age group this series is meant for, I was furious.  Neither of my children qualify for the age requirement Mrs. Collins recommended yet, this series is being pushed, recommended, praised and given to everyone with no regard for the scars it will leave.  Then the trailers came out.  With my daughter's obsession growing ever larger, I decided I needed to read the books for myself and know fully what I was up against.  I have just spent the last three days reading the entire trilogy and I can honestly say I have never been more disturbed about anything she has read than I am about this series.  Yes, I could go on and on about the horrible things that happen in the books; murdering children, governmental control, starvation, genocide, etc.  There are more than enough reviews giving a great view of what's in store for the reader.  The most disturbing thing to me is that children are finding something familiar in the the main character, Katniss, and want to pretend to be like her.  In my opinion, there is nothing redeeming about this character.  I understand that the society she lives in has drained her of all emotion but the author clearly wants you to believe there is still a sense of right and wrongin her.  If you buy that, then Katniss is the most selfish, unfeeling, callous person I can imagine.  She kills with no remorse, no thought to what she is doing other than how it will help her survive.  These are not qualities I want my children to relish having, much less find familiarity in.  I am disturbed this is a popular series with the young reader population and I am even more disturbed that it is being made into movies; movies that my children will not see but would like to.  What is our world coming to when we are so numb to death and murder that we let our babies see this kind of filth in living color?  My daughter actually thinks the trailers look \\"cool\\"!  There is nothing cool about killing each other for sport.  Make your own decision about reading this book but let me leave you with this:  I recently read an article about a woman in Asia who was mauled by a bear and did not die immediately.  She was able to use her cell phone and call her mother on three separate occasions during the attack and state that the bear was leaving and returning to feed on her.  Imagine how that must have felt to know something is eating you and you can feel it but not do anything about it.  There is an eerily similar scene at the end of the first book.  Imagine your child reading that and getting a visual in their mind.  Those are images you can't unread.  Now, imagine your child seeing that on a big screen in a theater.  Imagine the blood spatter, the moaning of the victim, the hopelessness of the situation, the endless torture of it all as it continues for hours.  This is not meant for children.
B007ZD17XO|5|This is one of the more entertaining gems games I've ever played!
B00N1HONIO|5|My 10-year-old son likes the intense suspense with the various cameras. He loves this game, but pretty boring for gamer adults.

B004SBS8LA|5|I downloaded and installed it on my Droid X without a hiccup. My phone is rooted, so that may be why I haven't had the problems others have had. It works perfectly and a fun version to the reg. game.
B009OYSFDM|5|When this show first came out, I was expecting a flop. After all, what does the CW have other than old sitcoms in syndication and shows that have been rejected by ABC Family? I had no intention of watching a show centered around a DC Universe B-lister. But then I heard good things about Arrow, heard that it was a superhero show done right. Sounded good, so I watched the pilot on a whim...<br /><br />Ten hours later, I've finished the series to date, and I'm Googling when the next episode will air. At first, I thought this was going to be some bad superhero show. Then I heard it was supposed to be a good superhero show. But both were wrong. Arrow is just a good show, in general. The writing is so solid that I find myself 100% enthralled in each and every character and side plot.<br /><br />Yes, Oliver Queen is on a mostly one-man mission to right his father's wrongs and rid Starling City of an evil criminal shadow organization. But you know what else is happening? Oliver's sister is developing a drug problem. His step father is suspicious that his mother is embezzling money from the family business. Oliver's best friend is trying to shed his playboy persona and settle down with the one girl he ever really loved: Oliver's ex-girlfriend. I care about every single goddamn one of those plots, and the show explores them wonderfully. I can't wait to see how the rest of the season unfolds.
159514188X|5|Excellent story..an easy read.  Great for teenagers to read.  Our words matter.
B00BAXFECK|1|Why did a female author use a man as a main character??  Why did she need over 750 pages to drag out a story that could have been told in 250?!
B00074DXJE|5|Compared to the list price (50$ as of 5/25/2012) spending 7$ (including S & H) is a insane deal for this VHS Tape.<br /><br />Regarding the film itself, it's phenomenal, such a simple plot, but when in the hands of James Wan (Writer & Director) & Leigh Whannell ('Adam' & Writer). It's transformed into this thriller that will keep your eyes fixed to the screen, just waiting to discover what happens next.<br /><br />I doubt many who've seen the film knew what was coming at the very end. And if you've yet to see it (and haven't read/heard spoilers) I doubt you will either.<br /><br />If you can stomach the gore, and are fan of horror/thrillers. You will want to add 'Saw' to the list of films to watch before you die.<br /><br />-Understand that such statements above are opinionated and if you disagree then so be it.-
B008K7WCJM|4|I heard of Swans a little recently, and I really dug their stuff, especially Filth. But This new album is just..theres no words to describe it. Give it a listen and get ready for a demented and strange ride.
B00F8GYC1Y|5|What else needs to be said?  The characters and levels are very entertaining.  I suspect each level was designed to be able to get three stars with one bird or pig but the trick is figuring out exactly where to shoot him/her and timing the use of each character's special weapon.
B001AKF3H4|5|I first bought this music when it first came out on cassette. Now I love that I fan have it on my kindle fire!  Rip. Whitney, you will be missed.

B008XG1X18|5|So many friends that share ideas and recipes.  I love crafts and needlework so this really fits the bill. Very nice go to place.
B004H4XDBI|5|It's not the most riveting story ever, but I almost died last year, so this was amazing getting a perspective of what my friends and family went through while I was in a coma. Good read.
B0036T31YY|1|I stuck it out for the entire movie hoping something in how it ended would make it worth watching the same scene play over and over again too many times.  This was one of the most boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen.  The last part is slightly more informative than the earlier repeats, so if you decide to watch this movie, save yourself and fast forward when the same events start happening a 2nd time, and go to about 10 or 15 minutes from the end and watch from there.  You will miss nothing important and maybe you can make sense of it -- I couldn't.
B0041KKYBA|5|This documentary explains the financial collapse so obviously that you'll want everyone to see it.  So many times people blame the other political party for our economic disaster, but this movie should prove that there's blame for everyone in American politics and especially the top financial companies.  Highly recommend this movie.  It will motivate you to action.
B00CMQX84A|5|grandson loves it
B00009V7T2|5|good lord...this is great music-period.  every song evolves nicely and each listen builds upon the last.  at the drive in? no.  much much better.  Sparta who? who cares, we have the mars volta.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Amazing series!!
0385504209|2|just written for slower folks, with all interesting mind fodder removed. I disagree with some of the other reviews stating this is a total ripoff.... even within the text Brown acknowledges that all of these ideas are old hat and have been for at least decades. As my title indicates, however, Umberto Eco was able to weave the old legends of the Templars into a much more relevant and poignant work. Besides, with Bush's current fantasia of rationales for provoking illegal wars, the nature of truth as elucidated in Foucault's Pendulum is much more pertinent.
B000000993|5|Even if you are not a fan of the band, you are not a rock fan unless you have this albulm in your collection.  This is one heck of a c.d. with songs you can't skip.  Even though I am a big fan of Tool please follow my review and take my word on this is a really good c.d.  If you still aren't sure listen to Tool's other c.d. Anemia which is just as good as this c.d. maybe better but still take a look at this c.d.
B00H3NMXYS|5|Addictive
B00138EXE2|5|I first owned this album on vinyl!  The entire second side was The Gold Bug through Turn of a Friendly Card 2.  It is more than just music tracks.  The album's second side tells a story.  And having been to Las Vegas I can tell you that they hit the nail squarely on the head.  I think The Alan Parsons Project is a great group and, for me, this is the best album they ever recorded (\\"Eve\\" is a close second).
B00006ZXSK|5|EXCELLENT!!!
B00267N3DQ|5|Disney has undoubtedly produced some of the most successful and memorable classic animated films of all time. Ever since it's first feature, the immortalized Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, made its debut in 1937 the company became unstoppable releasing classic after classic.<br /><br />But it all started with Snow White. Beautifully animated, well composed songs, an innocent heroine and a terrifying villainess. This movie first made kids, and adults, fall in love with Disney's animation and the film itself, both wanting to see the movie again and again. To say that over the past 75+ years the film has just survived would be a serious understatement. Through all this time there is still an audience for it, whether it's children of the 2000's seeing it for the first time, their parents who grew up with the film on VHS or even their grandparents who saw the films first run in theaters.<br /><br />There's just something about the feel of the film that makes you at home, which is exactly the way the late great Mr. Walt Disney would want us to feel watching the film. Having said all this the new wave (since the mid 90's) of Disney Pixar films are great, but sometimes people just forget how good traditional Disney animation is.
B00005JOQ9|1|Only by scratching my head and squinting my eyes can I remember sitting through \\"Cabin Fever,\\" which marked writer/director Eli Roth's film debut, and just barely can I remember the movie itself. I remember being entertained by it, but it just wasn't good enough. I decided to give Eli Roth a second chance if he ever made another film, and now he has, if you want to conisder \\"Hostel\\" a film. I'd like to think of it is a heartless, brutal melting pot of the different methods of grisly torture one could inflict on another human being. I am ashamed that I ever saw it.    Exactly what Quentin Tarantino, one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, saw in Eli Roth during his first runaround, much less his sophomore effort, is a mystery. But that's not the biggest mystery. Roth has quickly dropped from an exceptional filmmaker to Uwe Boll lousiness in only one film. God knows what his third film will be like. If it is anything resembling \\"Hostel\\" then you should save your ticket money and purchase it some time later when you stumble accross it in the five-dollar bin at Wal-Mart.     Roth apparently fancies himself a horror film director. Well, I've got news for him. Scenes depicting bound victims having holes drilled in their flesh, their appendages torn off with chainsaws, and their eyes plucked out are not scary, but are instead the disturbing masterworks of a director who could use a little psychiatric care and a happy pill or two. And anyone who finds them entertaining should join the director in a group therapy session. I'm sure they are the same individuals who were mesmerized by last year's similar motion pictures (\\"The Devil's Rejects\\" and \\"Wolf Creek\\").    I paused after finishing the previous paragraph and thought for a moment. Why are films whose central themes include torture, rape, and sadism being made? And who could possibly find them entertaining? I suppose knuckleheaded filmmakers are just all too eager to cash in on garbage to make other garbage films. Turning disgusting content into a profit is a greater crime than what happened with Enron. Films that are gratuitous in senseless violence, vulgar brutality, and nihilism should stay in the sick minds of the people who write them.     Let's just say I'm glad that Roth has chosen to direct these kinds of films, because the material skills in his head will never be able to muster Oscar material. Without waisting much more time discussing the film, I will say that it is almost unbearably violent, disturbing, dark, ugly, mean, and terrible. In his review of last year's \\"Chaos,\\" unseen by me, film critic Roger Ebert wrote \\"Why do we need this s**t?\\" quoting another film critic by the name of Ed Gonzalez. One can ask the same question about \\"Hostel,\\" and I can go even further and label it as a middle finger to the face of cinema. - Isaac    Rated R; 96 minutes; Directed by Eli Roth
B00A6CCF0K|5|Such a fantastic story.  Character development was spot on and I was able to reconnect with a beloved character from the Shining.  In fact, I reconnected with quite a few.  The Shining was one of the first King books I read as a tween and to have a sequel of sorts is just the bees knees.  There were some areas where the story lacked a bit of firmness, a few thin spots so to speak.  But an all-around good book that speaks of compassion, moving on, and just trying not to be a d@uche to people around you.  Bravo, Mr. King!!
B00AO2P3GA|5|Great game it's just like call of duty
B00068IOWM|2|Aside from 'Vertigo', this CD is pretty bad.  The songs have no good hooks, and the themes are not much better.
B005LAJ22Q|5|Movie got here quick and it's so much better than the first season. Would recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the first one. Can't wait for season 3.
B00275EHJG|5|The moving tale of the toys we love being abandoned by their owner and then realizing they were wrong and trying to escape from a Stalag 17 style prison.  Themes of abandonment, growing up and moving on are rampant.  The secondary characters are particularly good and the voices remain the same (mostly) which I appreciate.  No, I didn't cry at the end, you wusses, and, even if I did, you have no evidence!  Heh.  MY GRADE: A minus.
B00A81MV3U|5|This was such a refreshing movie. Bradley Cooper can seriously act!!! I was blown away. Bonus: husbands will enjoy this enough to watch with you....sports references and humorous characters will keep them entertained.
B000031X7T|5|unbelievable. if u like floyd's wall or dark side of the moon you have to have this trust me. the original cd was amazing but this just adds to the excitement. the extra tracks are a must have and different versions of some  songs were spectacular. so just sit down and listen. THE SHOW MUST GO ON!

B007BFSYMS|4|I paid for this... why must I be pestered to rate it. Selections much better and np annoying pestering. Yes, you are pretty... now leave me be.
B009H5IS1W|5|Amazing, This is a great season, We Love Criminal Minds it is the best, Why must I write two more words?
B00VFTCGES|3|From what I've seen and read about the rendering of as near factual imagery of the celestial depictions in the movie, they are absolutely mind boggling. The story line could have been written better. It seems to drag for an inordinate amount of time. Too long..........
0440241901|4|I wasn't expecting much from this novel, I just read it because it was there and I didn't have anything else going at the time.  But it  was such a fun book, I'm going to check out some more of Sophie Kinsella's novels.  The characters were real, with funny circumstances that actually made me laugh out loud. It was very Bridget Jones Diary-ish, or how I imagine it to be as I haven't read it.
B00005V0X5|5|This is a fabulous album from the one and only Megadeth! Megadeth has always had unbelievably talented musicians, and that talent is definitely brought to the forefront on Killing Is My Business. In my opinion Megadeth's phenomenal guitar skills shouldn't even be questioned, and on this album, Dave Mustaine and fellow shredder Chris Poland play plenty of jaw-dropping solos. The talent isn't just limited to the guitar playing, as jazz fusion drummer Gar Samuelson lays down some very impressive beats while bassist David Ellefson gives the songs fantastic bottom end with some awesome bass lines.<br /><br />1. Last Rites/Loved To Death: Very fast tune with some violent, devastating guitar riffs and a furious Dave Mustaine guitar solo. 10/10<br /><br />2. Killing Is My Business...And Business Is Good!: This tune is short, but man is it EVER awesome! The technical guitar riffs on display here are unbelievably amazing, showcasing Mustaine's incredible prowess. Mustaine isn't the only one demonstrating guitar heroics here, as Chris Poland rips his guitar to shreds towards the end of the song. Definitely not to be missed! 10/10<br /><br />3. The Skull Beneath The Skin: 10/10<br /><br />4. Rattlehead: 10/10<br /><br />5. Chosen Ones:  10/10<br /><br />6. Looking Down The Cross: 10/10<br /><br />7. Mechanix: 10/10<br /><br />8. These Boots: 10/10er great slayer-like solo at the end. A Thrash Classic! 10/10 <br /> <br />4.RattleHead: This is another one of my personal favorites because of some more great guitar work done by Chris Poland. Chris Poland is arguably the greatest guitarist Megadeth has ever had besides Marty Friedman. His solos have a great sound to them that you don't find from other guitarists. This song kicks off into high gear with some guitars coming in and then Dave starts singing. This song is about Megadeth's mascot, \\"The VIC Rattlehead.\\" After the first wave of vocals, Chris Poland does a short bluesy type guitar solo wich I love. Some more vocals come in and then Poland does another great solo. After Dave says \\"Rattlehead,\\" Poland does another fantastic solo. Another verse of vocals come in and then Poland does yet another great guitar solo. After the last sentences of vocals, Mustaine does a great solo, his only one in the song. The last vocals including \\"Rattle your god damn head!\\" finish the song. Another thrash classic! 10/10 <br /> <br />5. Chosen Ones: This is another heavy song. It's about Monty Python and The Holy Grail. The song starts off with some guitars and then the vocals come in quickly. After six verses of vocals, Mustaine does a short but great guitar solo. Ater Dave says \\"Lookout,\\" he does a longer guitar solo. It's another great one. After one wave of vocals, Dave Ellefson does his only bass solo in the entire album, but it's a good one. After two more waves of vocals, a great drumming solo ends the song. Another fantastic and heavy song! 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Looking Down The Cross: This song is about when Jesus Christ was hanging from the cross when he died. It starts out with a cool and creepy-like guitar solo from Mustaine. I like the sound of it. Then the vocals come in. Dave Mustaine has a really creepy voice in this song which gives me goosbumps. After the first two verses of vocals, Dave pulls off a terrific guitar solo. After the next four verses of vocals including a very heavy one where Mustaine yells some stuff, Dave Mustaine pulls off yet another great solo. The vocals of \\"Looking down the cross, speak no evil,\\" and a howl from Mustaine end the song. Another great track! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />7.Mechanix: This is another great song. It's about when Dave Mustaine used to work at a gas station and started fantasizing about sleeping with this rich woman who came there. This song has some of the most hilarious lyrics I have ever heard of. The song starts out with some guitars and then some drums kick in. After that, a guitar part starts and then the songs kicks in to high gear. Eventhough the vocals are hilarious, that makes the song special and fun to listen to. After vocals and more vocals, a great guitar solo yet again from Mustaine ends the song. A great song! 10/10 <br /> <br />8.These Boots: I'm really not going to tell you a lot about this song or give a rating to this song since it seems like Megadeth didn't even finish it. What I can tell you though is that it is a cover song by Lee Hazelwood. The most hilarious thing about this song is the bleeps that appear on it. In fact, the song ends on a bleep and I laugh at it every time I listen to this. I don't really listen to this one much though, I usually skip it. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a thrash classic and truely one of Megadeth's most underappreciated albums. Eventhough albums after this would have even stronger material, this is where it all started. This is a masterpiece of an album! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B007L3BMGA|1|I hope, I will never come across the phrase, &#34;he had his release&#34;, ever again.<br />It was generally a bad read. Reviews lie.

B0064X7FVE|5|I like this app with elderly family and family without transportation , I have concerns for their well being. I am awhile to see their conditions and call and check<br /><br />On them. It has enabled to guide them as to what to do for comfort in their area.
B0083ZRAJS|5|This book was great. I have watched the movie many times and finally reading the book has changed my whole perspective of Oz. I like everything about the book except it did not show the land of the North and its color. I would recommend this book to all Oz fans.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Some people have said this game isn't worth 5 stars.  Well, it's not to be compared to Halo or even other psp type of games... but for a free game, it's by far one of the better ones.  It has the perfect balance of challenge and progression.  You are able to be successful without getting bored OR too frustrated.  You can be successful whether or not you use real money to progress.  So, it is a 5 star game for being what it is.
B003KUSUG8|5|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Em fan and I have been his entire career. I was EXTREMELY disappointed with \\"The Re-up\\". It wasn't him and it didn't sound like him. Then a few years later he came out with \\"Relapse\\" which was OKAY at best. I only really cared for \\"3 a.m.\\" and \\"My Mom\\" on the album although a few other songs were okay. Well then I heard that he was coming out of retirement and creating a new album, so, naturally I went and bought it and all I could say was \\"WOW\\". He's off drugs, he's clean, he's sober, AND HE'S BACK! I don't like song #4 on the CD and that is about it. The album is arguably his best yet. My favorite song and in my opinion the best is track #14-Almost Famous\\". I mean Jesus he uses the word \\"antidisestablishmintariansim\\" AND IT WORKS! I wanted to go out and fight someone after I listened to it. There are very few artists that I follow through-out their whole career because they tend to decline or become \\"bleh\\" over a period of time but not this man. He has turned back into that lyrical genius that fans love and haters despise. In song #2 he admits that he screwed up and he says he's sorry to all his fans and wants to thank them for standing by him and that he's past all his mistakes and he says that his last 2 CD's were (expletives that I can't say on Amazon). You rarely, if ever see his \\"Slim shady\\" personality this is almost all Eminem. I'm glad I remained a fan of him through his difficulties and suicide contemplations. This is Eminem is his rawest form. HE'S BACK!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|From the very beginning of the book I was captivated by the book, in fact it was hard to put it down. The characters were so real and interesting to me. I hated to have the book end. I have recommended it to several friends all ready.
B00062PN6I|4|Bought for young teenage son at computer.  Has a heavier cable on it which is great, because that's why we replaced the last couple headphones.
B00ELE8D4Q|5|This is the album of Cher's career I absolutely love it. This is an album most artist never get  fantastic from start to finish. Great going lady & I'll be seeing you on tour next year!
B00J8JQ8GY|5|I've been a big fan of Pixies since the early 90's but I stopped listening to them for years and if I ever revisited it was mostly just tracks from Dolittle. I was really shocked to learn two things: 1) That Kim Deal had quit the band (even though I've always loved her work with The Breeders) and 2) they had a new album out called Indie Cindy. So I picked it up out of curiosity and I was blown away. I think this is really the best Pixies record since Dolittle. There are the usual bogus imagery and lyrics but man this really has some wicked jams! I want to play this CD really LOUD.<br />I love almost every single song with personal favorites being \\"Magdalena 318\\", \\"Snakes\\", \\"Bagboy\\", \\"Silver Snail\\" and \\"What Goes Boom\\". And yeah, \\"Blue Eyed Hexe\\" is their craziest rocker since \\"Monkey Gone to Heaven!\\" Haha. it's awesome. I think Frank Black (or whatever he calls himself now) hasn't been more energetic on a recording in a very long time. When you listen to INDIE CINDY you realize how influential Pixies have been to so many great bands from Weezer to Nirvana to anyone really post 1988. This is one of the best rock albums of the year and I hope it does well for the band. Would love to see them on tour, too. Would be awesome to see these songs live next to Queens of the Stone Age's live show for Like Clockwork. Really great work Pixies! I think everybody should buy it.
B00006JSS8|4|Great music!

B003EYVXTQ|4|Jennifer Lawrence, as \\"Ree,\\" is the strong thread that weaves throughout and borders the fabric of this fine film, making it a work of art that will stand the test of time without fraying.  With the exception of Garret Dillahunt, whose play and/or direction, as Sheriff Baskin, seems too squeaky, clean, and close to the surface for the environment he faces (and who is still too much in my memory as the \\"Terminator's\\" also-remote robot, \\"Cromartie\\"), the cast is strong and perfectly rendered, from the youngest, little sister to the eldest clan leader, and Lawrence's leading performance glitters with the gold of an Oscar, as a 17-year-old girl who faces the imposed responsibilities of a lean and rustic world with both strength and sensitivity as she works her way through obstacles which any adult with smarts would find fearsome, trying to prevent a tragic loss of home and family while never losing her femininity, despite her constant work, hills-tough clothing, and the sting of a bloody beating.<br /><br />If you might be inclined to think that a story threading its way through the poverty and clan hierarchy of an Appalachian-like setting would be depressing and of little interest, with \\"Winter's Bone,\\" you would be wrong, not only because of the smart script, adapted from Daniel Woodrell's novel by the film's director, Debra Granik, and producer, Anne Rosellini, but because the human struggle for dignity and survival is there, in the dirt with most of the characters, shining throughout and to an ending that, to get to, is well worth the watching.
B0042FZOFU|5|All movies look great. If you are looking for the movies with a few special features this is the set to get. I think it is technically a UK version but it plays just fine on my PS3 so it works perfectly for me.
B006UIUJ2A|5|This book is by turns intriguing, horrifying and fascinating. It has the ring of truth to it although it is not strictly speaking a true story. There is a subtle humour throughout in the common-place absurdities which are part of the insular and bizarre culture of North Korea. Compelling reading, I found the twists and turns in the life of the 'hero' of the story showed many sides of this strange country and created a momentum that made it hard to put the book down.
B0063GORYU|5|i can't stop playing this game.  i haven't played in years and i am glad to have found this app.  absolutely addictive.
B00FKF0F3C|3|Excellent story of the era
B00003CWL5|3|The movie is exactly how I just put it: 'beautifully shocking'.  This is the most daring role Kevin Spacey's has played since he was in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.  It was very astounding and at the same time, alarming.<br />Anytime you have a character go from a depressed (in a sense), lonely and unhappily married guy to a ragging married guy who doesn't give a damn you know you've struck gold.  Again, Spacey takes the starring role and runs with it.  Many people dub this movie as a &quot;teen movie&quot;, which it's not.  And if you have seen &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; you know what I'm talking about.  But this a great drama flick that topped a lot of other movies in the year 1999.  Anyway, Spacey co-stars with wife Annette Bening as they struggle through a bad marriage and raising a lowly looking daughter.  It offers many surprises, and the 'kid with the bag' is more than just a kid with a bag.  Use your brain a little here, people.<br />I give the director Sam Mendes a lot of credit in making this film.  He did a lot and was able to do it in just over two hours.  I think anyone who likes seemly-twisted dramas or Kevin Spacey would enjoy this one.  It's stunning.
B0010V4TZU|4|I bought Contra first and loved it.  While their debut isn't as magical as their sophmore album, this self-titled effort has a fine round of perfect songs.  \\"Oxford Comma\\" offers the best guitar solo I've heard in years,  \\"A-Punk\\" never ever ever gets old, and \\"Blake's Got a New Face\\" is my favorite VW track of all time.  There are a few songs I don't entirely love on this album, but everything here is good.  While I don't see it as well-rounded as Contra, this cd strongly defines their sound and offers a great 11 track listening.<br /><br />Hopefully they just get better and better.  After buying their first two cd's I can definitely say that they are a top 5 band.  This is where great new music is going, and Vampire Weekend's happy/rich/bubbly sound is ahead of the curve.
B00ICN066A|5|A swift history of the evolution of Homo Sapiens , the  single extant Hominid from its separation from the chimpanzee to its current stature ,  cultural and technological achievement with the potential of a future path away from natural selection towards intelligent design and godly power.
B00AF6MF9I|1|A descent game but needs a lot of improving. Game frequently hangs and h's to be restarted. Frequently does not update game status. Claims to require Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 but my store would not allow downloading until I updated to 8.1. Complete lack of easily accessible support from Gameloft.
1416594795|5|I found this book to be a fantastic compilation of past, current, and future scientific study of natural selection. While it is written from a scientist's perspective, and I too have that background, its messages transcend discipline. Dawkins' messages are succinct with clear evidence, and presented in a way interesting to many people. I highly recommend the book to all those curious about the argument over evolution.
B004XCUEU2|5|I love this album, the sound is awesome, 3 guitars with an overwhelming powerful effect! I really think is in the top 3 of the best rock albums made so far, but I like it so much that I do not remember the other 2!
B004TI5N38|4|This was a great book. I loved it. the only problem with it is I couldn't find another book with John Puller in it that I had not already read. I want to know why Robert is in jail for treason. If anybody knows which Baldacci book this is in please let me know.
B0085Y4JF0|5|good chest rig for the price. holds 6 AR mags, and can hold 6 pistol mags. you can also attach a kangaroo pouch with the MOLLE webbing. i recommend this product to anyone
B009FZHYKU|5|Great stories, great writing, great acting, great actors yours and the best make up and effects of any television show ever produced. The walking dead is easily the greatest program ever produced for television. If you're a horror film fan You won't be disappointed by the blood guts and gore and scare. If you're not a horror film fan then you will be impressed by the writing the acting and quite simply the story lines of this show make it five stars all the way!!!!
B00DQEB1V4|5|Excellent
B0081336FO|5|Better than season 1 by far!  Sherlock expresses his emotions in the most interesting fashion, and eliminates any ambiguity regarding his romantic sensibilities.
B00JVZ0DQG|4|Only reason I gave 4 stars was I was kind of hoping it was like the farmville 2 on FB and not a condensed version.  Other than that it is a Great game and fun to play
B00J3V8TD2|5|Alot of older fans didn't care for Clapton's mid 80's output becuz it started to get too glossy or poppy for their tastes.  I, for one, didn't mind at all & actually loved his poppier sound which was very refreshing after hearing him do country rock & blues for many yrs.  But, even though I hold those mid 80's albums in high regard, I still think that this 1989 album is an overall better one becuz it had a slightly more mature sound to it & a lil something for everyone.  And instead of just one genre, Clapton decided to mix up the whole album with a combination of many.  There are not only Pop & Rock tunes here but also Blues, Country, Folk & even Funk as well.  And they are all stellar songs.  Not one throwaway among the bunch.<br /><br />My fav's would have to include the big hits: \\"Pretending\\" & \\"Bad Love\\" which are very catchy as well as great rockers but I also really enjoyed the deeper cuts like: \\"No Alibis\\" which is an upbeat pop song & terrific duet with Daryl Hall.  The folk rocker with George Harrison - \\"Run So Far\\" is very enjoyable & the album's closer - \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" is the epitome of a catchy blues/rock song. Last but not least is my fav non-hit & probably the most underrated song on the album - \\"Breaking Point\\" which has a great Funk/R&B sound to it & a terrific beat.  It also has a really great (wah wah sounding) guitar solo by Clapton & nice b/g vocals.  I would imagine that this song drives old school fans right up a wall becuz it's way different than anything Clapton had done before but it's cool as funk & one of Clapton's most interesting songs.  I also think all of these tracks probably could've been minor hits on the radio if given the chance cuz they are really catchy, melodic & well structured.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a really solid album & you'd be hard pressed not to find at least a few enjoyable tracks on it.  I also think that even though there have been some shining moments in the 90's & 2000's, this is Clapton's last truly great album.reat album.
B00979CS50|3|Some really great material. Some marginal material. Overall, it is an enjoyable experience.
B002ZG9846|5|I loved this movie when I first saw and I still do to this day.  Had a friend, who was skeptical about it to say the best, and he thoroughly enjoyed it as well.  I always recommend it to friends who want to see something new.
B004V7XWEE|4|This Super Deluxe version includes a bonus CD of largely instrumental songs and outtakes recorded after the What's Going On sessions, a vinyl LP of the Detroit mixes, additional single mixes and demos added onto disc 1, a unique double gatefold LP-size jacket and a 12\\" x 12\\" booklet with two, large-print essays, liner notes and pictures.  Missing are: the 1972 live concert and detroit mixes from the previous deluxe edition. Maybe they should have released a 3 CD + 2 LP (original & Detroit mix) super-duper deluxe boxed set that included all this stuff.  -DW
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Its really adiciting and fun and its one of the best games I've ever played
B00006EXL5|5|Raw, haunting. Any MCR fan must have this in his/her collection. The only song added that would make it a 6 is \\"Sister to Sleep\\" as it exists today (recorded as either a demo or at a club by someone). You will play it over and over and won't be able to help yourself. BUY IT ABSOLUTELY.
B00KMX5V8G|4|I really enjoy playing this game, once I start I can't  stop.
B00AIBZLVY|5|I really liked watching this movie, as a matter of fact I watched it twice. Very thrilling and scarey. I watched it the second time because I liked it so well.
B000001ELF|4|ACE FREHELY CAN BE COMPARED TO GEORGE HARRISON BECAUSE LIKE GEORGE HE WASN'T ALLOWED MUCH SPACE FOR HIS SONGS BUT AS IT TURNS OUT HE WAS ACTUALLY THE MOST TALENTED  WHEN IT CAME TO THE SOLOS! ANYWAY TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT HIS COMET RAGES ON !!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5|this game is a very good game it is almost the same a the computer version. But it needs pressure plate and buttons and Redstone Redstone torches... but it is a very good game without those blocks . I think you will enjoy this app
B002ZG98UA|4|What is there to say, in this, the fourth go around for the better-as-a-game-than-a-movie adaptation?  Partially due to my fondness for the now venerable game series and probably also partially due to the fact that Milla Jovovich is, once again, kicking ass and taking names, I tend to have a soft spot in my heart for the Resident Evil series.  Even though none of the sequels ever lived up to the original (which, in and of itself, isn't a terrific movie), I was excited for Afterlife, the fourth movie but also the first since the original to be directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon and a bunch of other lesser films).  I guess, for me, Resident Evil falls into a guilty pleasure corner, wired off and surrounded by other equally bad guilty pleasures (the likes of which I'd tell you about, but then I'd have to kill you).  At any rate, here we are.  Fourth movie in a series that's been chugging along and losing steam.  And I have to say that this is easily the best of the sequels.    Watching the trailers, you never really get a feel for what the story would be, fourth time around.  Instead we're provided with plenty of action shots of items flying at the screen, pronouncements of \\"3D!!!\\" and \\"filmed with the same cameras as Avatar!!\\", which, after seeing the movie, is probably because there's not much else to the film.  It opens in Tokyo, at some uncertain time in the future, years after the events of the first film.  The Umbrella Corporation is still churning out bio-experiments which makes me wonder, \\"why?\\".  If the world is as empty and personless as it seems to be, who are they making them for?  Seeing as how society has collapsed globally, is Umbrella making bioweapons/experimenting on people just to...*finger upturned to lip* be evil?  Isn't that kind of counter-productive?  It's not as if they have control over their creations (the action opens with Umbrella goons shooting at zombies for sport), so why would they keep churning out monsters?  But before youcan dwell longer on this question, we have Alice times a hundred mowing down faceless Umbrella goons, blowing up lobbies, diving through glass, turned upwards and shooting in slow motion and basically ripping off every action sequence from The Matrix (which was...what, almost eleven years ago?), except this time it's in 3D.  Oh and there's two Alices diving through glass and falling, whilst shooting, a la Matrix Reloaded; two Millas > one Carrie-Anne Moss.    After blowing the hell out of the Umbrella Tokyo lab and losing her ridiculous psychic/clone powers, Alice is turned back to human (which is probably the only plot point in this film, and a much welcomed one at that), Wesker has vanished and she can return to locating her friends who she last saw flying away to Alaska in a helicopter.  Oh and we have another lapse of time, this time for 6 months.  What has she been doing this whole time?!      Moving on...    Once the film proper begins, we end up in LA and it becomes a similar structure to the first film; protagonists are trapped in a building (this time a more boring prison) and must get out/survive against hordes of undead.  Expendable characters are introduced, only to be dispatched, mostly off-camera.  Oh and to, I guess, further emphasize that this is, yes, based on the game series even though it does not resemble it at all by now, Anderson throws in Chris Redfield.  By this time, we're hurtling toward the ending, which seems to take longer to reach than the running time allows, and are given another cliffhanger-y ended to set up another entry and boom: run credits...oh wait, no.  We have a mid-credits scene, too, so don't take your glasses off.    Which brings me back to the trailers: 3D! James Cameron cameras!  Yes, those are the big bullet points and yes it's the reason to see the film (unless you're like me and secretly harbor a Resident Evil guilty pleasure center).  Say what you will about Paul W.S. Anderson and his directing skills, but the man does know how to stage a shot.  His cinematographer captures some awesome-looking shots.  And the effects are pretty snazzy, even though Anderson hasn't met a Matrix shot/gimmick he doesn't like.  Nothing in this film is even remotely original or as exciting as the films/segments they're based on, but the 3D is probably the best I've seen in a film.  And yes, that includes Avatar.  Every single film that has come out between Avatar and Afterlife has been post-converted to 3D after the filming and it shows.  The scenes pop with life and space in Afterlife and while Anderson uses bullet-time and freeze shots a bit too much, each one looks phenonimal in 3D.  It's pretty fantastically filmed.  He also brings a splashy style to a series that hasn't been filmed very well since the original.  Who knew that the thing Resident Evil was missing was Anderson?      So is Afterlife a good movie?  Oh no.  Not at all.  Why the four stars?  Because I enjoyed myself through pretty much the entire movie and was entertained.  Sure, it kind of drags on a bit and Anderson uses fade to black and fade to white so much that it feels like the movie never truly starts. But I enjoyed it, for what it was, and this is the first time since Avatar where I didn't feel like my $12.50 was wasted on the 3D.  Fans of the series, you should enjoy this entry.  Everyone else?  Well...the 3D's exceptional.
B000LXQVA4|4|First time mom here. My baby is 3 months old. I bought this knowing it would be too big for him (but it was on sale). He has become bored with sitting in his bouncer and laying on playmat. He actually fit well into the seat and was able to jump once I put a pillow under his feet. There is plenty of room in the seat for him to grow into. It's not too big that he slips out. He enjoys the lights and noises/songs. They (thankfully) shut off on their own and only restart with movement. He is able to turn them on with his jumping. He even enjoys the two things that hang down. He is still too small to reach the various toys. I'm sure I will be using this for awhile.<br /><br />A little difficult to transport so I will be being another one to keep at grandma's house.<br /><br />Pros: lots of toys to keep him entertained. sturdy base, no fear of tipping over. easy instructions. easy dismantling for transport to grandma's.<br />Cons: the pieces don't fold very small, making transport a little cumbersome.

B001ECQ4HG|5|Just got my bluray copy and checked out a bunch of scenes and it's excellent, the best transfer of this film I have ever seen  (I have seen it on vhs, the original dvd and the \\"2-disc special edition directors cut\\" dvd)    It's a high-fidelity digital transfer that looks as close to the original film as I expect most people are ever going to get.
B002SSUQFG|5|The watch arrived promptly and well packaged. Has a look and feel of a much more expensive timepiece. The provided strap is very nice, but I have already been using Velcro straps because they are more comfortable, easier to take off/ put on and the design of them takes the strain off the pins, should the watch get caught on something. I like that its automatic, never requiring a battery.<br /><br />Recommend this watch for anyone wanting a good looking, accurate watch for daily use. The days of dropping big money in a status watch are done for me.. Have so many other interests to put that money into.
B0000508U6|5|this is an absolute must-have! I don't have a wordy, &quot;music editorial&quot;-esque description for this CD, but instead, I am going to ask you to get this CD, even if it means having to donate a pint or two of blood to save up the cash.
B000000WHX|5|rough, unrefined, very nineties massive attack feel.  has all the elements of their sound, but in vestigial form.  this album is great, and the band truly gets better as they grow, with each album that they come out with.
B003TT4PFU|4|***potential spoilers if you've not read the other books in the trilogy***<br /><br />In this final installment of His Dark Materials trilogy, Lyra has been captured by her mother, Mrs. Coulter, and is being kept in a perpetual state of sleep.  In this sleep trance, Lyra can talk to her recently deceased friend Roger.  She swears that she'll come and save him in the land of the dead.<br /><br />Will is on a mission to find and save Lyra from her mother.  He travels far and wide between worlds to discover where she is being kept and devise a plan to save her.  But, Will is not the only one looking for Lyra.  The Church has decided she must be killed at all costs, before she can be tempted and return evil and Dust to the world.  They have sent a priest assassin to kill her.  The Gallvespians, a small but deadly people, are also looking for Lyra on Lord Asriel's command.  They are to find her and return her to Lord Asriel if possible.  Lord Asriel is amassing an army from many different worlds to take on Metatron and start a war for the Kingdom of Heaven.<br /><br />Dr. Mary Malone (from Will's world) has discovered a way to speak with the Shadows after following Lyra's advice.  They tell her she must leave her studies and help Lyra.  Mary follows the Shadows' advice immediately and finds herself in another world.  This world is unlike any other seen thus far.  It appears peaceful and more unmolested than most.  The Mulefa are the dominant species instead of humans.  They are most similar to elephants in our world, but are much differently shaped.  They have no spines, are able to traverse the land on wheels, and are a highly intelligent people.  They welcome Mary into their world and seek her guidance on what to do about Dust leaving their world.<br /><br />Will and Lyra both have a strong sense of what they feel is right and wrong and what needs to be done.  They will continue to fight with all their strength to do what is right and won't let anyone stop them, even if it means going to the land of the dead and the awful price that must be paid to do so.  Their adventures are tough and will cause them to be wise for their years, with many lives lost, and the discovery of the true meaning of Dust.<br /><br />Another great read in the trilogy.  I love seeing the different worlds and getting to see the different people and cultures that have arisen from different circumstances.  The mulefa's world seems more serene than most and more in tune with nature and the natural world.  I was amazed at the adventure through the land of the dead and the discoveries made there as well as the capacity of Lyra to love.  The mysteries that have been discussed throughout the books are nicely answered in this one.  My only quibble is that both Will and Lyra seemed to grow up too much for their years by the end of the book.  They definitely had to as a result of all they have been through, but I felt it was a bit much for their ages.  All said though, it was a good and satisfying ending to the trilogy.<br /><br />A quote:<br />&#34;But I stopped believing there was a power of good and a power of evil that were outside us.  And I came to believe that good and evil are names for what people do, not for what they are.&#34;
B001V7UXG2|5|I had previously watch these movies on netflix and loved them. They are entertaining and witty but also so different than your average movie. I would definitely try watching them the are awesome.
B00ECL7ZJ2|4|Googled the Target commercial and discovered the name of the song and artist.<br />Purchased the cd after listening to a few snippets on Amazon.....LOVE IT!!!<br />I found myself questioning where the heck was I because this cd dropped in September 2013 and I had never heard of them til the Target commercial (March-2013)... nuts....especially since I'm always on the lookout for great music...any genre.<br />The music has a bit of an 80's vibe to it which I absolutely love...(I'm a child of the 80's)...yet is refreshingly original and different from the typical pop stuff that's out these days.<br />GREAT STUFF!!!
B006IGZX0C|5|Excellent movie!
B00CJ4OMO0|5|Beautiful restoration.
B00BAXFECK|4|This book has a beautiful story that is very emotional. I really loved the way this book started off. I will say however I lost most interest about 3/4 through. The last quarter of the book I only read to get answers, but really had to force myself through it.
B00EJOCB4G|5|Great toy from Lego!

B006ON41FC|5|Very fun game.  It occasionally freezes, but is very fun otherwise. I like the goals. They start out simple and get harder. Addicting!
B006MW3UZW|5|Wonderful clean series, enjoy watching it every week. The custumes  are so beautiful. Great actors and actresses. I really  enjoy the relationships with each character.
031606792X|4|Fourth Installment to the Twilight Series.  Good series, this book like the first three is good.  The writer does a good job bringing the saga to an end.
1575666286|1|just not what you think it would be, even looking inside was misleading to me, save your money unless you really no nothing about nutrition.
B009FZHYKU|5|I have watched every episode of this series.  From day one.  Excellent.  I highly recommend it to any horror or zombie fan.
B00K7IPGS6|5|So happy they're rebooting this franchise after the steamers that were the second and third X-Men movies.  Great movie...I look forward to seeing where they take it!
0374530718|5|This novel represents a good start for those who want to read about philosophy but don't know where to start. It introduces the history of philosophy in way that won't get the reader bored by the theories and ideas.
B004SBS8LA|5|what an improvement!  if this is any indication, i'm sold on amazon apps.  graphics are great &amp; all the issues with the original &amp; seasons are gone.  love it!
B007SY3CEW|5|Fun!
B00026W82U|4|In a day and age where musical artists come and go and pop acts are a dime-a-dozen, Kings of Convenience are a refreshing change of pace.<br /><br />Beautifully minimal without the copious electronics, overdubbing, and processing that most music goes through these days, it's nice to hear a couple guys and a guitar making great music.<br /><br />When I first heard them, I immediately though of Simon and Garfunkle in terms of their asthetic and songwriting similarities. These guys have a little more pop sensibility about them, as witnessed in tracks like \\"Sorry or Please\\", \\"Love It No Big Truth\\", and \\"I'd Rather Dance With You.\\"<br /><br />Like most great music I come across, I discovered these guys purely by accident. I found a remix of one of their tracks which of course lead me to check out the band's original work. I was immediately impressed with their lyrical, vocal, and musical sensibilities and have been listening to this album non-stop for days.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this disc 4 stars was because there are 2-3 tracks that sound too similar to one another.<br /><br />Check out the samples and you'll quickly see what a refreshing change of pace Kings of Convenience are. They come highly recommended.
B006X50OPW|5|I found this very helpful
B002VPE1WK|5|Great bag. Holds everything and very comfortable.
B005RJ6AIK|5|SPENT THREE YEARS IN HAWAII AND AFTER WATCHING THE MOVIE, AS SAD AS IT WAS , IT BROUGHT BACK LOTS OF GOOD MEMORIES. BOUGHT THE CD AND PLAY IT WHENEVER IM FEELING MOODY AND IT PICKS ME RIGHT UP. LIZ.
B000088E6D|5|One of my favorite artists. Great album.
B000G8NXYG|5|this movie is amazing for any time.  and when you realize it was made in 1954, you realize how groundbreaking and unparralleled it really is.  This new package and presentation are outstanding.  better picture, sound, closed captioning, etc.  the booklet is a nice touch too.  beautiful.
B004W2UBYW|5|I am an Apple and Steve Jobs fan, so I found this book to be very moving. I recommend it to anyone who is trying to be innovative. I see myself as a lot like Steve, hopefully a little less abrasive. I see how corporate culture in most companies breeds mediocrity, and I love how Steve drove people and products to greatness. I became teary many, many times while reading this book, and I think it was because Steve really did impact all of humanity and human history with the tremendous innovations he developed. If you are an Apple fan you will love this book. God bless you Steve. Thank you for making the world a better place.
B00F1BFNFA|5|I love the first four seasons. The fifth season is rather disappointing. The photography is too dark and the costumes are drab. The actors don't seem to have the same energy and the camera shots aren't as good as the first four seasons. I definitely don't like the school teacher character and I doubt a person in her position would be so rude and obnoxious to people at formal settings or environments. She seems extremely out of place and rather ignorant. Most of the other characters are good actors and seem believable. I will purchase the 5th season, but mainly to have the entire collection.
B006MW3UZW|5|Per the title, my Mother's favorite.  I've enjoyed letting her find joy in this program.  It is a very popular program and kudos to them.<br /><br />Have a great day!
B0084U0IEG|4|I read this for book club and was not the one who selected it.  I had loved Atonement and was hopefull that this book would be as good.  I finished Sweet Tooth wishing I could recommend it to my friends.  That is not the case.  It wasn't a bad book but it was not one I would want to read again or recommend.
B0054JZC6E|4|the game is pretty cool and fun for when your bored. some games are annoying tho. and some of them just wont work.lil but its a good time waster :)

1480568104|2|I have to start off by saying, I LOVED the first three books.  I couldn't wait for book 4, after all, we waited over a year.  Unfortunately I was disappointed with book 4.  There was nothing new, nothing resolved, nothing.......but LOTS of sex.  That was the ONLY thing that was consistently happening, and I do mean CONSISTENTLY!  I felt like I was left waiting, again, for answers or an ending (something).  I am starting to feel like one of Gideons' jilted lovers. I gave it three stars because although I am a died hard crossfire fan, the next book better rock my world.  I am going through Cross fire withdrawals.  Ms. Day should stick to writing one series at a time.  It seems like she has too much going on to dedicate herself to one series, and its reflected in her production.  She is going to lose some fans.....and that would be a shame.
B000002GVO|5|No Problems and on time
B001CEE1YE|4|Received ahead of time!! Amazing quality
B009ZQP42E|5|I laughed, and I cried. Well written, well filmed and well played by a charming group of actors. The movie is about finding our humanity. I loved every second of it.
B00E8KLWB4|5|You can get lost in time playing this game.
B00AYR2FOI|5|Great CD.  Enjoyable. I've been a big fan of Boz Scaggs since Silk Degrees.
B007FG9LIE|5|I really liked this one!  I already purchased book 2.  The author did a great job of describing details and the story flowed real well.  I didn't know where it was heading till the very end.
0399255370|5|Fun. creative cute book for children and adults alike. As a teacher it can be used to teach point of view and argumentative writing.
0375507256|5|Loved it before the movie ever was.  (I like the movie too but read the book first because the structure of the book is not reproduced in the film)
B00B1E6FF8|5|I enjoyed the movie there were a couple of slow spots, you know the ending yet the movie continued to keep my interest. Its the type of movie you would like to see again later.
B00IRISI42|5|Great read! You won't be disappointed.
031623480X|5|I really like this book.  I saw Dr. Perlmutter on television and what he said really &#34;spoke&#34; to me.  I am diabetic and my Mother had Alzheimer's Disease.  Also, I have concluded that I'm suffering from inflammation which has caused very painful areas in various spots on my back.  I got rid of any foods with gluten in my cupboards/refrigerator and ordered his book.  What he says to eat is a bit different from the way I was eating but I'm changing my patterns and trying to follow the diet he recommends.  I will see my primary physician March 19 so will see what she says.  (I'm kind of dreading her response!)
B0054JZC6E|4|fun game to kill time. my kids are able to play it with minimal help from me. nice game, thanks.
B0041OOJNU|5|Out of the 59 albums I've bought in 2010, this is definitely the best! I got the album the day it came out and I'm finally reviewing it now. I remember when \\"Loca\\" came out on September 1st, and a lot of details of \\"Sale el Sol\\" were announced (album artwork, release date) and I was SO excited. I remember anxiously waiting for this album to come out, especially when I found out that Shakira was going \\"back to basics\\" on this one. I love this album from beginning to end.       The songs that have a \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones\\" feel to them are \\"Sale el Sol\\", \\"Antes de las Seis\\", and \\"Lo Que Mas\\". The ones that have a \\"Laundry Service\\" feel are \\"Mariposas\\" and \\"Islands\\". The \\"Oral Fixation\\" ones are \\"Devocion\\", \\"Islands\\", and \\"Tu Boca\\". All the other merengue songs \\"Loca\\" (English and Spanish), \\"Gordita\\", \\"Addicted to You\\", and \\"Rabiosa\\" (English and Spanish) are new and just have a \\"Sale el Sol\\" feel to them.       The album begins eith my favorite song, \\"Sale el Sol\\". Even though I don't speak Spanish, I can tell the lyrics are amazing. It's a rock song that sounds like old-school Shakira with a new twist to it. \\"Loca\\" is also amazing, and the first single she released from the album. Both English and Spanish have great percussion and music. I also love the video. \\"Antes de las Seis\\" is my favorite right next to \\"Sale el Sol\\". I love that Chinese harp-like instrument in the song. It sounds great. I also love the acoustic-rock feel to this one. \\"Gordita\\" is the fourth track and it's amazing. It kinda sounds like a reminiscent of \\"La Tortura\\", with pounding percussion, amazing horns, and beautiful singing by Shakira.       \\"Addicted to You\\" is another merengue song from Shakira. The title is in English, but it's actually in Spanish, because the only thing she says in English is \\"I'm addicted to you.\\" Anyway, it's one of my favorites. \\"Lo Que Mas\\" is another wonderful Shakira ballad that a reminiscent of \\"Tu\\". It's only 2 1/2 minutes, but it's still a great song. \\"Mariposas\\" is another great and happy song. It kind of brings something new to the table for Shakira. I really love it. \\"Rabiosa\\" in both English and Spanish are amazing songs! It's the best merengue track on the album in my opinion! It's a very fast-paced and dancey song with a very catchy chorus. It's a memorable highlight from the album.       \\"Devocion\\" was originally meant to be on \\"She Wolf\\", but got cut, and I'm glad Shakira kept it and put it on \\"Sale el Sol\\", because it's a truly amazing song. The chorus, music, and rock sound is amazing. Shakira also does a cover of \\"Islands\\" by The xx on here. I love the original, and this cover is even better! It's one of my top 3 favorites. I love the lyrics and the alternative sounding music. \\"Tu Boca\\" is another Shakira throwback. It kind of reminds me of \\"Escondite Ingles\\" from the first \\"Oral Fixation\\" album. They both have the same grunge-ish vampiristic-alternative rock sound to it. It's a great song. The bonus tracks are the \\"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) K-Mix\\" in English and Spanish, \\"Loca\\" in English, and \\"Rabiosa\\" in English\\".        \\"Sale el Sol\\" is an amazing album, and my favorite from Shakira. Every Shakira fan should own this album!    My top 3 favorites:  1. Sale el Sol  2. Antes de las Seis  3. Islands
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is a very fun game and which requires a lot of focus. I like how t here are many possibilities of getting something new. In conclusion this is a fabulous game that stands out among the others.
B00B5HQLMI|4|solid bond movie. good action, great villain, even a little nerdy at times.  No crazy parkour scenes, but still worth a watch.
B00BAXFACO|5|God's of Guilt shows the reader a gruesome and unsuspecting testimony the jury they couldn't imagine.<br />Dramatically compelling us to the shocking end, Connelly does deliver. Don't miss this one.
0525423842|3|ending.  Despite this I have to confess that I really enjoyed this book.  It plays out easily and while predictable it is a good read, especially for young adults.  Theo is perhaps a bit too smooth and uber-confident but one can let that slip. The tragedy of this book is it has no ending. I did not buy a hard copy but rather had it on my Kindle and I confess that I thought it had downloaded improperly.  No joke.  The ending was so sudden and unexpected, it was less of a cliff-hanger than as if one were watching a 1970's TV epispode only to have it cut at the end with the words \\"to be continued\\" flashing along the bottom. Yes, I will probably read the sure to be released sequal but I do feel a bit ill-used after not getting the whole story in one book.
B00004Z459|1|As Pop is dying, it looks like the world need a band to replace the Backstreet Boys. <BR>Rap/Metal, the new thing. The stuff the kids like...so let's make a rap/metal album. It's a simple verse chorus verse, a part in order to make the song less boring, verse, verse, verse. It's not like these guys would have done much for their success, it's music made for the kids out there who are unable to listen to anything that's even a little more comlicated. <BR>MTV's new favorites, Linkin Park. <BR>Yes, no swear word, ain't that great? Now the moms are satisfied too!<br />Linkin' park provides music for people who music don't have lots of time to focus on it. It's mainstream music for the masses. So highly recommended for people who prefer house and pop music.
B00846REIS|4|It was a good read. Everyone said it would be the next 50 shades. while it was a good book, good story, it is not the next 50 shades. It's not bad, don't get me wrong, it's just not 50 shades. I will read others by Sylvia Day when they come out. So hurry!
B00ELERCO8|4|Need some work but not bad. Thanks!
1449408656|5|I love the Cat v Human comics so I got the book! It's very cute and a very fun read through :)
B00I8Q77Y0|5|This game is just like the original that I had on my phone but before I got it for my kindle the owner took it off the market and I was sad until I saw this game so much fun And is actually better because of the music the color and of course the poop.<br /><br />Love this game everyone should get it.
B00FFT1BJ0|5|I loved the movie and am very much enjoying the soundtrack CD.  I am looking forward to when the DVD comes out as I enjoyed this movie, also and cannot wait until The Hobbit, Part 3 comes out.

B00NOPQU2K|4|Really good read.  Had me guessing until the end.
B00D6B4PUG|5|So much better than free app.
0792151712|5|I love this movie.Not only is it surprisingly accurate, but I found the interaction between characters to be very moving.Cameron spared no expense on the making of this movie and I believe it shows.Also, the beginning of  the movie really brings you back to the actual time of the Titanic.I'm not  a big &quot;Leo fan&quot;, though I am a teenager,but I have to say that  the acting is great.However, the storyline is the movie's best asset.The  movie is an excellent tribute to the people who were on the actual ship.It  is a glimpse through the eyes of a seventeen year old girl of what happened  on April 14, 1912 to so many people.I can't say enough about this movie.
B00992CF6W|5|I wish it was free because I love this game but I cant play it because I don't have the money to buy the game
B0015F1VY8|5|Since I have a deep love for Queen Elizabeth and everything that she had to go through, I I hate and love this movie at the same time. I understand and accept that it's a movie, and it does not all have to be based on facts, but do you lure people in. But some of the inaccuracies is what made me hate it. The things that made me love it where of course all of the beautiful gowns.<br /><br />I do wish that they would have changed Queen Elizabeth character just a tiny little bit so that she wouldn't seem so shallow. Because if all of the history books I have ever read depicted her the way that this movie had, I probably would have only read one and been done with it. I am kind of glad that I was born in this time, but I still think that part of me would have done really well in those days also. How cool would it have been to battled the Queen of Scots was Queen Elizabeth?!
B000MRA5EM|5|\\"Deep Sea\\" is a wonderful look at the one world that Man has no domain. As intelligent and resourceful as we are, we still cannot plumb the depths with the ease that the Ocean's creatures can. Instead, we plunder and pollute this wonderous world that we cannot conquer.    This film regretfully, may stand, like others that display the world's beautiful places, as the only record of what it was like before we destroyed it. There are many reviews that are critical of the the narration, or the Director. This film is not about them. \\"Deep Sea\\" gives us a look at some of the Ocean's most unique creatures, and how they, more than we, have areas where predator and prey call a truce, and do things for one another for the betterment of both species! It also brings to the screen creatures that many may not have seen before (the Sunfish comes to mind, because I, myself had never seen one).  \\"Deep Sea\\" is a feast for the eyes, as there is no trace of our intrusion (yet). Our children must see this film, and others like it, so that maybe, one day, they will be more responsible in preserving something that has fed, clothed and provided many things in our present lives, for our benefit.
B0050DIWFC|5|A DA's son is accused of murder and as he works to find him innocent he looses his job, his savings and secrets in his past threaten his marriage.  A riveting novel any parent can relate to.  Do you believe your child?  Do you tell the truth even if it harms his defense?  How can a family heal after suffering such trauma.
B000002IWI|5|This is the best soundtrack ever created.  Every single song is awesome, and I could listen to it front to back all day every day for the rest of my life.
B0036BK6MW|4|We really liked this film. It is a feel-good movie without being sappy and overly sentimental, and it's a true story. It's OK to watch with older kids. Good performances, well done. I know that some have identified issues with it (the movie isn't quite true to the book, simplistic/problematic treatment of racism) but it is a good movie.
B00STPQ8PO|4|It was ok.
B00HV8U540|5|Good  graphics and an interesting story line. I never read the book but was able to follow the plot. Using video games to train young people for actual combat is not a new concept. But the scope to which this is played is emense. I could see a sequel if the studio so desired.
B000JMKTLO|3|Very twisted family and very uncomfortable reading at some points. At the same time, very compelling and difficult to put down.
B0055PGUYU|5|I couldn't put this book down. The content is very scientific and fascinating, the delivery is as good as the best fiction writers. I wish all educational books were as fun to read as this one. I got emotional several times reading what's supposed to be scientific information! Great use of stories to communicate. Amazing style and delivery aside, the content of this book is life changing. Learning the habit loop is a very powerful tool to self analyze and use in organizational analysis. This book delivers practical advice that can be applied personally or in the business world. I'd recommend readers read the last 11 pages first, then go straight to page one. Don't skip the section prior to chapter one, every single page of this book has excellent content.
B006MW3UZW|5|It is not unusual for a series to begin to lose its quality in subsequent seasons, but that is not the case for this series.  WW I occurs during season 2 and you see the impact and tragedy on everyone, regardless of their &#34;status&#34; in society.  As in season 1, the &#34;sniping&#34; between the staff and residents of Downton Abbey continues.  I have identified both an actress and an actor, both of whom, have major roles in Game of Thrones.  We are now on to season 3.
1439163154|5|Each story lingered in my mind for weeks after I finished it.
B0051UP5NQ|4|Wasn't sure about it but I used the freebie and it proved to be useful so I purchased this one and was pleased.
B007V4QLY2|5|This is one of my top P!nk albums. It's a tie for 3rd place for me with her first album &#34;Can't Take Me Home&#34;. Many people didn't like her second album &#34;Missundaztood&#34; because her first album &#34;Can't Take Me Home&#34; was R&B and &#34;Missundaztood&#34; was pop/rock. The title of this album says it all - If you didn't like her second album, go listen to her album. &#34;Try This&#34; instead. The overall sound of this album is more grungy, but not heavy (except on the songs &#34;Last To Know&#34; and the bonus track after &#34;Love Song&#34; called &#34;Hooker&#34;, and on those songs, the grunge sound works perfectly). There are great dance songs like &#34;Trouble&#34;, &#34;God Is A D.J.&#34;, and &#34;Tonight's The Night&#34;, nice solid ballads like &#34;Waiting For Love&#34; and &#34;Love Song&#34;. There are even some sexy tunes, like &#34;Oh My God&#34; featuring Peaches, which pushes the envelope on sexuality and &#34;Hooker&#34;. Overall, this album is one of P!nk's best. She might not like the direction it took, her fans might not like it, and I have to be in the right mood to listen to it, but when I'm in the mood, you better know I blast it from the speakers. :) If you're looking for a good time, pop in &#34;Try This&#34;. Just do like the title says - If you don't try new things, you'll never know if you like it, and P!nk sure did with this album. &#60;3
B0064MPXFA|5|Interesting movie
B00DUGCLY4|5|this app is so so so so fun its really easy so you don't need too many hints! ya so

B00133KFGW|4|Freddie Highmore is remarkable as August Rush. Lost as an orphan, he is led into a gang of begging children run by their scary leader, Robin Williams. Unbeknownst to his mother (Keri Russell), she learns of his existence years after she believed he died at birth.  She is in search of her son, while Jonathan Rees-Meyers tries to find his lost love, Keri Russell.  The tangled searches involve the mash music of Keri Russell's cello solos, Jonathan Rees-Meyers haunting ballads, and Freddie Highmore's music genius riffs. It's one of those movies that will find you cheering for the characters in their search.
B000AL730Y|5|I have just finished listening to C&CITB and I can safely say that this is a very, very good record.  I grew up with the Beatles and have been a lifelong fan.  It hardly goes without saying that since his first solo album Sir Paul has gone to great lengths to distance himself from that history and to disappoint most of us.  On this album, however, McCartney reverses himself and embraces the past with relish and it makes for a fine album.  It's almost as if he said \\"Hey, it's okay to sound like then Beatles, I WAS a Beatle\\".  I hesitate to say that this is the best thing since he has done since the Beatles because that's damning with faint praise.  Within a few minutes I found myself singing along to songs I didn't even know.  This record is definitely equal to his earlier work with that other band.  Welcome back Sir Paul!
B00A81NFAS|5|Great for Eagle fans.  Very funny some times, lots of humor.  Not good for kids because of language.  Great for adults.  Love the ending.  Very nice!
B004ODLUGM|5|My kid's LOVE this movie and watch it daily...a few times a day.  We also bought The Gruffalo's Child and they love that one as well.  Very cute movie!!!
B00V4JKT52|2|I really had high hopes for this musical because it got so much hype but i just got lost as it went along.  I was not impressed and Im glad we rented before buying.  Bummer.
B00EQ0CKRQ|1|Every time there is an update for this app the update doesn't work and you lose everything. The only fix seems to be to uninstall completely and reinstall the new version. When you do the game seems to remember your accomplishments but not your purchases. No the restore purchases button does not work. Happened twice on windows before I deleted it permanently. The FireTV version is about to be deleted for the fourth (and last)  time. Too bad other than wiping out everything every couple months it isn't a bad game.
B0086700CM|5|this game is so cool but gets boring after I get all the characters and powerups. also it is easier on a phone.
B003NFM3JU|1|Would be great if the Bluray would even play..invalid disc error with ps3 and bluray player...Thanks Disney!
B00PSID6ZK|4|Htxmhcmgcljfkuycjfmu
B00D8CSVLW|1|Most boring book I've ever read. Only persisted due to other positive reviews which kept me hoping it would improve.
B003PUZ2NW|4|This was the first and best of the Rambutt series, a good action flic, w/ a moral. We treat our returning troops a lot better than we did then.<br />If JFK hadn't been assassinated, if Nix hadn't become president...if, if ,if...that VNam mess may have ended a lot sooner.<br />As far as I'm concerned anyone in the service back then was a hero, and so were the defectors.<br />Try the book, Lone Survivor.<br /><br />  Def recommend!
B00687Q0VC|3|Got started with the series. Haven't quite gotten into a rhythm with it yet.
B00PSLQGX6|5|Can't wait for Season 6.  Downton Abbey is a great series!
B004DLPXAO|5|great
1401235425|5|Awesome first volume of the new 52 batman..
B007IXWKUK|4|I loved this book and couldn't put it down. The fantasy world that I got lost in was amazing, but I was upset with Anastasia's character because she had the constitution of a wet noodle.
B00992CF6W|5|I love it so so so much it is so so so cool if you buy it you will love it SO SO SO much
B00009TB5G|3|Taken by itself, TTT is a wonderful movie with gorgous scenery and an incredible tale to tell.  It's a cinematic masterpiece by Peter Jackson, cast, and crew.  Unfortunately, it cannot be taken by itself - it must be compared to Tolkein's epic novel.<br />The main failing in this film is the warping of Faramir and the Ents from their depiction in Tokein's LOTR.  Tokein's work was at its core a classic battle of the outnumbered forces of good versus the powerful, merciless forces of evil.  The characters' motives are as important as their actions in showing their inner strength or weakness.  In Jackson's film, the final actions are the same, but the motives behind them are entirely different.  <br />In the novel, Faramir resists the temptation to possess the ring from the beginning.  He doesn't require instruction in its peril to come to the right conclusion, he instinctively knows that seizing it would ruin him.  Jackson, however betrays his inner strength by causing him to initially succumb to a desire for power and approval before finally releasing the ringbearer.<br />In a like manner, the Ents are made to seem self-serving.  Tolkein portrays them as wise ancient beings who are slowly awakened to the treachery of Sauruman and his threat to all of Middle-Earth.  They act against him out of a desire not only to protect themselves and their trees, but also to aid Men, Elves, and Dwarves in the defeat of evil.  Jackson eliminates their desire to help their fellow sentient creatures and shows them as merely grumpy old men who strike out at Sauruman after he messes up their back yard.<br />Both of these changes were unneccessary and betrayed the characters that Tolkein wrote.  This huge departure from Tolkein's vision marred an otherwise wonderful film.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3|ok
B00BVYNSLC|5|The acting and writing in this show are abnormally good. The lead actress is freakin brilliant.  There is some action and violence in this show but they don't go over the top (a la CSI, Law&Order SVU, etc). I have a fairy low threshold for violence and I can handle this show; though I wouldn't want my kid watching it. I wouldn't want my kid watching any show where characters are shot and killed, but other parents let their kids play incredibly violent video games all day, so it's all relative.  This is the type of show that you want to watch from the beginning. Trying to get into it mid-season would be hard. Once you watch the first couple episodes you could miss a couple here and there, but definitely watch the first three or so.
B00IK590UI|3|The commentary  ruined the movie
1878424319|5|A must read for all.
B007SYWFRM|3|I love the cute graphics but you can't get very far without purchasing acorns, so it's not really a free game. I am patiently waiting for the silver coins that might win some acorns in the scratch game....
B009MYARIK|2|Not Sophie's best. Very light read with predictable plot. There was too much trivial dialogue. Disappointed in the development of main characters.
B007RTAR64|5|The item was exactly as pictured. I was very happy with it.
B00006LFGD|4|What the heck do Barbra Streisand's politics have to do with her performance on these songs? If you want to bash Barbra's politics... why don't you find a political web-site to do it on? This is for reviews of her MUSIC! Is that too hard to comprehend?
B00NQ57JMI|5|Guys don't listen to the 1 stars this game is awesome I have played it since I was 7 so guys get this game I love having friends and its fun battling people and traveling so I highly recommend it for people who love adventure games :)
B00C5R7F8G|4|I found the history of the development of atomic weapons to be particularly interesting.  Having been in the Air Force during the cold war, and having worked with the Titan 2 weapon system, I am intimately familiar with the events that lead to the Damascus incident.  I was in command of the crew that Captain Mazzaro's crew relieved on that fateful day.  Unfortunately, Mr. Schlosser's sources were not entirely honest with him about the events that lead to the disaster.  The PTS crew showed up at around 6:00 AM, not 3:30 PM.  They sat in the control center for the entire day before being dispatched to the silo at around 5:30 that afternoon.  I called the crew at 5:25 to see how things were going.  I talked to Sgt Fuller, and Capt Mazzaro was just then dispatching the PTS crew to the silo.  Job Control erred in sending PTS out that morning because they failed to get their priorities correct.  Normally, repairing the off-alert status would have the highest priority; however, until the hydraulic system, HS-2, was repaired, they could not get to the missile.  We had shut down HS- 2 the previous day because someone had stood on the nitrogen line to the accumulator causing a nitrogen leak and the pump to short cycle.  Maintenance knew that; however, no one in job control was able to, or willing to change the priorities so that HS - 2 would be repaired.<br /><br />Crews, both maintenance and operations were in violation for years in not securing tools when in the launch duct.  It was compounded in this instance when the PTS crew used the wrong socket wrench.  The rubber grommets at the ends of the platforms had aged and were folded over rather than pointing up.  When the socket fell off the drive end of the thrust mount unlocking tool, it just rolled to the end of the platform and pushed the rubber aside.<br /><br />The whole disaster reads like a Shakespearian play - For the want of a nail, etc  It basically started on my alert.  I expected to be called in on the investigation, but the only question that was ever asked of me or my crew was why didn't the little plastic sheet on the LCCFC indicate we were off alert.  Things were so busy before Capt Mazzaro showed up two hours late that I never got around to making a grease pencil mark.  Everyone knew we were off alert.<br /><br />The Suburban crew vehicles we had would frequently idle so slow in RPMs that the generator light would come on.  It was a non-issue, but Capt. Mazzaro was very precise in everything he did, and he returned to the base causing an unnecessary delay in the crew change over.<br /><br />I can understand why Jeff Kennedy did not like Capt Mazzaro.  The attitude among PTS personnel and many other maintenance personnel was rather reckless.  They got away with it.  There was a picture (long destroyed) of Jeff Kennedy standing in his insulated underwear in a red cloud of nitrogen tetroxide.  PTS would frequently try to fool the temperature sampling device topside with a cigarette lighter so that the crew below ground would think that weather conditions were proper for allowing propellant related activities.  I caught them at it once, and shut down an operation.  The permissible exposure levels for the oxidizer and fuel have been reduced tremendously over the years.<br /><br />When I became Chief of Safety for the 308th in 1984, I was verbally admonished in front of the entire wing staff by the Chief of the Maintenance Branch for being too picky and for me and my staff hindering maintenance activities, especially PTS.  \\"No one was ever hurt from breathing a little oxidizer,\\" he said in front of an astonished staff.  He shook his finger at me.  The wing commander had just walked in, but no one saw him.  I could see the look of astonishment as the Colonel continued to chew me out.  I was a major.  \\"We flew through clouds of oxidizer at McConnell and it never hurt us,\\" he blustered.  The wing Commander fired him shortly after that.<br /><br />Complacency was rampant, and unfortunately is still evident in the missile business.  The fear that SAC used to impose no longer exists.  Things could get very bad.<br /><br />The author mentions the two man rule several times.  This has been confused with the Two Officer Policy which deals with top secret documents.  The two man policy involves safety and in any 'no lone zone' two qualified personnel must be in close proximity with each other.  Kennedy violated the Two Officer Policy; however, the rules completely allow for what he did under the circumstances.  All that was required is for an EWO (emergency war order) qualified officer to follow up and ensure there were no releases of classified materials or information.  Jeff was wrong not to seek permission, but the worse wrong was for punishing him for what he did.  We never understood that.<br /><br />The large tank, the HS 1 accumulator, that was hissing alongside the access road contained nitrogen, not hydrogen.<br /><br />I was prepared to be very negative about this book; however, I found it to be very interesting and an enjoyable and sometimes frustrating read in spite of some minor technical errors concerning the Titan 2.<br /><br />I would recommend it.
B00CS74W0C|5|This series was awesome. Couldn't put it down and now I can't wit for the next book to come out.
B007BT0RKG|4|It was good to be able to look at some maps without being tethered to my PC. I haven't had to use it very much but thought it was nice just playing around with it for a while.
B0083TXXZ4|4|I have only one thing to say... This Hailfire blaster is a huge advantage on the nerf battlefield. It makes the bearer a one man army. Literally. I go me vs. my brother and his 3 friends, and I still win. Only thing is, this gun only comes with 4 clips and 24 darts. Fortunately for me, I happened to have 4 clips from previous firearms, (recon, longshot, longstrike) and all I needed to do was purchase a 30 pack of elite darts, ($30 @ walmart) and I was ready to go.
B003L77G6A|5|i love this show! i really like how if you preorder a tv show like this on amazon and the price goes down they charge you for the cheapest price. i order many things from amazon for their great service and great deals. it was delivered to me the day after it came out. this show is hilarious can not wait to order the next few seasons! over all very pleased!
B00BGIC2J2|2|It had a lot of related situations, but not enough humor, and too much negativity. Funniest part of the whole movie was the mustache comment in the pool.
B000ZLFALS|4|Hit and miss musical. It's a hell of a lot better than the last time they tried to make a musical out Beatles songs (Peter Frampton and the Beegees anyone?). The storyline is generic, sort of like a TV miniseries about the Sixties; no cliche left untouched. However, some strong performances and some inventive choreography saves the day. Not everything works, but luckily no act is longer than 3-4 minutes, so just wait for the next song to begin. My favorites included a radical reworking of \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" (I hear it in a completely new light now), and the scenes with the Janis Joplin-like Sadie. Oh yeah, and there's the trippy scenes with Bono as Dr. Robert and Eddie Izzard as Mr. Kite that are both pretty funny. As an added bonus, the soundtrack (when not recorded by the actors) was done by The Secret Machines!
B0001CCY7E|5|Many of the reviews here have called this the best soundtrack. I heartily agree. The music is outstanding and really fits the grandeur of the American West. It's very much an epic score. I just finished watching the film \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and was inspired to buy the soundtrack.
B00UTJ93FU|2|Not very good.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I can understand why some don't like this book. They expected a love story. But this is not about love. It is about war. If you like stories about war and pain, this is for you. If not, I hear Divergent is pretty good.
B009E3EY38|5|I finally got to watch this concert after receiving for Christmas. I was BLOWN AWAY! I am a huge Zeppelin fan but unfortunately never got to see them live. I have watched Song Remains the Same about 100 times but watching this concert in blu ray was amazing. These guys sound just as good as they ever did. I know I will be watching this concert for many years to come!
B0058BI864|5|It's the Big Bang Theory, what more needs to be said? Great show, brilliant, hilarious, bazinga? all of the above!
B002ZG99TA|5|Unstoppable\\" is basically a story of a unmanned train out of control and the race to stop it by a young conductor (Chris Pine) and a engineer (Denzel Washington) that is about to retire.  The movie is a 90 minute thrill ride as we watch police, helicopters, news stations and all the Pennsylvania Railroad personnel try to stop it.<br /><br />The race against the clock train chase is a great thrill ride if you are in the mood for this type of movie.  It kept the audience spellbound. (Actually, all they had to do was disconnect one of the air hoses between the cars - I did this during an inspired moment while standing between two trailers connected to an unmanned truck that started rolling downhill.)
B00W6XM002|5|Love it
B004JN1D2I|2|I am very disappointed that after all of the reading I did, there is no more of an ending then there was half way through the book. As the author says, the book became too long to published, so it ended.
0060989157|5|This was a great book. It was written really well. Very interesting...from where they grew up, how the band got started, backstage partying, getting married, having kids, this book has it all! You will enjoy it!
B009FZHYKU|5|This season is intense! It's sad to see so many of the original characters go, but I guess they have to go with what is in the comic book. I lie the show and don't know of any one tha doesn't, but I will stop watching when Darryl goes. He is awesome and makes the show exciting and more interesting.

B006FO3ERQ|4|As someone who has lived on both sides of the U.S./Canada border, I found this tale of a young boy somewhat adrift in this situation to be quite engrossing. The writing is solid; the people and their situations believable
0345479092|5|This is a great book (recommended by my baby's pediatrician)!!  I finally am understanding my baby's cries as being overtired/overstimulated and feel better as a mom that I can soothe his crying by following the EASY method!!  Thanks!!
B006VRDZ44|4|Very realistic for the period in which it occur with some exaggeration but great show otherwise.
B00EY7LT9Q|3|Whedon, who put this together, put together the bang up job on the Avengers, also put together Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.<br /><br />With Buffy, love the series, but the first season or so was ... meh (okay) ... It was all about the later seasons, where the actors and plot hit it's stride.<br /><br />I'm getting a similar vibe here.  Decent actors for the most part, accents on some of the actors gets annoying.  For whatever reason it seems that accents are obligatory now, not a believer in that.  Put a good actor in, have them read the lines straight up.<br /><br />Their banter isn't up to snuff yet, the inter-relationships a bit predictable, everyone and I mean everyone has at least one major secret banging on the door, trying to get out of the closet.<br /><br />Secrets just seem too.... well, densely packed...  They should have handed out SHIELD scorecards.<br /><br />Still it has it's moments, the set devices (particularly the &#34;bus&#34;) are quite nice.<br /><br />Actors good, characters at this point seem a bit one dimensional, the James Bond type guy stoic, can do it all by myself, don't need anyone else.  His saving grace, he has decent martial arts skills and the fight scenes are generally pretty good.<br /><br />The &#34;rebel&#34;, well, decent eye candy, but very annoying at present, if she had a flag, she'd be waving it all the time.<br /><br />The seasoned spy who doesn't want combat and winds up piloting the &#34;bus&#34;, love that actress, but right now playing an extremely subdued personality type.  Not really using her to effect, but I think that will change.<br /><br />Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum, the &#34;Bobsie&#34; (Sp?) twins, beyond annoying... need to come up with a new word for that...  predictable... pendantic... dunno, let me get back on that.<br /><br />Coulson, hero from the Avengers &#34;OH he must never know his secret&#34;, like how he &#34;survived&#34; the Avengers movie after being harpooned and *chuckle* sent to Tahiti?!?<br /><br />Plots....  well, they push the limits sometimes, Can't say a lot here without spoiling the plot for those that haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />I have some faith in Whedon, think it will get better, but also though I've pulled the plug on my TV, I've found a legal source for the episodes where I don't have to pay for them (See Playon, the software product), and doubtless it's available directly off the web site.<br /><br />So, likely will continue to watch, but not continue to pay for this, at this rate a few days / week delay for watching this is fine for me.ti?!?<br /><br />Plots....  well, they push the limits sometimes, Can't say a lot here without spoiling the plot for those that haven't seen it yet.<br /><br />I have some faith in Whedon, think it will get better, but also though I've pulled the plug on my TV, I've found a legal source for the episodes where I don't have to pay for them (See Playon, the software product), and doubtless it's available directly off the web site.<br /><br />So, likely will continue to watch, but not continue to pay for this, at this rate a few days / week delay for watching this is fine for me.
B00BESM14U|5|I'm glad I watched this movie not knowing anything about it. I'm a reader and I'm not sure how I missed this one, but I'm happy I could watch it without judging it based on the book- it is a beautiful story. Definitely keep your tissues handy!
B00BZOFUI2|5|Not surprising with the amazing lineup, that this is a great, great record. With so much music out there one has to be somewhat selective, and I made the right call with this one. If you're hesitant, don't be. Buy now. You'll be happy you did!
B00KWVZ750|3|I love this game, it's so different from the other angry birds games. I would've given it a 5 star rating if I hadn't had to start over twice after reaching level 13 or so, for some reason when I open my game it won't load and it just sticks on the loading screen. After this I have to reinstall and start over! Please help with this problem and I'll give a 5 star rating! Thanks
B00AREIAI8|5|I love it funniest game ever up cartoon porn star wars episode was going through the lonely island and donkey
B007FEFLTO|4|really enjoyed it despite having read dozens of books on that time period.  fresh angles and perspective.  started the third book and it is a five so far!
B00GIXWHZ4|4|Iron-man has been knocked about a lot, his suit has been destroyed and his life nearly taken. BUT...he is never out of the fight for any length of time, and his ability to be an iron-suited hero is never challenged. Wolverine was a warrior I could watch lay waste to armies of bad guys and never flinch. THEN...he is shot, knifed, beat up, deprived of his claws, and in love, with two women yet! Bad guys generally get one crack at eliminating the hero, but in this movie they are constantly knocking the crap out of the X-men's coolest member. Why? Because Wolverine, for all his strutting, and for all his bad-ass clawing, is still a man who is susceptible to the same failings as all men - his love of a woman gets in the way of his common sense and natural intuitive ability to see a train is really behind the bright light coming down the tracks! Hugh Jackman is great though, really, No matter which gender, no one could look at this man without a shirt on and complain. Even the wounds look good on this guy, and there are plenty of those, trust me. The science behind the Wolverine has been explained in X-men and previous Wolverine sagas, so it doesn't really play a part in the film, though one bad guy wants his secret and is willing to kill him to get it. But, hey, what else would a truly bad, once saved by the hero - now dying, guy do if not try for immortality. I love movies that put an immortal hero into the role of the mortal man, with the weaknesses of one as well - otherwise, let's face it, the movie, (or book), would be boring to a fault! One star off because I really feel that Wolverine was too battered during the entire movie, despite the reason for not being able to heal instantly now and again. My problem, or that of the movie world in general, is that once a god is made mortal, why is still impossible to kill him? or her? We mortals drop like flies but the once immortal seem impervious to death even though there is no longer a &#34;trick&#34; to their continuedexistence. Admantium anyone? (If that is misspelled, I apologize, the metal is better than Inconel, the alloy used in gas-turbine (jet) blades, and is spelled correctly. A great popcorn flick with multiple viewing capabilities that make it as immortal among the genre as Wolverine himself.
B005IDXIL2|1|Claims to be compatible with Android-capable devices. After it restarted my device NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES during the download, I have to conclude that this app is, in fact, NOT Android-friendly.
B009KS4XRO|4|Its so much fun that its hard to quit playing the game once you start. Its very entertaining and enjoyable to play.
B0042RJWTC|5|I am enjoying The Tudors immensely. While I realize it has historical inaccuracies, the series does a good job depicting the flavor of the times.The casting and costuming also are superb. It has actually sparked a desire in me to study this fascinating period of history!
B008JGSM6G|5|I find this very challenging. I like the complexity (spelling?) this game offers.  Am an old lady, trying to keep my mind sharp.
B0086700CM|4|headline says it all, if you have kids that like to play on your devices, this one will keep them entertained for miles while driving
B002GYI9C4|4|I felt the internal logic was not always maintained; the author sometimes seemed to play fast and loose with his own rules. But the story moved well, and kept me interested in the characters. I felt I could see why a friend recommended it to me. Will consider reading more of the series.
B0086700CM|4|This is a cool game, although it takes alot of battery charge and freezes from time to time, the concept of the game neat and im still going to play it.
B000000W5P|4|A couple of clunkers thankfully don't drag this album from its position as the Stones' indisputable last cohesive--and great--album.  The listener is more than compensated for the price of admission upon hearing Richards  wheeze his way through &quot;Before They Make Me Run&quot; which contains  the immortal line, &quot;I wasn't lookin' too good/But I was feelin' real  well&quot;.  God Bless ya, Keef.
0064400018|5|My six year old daughter loves the story of Laura Ingalls and her<br />family. It gives good information on how they live long time<br />ago.  teaches her to be thankful, obedient, diligent and to be<br />thankful on what she have.
B009ZXT4BY|5|its like minecraft so its good but then there is spawn eggs! so that makes it even better way better play the full version tho.
B006ZCWU5K|5|For those of you who hate long reviews, I will sum this up in one sentence: if you liked Seeger Sessions and can imagine what it would be like to mix the old E-Street Band sound with this as rousing anthemic sing-alongs, then this one is for you. If you long for the Jersey rocker from the seventies who has musically moved light years above simple tastes, then move on, buddy! As a fellow artist, I can understand how Bruce is constantly in competition with himself to keep his material at a level that passes his own strict qualifications. The day that an artist has to worry about what the non-creative fan base thinks, then that is time to hang it up. (Notice that I have always refused to call him \\"Boss\\", since I was raised in New Orleans and never understood the nickname, even after visiting Jersey extensively).<br /><br />Most of these songs are rousing sing-alongs, but the lyrics are often quite depressing. Not many artists can pull this off, adding positive music to mostly negative lyrics (major key music to minor key lyrics). The only ones that I know of that have pulled this off with success are the calypsonians from Trinidad and the Irish folk musicians. Basically, the happy upbeat music was their inspiration to get out of their doldrums lifestyle, and it worked. When you are that down and out, the last thing that you want to hear is delta blues, although that was a quiet rebellion with a very different approach.<br /><br />To give you an idea for my taste with Bruce's music. I met and spoke with him personally shortly after the Born To Run album was released. I also liked the follow-up, Darkness On The Edge Of Town. However, when he released The River, I was out of there and did not even pay attention until he played the New Orleans' Jazz Fest 2006 with The Seeeger Sessions Band. I jumped back on the band wagon at that point, liking the follow-up Magic and filling in my one desired studio missing piece of The Rising. I had high anticipations for Working On A Dream, but hated a lot of it. Like many others, I thought that he was all washed up at that point, until this one was released. All I can say is that he must have told himself that if this were to be his last record, \\"Then let it be my best\\". His heart and soul shows on this one!!!<br /><br />As for all of you Jersey rockers who are bad mouthing this one, what do you want him to do? He is 62 years old, so do you want him to sing a remake from the seventies about his old street-rod racing buddies who hung out at the 7-11, and update it for 2012 when they are all over 50? It would be like who is going to take turns driving each other home from another colonoscopy and calling the \\"new\\" song \\"Darkness On The Edge Of My Gown\\" (hospital gown, that is). Or how would you like him doing one called \\"Prancing In The Park\\"? I will leave the subject matter of that one to your imagination!!! Dudes, grow up! Bruce has expanded his musical horizons, and so should you! By the way, that was not a rap-bit, but a very well done hip-hop section followed by gospel. Only Bruce could pull that one off!!!<br /><br />Move over Adele (but I still love your music), there will be a new chart topper in town, and he is not about to back down for a while!am, but hated a lot of it. Like many others, I thought that he was all washed up at that point, until this one was released.

B00HYTT7BI|4|Tom Hanks does a great job.  Makes you very proud to be American, thanks to our fantastic US Navy Seals.
B000FBFN1U|5|Great book!!! Better than the show for sure. I look forward to reading the rest instead of indulging in the tv.
B00005JMJG|5|Consider yourself warned...    I saw this movie based on a recommendation from a friend that it was really good.  \\"Really good\\" does not do this movie justice.  This movie blew me away.  I think it's the greatest love story I have ever experienced on film, which I know is a bold claim.  The reason I say that is because this movie is a celebration of love itself, and not the person whom those feelings are attached to.  Joel does not want to give up the memories and feelings associated with love because even though he does not feel the same way about Clementine that he used to, the memories and feelings are what sustain him and keep him going, despite the darkness and sadness associated with the deterioration of that relationship.  Love is what makes us human, not mere companionship.  Different people I have discussed this movie with interpret the end differently than I do.  Others have interpreted the movie to mean that they will end up together forever.  I think that misses the point of the movie.  I interpret the end to mean that they will break up again but the journey in search of love and happiness, however brief, is worth all the pain associated with its unhappy conclusion.  Life is not a fairy tale but that does not mean it is not worth living.  Clementine is not your typical glamorous female lead for a reason.  She is supposed to be real and attainable, the kind of woman that any of us could meet and date in real life, and many of us have.  We are supposed to understand why Joel fell in love with her and why he fell out of love with her, all the time understanding that people moving in and our of our lives is a major part of life itself.  Attempting to erase the memories of these people only does us harm because we never stop loving the memories.  A beautiful exploration of what it means to be human.
B008B0QH5S|5|GREAT
B008602KQI|5|riveting story and very interesting.  I find that books are way better than watching the movie....more details of thoughts and feelings
B00MASEPTC|4|Reviewing any series of Doctor Who is difficult, since any fan you ask will have different perspectives about which writers and which Doctors they like the best. I will just say that I have liked different aspects of all of the series up to this point.<br /><br />This series feels less internally consistent than the Tenant and Smith years. Peter Capaldi is a solid Doctor and I'm excited to see where he takes the character, but Jenna Coleman's character doesn't really have a story arc anymore. It's as if her great conclusion came at the end of series 7 and now they're not sure what to do with her. In the early episodes, there are a lot of references to moments in past series that hint at some connectivity, but I now think they were gimmicks more than plot points. On the whole, I am reminded of the Eccleston era in that most of the episodes in this series are self-contained rather than building on one another throughout the season as they did later on, and it makes the whole series feel fragmented and largely directionless (see also the inclusion of Strax and Co. in the first episode, whom are never seen again). My best guess is, if you liked old Doctor Who and the Christopher Eccleston era of the reboot, you'll like this series better than I did. If you liked the Moffet-led Tennant and Smith years, you'll probably find something missing here.
B00BR476TG|4|This was a decent family style movie, it entertained our teensager as well as the dults, though not stoked with tons of heart stopping excitement it was imaginative
B00B7Y0206|3|don't bother this app wouldn't let me download the app so mad..... I couldn't look at videos very well on my kindle so I want to show someone a video and it wouldn't let me install I'm mad:(
6305537798|5|As a 30 year old woman and a huge fan of Shakespeare I have only one thing to say about this movie: I LOVED IT! It was faithful to the original, yet fresh and fun. I think this is the kind of movie that could get kids  interested in old &quot;Will&quot;.
B000N3SSVM|5|One of the most interesting records ever produced. Experimental and haunting.  In a few words: it takes risks. And it succeeds.
B00102FELM|5|The Scorpions are one of those groups that Rock harder live than in the studio!!!<br /><br />If you haven't seen them live, this will give you a taste of what you are missing!
0312995423|1|Dan Brown would be ashamed to have his name as author of this book, if he weren't so busy raking in the cash from 'Da Vinci Code'.  The only reason DF is published is because of the current popularity of 'Da Vinci Code'.  I could not believe how bad this book was, not only in concept and characterization, but in technical accuracy and sheer implausibility.  'Deception Point' was a much better effort by Brown, and 'Angels and Demons' is also great. If you want to read a great cyber thriller, read 'Snow Crash' by Stephenson or 'Neuromancer' by Gibson instead.
B00KB3PZ3S|5|love it
B005ZOBNOI|2|Didn't enjoy this book very much.  It was very dark and dealt with death.  I skimmed over a lot of it because it just wasn't interesting to me and I did not appreciate some of the language.
B00FKF0F3C|4|Great plot.  To much sex when not necessary.
B0015F1VY8|4|I used it for my history class. It is not very historically accurate, but it's good. I would recommend it.
B00IK7NC9G|5|I chose this CD /DVD because of the guest artists involved. Great musicianship. Excellent representation of great song writing. Recommend to all
B00B0LPYXG|4|This was a very good movie.  The scene where Denzel Washington landed the plane was riveting.  I would have given it 5 stars but I'm so sick and tired of the f word being thrown around in these movies.  It would be nice to watch a movie without all the bad language.  Otherwise, another excellent performance from Denzel.
B004SKHJF2|5|Installation went great and it works fine! Not sure why so many people are having problems. I've been wanting this but never wanted to pay for it.
B0061S073A|5|perfect app if you don't want your kids accidently buying apps from the app store. you pick the app you want them to play. loves it
B0010V4TZU|4|I think people in general are over thinking this album.  I listen to this CD before going to work, because it puts me in such a good mood.  Isn't that what it's all about?  Why do people need to ruin it by worrying what groups Vampire weekend sound or don't sound like?  It's a great album, although some songs (\\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\") are better than others (\\"Bryn\\").
B0083P1QUM|5|WONDERFUL STORY, WELL WRITTEN, LET'S YOU SEE POLICE WORK IN A DIFFERENT LITE, GAVE YOU INSIGHT TO DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WORKING TOGETHER
B00DURGZHW|5|Great acting (both the kid and McConaughey) with a complex story that is well told and concluded.....Great Job! to all
B0000CDLA7|5|I don't agree with most of the reviews about the album being disappointing ....either they are not really into progressive heavy metal or they expect every DT album to be like Images&amp;Words or SFOM......I think every DT album is different...that's why there are the best progressive band...coz they are able to make something relatively new on every release....for those who like bands such as Symphony X, Evergrey and Aryeon....and also enjoy DT's 6DOIT and `Home' from SFAM...you must buy this album.....I have all DT's albums...this one definitely rocks....the instrumental stuff are better than 6DOIT...the best since I&amp;W.....guitar riffs and drumming are terrific.<br />The first track `As I Am' is such a good song...with a nice cool chorus.  The 1st part of the 2nd track...'Reflections of Reality (Revisited)'....is the highlight of the album ...excellent rhythm and vocals.<br />`Endless Sacrifice' is my favorite track...one of the best DT songs ever for me.....terrific chorus and instrumental stuff....from 6.35 onwards...exceptionally phenomenal.<br />`Vacant' is brilliant intro for the next track `Stream of Consciousness'...which is arguably the best DT instrumental song ever.  `In the name of God'...a brilliant track....the bass stuff is great....an epic song.<br />This is hard, heavy progressive metal at its best.....a good album that deserves at least 4.5 stars.
B0093ST02E|3|Quite slow at times - really not that enjoyable, just OK. Acting good was just not into it at all times.
B000Y7U98C|4|All though I rarely comment on a film I feel that this one requires it. As a viewer of many Sci Fi films and that includes the first showing of \\" the earth stood still\\". I believe that as an amature (can't spell) movie goer This film provides what intelligent movies demand. It is not a quick CGI ridden film but one that demands the attention of the viewer. In an age where most Sci Fi films depend on special effects and/or   CGI because they have little to tell, this film will demand of the viewer to think. It may not be the best film but it is very close to being a really good film.
B000AP04NI|5|Great, speedy service!  I will definitely buy from them again! Also, the product was in fantastic shape!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|A simple story, an yet, Grisham keeps you reading.  There were many twists and turns, coupled with times when it looked very bleak for Jake Brigance.  Grisham continues to be one of my favorite story tellers.  Satisfying read.
B0083P1QUM|4|Cornwell is usually a good read and this book does not let the reader down. Not a cliff-hanger, but well-written and an interesting theme and topic.
B001ENOB8Y|2|Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good.  I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with, but I will suffice with a complaint list.<br /><br />1. The plethora of plot twists.  Even M. Night Shayamalan would've said enough's enough.<br /><br />2. Bringing people back to life.  I know that they were never confirmed dead, but they were dead enough.  I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.<br /><br />3. The various coalitions.  How many bad guys can you work with just because \\"you need them.\\"<br /><br />4. The sloppiness of The Company.  Whereas the General wouldn't even say a word in season 2, by season 4 he was a chatty kathy.  He was equally careless with who he killed and how.<br /><br />5. The slipperiness of T-Bag.  T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing: if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag.  He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.<br /><br />6. The Scofield boyscout act.  In season 1 and 2 Scofield's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality.  It made you realize that he was no real criminal, he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother.  By season 4 I was sick of the \\"I won't kill\\" act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger.  Ultimately, that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people (i.e. the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull).  The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger... surprise the gun wasn't loaded.  Heck, Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.<br /><br />7. The resilient bodies.  I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast.  I don't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking, but as in their abilities to heal so quickly.  Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes tosuspended belief: manhole covers that weigh five pounds, concrete that easily crumbles, abilities to run long distances at top speed, etc.  But, I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified.  From the beatings, stabbings, shootings and other abuse Scofield, Burrows, T-Bag, Bellick and Sucre took, they should still be hospitalized.  Scofield didn't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed.  Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.<br /><br />8. My indifference.  In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat.  I was holding my breath with every close call.  I was exhaling with every escape.  I was enthralled by Scofield's detailed planning.  I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair.  All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4.  I was no longer at the edge of my seat, I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph.  And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4.  Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.<br /><br />The show lost its umph and lost its luster.  There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality.  It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing.  As the writing got sloppier, so did Scofield and The Company.  It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did.  Even the ending was anti-climactic.  The show would have been better off ending at episode 12.  But, being honest about the entire show: how sustainable can a show called \\"Prison Break\\" be?
B00AEBBAEK|5|Johnny Depp can sing. Not so sure about his lady friend.
1883398088|5|soooooo cool buy it you wont regret
B009MF56GC|3|it's not bad. best thing is the violence. disapointed at the picture though ..too grainny in too many parts. that's a turnoff. wouldn't buy again
B000FCKC4C|5|This book helps you understand the spiritual language of life. Everyone should read this book. It should be a requirement before you are allowed to read the bible.
B005HED08I|5|Love these old shows. No trash. No vulgarity. Simple storylines but somehow it keeps us engaged and wondering what will happen next. Sure the effects are a little corny. But that keeps it innocent. Good stuff.
B00F8L2VO4|5|Great app!
B00GRPD0J0|4|Works well
B00AKEMHCA|5|I got this and was like oh my God it was awesome I am defiantly giveing 5 star BUY IT NOW OR YOU SUCKING
B00BAXFAOW|5|I highly recommend this book. First, a big thanks for my wife for giving to me. Things are not always what they seem. This book points out Golaith was the under dog, and larger class sizes are a fallacy. If you want to have your eyes open, do yourself a favor and read this book.
1490313370|5|I am a 50 year old psychologist and entrepreneur. In the past two years I have read over 50 books on personal change, finding your passion, entrepreneurial startups, and branding/marketing/relationship development and promotion. Most of those books were worth my time, some were great, and a few stood out. James Altucher's Choose Yourself! is near the top of the list of those that stood out.<br /><br />Why? First of all, James has committed himself to being honest and transparent about his journey to where he is today--including his failures and moments of despair. This added to his credibility and drew me in closer as he laid out his road map for finding success and happiness.<br /><br />The best part of Choose Yourself! is James' recommendation that each of us is responsible for developing what he calls a \\"Daily Practice\\" of behaviors that support our physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. He states that we must figure out who we are and what is truly important to us from the inside out rather than based on all of the messages that bombard us from the outside. The idea that learning to \\"sit in silence\\" is a more fruitful pathway for discovering our passions than watching TV may strike some readers as obvious or steeped in New Age thinking, but to me it rings completely true.<br /><br />I recognize that Choose Yourself! is not for everyone. Some prior reviewers found James' writing voice annoying or found his opinions rambling and with no basis in scientific research. My experience was that James came across as authentic, admittedly flawed, and genuinely interested in helping others learn from his many experiences. If you're looking for the latest cutting edge research on behavior change or finding happiness, look elsewhere. But if you're open to learning from someone else's compelling personal stories, consider reading this book and Choosing Yourself!
B001UTW7QU|5|Very enjoyable.  Where do they get the story lines?  Very good acting and it lasts for 5 or 6 seasons.  5 stars...
B001RTSPVY|4|Sons new toys
B007BVOEPI|5|kept very close to the book, watched the whole first season at once! Couldn't take a break:) only to refill my iced tea
B004SIP6QI|4|yes
B00C1N9JWO|5|Kaleb is now in my top five heroes. It was amazing learning all his secrets and seeing what truly held his devotion through everything.
B008C20TDG|5|Easy to read and informative. A great jumpstart into actually doing the whole30! It really helps you to understand why the program is the way it is.
B00000GAIW|5|Aqualung is one of the all-time Rock classics. This not only Tull's finest hour but a bona-fide classic of Rock. <br />It starts with the graffic Aqualung about a homeless person. <br />Cross Eyed Mary contains some of Ian Anderson's finest flute. <br />To me the real finds are the acoustic pieces, Wondering Aloud, Cheap Day Return, Mother Goose and his finest acoustic song ever, My God. <br />Many have called this a concept album, it does talk about religion on multiple songs, but in my mind this is not a concept CD. <br />Wind Up and Locomotive Breath end a very fine album. <br />If you want to sample Tull and you dont have any of their albums you need to start with this one. It came out 35 years ago and still holds up to the test of time. That is the real measuring stick..............
B0012DP8A6|5|I love this musical and was so happy that I could find it after all these years. I was so thrilled to find that I could get it on DVD and not VHS, since my brother lost the VHS copy. The packaging for this product was perfect!
B0018PJEYY|5|great
B00DUGCLY4|5|I have no idea what the Man and the moon is but lol!!!!! I keep trying just don't give up. I spend hours playing it, and I'm only.<br /> level 2
B00JNQKR46|4|Excellent though my favorite is still Saturday.
0143119680|5|Unique,intelligent idea.  Extremely well researched, exciting,and erotic.  What more could you want?  Pop corn and a big screen and surround sound!
0930289234|5|This is one of the best graphic novels i have read. It captures you into the story and it is hard to put down once you start. The ending is awesome and the views of the different heroes in the book is just phenominal!<br /><br />I would recomend this to anyone who loves to read about superheroes.
B0017I1IZA|3|It seemed forced.  Like a deadline was looming and she had no good idea.
B006S8Q8W2|5|Loved the movie so much that I watched it 3x in the way in the Amtrak California train!!
B00EF44A2Q|3|Movie is blurry and I don't have it. Hope to get one someday.
B00DYEBM3I|5|I love it! They are even better than they were many years ago.
B00NEQRNVG|2|Was not worth the wait at all. Very disappointing
B00IS87HYI|5|This game is just like candy crush, but with a cool twist. In candy crush, you have to slide the candy but in this you touch the gems So COOL 5 STARS.
B007IXWL2C|5|Wow! What a well written book!<br />The banter and exchange between Ana and Christian was so enjoyable, I always had a hard time putting it down.<br />I've not read anything like the trilogy and don't think I ever will!<br />Thanks for the indulgence, Ms. James!
B003MC5N28|1|This book was really boring and had a very stupid and weird ending. I did like a few parts in this book but most of it was just boring. I only read it because I had to for school.
0385338686|3|I just finished reading The Undomestic Goddess. It had to be one of the fastest books I have ever read.  <br /> <br />I liked Samantha's character and learning more about her (she's very likeable), but found the story to be a bit too simple. There wasn't enough plot or character development for my taste. Perhaps that's why I read it so quickly. We barely learned anything about Nathaniel, and we have no idea what happened to Arnold or what exactly the scandal was. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed Kinsella's Shopaholic books, so I'm surprised this book came after them, because she seemed to do very well at developing her characters in the other books. <br /> <br />Overall, it's an enjoyable read.
B007SYWFRM|5|The app is fun.The level ups are fast.To play this game,you should have enough patience.
B00005LC1H|5|This series can be rather difficult to find as it's from the mid-seventies and British, so when I saw it on Amazon for only $29.99, I didn't waste a single minute ordering it. It's a wonderful series, full of realistic British relationships and true-to-life stereotypes of Spaniards and Germans alike!     Don't take me seriously. They spend the entire series making fun of themselves and other nationalities. And it's hilarious.    And it's John Cleese. Fans of Monty Python will love this.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is amazing I suggest every one  give it a try I love it people who love the movie will love this game to!!!!! :)
B004DK5CW4|5|My husband loved this movie and he is not one to go to movies.  He just suffers through one occasionally for me.  He ended out enjoying this one however and so did I!
B00AJLHUA8|4|the home movies were a little gritty, but overall this is a great movie. i had to turn the lights on half way through. the ending is really good.
B00V4JHNZG|5|Awesome movie!
B00004W221|5|My wife and I have watched this many, many times ... and NEVER regret it.  Inspiring film for ALL ages, young and old.

0930289234|5|I'll get the cliche out of the way right off the bat.  \\"Watchmen\\" was a complete deconstruction of the comic book superhero genre.  I can't imagine what it was like to have read this work when it was first released.  After walking out of the film having put this comic off for over a year to not ruin the most highly anticipated cinematic experience of 2009, I felt like I'd been hit by an atomic bomb.  All of the praises and hype and glowing reviews over the most celebrated graphic novel of all time did not prepare me for a story that layered, epic, and DARK.  I bought the comic the very next day.  I paid double what Amazon was charging for it at my local mall to avoid an excruciating 3-5 day wait.  I'd put off the legendary work of literary genius long enough.<br /><br /> Back to my original point, now.  \\"Watchmen\\" was obviously conceived as an all-out assault on the costumed heroes we grew up idolizing.  A human story with larger-than-life characters who at the end of the day were not only flawed like you and I, some of them bordered on downright pathetic and/or psychotic.  Gluttony, Lust, Envy, Sloth, Wrath, Greed, Pride; all are well-represented among the \\"heroes\\" of the dystopian  alternate 1986 where the story takes place.  Hell, some might say they are the stars.  But as jaw-droppingly bold as that premise alone was and is, that is barely the beginning.  \\"Watchmen\\" is an absolute tour-de-force of creative artistry, brilliant structuring, and amazing writing.  Alan Moore does not mess around.  Whether blowing up Parliament in a future totalitarian Britain, dissecting hookers with Jack the Ripper, or crippling Batgirl with a bullet to the spine, this is one author who NEVER  holds back and only needs one color to paint his desired picture of the world: black.  And this is his hands-down masterpiece.<br /><br />I won't bore you with details of the story that most everyone knows by now, but what I will do is regale you with but a few reasons why I love this book.  Rorschach opens the story with a noirish monologue in the form of a journal entry that is to die for.  Angry, spiteful, bile that makes Travis Bickle look look like the world's biggest optimist spills out from the blood-covered panels, letting you know without saying so that Superman don't live here and Batman is a big, mushy wuss.  And in a way, Rorschach is the heart and soul of this book.  \\"Even in the face of Armageddon.  Never compromise\\" are the words he speaks, andthey sum up the attitude Moore must have had when he conceived this story.  And there is no motto I respect more.  At the end of the day, this comic is not just a deconstruction of costumed superheroes; it's a deconstruction of our entire race.  An invitation to gaze into the abyss and know the darkness of the human heart, while still valuing it's worth.<br /><br /> While I love the abundant nudity, dazzling look, and violent action of the film, the comic shies away from focusing on cheap thrills and rather pulls you into it's world and makes you a citizen of it.  There is absolutely sex, violence, nudity, and fantastic imagery in the pages,  but it is often intentionally downplayed in favor of more intellectually immersive endeavors such as ending each of the 12 chapters with famous and darkly relevant verses of poetry and including reading materials from the worl of \\"Watchmen\\" both integrated into the story and as spacers between chapters/issues.  \\"Tales of The Black Freighter\\" is a  comic within the comic that one character can be seen reading while other characters talk about the state of the world in the background.  One almost feels as though he is peaking over the child's shoulder and reading this bleak and twisted story while people discuss the world's imminent collapse around him.  How you relate this tale of woe within the larger tale of woe to the primary narrative is up to you.  It may be the single best reason to pick up the graphic novel even if you saw the movie and don't necessarilyread comics.  I suspect the latter will no longer be true once you finish \\"Watchmen\\".  This is one of the shining examples of what the medium can accomplish.<br /><br />Each of Moore's characters in \\"Watchmen\\" serves as a classic archetype.  Archetypes he willfully destroys.  Rorschach is the classic hard-boiled detective with a traumatic past, like Batman if he were to go off the deep end and become a savage avenger instead of the troubled hero.  The line is a thin one and only a fictional character could tread it for so long.  Silk Spectre II is the classic woman who resents her mother's firm guiding hand and her attempts to fulfill her own dreams through her.  And then there're the daddy issues.  Naturally, she seeks sanctuary in male \\"companionship\\".  Obvious?  Yes, a bit, but throw in a crime-fighting career and the cliche takes on an interesting new wrinkle.<br /><br /> Enter Doctor Manhattan, who will be playing the role of God in this work of fiction.  No, not exactly, but the metaphor is absolutely there.  With all of the limitless powers bestowed upon characters like Superman and Silver Surfer it's interesting that no one ever took this aspect to it's logical psychological extreme before this.  Complete detatchment from humanity and eventual apathy towards humanity is the only destination for one who can see across the universe and backwards and forwards in time as we can see up and down our own street.  The Big Picture, as it were.  And what are we all in the big picture, folk?  That's right!  Less than microbes for the win.  Manhattan's cold declarations that life is a meaningless phenomenon when compared to the chaotic artistry of the universe is an amazing thing to read.  And frightening in that it is quite possibly true.  But Moore does end up throwing us a bone and does it by celebrating the wonder of individuality from a scientific perspective.  Now that's what I'M talking about!  Rorschach may be the book's black heart and soul, but Dr. Manhattan is it's most brilliant device.  Add a megalomaniacal corporate genius willing to pragmaticly weigh millions of lives against billions with no regard whatsoever for individual rights and you've got the best contrast in a whole book full of contrast.  Lastly, I'll drop some love for The Comedian, who's laughter is the true face of the war heroes we so often celebrate as aculture.  People whose job it is to commit the most vile of atrocities in the name of politics.  I like to think of him as Moore's answer to Captain America.  NOBODY makes a career out of death and comes out squeaky clean with perfect unwavering morals.  Nobody.<br /><br />Look guys:  I got through this whole review without a single political rant!  And with this book just begging for harsh political discourse too.  I heartily accept your applause.  \\"Watchmen\\" was quite literally written as the comic book to end all comic books. Thankfully, that apocalypse didn't happen, but the giant happyface crater is still there for all to see. And if you haven't seen it, then it's about time you did.read comics.  I suspect the latter will no longer be true once you finish \\"Watchmen\\".  This is one of the shining examples of what the medium can accomplish.<br /><br />Each of Moore's characters in \\"Watchmen\\" serves as a classic archetype.  Archetypes he willfully destroys.

People whose job it is to commit the most vile of atrocities in the name of politics.  I like to think of him as Moore's answer to Captain America.  NOBODY makes a career out of death and comes out squeaky clean with perfect unwavering morals.  Nobody.<br /><br />Look guys:  I got through this whole review without a single political rant!  And with this book just begging for harsh political discourse too.  I heartily accept your applause.  \\"Watchmen\\" was quite literally written as the comic book to end all comic books. Thankfully, that apocalypse didn't happen, but the giant happyface crater is still there for all to see. And if you haven't seen it, then it's about time you did.
B00005R2BG|4|well, after reading 50 customer reviews i've been able 2 tell that either you hate it, or you love it. i watched it and ended up loving it. Ewan McGregor is gr8, but i didn't like Nicole Kidman. i never have, i don't see what Cruise saw in her. But i can see everythnig that Ev sees in Ewan. (for those of u little Ewan Fans you know who i'm talking about, for those of you who don't: that's his wife..ooooooo, i'm jealous!!) newz...i recomend this movie 2 neone who enjoys dancing, singing, freedom, beauty, truth, and above all things LOVE.&quot; :) &gt;&lt;&gt;
B0055SWM08|5|Chill, zen game. Great escape from real world chaos. Very intuitive. Filler space to reach min requirement, which is stupid.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I love searching games. I also love how each time you advance in a level it goes up in the amount of energy you can have.
B009UX2YAC|2|Being that it wasnt able to download fto my kindle for some reason, we cant play it to try it out.
B008Y2X78S|5|Excellent series. Watched all the episodes in two nights.
B00FEMJF6O|4|Enjoy this game played the original on Facebook it's been simplified and really enjoy things are kinda expensive though to continue with quest lines
B009LMTDL0|4|I really enjoyed reading about the personal experiences by the author, I found them to be very inspirational and full of positive energy.
0790729377|5|All the critics agree about one thing: there had never been a performance before in American movies like Marlon Brando gave in A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE. I have seen this movie many times and never tire of it. Although Brando would make other fine movies, he would never make one better. Vivien Leigh is also amazing as the fragile Blanche who is sinking into madness. Even with the stagey set, which looks like a set, the characters explode on the screen.<br /><br />It seems to me that you do not compare Brando's performance and this movie to other films but rather to other great American artistic works: Gershwin's \\"Rhapsody in Blue\\", Toni Morrison's BELOVED, ANGELS IN AMERICA, for example. A truly great movie.
B00HUU13Y0|4|It's great to get an inside look at successful companies.  I have no idea if the ideas and concepts can be replicated - but the essence probably can ... hire smart people, give them the ability to succeed (and fail) ... allow improvement to be ego-less ... create excitement ... and many others.<br /><br />All those tenets are good ones, it's easier to do when you are are a relatively new company, but even established companies could use implement those.  Enjoyed the book.
B003ZSJ212|5|At 40 years old I've known these stories virtually my entire life, ever since my Dad took me to Ep.4 in '77.  And yes, I've heard every single opinion out there...but the truth is, the bigger something becomes, the more debated it gets.  And nothing's ever been bigger than Star Wars.  Personally, I think the naysayers often take more time to rip these films apart than those of us who love them take to defend them.  Because, honestly, what's there to defend?  It's the greatest sci-fi adventure/saga/movie serial of all time.  Period.  And for those who reply that the new ones don't live up to the originals...let me say this:  nostalgia's great and all, but I was around when the old ones came out; I read the comics, had the posters, ate the C-3PO cereal, and debated with my friends endlessly over every little nugget of those classic films...and the simple fact is: we WOULD HAVE LOVED THE PREQUELS back then. We would have LOVED THE CLONE WARS animated series back then.  Instead, we got the 'Holiday Special'.  In the late 70's and early 80's we had Star Wars comics with a green talking rabbit hanging out with Han Solo, and yeah, we loved him too.  We loved anything that was Star Wars.  And Ep.1-3 are far beyond anything we ever discussed or imagined.  I never wanted to see anyone else's vision of Star Wars but George Lucas', and after all these decades, to finally get to see the entire Star Wars saga in AMAZING HI DEF with surround sound makes this entire box set the culmination of every single childhood fantasy my friends and I ever had.  This series is incredible.  Do I prefer some episodes to others?  Honestly, no, not really; it depends on what kind of movie I'm in the mood for.  They're all tonally quite different, but cut from the same cloth.  In fact, maybe that's exactly why I love this more than all other movies.  Upon buying this, I showed the entire series 1-6 to my girlfriend for the first time, and her two favorites were Ep.3 & Ep.6...and ya know what, I think the ten year old version of me would have agreed.  Today, I'd pick Ep.3 & Ep.5...but I might feel differently tomorrow.  I guess that's the point.  A great series now with an amazing blu ray edition.  I'm happy.
0143034901|5|I must admit that it didn't sound that good when I read the back but I was urged to read this by my sister. It was great! Part action, murder mystery, love story. If you are familiar with the city ow Barcelona or the time of the Spanish Civil War, you'll love it even more.
B00785P2QC|1|Would not start on my Fire HDX. Removed.
B0000AUHQT|5|I teach this novel in the classroom, and this is the best version as a complement to the text. Students enjoy the novel and become very engaged when watching this film version. Very well done and a venerable classic.
B00J379F3O|5|Reveals interesting insights of one of the companies that shaped the IT world.
B00I9MS86O|5|starts out alittle slow but then takes off
B000007ODY|4|I would recommend this recording. The 4th is a little slow for me and my least favorite of the four symphonies. But the other 3 symphonies are done with the master's touch.
B00PRXAP8M|5|It was much better than I thought it would be. The depictions are realistic and had me gripping my seat at times. I will watch it again.
B000IHY9UW|5|This was the part that Val Kilmer was born to play. The music in the movie just makes you trip away from the very beginning. It's fantastic. I love the Doors. This is a must have for any Door´s fan.
B003ITZBVI|5|A lot of other people have said this is the best DC animated movie out. These people are absolutly right.<br />The animation is increditable. The story is spot on.<br />The list of talent goes on for days, but if this team comes togther on any future project I would expect great things.<br />I would love for the Red Hood to show up as some kind of cameo in a future movie.
B00CW665VI|1|The POV being only from the guy was an interesting change, but he drove me crazy! Every page went like this: \\"You know how __? Yeah, that's___\\" \\"You see__over there?\\" EVERY PAGE. I get what the author was trying to do, like he was talking to you like a friend would in real life, but I just wanted to scream, \\"Yes, I know! Just say it already!\\" I don't know if that makes any sense unless you read the book, but it was annoying.<br />I have to agree with other reviewers, the way Drew treated Kate at the office made me uncomfortable and he seemed like a stalker.<br />\\"I won't stop until you go out with me on Saturday.\\"<br />That's creepy, not romantic.<br />What is with all the guys like this in novels lately? I think authors need to learn the difference between love and obsession.<br />I really didn't see what was so great between Drew and Kate. She was good at her job and sings well? And I don't know what the hell she saw in him.<br />Another little rant: kids who are unrealistic. Mackenzie is nearly four, can't talk correctly, but knows how to add and use a calculator?<br />I would not recommend this book. If you want a book about co workers falling for each other, Julie James' Practice Makes Perfect is good.
B0051ANPZQ|4|This book is an incredible story about accepting people for who they are on the inside and not the outside
B000XUBFE2|5|I have witnessed Death taking  persons near and dear to me. I still see them in my dreams at night, and their souls remain in my heart. I have met Death myself, face to face, but for reasons beyond my understanding, he/she has decided to return for me at a later time. Perhaps it is because I have unfinished business in this world -  a thirteen year old daughter who still needs me and her mother to help her to grow and understand the complexity, and beauty, of the human existence. I hope that some  day she will be as wise and loving as Leisel Meminger. This book, more than any other, has given meaning to my life.
B001DJLCRC|5|Love it
B00000IZOR|5|wonderful, love it
B00004YRQA|5|Memory card works fine. Love it!
0792151712|4|I very much enjoyed this film, the effects were amazing and film gripping but why oh why spoil it by using two F words?   The film would have been Better without this.  Film well worth watching but  it'll leave you with an  ache and a general sense of glad to be alive!
B004I9CXHW|1|It only charges . Won't play through audio so disappointed in product.  Says not compatible
B0056XME46|5|Exactly as needed. Quick ship. No problems.
B00BU1DH1M|3|Once again Rankin has produced an excellent read with many avenues to be explored. A seemingly straight forward traffic accident but with the powers of Rebus's powers of observation and devious mind many other facets come into play. At first appearance many of the facets seem to lead to different crimes but like a purse string opened wide, in the end by tugging on the strings the whole series of events come to be interconnected and easily go in the purse.<br /><br />I felt this was an average Rankin novel and thoroughly enjoyed it but never rated it as high as &#34;standing in another man;s grave&#34; because in that story Rankin really went to considerable trouble to set the scene both locally and wider geographically and I felt this gave a lot to the book. However with this book being for the most part set in Edinburgh there is not a lot of scope for variation once you have read earlier Rebus novels set in Edinburgh
0792156684|5|I was not there when the Titanic sank on its maiden voyage. The story though was well known to me even so. A testament to the triumphalism of man...the Unsinkable ship...the largest and most palatial ocean liner ever to set out upon the Atlantic Ocean, destined never to reach port. <br />Quite simply, by watching this film I get a ringside view of the sheer horror of events as the great ship slipped beneath the waves taking the majority of those on board with her. <br />The inter-weaving story is sweet of course and there to create a beginning, middle and end which it does, and does well. Otherwise just show the film from when the iceberg hits and call it documentary, since the historical accuracy apart of the overlaid fictional story is not in question. Shots were fired into the crowd to maintain order, the third class passengers were kept locked below to a watery fate, lest they swamp the boats of the more life deserving first class passengers. (Horror on so many levels). The band really did play on...to the last and to a man.<br />The story was told in my infancy as a lesson in big-headedness. This film makes that lesson visible. I found myself saying a prayer for all those souls. Utterly spectacular. Utterly distressing.
0385340559|5|Anything by Lee Child I love. This is one of the last books I need for the Jack Reacher series. I have pre-ordered the one that is coming out, all I can say is please do not put Tom Cruise in as Tom Reacher, no way no how he is not Jack Reacher ever!!!!! I love all of these books, my sister loves them, and we talk about Jack as if he is one of the family, great books. Will buy from them again if they have what I am looking for.
B009ZQJ0ME|3|Maybe I should say George Orwell so people have the proper reference. I didn't care for the acting. I know that the story has emotions suppressed for the population to have a &#34;peaceful&#34; world but it just made for a very stiff portrayal and it didn't seem consistent for the entire cast. I can't recommend this one, I could have turned it off at any point and not missed seeing the end.
B004DM1ZQY|1|I love backgammon. The programmer here decided to make higher level game rolls weighted to the comp ruining an otherwise beautiful app.
034580404X|2|I was quite disappointed after all of the talk and reviews I had heard and read.  It did not live up to the hype.  The second book was a bore.
B004GJDQT8|5|Love Amazon
B000002UTY|4|This live album typifies the great performances by QMS that once was the standard of Bay-Area based groups of the 60s, such as Jefferson Airplane and Spirit.  This performance rocks, with the intro to &quot;Who do you love?&quot; It weakens a bit with &quot;where, how and which do you love&quot; (all continuations of the intro track).  It picks up again with &quot;Mona and Maiden of the Cancer Moon&quot;.  This work was recorded prior to the advent of CDs.  The contents display a &quot;side one and two&quot;  refering to those back disks that we used to be real careful not to scratch.
630575067X|1|This was one of the most disappointing movies I have ever had the displeasure of watching.  The plot wasn't even worth paying attention to, the acting was horrible, and the most interesting character, Darth Maul, is  see for about three total minutes.  When two talented actors like Liam  Neeson and Ewan McGregor are made out to look like cardboard figures it's  easy to figure out that the blame rests on Lucas' shoulders.  This movie  proves he may be a master of visiual effects (which are great), but he  needs some directing and writing lessons. And please kill that stupid Jar  Jar Binks thing.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show
B007SGLZP8|5|As always, Grisham delivers, and the storyline kept me reading.  Excellent  book.
B00005LQ04|1|is an understatement!  A boring plot line, tiresome special effects (which, by the way, DO NOT stand the test of time), and poor lighting throughout make this a movie I would line up to miss.  The only redeeming scene is the fall through a stained glass window, which is the only death in this movie that is worth watching in this ... attempt at the horror genre.
B000A3DFZE|4|Is a happy Eric Clapton a good thing? Is it really Eric Clapton? <br /> <br />Those are the questions that Clapton fans are asking after this new release -- Clapton's first original album in seven years. And the album's tone is decidedly up -- from the opening bars of \\"So Tired\\" we see a man who might be tired, but he's happy about it. <br /> <br />In \\"So Tired\\" we can even hear why Clapton's so tired -- a baby cries in the background of the song. The song is infectuous, and very happy. <br /> <br />\\"Say What You Will\\" has potential to be a sad song -- \\"Say what you will/good love is hard to find./And I've had my fill/of the hurting kind.\\" But it's a song about good love -- \\"You found the best in me.\\" It's a happy song because of the sadness that went before it. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Going Left\\" is a song about changes -- and there's a shade of spiritual content in the song, talking about spiritual changes in life. The song is tinged with Gospel influences, including the backing vocals. I can see myself singing along with this one in the car. <br /> <br />\\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" -- four songs in, and we hit a blues-tinged ballad. A heart-sick, broken hearted song, this is the first time we hear a even a hint of sadness on the album. <br /> <br />I won't go all the way through the playlist. One of the complaints I've heard from Clapton fans is that the album is too 'up' for an Eric Clapton album. And \\"Love Don't Love Nobody\\" is a strong track, probably stronger than most on the album. But Clapton writes what is true for him -- a quick look at the credits shows that he wrote the happiest-sounding songs on the disc. He's a happy man -- and a happy man can't sing the blues (if that isn't a song, it should be!). <br /> <br />One other complaint I've heard is that the album neglects Clapton's guitar skills. I'll have to admit that I agree here -- I was looking for more guitar work than is on this album. \\"Lost and Found\\" and \\"Piece Of My Heart\\" are both great blues-rockers, and feature some good guitar licks, but the album fell short of my expectations in this area. Those two tracks, along with \\"Revolution\\" (which I reviewed previously) are probably my favorites on the album. <br /> <br />This one wasn't what I expected, but it's earned a place in the collection. It's a fun CD, and a welcome release. Seven years is, after all, a long time to wait.
B007SGM084|5|Great book...wonderfully written!! Couldn't put it down!! Devoured all three books in a week!! Oh Mr. Gray......how you make me blush ;)

B000N0WCLC|5|This is an excellent film that intertwines personal struggle, questioning of morals, action, and truthful insight into the very controversial existence of blood diamonds. Great actors propel this story throughout the entire film and there are numerous intense scenes!
B008Y2FRFO|1|Honestly this game is a dud. It promises excitement but all you do is push coins to collect coins and prizes. It is so boring and you never have enough coins to get more coins. It is annoyingly slow and will make you feel like your brain is falling out. I wouldn't recommend it even to my worst enemy just because it would be cruel to do so. The only pros that this game has is pretty objects to collect. It is equivalent to torture.
B00HUCF420|5|One of the best TV series to come along in some time. The atmosphere is always dark and menacing, and it's unclear as to the direction the story is going. First-rate acting from both McConnaughey, and Harrelson holds his own. So far I've seen the first 6 episodes. My only disappointment is that the 6th disc has a glitch and skips over part of the story - I can't tell how much. Hopefully the remaining 2 discs will be okay, but I would have expected that new out-of-the-box discs would play perfectly.

B003G4W49C|2|The majority of the book was interesting and enjoyable enough. The themes weren't super strong - like he couldn't quite get his message across. Still, I would have rated it a solid 3 stars. Until the rambling ending, which went off in even more directions that didn't need it.
0780624890|1|I thought this movie had great action, great special effects, and terrible writing.  Everything that happens in the movie is a cheesy, overdone cliche - but if you don't care about well-written movies, it's an entertaining  action flick.  I personally thought it was terrible, but some people love  this kind of movie.

0689835604|3|This book is just okay. The flaps are very large. My daughter is not a huge fan of this one.
B00006L83N|4|Ok, first i really like this cd evryone is super talented.  HOwever thi is not my opinion of great.  MIchael romeo is an outstanding guitarist its just that he sounds a bit too much like a certain swede, noneheless he can really play its jsut that it is somewhat unoriginal.  his riffs are very heavy and have great tone.  Many people compare this band to dream theater an i definitely see the comparisons, at points it sounds lie dream theater with yngwie playing the solos.  Also many people compare michael romeo to john petrucci, in my opinion i see petrucci as being a much better guitarist he has more muscle in his playing where as romeo is vry delicte in his touch on the solos.  Also petrucci can be in credibly melodic at times and once again i find romeos playing to be a little unoriginal and repetitive.  NOw though the singer from symphony x blows James la Brie away a agreat vocalist for this genre.  All in all i recommend this cd but, it does not deserve the hype it gets
B007I2BZIE|4|Good news and bad news. First the good news: The music is great. Absolutely astounding at times and is a lot to take in with just one listen. Rush does a lot of new and innovative playing on this album. Now the Bad news: The melodies of the vocals gets monotonous. Almost as if Geddy's singing the same song over and over again. Nothing very memorable here. I also get the feeling that I heard a lot of these vocal melodies before over the last 5 Rush albums. Additional good news: Some of the best guitar soloing I ever heard Alex play. Certainly worth a listen.
B005LAII12|2|I watched the unrated version with my wife and we both hated Ted.  First off I am ok with the idea of a raunch talking teddy after all I watch Wilfred and love that show so I am ok with the idea of Ted.  I just felt Ted the character was not funny nor was the character well developed and I would have liked to see Ted take the rauchiness further.  I also had trouble with Teds voice since it was done by Seth McFarland I kept thinking I was watching a boring episode of family guy.  The plot was somewhat predictible nothing to write home about.  I have recently seen some Adam Sandler movies and been disappointed so perhaps my tastes are maturing as I get older but Ted did very little for me or my wife.  However two younger people in my office (early 20's) loved the movie and qoute it all day long and sing the Thunder Buddies song at least once a week.
B00AB7HESI|5|I got this game about a week ago and finished yesterday but I loved it so much I got it again. I love this game and I think you will to try it you might like it.
B00000I8UE|5|I've only owned &quot;Traveling&quot; for four days, but I have not stopped listening since the first note. Every time I listen I choose a different song as my favorite of the album. Her voice soothes and exites.  Her writing has moved forward since &quot;Blue Light 'til Dawn&quot; which  has just lost it's spot as my favorite. Buy the C.D. NOW!!!!!!!!!

B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved this book!! Very sad but very insightful. I would definitely recommend you read this before you see the movie.
B001KVZ6G6|2|This is a review of the movie - not the dvd or the packaging like most other reviews.   The movie starts of very well - but once they house lands in the strange world of dogs and annoying road runner bird - it completely falls down.  the dogs are annoying - no humor - the bird is goofy.  I was very disappointed overall with the movie.   \\"maybe\\" worth watching once - but not a classic by any stretch of the imagination...
B0013D8LOU|2|Ed Sanders and Helena Bonham Carter. Their interpretations of Sondheim, alhough I remember images of Angela Lansbury and the sound of her brillint voice, are all ace.<br /><br />Mr Depp lacks both the psysique and the voice to carry the role of Sweeney. It is adequate nothing more. The same goes for Tim Burton who seems to be long lost in the world of Gothic.... there are never any surprises.....<br /><br />Another letown is the bluescreen, matte etc.... It looks like you are watching a cartoon.... What happened to good old set work eyyyy??????<br /><br />The third letdown is that the virtues of this musical are strictly theatrical rather than cinematic... It doesn`t and DON`T make the travel to the screen easily. I love the world of musical; but when Anthony Hope leaves Johanna singing after being kicked - it`s just too much....<br /><br />On the screen is looks silly...<br /><br />And ..... why couldn`t they give the lead of Sweeney to an actor with a singingtalent??? In the 60s and 70s - the musical genre died out due to facts including the chorus only being in trained voices(Camelot comes to mind for one) and overlong and overbudgeted products(Hello Dolly, Song of Norway, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever....)<br /><br />But great orchestrations and the three actors mentioned remains a treat.

0385340567|1|I've read all the previous Jack Reacher novels and was looking forward to this one.  Ughh!  What a disappointment.  I never thought I'd say this about a Jack Reacher novel, but \\"Nothing To Lose\\" is really boring.  Normally, Lee Child includes some interesting minutae to show how Reacher's mind works.  But \\"Nothing To Lose\\" was loaded with minutae that was tedious.  The following is a parody, but the book was filled with passages like:  \\"Reacher decided to brush his teeth.  He brushed them twice a day.  Sometimes three times.  They were pretty good teeth.  He'd only had three cavities in his life.  One was filled with gold, two with amalgam.  He pulled the collapsible toothbrush from his pocket.  Except for his money and an expired passport, it was the only item Reacher carried.  It was lavender.  Reacher had been given a choice of pink, blue, white or lavender.  He had chosen lavender.  He unfolded the toothbrush.  It was plastic, with a metal hinge.  The bristles were neither old nor new.  Reacher opened his mouth and began brushing.  He brushed his right rear molars first.  He used an up and down motion, making sure to brush gently along the gum line.  He did not use toothpaste.  Most of the time, toothpaste was not available.  Reacher had used toothpaste from time to time in the past, but didn't think enough of it to fill another of his pockets.\\"  Etc., etc. ad nauseum.
B00AGJ4HC2|5|Great little card game. Do not be misled by the title, which does provide a context or backdrop for the game, but actually has kettle to do with the game mechanics. However, it is a quick & easy to learn/teach and play. Best with 3-4 players. Also easy to carry around with you and have handy. A nice, short, little filler game!
0140861645|4|These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks.  It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive.  My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete.  Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere.  I would recommend it.
B00003CXCT|5|What a great package! Episodes 4,5 & 6 like we,ve never seen them before! The way LUCAS wanted us to see them & then a 4th dvd with endless material that any true STARWARS fan will enjoy. As for the changes LUCAS made, I LOVE THEM! they make the movies that much better than they already we,re & they will also fit better with episodes 1,2 & 3 now.
B002QW7AJY|4|Awesome Movie that no one knew about!!! Price is high right now for it though, but i'm sure by the time it releases it will be down to the normal prices. This movie is very worth $20 to buy if it gets down to that price, which i'm sure it will.
0062082353|5|I thought it was a well written autobiography about a brave man and the men he worked with would deffinitly recommend reading it!!!

B004I8WD6E|5|Great little phone case at an excellent cost.  It's a little difficult to bend to get it over the phone, but once applied, it stays in place. I have gotten several questions on where I got the study little case.
6300274268|5|We got the tape which play very good like exactly described it. Our kids were very happy by their collections. Thank you so much & have a good day!
B009C7ZQM4|5|I got this app to clean all the files I couldn't find In my kindle and it exceeded my expectations you can clean all sorts of things, this is probably one of the best cleaning apps I ever used hands down.
B000G73U5Y|5|This is a fantastic collection of some of the most underrated yet outstanding hits. Each one is filled with rich, upbeat heart and soul, while delivering music that will stay with you, as it has stayed with me for many years. This CD is one you will be glad you bought, you'll treasure it!  - \\"I'm ready to walk that fine line...\\"
B002MQYOFW|5|I could not put this book down and I was so glad there were two more after this one! I loved this series -SOOO Glad I read the book before seeing the movie though - my husband didn't get into the movie as much as I did because he didn't read the book first. I felt like I knew what was going on in her head and had to explain So much to him throughout the movie! Great books though! :)
B0094M6A18|1|Very slow and boring to me. I only watched a few minutes and gave up.
0062218336|4|I really like this book but honestly it was a slower read than the preducerors and understand this book is formated differently.  Still I enjoyed this third book, movie and listen to the podcasts regularly.
B00A0A6F7C|5|I believe this is one of her best and I like the idea of supporting good music&singers like her.Her music is uplifting&soothing to the spirit.
B001G0MFOM|2|It wasn't as good as they said the product would be :( discs were scratched & some of it is not playable but other than that everything else was as expected
0671646788|3|The book was in good condition.  The problem was that the print was smaller and there were less pages in the book dur to smaller print.  I did not like that.  I already own the book (pictured to the right) and when this version arrived, I did not care for it.  I ordered this copy for my son, and I did not really want the print to be smaller.
B00E4TSNCK|5|BETTER THAN 2014
B006Q2LTRO|4|Very satisfied.  I ordered another copy for a relative.  Book was is great condition.
B0016HNOXQ|5|It takes a while to sink in, but once it does you won't stop listening...over and over again....it's addictive and I know it sounds like cliches but it's true...you'll find layers of sounds and emotions, so raw and real and in your face it's sometimes discomforting, it's like all those feelings you've felt, that anger, that frustration, that joy and bliss put into music and words....beyond belief...really, give it a try.
B004VD3YIM|5|Changing my review. The author has been releasing updates to both Google and Amazon. Perfect app for just about any ip camera there is.
B00BJ9VBLI|4|I really enjoy this game because it is challenging, yet I can take my time and not have to rush it. You get to a certain level and then if you want to continue, you have to buy it for just a couple dollars. I recommend you try it and I'm sure you will buy it too!!
0790743523|5|This is a classic story by a mysterious author of the lengths to which human beings will be driven by greed and the folly of their efforts.  Set in Mexico, Walter Huston, plays an Academy Award winning role as the old prospector.  He is directed by his son, John, who appears in an interesting  cameo early in the film and who also won an Oscar for this film in 1948.   Robert Blake, as a child actor, plays an important part in the story.   Bogart is beliveable as the greed-crazed fortune hunter.
B000001EGA|5|What can I say it is Sir Elton John!  This was a replacement to my daughter's collection.  It arrived very promptly; the price was excellent; we are very satisfied.
B006LSZECO|5|Excellent read!
B00CE3IC74|5|These work exactly as expected with my Galaxy S4. I didn't notice the free bonus tag when I bought the 10 + the key chain, so I was pleasantly surprised.
1250006341|5|This is a beautiful book / keepsake of the fab series. I gave it to my mother, a big fan, as a gift.
B00KF7OOIW|4|Great acting!
B004G600A4|5|Great Disney Movie for our collection
B007J4T2G8|5|I was expecting an average-quality book, based off what my friends have told me about it. But \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is an engaging book, exciting and interesting. What I love most about it is the playful dynamic between Christian and Ana. Can't stop reading it!
B006Z7Z3S6|3|***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />This movie has a good concept but a few issues stunted the potential. On the positive notes, a) I really liked the hotel setting, b)the concept of two youngish (Pat Healy is ~40) people having run of an old hotel in its last days for a ghost hunting project is awesome and something I'd love to do, c) acting is decent, and d) while clearly not entirely successful, the movie *tries* to avoid many horror movie cliches.<br /><br />On to the bad...<br /><br />Arguably the biggest problem was the character Luke -- in fact, in a  loathsome way, he's kind of thrust upon us as the real star of the show by virtue of his despicable and unfortunately enduring (not! endearing) personality.  There's technically only 2 key characters, Luke and Claire, and the Luke half is completely unlikeable.  It's clear Luke's character was intended to be snarky and endear little sympathy, but typically, we as an audience are satisfied to see that kind of character either get killed off or redeem himself at the end.  Unfortunately, neither happens with Luke in this film, as he's not only the last man standing of the two key characters, but his unlikeable personality traits endure till the very end.  Early on in the film, most of us were probably calling BS on Luke's account of seeing the ghost, but somehow not able to remember any details, so it was no surprise when later on after running away that he finally admitted to Claire he made it all up.  The guy is a jerk, a coward, and a liar.  And at the end of this movie, we have two people dead, one of which is clearly a suicide and the other clearly...? Ok, we are first led to believe Claire died purely as a result of being pursued by the corpse of the dead man and the ghost of Madeline.  Personally, I was thinking the police should have started looking at Luke as the primary suspect, because after all, how was he going to explain that ghosts were responsible?  Well, the movie has the answer -- she dropped her asthma inhaler and not having that to prevent an attack is what did her in.  That was pretty weak.<br /><br />Another issue is that the movie was good at staying just interesting enough to keep me tagging along in hopes of being rewarded with some great scare scenes and finding out what the real story behind the supposed ghosts are, however, the movie ultimately drags things out too long for a disappointing payoff.  And for all that time spent with very little happening, we never get to understand what the deal is with the 3 spirits that are supposed to be there and why the ghost of Madeline, and eventually the corpse of the old man, were malevolent toward Claire.  Was it due to anger and bitterness held over from the trauma and heartbreak from when they were alive?  Was it because the other spirits, who have no backstory, were evil and either forcing the other spirits to carry out bad deeds or perhaps masquerading as those otherwise benign entities?  We never find out and these aren't the kind of \\"good\\" questions to have at the end of a movie.  Don't get me wrong though, most of my favorite horror movies are of the \\"less is more\\" type and a slow build-up is great -- when done well.<br /><br />And then there was the mother and her son staying at the hotel briefly.  What was their purpose in the context of this film?  Did they need one?  The answer is no, but I would have liked the inclusion of these characters to have been utilized in a way that had some kind of impact on the major plot of the story.  For example, they could have either been focused on in a way as to be a red herring in the plot development of what was going on in the house (and they were not), or, the movie could have found a way to circle back to them toward the end, showing them as more key to the story then we were led to originally believe (and this did not happen).<br /><br />I think there's a good reason that this movie has no better than a 3-star average in the reviews here and that's where my rating is being placed as well.  Despite the issues I found with the movie and my \\"I would have done it this way\\" comments, I have to circle back to my notes on the positives of this movie as reasons enough to go as high as 3 stars and the fact that, in spite of it all, I'd recommend others give this movie a shot and come to their own conclusions -- I'd love to hear them.
0679805273|5|I just graduated high school and I needed some motivation to continue to have passion for a higher education (college) so I decided to buy this book for myself. This book has done wonders for me and its definitely not just for kids. Dr. Seuss found a way to simply encourage people that they can do the things they set their minds to and even if they fall, they have the strength to get back up. I cherish this book and it's something I'm definitely willing to share with other people :)
B003O86FMW|5|I thought this was one of the best books that I've read this year.  I waited to watch the movie until I finished the book.  The movie didn't do the book justice.  Definitely worth reading.
B007GCY8FS|4|A Wanted Man: A Jack Reacher Novel.  I enjoyed - this is a good story in the Jack Reacher series.
B007JM4CWY|5|This is the best monogram puzzle avaliable
B00AA7O6QC|4|great action movie
B00I29VGMC|5|The words, the story, the characters are so masterfully written its a hard one to put down. I quickly became so attached that I never wanted it to end. Life lessons are learned and values instilled by these beautiful people and their exquisite love & the strength it empowers them with. I feel smarter, stronger and hopeful just for having read their story. It felt so real it's hard to believe this is fiction. I applaud the author and look to immediately read more of her work. What a lovely twist on a sexy and unique love story.
B00MXIV7YU|5|Luv it :)
0345529057|5|I received it earlier than expected! The books were in great condition! It was easy to purchase and no hassle at all! Everything was perfect!!
