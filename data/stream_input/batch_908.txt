0547258305|3.0|... from this book. I love fantasy books like Terry Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series, but this one didn't satisfy me. The only thing I really liked was the romance between Po and Katsa, but that's about it. The plot doesn't really develop and the villains (the 2 kings) ... umm ... they sucked! As for the characters, they weren't as memorable as they should be.    In all, this book lacks ... depth.    For those who want light fantasy reading, read this book. But for those who don't, go and read Terry Goodkind's \\"Sword of Truth\\" series instead.
045122499X|3.0|[...]<br /><br />As someone who reads medieval era historical novels almost constantly, I had a very hard time seeing this novel and Follett's earlier as someone new to the genre might. There were lots of little distractions, like anachronistic names and details, but I decided my own position of laissez-faire about such things in other people's books should kick in. So other than this undoubtedly unworthy preface, I am not going to get into this issue.<br /><br />As Pillars of the Earth was about the building of the great cathedral at the fictional town of Kingsbridge, this sequel is about its later maintenance and rebuilding and a great deal more. Descendants of characters in the earlier novel are central to this one. In fact they are almost identical to them. That was the oddest thing about this book. Pillars had Jack Builder, the stonemason, who rocked his era with his vision and innovation. World has Merthen Bridger, a carpenter turned architect who does precisely the same thing... and is his descendant. Jack had a lady love, Aline, who defied convention, became a savvy business woman, and Merthen has Caris, who defies convention and revolutionizes the cloth trade in Kingsbridge too. Jack had his incompetent brother Alfred who undermines his plans for the cathedral and other building jobs in order to land them for himself and then does such a bad job the buildings collapse. Merthen has his master Atheric who does precisely the same thing. Finally, Pillars of the Earth's voyeuristic sexual predator nobleman has his own doppelganger in World Without End, Merthen's brother Ralph. Two hundred year's later to boot. If every single person who reads these books doesn't notice and comment on this, then they are, in my humble opinion, letting Follett's star power influence them. It struck me as nothing less than inept authorship and editing.<br /><br />That is not to say I did not enjoy this book. My praise goes to Follett's handling of the Great Plagues of 1348-50 and its re-appearance in the early 1360s. It's spread in a time when news traveled as slowly as the means of transport the developing awareness of the threat is well drawn. It's impact not only on mortality but on social development, the psyches of the people, on religion and on commerce is wonderfully dealt with. The book's central theme is how stick in the mud concepts and practices had to give way in some part to economics and medical observation. The main female character, Caris, is a scientific observer of illness and figures out the basics of contagion, thus helping lessen the spread of the plague, though opposed by medical traditionalists all the way. The decimation of the population and the resulting labor shortage rocks the feudal system. The Church's clinging to old learning and support of the feudal system in the face of common sense weakens people's willingness to slavish devotion to the rule of the institution of the Church in general. Follett skillfully demonstrates these changes in the lives of the characters of the book who come from all social classes of the time.<br /><br />It is a long, long book with such an involved plot I hesitate to try to summarize it. The opening sequence introduces all the main characters. Four children playing in the woods see a knight chased and attacked by men wearing the livery of Queen Isabella, the recent widow of and possible killer of her royal husband, Edward II. Thomas, the man being attacked, has a secret that others are trying to kill him for. Merthen is the boy he trusts with where he buries the letter he is carrying. Merthen's brother Ralph shows his sociopathic colors early by killing Gwenda's dog, Gwenda being a peasant firl that Kerris befriends. Kerris herself h as fascinated Merthen by being brave, bright and independent, though a girl. Merthem by the way, is carrying a bow he designed and built himself. There you have it.. the whole story. Caris's Independence and courage as she fights corruption in the cityand priory, Fwenda's dependence on those with influence to help her survive, Ralph whose cruelty makes him mess up everyone else's lives, and Merthen, the clever innovator whose honesty makes him vulnerable to the unscrupulous.<br /><br />I found the writing repetitive. I understand how that could happen now that I have a novel of my own out. You honestly forget what you told the reader. But I don't think that's what happened here. Ken Follett has editors who should catch this. I had to catch my own gaffes. In so many places Follett seems to feel he needs to remind you what someone looked like or what happened to them in the past.. for the fourth or twentieth time. I also felt he unnecessarily explained a character's actions after having illustrated them quite well already.<br /><br />The one sequence I have to take issue with is Kerris's journey to find the bishop in France during Edward III's campaign that culminated in the Battle of Cr&eacute;cy. I think the two unescorted nuns would never have made such a journey for such a weak reason -- the prior had stolen money from the convent -- but I also j ust found the introduction of the famous battle into this story irrelevant. It's like Follett just couldn't resist adding a battle scene even though it had little impact on the rest of the story.<br /><br />The other thing that bugged me was how repeatedly in this novel crises built to a fever pitch and were then just shrugged off. It was like \\"Oh my god, we're ruined! We're ruined!\\" was followed by \\"Well, it's a month or two later and we found a way around it.\\" It almost felt like a manipulative cliffganger style serial.<br /><br />So, I recommend you read this novel for the sheer enjoyment but don't believe a word of it, don't be surprised if you have a strong sense of literary d&eacute;ja vu, and get ready to make your own scorecard of whose kids is whose. You'll need it.<br /><br />I read this book as a text file on my Kindle2.

B001DMJ9R4|5.0|DVD is amazing! These guys put on a great show with awesome lighting and pyrotechnics. Just watch it, you'll love it, trust me!  CD is a lot better than expected as well. How some of these songs weren't considered worthy enough for their other cd's suprises me. All have that distict A7X sound with some great guitar solos as always. The only two I can skip through are the two remakes, \\"Walk\\" by Pantera and \\"Flash of the Blade\\" by Iron Maiden. \\"Walk\\" is a great song, just too overplayed by all bands. A7X does do a great job on it though. \\"Flash of the Blade\\" just sounds a little corny for them to be doing, lyrics talking about swords and dragons............  All in all, an absolutely great purchase. I would have paid twice this amount for the DVD alone. Buy it!
B0000CH82P|2.0|Long story short, everything works fine with the mouse. But pressing the middle button is much easier from the part of the wheel close to the center than the other. When I need to scroll up the result is that sometimes I mistakenly end up pressing the central button. Since I use a UNIX machine, this means I end up pasting the text in the clipboard in random places, sometimes not even noticing it. It has become annoying. I have never had a similar problem with any other mouse. Sorry Lenovo, but you need to fix this.  I got this mouse at work, so I cannot tell from the technical details if it is exactly the same model (I wished there was something like the ISBN for books, but there is not). Although from the picture I can tell that it looks exactly the same.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has done it again...and this may very well be his finest work.  I went to the 9:30 a.m. premiere of \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" this morning and I have nothing to say other than QT is a genius in filmmaking.  Brad Pitt, Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent (among many others) turn in academy-consideration performances in this complete twist on war films.  Christoph Waltz better receive an academy nomination for his role as Col. Hans Landa...just superb. I don't want to give away a thing, so all I can say is that if you are a Tarantino fan, this one won't disappoint you.  He has mastered such films as \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", \\"Pulp Fiction\\", \\"Jackie Brown\\", \\"Kill Bill\\" (both movies), \\"Death Proof\\", \\"True Romance\\", \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", and \\"Curdled\\".  He wrote and directed \\"Inglorious Basterds\\".  A solid 10...no hesitation.  The master of revenge has outdone himself.  Long live the king!
B00005OWEG|1.0|I thought Apocalypse Now was a must-see film and the words on the box made this version sound like it was an ever greater masterpiece than the original, so I gave it a try.  It will be my one-and-only, but boy-do-I-regret-having-done-it Apocalypse Now experience.  I should have known better.  Masterpiece is critic code for bizarre, misogynistic, and so strewn with filthy language your grandmother's ghost will haunt you for weeks.  Extended version is code for the stuff we couldn't put in the original because the mens in suits realized audiences wouldn't like it. This kind of movie is for the fans who like both David Lynch and Showgirls.  I regret having seen those too.
B00199B2Z8|2.0|This book is an entertaining read, but the \\"Text to Speech\\" feature on my Kindle2 won't work with this book -- presumably due to the publisher wishing to sell an audio-book for an additional fee.  Be careful of DRM infected eBooks!
0805047905|5.0|I bought this book, Runaway Bunny and Baby's First Mother Goose for my first grandchild.  All are classics and should be in every child's library.  Brown Bear teaches animals and colors, and is so easy to \\"read\\", our children were \\"reading\\" it themselves at age 2.  It also has a tune that goes with it, though, unfortunately, it is not included in the board book.  All of Eric Carle's books are great, but, in my opinion, this one is the best.
B001V9LRV0|5.0|Although I was too young to attend Woodstock, I was well aware of it back in 1969.  My older brother and some of his friends tried to go, but alas didn't make it either.  I remember it for the music and for the spirit of the younger generation.  The drugs was an unfortunate aspect of that era, and as a testament to that both Hendrix and Janis Jopin were dead only a year later as a result of drug and alcohol abuse.  The movie, the extra selections, and the extras in the box gives a really nice, next to being there, feeling.  As one reviewer commented, the video in lots of places is really dark.  It is a combination of the \\"wide movie screen\\" that leaves the top and bottom black, and much of the footage was taken after night.  In addition, the double screen effect also made it look a little darker.  But, in all, a great experience to watch.  The extra performances is what really made it for me.  I highly recommend it if you want to at least feel like \\"You're going back to the Garden\\".
0452295548|3.0|I was disappointed in the beginning of this book. I felt there was a lot of redundancy and verbosity in the description of her actual stroke (and I wonder how she could possibly remember such minute detail). There was also a lack of clear explanation at times- she would mention a certain therapy that worked for her but leave out any description of it and how it helped. I was hoping to hear more about the recovery process itself. I did, however, find the final chapters very interesting. She may be beginning to identify something about the way the brain works in terms of controlling one's feelings. How often would someone have the chance to study their own response after a stroke?! I feel it's worth reading just to contemplate her thoughts on how one might become more at peace with oneself by trying to teach certain parts of the brain to take a rest.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I loved loved loved this book!  Definately my new fav from Sophie.

I hope they make this one into a movie for sure.  I would be first in line!
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I recently just watched the original star wars trilogy, unaltered, as they first appeared in theaters, in high def. on spike tv.  I don't understand why that oaf lucas can't just throw the exact same thing onto some blu-ray discs to satisfy millions, maybe billions of people.     On a side note, I've always thought that Lucas is a talentless clown and the movies were supposed to be terrible.  And they would have been, if it weren't for the accidental genius of john williams, harrison ford, james earl jones etc.      The real Lucas can be seen in episode I, which is the crapfest that he originally dreamt up.
0451528956|5.0|Most readers may be surprised at just how coy and evasive this short novel is.  We get only fleeting images of the villain and his transgressions.  For a work that has become so well knit into our cultural standards and mores, it's perhaps remarkable how little actually goes on.<br /><br />You think you know the story.  But what most people actually know is the 1936 movie starring Frederic March.  Who Hyde is, his relationship to Jekyll, even how one becomes the other: all of these have been changed in every movie, TV, stage, and comic book adaptation ever made.<br /><br />For what's reputedly a horror novel, this book is remarkably unscary.  Maybe in 1886, when its ideas were new, it was terrifying.  But now, when its core idea has become part of our culture, it's more thought-provoking than frightening.  As Stevenson hints at dribs and drabs of Freudian, Darwinian, post-colonial, and other ideas that have become common coin, remember that he wrote before any of these were popular notions.<br /><br />Start right in on the novel.  Vladimir Nabokov's introductory essay states a lot that is obvious, and should be read only after the novel itself.  On balance, Dan Chaon's afterword, about the novel's cultural impact, is probably more revelatory, and more accessible to general audiences.<br /><br />Remember, this book is probably not what you think you know.  It's at once more ambitious, yet far harder to pin down, than the cheapened versions in the mass media.  It's smart yet understandable, familiar yet strange.  It's the kind of book too few writers create these days.
B00004U2G1|2.0|Don't waste your money on this SACD! It's basically a CD in disguise. I love Boston though!
B000000WHC|5.0|I love this CD.  Never get tired of playing it's tracks. Gary Moore is one of the world's best guitarists.
B000005L86|5.0|In my opinion the best reggae album I have ever heard. From the first listen of the original vinyl I was hooked. I played it over and over again for days. It was all I wanted to hear. The vibe of this album is just fantastic! Totally up. My personal favs are \\"Fisherman\\", \\"Children Crying\\", \\"La La Bam-Bam\\", \\"Ark Of The Covenant\\" and of course the otherworldy, transcendant power of \\"Open Up The Gate\\".     Now, initially I was a bit put off by the sub-par sound quality of the original release vinyl. The opening track, \\"Fisherman\\" has very noticable drop-outs and the album as a whole has various problems with eq and tape hiss. I attempted remastering the album myself a few times but I was never quite happy with the results. The dropouts in \\"Fisherman\\" especially bothered me. Luckily, the album was professionaly remastered and re-released on cd as the \\"Blood & Fire\\" edition. Included in this edition is a thick booklet which has a detailed explaination of the limitations of the original master tapes (which were quarter inch, recorded on a Teac 4-track!). Apparently the tapes were not very well preserved. Although the mastering engineers used all the latest technology to try to eliminate tape hiss and drop-outs, in the end they still couldn't make it perfect. Most of the tape hiss was generated by Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's practice of bouncing tracks (mixing multiple instruments together on one track to free up the other tracks; a necessity if you are recording on a 4-track machine) and they opted to allow some tape hiss in order to preserve the original fidelity of the recording. They also claim that they couldn't do anything about the dropouts in \\"Fisherman\\" but from my estimation they cleaned them up rather well. The dropouts of hardly noticable at all on the remastered cd. The frequency spectrum has a much better balance as well.     I highly recommend the remastered Blood & Fire edition! The versions of most of the songs are longer and it includes some songs not featured on the original release, plus a bonus disc of 12\\" remixes and b-sides. Although the sound quality isn't perfect, (compared to other Jamaican reggae recordings from this era, or earlier; like Bob Marley's original tracks for \\"Catch A Fire\\" or Mighty Diamonds \\"Right Time\\") the inventiveness of the Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's production style and the songwriting and performances are all incredible. Also knowing that the remastered version is as good as it can get makes it easier to accept the slight flaws in production and/or engineering.      All in all it's hard to say exactly what it is that makes this album so enjoyable. It's as if everything just came together; the songs, the music, the vocals, the effects, the vibe...a perfect moment in time. In my opinion, you would be very hard pressed to find a better reggae album than this. It is sheer bliss!
B00278U1WA|4.0|I have and love all of her previous work, and at the first few listenings of 'Far' I was a bit disappointed in it's more commercial feel.  But these tunes quickly became infectious, and darned if I didn't start humming them in the shower anyway!  Thanks for your music Regina. Your next album can't come soon enough!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|What an amazing series and without commericals this is definitely the way to go.  This series was cast really well, great script, scenery, costumes, make up etc.  Truly worth the money for a week's entertainment.

B002CAWNEM|1.0|I saw this movie and in order to save myself a lot of time it would take to type all off the bad things about this movie. Read and listen to the reviews of the people that did take the time to type all of the bad things about this movie.
B002IKLZZY|1.0|It's not the fact that they allow reviews to be published before a review is even out. That annoys me. It's not that they sometimes don't put aspect ratios up or put the wrong aspect ratios up. That annoys me. What REALLY annoys me is that they take reviews from other previously released discs, in this instance old DVDs of North by Northwest, and link them to a new disc like this (which isn't even out as I type this), the WBs 50th anniversary North by Northwest DVD. I guess the braniacs at Amazon.com and Amazon.UK don't think that anyone cares about the disc itself. Anyway, this is why I am giving Amazon 1 star. I would give them a 0 if they allowed me to. A pox...
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I never had the pleasure of seeing Michael Jackson in concert while he was alive, and I was so brokenhearted when he died. I never thought that I would be able to experience the excitement that he brought to everyone at one of his concerts! That is until I received my copy of his concert \\"Live in Bucharest\\". I can't tell you how excited I was to see him in action on stage! Believe me I was not dissapointed, it was the next best thing to being there live! I especially enjoyed watching the reaction of the people screaming, and fainting at his every move. There will never be another entertainer that can capture the hearts, and the emotions that Michael did! This was one of the best investments I have ever made, and I'll have it forever! I can watch it over and over whenever I feel the need to! By the way the quality is excellent, I highly recommend this DVD!!  Long Live Michael Jackson, the King of Pop!  Thank you for the memories!  Joe Salas in Dallas!
B001SN78JO|3.0|This movie is based on the real life experience of a British comic named Danny Wallace who spent a year saying \\"yes\\" to everything for better or for worse...or for stranger.  In the film, Jim Carrey plays an emotionally closed down man who has fallen into the habit of saying no to everything, until he's convinced by a cheesy self-help guru to make a \\"covenant\\" with life to say yes to everything.<br /><br />One might expect the movie to be something really zany given Jim Carrey's typical brand of humor (which I felt smothered the humor in a similar film he was in years back called \\"Liar, Liar), but for the most part I thought it was a little more serious than that...to the point where when it did veer into craziness, that seemed a bit out of place and contrived.  I finished watching this thinking that it might have been interesting if the story had played it completely straight and shown both the good and the bad resulting from living one's life as a \\"yes man.\\"  That's because I discovered about five years ago when I watched Carrey give the best performance of his career in \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" he can do \\"serious\\" leavened with a touch of humor as well as if not better than his manic shtick.<br /><br />The best scenes in the movie are those with Carrey and his co-star, Zooey Deschanel.  She plays a much more likable character here than the enigmatic Summer Finn in the more recent \\"500 Days of Summer.\\"  Despite the fact that Jim Carrey is about 15 years older than her, I could believe them as a couple and more to the point I liked them as a couple.<br /><br />So my verdict on \\"Yes Man\\" is a guarded \\"maybe.\\"

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|What can I say about Inglourious Basterds? Unique, inventive, smart writing and excellent acting throughout are what first comes to mind when thinking about the film I just got back from seeing. Be warned, there is a lot of talking (the first scene is a 20 minute conversation), even for a Tarantino flick, but the dialogue is excellent and the characters are memorable. The only negative is that some scenes do drag just a little, but not enough to bore the life out of you. There are also some well crafted action scenes that are brutal, though they played a much more minor role than I expected.<br /><br />Brad Pitt turns in a fine performance and provides most of the comedic moments. Just don't expect him to be on the screen all the time. Unlike what you see in the trailers, he and his \\"Basterds\\" play supporting roles. There is no real leading role here, but one does take a commanding presence over all the rest. New to many people who will be watching this movie, Christoph Waltz delivers a performance to remember and will at minimum get nominated for an Oscar. He is clever, charming, slimy, unpredictable and evil. Expertly acted evil dudes seem to be cleaning up the supporting actor categories every year now. Javier Bardem won it for No Country for Old Men in 2007 and the late Heath Ledger did the same for the The Dark Knight in 2008. Why break tradition this year, especially given the complexity of Waltz's acting here. He already won the Cannes Film Festival Best Actor award. The two main female actresses, Melanie Laurent (nomination worthy) and Diane Kruger, were both captivating and added the right elements this film needed. In fact, every person on screen seemed right for the role they were given. Well, horror director and buddy of Tarantino, Eli Roth, was a little off at times, but thankfully he has a smaller role and lets his baseball bat do most of the talking for him.<br /><br />Don't expect any historical accuracy, just get ready for a wild fantasy WWII movie that only Tarantino can pull off. His signature music and song selection was also some of his best. One thing is for sure, Quentin Tarantino is back on top in a BIG way.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 starsntino can pull off.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|The Fourth season of Supernatural, was the best season yet. We saw Dean return from death. And Sam has powers, other than the psychic thing. The Halloween episode was funny, the episode where Dean thinks he's haunted is just too perfect. I love the chemistry the main characters have, you actually believe they're brothers. Like I said before, Season four, was the best yet!

B001PPGAIA|4.0|There's a reason why classics are classics, and that's because they fulfill a basic human thirst for romance, adventure, the fellow getting the girl, and the good guys coming out on top. Nicole Kidman dares to be herself in this film, and turns in her best performance ever. As for Hugh Jackman, he couldn't be more appealing. The bad guys are bad, the good guys persevere, and Australia is the sort of movie they don't make anymore, but should. Great entertainment.

0143038419|4.0|I was a little surprised as I read some of the reviewers complaints about the author being whiney and self-involved.  It seems like the sub-title, would indicate to anyone that this is a book about a personal journey, and the nature of the subject would kind of suggest that yes, the story is going to be about her, thoughts, her feelings, her viewpoints, just HER.  She can only start the journey from where she began, and talk about it from her perspective, and she IS a middle class white American woman.  Complaining about that is like reading an autobiography and then complaining that the author only wanted to talk about herself.    That said, I enjoyed just about all of the book, I thought the parts in Italy and India were compelling, and they both made me ache to travel. It seems like the book kind of falls apart in Indonesia, though.  The writing in the first two locations is vibrant and involved. In Italy the focus is very external, as she talks about her search for pleasure, there is a lot of description of what she's doing and who she's with and what she's eating (and I love food writing).  In India, she is clearly on a spiritual journey, and she conveys the difficulty of this quest in an interesting way that doesn't feel preachy or off-putting to me.  Much of this part of the book is internal, but it's still interesting to read about her particular experiences.  When she gets to Indonesia, it's like she's run out of the energy to tell this story, and it begins to fall flat.  It's still pretty interesting, but it just doesn't match the first two sections of the book. Also, I felt like she was holding something back about the relationship with Wayan. And so I only give it four stars.      I do wonder how much she got for an advance on this book.  There's no sense of concern for her financial circumstances conveyed in what she's writing, but she makes it pretty clear that she's not rich during the course of her journey.  But two of the three places she went are pretty inexpensive to live in, and you can probably do Rome fairly inexpensively if you're careful, so I don't think this journey is outrageously out of reach of the average person, provided they saved for a while, and were frugal during the trip, and were ok with having nothing when they returned.  And that last one, I think, is what stops so many of us from starting out.  So I say kudos to Elizabeth Gilbert for taking those first steps out the door, and for giving us a memorable account of her journey.

B00005JOHC|3.0|Charlie Sheen is a very good actor.  I enjoyed him in movies, especially in PLATOON and WALL STREET. He thereafter made a lot of duds in film and then, following in his father's footsteps, he turned to being a star in a tv series. I can't say that he does a bad job on this series.  For what it is, he delivers.  I guess where I have a problem is that this series is such a throwback to the past and not in a good way.  If MAD MEN makes us look back at ourselves during sexist times we'd rather forget now, this series brings those days into the here and now.  Worse, it seems to revel in them. I suppose it also reminds me of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson movies where Rock chases women and evades women like Day only to be bagged by Day in the end.  Charlie could be a present day version of the Rock character but he never meets Doris.  He just keeps going and going in his usual women chasing ways, never to be bagged. The twist offered here is a nephew and a brother to provide the counter balance of family and tradition.  Charlie is stuck with them and their more middle class values in the wake of his brother's divorce.  I made it half way through this DVD series and gave up. This series might be for someone else but it's not for me.  I just don't care about Charlie, his life or his problems and that is fatal for enjoying this series.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00011KHTM|1.0|Title says it all. Observed that the monitor had a yellow and then a cyan cast. Wiggling the cable lightly would fix it temporarily, but a loud sneeze would ruin it. I noticed that others have had the same problem. I bought mine thru Amazon from Setec (CEcompass), and they promise an exchange within a year after purchase. Haven't heard yet from them, but I'm hoping for the best. This is the first Apple product I've not rated highly.<br /><br />Update Aug 26,2009 : CEcompass promptly sent me a replacement cable when I emailed them and told them about the problem. This seems like a reliable source for these cables.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|This movie is being compared to SOPHIE'S CHOICE, written by the wonderful William Styron. The reasons for comparison are that this is another Holocaust story, of someone who is responsible for others' deaths in the Holocaust.  Sophy was played by the young Meryl Streep whereas this female lead is played by Kate Winslet, who is an acting powerhouse who can be compared to Streep.  Finally, in both stories there was also a love aspect to and because of the lead's culpability in atrocity, that love story cannot be fully realized.<br /><br />The problem is that SOPHIE'S CHOICE was an electrifying movie which engaged the viewer on every level. Sophie was deeply tragic and your heart was broken by the end of the movie for her and the mentally deranged Nathan.  But this movie is hardly electrifying.  It seems almost academic in comparison, the way it plods along.<br /><br />The premise is this: Hanna (Kate Winslet) has an affair with a young man and the part she likes best about their affair is when he reads to her, no matter what it is he reads.  They part and much, much later, she is tried as a war criminal for following orders which resulted in many people's deaths in the Holocaust.  As a \\"good German,\\" she went along with the Nazi party line and frankly does not see that she had any other choice.  Her lover is now a grown, middle aged German man himself (Fiennes) and he watches her trial and is torn by conflicting emotions.  He cannot doubt her complicity because it comes out in the trial that she liked prisoners to read to her, just like he read to her.  This compounds his horror at what she has done.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is capable of being every bit as electrifying as Kevin Kline was in SOPHIE'S CHOICE.  For some reason though, it never happens.  Since we have two powerhouse actors here that never catch fire, I can only assume it is the writing and the directing which are the problem.<br /><br />Let me also add that in 2009, this is well covered literary material.  I am sure there will always be someone somewhere who writes something of great merit of the events which took place during WWII.  However, so much has been written by this point, and so much of it is FABULOUS, that any writer who tackles this thematically is taking on a path well trod.  If you can't bring something fresh and electric to this type of material, it might be better to pick a subject matter which hasn't already been covered by so many masters in all media formats.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00006ZXSK|5.0|A beautiful and charming film with exquisite production and fine acting.  George Fenton's excellent score enhances this film.  The 2.35:1 DVD is enhanced for 16:9 TVs.  The picture and sound are excellent.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|Wes Craven steps aside as director, but stands in as executive producer, the new director knows just what hot buttons to push for the storyline. Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter play the parents of one of the girls-who take a vicious revenge against the rapists/killers. This was good, but you won't want to watch this before going on a family trip. This time around-there's a little more backstory behind the criminals, which was a nice touch.  This is a greatly modernized version of the original, some will like it, others maybe offended, but either way, this re-make is definitely Not for the weak-hearted. I myself own it, and have only got through it once, oh well.
0061767581|5.0|A very good book.. Can't wait till the next one comes out! Leaves you wanting to read more!!!
0385341008|5.0|I waited to buy this book for ages (not really sure why). By the time I actually bought it there was alot of pressure on it to be really good. I'm happy to say that it did not disappoint. The story is written in the form of letters from a delightful group of literary society members - very down to earth, believable characters. I found the story easy to follow and very enjoyable.<br /><br />This for me was another of those books that once you started it you just had to keep going - it was very tough to put down.<br /><br />It was very much the 'feel good' book other reviews led me to believe it would be - and it totally transported me to another place and another time.<br /><br />I would recommend it highly.
B000641Z90|3.0|I'm not a huge fan, but the concert was generally enjoyable with a couple of songs being outstanding primarily due to the energy of everyone on stage. Some of the staging, while flamboyant and well-used, looked a bit contrived.     I share the irritation on the audio that others have mentioned. IT does not afflict every song but on a few songs it sounds like a drunk monkey was bouncing around with the levels constantly. It is incredibly annoying. I can't imagine why the producers would release the DVD with that low level of consistent quality.    If you want to see what a top notch music DVD looks and SOUNDS like, see Springsteen in Barcelona. The staging is much simpler with Springsteen but the DVD production values are excellent.
B002HJ61LO|5.0|What a book! Sadly it ended way too quickly. It had an amazingly intertwined, complicated plot with many sub-plots. It was an extremely compelling read. I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />You can read all the plot details in other reviews; I'm here to say that if you're on the fence about reading it -- don't hesitate; it is completely worth your time.<br /><br />I'd also highly recommend the next book in the series, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\".<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!
0307269981|5.0|Well book one in this series was great, so I just had to read book two. This one is equally as suspensefull, thrilling and well written as the first one. I am almost finished with it and will be eagerly awaiting book #3 (sadly the last in the series).<br /><br />If you like mystery, intrigue, suspense, lots of characters and a solid multi-layered plot - then this book and this series are for you.<br /><br />You do not need to have read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo before reading this book, but it is helpful as this story continues where that book left off.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|I've discovered in writing reviews that they tend to actually write themselves. Some reviews demand that a synopsis, others to the themes and style of the movie being reviewed. In either case you're trying to give the reader a sense of the movie and whether it's something they want to see or not. Since Pulp Fiction Quentin Tarantino's movies have so intricately weaved that a synopsis would lead to a lengthy review, and in the case of Inglourius Basterds it's best to see the movie and let all the elements reveal themselves.<br /><br />As you've seen on the commercial about Inglourious Basterds, it's about a squad of Jewish American soldiers behind enemy lines led by Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine and their mission is to kill \\"Natzis.\\"  There is more to the plot, it also revolves around a Jewish woman Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) who escapes the clutches of German Col. Landa (Christoph Waltz) who is in charge of German occupied France.<br /><br />Inglourious Basterds reveals the mature artist in Tarantino. The opening scene is confidently filmed letting the characters talk, as we learn just who Col. Landa is, and despite his civilized and cultured demeanor he is a cunning and devious officer committed to carrying out his orders, hunting down Jews. In other parts of the movie when Shosanna comes face to face to with Col. Landa Tarantino lets the camera rest on her and her struggle to remain calm as the Colonel makes small talk with Joseph Goebbels.<br /><br />While all the action takes place in war time France and Germany, this movie may be more about movies than war. The characters are self-consciously aware of movies. Pitt and his band watch a German officer beaten to death with a bat with the stated reason that it's the closest they get to seeing a movie these days. Shosanna is the owner of a movie theatre in Paris and her plan revolves around her knowledge of film. So, is Tarantino just aware of the part movie's played in the lives of people of the war time era? Or is he making a statement that making movies is a war? And a nasty one at that.<br /><br />Tarantino plays with his usual palette of colors violence, humor, crisp dialogue, and music and mixes all of them that create new colors and shocking results that only Tarantino can pull off. There is violence, you will see people scalped, beaten to death, and shot to pieces, but it is war. Tarantino's violence has always seemed stylized to me, not cartoonish, maybe hyper-real is a better to describe it.  The violence looks like it could be real but there is an element that lets you realize the violence is fictional without pulling you out of the movie. And there's Tarantino's dark humor that if were in different circumstances or situations we might not ordinarily laugh at, but Tarantino bends the situation just enough for a dark humor to materialize and that's mostly because of the dialogue Tarantino is noted for. If the movie hadn't had me already, by the time David Bowie's song Cat People (Putting Out The Fire, from the movie Cat People) hit the soundtrack, it would've captured me right there.<br /><br />At the end of the movie Pitt's character comments as Tarantino's surrogate \\"this just may be my masterpiece.\\" I think he just might be right.at making movies is a war?

B002E2QHBS|5.0|We all know that Woodstock was a seminal moment in history.  This box set lays out the events in a full (but not complete) and colorful way.  The booklet that comes with the set is of high quality, with plenty photos of the artists who played at the event.  You can easily tell that there has been some cleaning up of the recordings.  I'm not sure they could have done more with cleaning up the recordings without then comprimising the quality of the songs.  Some of the groups definitely sound better than earlier attempts, while some of the new songs that have been added to this box set are good, but not great (sound recording wise).  I know they wanted to present as many artists as they could, but there are a couple of acts that (imho) they could've left off.  Then they would've had more room to expand out the set lists for some of the other acts.  I'm glad they included Dark Star, more Arlo Guthrie, Country Joe and the Fish, and the Who, as well as the full version of Woodstock Boogie.  I hope the Who decide to put out their complete act in a seperate disc, like the Jefferson Airplane and the others did.

B002F3BP8Q|4.0|The Cult \\"Love\\" is one of my top 10 albums of all time and for that reason I've purchased all the US editions. When I raced home to pop this in the CD player and after the first few notes of \\"Nirvana\\", my ears detected a sonic improvement. This 2 CD set has more bottom end and the highs are crystal clear. Even if you already have \\"Love\\" this is worth picking up for the first disc alone. To my ears it sounds like the 2nd disc has also been remastered and is recommended for those that even were fortunate to obtain the \\"Rare Cult\\" box set. Personally I don't feel that Beggars Banquet is trying to milk this release. CD Technology has improved even in the last few years and for that reason this is a welcome addition.      For fans of Zeppelin and other \\"Classic Rock\\" this is recommended.
B0001CCXY8|3.0|After [[ASIN:B000001CAL Vile]] (weak), [[ASIN:B0006M17D6 Gallery of Suicide]] (decent), [[ASIN:B00001X515 Bloodthirst]] (uninspired) and [[ASIN:B000060OLE Gore Obsessed]] (more of the same), it was finally time for Cannibal Corpse to return with a good album, and this is definitely a good album. To begin with, Vince's artwork was the most inspired in years - a throwback to [[ASIN:B000001C7Z Butchered at Birth]]. Even though it's more fantastical in nature, it's pretty shocking to look at. And then there's the songs themselves, feeling much more inspired than they had been for years. \\"Severed Head Stoning\\" tells of a man stoned to death with the severed heads of his own family members - what a way to start an album! \\"Decency Defied\\" is an absolutely great Jack Owen track, with a method to its steady riffing, directly followed by the impossibly insane \\"Frantic Disembowelment\\", a viciously fast Pat O'Brien guitar nightmare. To this day, the band all agree that it's their most difficult song to learn (regardless of instrument). The title track is a slower one, but it describes the lineage of this wicked creature in nice and rhyming choruses. This is followed by a whole slew of (mostly) steady tracks, closing up with songs like \\"Bent Backwards And Broken\\" (cleverly put) and one of my favourites, an homage to [[ASIN:B000009O8A I Spit on Your Grave]], \\"They Deserve To Die\\" - where rapist scum get their comeuppance both literally and lyrically. The Wretched Spawn is a much more inspired, vicious and diverse album than many of its predecessors, and it's not to be missed.
0307454541|4.0|Good story with interesting characters.  Loved the mystery about Harriet, though I figured it out long before the main character did.  Sorry that the author is deceased but am looking forward to his remaining two books.  Four stars as the plot did drag on a bit too long.
1400079179|1.0|From everything I've heard, the liberties this book takes with documented, verifiable history are astounding, but I never made it to any of those passages. I tried to read this book.  I tried to like it.  But I just couldn't force myself past page 50.<br /><br />A writer for The New York Times called this book \\"Dan Brown's best-selling primer on how not to write an English sentence,\\" and I think that that is a perfectly fitting epithet for this book.  The prose felt adolescent at best, the kind of sentence-to-sentence work I would expect of a young teenager in his first creative writing class, not a professionally written and edited novel.  This is the kind of writing that has no regard for the definition of words being used, the kind of writing that uses \\"literally\\" to mean \\"figuratively.\\"  To be frank, this was the worst writing I've ever seen someone paid to produce in print.<br /><br />Even worse, though, was the fact that the author is asking his readers to have faith and trust in--and is even staking the entirety of the plot on--the intelligence of a main character when he portrays the main character as being, to put it bluntly, far less intelligent and far less informed than you would expect someone with his background to be.  The man sees a naked man lying, arms and legs spread, in the center of a circle; he stares at this image for pages upon interminable pages; at long last he finally gets the vague notion that this image looks familiar.  It's even longer before he finally makes the connection to Leonardo's Vitruvian Man.  This man is supposed to be a hyper-intelligent, insightful, world-class art historian, and it takes him multiple chapters to recognize a blatant allusion to one of the most famous drawings in the world--a drawing referenced in innumerable other works of art since then, a drawing instantly recognizable to anyone who has even seen a Bowflex commercial.<br /><br />In short: It is badly written, and an insult to any reader willing to lend it a modicum of credibility.ity.

0451209338|4.0|\\"The Kill Artist\\" features, Gabriel Allon, one of the world's foremost painting restoration experts.  Allon is also a former Mossad hit man.  He is lured out of retirement when he is presented with the opportunity to eliminate the terrorist that destroyed his family.    This book is an international espionage novel that develops at a measured pace.  The action is not as fast-paced as a Robert Ludlum or a Vince Flynn novel.  However, the brooding, introspective Allon seems to be a much more realistic character than the nearly superhuman Jason Bourne or Mitch Rapp.    I look forward to reading the further exploits of Mr. Allon.

B0015ABRE2|5.0|The first couple of episodes in season 3 have a much different vibe than the previous two -- it's a bit slower (not entirely a bad thing considering what it builds into), deeper and darker in my opinion. It sort of puts Dexter's relationships under a microscope and deals with issues such as the bonds and limits of friendship, fatherhood and the touchings of soon-to-be-married life. But by mid-season you start to realize the possibilities of chaos that now swarm around Dex like swampflies. The tension is high and the subplots are just as great as the main attraction. And it all comes to a very satisfying climax that will have fans craving more -- which is what a good show should do.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what kind of trouble he gets himself into next season. It's always good, bloody fun when it comes to Dexter. This is simply one of the best, if not THE best, shows to grace television.

B002DKF47O|5.0|enough said by everyone else. this is the best behemoth release by far and also my favorite blackened death metal album release ever. it may have taken almost 2 decades to sound this good but it finally happened. not only is the music incredible, but the production is spot on. i still think the bass could have been more audible, but in this case the music is so incredible theres no way i could complain about anything else. matter of fact if you find anything else negative to say about this you really probably dont listen to this type of music.
B001718N96|3.0|The Mysterious Affair At Styles is my first reading of an Agatha Christi book.  I chose this one only because it was her first book and the initial introduction of Hercule Poirot. If I had to choose again, I would probably not choose this book as my first introduction to her, because her later works presented a much more refined and talented form of writing.      This work, despite its presentation flaws, did establish Poirot as a detective to be admired and respected for his talents.  It was for this reason that I never figured out why he would be associated with a character like Arthur Hastings, who appeared, in this book at least, to be little more than a stupid, ridiculous person, a dummy, and an idiot with an IQ that would barely match the low end of normal.  I ended the book with the distinct hope that Ms. Christi would kill that character off.    One of the other things I found difficult with this work was that it presented too many clues and overwhelmed the reader with so much information that it was difficult to follow some of it.  Even so, I found that I was pretty close to the correct solution in the end, though not completely dead on and not for the right reason.  Maybe my intuition was working.    Since I am reviewing the Kindle edition of this book, I should take the time to point out that the conversion to digital format was very well done.  There were no misspelled words or words that were run together.  The one thing that was missing, however, were the sketches or pictures that were referenced in the story.  While an annoyance, this was not a big problem as they were not really necessary to understanding what was happening.      All of that said, I feel no particular need to review the story line itself, because I don't want to take away the pleasure of reading the book for yourself.  Suffice it to say that the murder is done, the clues are presented, the possible suspects are many, and poirot gets his killer.  It is for you now to see if you can solve the case along with him.  While you are doing that, I will see if I can find another of Ms. Christi's works to enjoy.
1563899426|1.0|If you love the deep story telling of Watchmen or Sandman... do not buy this book.    In one word you could define this book as `cliche`    There was no depth to the characters... I kept stepping over the characters dialogue as I the predictable storyline had already played out in my head.    While the storyline was not written for adults it contained a lot of adult themes.  If they would have toned down the sex and violence it would be an excellent graphic for kids.    I highly recommend Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Sandman, and Transmetropolitan.

I loved to read \\"Warrior's Apprentice\\" by Bujold and found similar thing what would be interesting. Assassin's Apprentice was free kindle book, so I just choose. I am glad that I did read first one.     At first fime, Fitz was younger than me. I thought he's too naive to live in the world. Well, He did well. At that time, I didn't like the Fool. He was annoying, always talking nonsenses. also he looks like love Fitz, and I didn't understand. Like, We could be good friends, but why you ruin my friendship? Fitz felt betrayed by his love at that time.     But now, I totally fall in love with my Fool. He should be loved by Fitz. I wanted, hopelessly, Fitz leave Molly with the Queen and Prince's care. So The Fool and The Bastard could begin new journey and make good relationship. don't need to be like lovers, but like     It's not a romance, but have romantic factors. When Jinna told Fitz that his old love will come back, I thought that's Fool. I really hoped. Well, it wasn't.    I read Fool series for last 4 days. I couldn't sleep well, I couldn't eat well. I just couldn't stop to read. I was hungry, sleepy, hard to focus, but I can't leave my Fool. I annoyed with Fitz when he forgot about the Fool while Dragon's fighting. I couldn't see through long sequince. I want to know about Fool. Elliana and Pietor? should brought the Fool! I want to know about the Fool... and when I heard his dead, I didn't beileve. I would not.     I'm glad that he's back. I'm sad that he must leave again. I guess when Molly die, The Fool will come back. I hope.
B001152TL6|1.0|Sometimes you wonder why people put money, time and talent into a piece of garbage like this. If they had only given me the funds that were wasted on this movie, I would have invested it and made millions.<br />Neo-Noir? I'd spell it C-R-A-P. The script flew out of the car, onto the highway and wasn't numbered. So they just stapled it all together without checking with anyone and you got this.<br /><br />It was like watching a Charlie Sheen look-alike acting badly. At 82 minutes into the movie (a miracle I go that far into it) I was contemplating pulling out the DVD and using it for target practice at the range. Robert Loggia played his oft-repeated tough-guy mobster role, Gary Busey in his pre-druggie days, and Patricia Arquette as the spaced-out, airhead girlfriend of Mr. Eddy (Loggia) who likes \\"doing it\\" with the Charlie Sheen guy (I forgot and don't care what his name was). Robert Blake played a hideous little imp with flour makeup.<br /><br />I truly believe these type movies are made for when you are either drunk or stoned; or both. At 107 minutes you'll either be laughing out loud or screaming for the director's head. I'd be like Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder, and have the Key Grip punch out the Director and then I'd improvise and have the rest of the crew punch out the writer(s). Oh yeah, Bill Pullman wasn't very convincing as the spaced-out screeching sax player earlier in this tripe. You know what? Everyone involved in this movie was spaced-out.<br /><br />What do you do with garbage? You throw it out. Do the same with this movie.
1416955070|1.0|A friend recommended this to me after I had mentioned that I liked Libba Bray's wonderful Gemma Doyle trilogy.  I don't know what she was thinking, as Clare's writing is amateurish compared to Bray's...well compared to anyone, actually.  I have no idea how this book got published.      After trudging through 150 pages of overwrought descriptions and literally pages and pages of exposition/world building thinly veiled in dialogue (who the hell asks about magical systems after waking up from being poisoned, knowing that your mother has just been kidnapped?  Who?) I just gave up.  The writing, pacing, and characters were all atrocious.  Everyone sauntered, sneered, and generally tried too hard to set each other up for one liners.  I don't read much YA, but I read enough to know that the looming gaps in logic in this book are attributable to the author's lack of skills, rather than the genre she's working in.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Over ten years in the making, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS hits the big screen with all sorts of hype.  This film received a 16 minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival.  Actor Chris Waltz won a Best Actor award at that festival too.  Plus Director Tarantino himself considers this his magnum opus.  PULP FICTION is my all-time favorite movie, so needless to say I had all sorts of lofty expectations heading into this one.<br /><br />The title was inspired by the '78 cult classic, but this is by no means a remake.  Quentin describes this as \\"a spaghetti western with WWII iconography\\".  It takes place shortly after D-Day.<br /><br />\\"We're in the business of killing Nazis.  And business is good.\\"  Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) leads a roughneck group of American-Jewish soldiers hellbent on striking fear in the hearts of the German soldiers trespassing on French soil.<br />There also is another story that runs parallel with this premise--A young Jewish woman named Shosanna seeks revenge against the Nazis after her family was slaughtered.<br /><br />Tarantino's stamp is all over this one.  It is indeed a genre-blending thrill ride with scenes of graphic violence, but surprisingly the brutality is actually toned down.  It has obscure refences to things/people in film that QT loves, some of which I'm sure I didn't catch.  There are lots of idioms in pop culture, and for once Tarantino fits them all in nicely without feeling forced.<br />_____________________________________________________________<br /><br />Now, there is alot to love about this movie, but I am going to be a bit critical.  Seriously, that's a shock coming from me, I pretty much worship every film Tarantino has ever done.  Here is what I didn't completely love about I.B.<br /><br />1. PACING<br />I have never been even slightly bored during any of Q's previous work.  That includes DEATH PROOF, which many people considered it \\"too talky\\".  This film has quite a bit of dialogue, so take that into consideration.  Plus the two story lines get a little convoluted.  I would have loved for this movie to concentrate solely on the Basterd's and had more Nazi scalping scenes.<br /><br />2. SAMUEL JACKSON<br />I love Sammy J immensely, but didn't feel his narration was necessary.<br /><br />3. MIKE MYERS<br />He actually can act, but I couldn't help but see Austin Powers/Dr. Evil when he was on screen.<br /><br />4. STORYBOARDS<br />His use of throwing up the CHAPTER board introductions was not needed.  It actually prevents you from getting immersed in the story.<br /><br />5. CHARACTERS<br />None of the characters were developed as much as I would have liked either, largely because of the broad story.  I loved Eli Roth's role as THE BEAR JEW, but he didn't see enough screen time.  Neither did the amazing Waltz as THE JEW HUNTER, nor Pitt as Aldo.<br /><br />I don't mean to sound too critical of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.  I really did enjoy it.  It actually is a poignant tale of guilt, morality, hatred, evil, and revenge.  It might just be Tarantino's most critically acclaimed movie ever.  Still, this is his first movie that didn't totally leave me stunned when I left the theater.I would have loved for this movie to concentrate solely on the Basterd's and had more Nazi scalping scenes.    2.

B0021L8UPI|5.0|In this age of computer graphics and special effects came this little gem, which needed not rely on either. As well, it is only right that I mention that for a horror thriller, the performances were fantastic. The plot keeps the audience interested throughout the film.  There are similarities between this and a few other films. The Good Son starring Macaulay Culkin at first came to mind.  From the atmosphere all the way through to the plot...this movie truly delivers!  I have viewed this film twice at the theatre and it was just as good the second time around as it was for the first.  The young actors in this film are as good as the adults and it's the acting that brings this film out of pure mediocrity!  The Orphan is a welcome edition to the horror/thriller genre and is not a film that you are likely to forget once you see it!  Compared to many of the horrible horror films that make it to theatrical release...this film was worthy of being released theatrically!  The film's character is more sadistic than 'The Good Son' and more evil than 'The Bad Seed.'  This is not Damien from The Omen series...but Esther can hold her own in the world of evil movie children.  Sure, there have been many, from The Children of the Damned all the way through to The Children of the Corn.  Whatever the case may be...there's something very special about Esther!  I can't recommend this movie enough to fans of the genre!  The family's home is beautiful, as well as the Canadian scenery used to add another special quality to this film which would otherwise be lacking!  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I felt that most everything that was included in the film was needed to further the plot along.  There were no elements of it that weren't necessary.  Whether it was meant to establish the relationship between the husband and the wife...and their issues, or the parents' relationship with their children...it was all NECESSARY!  In the end, all the elements come together and we are presentedwith a film that amazes us, surprises us and maybe even frightens us a bit!  There are funny moments throughout that provide us with a sense of dark humor, but when it comes down to it, this is not a funny film, but a deeply disturbing movie!  It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout it's 2 hour running time. In fact, I hated to see it end.  I will revisit this little treasure again, as well as adding it to my personal movie collection!  There are a few surprises thrown into this film that might surprise you.  It will keep you on edge and you WILL genuinely care about the characters in the movie.  Having seen numerous horror thrillers, I believe that this added something special to the genre that we don't see very much: a talented cast of actors giving it all they've got in order to make a believable movie for the audience to enjoy!  Great acting in a horror thriller is few and far between!  This film is definitely NOT for children and although this is not a gory picture...it is still very disturbing!  I am particularly fond of movies that can touch us emotionally, and yet, disturb us as well!  You feel the love of the parents for their children and vice versa.  As well, the relationship between the parents is very well written and it adds a dynamic to the new developing relationship between Esther and her new dad!  At the same time that mom and dad are drifting apart...it is helping to bring the developing father/daughter relationship closer together!  Being that Esther is so manipulative...she had dad playing right into her hands...or so she thinks. At the same time...she makes it look as if mom's prior alcohol problem is beginning to resurface again!  The young actors in this film are very convincing and as they are threatened, scared and concerned for their lives...we see it in their faces and they portray their roles with much accuracy!  The role of Esther was brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Fuhrman.  It is probably the best single performance of a childactress in the history of this genre!  However, I truly hope that this role does not come back to haunt her...as her acting is very versatile...so Hollywood should take notice of this up and coming STAR!  All in all, you will be impressed by the acting skills of the entire family in this movie!  They all gave 110% to their roles!  The Orphan is a disturbing film guaranteed to keep you entertained the entire time you sit in front of the screen.  The movie is guaranteed to throw a surprise at you before it's over and I doubt very much that you figure out what it is!  The characters are very well developed and the character of Esther was brilliantly portrayed. There is a sense of innocence present...but beneath the facade lies a very dangerous, manipulative and sadistic personality!  Isabelle shows great ability in her portrayal of this complex character!  The movie offers much sentiment early on and this helps us later to care for the film's characters more than we would if they hadn't been so well developed!  It seems that this little girl is intent on tearing her new family apart.  She does her best to fit in...but it's difficult for a disturbed child like Esther to make friends...much less to keep them.  Mom and brother suspect that things are not as they seem and over the course of the movie, we realize this as well.  The intriguing thing is that the audience cannot wait to see what will happen next...and that's how I knew that I was witnessing a great film!  I was truly surprised as the movie went along with many of the twists thrown into the mix.  This is a five star thriller with fantastic actors and a fantastic script.  As the movie's tagline says, \\"There's Something Wrong With Esther.\\"  As well, there is something wrong with you if you don't see this movie!  Enjoy! Highly Recommended!
0156711427|5.0|There is little I can say in this review that can't be found in other reviews: many readers have provided good summations of the plot, as well as appreciative commentary on Forster's prose, in their reviews of this novel. And, of course, there is the usual griping from students for whom \\" A Passage of India\\" is required reading. I can only offer this bit of perspective. Once, a few decades ago, the novel was required reading for me, too, and I recall liking it well enough to want to see the film when it came out. Then, \\"A Passage to India\\" gathered dust on my shelves for quite a while. Recently, I picked it up again, wondering how a novel published in 1924 would hold up, especially compared to some of the fine novels about India that have been published in the last decade: Mistry's \\"A Fine Balance,\\"  Adiga's \\"The White Tiger, Roy's \\"The God of Small Things, Desai's \\"The Inheritance of Loss,\\" among others.<br /><br />It held up. I enjoyed it thoroughly, probably more than the first time I read it. So if it has been a long time since you read\\" A Passage to India,\\" pick it up again. And if you're at student struggling to appreciate it, finish the novel and put it away for a few decades. You'll like it better the second time. \\"A Passage to India\\" is one of those great books that, like Conrad's \\" Heart of Darkness,\\"  is indispensable to an understanding of imperialism
0452286751|5.0|I first read this as a senior in high school. I was working as a copy boy at a local newspaper, and it was recommended to me by one of the staffers.    I purchased it recently as one of the two books (the other is \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\") that I will lend to friends if our conversation ever happens to drift toward one of those two books.
0316154687|5.0|David Sedaris outdoes himself in this book.  I probably I should feel sorry for him because his upbringing was so dysfunctional, but I can't stop laughing.  I would have loved to have met his mother.  I would love to take a language class with David Sedaris.  I would love even more to meet Mr. Sedaris.  What else is there to say?  The man is brilliant and funny, and you just can't go wrong with that combination.  He sees things in a way I could never even dream of.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book.  Even if you hate it, you will learn something, and improve your vocabulary!
1590171993|4.0|Ever browse a bookstore and come across a book being marketed as a classic -- except that you've never heard of it? That, for me, is Stoner, by John Williams. Stoner is the last name of the main character, whose life we follow from the time he leaves his small farm household as a youth to attend college.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written story, following Stoner's life as he discovers a love of language and literature, and a love of place at the University of Missouri, where he begins his career.<br /><br />Along the way, Stoner marries and finds love (in that order), enters into friendships and prickly professional rivalries, and seems at times to move through his life with a frustrating lack of insight. This frustrated me to no end as I read: I found myself urging Stoner on to more decisiveness, more backbone, more grabbing of happiness when it was within reach. Yet, I am left with the nagging suspicion that the Stoner we see in this book is more realistic than the Stoner I wanted to see. After all, we all do the best we can without the benefit of hindsight. We aren't guided by an omniscient narrator who can help us think through our next steps. If and when we find happiness, we have to savor it among our various missteps and regrets. Not that we can't be happy or lead happy lives -- it's just that our happiness always has a context.<br /><br />And so it was that, finishing Stoner, I initially felt pretty low, sad for Stoner and his life full of missed opportunities and damaged relationships. That is, until I read an excerpt from an interview with the author, who himself asserted that Stoner \\"had a very good life.\\"<br /><br />\\"You never know the results of what you do,\\" continued Williams. \\"You've got to keep the faith.\\" And this is just what our protagonist Stoner does. Looking back at this book in light of the author's statements, there is indeed a faint glimmer of salvation for all of us as we take our tentative steps, and missteps, through our lives.
B0001L3LUE|3.0|After Robert McNamara died on July 6, 2009, I revisited \\"The Fog of War\\" documentary to see if the lapse of time would uncover new insights.<br /><br />This time, I found that Errol Morris creates a greater impression than is warranted that McNamara and Lyndon Johnson are making life-and-death decisions in a bungling, indecisive, and backroom manner, almost like two guys making policy in a bar.  As if an anti-hero in the panoply of military commanders, Johnson comes across as a hayseed, fretful about possible criticism from the emerging counter-culture power base within his party, yet unable to commit to a whatever-it-takes military strategy to defeat the enemy.  Shouldn't Morris have protectively edited out Johnson's hot-button ignorance of the good/well distinction?<br /><br />Unlike Morris, Jonah Goldberg seems to find the seeds of America's military wishy-washiness in our refusal to help the French volunteers at Dien Bien Phu in 1954:  \\"Had Eisenhower supported the French requests to use our bombers based in the Philippines to bomb around Dien Bien Phu, Ho Chi Minh may have not been able to form a government. To his shame, Eisenhower refused to do it unless he had support from all the Congressional leaders, and Lyndon Johnson (to his greater shame) did not support it.\\"  Will no one tally the lives lost in the years following such weakness?  Couldn't we just as easily argue that front-end ruthlessness costs a few high-profile lives (the more dramatic, the greater the deterrence) but actually saves countless lives in the long run?<br /><br />For example, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, heading a monarchy begun in 1501, was brought down in 1979, with the tacit support of President Jimmy Carter, who has never acknowledged the cost in blood and suffering and a weaker West that followed in the wake of his decision not to back the Shah.<br /><br />Robert McNamara seems to follow in the footsteps of George C. Marshall, both of whom seem to be models of the preferred military decision-maker today: logistical, operational planners who read data sheets to move armies logically and methodically.  Though this type of thinking has always been necessary to fight a war successfully, it seems very contemporary that we elevate its strategic role in the leadership hierarchy.  But should the computer-girded quartermaster be turned into a policy implementer?<br /><br />Film director Errol Morris is at his best when he makes Robert McNamara the foil of Curtis LeMay.  McNamara's  Harvard think-tank stint as AAF analytical advisor in the early 40s, followed by his service in AAF's Office of Statistical Control, gave him a life-long (though grudging) respect for LeMay.  As McNamara describes,<br /><br />  \\"The U.S. was just beginning to bomb. We were bombing by daylight. The loss rate was very, very high, so they commissioned a study. And what did we find? We found the abort rate was 20%. 20% of the planes that took off to bomb targets in Germany turned around before they got to their target. Well that was a hell of a mess? we lost 20% of our capability right there.<br />  \\"The form, I think it was form 1--A or something like that was a mission report. And if you aborted a mission you had to write down `why.' So we get all these things and we analyze them, and we finally concluded it was baloney. They were aborting out of fear.<br />  \\"Because the loss rate was 4% per sortie, the combat tour was 25 sorties--it didn't mean that 100% of them were going to be killed but a hell of a lot of them were going to be killed. They knew that and they found reasons to not go over the target. So we reported this.<br />  \\"One of the commanders was Curtis LeMay--Colonel in command of a B--24 group. He was the finest combat commander of any service I came across in war. But he was extraordinarily belligerent, many thought brutal. He got the report. He issued an order. He said, 'I will be in the lead plane on every mission. Any plane that takes off will go over the target, or the crew will be court--marshaled.' The abort rate dropped over night.\\"<br /><br />LeMay seems to come across as having the now-lost profile of leadership that might actually win a war.  Even McNamara sensed that the firebombing of Tokyo, with the unfortunate death of 100,000 not-so-innocent civilians, was a necessary \\"overkill\\" tactic to get Japan to give up the war, thus saving a million or more combatants (on both sides) in later battles and a planned invasion of the Japanese homeland.  It's strange that the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is often seen differently.--marshaled.'

068484267X|1.0|My sister gave me a copy of this book. I had heard about it from her, and looked forward to reading it.   I felt sadness for little Frankie, anger for his father who was a slave to alcohol, amazement at his mother for laying it bed or staring into the ashes while her children went neglected.  Mr. McCourt died just a short time back. God rest his soul. But one recurrent thought I had while reading was \\"How can he remember so many minute details from so long ago?\\"   All in all, the story was interesting at first, but became very repetitive after a while. I found myself thinking something GOOD was bound to happen to redeem the story, but it never did. The whole book could of been summed up by saying, \\"we lived in squalor with stinking chamberpots, Dad drank the dole money instead of buying food, my sister died, my brother died, and then things got worse.\\"  The worst part of the whole book for me: Here is this little boy, you feel sad for him, you want things to get better for him, and then toward the end of the book he becomes totally self absorbed, steals, commits adultery with a girl who is dying of TB, and \\"interferes with himself\\" (ahem) all over the countryside.
B001FB4W02|5.0|I must admit that I've never been a big time CW viewer but for three yrs running now I've gradually got hooked on this show.  While it can be downright confusing following the plot and storylines coming late to this series I find it the most enjoyable weekly series viewing.  This show has it all and the HD Quality is fantastic as are the beautiful people cast in the roles we view.  It sort of reminds me when I was younger and lived close to where I worked and I'd go home for lunch and view All My Children and got addicted viewing it.  This thing has many soap opera elements that bait you and may annoy but at the same time baits you to continue watching.    I've never viewed a series that from season to season they alter the thing so much but you continue following though your thoughts may be where the hell this person went especially when they do the reruns out of sequence.  This is simply the best looking group of people I've ever seen on TV and damn why isn't Tom Weller doing Superman on the big screen? Makes one wonder what they could do with this with a Big Screen budget and Tom Weller deserves it and while I'm a guy and not gay I must say this guy is one of the best looking men on screen and he plays the role amazingly well - though at times the constrast can be annoying where they make him too vulnerable or to be blunt too much a pussy for someone that's Superman but when needed he grows a pair and prevails.  While it irks me that they don't have him flying I find it now pleasurable to see them having him evolve and grow and perhaps he finds that flying is always faster than running.;)     I find most serial programming to be boring and redundant at my mid life age but the quirky changing storyline keeps me hooked and the quality of this show for something on CW is fantastic and how they do it week after week.  Has anyone else wanted Superman to grab Chloe and get it on - she is hot in a sort of girl next door way! Smallville has great genetic code as it's rare you find any cast member that's not beautiful and now we get a Justice League added to the mix!  I do miss Lex Luther though I must admit but they keep him in the mix with no physical presence to bring him back to life if they choose much like a good Soap Opera does.      Considering my viewing was pretty much limited to the past 3 years it makes me wonder what I missed from the first five seasons but has this showed matured well despite it making it challenging to follow the constant changing storyline and character rotations - somehow they do it and it works for me.      I'll gladly view season 9 on Friday nights and gradually add a Blu-Ray library as I find the rest of Friday Night viewing truly sucks as Ghost Whisperer has gotten a little kooky and redundant SOSO.  The cast on Smallville and the production quality and Soap Opera Sci-fi make it a pleasure to enjoy and nothing else on TV compares outside the Tudors series on Showtime another sort of brutal Superman with a Soap flare.     Enjoy! Fly Fly Fly Tom!!!
B0019OP0GU|5.0|One of the most engaging movies I have seen for a long time is the 2008 BBC production of \\"Ballet Shoes;\\" a meditation on creative talent and perseverance. Based on the Noel Streatfeild 1993 novel of the same title set in London in the 1930's, the storyline of the film moves fast and holds your attention to the very end. The dialogue is spirited and expressive. Cast as young orphans in three key roles are Lucy Boynton, an aspiring ballerina, Emma Watson, a promising actor, and Yasmin Paige, a mechanically inclined girl who wants to fly airplanes.<br />  The additional cast of Eileen Atkins, Peter Bowles, Lucy Cohu, Emilia Fox, Richard Griffiths, Gemma Jones, Adrian Lester, Harriet Walter, Marc Warren and Victoria Wood play first-rate supporting roles.<br />  An exclusive interview with Emma Watson -- a charming extra feature on this DVD -- shows her to be a truly accomplished young artist.
B000JRYNXE|5.0|The melody interwoven with Gwen Stefani's staccato delivery and the beat of each song created an excellent pick-me-up album. From \\"Wind It Up,\\" through each song--\\"The Sweet Escape,\\" \\"Now That You Got It,\\" \\"Breakin' Up,\\" \\"Don't Get It Twisted,\\" and others in between--to \\"Wonderful Life\\" offer imaginative variations to a thematic score: the first encounters of lust through the complexities of a physical and emotional relationship to self-realization. The Sweet Escape is a wonderful musical journey through emotions.

B00204AA0O|4.0|I am a huge fan of Regina Spektor's work, and have been anticipating this album as soon as i knew of its possible existence.  I'm not going to lie, at first listen, I was a bit disappointed. Begin to Hope, while still a work of art, is not my favorite of Regina's, and I was terribly afraid that \\"Far\\" would be an album full of pop-y songs similar to Fidelity.  At first glance, my fears seemed to come true, but i listened a second time, and found a the album's charm.  Then came a third, fourth, fifth listen, etc...and now im completely hooked.  Every time i listen, I'm reminded of Regina's impeccable ability to manipulate a seemingly simple melody into something much more complex.  I can't stop listening to it!  Soviet Kitsch  is still by far my favorite, but Far does not disappoint.  Notable tracks are Blue Lips, Eet, Human of the Year, Calculation, and of course, Laughing With.

B000I2J6K0|5.0|OK.  So this is my fifth pregnancy and I have tried several pregnancy DVDs over the past 7 years.  For me this one far surpasses ALL of the others.  Here is my fitness background...I run four days a week, about 3 miles each time and follow that with a fifteen minute workout on a total gym (the Chuck Norris one).  I consider myself to be a very active stay at home mom with four young children.  I have managed to sustain an acceptable level of fitness and was able to complete this DVD upon my first attempt.  That doesn't mean I found it easy!  Far from it, but the competitive spirit within me drives me on!!        I was initially concerned that this workout wouldn't contain enough cardio, but Erin O'Brien doesn't let up for breaks (apart from the necessary bathroom ones!) and consequently I finished feeling quite challenged without being totally out of breath.  This is a complete body workout, so if you are not working out most of your muscle groups on a semi regular basis, you may want to start with the Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout..sadly it is 20 years old and a bit dated, but hey, if it gets you going and helps you tackle this DVD, a couple of weeks of dated workouts is worth it!    One criticism.  The partner workout with her husband is a little corny.  My husband would probably have a heart attack if I asked him to do it with me and while I don't have many inhibitions, this would be the limit of embarrassment.  I really don't see the need for this section, since Erin covers all muscle groups in the inidividual workout, which by the way my kids did with me!!        All in all, this is a no mess about pregnancy workout for women who are serious about maintaining their physical fitness while pregnant and if you have 40 minutes several times a week this is the one for you.

0736695338|4.0|I'm not a baseball fan, but Aaron Sorkin is one of my favorite writers.  So when I heard that he'd been hired to write a screenplay based on this book, I ordered it from my library, specifically, the unabridged Books On Tape version, a fine reading by Scott Brick.    This is a glorious story of the unconventional triumphing over the typical, and it's easy to see why Columbia wants to turn it into a picture.  And why they hired Sorkin.  Moneyball is totally a story he can \\"hit out of the park,\\" his Sports Night was a show you didn't need to love sports to love, either.      Lewis tells his story so well that even a non baseball fan like me can get caught up in the love of the game--at least for the hours I was listening.      Less clear is why Brad Pitt, who is \\"attached to the project,\\" should star in the film version--nothing against Pitt, but the story I heard doesn't seem to need a popular sex symbol.      In fact, one of the great ideas of the Oakland A's management covered by the book is that they should concentrate on guys who can play, no matter what they look like, not so much on studs who can \\"sell jeans.\\"      This idea was not exactly loved in big league baseball, so I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that a movie studio hasn't taken it on either...
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|\\"Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.  And I want my scalps.\\"<br /><br />Quentin Tarantino's \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is not the film I was expecting.  It's not even the film I wanted, to tell you the truth.  But no director defies expectations so consistently nor delivers more spectacularly in the modern age of cinema and so still had one hell of a time anyways.  And if the reaction of the audience I saw it with is any indication, so will everyone else; disregarding, of course, the ever-present cinematic malcontents who continue to rush to midnight premiere screenings of every single Tarantino film in spite of their professed hatred for his work.  Gotta love those guys.  Simply and predictably put, this is a WWII film like no other and is you typical QT mishmash of genres, obscure references and homages, and tributes to all the things the eccentric director himself likes; things like ladies' feet and German silent films.  And contrary to what one might assume, this is not a remake of the WWII cult classic [[ASIN:B00140PKEQ The Inglorious Bastards]].  No topless machine-gun toting Nazi girls for you.  Sorry.<br /><br />Now, if there is one thing that never, ever goes out of style, it's killing Nazis.  Even in this politically correct age, few will complain about anything that is said about or done to a Nazi no matter how cruel and unusual.  They are the one group we can all agree can never truly get everything they deserve as far as abuse goes.  Tarantino took this opportunity to take this premise to a comical extreme.  I can honestly say I've never seen a brutal and explicit baseball bat beating applauded quite so enthusiastically or blatant nationalist slurs laughed at so heartily.  That is both the magic of Tarantino's unique cinematic styling and the legacy of the Holocaust put together in one cathartic release over 2 1/2 hours of film that actually leave you wanting more.  Originally, Tarantino wanted this story to be a miniseries and that tidbit sheds a lot of light on the inadequacies of this film.  The Nazi-hunters known as The Basterds play a much smaller role in the story then I would have liked and there is a lot less violence then one would think a film about a Jewish unit of Nazi-killers would have. The tales of a Jewish girl who escaped the SS years ago and hid in Paris as a theater owner and a German actress working against her own country take up much screen time, but are fascinating in their own right.  Tarantino's dialogue is as unmistakable and captivating as ever.  Not only is most of the film simple dialogue, but I'd estimate about 2/3 of it is not in even in English.  Taking place in German-occupied France, most of the characters speak French and German....and maybe a little Italian [snicker].  Coupled with the persistent references to old-school German cinema, this is QT foisting his personal cinematic preferences on the audience once again.  Love it when he does that.<br /><br />So the pacing isn't quite what it should be and the multiple plot threads leave surprisingly little time for the amount of carnage I was hoping for.  Big deal.  Tarantino knows how to shoot his actors for maximum coolness, build suspense while creating a genuine flow and menace to each conversation even as he works his black comedic magic, and most of all his legendary capacity for maximizing his actor's performances in on display here as well.  Brad Pitt is hilarious with his exaggerated Tennessee drawl and matter-of-fact delivery.  But though he is the biggest name and personality on the cast, this movie is not about him.  M&eacute;lanie Laurent is both lovely, sympathetic, convincing, and in the end even a little demonic as Shosanna, the Jewish escapee who runs the Paris cinema where the Third Reich wishes to premiere their latest and greatest propaganda film.  Christoph Waltz is simply amazing as the SS's \\"Jew Hunter\\" and exudes a calculating malevolent friendliness that makes it impossible to look awaywhen he's onscreen.  Maybe a little too much time is spent watching these characters pontificate at length with one another, but considering there is only one source for this particular brand of stylized storytelling, I'm not complaining too loudly.  The occasional touches of ridiculous humor (nice pipe, dude) kept me on my toes if nothing else.<br /><br />There are two shots near the end of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" that are so awe-inspiring and cool that they would be worth the 2 1/2 hour wait by themselves.  I wish I could describe them to you without spoilers.  Let me just quote the scene itself and say \\"This is the face of Jewish vengeance!\\"  I got major goosebumps. If you thought Death Proof was dull and stupid, walk on by.  This is not a wall-to-wall gorefest and it's not exactly going to please WWII historians either.  And if you're German...well, I hope you're very comfortable with yourself and have a good sense of humor about this stuff.  This movie is about quirky and deliberately -paced dialogue and other things that the part of you that ran to see \\"Transformers\\" and \\"GI Joe\\" aren't going to appreciate much.  This movie is not a masterpiece by any stretch, but it's still a rewarding film for the patient and has plenty of that QT unpredictability punctuated with moments of sheer insanity.  Enjoy it or unleash your trollish flames upon this reviewer.  Either will make me very happy.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars, rounded up for shoving foreign cinema down America's throat.a little too much time is spent watching these characters pontificate at length with one another, but considering there is only one source for this particular brand of stylized storytelling, I'm not complaining too loudly.

B002JWD6AS|5.0|I LOVED this book.  The main characters are caught in a doomed romance and its completely engaging even without a lot of action.
B000P0J09W|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, she loved it.   Great shape and delivery. Would do business with again.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I first heard of Melody on the local jazz station in Seattle and had to try out her cd.  Bought this one and Worrisome Heart and haven't been this pleased with a music purchase in a long time.  Melody is an amazing talent, writes her own songs and has an incredible voice and only in her 20's. An old soul in a young case. Can only imagine how she will progress, intend to follow her closely.  Hope more cd's are on the way as its so nice to put the ones I have on and relax.  Very soothing, no \\"in your face\\" here.
6300268470|5.0|Great actors/acting!Even a bit of great singing as a bonus.Of course it is a classic by now, but I just saw it for the first time. I absolutely LOVED IT!I'll be watching this again and again. Forgot for the moment that all the actors are gone.This movie stands the tests of time. I can't say enough good things about it, but also I'm sure the other positive reviews have covered everything.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|(I love the series already, and as I assume you do too if you're considering this item, I'm just reviewing the product:) This pink, velvety-covered book, containing all episodes of Sex and the City, as well as a few extras on DVD, is a worthy investment. The set can be perfect as a coffee table book and it keeps the discs in great condition. Each season has a color theme and image that keeps the discs organized and fun to choose from. While I wish there had been more extras, I still think that this set is a must-have for fans. Although you can buy the series separately for 105 dollars, if you are a true lover of Sex and the City, the extra money for the gift set is money well spent to have all the discs in one place... and a pretty place at that.
B0025VLELQ|5.0|I've seen this movie a zillion times. Many movies aren't worth getting the Blu-ray version. But this movie looks amazing in Blu-ray. At 1080p, the computer animation looks better than ever. If you're  fan of The Last Starfighter, then get the Blu-ray. You won't regret it. Also the \\"Heros of The Last Starfighter\\" segment is a great bonus. I don't remember seeing it on the DVD version.
015206396X|5.0|I have never been so proud of a female protagonist in a work of YA literature before until I read Graceling. Katsa truly is an inspiring character, which makes her point of view narrative very appealing to teenage girls who have/desire both physical and inner strength. Her values our her own values which do not change for anybody. She discourages the institutionalized feminine aspect of vulnerability, indecision, and male-dependence (sadly, like most of the female protagonists which are sadly taking over YA literature). But what I most love about her is that she is a character I haven't really read before. She isn't too powerful or hard-headed, because she does have moments of human vulnerability like her weakness to Po's allure (what woman can't resist a handsome man's tempting, yet mischievous glare). And even in those times, she fails to completely succumb to such weaknesses when necessary to be strong. She astounds you by her invincibility and you desire her confidence and resistance to fear.    Enough of the characterization, for I must review the novel as a whole. Kristen Cashore has definetly made a unique, quality story. Nothing is too overexaggerated (including the supernatural aspects which could even be believable if not clearly fictional). Her storytelling is in a perfect pace. Her details are neither so tedious to read that you're left getting dragged nor too simple to read that you feel left behind throughout the story. The personalities of her characters makes them easy to remember. The only faults I find about the novel is that Cashore never clearly clarifies the physical aspects of the characters (except what makes them distinguishable), but I guess it's up to our own character imagery. I also don't like how some of the main or stand-out characters don't really end up very significant to the plot. Katsa drives the whole story which can get pretty boring to some readers if you hate or don't care for the character.    I must say this is my first timereviewing on Amazon and after finishing this novel about 3 hours before I am writing this very review, I feel very happy on how unconventional the plot turned out. There were some stubborn or unwanted moments in the story that made me shake my head in disappointment, and some disturbing aspects that made my face grimace. But in the end, I am very happy with what I read and even feel like taking up some self-defense classes. (Hoping desperately for Cashore to write another great novel).
B00009V7OR|5.0|I love the movie and I have been waiting to own it! ! ! !  Always get (2-disc) when you can.  I had it on U-Verse DVR but I prefer no commercials and it freed up 3 hours of space for other items.  A must for Will Smith fans!!!
B000LXZUPQ|5.0|i am a moody blues fan. own several of their albums all titles are great listening.got into listening to the moodies back in the late1960s. really started to appreciate them in 1970s
B00005JLD4|4.0|Rabbit-Proof Fence is a moving tale, as much for its content as for the very fact that the film was made. One has to applaud Phillip Noyce for taking on the project, for the story of the multi-generational theft of half-Aboriginal children is not a proud chapter in Australia's history. The fervor with which so many people still defend the intent, if not the actual text, of the Aborigines Protection Act (which, among other things, allowed half-caste children to be forcibly removed from their parents without any justification) simply proves how shameful it was. Denial is a powerful substitute for guilt.<br /><br />In making this film, Noyce had a monumental job ahead of him. He had to work with untrained child actors, pay heed to historical accuracy, and generate sympathy without slipping into cliches--all of which he accomplished with the aid of some stunning cinematography and a haunting soundtrack by Peter Gabriel. Noyce,  unwittingly, also ended up having to educate the children in their own sad history. (As one of the cast so poignantly put it, they \\"lost their innocence\\" during the filming.) Although a lot of controversy surrounds the \\"Stolen Generations,\\" if there is any doubt in anyone's mind that the theft of these children was anything less than a tragedy, watch the Special Features. During the scene in which the children are carried away, the actresses playing the mothers could not stop crying. They huddled in a group and wailed until their \\"stolen children\\" were brought back to them. Even after 40 years the tears are still flowing.<br /><br />In spite of the fact that the film could have used a bit more historical context, and more details showing how the three girls survived a 900-mile trek through the Australian Outback, this film is highly recommended.
B001P3SA94|4.0|The movie was informative as a history of the blues but did leave a few things unanswered.  Overall it was a good movie and if you like the blues, the music is very good.
0385341008|1.0|This is not a book that I would typically read, but it certainly has been discussed quite a bit.  I gave it a shot.  It was awful--incredibly trite, sanitized, completely devoid of any real human emotions.  It's just a caricature of some quirky individuals who \\"aren't going to let those darn Nazis get them down\\".  All of the plot devices are totally worn and obvious.  All of these observations are from the first half of the book.  I seriously doubt there will be any improvement in the second half of the book.  Guess I'll never know, because I can't finish it.  This is not a book for true lovers of great literature--at best, a \\"beach read\\".
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I LOVE this album! I didn't even realize it came with the videos, but it was a wonderful surprise. The 2008 remixes are good, and I love love love 'For All Time'. If you are having any doubts, don't...just buy it!!!
0307454541|2.0|The person who reccommended this book to me said she had read Reginald Hill [[ASIN:1933397934 A Clubbable Woman (Felony & Mayhem Mysteries)]] and that I would therfore enjoy The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Unfortunately Larsson doesn't hold a flashlight to Hill, so I was very disappointed.<br />Basically, I found the book boring and the pomposity of the author made itself felt throughout. The girl with the dragon tattoo should have been the main character, but it seemed that even the author himself didn't really feel he could trust her, so decided to put everything in the hands of the macho, dismally dependable and politically correct male character, Blomkvist.<br />I grappled with drooping eyelids throughout the 600 some-odd pages, hoping that the book would redeem itself, but alas, for me it never did.<br />However, the sequel, a chapter of which is given as a teaser at the end of the book, seems to start off better, but I doubt whether I'll buy it.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I know Thriller is the biggest selling album of all time, but I like the Bad album even better! It's so sexy!!
B001FB4VZS|3.0|I loved the fact that when the producers were first making this series it would give a more background detail of the early years of Clark Kent before his emergence into the man of steel,  but after these many years can or should this show even be called Smallville anymore?  Some of the storylines go past the early years of Superman like the Doomsday scenario and the romance of Lois Lane and Clark Kent which if you're a hardcore comics fan might be a little irritating to watch as it seems to just go so far into the storyline of Superman that you just wonder why they don't call it the Superman show.  The cast are still great for their character roles and seeing the cameo appearance of other super hero's like Flash, Cyborg, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, and the Green Arrow as well as Zantana were enjoyable too it still is a little annoying that Clark just doesn't get his famous tights and take the name Superman since it seems that every other thing in the Superman universe is here.  The effects and video for this set are still great and for the price very affordable so if you're like me and just are a completest go ahead and get the set, but if you're one of the hardcore comic fans of Superman you might be a little irritated at how mixed-up they made the series...
0756405890|5.0|When I began reading this book I wasn't so sure I was going to like it. The story starts off at a bar with your basic bar goers sharing stories over ale. This goes on for about a chapter or so, but I never give up on a book on the first chapters, and I'm glad I didn't! Patrick Rothfuss really hit it off after that and it's been the hardest book to put down in a long time for me.    The story is told by Kvothe, the main character. He takes us back to his childhood, which began as a happy time with his beloved parents. He then tells us how he ended up in the streets, struggling to survive a world unfamiliar and cruel and finally how he got admitted to the University, which different struggles awaited him.     Rothfuss writes a very character driven stories, the depth of his character much reminded me that of Fitz from Hobb's books.  The joy, the fear, the heart breaks, all can be experienced in this book. I strongly suggest it to any fantasy fan.
0810160064|5.0|what a wonderful book.. if you ever dreamed of traveling through a country with a donkey read this book.
B000ZEE3I6|5.0|This movie visually brought the book alive for me.  I always know they can't put the whole book in a movie and they do their best to incorporate the important parts, so this movie touched on all the really important aspects of the story. Loved it!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I've never been much of a TV fan. Most shows are okay to kill time if that's what you need, but they are hardly must see entertainment. LOST is the exception to that rule. I came upon this show by accident and it has been a huge part of my life each season. Season 5 might well be the most ambitious and epic of all so far which is saying a lot. You won't regret it, especially on DVD, which is how I got hooked and much more fun than waiting for a week between episodes. LOST rules!
159102594X|3.0|I have to say I have never read a better book about nothing. Some characters in this book are extremely unlikeable, others are mildly unlikeable, and some are just ok. This is certainly a band of misfits coming together to do...well...I'm not sure exactly. This book was entirely character setup and introductions. There may be an attack of northerners at some time, I'm not sure. There seems to be a prophecy about something also. I really wish this book would have given me some reason to continue reading, a hint of a plot, something. Oh well, I loved it, and you will probably love it too. The characters are unique, enjoyable, interesting, and that is enough really to keep my interest in a novel. I want to know what happens to them so I will continue reading. I would highly recommend this book.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Released in 2007, this is an electrifying album that has a good balance of the artier aspects of progressive rock and heavy metal - as a longtime fan of 1970s progressive rock, it kept me very entertained.  Indeed, this gave me the same level of enjoyment my old Yes and Return to Forever records brought me.<br /><br />The lineup includes John Petrucci (electric and acoustic guitars, backing vocals), John Myung (electric bass guitars), Mike Portnoy (drums, percussion, and vocals), James LaBrie (vocals), and Jordan Rudess (piano, Hammond organ, synthesizers).  Much to my surprise (and delight) both John Myung and Jordan Rudess are audible!  They both add a great deal to the compositions, which really come alive with John's thunderous bass lines and the creative virtuosity of Jordan.  Speaking of which, the level of virtuosity on this album is simply mind-blowing.<br /><br />The eight tracks range in length from 5 minutes to the nearly 26 minute long, two-part In the Presence of Enemies suite, and present a blend of progressive rock and heavy metal (actually, the balance is further on the progressive rock side).  While the emphasis is on ensemble work of considerable complexity, and ostinati played at a breakneck tempo (in unison on the keyboards/guitar/bass) and at ear-splitting levels, there are \\"artier\\" passages that feature subdued electric and acoustic instruments.  This contrast is emphasized by a wide dynamic range. The tone colors that Jordan selects including the mellotron and acoustic piano also add a lot to the \\"artiness\\" factor.  The melodies are everywhere (and haunting at times) and both the lead and backing vocal harmonies are excellent.  I also enjoy the more experimental passages - that is, the \\"proggier\\" stuff (Repentance is a good example) along with the \\"ballad-ish\\" moments.<br /><br />This is a nice CD package that features great artwork by Hugh Syme, the lyrics, and photos of the group.  The production is also quite good - again, I can hear John Myung and Jordan Rudess.<br /><br />All in all, this may very well be one of my favorites by the group and is certainly one of their \\"artier\\" albums.  Very highly recommended to prog fans that do not mind some heavy metal and heavy metal fans that do not mind a good dose of progressive rock along with Octavarium (2005), Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (2002), and Scenes from a Memory (1999)..

0307278255|4.0|After reading her previous work, The Namesake, I was eagerly anticipating reading Unaccustomed Earth.  Unaccustomed Earth is a collection of 8 stories, in which the protagonists are all  Indian.  Overall, I was pleased with this book, but while reading it, I got the feeling that happens when you read a good book: you don't want it to end.<br /><br />The stories have the common theme of differing cultures and growing pains between generations.  Bengali parents have immigrated from India so that their children will receive a better education and hopefully a better way of life.  Lahiri beautifully weaves the intricacies and difficulties that exist and develop when children are raised in an American society but have parents that still cling to their roots. As an American born Asian, I understand what both the children and the parents are going through, and Lahiri captures it beautifully.<br /><br />My favorite story was of Hema and Kaushik.  It was the most developed and intricate.  The story began with both Hema and Kaushik as children, and extends until middle age.  It was wonderfully crafted, and unlike the other stories, there was an ending, a sense of closure which left me satisfied, although also sad.<br /><br />While I enjoyed The Namesake more, Unaccustomed Earth is a moving book and a great read.
B001GSV3EC|3.0|No, Jeff Beck is not the greatest guitar virtoso, as one reviewer called him. Perhaps I should have purchased the DVD of this singular concert which apparently included vocal performances with other talented singers and musicians. This CD version of the concert does have many memorable tracks, and can be recommended, but with reservations. I do not know who was the engineer for this concert but the levels were way out of wack. I had to equalize these recordings enormously to get the levels back into a listenable sound. The bass, even for those who love loud heavy bass sounds, overwhelmed many of the tracks and created much distortion. Jeff Beck is certainly a hugely talented guitarist, but admittedly, I was disappointed by the lack of variety of guitar sounds. Every track has the same tubular Stratocaster sound to it, though variously manipulated. Perhaps he is going for a pure sound to showcase his nimble fingers, but one would think that different guitars for different songs would be appropriate. I was a bit disappointed also in some of the sloppiness in his playing. I have been following Jeff's career since the mid seventies. I know his live recordings are often wild and untamed. I would have thought after decades of playing guitar, and with his considerable talent, he might have felt the need to clean up his playing.    Overall, for guitarists and those who enjoy Jeff's music from way back, this is still an important and memorable contribution to his work. I can recommend this CD, but with reservations that this is not as groundbreaking as many other jazz-fusion recordings.
0307277453|5.0|This is the best book I've read on human evolution yet. The author's writing style in engaging, and the information he details is fascinating. How he connects the dots, all the bits of information, is truly enlightening, detailing how our varied body parts have evolved from a multitude of creatures over time. I enjoyed this book from the first page to the last. He did a super job of showing how fossils, genes, and embryology work to show how everything comes together. You don't often get those three sciences in one book, and what a delightful way he organized it so it was easy to understand, easy to digest, and easy to see the patterns in evolution.<br /><br />I hope we get more books from this author. What a treat this book was!

B001OQCV9M|4.0|Cute without breaking into cloying, Nora Ephrons' \\"Julie and Julia\\" does an extraordinary job in running the parallel stories of Julie (Amy Adams, always perky) and Julia Child (Meryll Streep, more ham than a cook book allows) discovering themselves through the world of cooking. Filled with good humor and sumptuous views of food, it's a family film that is more for the family than the kids. Oh, and if you're a foodie? This is borderline food-porn.<br /><br />A lot of the F-P aspect has to do with the cooking, which is done is such detail that \\"Julie and Julia\\" is almost a love letter to the value of a good kitchen. Julie works in a cruddy cubicle job, lives in a dingy apartment, and is a frustrated writer who is confounded that her circle of friends has become self-absorbed successes. Her boyfriend convinces her to set up a cooking blog, and Julie settles on \\"The [[ASIN:B000FCKHA6 Julie/Julia: 365 Days, 524 Recipes, 1 Tiny Apartment Kitchen]]\\" project and begins her cooking odyssey.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in 1950's Paris, Julia Child decides she wants to make something of her life, so husband Paul (delightfully dapper Stanley Tucci, deserving of a supporting actor nod) agrees to help her enter a school for French Chefs...and that's when Julia hits on the idea for her cookbook. Julie and Julia's stories then intermingle (although sometimes in a forced fit) that make for good entertainment.<br /><br />The minor dramas in each life are handled well and with taste, such as Child's sadness over infertility, the encroachment of McCarthyism, Julie's \\"meltdowns\\" and her breakup with her boyfriend Eric (Chris Messina). But mostly, this is a love letter to the glory of food and to Julia Child, whom Streep plays with glorious wit and abandon. As she ages, Streep has become more free and graceful, willing to let fly even in the most silly of roles ([[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia!]] anyone) while never allowing any doubt about her acting brilliance. \\"Julie and Julia\\" gets a 4th star on her portrayal of Childs alone. And one more thing...do not watch this film on an empty stomach. Concession stands charge enough as it is.lds alone. And one more thing...do not watch this film on an empty stomach. Concession stands charge enough as it is.
0385342020|5.0|Another Kinsella hit, and done in a  *correct* manner (I wasn't so keen on Confessions of a Shopaholic movie), would make a great movie.<br /><br />The end did seem a bit rushed, but all in all, I found myself laughing out loud and trying to explain why!

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Weather you like him or not, you have to admit Quentin Taretino has a big mouf.  His cockie wisecracks and verbal machinegun filled with pop-referential bullets can make him annoying to the point of manslaughter, but his movies aren't something to look down upon.  A good weight of his filmografy is filled with charm, brilliant writing, and established characters, they're near-classics.  He did stumble with \\"Deathproof\\", which is simply two hours of exposition and only two sequential payofs; that was only a misstep, as the filmmaker manage to get back on his feet with his latest spaghetti wartime parade, \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\"  It's nothing short of what I xpect from the guy, a gloryhole of long-talks and critical violence.<br /><br />Amusingly, yet not entirely surprized, for a film about The Basterds, a good chunk of the 2 1/2 hours has little to do with the skin-scraping, head-bashing club.  The first chapter has a French family getting an unexpected visit from the SS, when the father gets into a heated discussion with a kommendant---<br /><br />Im gonna have to interrupt my own review for a moment to say that Hans Landa has to be one of the best karacters I've seen in films.  Unofficially called \\"The Jew Killer\\", he's the one evil soljer I can never hate; I can hate what he represents, but I admire what he does because he's so pontificating with his job.  He's very punctual with his methods, leaving no thread undiscovered to make him take the furst strike.  The guy doesn't just tell you you're caught, he rubs it in your face with your own soap, yet does it in the most humble wey possible.  As much as I like Brad Pitt's role, the actor who played Hans Landa won my hart with his eccentric performance.<br /><br />---anyway, which circomestances eventually turns things sour on the father.  The third chapter is a continuation of the preloode chapter, which has a female character running a movie theater before an obnoxious actor/Nazi soldier trying to woo her heart.  A series of forced situations led to using her theater as a premiere party for the high-ranks of the SS, include You-Know-Who himself, thus setting up her ultimate revenge skeme.  Five chapters tie the whole ceries of unrelated plot and characters together (the chapter format isn't exactly first for the director), yet the chapters I get to see The Basterds are brief; although, with what little time they had, their tenasidies were iconic.<br /><br />When it comes to The Basterds, the leader hogs up all the gloury.  Brad Pitt plays the leader of the anti-Nazi group, and he's such an interesting in that even though he delivers the goods, he sure don't talk the goods as I've seen some hilarious scenes when his accent worked against him.  He was the showstealer, in fact, he's probably the only show around.  Sure, there was Eli Roth playing a bat-wielding murdertown of the gang, but the rest of the squad don't have any distanctive personalities; I'm disappointed in the Jerman Basterd, he was viewed as a serious threat to the SS, yet he only had one moment to shine, and it wasn't much of a shiner.  I do like the tradition Quentin touch of the film, like the opening credits, the nice use of license songs (mainly by Ennio Morricone), and its narrations with Samuel L. Jackson, although the narration parts were very rere and otherwise pretty irrelevant.<br /><br />From what I heard, the movie has bin receeving the cold shoulder from many critics in the past; I didn't read their reviews, so I can't say I know exactly what was their deal.  It might be the fact that the movie isn't historically accurate, and certainly by the end of the film, Historical Accuracy is to this movie as [[ASIN:1558908242 Marcellus is to Zed]].  However, I don't think Quentin is going four the accurate angle and is doing his usual homage to camp bravado of yesterdecade, and this is a direction most critics should know about already.  Who knows, maybe it's the Mike Myers kameo.<br /><br />That being said, I do have sum complaints.  Pacing doesn't seem to work in the director's favor, as there was a lot of down time with characturs exchanging lines before any real action occurs.  Yea, I'm compleining about too much dialog in a Tarateno movie (that's like compleining about a snake for shedding its own skin), but some scenes didn't have to extent in Taratinoisms.  The bar sequence is a good example, the majority of the sequence has people joking around and playing games before they imitated \\"Resevoir Dogs\\"; plus, the movie already has one clever astute German soldat, having a second clever astute German soldat for this sequence is redundant.  Having long-term conversations is fine and dandy in the Roger Avery era, but they add a lot of build-up, and when the film adds too much build-up, it gnumbs the emotional response of the payoff (something Quentin should learn from his last film).  Still, the film brakes the flow with eclectic brutality plenty of times that it doesn't drag.<br /><br />\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is, if nothing else, a total farse, but whether it's a good or bad thing depends sorly on you.  Do you care that it's historically-raped, tragedy is overshadowed by machismo action, and everyone talks more about films like King Kong than the present sichuation?  No?  Then sit back, grab a popkorn, and expect to laugh and laud with the brutal antics.to work in the director's favor, as there was a lot of down time with characturs exchanging lines before any real action occurs.

1401200605|5.0|Filled with drama, action, thrills, suspense and excitement, it's everything a great Batman story is supposed to be.    Loeb's plot, full of twists and turns and a new villain for Batman to confront, is beautifully illustrated and brought to life by Lee, Williams and Sinclair (an amazing artistic team).     Once again, memories and people from Bruce Wayne's past resurface, threatening to destroy him. The reader is easily pulled in, eager to find out who is behind all the seemingly unconnected events.    This is a great read for any Batman fan, and especially for any Batman & Catwoman fans, as it sets up the plot for Batman: Heart of Hush.
6304936303|5.0|This action comedy thriller from the writer of \\"Lethal Weapon\\" is terrific, but there's one thing I didn't understand. SPOILER WARNING!!! What did Billy Cole have to do with the overall storyline? Also, for what exactly did Hallenback hate Baynard? SPOILERS OVER!!! could somebody please explain that to me? Other than that, I highly enjoyed this action-comedy. I half-expected Bruce Willis to say,<br />\\"Yipee-ca-yay, motherf.....\\" Damon Wayans is pretty good in an action movie. Halle Berry (a rising star at the time) was very good in this movie. I recommend it. Should have been rated PG-13 for strong violence and some language.
B000002B30|5.0|While I came upon \\"The Boss\\" rather late in my life, I discovered I really liked this CD. \\"Born in the USA\\" is one of my particular favorites; in fact, so much so that I play this Greatest Hits CD over and over in my CD player every time I get in my car. Meantime, I'm wondering why TEOTSPRS thinks Bruce Springsteen changed his name from John Cougar Mellencamp.
B00005V9HH|5.0|What can I say about this suspense thriller that hasn't been said before? The twists and turns abound until the final minutes of the movie. \\"And just like that, he's gone.\\" Excellent, tour-de-force performances from everyone. SPOILER WARNING!!! Pay attention to Verbal (Kevin Spacey) in the scene where Kujan (Chazz Palminteri) is yelling at him. SPOILER OVER!!! My only gripe is that Christopher McQuarrie didn't appear in any of the featurettes located on the flip side of the disc (though he briefly appears in the introduction to one of the featurettes). I highly recommend this movie. You'll be surprised. The movie is also very well-written by Christopher McQuarrie and expertly directed by Bryan Singer (both of them would reunite to, respectively, co-write [with Nathan Alexander] and direct \\"Valkyrie\\"; please see my review on that equally excellent movie). This movie should have been rated PG-13 for violence and some language.
B001PR0YBM|5.0|My son CJ is almost 3, and I have been waiting for that *perfect* movie to take him to.  Today, we went to Ponyo.      Ponyo is delightfully drawn.  I had read a review on another site that said it looked \\"old fashioned\\".  Not everything is Pixar; not everything needs to be.  It was nice to see an animated film that was illustrated similarly to animated films of my childhood.      Ponyo held CJ's attention for (almost) the whole movie.  He loved all the fish.  Some elements have the potential to be scary for some children, however (but really, what Disney movie doesn't have scary elements?).    I give it a 5, and CJ says, \\"Ponyo, again?  More movie?\\" so I think he would give it a 5, too!! :)
B000002KK2|4.0|With \\"Chuck E.'s in Love\\" Rickie Lee Jones became an overnight sensation. Although she didn't have any other huge hits from her later albums Jones continues to make terrific music. \\"Pirates\\" the second album is more ambitious and certainly less \\"pop\\" mainstream that the first and, perhaps, on a song-per-song basis a better album but \\"Rickie Lee Jones\\" manages the difficult balancing act of creating radio friendly pop songs and jazz/blues inflected classics.<br /><br />The original Warner CD sounds terrific. Could it be improved? Well maybe. The horns are a bit thin sounding but the ringing tone of acoustic and electric guitars as well as the bass all sound great courtesy of a brilliant original mastering job by engineer Lee Herschberg. For $8 you can't go wrong with this CD as it captures much of the warmth of the original vinyl and the detailed sound as well.<br /><br />The only improvement that I can see is if Audio Fidelity or Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs elected to do this fine album as an SACD similar to \\"Pirates\\" her second album.<br /><br />The CD booklet has the original lyrics and full album credits.
B001FB55H6|5.0|When I saw the theathrical version of this movie in the cinema I was quite pleased with it - but felt some of the scenes didnt gel together the way they should. However, this version of the movie completely solves that problem and, although it is over 3 hours long - it is AWESOME.    Zack Syndar is on a roll with his movies. Keep up the good work.
B001G0MFOM|1.0|I wonder if the writers of this season, knowing that they needed new jobs, took on other tasks to which they directed the majority of their creativity and talent? They certainly didn't put much into finishing what they had started so well, but then the slide didn't start with the last season. The 5th season had moved increasingly toward more sex and less plot. When that had gone as far as it could, it bombed out completely with the unsolved murder mystery of season 6. I think the decline started as far back as season four.<br /><br />After the success of the first three seasons, they increasingly replaced character exploration with plot dependant vignettes.  Characters served the plot no matter how that violated who you thought they were. Events became unpredictable and seemed to exist simply for their shock value. To me, really good writing explores subtle emotions and employs enough foreshadowing to keep the audience thinking. I don't mind being shocked on occasion, but when it happens too often and is accompanied by a bundle of short plotlines, distraction replaces enjoyment.<br /><br />L Word peppered its content with many topics, gender change, promiscuity, breast cancer, military regulations, older women coming out, infidelity and alcoholism. The series covered a lot of serious issues, but often, especially toward the end, placed too many competing issues in one show. Over the last three seasons and especially the last two, I found that the plotlines had fallen to the level of quick, unsatisfying vignettes.<br /><br />In the end what I remember from L Word are caricatures rather than characters and a lot of busy plots. Is it any wonder that its swan song, season six, was a silly murder mystery peppered with flashbacks and completely lacking in substance?
0143038419|2.0|\\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" miraculously (read: unrealistically) combines all unspoken fantasies of middle-aged white women:      1)  Ridding themselves of husbands bound through ill-conceived marriages  2)  Spending extended periods in foreign lands envied by all their (ivariably homogenous cadre of) friends  3)  Gaining, then effortlessly losing, an unapologetic 20 pounds put on from gorging themsevles on carbs  4)  Being flirted with by young, handsome, exotic men who shower them with flattery and beg to gratify them with an endless stream of mind-blowing sex  5)  Assuaging their guilt of privilege by finding some local people to rescue  6)  Finding a second husband who is everything their first husband wasn't--wealthy, gorgeous, doting, fantastic in bed and, of course, latin    Every woman needs her emotional porn, and \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" does well as that.  What it doesn't do is rise to the basic call of a passable story--the meaningful transformation of character.  Gilbert attempts to convince us of how richly she has grown, yet is lacking in a baseline self-awareness that would allow her to approach her travels meaningfully.  Though she grows incrementally, this overall work is pedestrian and unworthy of the admiration it has garnered.
159448385X|5.0|At times this was so grim I had to put it down, skim or just blot it out.  Sadder than the story is that, I presume, it mirrors the reality of this time in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Years ago I read [[ASIN:0316159417 The Bookseller of Kabul]].  Like Rasheed, the Bookseller feels that he is a coveted husband.  Given the poverty and the ability of both these real and fictional men to scrape out a living and the denial of education and employment opportunities for women there is a sad truth to their boasts.  Unfortunately for the happiness of their families and society at large, their values perpetuate the attitudes that keep the country violent and poor.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini, through his portrait of Raheed's relationship with his son and daughter shows how boys develop self importance and dehumanize the women who have no alternative but to sacrifice for them.<br /><br />Besides its depiction of violence to women, the book describes what it was like to live in Kabul through the wider violence of the times. One cannot help but conclude that the warlords, the Taliban and the varied political factions have taken the lessons of their homes into society.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I just can't stop listening to this album.  Just meticulous, melodic and amazingly musical.  Maybe its me just getting older, but while I love Mastodon's older material, the death metal growl just doesn't do it for me anymore.  Crack the Skye is musical through and through.    Each track is a multi layered story, which requires many listens to hear what they have put together. The influences come through...   you can hear everything from classic metal, to thrash, to Holdsworth, to zillions of other small queues drawn from the greats of metal and progressive rock...they're all in there.   The guitar work is so perfect, there are very few thrash passages because the music they are playing is so sophisticated and interwoven, they don't need much in the way of showboating to get the point across.    The vocals are also totally on, with each song having a mood established by the lyrics and vocal tones.   The drums are driving, pounding, grounding, and they never let up...  I still can't stop listening.  The song Quintessence is a great example of how themes, ideas, and musical styles are woven together with amazing musicianship and original writing.    All in all, I enjoy this album immensely.   It is some kind of amazing event, that happens very seldom.  Pagan's Mind and Circus Maximus do this to me also, with hyper complex themes and virtuosic musicianship too.  Bravo Mastodon....
B0000DG00B|5.0|This is a really good album featuring The Allman Bros. Band best linup. Excellent Singing and organ playing from Greg, and very inspired guitar and slide playing from his brother Duane. All around excellent performances from everyone in the band.
0894803123|4.0|Just made the best Butter Pecan from this book with organic eggs, milk, and cream, pure cane sugar, locally grown pecans, and it so soo amazing! Not only that, but the milk is lactose free, so even though the cream is not, we'll have a lot less problems with lactose intolerance.<br /><br />I used the Kitchen-aid mixer ice cream attachment and although it calls for chilling a (presumably cooked) custard for 6 hours prior to using, I just chilled the non-cooked mixture on my fast freeze freezer shelf for about an hour after wisking the ingredients and it froze up just fine.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this book is that it doesn't provide any background about the whole raw egg issue. I don't really have a problem with it because I've read up on it, but others do have concerns and I'd like to have it all there without having to assure others who I may buy the book for.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|I don't normally review stuff but I had to post a rebuttal to the review that stated that this album isn't metal.  Not metal?  Were you expecting death metal?  Black metal?  Just because it isn't dripping with pentagrams doesn't mean it's not metal.  This album is soooo metal.  There are some super heavy riffs that are made even heavier with the few lighter moments.    So yeah, it's not Electric Wizard metal, but it's metal.  And yes, it is very much like Mastodon, and their latest album is half prog and half metal so who gives a crap anyway, it's all good!    Pick up this CD if you dig Kylesa, Torche, Mastodon and maybe even Pelican.  Good stuff!      Say NO to radio!
6302043158|5.0|Previously, I'd only seen this movie when it was a couple of years old, on HBO. I missed the first 40 minutes or so, and a few key scenes during the movie. I have to say that it hit me MUCH more emotionally thirty years later than it did the first time! At fifty, I have more concentration & patience to watch a movie through (or more than once) than I did at 20. For example, I interpreted the ride-to-brighton scene, where Chalky gets run off the road by Rockers differently this time. His \\"friends\\" stop for a few seconds, check him out briefly, then repair to Brighton without even waiting to see if his scooter still works, knowing that the road may be full of Rocker malefactors. The scene shows just how shallow the \\"friendships\\" in this set are. Throughout the movie, Jimmy pursues his goal of becoming a \\"Face\\" (trendsetter,Scene V.I.P) with manic force, but the quest brings him less gratification & more frustration as the story goes on.  First time around, I thought it was very weird for a couple to take a break from a violent riot to have sex in a alley, then re-join the riot. I now realize that to Jimmy, it is the \\"finish line\\" - he naively thinks that he's Got The Girl, the climax (pun intended) of a heroic day. Throughout the movie, Jimmy places great significance upon people & events that really mean nothing to his friends, who simply do whatever feels good whenever they feel like doing it. Steph has 3 boyfriends in the space of about a week, but it doesn't seem to bother anyone, least of all Dave , who seems happy to take his \\"turn\\". He even has the nerve to rib Jimmy about it, and seems genuinely surprised when Jim freaks out. Nothing means very much to these people. In the end he realizes that everything he's been pursuing is a fake: his Dreamgirl is the Neighborhood Slut, his Mod Idol is a lowly Bellboy.  The ending is a direct ripoff of \\"Harold & Maude\\". Harold \\"kills\\" the symbol of his morbid obsessions, Jimmy \\"kills\\" the symbol of his hedonistic lifestyle.And BTW, Jimmy does NOT die-the opening scene shows him walking away from the cliff
1594201927|4.0|Mr. Ferguson is a frequent and one of my favorite guests on Fareed Zakaria's weekly GPS program on CNN.  Because of this, my review is biased as I perceive Mr. Ferguson's intellect and knowledge of the subjects he comments on to be impeccable.    In \\"The Ascent of Money\\", Mr. Ferguson identifies six pillars of the modern financial system, each with monumental events and personalities who provided the impetus for their creation:      1.  Rise of banks/evolution of the banking system  2.  Creation of government bonds in the 13th century  3.  Advent of corporations and the 17th century allowance of equity in corporations (stocks)  4.  18th century insurance and pension funds to facilitate financial protection against risk  5.  19th century more sophisticated instruments of investments; futures, options, derivatives  6.  20th century ownership of residential real estate    Mr. Ferguson postulates economies that combine all of these innovations, allocate capital more efficiently, resulting in higher sustained economic growth.    The hook in Mr. Ferguson's book is \\"Chimerica\\"; The combination of the spectacular expansion of the Chinese economy and savings as a source for the insatiable appetite of U.S. borrowing and consumption.  Mr. Ferguson cautions this intermingling of finances between the two economic leviathans should not be misconstrued as the impetus for lasting peace and security.  \\"One important lesson of history is that major wars can arise even when economic globalization is very far advanced.\\" (p. 330 of hardcover)    Absent from this publication is a prediction of where and when the future financial evolutions will occur, and what solutions lie at the heart of the world financial crisis that began in 2007.  This is understandable as Mr. Ferguson is an historian, and \\"The Ascent of Money\\" is an historical account of the rise and importance of finance, and in that endeavor, Mr. Ferguson delivers the goods.
0375842209|5.0|I won't retell what the book is about. I'm no good at that anyway. Here is what I can say about The Book Thief and that is this:    Usually when I love a book I say \\"This is one of my favorites.\\" I have bundles of them. For The Book Thief I can honestly say \\"This is my favorite.\\" I have never had just one.    The last fifty pages left me sobbing and hiccuping with sorrow but it was all pleasure too, to love a story and a set of characters so much. Any story about WWII that is written with any sort of love is going to be desperate and painful, but I did not know going in how much this book was going to endear itself to me, how much I would love Liesel and Rudy so, and how very sorry I was to see it end. Even Death was as real as any person could be. I cannot give up my copy to anyone, but I plan to make sure as many people I know as possible have a copy of this book to read. It is too important not to share.
0399241523|3.0|Alex Rider is a teen spy who has had enough adventures to last him a lifetime and so he is determined to resign from his job at M16 just as soon as he heals from a near fatal attack.  But like it always has trouble manages to find its way to him.  The night Alex was to be released from the hospital a gang of terroists comes to kidnap his wealthy roommate, Nikoli Drevin, in an attempt to blackmail and stop his father from continuing his building of a space hotel.  Alex does the only thing he sees is right and rescues Nikoli from his undesirable fate only to be caught himself.  As always he wiggles out of the situation and manages to make it back home safely where he receives an invitation to stay with the Drevins. Unwillingly Alex agrees to it and soon he is told that he must spy on Mr. Drevin because the CIA and M16 suspect him of foul play.  And so again Alex Rider embarks on a dangerous undercover mission.  This book is full of action and suspense but unlike in the last ones I don't feel on the edge as much.  The plot is a little lack luster and I feel as though Horowitz wrote this one without much thought, although it does throw in a surprise twist that you have to read almost 300 pages to discover.  Overall I expected a better effort by Horowitz but still a decent book.  Not one of his best novels, but still interesting enough.    Grade: B-

0312370849|5.0|First off, I never knew that about the French, that there were Jews deported off to Auschwitz. I never knew that about the French policemen separating the mothers from their children or the passive onlookers who just watched their fellow human beings being marched off to their deaths. This story amazed me as the author combined two stories into one ... tying the threads of what happened on July 16, 1942 and a present-day American journalist, who had to face difficult decisions of her own.     This novel is based on the events that happened one hot summer day. Policemen were searching houses in the middle of the night, yanking innocent men and women and children out of bed and sending them off to a fate that no one dared to believe in. Sarah was a young girl who locked her brother into their closet so he would be safe. This is Sarah's story of how she went on that horrible march in town to the trains to be carried to the concentration camps just outside of Paris. This is Sarah's story of how she watched women and children and men face the most humilating circumstances alive, being treated worse than animals at Vel' d'Hiv', what used to be the stadium in Paris until it was torn down in 1958. Then they were sent off to a concentration camp where soon, the mothers were wrenched away from their children's arms (that part was probably the most realistically described part of the story ... still gives me the shivers!) and the mothers were sent to Auschwitz. This is about Sarah's escape from the prison camp to return home to save her little brother.     Not only is it Sarah's story, it is Julia's story. Julia is a transplanted American who married a Frenchman, and Julia is a journalist. Julia's husband's grandmother was sent to a nursing home and in the course of her research on the La Grande Rafle (the round-up of the Jews), Julia found out that her new apartment, that was Mame's, was also Sarah's home. Obessed with finding Sarah, Julia had to come to terms with her own life, marriage and beliefs.     The author traveled back and forth from Sarah's story to Julia's story ... and made it a mystery that is also full of historical facts. This novel kept me turning the page after page while holding my breath. It felt more like a memoir than a novel, with two different voices chiming in on their thoughts and concerns and fears. Yes, there were tears shed on my part. I couldn't help it as De Rosnay is an excellent writer with great visual cues in describing some of the most horrorific scenes to happen in humankind. I was slightly disappointed with the section of 2002 to 2005 as it seems to be a little bit off especially after such an intense first three quarters of the book. And this book is intense. Everything about this book is intense. I would not recommend reading this book before bed as it might be nerve-wracking with all of its descriptions of the concentration camps and the grief that is evident throughout the entire book.     If you like historical fiction, then you will like this book. This is one that I will definitely recommend to my book club and to other avid readers. It is just that intense, thought-provoking and like Sarah said in a letter, \\"Never forget.\\"    8/21/09
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|After allowing the film to settle in, I chose to give it the Amazon three star rating, meaning the film was OK. Apparently, Tarantino had spent close to a decade developing the script, hoping it would become his \\"crowning glory\\". He used \\"Guns of Navarone\\", \\"The Dirty Dozen\\", and other war movies and spaghetti westerns as his inspiration. Despite \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" being to some degree entertaining, I believe Tarantino failed to create the masterpiece for which he had hoped.<br /><br />Unlike what previews suggest, the film is NOT about the team of \\"Inglorious Bastards\\", Jewish GI's who scalp their way thru German ranks in occupied France, wreaking havoc and demoralizing German soldiers. In fact, we learn little about the individual members of the pack. Brad Pitt's screen time as their boss, southern redneck Lt Aldo Raine, is limited. The Basterds Team are simply one of the building blocks of a story arc in which Tarantino gets to rewrite WWII history. The incredulous end that the writer dishes out to Hitler makes it obvious \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is NOT a war film, but rather a Tarantino version of one. The typical \\"Tarantino\\" violence is there, of course, even though, oddly, it does not disturb as much. After all, the real violence of WWII was far worse, making the film appear almost restrained.<br /><br />I would say the biggest sin of the film is in its editing. At 2.5 hours long (not including previews), you have to wonder about the wisdom of treating viewers to a long scene involving cream being scooped out onto strudel... It looked yummy, and made me want to leave the theater immediately and head to the local bakery for a slice of Vienna Tort... but did nothing to further the action.<br /><br />The shining star of the film is undoubtedly Christoph Waltz, an Austrian actor with a career spanning over three decades, as the brilliant, sociopathic and at least a little mad Col. Hans Landa. He steals every scene he is in (whether speaking English, German, French or Italian) and, in my opinion, makes the film. There are rumours of an Oscar nomination. He deserves one. Apparently, the role had almost gone to Leonardo DeCaprio. I cannot even imagine the loss this would have meant for the film... Mr Waltz makes \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" worth seeing.<br /><br />Before you do, please be ready to read subtitles. At least 50% of the dialogue is subtitled due to vast slabs of it being in German, French and Italian (we get to hear Diane Kruger speaking her native tongue). This is not another \\"Pulp Fiction\\" or \\"Reservoire Dogs\\", but... the story entertains nonetheless. Just not as much.n my opinion, makes the film. There are rumours of an Oscar nomination.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|I loved seeing this one again. It is a classic especially now that Hugh Lawrey is a star on TV and Stephen Fry is gone.  The subtlety of Jeeves expressions is just like in the books. I wish they had made more. I have read many Wodehouse books and hope they pick more to produce.
0399226907|5.0|One Sunday morning a caterpillar hatches from an egg and eats his way through the week, each day eating one more item than the day before.  The following Sunday he spins a cocoon and goes to sleep, waking as a beautiful butterfly.  This wonderful book has a lot going for it: It utilizes the days of the week, counts from one to five, names a number of familiar foods, and traces the life cycle of a caterpillar.  It also incorporates a charming humor when on Saturday, the caterpillar eats many foods beloved by small children (but not by caterpillars), and develops a stomachache.  There is also a tactile element for younger readers, because as the caterpillar eats through each food he leaves a hole in the page, which is a cutaway revealing additional foods to come on the next day.  The plot is simple enough to hold the attention of the toddlers for whom it is intended, while providing enough complexity to last longer than most toddler stories.  It's brightly illustrated in Carle's inimitable collage style.<br /><br />Because of its immense popularity, the book has appeared in many editions -- including board book, paperback, foam book, and pop-up.  Since the 0-4 age is very rough on books, I recommend the sturdier versions.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|First off I am a unbelievably huge fan of the show, and I am happy how they did the packaging (4 discs in a standard size DVD case), and the extras are definitely above average, and here is where I ran into something..when you open the case on the inside of the sleeve they put episode listing per discs and what extras appear where. Look at episode 12 The Sleep Of Babies, it clearly indicates a commentary track is available, but the option appears nowhere on the disc, and yes I tried manually adjusting the audio tracks to see if it was somehow hidden..and nothing. So more or less I am wondering is it just a mistake in the reverse side cover print, or a big screw such as completely forgetting to insert it into the DVD. I am sure this will not matter to most folks, but like I said I am a big fan and if there is another commentary track available I would sure like to have it. If anyone come across some info on this it would sure be appreciated.  Thanks

I loved the blues influences of I and II and except for When The Levee Breaks they kind of went away from that on later albums so it was good to hear some discarded blues stuff on Coda. Coda is not the perfect swan song for the band but it to my mind it does a far better job than ITTOD. This really is a good album if you are a blues fan.

The issue is supernatural transformation FROM sin [fallen, biased and debased for transgressions] TO resurrection: God's perfect    re-creation.     It's NOT the superimposed superficiality of PC scientism [pseudo-science fiction]: Devolution of the Revolution FROM God.     The subtitle of Darwin's own book is \\"The Preservation of Favoured Races [arrogant PC elitism now?] in the Struggle for Life\\"....IN time, that is, VS. FOR eternity.     Or, how about Spiritual fallen a.k.a. dumbed-down as deceived devolving Darwin-to-Dawkins [400+ pages now!] and Occam's Razor: the principle that when you have two competing theories or realities that make predictions [mindless evolution to soulless, sinless personal \\"extinction\\" VS mindfull creation AND re-creation] the simpler one is the better.     Thus: Christ, Re-/Creator Artist > Super CON Artist, to Antichrist. Do people think that evil [and sin] is not real and there is no [counter]intelligence behind it? Dumbed-down DUH!    Former atheist Anthony Flew  saw the light and \\"flew\\" this blinding darkness `n lite THEORY [I.E. SPECULATION]. Science and technology [such as the supernatural cross]  is about principles. There is no philosophical  nor \\"religious\\" dimension to reality, including evolution [origin: fluke matter,  meaning: demeaning, destiny: extinction]. There is a small-s spirit [in/of the mind] vs. Spirit war!     There should be a dumbed-down [AS FALLEN] deceived Darwin-to-Dawkins  midway show [cue the calliope music] selling this PC SCIENTISM pap.    Some  lines:  See matter come ALIVE!!!!!  See the single cell morph into a whale: JUST GIVE IT TIME!!!!!  Mind FROM matter, NOT Master mind OVER matter: SOOOO SMART!!!!   Reductionism NOT metamorphosis!!!  The Earth: a FLUKE!!!    Evolution is Devolution: to societal insanity.       The Spiritual and emotional ignorance and constipation vs HIS E-motive [eternity] is mind-boggling. How can SO many be SOdeceived? 1000+ rate it an average of 4+ stars. They are CONformed [CON artist] not transformed.     Christ is THE star: Christ's ability > GULLIBILITY.    If the best and brightest are in Washington DC and our universities why are we moving to moral, political and financial implosion? Academia is PC-retarded and unwilling to be transformed: to grow UP. I know as I worked at a university and learned more as a critical observer than I ever did as a student there.

0517255464|5.0|I am largely self taught though I attend a weekly figure drawing group. I use figure drawing books in lieu of an  drawing instructor.  I find that Bridgman is referenced in most other figure drawing books that I have read.         I am happy that I now own what I consider the source of figure drawing books. The soft pencil drawings are elegant and rhythmic.  The lack of detail in hands and faces is at once exemplary and frustrating. I want to see more detail but am shown, by his examples,that the suggestion is often the key to successful drawing.     I find the explanation of drawing some body parts, the human head, for example, to be impossible to understand.  But I got the book for the number of elegant drawings on almost every page. The drawings are the reason why this remains a classic figure drawing book.

B001AQMBNC|5.0|... boy, does it ever!  This film has been a favorite of mine from the beginning, and the only reason I am reviewing it here is because of the tepid reviews from HiDefDigest (and some others).  I ordered my copy in spite of that, and lo and behold, a real gem of a transfer!  The colors are beautiful with natural skin tones, and some snappy reds, like Starman's baseball cap. Quite often this film looks three dimensional, a good example is the scene with Karen Allen and Jeff Bridges in the back of a truck with a beautiful Arizona blue sky behind them.  The sound is terrific with both side and back surrounds active when required (HDD thinks they are just random, whatever that means!) and the LFE cranks up for spacecraft landings and helicopter flybys!  One of the clowns at HDD says this disk is for rental only; makes me wonder what kind of equipment they use over there.  So, if you like this movie and want a good Blu-ray copy, then go for it!

B000002IOY|5.0|The Years of Decay is Overkill's fourth official outing, following on the heels of Under the Influence. Originally Released in 1989, this album is probably Overkill's best release, with it's closest competitors being Horrorscope and Feel the Fire.     Anyway, if you read the previous paragraph or looked at how many stars were a'glowing above, then you know that I really, really, REALLY like this album. Need more detail? Fine....      This album begins with Time to Kill, a nice little ditty driven by a kickass riff and badass vocals. The album follows with Elimination - probably their most popular song (when I saw these guys live I heard more requests for this song than anything else) - and it continues to kick said ass all throughout the albums running time. I Hate is a great song to listen to when you feel like strongly disliking someone, Nothing to Die contains a nice structure that seems to be Bass-driven. And don't even ask me to list out the badassery of the song Playing with Spiders/SkullKrusher; I just don't have the capacity within this review.     Anyway, the album is absolute perfect thrash start to finish, with one exception. The only song I felt was weak was, strangely enough, the title track. It's mostly clean acoustic work, and it is more of a ballad then anything else. The song itself is simply too long and too boring to me. I don't mind variety at all, but this particular song just doesn't do a good job of changing the mood.     Besides that small detour, The Years of Decay is one of those records that makes you think when you hear it. I feel this is the kind of music Oppenheimer would have listened to if he were still alive or if Thrash Metal existed in the early forties during the Manhattan Project. Pathetic attempts at humor aside, this album is awesome. Buy it. Now. Even if you already have it.

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|Someday, Pixar is going to do it -- they're going to create an emotionally uninspiring, lackluster animated movie. But in the meantime, they're still putting out delightful animated movies like \\"Up,\\" which defies the usual kid-movie conventions by starring a crotchety old man. It's a charming, fun little adventure story with flying dogs and balloon-powered houses, but underlying it is a bittersweet little story about loss and love.<br /><br />As a child, the shy Carl Fredricksen bonded with the oddball Ellie over their shared love of adventure, the explorer Charles Muntz, and Paradise Falls. They later married, move into their \\"clubhouse\\" together, and lived a long, sadly childless life together. When Ellie died, she had never fulfilled her dream of going to Paradise Falls.<br /><br />Now crotchety, alone and harassed by a real estate developer, Carl (Ed Asner) is finally ordered to a retirement home. But he isn't going quietly -- instead he attaches thousands of balloons to his house and floats it away toward South America. But he accidentally takes an enthusiastic, naive Wilderness Explorer (a thinly-veiled Boy Scout) named Russell (Jordan Nagai) along for the ride. Poor kid was just trying to earn an \\"assisting the elderly\\" badge.<br /><br />And the jungle trek to Paradise Falls turns out to have some surprising obstacles: a big emulike bird that Russell names Kevin, a talking dog named Dug (\\"I am jumping on you, bird!\\"), and a mysterious old man who lives deep in the heart of the jungle. Turns out the old guy is very familiar to Carl -- and to capture Kevin, he's willing to sacrifice Carl and Russell.<br /><br />Industry experts were babbling about how \\"Up\\" wouldn't be as popular as the previous Pixar movies, because the protagonist is basically a crusty old coot. Well, shows what they know. It ended up becoming one of those classic movies that somehow appeals to all ages -- while the humor and action appeal to children, adults can appreciate Carl's love for his lost wife, and his slow realization that he's clinging to the past.<br /><br />In fact, the first ten minutes are some of the most heart-tugging, quietly bittersweet scenes I've seen in a long time. Without a word, they show all the ups and downs of a realistic marriage -- joys, sorrows (Ellie's inability to have children), growing old together, and finally loss.<br /><br />But it's not a depressing movie by any stretch -- in fact, it's like a childhood fantasy come to life, complete with a floating house suspended on hundreds of balloons, and biplanes piloted by a talking dog army.. Plenty of great dialogue (\\"Do you want to play a game? It's called See Who Can Go the Longest Without Saying Anything.\\" \\"Cool! My mom loves that game!\\") and an action-packed climax in an aged airship.<br /><br />Ed Asner is absolutely perfect as ubergrouch Carl -- crotchety, grumpy, and determined to fulfill his wife's lifelong dream, but gradually realizing he's clinging to the past. Nagai is equally perfect as Carl's polar opposite: a naive, chattery Scout who is determined to reunite Kevin with her baby chicks. And the utterly adorable Dug and the other dogs deserve special notice. These creatures are utterly hilarious -- they talk (\\"I hid under your porch because I love you\\") and act the way dogs would if they talked. Three words: cone of shame.<br /><br />The two-disc edition is going to have some very nice extras, but once again people with regular-def DVDs are going to get shafted because the Blu-ray edition will have a bunch of exclusive stuff. Grr. As for this one, there's a digital copy, the director's audio commentary, kinda-alternate-ending \\"The Many Endings of Muntz,\\" and the documentary \\"Adventure Is Out There\\" about the research for this movie.<br /><br />There are also a pair of adorable animated shorts. \\"Partly Cloudy\\" has a much-abused stork having to deliver potentially harmful baby creatures from a kind but clueless cloud. And \\"Dug's Special Mission\\" is a sort of backstory for the adorable Dug, explaining what the heck he was doing before he met up with Carl and Russell.<br /><br />\\"Up\\" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy. With that, I have only one more thing to say... SQUIRREL!oing before he met up with Carl and Russell.     \\"Up\\" continues Pixar's running tally of gloriously animated, emotionally layered movies that the entire family can enjoy.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|My big complaint about the Quinny Zapp was that the basket was small and difficult to access when the child is in the stroller.  This stroller accessory fits perfectly between the handles of the stroller, and is the perfect size to hold keys, cell phone, small drinks, and make them easily accessible, without weighing down the top of the stroller.
B0015ABRE2|3.0|The show is awesome. Watched the entire thing in two nights. My problem is whoever made the DVD messed up the chapters.

Why mess up something so trivial?

0545123267|2.0|Vampires, as charming and alluring as they are, have nothing on werewolves for me. I enjoy the idea of transformation and find the blending of human and animal qualities entrancing. So it pains me to say that the initial storyline for this novel gave me the creeps.<br /><br />The brief summary is: Grace Brisbane survived a wolf attack when she was 11 and ended up bonding with one of them, a yellow-eyed animal who saves her from his pack. This starts an initial obsession with the pack who lives in the woods behind her house, particularly with the yellow-eyed wolf she calls \\"hers.\\" In truth, her wolf is actually a boy named Sam, who becomes her silent guardian. He can only change from human to animal in relation to the weather (warmer climate makes him human, winter climate makes him wolf.) Under unusual circumstances, however, he manages to become human during the winter and the two fall even more in love. It's a matter of fighting the temperature to keep the two together. The story is told from both Sam and Grace's points of view.<br /><br />Being an animal lover myself, I can understand Grace's fascination with the wolves. But what made me uneasy was the way she fell In Love with Sam while he was a wolf. Perhaps it was the wording of Grace's point of view but it just felt disturbing, like she would have abandoned any idea of a human counterpart so she could be with him. In a sense she does, because her friend Olivia's older brother obviously cares a lot for her and she doesn't even acknowledge him. The older brother then disappears (not out of the story, but from the book) so we can see more of the couple's struggles.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are too cute of a couple. Everything about them is perfect. No real arguments or disagreements come between them; any that do are quickly remedied. Only perfect love and completion exist for them. He marvels at her beauty and his desire for her. She marvels at his good looks and intelligence. He even stays in their house the entire time he's with her because her parents are never around, and writes corny love songs for her. There was even a time when she revealed her obsession with him, and he responds with a smile. Aside from the fact that she's young and the temperature is against them, it's no wonder she makes him her entire world, and vice versa. The fact that wolves mate for life is emphasized at the end, which I actually enjoyed, because even though I am still trying to stomach the syrupy sweetness of their relationship, inside I'm a romantic. But it wasn't enough to save what could have been an amazing love story. Werewolves are still my mainstay, I just hope something like this doesn't happen again.er because her parents are never around, and writes corny love songs for her.

B0002VL0KQ|4.0|Celine Dion's 'Miracle,' which was released in October 2004 and created in collaboration with baby photographer Anne Geddes, is a largely 'classical crossover'-like album that's meant to convey the feelings of parents and their children. Although the style isn't what you've come to expect from Ms. Dion, it's not as bad as some people might think.    Some of the songs bring emotion and life to the notion of motherhood and baby. The title track is one of the best examples of this: With lyrics such as 'You're my life's one miracle...Who could ever love you more,' it gives me the feeling of unconditional love exchanged between parents and children, and vice versa. Her solo re-recording of 'The Prayer,' renamed 'A Mother's Prayer,' is much sadder than the duet version with Andrea Bocelli from the 1998 'Quest for Camelot' motion picture, but it shows that Ms. Dion could bring heartfelt emotion in such a way that you'll want to cry and hug your parents, children, or any family members closest to you (it worked for me).    The rest of the album works well, but one or two songs on the album aren't as good as the others, which explains why I took off one star. Otherwise, 'Miracle' is a delicate collection of songs designed specifically for parents AND babies, or anyone who agrees with what Ms. Geddes (she did a superb job on the photography) said: 'Each new life is truly a miracle.' And you don't have to have had a child to enjoy it (I have no children myself).
015603283X|5.0|No one seems to mention - though it is hinted at by referencing Umberto Eco - that this is a great postmodernist novel.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Sicko opens with an uninsured man suturing his own leg.  Another revels in an interview, that he was asked at the hospital, which one of his fingers he wanted to have re-attached, since he could not afford both. Most of the movie is about people who are insured but were denied payment of their medical bills by their insurance company.  Failure to declare any previous medical condition at the time of obtaining insurance can for some people mean denial of a medical claim once one is filed.  For some, the co-payments can become too burdensome.  The film ends with a twist of irony, when a boatload of Americans flee to Cuba for affordable medical treatment and prescriptions.  One of them even gets a corrected diagnosis from a doctor there.  The health care systems of other countries are explored.  This DVD includes bonus material where Michael Moore defends himself from his detractors after the film's original release.<br /><br />A hundred and one years before Sicko, Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\" was published.  Sinclair was a socialist and The Jungle was a socialist novel.  It is a socialist novel which was factual enough to move President Theodore Roosevelt and Congress to enact new laws which led to the creation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Sinclair hoped for labor reform.  That took much longer to enact than regulations regarding things which most people ingest. The federal government would fund the FDA and its' predecessor rather than requiring the food industry to supply the funding as Sinclair wanted.<br /><br />Some health care reform will be enacted and one day Sicko will be as historically important as \\"The Jungle\\". Perhaps there should be a federal sales tax on the purchase of TV network advertising time, since most of that seems to be bought by pharmaceutical and insurance companies.  We don't need to have the same health care system as any other nation.  The point to be made is we should do better.

Mr. Buble is an amazing performer, and adding comedy into his show to enhance his incredible talent makes this one of the best live performances I have ever watched! The song selection is perfect and the guest appearances on the film make it that much more entertaining. The DVD quality is excellent and the camera recording him and the band truly make you feel as if you are a part of the show.  I just can't say enough!  You must experience the DVD concert until you have the opportunity to see him live.  I'm truly blown away!

Great flick, great story...loved every minute.

Blu-ray picture detail and sound are excellent; these provide such an improvement over the DVD version that you will think those alien ships are really out there. The convincingly simulated destruction and violence could be scary for the very young, but we earthlings triumph in the end. Just enough romance to keep the ladies interested, and a pleasing emphasis on family values.

1567184855|3.0|For some reason I wasn't as impressed with the book.  I ended up passing it along to family members and they seem to be getting more out of it.  I didn't follow the author as well as they did.  I didn't enjoy reading, and chose not to continue, with the chapter about disturbed souls.  The book stopped intriguing me about the subject of passed lives when the stories stopped and started and the wording got too \\"clinical\\" sounding.  If you are familiar with this topic it may be interesting to you. For a \\"newbie\\" like me into this subject I found it unattractive and uncomfortable.
B00204AA0O|5.0|Every track on this CD is amazing. Every song is fresh and new -- Regina never replicates herself.

0788812807|5.0|One of the best movies Disney has ever made. Good for even toddlers; only one scary bit where Tramp chases off some mean dogs (lots of growling). There is a worrisome moment at the end with Trusty, but all ends well. Actually, there's a lot of possibilities for discussion with kids in this movie! Social class, manners, assumptions, when is it okay to bend the rules, when isn't it, etc. GREAT songs, too!
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I really dig this Enigma album because Michael Cretu doesn't spend a lot of time singing lead vocals, it's mostly instrumental although he does sign lead vocal on some tracks.  While he's a great musician and arranger/recorder his strong point is not his vocals unfortunately. This album rocks more than any other Enigma album and most of the tracks have a great bass line that will sure to get you grooving and give your speakers a work out.
0195067142|5.0|This is a painfully honest account of the agony, fear, and overall misery that the infantry experience in any war.  In telling the history of the Peleliu and Okinawa campaigns of WWII from the grunt's perspective, E. B. Sledge recounts how the brutality of war erodes the moral standards of both friends and enemies.  He does not preach; he simply observes with regret.<br /><br />His book is particularly timely with the US having a large number of battle weary troops returning home from war.  The adjustment back to civilian life takes time and understanding.  The service member who comes home is not the same person who shipped out a year or two earlier.

B001TODCII|4.0|My husband picked this up for rent and we were both pleased with the selection.  We both like Liam Neeson and we thought he delivered a good performance in Taken.  We were both a little annoyed with how the daughter and mom asked him for the Paris trip.  My husband and I both thought we'd never let one of our daughters (at 17) go to Paris with just another friend.  But, a story was needed.  We thought it was fast paced with a lot of action.  We were always on the edge of our seat.  Realistic?  I sure hope not, but it makes you wonder by the end of the movie.  Four stars because I can't see myself purchasing it and watching countless times.  But my husband and I both liked it!

B000YABIQ6|3.0|To me Mad Men is disappointing, mostly because it could've, it should've been much better. Yes, some of the writing is very good, and I certainly felt I was in a 1960's ad agency. And yes, some of the women characters are interesting and sympathetic; but the main problem I have with the series is that the men are, for the most part, despicable. I don't know how else to say it. I simply don't care about them. In fact, I don't like them. True, Dan Draper becomes slightly more sympathetic towards the end of the first season, so it will be interesting to see what direction the writers will go.

Also, the big surprise twist at the end was a surprise chiefly because it was utterly, ludicrously non-credible.    Don't waste your time. Go read Patrick O'Brian instead. It will be much, much harder going -- and it will be much, much more rewarding.

Twists and turns as expected with Rollins and a fair share of blood and guts as well. those you trust the most will be the ones who betray, as an added touch of spice. The scarry thing about all this, is that most of it is, or can be, fact. Things we may have not given notice to in our day to day lives may ultimately result in our total extinction.

1607514311|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the very best books I've ever read and I've read many. With artful analogies to wending one's way through all of life's pitfalls successfully, the author has woven an unforgetable story narrated by an unforgetable dog. You will laugh outloud. You will cry outloud. The story is exceptionally well written, and this book will always linger in your mind and in your heart. Accolades to the author, Garth Stein. I had never heard of him before, but I WILL find his other books. Several of my friends have read this book based on my recommendation, and all of them feel as I do. Filled with values, life lessons, family, belief systems and the conflicts that we all have. Don't miss this one. Sue Flannery

1932100660|5.0|This is NOT a diet book, it's a book written to inform the public about nutrition and the role politics plays in what you choose to put in your mouth, as well as the health implications of what you eat.  I found myself angry by the time I finished this book--once again, The Almighty Dollar takes center stage as the reason why Americans are so misinformed about what to eat. As a vegan, I am intimately familiar with the eye-rolling and glazed expression I often get when I (by necessity) find myself explaining why I won't eat meat or butter, or drink milk.  It has nothing to do with animal rights--although I do happily count myself OUT as one of the people who unknowingly support such cruelty--but rather a realization that it's a healthier way to live.  Dr. Campbell provides plenty of scientific evidence to support a mostly plant-based diet (emphasis on mostly), and does so with a wonderfully human touch.  He describes his own upbringing, his very American way of eating as a child, and his initial astonishment and disbelief at what he comes to learn as he researches the impact of nutrition on overall health. I challenge ANYONE to read The China Study and NOT be angered at the way money, greed and special-interest groups control so much of our lives.  Even if you have no particular interest in changing your diet or your lifestyle, this book will affect you.
0142406112|4.0|Totally entertaining for the youth market, especially for the reluctant male reader. The adventures that 14-yr-old Alex Rider gets into - and out of - are wildly unbelievable, yet one keeps reading just to see what could happen next! First in a series of Alex Rider stories. (No offensive language; has violence that mostly happens peripherally.)    Note: For boys who wonder how British Intelligence could build such spy gadgets for Alex, Horowitz has written a neat book with blueprints and descriptions of the gadgets he used in books 1-5. [[ASIN:0399244867 Alex Rider: The Gadgets (Alex Rider Adventure)]] Very cool.  The boys pore over this book.

B00070DK14|5.0|\\"Raise it up - say Cheerio\\" - thus ends the original release of Jethro Tull's \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\", one of the groups best albums, though long overlooked in the U.S.  The remastered version of the album though, doesn't end there and instead carries on for eight additional bonus tracks and nearly 30 minutes of additional music.  Bonus tracks can be a blessing or a curse, and one can find examples of each type within those included here, but as long as one can program their CD playback they are usually appreciated even if they are only listened to on rare occasions.    The original album is one of Tull's best, up there with the likes of any of the numerous ones which are often mentioned as being their best.  From each of the albums two near-title tracks to the paranoid \\"Watching Me Watching You\\" to the closing toast \\"Cheerio\\", it is full of strong and very listenable tracks.  No doubt some have gone in and out of my personal favor at times, but each one has something which draws the listener in and all have those wonderful lyrics which make them uniquely Ian Anderson's.    The album opens with \\"Beastie\\", one of those near-title tracks and a song about people's private fears summed up nicely in the lyric:    \\"If you wear a warmer sporran, you can keep the foe at bay.  You can pop those pills and visit some psychiatrist who'll say:  There is nothing I can do for you, every where's a danger zone.  I'd love to help get rid of it, but I've got one of my own.\\"    This is followed by \\"The Clasp\\", a song about the ritual of shaking hands, or more accurately about those who are afraid to do so.  Next is the delightful \\"Fallen On Hard Times\\", a song for all times really which discusses people's mistrust of politicians and the political process, i.e. \\"come clean for once and hit us with the truth.\\"  \\"Flying Colors\\" deals with ex-lovers who seem to take pleasure in showing off their disagreements in public.  \\"Slow Marching Band\\" closes the first half of the album with a song about people who are parting ways.    The second half of the album opens with the other near-title track \\"Broadsword\\", a nice historical number which brings images to the listener's mind of defending against a Viking attack, or more generally can be about any man protecting his family.  \\"Pussy Willow\\" is a song about a young woman who is more excited by her fantasy world than she is her real life.  \\"Watching Me Watching You\\" has a completely different musical feel than most of the album, and seems to be a song about the fear of people watching you, or perhaps just the feeling that you are being watched.  \\"Seal Driver\\" has a rather unusual lyric and one has to wonder if it is about a ship or a woman, which plays off of the switch between women and trains which takes place in the lyric of the previous number.  The album then closes with the short \\"Cheerio\\", which is the perfect end to a wonderful album.    The bonus tracks open with \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow\\", a number which is as strong as the original album, and another of Tull's wonderful Christmas songs in which he so rudely reminds us of the less fortunate instead of the marketing and greed which so often dominates people's thoughts during the holiday season.  Next is the wonderful \\"Jack A Lynn\\", and the lamenting of being away from one you love.  \\"Mayhem Maybe\\" is a song from the point of view of fairy-folk and has a nice acoustic sound to it.  \\"Too Many Too\\" is one of the weaker songs added in, though even a weaker Ian Anderson song still has something to offer.  \\"Overhang\\" is a solid number, with all the trappings of a Tull number, strong guitar, strong flute, and intriguing lyrics.  \\"Rhythm in Gold\\" lyrically would probably fit better on \\"Under Wraps\\", but musically it fits well here, though is not up to the level of the songs on the original album.  \\"I Am Your Gun\\" is another of the weaker tracks, though certainly interesting as it is written from the point of a gun.  \\"Down At the End of Your Road\\" is one of the better bonus tracks, with a humorous lyric and an overall unique feel when compared to the other tracks.    This album had a different lineup for Tull as only Ian Anderson (flute, acoustic guitar, vocals), Martin Barre (electric guitar, acoustic guitar), and Dave Pegg (bass, mandolins, vocals) return from the previous release.  The new-comers include Gerry Conway (drums, percussion) who replaced Mark Craney and Peter-John Vettesse (piano, synthesizers) who replaced Eddie Jobson.
0316017922|5.0|An outlier is a statistical observation that is markedly<br />different in value from the others in the sample.<br />  In 'Outliers' Malcolm Gladwell looks at Hockey players,<br />software billionaires, Manhattan lawyers, Jamaicans,<br />Koreans and many others and argues convincingly that<br />noone ever makes it alone to the top.<br />  Where we're from matters, always - according to Gladwell.<br /><br />  Take health. The conventional wisdom used to be that health<br />depends to a great extend on ourselves - our genes.<br />On our decisions - what we choose to eat, how we exercise,<br />what medical services are available to us.<br />Then came the Stewart Wolf study of the small city of Roseto<br />in Pennsylvania. A city where it was common for<br />many generations to live together under the same<br />roof, a city of no alcoholism, no drug addiction, and very little crime,<br />all in a protective social structure insulating citizens from the pressures<br />of the modern world. The result - improved health. Health<br />that came from the society surrounding the individual.<br /><br />  A story that sets the stage for Gladwells other<br />stories about success - success that depends on where we are from and<br />who we are to begin with.<br /><br />  ---<br /><br />  1975 was the dawn of the personal computer age.<br />That was when the first personal computers made it to<br />mainstream society. Gladwell mentions the $397 Altair 8800<br />on the cover of popular electronics in January 1975.<br />  Who was then in a position to take advantage of this?<br />If you were too old in 1975 you already had a job<br />working with mainframes and were probably not that<br />interested in doing something new (and risky). So we can<br />rule out all those born before say 1952 ... And you couldn't<br />be to young either. Not surprisingly<br />Bill Gates (55), Paul Allen (53) and Steve Balmer (56) clocks<br />the precise right age. Along with Steve Jobs (55), Eric Schmidt (55)<br />etc.<br />  That they eventually win the game comes down to<br />practice (before anyone else has it) -<br />a  community that gives them the opportunity<br />to put in the 10.000 hours of practice that it takes<br />to become good at anything. A nearby university that allows<br />Bill G. to work with computers at an early age (and give<br />him more practice time under his belt than competitors).<br />  Sure intelligence is important - but only up to a point -<br />If you have I.Q. above a certain threshold, having more I.Q.<br />wont make you more successful. What matters then is how well<br />you do a divergence tests.  In divergence tests, there<br />isn't a simple right answer - but it is all about where you can go<br />with what you have - a word, an image. In short imagination.<br />  In an old Califonia study kids are I.Q. tested, and the results<br />are compared with their position in life later on. The brightest<br />(I.Q. wise) kids don't end up all that well, and the study doesn't pick out<br />the kids who eventually becomes nobel laureates. The divergence<br />part is missing.<br />  To make it and be a success you need to be \\"streetclever\\" as well.<br />Take Oppenheimer. Robert Oppenheimer was appointed to scientific director of<br />the Manhattan project.  He doesnt know anything about<br />equipment, is very impractical - and worse still -in graduate<br />school he tried to kill his tutor. Thats not good on a C.V.<br />Here you need practical intelligence to talk your case to<br />others and get what you want. Obviously, Oppenheimer was<br />good at this also. And gets the job - ahead of brighter and better people?!<br /><br />  Gladwells message is clear enough. Intelligence is<br />relevant only up to a point. Then you need hard work and<br />opportunity. Where hard work is a prison sentence only<br />if has no meaning.<br />  Different cultures have different ideas<br />about hard work. And how meaningful it is.<br />Kalahari bushmen works 1000 hours a year,<br />and hasnt taken to agriculture as there are still plenty of<br />mongongo nuts in their world. Peasants in Europe<br />worked 1200 hours a year, much in the summer, little in the winter.<br />Rice field workers in China worked 3000 hours a year.<br />Gladwell argues that this work morale is what<br />benefits students doing science and math today. Simply - more work.<br />And not a problem if is considered meaningful work. If the<br />culture says it is meaningful.<br />  The garmant industry in New York around 1900 was another<br />place of hard work - where east european jews could use<br />their skills in the modern world.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|As an admirer of Jane Austen novels, I ordered this video because it was the only version of Pride and Prejudice that I could find with a Spanish soundtrack--and it did serve that purpose. The rendition of Jane Austen's novel, however, was very disappointing. I have viewed many video versions of Pride and Prejudice and have found one to excel far above the rest in accurately depicting the book. That is the BBC production starring Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which adheres very closely to Austen's original text. In the BBC version, the settings are authentic and realistic for the era, and the casting is excellent. For anyone who has read and enjoyed the novel Pride and Prejudice, I highly recommend the BBC video. Elizabeth Garvie becomes Elizabeth Bennett.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|A return to respectability for Meryl Streep. (I didn't care for her musical)  This is a slow, character driven piece that I was totally head faked into believing that Streep was the unreasonable one.  I agree with one reviewer that there are no real good characters here--except perhaps for the little boy.  But then again, we see nothing through his eyes.  I like Amy Adams but she felt more like wallpaper in this piece.  To me, Hoffman didn't bring his A game--but Meryl is the master of the game.  It's a good solid movie.
B0006J28BO|4.0|With 'Spirited Away' taking the oscar in 2001 it was clear that Hayao Miyazaki had finally gotten the appreciation he so long deserved on an international scale. With that it was time to see what lay ahead for his future work. In 2002 Studio Ghibli relased a follow up to my favorite of all his work, 'Whisper of the Heart'. While we are not so sure if 'The Cat Returns' is a sequel or in fact a prequil to his 1995 release it is probably one of the more surprising films he has given to us.<br /><br />'The Cat Returns' brings us the world of Haru, your average high school student who feels she can't get anything right. Then one day she just happens to save cat from being hit by a car. This cat just happened to be the prince of the kingdom of cats and has chosen Haru to be his bride. Haru is not so sure what to think, though she is brought to the kingdom of cats against her will , she wonders if maybe it is time to get a fresh start on her life. Luckally she had recruited some help just in case she changes her mind. The Baron makes his triumphat return along with the pudgy and hillarious Muta. It is a race against time to get Haru back to her world because the longer she ponders she will be going through some dramatic changes.<br /><br />This movie is not a deep meaningful story that will make you cry your eyes out. In fact it is a pure, simple and hysterical story. The Disney version brings some of the greatest talent to the table. Haru is voiced by the famous up an coming Anne Hathaway and Carey Ewells makes his return to voice The Baron. The late Peter Boyle shines as Muta and Elliot Gould and Tim Curry are riots. 'The Cat Returns is a perfect Ghibli film for all ages and it definitely shows that Hayao Miyazaki is far from over when it comes to bringing us his wonderful work.
0061733199|5.0|First, someone left a 3 star review because of illustrations.  That is SO reckless that I almost feel it's got to be someone who supports the competition.  The illustrations are great with great written details.      Now, I won't go into the obvious about the book because others have touched on the excellent details on survival within the book.  You WILL enjoy reading this book and you WILL learn survival techniques and you WILL create yourself a survival kit as a result if you don't already have one.    However, here is one thing I actually was VERY impressed with about this book.  The QUALITY of the book.  The book is SOLID.  The spine of the book is VERY strong and the pages are not cheap recycled type of rough paper. They are quality semi gloss type of thick pages that will likely last a WHILE under normal use.      I bought two, one for myself and one for my son.  I think I'll make this a holiday/birthday gift for friends and family for a while.  I want EVERYONE I care about to have this book in their life.    I got mine... did you get yours?  Run, don't walk.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Living in the US makes catching Doctor Who episodes something of a hit-or-miss ordeal, so I finally broke down and bought the DVDs.  They are well packaged, the episode guides are well thought out, and the image quality is great!  No issues with messed up discs; I bought S1-S4 when I ordered and out of 23 discs, only 2 had minor scratches and play without issue.    Highly recommended for anyone who likes Sci-Fi; esp. those with kids.  My niece and I have spent many an hour watching Doctor Who together laughing and it's a great way to spend a little time together in this crazy busy world with some quality entertainment.    You can't go wrong: Quality programming, well organized DVD set, and great for the whole family!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I watched this movie after hearing much hype about it's contents but decided that I wanted to remain neutral until I had a chance to see and evaluate it. I've watched several other movies that Moore has done and have found them to be funny, interesting and informative.<br /><br />I would have to say that Sicko certainly fits the mold. I'm sure that some parts are exaggerated a bit to make a point (or a laugh) but overall it is an eye opener. With all the discussion currently going on about healthcare it seems to me that everyone should view this movie and draw their own conclusions. I would like to congratulate Moore on taking on this controversial subject at a time when this needs to be explored.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Don't listen to the media...Don't base judgement of a work on how many radio friendly singles it has...this is THE BEST Kelly Clarkson Album by FAR!!!  I'll equate it to a really amazing independent film that has the same director and writer and hasn't been spoiled by having too many studio cooks in the kitchen.  Kelly bares her soul on this album...singing about the delusions of this transitory world and everyone's struggle to find find true meaning and happiness beyond the delusion.  It is full of vulnerability and truth, and whether she intended it or not..it is a deeply spiritual experience to listen to it as she sings about the universal struggles that we all must face.  This is an a amazing work of art and just like a Van Gogh painting, this CD will be appreciated in the years to come as the Masterpiece that it is...And like all great works of art, it rings the bell of truth about who we truly are.  Please, Please record companies...give this girl the complete artistic control she deserves because she is brilliant and by interfering in the artistic process you are interfering with the purity of Spirit that flows thru her to the listener.  Amen Kelly!
0307588335|5.0|As a Lehman employee who worked in the same group as Larry McDonald I was looking forward to reading this book. The firm had some of the most talented people on Wall Street working for it and it had the best fixed income business in the US. I thought that the book magnificently captured the spirit of Lehman Brothers. The firm's capital markets businesses were just as good as Goldman's but generally the firm was a bit grittier and was traditionally a bit of an underdog. We had a smaller balance sheet and were always trying to punch above our weight. When I joined the firm in the late 1990's, the gap between ourselves and the GS and MS of the world was quite wide but narrowed massively over the years. The mistake the firm made was pushing the accelerator at the wrong moment. I think Larry's book captured the essence of the problems at the top of the firm that contributed to its bankruptcy: 1) Lehman operated like a cult of personality   and those who dared to question Dick Fuld were shown the door. It was inconceivable to me that upper management pushed out the some of the best risk managers in the riskiest areas (Alex Kirk in credit and Mike Gelband in ABS) when they needed them most. These things, however, happened. Dick Fuld created an environment where sycophants were promoted and those with differing views were unwelcome. 2) The firm suffered from Goldman Sachs, private equity and hedge fund envy. The message in 2006-2007 was clear: take more risk. We had to catch up with the profits that other firms were making even though the market opportunity was not there. GS was harvesting trades that were put on earlier in the decade not using leverage to juice marginal trades. We took minority stakes at the top of the market in countless hedge funds and private equity deals. Management was desperate and throwing anything against the wall in order to see what would   stick. 3) Upper management was out of touch with risk management and with the evolution of the capital markets. Lehman always managed to beat the odds, most recently in 1998 and 2001, but markets had evolved to become much more complex and Dick Fuld and Joe Gregory were behind the times. The author hit the nail on the head. They were more concerned with philanthropy and diversity then risk management. The real travesty is that the firm paid its employees with a lot of stock which had the most onerous vesting schedule on Wall Street and then flew the plane into the mountain. 4) Dick Fuld was in a state of denial until the very end and failed miserably in his attempts to save the firm. It is ironic that the Gorilla of Wall Street was impotent when the many Lehman stakeholders needed him most. Larry's book showed many of these events including: his misread of the situation with Hank Paulson and the Treasury Department, not   inviting advisors to start the due diligence process and consistently overplaying a weak hand with potential suitors.     At the time of the bankruptcy filing I wondered why the powers that be opened up Pandora's box and unleashed the maelstrom that engulfed the global economy. Certainly it would have been cheaper to guarantee a Barclay's bid then to go through the implosion of wealth and capital losses that we have experienced over the last 11 months...There was no good reason to save Bear Stearns, AIG and allow Lehman to fall. That, however, is a question for a different book. A traders #1 job is to not put himself in a position to be at the mercy of others and Dick Fuld failed miserably in that regard.   Finally, I would like to address some of the criticisms that have been written by other viewers. 1) Investment banks are flat organizations and, although Larry was a Vice President (as opposed to a senior vice president or managing director, he had daily contact with very senior people. Larry McCarthy and Rich Gatward, Larry McDonald's direct reports, had 2 and 1 layers respectively between themselves and Dick Fuld. Additionally, Larry interviewed countless people (from press reports over 100) for the book and was able to get information from very knowledgeable and informed people at the top. 2) Although he was a late entrant to Wall Street, Larry was a very competent and profitable trader and the fact that he was let go before the collapse had a lot less to do with his talent and more to do with Wall Street management (which I often describe as on oxymoron)     In conclusion, \\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" is an excellent book. Although I found it a bit heavy on cliches and would have rather seen fewer pages devoted to the author's childhood and early business ventures, it is a relatively easy read that explains the technical aspects of Wall Street and in a thorough, yet enjoyable way. The book also describes the various contributing factors of the current financial crisis that we are going through (low interest rates, quest for universal home ownership, Wall Street greed, etc). I have read many Wall Street books and think it does the best job of any of them of giving an accurate (i.e. not exaggerated) account of daily life on a trading floor. The book gives great insight into the character of the firm and how Dick Fuld, Joe Gregory and a few other members of upper management led the firm to its disastrous end. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to people who are interested in life on Wall   Street, in the downfall of Lehman or just want to understand how it all went so wrong for the modern financial system.
0441017177|5.0|Alastair Reynolds has quickly risen to be one of my \\"buy immediately\\" authors. He is a master of the new Space Opera and writes hard science-fiction with engaging characters and mind-blowing ideas.<br /><br />House of Suns concerns a group of people called the Gentian Line, also known as the House of Flowers (in fact, every member is named after a different type of flower); 1,000 clones (or `shatterlings'), male and female, of an individual named Abigail Gentian. They travel around the galaxy observing the rise and fall of civilizations, meeting once every 200,000 years for a reunion. But this time, something has gone very wrong.<br /><br />This is a novel filled with huge concepts. The characters have experienced millions of years of life, once chase scene takes 60,000 years, but at the heart it is a very good mystery with some intriguing action scenes. Never does Reynolds over-write or fall too much in love with how clever he's being.<br /><br />A second plot follows the childhood of Abigail Gentian, and the events leading up to the creation of the Gentian Line. This secondary story is just as good as the first.

0061231401|5.0|I love James Rollins.  I actually found him by accident.  I found \\"Sandstorm\\" at a yard sale and I've been hooked ever since.  I love how Rollins adds fact with his fiction.  It makes you wonder what goes on in the shadows.  Don't read this if you think there are hidden conspiracies around every corner...it will make you scared to eat.<br /><br />The \\"Doomsday Key\\" has just the right amount of action and adventure.  I had the library order this book for me but found I couldn't wait and I bought it from Amazon.  It now joins the rest of the James Rollins books in my bookcase.  His books are worth reading several times.  There's always some new info I get each time I read the books.
B000WCDI5K|2.0|The only band I can think of that actually pulled off a really good b-sides album from beginning to end after releasing only two albums was The Smashing Pumpkins. Even great bands like Nirvana tried doing this as well but the outcome was inconsistent from what I can remember. The Killers needed to wait for another two or three albums before releasing a b-sides album. There is a few good tracks but it would have been better to wait for another couple of albums at least before releasing this so they could have a better selection of b-sides. I recommend downloading Where the white boys dance and Mr. Brightside remix.

B00005RIKI|5.0|I'll keep it short, since I am far from an expert on Southern Rock.  All I know is that this is one classic album with so many classic tracks, it almost looks like a greatest hits package an it's their debut.    The thing that always strikes me as amazing is how heavy a song like \\"Simple Man\\" is, it is so similar to the \\"power ballads\\" that so many bands would include in the late 70's and even moreso in the early 80's. And this track is to me so much stronger and powerful than most of the ones that bands (most not southern rock at all)  would churn out album after album to release after a fast paced rocker. All those 80's bands would include a song (or two).    Just one great band, and one great album.

Sorry to expose that information, but what happens next is too gross even for me.  I still have to turn my head on most of that scene.  Overall, I had to give it two stars for the quality of the picture.  Four stars for the movie though, its a gory ride.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I love this series!! In fact, I get HBO now just to see True Blood! I missed Season One, so I bought this set in order to catch up. I'm so glad I did. This set is great! I can watch the shows as often as I want and as many times as I want. I like it so much that I pre-ordered Season Two. Thanks!
0060723513|5.0|I don't care if Marlo dreamed the story or if she really traversed the desert with the tribe because what matters about this book is the message that it conveys. Everyone who said negative things because certain points of the story weren't accurate, didn't even 'get' the entire message she is portraying. I was raised in the United States and I have seen running rivers that used to be clear as the air, now run dark green and dangerous to swim in. That is scary to see such devistation in my 42 years on this planet. I feel that something MUST be done or humans WILL destroy our ecosystem and deam Earth unsustainable for human life.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|There's no way you can miss this excellent, lyrical, moving film.  It's the best vampire movie I've seen. I'm tempted to say it's not really a vampire movie, except it is.  Anyway, one thing I take from this film is that the most normal people in Sweden are two 12-year-olds, one of whom is a vampire!  What a bunch of screwed-up people the rest of the characters are--from the schoolyard bullies, to the stupid teachers, quarreling separated parents, lonely losers at the restaurant.  Even the weather is a mess! The relationship between the two kids seems to be the only redeemable thing here, and it very movingly portaryed  It's all brilliantly done in the film and I give it my highest recommendation.

0312427999|1.0|The fact that capitalism has taken a drubbing recently is not without its ironies. Any rational, informed person knows that the big failures in our system - the mortgage market and health care - are both the direct result of government involvement. We also know that the people arguing the loudest that the solution is more government involvement are the people who most benefited from that failure.     Thus, it almost goes without saying that anti-capitalism requires one to be ideologically blinkered and serially dishonest. Yet Naomi Klein's new 'bible' of anti-capitalism still manages to surprise in its level of sheer dishonesty and propagandist tactics.    There are so many flaws with Klein's thesis that one hardly knows where to begin: her staggeringly idiotic assertions about the motives of the Chinese protesters at Tianmen Square; her cherry-picking of examples from the largest, and most benign, free-market expansion and corresponding elevation of global living status in history; her complete misrepresentation of the beliefs of Milton Friedman, to the point of claiming his policies justified the Iraq invasion when Friedman was explicitly against the invasion (something she conveniently leaves out of her book); her idiotic theories that Katrina was welcomed as an opening for greater subjugation of the people to the horrors of capitalism; et cetera.     Johan Norberg of Reason Magazine sums up the situation perfectly while eviscerating her childish thesis:    \\"To make her case, Klein exaggerates the market reforms in question, often ignoring central events and rewriting chronologies. She confuses libertarianism with the quite different concepts of corporatism and neoconservatism. And she subjects Milton Friedman to one of the most malevolent distortions of a thinker's ideas in recent history.\\"    But leaving aside the fact that her entire theory is nonsense, there is still her hypocrisy to consider. Here's a recent comment from Naomi Klein:    \\"Do we want to save the pre-crisis system, get it back to where it was last September? Or do we want to use this crisis, and the electoral mandate for change delivered by the last election, to radically transform that system? We need to get clear on our answer now because we haven't had the potent combination of a serious crisis and a clear progressive democratic mandate for change since the 1930s. We use this opportunity or we lose it.\\"    This is, of course, the modus operandi of the leftist: claim that something is happening to distract and frighten people so you can then do that exact thing, e.g.: claim the 'free market' is to blame for government bungling and protectionism to introduce more government bungling and protectionism. As such, Klein popularizes the myth of 'disaster capitalism', ignoring fact and reason, specifically to enable the reality of disaster progressivism.     And judging by the rave reviews this utterly dishonest and disingenuous waste of paper received, that sinister method continues to work.

B000001EG6|5.0|Elton John - Elton John I (1970) (*****) 13 tracks (50:53)<br /><br />Elton John's first official US release is one of the only Elton John albums that I can honestly say I really like every single song on it. There just are no weak tracks on it in my opinion. This is the album that really got me interested in exploring more of Elton's early work. After hearing this album enough to really get into it, I realized that there must be much more unknown music of his besides what I had previously only heard on the radio or off his greatest hits album.<br /><br />This version was also the first of the Island records re-masters that I bought. The old original MCA version that I had was known to have excessive tape hiss on it, so I wanted to compare the two. Honestly, it's like night and day, literally. The background of the re-master is completely quiet, a much needed improvement! Now, as the bonus material goes, it is kind of hit and miss. It really doesn't add much to the original album. Bad Side of the Moon is a good song, but the two other tracks, an alternate version of Grey Seal and Rock and Roll Madonna are kind of mediocre. Still, over-all, this is a 5-star album.
1401923119|3.0|I bought this book because it was recommended by Wayne Dyer.<br /><br />It was very informative but seemed to be a little too scientific for long stretches for me.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This movie is a dumbed-down version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.   None of the characters are faithfully portrayed.  I would be ok with changes and creative edits if it were not for the fact that the characters have been morphed into either blubbering idiots (Mr. Bingley) or melodramatic ninnies who cry in almost every scene and physically run away from all conflict (Elizabeth Bennett).  This movie has exchanged wit for stupidity, charm with repulsive cheesiness, and even rid the thing of every piece of sarcastic humor that existed. Mr. Bennett cries in this movie for Christ sake!  It really is the antithesis of what Pride and Prejudice was all about.  I'm extremely saddened that yet another classic story has been destroyed by Hollywood.
0553582445|2.0|I am a bit disappointed so far.  1. If I didn't read anything by Robin Hobb before, I would give up after the first 50-100 pages because I would assume I were reading chicklit.  2. Too many descriptions. Too much of re-telling of old stories (probably intended to remind the reader what happened before, but way too much of it).  3. The story line doesn't have as grand design as it was in The Farseer and The Liveship trilogies. What is happening in Fool's Errand feels like a minor incident in comparison. Just as if I were reading an addendum story based mostly on The Farseer and a bit on The Liveship trilogies.    It is a page turner, but maybe I read it because I know and like Fitz?  I sincerely hope it improves...otherwise it will be one of the greatest disappointments.

0061020680|3.0|MORT is not one of Pratchett's stronger entries in the Discworld series. Taking the old \\"Death takes a holiday\\" premise and putting the Discworld spin on it is not quite enough to make this more than an afterthought in the series. Mort, whose constant restating of his name when called \\"boy\\" or lad\\" becomes his most memorable characteristic, (Showing just how poorly drawn a character he is.) becomes Death's apprentice and mild amusement ensues. Pratchett is always funny but this one lacks the originality found in so many other Discworld stories and pales in comparison.

1601251505|5.0|If you are familiar with 3.x branch of Dungeon & Dragons then you'll already have a firm grasp of the Pathfinder RPG. Some are even calling it D&D 3.75E---which is not far from the truth. Much has already been written about D&D 3.x so I'll keep this short and simple.<br /><br />First the book itself comprises both Players Hand Book and GM Guide which makes a very big book. It's logically organized with a concise Table of Contents and Index so information should not be hard to find. There is some nice consistent art work but not so much that it distracts from the content.<br /><br />One of Pathfinder's design goals was to make it compatible with 3.5E rules---so we can keep our extensive 3.5 Edition libraries with minimal conversion effort, in this it succeeds pretty well. Classes, skills, feats, spells, prestige classes are quick and easy to upgrade. Most monsters can be converted by just calculating Combat Maneuver Bonus (CMB) and Combat Maneuver Defense (CMD). Don't take my word for it, the Paizo website has a free 3.5 Conversion Guide PDF that covers simple guidelines for making most any kind of conversion.<br /><br />The Core Classes have cool new options and seem very well balanced. I'm specially enamored with some of the new options for the wizard ( which has always been my favored class ).<br /><br />The rules for skills and feats have been nicely streamlined.<br /><br />Combat has been simplified with a new single mechanic which allows for clarified special attacks (grapple, disarm, trip, etc).<br /><br />A reworked experience system allows for slow, medium, and fast character advancement (My players and I really like the ability to control and fine tune the tempo of a campaign).<br /><br />With Pathfinder, rules for the 3.5 Edition have been expanded, simplified and clarified but are still very much part of the whole 3.x Edition line.<br /><br />So if you had a good experience with Dungeons & Dragons 3.5, maybe have a large library of 3.5 material and you are looking forward to the future support of Paizo and third party publishers then Pathfinder may be the RPG for you.<br /><br />In my opinion, it rocks!y publishers then Pathfinder may be the RPG for you.    In my opinion, it rocks!

0307454541|5.0|Plot Summary:  We meet Mikael Blomkvist at his lowest moment; he's just been convicted of libel.  With his reputation in the toilet, and his little start-up magazine in peril, Mikael receives an invitation from a rich old man whose once powerful empire is slowly crumbling to bits.  He wants Mikael to solve the mystery of a 40 year-old crime involving the murder of a teenage girl.  As bait, he dangles dirt on Mikael's nemesis that could restore his credibility and destroy his enemy.  The other player is Lisbeth Salander, a free-lance P.I. whose detective skills are unparalleled and illegal.  Lisbeth is a prickly mystery all on her own, and her partnership with Mikael is a thing of beauty.<br /><br />I think every kind of crime is committed in this novel, except for grand theft auto.  If someone had told me that one of the best thrillers was part financial crime and part cold case murder, I'd have said no way.  It sounds boring, but it was absolutely riveting.  These unrelated stories find their connection in Mikael Blomkvist, a journalist whose snow white morals are blindingly bright compared to his dirty, lazy, and incompetent peers.  That's probably why he was an ideal target for the gangster businessman who sinks Mikael's reputation.<br /><br />Part of me grumbles that I should hate Mikael.  He's one of those handsome guys who is in his prime, and women are constantly making moves to get him into their bed.  Naturally, being a guy, Mikael never says no.  As much as I'd like to hate him for this, I can't, because he is one of the unequivocal good guys in the story.  Even when he was down in the dumps, I was envious of his easy charm, quick wit, and luck.<br /><br />Lisbeth is the one who made me a fan, and when I read the second book in this trilogy, The Girl Who Played With Fire, it will be because of her.  She's one of those heartbreaking stories, like a junkyard dog who is mean because she was abused, but she remains unbroken.  Lisbeth dresses like a punk, thinks like an anarchist, and has a mind like a trap.  I love that fierce edge that drives her to protect herself, and eventually, Mikael too.  She's a character worth following.<br /><br />So obviously I recommend this book, but there is a caveat.  There are several sexual sadists running around this story, and their crimes make me want to puke.  So if you're not willing to take a trip to the dark side for the sake of superb storytelling, then put this one back on the shelf.  This novel is for readers who can stomach the hardcore nature of the crimes.  I realize that not everyone is looking for something heavy when they read for pleasure, and so the warning is appropriate, but if you like a criminal thriller, this one will be hard to beat.nd has a mind like a trap.

0465043550|5.0|I had occasion to reread this book and wanted to offer my thoughts about how the ideas have held up. I'm a huge Mandelbrot fan, I consider him one of the great living geniuses who has changed thinking in many fields. Plus he's enormously fun to read, even when he's wrong (and co-author Hudson polished him up as well). However I also think he does not appreciate the full depth of financial questions and therefore gives too little credit to other views. In 2004, I thought this book was an excellent critique and filled with useful inspiration, but had a tunnel vision focus on price data as opposed to the living practice of finance.<br /><br />Looking again in 2009, after the upheavals of the last two years, and also after reading works like [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan]], [[ASIN:0470393750 A Demon of Our Own Design]] and [[ASIN:0691133611 Plight of the Fortune Tellers]], I would say time has been kind to Mandelbrot. The book is not dated in the least, it's more important to read today than five years ago. When you apply these ideas to price charts from 2007 to 2009 the ideas gain weight. And although many of his ideas have been incorporated into modern theories of risk, including the three books listed above, Misbehavior of Markets has additional ideas and insights you won't get from other sources.<br /><br />That's not to say the book has all the answers, but it had more of them than I thought five years ago, and I liked it then. Anyone serious about quantitative finance should read this book, and anyone interested in fun math as well.

The main character is an African lady thay has had some hardship in her life but she remains upbeat.  She loves her Africa and in that vein, she introduces us to her Africa.  That I did enjoy.  The author's imagery is quite good.  I guess the cases she receives are typical of Africa; but they lack any real mystery or excitement.  Her approach to them is rather homey.  If you would like to be introduced to Africa in a different way, then you will like this book.

0321543726|3.0|This books structure is a bit obscure. While you have to appreciate the various techniques being used throughout the book to solve real life problems I wouldn't recommend it to a total beginner. Furthermore it has some subtle errors, for example : page 599 with the list example. There is no way that a beginner could find out why that example is wrong. Additionally just below that example is says :\\" please convince yourself that this is correct\\". No it isn't correct. Another example is at page 635 where a pointer is initialised with an array element which is out of bounds and there is no comment that this is potentially dangerour or that the compile wouldn't catch this. I would propose this book to an intermediate C++ user. There it could shine.

0385341008|3.0|This is a warm and gentle, if completely predictable, bit of epistolary gratification. The authors are clearly enamored with their characters, endowing each with his or her own charms and quirks. The story unfolds engagingly and sustains interest, even if the outcomes become transparent relatively soon. A nice feel-good read with some memorable characterizations, but hardly anything to leave you feeling challenged or changed. A watchable Lifetime Original Movie (if such a thing exists).<br /><br />One deeply annoying itch, though; what is with the authors' obsession with alliterative character names? Susan Scott, Sophie Stark, Sidney Stark, Stephens & Stark, Simon Simpless, Adelaide Addison, Billee Bee, Gilly Gilbert, and a couple I've probably missed. I thought I was reading the children's version for a while.

074350917X|4.0|One Minute Manager was a runaway hit when first published in 1982.  It made popular a style of presenting a business lesson in very short story format.  This book tells 3 things that a manager should do: establish clear goals with employees; give praise; and give reprimands.  Praises and reprimands must be specific and timely.<br /><br />The one minute manager approach is not only to do those three things (above), but to do them in a minute.  This is great because a meeting would only last a minute.  Meetings can carry on longer than expected without a way to know when to terminate the meeting.  Also, some theorists say that meetings generally serve the purpose of affirming who is in charge.  This theory at least offers an explanation for why top management appears to enjoy meetings, especially longer ones, while the rank and file tends merely to endure many meetings.

1416594892|4.0|Thrillers and spy novels writers usually fall in the trap of focusing too much on the action while creating flat and very simple characters. Eventually, they also fall short on story telling, and end-up simplifying part of the story.   Different to most of them, John le Carré has done a very good balancing act. Overall, A Most Wanted Man has:  - A credible story: built around the appearance of a strange young illegal immigrant in Hamburg, who seems to have the rights to claim access to deposits in a German private bank. Set-up in the post 9/11 scenario, the story projects the complexities of intelligence agencies' relationships and how they have different methods and objectives.  - Relatively complex characters: le Carre's main characters have a story and a life behind them. They have strenghts but also weaknesses, they are right in some matters but also end up making mistakes. They are human.  - A well-written flow: more focused in story-telling than in action. Well balanced, too.    In short, I was glad to buy this book before a long transatlantic flight. Anyone who enjoys spy novels, thrillers, will probably enjoy this book as much as I did.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|I have heard people rave about this show and how smartly written it is, and how well it captures the atmosphere of the 1960s. It doesn't. It captures the LOOK of the '60s brilliantly, but otherwise, it's a caricature of that era. EVERY male character is a despicable, philandering, sexist pig who leads a pathetically empty life devoid of real meaning. Every suburban scene positively drips with the implication that these people all live utterly superficial, meaningless, shallow, phony lives, wearing polite smiles that they show each other, even as they connive and gossip maliciously behind each others' backs. And no one, but NO ONE is actually happy.  Every man and woman walks through life like a robot, doing what's expected and appropriate, and all secretly unhappy and unfulfilled.  There are no characters who really like their jobs, no husbands and fathers who truly love their wives and children, no wives who are genuinely happy to be raising their kids because they love them and love motherhood, etc.  What we seem to have here is an overreaction to the classic \\"Leave It To Beaver\\" or \\"Father Knows Best\\" view of life presented in the shows of this era.  If those shows over-sanitized life and presented a too idealized vision of American life, then I think this one goes too far in the other direction, and tries to make life back then look stylish and sharp on the surface, but totally rotten, corrupt, cheap, and ugly underneath.  The truth almost certainly lies somewhere in between.<br /><br />Take a look at how people behave on this show.  While I'm sure sexism and sexual harassment were a bit worse back then, it simply couldn't have been THIS bad. In one scene, in the first episode, one of the young executives looks a new girl up and down like a piece of meat, and then proceeds to offer gratuitous and explicit criticism of her her appearance and advice on how to sex herself up, right to her face. Come on! Sexual harassment was, as I said, probably worse back then, but this is outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.  The same character then asks this girls boss when he can have his turn with her, as though it simply goes without saying that she'll sleep with him; it's just a regular perk that goes along with the job, like having a key to the executive washroom.  Later on, another male character, who hasn't been so crude, spends a little time building rapport with this same girl, and she's glad to meet someone who appears genuinely nice and friendly.  And then the next thing you know, he gets her in an office, locks the door, and tries to start taking her clothes off.  Message loud and clear: he's just like all the rest.  Now really, was there ever a time when ALL men just took it for granted that every attractive woman was available and willing, and any woman who is nice to a guy will just roll onto her back for him at the first opportunity?  I don't think so.<br /><br />And the writer's portrayal of racism, and classism is every bit as much a caricature as their portrayal of sexism.  This show is stylish, the dialogue is smartly written, the actors' performances are top notch, and the production values are superb.  The show recaptures the appearance of the early 1960s brilliantly.  But the treatment of how people lived and worked and acted is not nearly so well done.s outrageously rude behavior by ANY standard, and I know that simple good manners and politeness did exist back then.

B001XJEKGC|5.0|Eric Clapton, Steve Winwood -- two superstars who love the blues and together with cats like Willie Weeks (Steve Wonder, Rolling Stoness) on bass Chris Stainton (Joe Cocker bandleader) on keys -- really bring this old music to life. Maybe they are not as wild or pretty as in their youth, but they play better than ever. From the first note this is a classic with nice old bluesy numbers mixed with the rock classics -- all with virtuoso chops and arrangements so tight they can't even squeak! Pleasant surprise is drummer Ian Thomas, who only has to step into such shoes as Ginger Baker, Jim Keltner, Jim Capaldi, Jim Gordon and Buddy Miles (great version of \\"Changes\\" here sung by Winwood), and does so flawlessly. I like this as much or better than the Cream reunion or the Crossroads DVDs. It's the band.
0307456625|4.0|The author, Alexander McCall Smith, was born in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodedia) and spent his youth in Botswana, the locale of this novel.  Botswana Africa is seen through the eyes of the major character, Precious Romatswe, the lady detective.  We get to know the people of Botswana, it's capitol, and her contemporaries.  It is a detective story but no murders or violence.  Mma Romatswe's cases usually involve finding out things that her clients want to know; finding lost children, philandering husbands,relatives, or the like.  She is charming, sensitive, and clever.  But the book is really not about detective cases but about how the people of Botswana, from the cities to the villages, feel, believe, and act. The characters are finely drawn and McCall Smith's writing crisp and often charming and very often quite hilarious.  His descriptions of Botswana are vivid, detailed, and one feels like one has lived there.  This is the first of 9 novels about the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency, all of which I have purchased and five of which I have read, and each of which, in my opinion, increase in enjoyment.

0380807343|3.0|There is a door with a brick wall behind it in Coraline's flat.<br />But sometimes the wall isn't there and a corridor leads to<br />a mirror of her parent's flat.<br />The 'other mother' who lives there is actually<br />the spider-witch who sucks children dry.<br />The victory of Coraline and her black cat over<br />the 'other mother' is what this book is a about. The result<br />is sort of a modern fairy tale of the bad witch<br />versus the child.<br />Although I personally didn't like the tale much,<br />that doesn't mean that it doesn't have content for the modern child<br />whose parents seem to busy too give her the attention that she wants<br />during her summer vacation.

1400034779|5.0|Lo and behold, I am reviewing a novel with a more or less realistic setting to it! This was a case of picking up a popular book on a whim since I had heard how good it was, and finding to my delight that it lives up to its expectations.<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe, the lady manager of the titular detective agency, can easily stand alongside Agatha Christie's Miss Marple as a folksy but savvy sleuth. The cases she covers seem simple and even ordinary -- an over-protective father worried for his daughter, who only wants to be cut some slack; a con man trying to defraud his latest employers over an over-exaggerated work-related injury; a doctor suspecting a hospital worker's competence -- but she approaches them with a keen eye and a clever, even quietly sassy way to coax the people involved into divulging the truth, almost tricking people into making a step that uncovers what they try to hide. The \\"voice\\" of this book has a simple, artlessly child-like quality to it, like the tone of a story-teller. The setting, Botswana on the edge of both the South African border and also the Kalahari desert, is as much a player in the stories as the human characters, and through Precious's keen eyes, you get a feel for the soul of the land itself. I feel like I learned as much about the country as I learned about how people live there and how deep they feel for it and for each other.

0465043577|2.0|In several places, I saw this book touted as revolutionizing the investment world. I decided to get it and check it out. Having read over 200 books on investing, I was a little doubtful Mandelbrot had found the secret of investment success.<br /><br />As many other reviewers have already pointed out, Mandelbrot is a unique individual who comes across as extremely arrogant in this book.<br /><br />The whole premise of this book is since modern financial engineering is built upon the two key assumptions of normal distribution and independence of returns........the whole field of financial engineering is wrong because in the short term......returns are not normally distributed and are not independent.<br /><br />Investing is a lot about predicting the future.  Mandelbrot might have been well served by reading Sherden's book, The Fortune Sellers. Sherden points out that forecasting or predicting the future is the 2nd oldest profession.  It is now a multi billion dollar business.<br /><br />Sherden examined about every major field where forecasting is used:<br /><br />1. Weather<br />2. Economics<br />3. Stock market<br />4. Population sustainability<br />5. Scientific advances<br />6. Futurists<br />7. Corporate predictions<br /><br />Interestingly enough, the largest number of people in any of these 7 forecasting groups is the 200,000 people who do financial advising....involving trillions in assets.  Weather forecasting only has about 6,000 people......but it is a $5B business. Sherden concludes the only area where the future can be forecasted accurately is weather predictions......and their accuracy is only good for a couple of days into the future.<br /><br />Mandelbrot correctly points out that many phenomena in nature are based on the power law compared to normal distributions.  He correctly identified Pareto as one of the pioneers in power law research.  Pareto found that 80% of the income or wealth is typically owned by 20% of the population.  Pareto found this phenomenon to be true in several different countries.  It is true today in the U.S. as well.  Mandelbrot forgot to mention that most people can utilize Pareto's results by applying the 80:20 rule to many areas of business and their lives [80% of the effect is usually caused by only 20% of the inputs].  For a much better and thorough review of power laws and their practical application see The 80:20 Principle by Koch.  If you want to stretch your brain a little thinking about power laws, read Mauboussin's More Than You Know.<br /><br />Mandelbrot points out that short term price changes (daily) are not normally distributed and they are not independent. Mandelbrot argues that daily price changes might be better explained and predicted using power law math versus normal distributions.  I don't have an argument about this suggestion.  Then Mandelbrot makes a big leap and says that fractals can explain and predict short term price changes. Although fractals are interesting.....I really don't see the evidence that using fractal mathematics truly explains and predicts short term price changes.  I don't know what the answer is to predicting daily price changes.....but I'm sure many people continue to try to find out this answer.<br /><br />As a long term passive investor, I am only interested in annual returns, not daily returns.  From all the annual historical return data I have seen, annual returns do fit normal distributions relatively well compared to short term daily returns.<br /><br />The Sub-Prime Crash of 2008 is not a Black Swan event from my perspective of focusing on annual versus daily returns.  The long term average return of US large cap stocks is around 10% with a standard deviation of 20%.  Assuming a normal distribution for annualized returns, one would predict that 99.97% of future annual returns would fall between the average plus or minus 3 standard deviations........or -50% to +70%.  Since the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested fell 37% in 2008........it falls within the predicted band.<br /><br />I could buy the argument the Sub-Prime Crash of 2008 was a systemic Black Swan event. It was caused by at least 10 different parties all playing the right role to have a financial crash.<br /><br />1. Federal Reserve left interest rates too low too long<br />2. Congress encouraging lenders to give loans to people who couldn't afford them<br />3. Borrowers taking out loans they could not repay<br />4. Real estate agents encouraging higher prices to increase their commissions<br />5. Mortgage brokers who lowered lending standards<br />6. Banks who gave loans with no traditional rules for safe loans<br />7. Investment banks who packaged loans and sold them as safe investments<br />8. Rating agencies which assigned low risk grades to high risk investments<br />9. Investors who bought these mortgage investments<br />10. Regulators asleep at the wheel with respect to loan practices and institutional risk<br /><br />If any one of these 10 parties had raised a red flag, the real estate bubble would have stopped.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed with this book.  Besides having to put up with the arrogance of Mandelbrot, he repeats known phenomena (daily prices are not normally distributed and not independent).....and suggests that maybe power laws or fractals can explain short term price movements.  Of course, if one could figure out how to accurately predict short term price movements using a combination of power laws and fractals, there is a Nobel Prize waiting for you...as well as a beach in the Caribbean to enjoy spending all the money you could make on short term price changes!<br /><br />Instead of this book, I would suggest you read Sherden's book on forecasting, Koch's book on Pareto's Rule, and Mauboussin's book More than You Know.<br /><br />In this age of full disclosure, it can be noted that I am the author and publisher of the book INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS: HOW TO SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE AND BEAT THE PROS.

I am also a contributing author to the book THE BOGLEHEADS GUIDE TO RETIREMENT PLANNING available from Amazon with an estimated release date of October 2009.

B0009353IW|5.0|In \\"Chavez Ravine\\", Ry Cooder is a novelist, a historian, a musicologist, a sociologist, a producer, an arranger, a great guitar player, songwriter, lyricist, humorist, and human rights advocate.    This album is a must have for folks who are hip to real art, great music, or just plain old justice for the common man. In it, Ry takes a journey back in time to when the powers that be in Los Angeles took over  a small poor hispanic community, threw out all the residents (landowners and American citizens) and bulldozed the whole shebang to make room for Dodger Stadium and Walter O'Malley's baseball team.    The story is tragic. The story has replayed itself since and can and probably will replay itself again. And again. And again.    The music is a mix of traditional Mexican music of the day (1950's) performed by the real deal, and some very skillfull and sensitive tunes from Cooder and his cohorts. I dare anyone who cares about his fellow man to listen to \\"Third Base, Dodger Stadium\\" and not shed a tear or two. Beautiful.    Highly reccommended.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|A surprising American series indeed. And yet it is fascinating. Nostalgia first. 1960 with the duel between Nixon and Kennedy. It is amazing to recapture these old pictures and these old events, and the reactions of some people to the events that were going to become historical if not frankly historic. Nostalgia too with the presence, excessive presence, total submersion if not flood of tobacco smoke in these episodes. I defy you to just feel like following them and chain, double chain, triple chain smoke the way they do. They kiss and smoke at the same time, smoking through their nostrils or their ears I guess. Was there a place where we could not smoke in those days? I don't even remember a non-smoking area, except maybe on trains, one compartment per carriage, when there were compartments. Smoke detectors were not trendy yet. Still  nostalgic but in another style and direction with the Korean war, but in a dramatic way: a lieutenant being killed and his identity assumed by the only witness, a simple soldier from nowhere who volunteered in the war to escape his own family he hated completely and utterly. The film is cruel about this episode, and yet the man is a success story on the basis of a college diploma he never passed, but who cares? No one of course. No deserting, no real criminal act, except the exchange of a dog tag with a dead officer. But then the nostalgia is quite tempered by the insight the other questions that are evoked here bring about some further evolution in society. The main and central problem is that of women. These women who were supposed to be beautiful to just find a husband through some work, at times, but not too much, then make two children, a boy and a girl if possible, and take care of the family home without letting any stranger cross the threshold. Those who worked real hard were not envisaging a housewife career but rather a plain career, be it social, economic, artistic or whatever. They were the new postwar generations of women who decided that the housewife fate was not for them, and anyway the economy required them to work and the incomes of workers and the new needs and consuming possibilities required a second income in the home. Here the film is quite clear about the motivations of women, of working women as well as of housewives. They want to have their say in things, their independence in life, the recognition of their personality and identity. The series is cruel though at times, but so true. Cruel with these housewives who are so bored that they waste their time on checking the phone calls of their husbands, and finding out about their affairs, the good old western Christian or Jewish polygamy. Cruel about the women who use their sex appeal or their yielding to the sexual appetite of the men around them just for their vanity and to have some small presents and advantages, like a canary in a cage. Cruel when a woman gets some authority over another woman and over-uses it, abuses it and even abuses the girl or woman she is supposed to take care of. But the worst cruelty is against all the macho phallocratic men who behave with women as if they were servants, subservient, as if they had to be crawling at their feet and obsequiously submissive. The men are odious, purely idiotic, blind but also conscious at times that something was evading and escaping them, that women, married or not, wives or not, Jewish or not, were taking over the territory that was becoming theirs, the family, their desk space, their waste paper basket, their box in the personnel lounge, etc. We just wonder if things were really like that and we have to remember that yes they were and yes they were changing in that direction. The last thing I would like to say on that series, I mean the first season of that series, is that there is a lot of humor nearly everywhere, and at times, quite often indeed, sad humor, but humor all the same like about the Jews who are still ghettoized, or a lesbian woman who is nicely diplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it. We are still in 1960 and Kennedy has not been elected yet and the real battle about civil rights is just starting in a way, for the Blacks. The Jews are maybe slightly different, but the gay and lesbian people are far from the beginning of the decision to just open the door of the closet one inch to see if there is anyone in there. I must admit it is good to look back, not in anger but in shame and in gratefulness, at times that have changed in this period that was just the very first step towards real freedom in our countries, and we are still far from the fulfillment of Roosevelt's promise about the four freedoms. By the way, what about the freedom from want in the healthcare field of poverty and misery, what about top notch surgery for a coronary accident of a homeless person?<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGIDplomatically negotiated by her room mate, or a gay man who is curtly and coldly pushed back by the closet homo who does not want to admit it.

0061689246|5.0|\\"Stardust\\" is the tale of Tristran Thorn, a young romantic who sets off on a journey to find a fallen star to give to his (undeserving) beloved, Victoria.  It's an effort that takes him through a carefully-guarded gap in a wall and into the magical realm of Faerie.  In Faerie, things are often much more than they seem, a lesson Tristran learns quickly when he discovers his fallen star is actually a beautiful, young woman named Yvaine.  The story is heartwarming and witty, and will stay with you long after you've closed the cover.  I recommend it without hesitation to anyone with an adventurous spirit and a romantic flicker in their heart.<br /><br />[audio version]  There is something both enchanting and comforting about Neil Gaiman's reading of his novel, Stardust.  I am relatively new to the world of audio books, and to date, Stardust is the only one I have listened to more than once.  Gaiman whisks you away to the land of Faerie, and it soon becomes a place you'll have no desire to leave.  As a reader, Gaiman gives each character a distinct tone and lends his own charmingly British accent to the narration.  As an added bonus, there is an interview at the end in which Gaiman chronicles the creation of Stardust, from idea to book to audio book (mention is made of a movie deal, but at the time of the recording, it is still \\"in the works\\").

0553384775|1.0|A colleague recommended I read The Wolf of Wall Street, explaining how he couldn't put it down once he got started.  Sadly enough, I did not quite enjoy the book half as much as he did.    The title, The Wolf of Wall Street, left me with the impression that the book would follow a slick investment banker or a shrewd stock broker, discussing how he made tens of millions of dollars before reaching 30 years old, and possibly delving into the antics and behaviors that would earn a young guy such a name like \\"The Wolf.\\"  However... no such topics were touched upon even once in the entire book.  Jordan Belfort, the author of this self-aggrandizing autobiography, could have titled the book with a phrase he used (and used proudly at that) in almost every chapter to describe the spectacle that had become his daily life subsequently following his rise to opulence: \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Dysfunctional.\\"    Had I known not a single story in the entire lengthy book would even so much as take place on Wall Street, I likely would not have picked up the book.  Had I known this was a 500+ page story dominated by seemingly exaggerated tales of drug abuse, and had I known most of those drug-related stories would simply be recycled and reused in one form or another in just about every chapter, then, once again, I likely would not have spent hours and hours reading this work.  The Wolf of Wall Street doesn't even attempt to explain where and why Mr. Belfort received that nickname for which the book was apparently named.  Had I wanted to read an entire story about sexual debauchery, drug addiction, and the dysfunctional families such popularly indecent tendencies give way to, I would have gone to the `Self-Help' section at the book store (as opposed to the `business' section, where this book was found).    This simply was not the story I expected, and the slick marketers who designed the cover and helped come up the title for this novel really pulled the ol' \\"bait and switch\\" on usinnocent readers.  Anyway, I should have put the book down after page 100, but I just kept waiting for the good part, or the insightful part, or the meat of the story..., but, truth be told, this book lacks direction, lacks a plot, lacks in insight, and doesn't ever really go anywhere.    I would not recommend this book to anyone, and I struggle to understand why my coworker would ever refer a book like this to me in the first place.  I will not read the sequel, because I already feel like I read the same 100 pages 5 times over - I wasted enough time and money the first time around, and I refuse to read another 500 pages worth of Jordan Belfort repeating the same stories in various settings.
0446691437|5.0|This book really helped me to look at \\"be-grudging\\" in a much different light.  I can clearly see how be-gruding anyone or anything, for example the rise in gas prices actually hurts me more than anyone or anything else.  When I own the responsibility for the creation of the experience no matter what anyone does to me, I can see clearly how I have created the program that caused them to treat me or do to me whatever it is they did then I am able to forgive myself and the other party.  When I see prices rising and know it's ok that the money will be there when needed, it always is.  If I don't own responsibility for the creation of the experience or believe it will be ok then I reap suffering and lack rather than good.  It's all my choice.  It's all about denial and being in resistance or allowing life to be what it is and to Trust Divine Sweet Spirit to take care of me and my loved ones. Trust Life to work for you, not against you.......Namaste.    In Loving Light,    Joysong
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|First of all, Coldplay is not for everyone. It is particularly not for immature high-schooled kids who are easily amused by homophobic jokes about Coldplay.     Now, about the album. This is surely Coldplay's best work to date. The songs ooze melody, something sorely missing from today's popular music. Music = melody, at least that what it originally was. I am not dissing other forms of music such as hip-hop etc....but I like my music melodious. Viva la Vida is somewhat of a concept album, something bands haven't successfully done since Pink Floyd.     If are a mature person appreciative of finer things in life, you will absolutely love this album. Oh and don't forget to get the EP Prospekt's March - a surprising bunch of gems there too
B00005QGAT|5.0|With unmatchable pacing and manic energy Michael Jackson's Off The Wall is one of the best albums ever released, and out of all the Disco era music I've heard this album has probably aged the best of them all.  Perhaps the defining aspect of this album's success is the excited tone Jackson puts into every single, this being before he became one of the world's most iconic figures and before he became the Tabloid's favorite target.  This makes Off The Wall his most excitingly fun album.  It is free of his `Save the World' messages and loneliness so it just makes the album a lot of fun to listen to from start to finish.<br /><br />Songs Include<br />Don't Stop `Til you Get Enough - The most infamous of the album's singles Don't Stop `Til You Get Enough is one of Jackson's best.  This song is just exciting one of many on this album that make you want to take to the dance floor.<br /><br />Rock With You - A lovely ballad that is one of Jackson's best slow-dance songs.  The song is sweet, tender, and has an undeniable great beat.<br /><br />Workin' Day and Night - Another in a series of songs that just about force you onto the dance floor.<br /><br />Off The Wall - This is probably Jackson's best title song of an album.  It's serious in lyrics, yet at the same time it has a fun tune that gets your body moving.<br /><br />She's Out of My Life - One of his famous concert songs it is sweet and heart wrenching.  Many people who understand a break-up, or even if you have never gone through one should feel the emotion of this song's tune and lyrics.<br /><br />All the songs on this album and it's the most exciting of Jackson's albums.  It isn't his best album but it certainly is the most free-spirited of his albums.  You can tell that he had fun recording the album and that this was treated more as an experiment than a profession.  It falls behind Thriller on the chart of Jackson's great albums and with a low-price you are insane not to have this album in your collection.
0679809015|5.0|This is a very simple book, smaller than I expected, but my 15 month old really enjoys it. We find lots to talk about in the details of the picture, plus the lift-the-flap pages keep her entertained.
031606792X|5.0|It took me awhile to see the Twilight movie. After all the teen fan reactions I just figured it was one of those High School teen love stories done with a vimpire motif. Once I finally watched it, that was not the case at all. I wanted more, more, more! Knowing it was based on a book I figured I'd buy it, because they always say that the book is better. When I found out there were four books, I had to have them all. I devoured them! I couldn't wait to find out what happens next as was disapointed when it was over. Stephanie Meyers has a way of writing that has the story effortlessly playing itself out in your imagination like a movie.<br /><br />This was the best of the series, if I had to choose one. What makes it so good is that you have come to truly know and understand all the characters. I couldn't put it down, when I did I couldn't wait to pick it up, and when It was over I wanted to read it again. It's the culmination of all three books. Breaking Dawn just bring everyone full circle. It brings the characters that we love around to lives it seems they were destined to lead. It brings them to the happy ending we all hoped for them but couldn't imagine happening against all odds. I cried, I laughed, it was an emotional roller coster I never wanted to get off of.

1428156585|5.0|This is a remarkable story of courage.  Ayaan Hirsi Ali is certainly one of this century's heroines.  I recommend the recorded version.  (I had read the book earlier.)  Ms. Hirsi Ali's reading increases the listeners understanding more than I would have expected.
1416550542|5.0|I am off for the summer so I get to read a lot. I was so lucky to begin my summer with \\"the help\\" and now end with \\"The forgotten Garden\\". In my opinion it does not get better than this. The forgotten garden tells the story of three amazing woman who each bring a part of the whole picture to light. Nell is abandoned at four years of age, on a ship heading for Australia and learns on her 21st birthday, the facts of her adoption. Cassandra is her grand-daughter who picks up the mystery of her birth, after Nell's death. Eliza is a member of the doomed aristocratic Mountrachet family, who has written a beautiful book of children's fairy tales in the 1900's. At first I thought I might be confused as the chapters weave between 1900 England, 1913 Australia, 1975 on the Cornish Coast and back to 2005. I did not have to worry, the author does this with amazing skill. All three women were incredible, there was no one character I preferred, and all parts were tied together so beautifully at the end. Some reviewers comment that they felt the men in the story were weak. While this may have been true, to me they were meant only to support the women and move the plot along. While \\"The Forgotten garden\\" is a love story it is more about love of mother/daughter/grandmother or sister/sister/brother. In other words love or need for family. I thought the one fully etched man in the book belonged, and that his love story did not feel forced (Christian).  To me his reappearance at just the right time, had a lot to do with fate. If your doing what you love, and your where you love to be, good things will happen. I read The House at Riverton and really liked it. Kate Morton's second book is even better. It is beautifully written, has three strong minded heroines, great atmosphere, and a flawless ending.

0753801728|5.0|themes of this book intertwine into a compelling story that parallel the relationship between the post war German youth and those that participated in the Nazi movement.  How does a new generation evolve from its terrible/unthinkable past and how does a new generation move on and take ownership of their county?  Every section of the book parallels this moral divide: the affair, the trail and the conclusion.  This book examines all of the gray areas of the issue and never leaves the reader with just one clear emotion.  You are never lead to hate Hanna even through the affair.  One would believe an affair of this nature would be repulsive, but the reader never feels that way.  Both characters are flawed and heroic in their own right.  Both characters struggle with inner conflict and outward embarrassment which makes them both very human.  That ends up describing this story best, it is very human.      This is a great book for a reading circle as it easily spikes thought and conversation.  You are unable to read this book without examining how you would feel.  The only complaint I have about this book is the ending which seems a bit anti-climactic and simple for such a complex book.  Because Michael is narrating the story I can understand the ending and the reader is left making up their own reasons for Hanna's decision.
B001FB55H6|2.0|this movie is worthless it is so boring and long like the spirit even though i like DC comics this one is to watch out for. this is the worst comic movie ive seen this year
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I love this album and it's on constant repeat on my Ipod. There is more than just the radio singles that have been played on the radio, most notably \\"Crawl\\" and \\"Cold Desert\\". I would encourage everyone to buy this album!
B001TODCII|1.0|I watched this because my countryman, the excellent Mr. Neeson, was in it. And what did I get? Another Jack Bauer, a superman who can beat any number of assailants, who guns down approximately 300 of them in the course of this film, who is completely impervious to pain, who has no hesitation in resorting to torture, who has the most amazing luck and physical fortitude, and who rescues the fair damsel (in this case, his daughter) from nasty foreigners who talk funny. If one watches these sorts of espionage/agent films, be they Bond, Bauer, Bourne, whoever, one has to buy into the mythology that these people can really do these things, the way cowboy films required the acceptance of the fast draw that never existed and deadly accuracy from guns that couldn't hit a barn door from inside the barn.<br /><br />Anyway, the plot is entirely predictable, the characters flat and the baddies completely dastardly (and therefore doomed). We won't even start on the many totally outrageous plot strands. Mr. Neeson, sir, pleeeeease leave this sort of stuff to genuine hams, such as Kiefer Sutherland!
B00001ZWTT|2.0|I believe it was Wild Wild West starring Will Smith that my cousin took me to the movie theater to watch back in 1999.  I had fun at the movie theater, but didn't think much of the movie.    At first I couldn't believe it- Will Smith in a movie like this?  Growing up a minor fan of his extremely popular hit TV show Fresh Prince, I didn't think Will Smith had a CHANCE in Hollywood back in 1999 when he made the switch to movies after the show had ended.  This is the movie that made me question Will's decision to attempt movie roles.    Luckily, Will Smith ended up making good movies after Wild Wild West, but this was certainly NOT a good movie.  I remember having fun at the movie theater the day my cousin took me there, but now I remember why I didn't care for the movie.    For one thing, every single predictable thing you can possibly imagine about adventure movies is probably featured here, and since every storyline twist is so predictable and boring in the film, you know what's going to happen almost every single time.  This is inexcusable to me.      The writing in Wild Wild West is absolutely bland.  It's not funny either.  I get the feeling the movie is trying to be like Indiana Jones with the style of adventure and light comedy bits, but almost *none* of it makes me smile, laugh, or even feel enticed enough to finish watching the film.   I don't even know if the jokes are just not funny, or if the film is more aimed towards children.    The joke about the guy dressing up as a woman wasn't very good because it was taken a bit too seriously and used too much as a joke to fall back on more throughout the movie.     Will Smith himself wasn't funny either.  His character was really good, but when he tried mixing comedy with the shooting scenes, it didn't work.    It feels like a movie that could have had promise had the writing been better.     Well it certainly LOOKS like a good movie going by late 90's film standards and Hollywood effects and whatnot.  Wild Wild West ends up being the biggest disappointment you could ever imagine.  Adventure movies are not supposed to be boring.  At least to me, it's extremely hard to find something negative about most adventure movies that attempt more or less the same thing this movie did.   This movie just completely misses the mark and isn't recommended to anyone.
0143038583|3.0|I really think first-person folksy should be confined to Ya-Ya Sisterhood-type books and not something as serious as human nutrition. Pollan flatters himself by thinking that everyone wants to see this topic through his sensitive yuppie eyes. I would have loved, for instance, to see a graphic illustrating his attempt to explain the layout of Joel Salatin's pastures. Is that too much to ask? No effort was made in this book to even use graphic illustration (and there were dozens of opportunities in the middle of rambling, wordy sections screaming for a picture or diagram), let alone to communicate in a scientific (horrors) manner so as to be understood as objective, interesting, or credible. I find it obvious that Mr. Pollan, being a journalism teacher and not a food scientist, found it mandatory, in writing a book about food science, to use the storyteller approach since he is not qualified to speak on this topic otherwise.     Then, there was the necessity for going back and reareading the many sentences that either were un-punctuated or that contained typos, double words, grammatical errors, or out-and-out illiterate usage. So, I'm mystified by the many laudatory comments on the author's writing. Maybe his classes at Berkeley are self-paced sessions in which no one is graded or otherwise rewarded for using the language well...

0312427999|5.0|No other work of recent history or study of \\"globalization\\" has managed to make so many major world events fit together so coherently.  The synthesis of research is truly astonishing.  Yes, the thesis is sweeping and there are oversimplifications, but this work truly does reveal a master narrative of contemporary history that will change the way you understand current events.
0385341008|5.0|We actually read this as part of our book club and of course \\"vicariously\\" dreaming of winning the trip to Guernsey.  That didn't happen BUT, on the whole we enjoyed the book a lot.  I particularly thought the references to the variety of behaviors of the German soldiers and the resourcefulness of the locals was very informative.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I got this in the mail last Monday. I used it immediately. It was SO HARD. I was so very sore after using it. The next day, I felt like I had been hit by a bus. I was extremely sore. It hurt to walk, to stand up or sit down. It just hurt. So obviously I didn't do it on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, i was still sore, so I rested that day too. Then my sister (who was in the military) said that you should work through the pain, so I decided the next day whether I was sore or not I would do it. So on Thursday, I did it again, again, it kicked my butt, but then I did it again on Friday & Saturday & today Sunday. So in total i've done it 5 days now. I've been dieting & using Alli for a few weeks now, i just now incorporated working out in with my diet regimen. But I can feel it working already. I am still ready to kill over at the end of the workout, but i'm being able to tell a little bit, that i'm able to do it. BUT i haven't even attempted to use the weights yet. I've just been doing it with no weights, going through the motions though, & that works, I figure next week i'll probably be able to add the weights into the workout. The end of every workout I am sweating so bad & breathing so heavy. It's all I can do to just get a glass of water & sit down to catch my breath. But I believe that this workout & my diet I will lose the 40 pounds i'm trying to lose!!
B00278U1W0|2.0|Trust an owner of 100+ music concert DVDs and Blurays...this one is ruined by incredibly poor AUDIO.  The video is fine.  The audio is a distorted mess.  It isn't my system.  I listen to all kinds of music and mostly hi-rez audio either in the form of SACD, DVD-A, or high definition 24-bit/96kHz or higher files.  I have a great appreciation for sound.  Something went very wrong during the recording or mastering.  They either used too much compression (which creates terrible distorsion)or the gain was wrong.  Either way it is most noticeable on vocals...although in general the Bluray sounds harsh even at low volumes.  My kids even commented.    So strike 1 - it is a Bluray without uncompressed audio as a sound choice (only DTS and PCM low rez)  Strike 2,3,4 - the sound is compressed and distorted unlike any other DVD or Bluray I've ever heard.    Such a shame.  Otherwise it could have been a very nice concert Bluray.
B00003CWPL|5.0|This is perhaps David Lynch's best film. Eraserhead came out in 1978 and has been a cult favourite ever since. It is a surreal story filmed in haunting black and white. It is a horrific and funny story. It is a nightmare.<br /><br />My impression was that the film is a depiction of a possible dark future with warnings about the dangers of an industrial society gone off track. There are deformed monstrous babies, and people living scared in their dark apartments not knowing their neighbours, surrounded by noisy industrial complexes where no trace of nature seems to exist anymore, only railway tracks, dirt and gravel. A picture in a room doesn't show a tranquil beautiful landscape, but an atomic explosion. People are living in the shadow of this industrial world which has overtaken everything, and has even darkened the sky with its soot.<br /><br />Whether taken as a movie with a message or as just the representation of a surreal, nightmarish world, this film is truly unique and is one of the most perfect cinematic films ever made.
B000244FDW|5.0|I have always loved Pride and Prejudice and happened upon this version on Netflix, in the watch instantly online part. This was a great adaptation of the book and I positively fell in love with Mr. Darcy once again. This was made in the 80's and so is not the modern looking masterpiece that some people seek but I thought it was fabulous!

0470449748|4.0|A must for everyone studing the GMAT. It has lots of real past questions with their explanations. The \\"cons\\" are a) the \\"theory part\\" is very poor and they just repeat what you should really now and don't provide with useful formulas for the \\"difficult questions\\" b) the answers are explained too short and only one way in most of the cases, while there are many other ways, some of them simpler and more understandable.
0756405890|2.0|I have to admit, Patrick Rothfuss' Name of the Wind seems overrated.  It's getting rave reviews, and I was excited to read it, but it took literally days to muster the interest to get past the first hundred pages.  My god, they are incredibly boring.  Honestly, if Rothfuss took out nearly every scene with The Inn except for the last two, and THEN we find out what we're reading is Kvothe's story in his words, that would be better...but, that's me.    Honestly the book kind of sucks until MINOR SPOILERS:          Kvothe gets to the University, starts getting back into playing music, chasing Denna, etc.  It's interesting.  But I just didn't understand why Rothfuss spends four or five dull chapters describing THREE YEARS of Kvothe surviving slums by himself, then like 300 pages for two terms at the school.  Huh?  The pacing makes no sense. Not giving anything away, but he literally spends ONE PARAGRAPH at the very end describing a crucially important part of his life.      Pacing was the biggest gripe for me with this book, but i had two others: Kvothe, and suspense.  Kvothe is, let's be honest, a jackass.  He's unlikable.  I felt like there were too many 'oh, look how precocious and clever he is!' moments when really, he was being a jerk.  I did not care about him, and when your entire series is about how awesome he is, that's a problem.  I cared more about Denna than him, and would want that romance to work for her sake, not his.    Secondly, all the 'action' sequences, of which there are few, seem forced, added because Rothfuss was told to by his publisher.  And at times, Kvothe will end a chapter with 'oh, little did I know that SOMETHING INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT would happen, or 'that was before I knew SUCH AND SUCH'.  He just tells us what ultimately will happen, and then the rest of story is getting there.  How is that exciting, or remotely interesting?  It isn't.  Maybe the characters know about Kvothe's legendary antics but we don't.  Don't tell us what happens.Really, the book was disappointing.  I kept waiting to be blown away and wasn't.  Terribly overrated.  This gives you an idea of what the book was like:  I got it along with another fantasy book by an author I never read before, and along with this was excited to check out.    I would pause reading The Name of the Wind to look at this other book, and wish it would be finished quicker so I could start the other one.    Really.  It's boring. This is the first fantasy book I've read that was truly a disappointment.  Get from the library, don't buy if you have to read it.  Can't say I will rush out to find out what happens to Kvothe next.  I wouldn't mind just never finding out.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|The 3rd album from the talented group the Jonas Brothers is a rocker! There songs are amazing and the fact that they recorded all of this while on Tour which shows how much time and energy they put on their CD. My favorite songs are: \\"Burnin' Up\\", \\"Tonight\\" Video Girl\\" and \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" This CD is worth your money! Buy it!
1433503794|4.0|I love my new bible! It is full of very good references and interesting facts that I didn't know. I also love the on line bible study so I can do my studying when I traval. The ability to listen to the bible on-line while I am reading as been very beneficial to my study time. I would highly recommend this bible to anyone who is considering buyig a new one, whether they are new to studying the bible or are just looking for a very good study bible to addto their existing one.
B0016PM722|4.0|Just like the title I'm telling you. Buy this only if you want it as a collectable.    There is a group of guys out there who make light sabers that are brighter and insanely durable. You can throw them in pools, run over them with cars, and of course... hack the heck out of each other with them.    Anyways, if that's what you want then buy those. They aren't as pretty (made out of pvc or something, not chrome metal like this) but they are a lot more fun and cheaper.    For you star wars fans if you want something to impress your friends then this is it. Also, it does have it's own durability. You'll want to baby it but you can smack this thing around pretty good before something breaks.    Metal handle is pretty but gets finger prints on it when you walk by it, hah!
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Yes, I know that it doesn't conform to the book as much as we would like, but this movie is still highly entertaining and captures the spirit of the novel.  I think the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy is well acted by Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen (especially him).  I LOVE the way Macfadyen plays Darcy.  Also, Judy Dench is brilliant (as always) as Lady Catherine. She's SO much better than the actress who played Lady Catherine in the BBC version.      All in all, this is an enjoyable movie that I've watched about 5 times so far.
B002BW7ADK|4.0|I was absolutely smitten with Sweet Disposition the very first time I saw the (500) Days of Summer trailer back in January, and it's taken me this long to snag the whole Temper Trap album, and I'm pissed at myself for that.  I expected to only like S.D. and nothing else, but it's turned out to be one of my more Go-To albums in the last couple weeks.  I'd make a humble comparison to Bon Iver meets a chilled TV on the Radio.  Regardless if that means anything to you, it works.  And the fact that 500 Days introduced me to The Temper Trap, just makes me love the movie even more.  This $30+ price tag is ludicrous though, considering it's a 10 song album.  For that price I half expected the band to hand deliver it to my door...

Not even willing to shave head , wear turtle shell or even sunglassed . Just wasted my time watching this movie to write this review and be honest. I don't like it , Action was good , but the big battle sucked . They should have made the movie in 3 parts and hope that someone would have payed for the other 2 movies . They should have made a movie introducing all the characters , and Asian actors . Start with emperor pilaf. If successful make  more anime movies of dbz or rest of bd with bathroom humor and get the customs right
0061231401|4.0|I've long been a fan of Clive Cussler and thought no one could top his mix of history, adventure, and technology. But Rollins is the new king, and this book is very satisfying. With topics taken from the headlines, interwoven with Rollin's frenetic pacing, believable characters and out of this world technology, The Doomsday Key is a true thriller.<br /><br />Not only that- I actually learned something from the book- that the real-life cause of the massive honeybee die-off has been found! Further research shows that it has been suppressed by large agricultural interests. Makes me want to scream it from the rooftops. But I don't want to spoil the book, so by all means, buy and enjoy. This one is great from its fast start to the fantastic finish.
0061684384|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. Lots of pics of tattoos Kat has done and great details about her personal tats.  I would have liked a little more on Nico Hurato but I don't think he was at High Voltage when she wrote this.    Can't wait for her (maybe) next book on her journal stories (she talked about this in the last episode of LA INK) and the most memorable tattoos she has done.

B00065JTBA|4.0|This Box Set contains 4 CD's and a DVD of mostly unreleased songs.This is not a Greatest Hits set.This is for the Bon Jovi fan who has everything else and wants more.   I grew up in the eighties and had both Slippery When Wet and New Jersey on vinyl and have followed this band for the last 20 years.They are part of the soundtrack of my life and I have all of there albums.I have felt for along time that while they are a very good band there need to be the biggest Rock Band out there and to sell albums has stifled there creative edge.   This Box Set proves that this band deserves to be considered one of the best bands of the last 25 years.Every song on this set is good to very good.There are 15-20 songs that could have been hits.   If you grew up in the eighties like me and like Bon Jovi I highly recommend this set.It showcases a side of the band rarely heard on there studio releases.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Not one ego at the performance.  The artists nailed the songs and captured the songs both technically and emotioinaly.  If you like only one George Harrison song, you will like more of his songs after you see this concert.  I hope the concert will be offered in the blue ray format.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|a long time. Don't be late. Soon after I realized that this is much more of an intense fantasy than I reckoned. I love alternative history. Violence? Of course it's Taratino. Extremely so. The bloody & bizarre nature of his movies of mayhem are startling but not terrifying. It is the overkill. By contrast, Hitchock's movies were more scary with the unpleasentness occuring off-camera. Brad Pitt is the leader of the basterds,a U.S. Army unit of Jewish commandos in occupied France during World War II. They kill Nazis, scalping them &  terrorizing them right up to Hitler, played as a raving mad buffoon. Absolutely stand-out performances by Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa, SS \\"Jew Hunter\\", a vicious , polite, sociopath. Melanie Larent is Shosanna, the French Jewish heroine. Waltz performance begins & ends the movie & brings the parallel story lines together. Both should be strongly considered when award season comes around. Pitt's performance as Aldo Romaine is courtly, brutal & really funny. He is really a co-star, but he sells the movie. Particularly spectacular is the theater scene near the end. It is over the top & everyone there gets killed twice, maybe three times.

0307454541|3.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is written by the late Swedish author Steig Larsson and considered an international masterpiece. It's been translated into multiple languages and one copy of this book have been sold for every three Swedes (population around 9 MM).<br /><br />When I heard about this book raved about in a book blog I follow, I had to read it for myself.<br />There are two central characters. First, there's Michael Bronkovist, a fallen financial journalist that was hired to solve a 30+ year mystery of the disappearance of a niece of a wealthy industrialist. Then there is Lisbeth Salander, whom the book is named after. She is a 23 year old social ward of the states, afflicted with Asberger syndrome-- a socio-path with multiple piercings and tattoos. Although she is socially awkward, she happens to be an expert hacker and extremely good at her job in background investigations.<br /><br />Their paths meet and together, they end up solving the mystery. They do end up having a fling, but their relationship is very unlike that between the key protagonists of  your typical mystery novels.<br /><br />While the storyline was average, I did enjoy the fact that Larson did not feel the need to launch into complex explanations on some scientific or archeological phenomenon (think about how much time an author like Dan Brown and Crighton spent explaining these phenomenon to support their storyline). The ending is fairly predictable as well, especially once you find out the book's original title--Men who Hates Women.<br /><br />So, what did I like about his book? For me, what made this book phenomenal is its complex web of characters and Larsson's ability to truly develop his key characters. Lisbeth Salander is unlike any protagonists I have ever read about: Socially awkward, semi-gawky looking, angry, self-confident and a hacking genius.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to reading the newly translated book that just came out: The Girl That Played with Fire.

6305014140|4.0|Ninja Scroll / 6305014140<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />We first watched \\"Ninja Scroll\\" because we're working our way through the anime section now that we've seen all the Miyazaki movies. I understand that this is a movie tie-in to a popular series but being as always late to the bandwagon, I haven't seen the series and can't comment on that aspect of this movie. Let's get one thing straight - this movie is not for children or for people sensitive to blood or violence. Limbs and body parts are frequently hacked or torn off, and the blood spurts seem on par with a Tarantino film. There's also some graphic sexual content here, with a female ninja almost-raped by an opponent, some frank discussions of sex and sexual orientation, and one snake-themed villainess produces vipers from unusual bodily orifices.<br /><br />If you're still reading after that content warning, then I will note that this is an extremely interesting film, if the content doesn't turn you off. \\"Ninja Scroll\\" can't seem to decide how important ninjas are seen in the society at large around them - on the one hand, the officers of the army treat them as expendable and disposable, but on the other hand, the \\"techniques\\" that the ninjas (both good and bad) have mastered are nothing short of magical, and dangerous deadly magic at that. In no particular order, we have a female so steeped in poison (by fate or by choice, we don't know) that her very touch kills; a man who willingly hosts deadly hornets in his body and uses them as a weapon, as well as a woman who does the same with vipers; men who can turn their bodies into stone or knit their bodies back together after losing limbs; and much more. All this makes for some extremely interesting battles, many with surprising or unusual endings.<br /><br />Which isn't to say that \\"Ninja Scroll\\" is perfect. Like pretty much all anime movies, you have to watch it at least twice just to really understand what's going on. The English dubs and the English subtitles do not match at all, a cardinal sin of anime for those (like me) who are partially hearing impaired but not completely deaf, and while the subtitles are usually better dialogue than the dubs, it sometimes seems necessary to have *both* in order to be completely clear about the situation onscreen. Some of the violence seems a bit gratuitous, and at least one major plot 'twist' is as predictable as the sun rising in the morning. Having said *that*, however, there's quite a lot here that is surprising and unpredictable, and it's very nice to see heroes who behave in a sane and sensible manner, although I have to deduct mental points for having the heroine rapidly descend into hormonal whininess because the writers weren't sure how else to script dialogue for a tortured woman doomed to loneliness.<br /><br />I have to recommend \\"Ninja Scroll\\" just because it's so fantastical and unusual - I've honestly never seen anything quite like it. I honestly much prefer films with less graphic violence and sexual violence, but if you can get past the graphic content (and the worst of it seems to be in the first 20-30 minutes of the film), there's a good chance you'll enjoy it as I did.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollinal sin of anime for those (like me) who are partially hearing impaired but not completely deaf, and while the subtitles are usually better dialogue than the dubs, it sometimes seems necessary to have *both* in order to be completely clear about the situation onscreen.

B002DKGWSO|3.0|For those who love to see a good movie pop in hi-def, you might as well get the dvd instead.  The movie is good, sometimes a little too long during the more graphic scenes but usefull when it turns into a movie where the audience begins to chear on the people who turn the tables.     Picture qualtiy- Starts out great, but as you get into the movie about an hour or so there are some whole scenes that are cut back to again and again until the end of the movie, these are extremely grainy and even some light issues as well.  Some have said the director might have intended this but I do not see the purpose if he did.  It will switch between two different angles during the scene in the kitchen with the wife and the badguy sidekick, one angle the picture is flawless the next will be extremely grainy and then cut back to the flawless again.  this happens over and over in the kitchen scenes and does not end until the credits.    Sound- great sound quality, what you have come to expect from blu-ray.

0143113100|5.0|Norman Doidge's THE BRAIN THAT CHANGES ITSELF methodically dispels the mainstream understanding of how certain parts of our brains are permanently wired for specific functions.  For example, it has long been accepted that there are specific areas of our brains dedicated to speech, motor control, vision, etc.; however, The Brain That Changes Itself illustrates the flexibility of the human brain to adapt to changing conditions, whether it be through the practiced stimulation of alternative sensory pathways or the continued learning of new ideas.    What might seem to many as bordering science-fiction, Doidge presents profound case studies that demonstrate the often unnoticed and untapped abilities of our brains to change both the way we think and the physical, biological brain itself.  Doidge's writing style and his attention to the reader's train of thought conveys his passion for this topic.  Take time to read the appendices in his work!  Even his detailed notes help the reader reinforce the wonderful ideas presented here.  I highly recommend this book to all students and faculty of Psychology.  We've taken this topic for granted too long!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|True Blood is a highly entertaining series - the first season is better than the second, in my opinion. It is basically soft core vampire porn, and therefore is extremely not recommended for youngsters.

If you think Twilight is for teens, then this is the better version for adults!

B002436WFI|3.0|I never really liked The Color of Magic and The Light Fantastic much.  IMHO they are the weakest of all the Discworld books, and that's certainly understandable since they were the first two published.  So when I saw the well-produced Hogfather movie and liked it, then learned The Color of Magic was made into a movie also, I decided to take a chance.  I expected the weak Color of Magic story and the Hogfather-level production values and acting quality.<br /><br />Well, as to production values this is not too bad.  We certainly see a lot of Rincewind closeups for long periods, sometimes to the detriment of other characters or situations that could use a little exploring (Cohen, Twoflower, the dragon home, etc.).  I feel that David Jason was much too old to play the Rincewind of this era, who is supposed to be about 30; Jason looks his age (68) in this.  If they can make a 54-year-old Alan Rickman look like a 30-year-old Snape, they could make Jason look younger too.  The sets are good, but the overall pacing feels too slow.  Note that this is a 2-parter, each part being 90 minutes.  I feel the whole thing could have been done more successfully as a one-part 2-hour movie, if they had only picked up the pace (not cutting anything out).<br /><br />Now as to the acting:  At first glance it seems Jason is overdoing it, but Rincewind is an over-the-top character, so that's OK.  Where I had problems was with Sean Astin, who seemed to be trying to out-American himself and put all memories of the word \\"Hobbit\\" firmly out of everyone's minds, and Tim Curry, who plowed through this woodenly, his so-called \\"evil grin\\" more a rictus of discomfort.  It seemed as though he were gritting his teeth in frustration the whole time.  It is perhaps due to the fact that there were a lot of camera shots zoomed in on characters' faces (including Cohen and Bethany) where the camera seemed to be held too long.  It makes them appear as though they're just looking woodenly (I hate to repeat myself) off into space.<br /><br />So, there are some pieces of this whole that didn't quite fit, and for that reason I give it only 3 stars.  But I also consider the material flawed.  I'm hoping more Discworld books make it to the screen, with actors who are committed to doing Oscar-quality work.lf) off into space.<br /><br />So, there are some pieces of this whole that didn't quite fit, and for that reason I give it only 3 stars.

It is not a wimpy little workout.  You have to WORK OUT!  I love that I feel like I had a great workout in only a few minutes.  I love how it is broken up into cardio, strength, and abs cicuit.  For the price, you can not beat it.  You just need some space and hand weights.  I memorized all the cicuits and now do them while I catch up on my favorite shows.  It is not easy but a great workout. I would recommend it to anyone with a time crunch and willing to change their body for the better.

B000F0UUIM|5.0|The best Western I have ever seen, a poetic epitome. The mastery of composition and stagecraft is unsurpassed. But this is an American movie made for American audiences and its harsh, primeval bite is softened, mollified (if not falsified?) by John Ford's effortless showmanship: the savage finale, the genocide, the bloody break of day cheapened, sanitized using some trustworthy detergents: heavy-handed humour from Wayne junior and a timely, narrowly-beamed spotlight on an indisputably cute damsel in distress.     In comparison, the fate of the Comanche tribe, left to the depredations of the blood-thirsty settlers - a tribe that we have followed with not a little fear and interest for a decade with our two heroes - is of little consequence!     The unbearable denouement bearing the hallmarks of a Shakespearean tragedy is all too cozily extenuated: the family reunited, the old man, the still-fresh scalp of an Injun in his pocket, rewarded for his loyal service by a gentle fade-out as the credits begin to role...     In his book 'Arguments for a Theatre', the British playwright Howard Barker says \\"You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool.\\" Whilst 'The Searchers' is undoubtedly a beautifully-made film, Bogdanovitch alleges that John Ford himself complained that there was too much music. The Searchers are well-armed and dangerous but they recoil from a steely confrontation with their own Truth, seeking - like the film's audience - refuge if not redemption in the warmth, good cheer and companionship of the all-American hearth.     But Nietzsche admonishes us in 'Beyond Good and Evil' that the falseness of a judgment is not for us any objection to it. The question is to what extent it is life-promoting, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-cultivating. This timeless yet flawed masterpiece fulfils all of Nietzsche's criteria munificently.

0765356147|3.0|I believe this trilogy changed dramatically with every book. The first book felt like a thievery/caper/revolutionary novel, the second was mysticism and mystery and the third was doom and judgment. The Well of Ascension had me turning pages dying to find out what happens next, The Hero of Ages had me turning pages hoping something would happen. This book is full of entirely too much inner monologue, complaining, soul searching, and contemplating. I already read a book full of Elend trying to come to grips with being in charge yet wanting the people to lead, why would I want to read that over again in this book? Vin doesn't like killing and isn't sure if she is, or should be, the Hero of Ages. Again, we knew this coming in. Why spend the first 400 pages reiterating things we already knew? The surprises/shocks everyone mentions weren't that great. The ending was a tad unexpected, but not too surprising. Overall, this novel was too wordy to be enjoyable. I lost interest in the plot early on and the book was unable to recapture my attention. I skipped large sections of Sazed complaining about his lack of faith and most of the sections with Spook. Unfortunately, this book was not able to live up to the excitement and mystery of the first two. This would have done better as a stand alone fantasy novel of 600-800 pages. Decent, but not great.

The action is bad, the drama is bad and the acting is bad.  The story itself isnt half bad but the director blew it.  I watched this movie with three friends, two of whom had to go to bed before its conclusion.  How this got compared to the matrix ill never know.  To me it looked to be just another rushed attempt to make a film.  Taye Diggs really shined in this one though hehe.
0321525655|1.0|I have to rain on the parade of Nancy's book and Garr Reynold's book (and other ones). This is based on the review I gave Duarte's \\"Slideology.\\"<br /><br />The message is \\"I'm one of the best slide designers in the world (which is true) and I'm going to show you WHY.\\"<br /><br />The message should be \\"I'm one of the best slide designers in the world and I'm going to show you HOW.\\"<br /><br />You'll see plenty to interest you, but unless you're a full-fledged graphic designer you'll never recreate these slides. Imagine putting this book (and Duarte's book) into a room with some of your worst slide creators, or even yourself. Would you see an improvement in their skills? I doubt it.<br /><br />You might as well become a painter by reading books that have the world's greatest pictures in them. Even though there is explanatory text here it isn't enough to bridge the gap.<br /><br />To see a book written for its audience, try the \\"Before and After\\" books by Jon McWade which deal with desktop publishing. Unfortunately John has not yet tackled slides, but you can see an page layout idea and make it yourself in minutes.<br /><br />So, sorry about this, because both this and Duarte's book are \\"nice\\" books. The energy has gone into the book's design and production rather than the content. But that makes them coffee-table books, and unless you have a coffee table in your office I'd advise that you give both of them a miss.

The resolution is adequate, and was a treat for me given how many times I have seen these movies on DVD.

B001TOD92C|5.0|I don't get it.  How did Mickey Rourke get snubbed by the Oscars in probably one of the most incredible performances by an actor in years.  Some people would say there are paralells between \\"Randy the Ram\\" Robinson and Rourke but that's okay.  Both the actor and character he played are down on the ropes after experiencing past glory.  Rourke probably saw this as a last chance to resucitate a dormant career and with every fiber of his being he make's the Ram's desperation real to the audience.  I'm not a wrestling fan in the least but I was exalting when the Ram took on his longtime \\"foe\\" in the ring at a dingy hall where his prior glory was achieved at the hallowed halls of Madison Square Garden.  Kudos as well to director Darren Aronofsky whose showed great promise in \\"Requiem for a Dream\\".  Aronofsky lens the film in a semi-documentary style that places the emphasis on character and he should be applauded for allowing the story to tell itself and allow his actors, which also includes terrific turns by Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, to shine.  Inarguably one of the best films of 2008.

0374280967|5.0|Alan Bennett has brilliantly crafted a creative testimonial to the life-changing power of reading.  This captivating novella cleverly imagines the happenings following Queen Elizabeth II's accidental discovery of the library's bookmobile on the castle grounds.  She reads one book...then another...and soon she is more deeply devoted to her books than she is to her public duties.  Excuses are made to accomodate her passionate reading habit, and staff members began to resent her literary pursuit.  Eventually, she begins recording notes and musings in a notebook.  A laugh-out-loud ending completes this charming book.  Mr. Bennett has written a delightful tale about discovering the wonderful world of literature and how it can happily change lives, even the Queen of England's!  He has beautifully portrayed a passionate reader...always yearning to get back to one's book.  I could certainly relate to the Queen's obsession with books.  As with her,  finding the time to read is a priority and very often reading interferes with my everyday duties.  I have also experienced resentment from others when I branched out to do something different.  I absolutely loved this delightfully entertaining book.  It left me reflecting on how reading has influenced my life.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|Honestly, I was never a MCR fan. Far from it actually. I was very down on them because I perceived them as just another whiny emo band like Fall Out Boy or Panic at the Disco. Boy was I wrong. I saw them open up for Linkin Park in Projekt Revolution 2007, and their performance was so good, that I actually went out and bought this album to give them a chance. Since I bought this album, it has become one of the favorites in my collection, second only to Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", LP's \\"Hybrid Theory\\", Alice in Chains' \\"Jar of Flies\\" and The Chili Peppers' \\"Californication\\". Being a fan of both classic rock and hard rock/metal, this record was a great fusion of modern and classic styles and techniques.     The musicians do a great job with this one, the drums are crisp and perfectly timed, with some quite original fills, the guitar has a great tone that reminds me of Brian May of Queen, the Bass is understated, but drives the song without being overpowering, and Gerrard Way's lyrics and vocals are nothing short of poetry. The mixing on this album is professional grade, which is more than I can say for a lot of other bands. The instruments work in harmony to produce a unified sound as opposed to sounding like they're competing with each other, and never does one overtake the others to any unreasonable extent. Truly a very well produced record. So, with that said, on to the actual \\"track by track\\" review.    Track 1) The End.  A pretty good opening track. The heart monitor that starts the CD out as well as the rather macabre lyrics really set a good tone for the rest of the album. What really impressed me about this track was the transition to the next one \\"Dead!\\". It was such a flawless transition, that I actually backed up the entire track to listen to it again! Unfortunately the track its self is a little on the short side, so only 3/5 because of that. Otherwise a pretty good opener!    Track 2) Dead!  One of my perennial favorites, it has a great, upbeat verse and chorus, which are juxtaposed to the, again, rather macabre lyrics for a strange, but kind of cool effect. One of the best things about this track is the guitar riffs and solos. Being a guitarist my self, there are few things that make me happier than my favorite instrument played well. One of my absolute favorites, 5/5.    Track 3) This is how I Disappear   Another good track. This one is a bit harder edged than the previous two, and offers a slightly more \\"hard rock\\" side of MCR. Good, and still macabre, lyrics plus a driving drum beat and guitar/bass riff make this a good tune worthy of a listen! 4/5.    Track 4) The Sharpest Lives  Another harder edged track. Don't be fooled by the seemingly inconsequential opening lyrics, this track rocks. Hard. This was the track that really got my attention when they played live, and was a track i listened to nightly in my first year of college. The real highlight of this track is it's arrangement, there are so many layers and nuances to this song, that it still offers new twists and turns even after well over 75 listens (not counting the ones where I just pressed the \\"back\\" button to start the track over!) Another favorite, 5/5.    Track 5) Welcome to the Black Parade  Here we are, the big one! The title track! Most of the time, in my experience, the title track is never quite as good as I think it should be given its prominence on the album. Not so here! The opening, with its emotional vocals and soaring guitar riffs brings to mind vintage queen and the main verses and choruses of the song combine drum rolls, riffs, layered vocals, synth, and even a brass section to create what I can only call an anthem. To put that in perspective, the only other anthems that come to mind readily for me are Journey's \\"Don't stop Believin'\\" and Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\", esteemed company! From the beginning \\"militarily march\\" like drum rolls, to the swelling ending, this track's a real gem! 5/5    Track 6) I Don't Love You  A goodtrack. A ballad with enough catchy hooks to stock a tackle shop. The best part of this song for me are the lyrics which are masterfully written. Combine that with what (and I'm dubious to say this, but darn it, I will anyway!!!) sounds like actual, real gut wrenching emotion from Gerrard Way, and you have a great song! Another one of my favorites on the album. 5/5.    Track 7) House of Wolves  This may be my favorite track on the album. The riffs scream classic rock, while the vocals and lyrics are uniquely MCR. A classic song structure with 2 choruses, 2 verses, a bridge and a outro/solo, follow the blueprints for a hit to the tee. My favorite part of the song is, hands down, the outro/solo, where the guitarist absolutely wails on the guitar with Gerrard doing what he does best on this album, rocking! hahaha! 5/5.    Track 8) Cancer  Wow. Another slow song, and one of the saddest songs I personally have ever heard. The song, as the title would suggest, is about someone dying of cancer. Gerrard's imagery in this song makes it nothing short of heartbreaking (and I don't even have a family member I've seen die of cancer. I can't imagine how those who have had that experience would be affected by this song.) The only complaints I have about this song are that it's a little short, and that since it's so sad, I actually avoid it, which is sad, since musically and lyrically it's a good song. 3/5.    Track 9) Mama  This track is very interesting. It starts out with bomb blasts and gun fire in the distance. The song is written from the perspective of a soldier who has gone to hell, and is writing a letter to his/her mother. The song is quite nihilistic, and morbid even for MCR's standards. Musically the song's great, combining key and tempo changes, unconventional rock instruments (accordion, violin) as well as the talents of Liza Minnelli. The song's lyrics are actually quite controversial, which is actually a turn off for me. If there are two things I can't stand when I'mtrying to enjoy my self, politics and religion, and this song (depending on how you take the lyrics) has some of both. If you don't mind these things in your songs, that's great for you, but for me, they bring an otherwise good song down from the level of some some of it's peers on the CD. 4/5 for me.    Track 10) Sleep  A good, fairly straightforward rocker. The intro sounds almost arabic, which is quite an interesting twist, especially for a band like MCR. That being said, this is probably one of my least favorite songs on the album. Don't get me wrong, the song is still good, but the other songs with it on the album seem to stand out much more and have many more defining characteristics than this one. 3/5.    Track 11) Teenagers  One of my favorites, and a perennial radio favorite. This song rages against society's need for conformity. Again, this song has some of the greatest hooks and is almost too catchy for it's own good. The stripped down parts of this song, again, bring to mind Queen songs such as another one bites the dust, and the rock oriented choruses do justice to the modern-classic rock sound of the album. Overall a great song! 5/5.    Track 12) Disenchanted  The last real ballad on the cd, and another possible contender for my favorite song on the album. This song evokes as much emotion as \\"Cancer\\" for me, but it's a different type of emotion. This song brings up more personal feelings and momories, and less empathic feeling. The song somehow brings me bittersweet memories of my friends, who have since left for different colleges and places, as well as thoughts on my own life and the the general lives that make up the human race. Very disparate evocations I know, but that's what makes this song great, the ability to bring up so much emotion from different places at the same time. If you really want something to think about, this is the song for you. 5/5.    Track 13) Famous Last Words  Another rock oriented track that I would say verges on anthemic,especially toward the end in the refrains. This song is the last full song on the album, and what a great ending song it is. Throughout the album, the songs have been quite dark and nihilistic (appropriate for a concept album about death, but still quite morbid none the less)this song is the first one (maybe with the exception of some parts of \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\") that seems hopeful. the words and music both have an air of \\"pushing on\\" and continuing, working through the dark times to reach something better. A great song and, yet another of my favorites. 5/5    Track 14) Blood  This mini track serves as a sort of outro for the cd. It's all in the style of a 1920's standard, even the recording process was changed to make the song sound like it was playing from an ancient phonograph. The lyrics are quite possibly the most morbid on the album, but somehow seem less substantial than the rest of the cd, probably because of the \\"campy\\" nature of the song. An ok attempt as a song in the vein of the Offspring's \\"When You're in Prison\\", but to me, it doesn't really feel as much like a legitimate part of the album, as a bonus easter egg. 2/5    So there it is. I know I sound like a \\"fan boy\\" with this review but trust me, I was MCR's biggest critic before I listened to this album. For a person as stubborn as me to go 180 on his opinion is nothing short of miraculous, so please do your self a favor and give this one a chance to win you over too.
1933771690|4.0|This is really good book.  At first, I didn't think so, and I felt Lanza was a bit over-posturing at times... and I felt this again several times while reading it... poor kid makes good (all right already).  And I get a little suspicious when the narrative goes from \\"I... I... I..\\" to quickly \\"the authors think...\\"  There really wasn't enough of Berman's recognized input.  Nonetheless.... having said that... and that's why four stars instead of five... this is a really good book.  Good to read.  Good to think about.  And he (Lanza? Berman?) does a really good job of presenting the potentialities.  It makes you stop in your tracks several times, and wonder about those things we are supposed to wonder about.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'm convinced, though -- I'd love to hear a discussion group on this... maybe with Robert Wright and Gerald Edelman, for instance.  No, our consciousness does not (cannot) CREATE the universe... we've adapted so that we CAN consciously REALIZE  (our section of) the universe, but I'll bet there are higher consciousnesses, intelligences, beings, et al, that probably look on us as bugs.  Lanza... you're on the right track, I just don't think we're ready to hand you the Nobel Prize (over this one) quite yet.  Please keep going though.<br /><br />[There is probably some disclosure in order here... I own stock in Advanced Cell Technologies, which is Lanza's stem cell research company... that's how I found out about him and his book -- and I saw the notice on MSNBC.  I still think it is an up-and-coming enterprise, and there's no doubt Lanza is a smart feller, and they have a good reputation  -- as does the good doctor -- I just thought I should mention it.]
0345451325|4.0|After playing Halo 2 for a few weeks, I decided it might be fun to do some light reading. Usually, whenever you read a book that is based on a movie or video game you will end up with an easy summer read.    I really enjoyed Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach which creates a back-story for the first Halo video game. The story begins with how the Spartan's were created. You journey through their genetic and physical alterations along with their combat training.    You get to see more Spartans than just the Master Chief found in the Halo video games. And then you get to see their destruction.    Nylund does a fantastic job creating characters and their surroundings. As you read the book you can't help but imagine what this vision would look like on the big screen.    The Fall of Reach is the title of an event where the alien Covenant, locate and destroy a military planet named Reach. Nylund goes to great detail while not being slow or boring when it comes to the ground and space battles.    The story ends right as the first Halo video game begins.    I can't wait to read the next book, Halo: The Flood.
1405054093|4.0|My 9-month-old daughter really enjoys this book because she loves to lift the flaps herself and see the animals behind.  However, I'm not sure she listens to the words at all.  Also, the flaps tend to stick a little which means I have to \\"un-stick\\" them for her before she can get them open.  There is one page that is especially tough for her (technically two flaps opening - like a double door), but that leaves a challenge for her.  I'm sure she will become a master at getting all the flaps open herself in the coming months since we go through this book a few times a day - it's one of the first that she goes to every time I get out an assortment of books.    This was one of her first flap books, and it was great fun to watch how quickly she learned how to open the flaps even when each page opens a different way.  I could see her learning/remembering how it worked from the first time we read it.  I expect that it will also be helpful in teaching her the animals involved in the book since we read it often.
B00288KNLS|2.0|I can't believe how disappointed I was in this movie, after hearing about how \\"breathtaking\\" it was and being a fan of movies in this genre. Perhaps it's one of those movies I'll appreciate more after I think about it for a few weeks... or months, or watch it a second time (no thank you!).  But as it stands right now, that was 100 minutes I'd like back and a thousand unpleasant images I'd like to return.    Breathtaking? Brilliant? I'm sure the stop-motion was a tremendous amount of creative work. So if it was, why would they go to all that trouble to make everything so damn ugly?  I'm all for macabre and dark, but most of the imagery in this movie was harsh, grating, uncomfortable and creepy - not in a good way.  There were only a few scenes that made me go, \\"Oooo, wow\\", and the rest was just ICK.  And what was the overall moral of the story?  \\"Appreciate your neglectful and awful parents, because there might be soul-sucking murderous parents out there you could have instead\\"?  Sheesh.    As for the PG rating.... that seems rather lenient.  I'm 37 and felt like I needed adult accompaniment to watch this, lol.  A friend of mine has a young daughter who read the book, and after she did was so freaked out by it she said she never, never, never wanted to see the movie. I can't imagine the book being more disturbing than the movie.  I'm not a huge supporter of being over-protective of what kids see and watch, but I feel that this could definitely be nightmare-inducing for the little ones.  Just a warning.
B000001ELL|4.0|I am a huge Make-up era Kiss fan and as such I am not sure what all of the other fans gripe about this album for. First of all, this is Not a Disco album. Sure \\"I Was Made For Loving You\\" has disco rhythms in it but you cannot categorize an entire album based on one song, especially when it was actually quite good. It was not straight forward disco but a combination of Disco/Rock. Second, yes this album and unmasked do not rock as hard as say Love Gun or Destroyer, but that does not make them bad, especially one star bad. Just because and album is different does not make it bad. In the end Dynasty and Unmasked are good albums with catchy songs and great melodies by the Ace and a definite 4 1/2 stars!!!
B001GCUER0|5.0|What can I say?  I'm a maddict.  Despite facing a looming deadline from my editor, I sat and watched the entire second season in 4 days -- one disc per day.  I started watching the series during the middle of season two and so did not want to watch things out of order and waited breathlessly for season 2 to come out on DVD.  It's the best television since the glory days of MASH, the Odd Couple, Bob Newhart, etc. etc.  Love, love, love Mad Men.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|I liked this movie very much. It's a great combination of the cerebral and the emotive. Will Ferrell shows that he can be something other than a dork (who would have thought), and Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman are predictably professional and terrific. Maggie Gyllenhaal is believable and appealing as the love interest. The suspense is managed well, and from a meta-fictional point of view, the film is thought-provoking (if maybe a little too obvious about its aspirations in this direction).    I wonder: Did Zach Helm, the writer, read that wonderful children's book \\"Harold and His Purple Crayon\\" (and its sequels)? I ask because the main character's name is Harold, and this movie seems to be a kind of fictional, filmic exploration of what would happen if someone really could write a world, if imagination could in fact change the contours of reality.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Love the Barbie case, love the episode guide, love the neat storage format, love it all!  It's amazing to see how much of the show has been cut from the ABC Family Channel re-runs, and no commercials is a blissful bonus.
0786856297|5.0|I just finished reading 'The Lightning Thief' today and must say that I enjoyed this book a great deal.  I like the fact that this book can appeal to a broader audience as I am in my early twenties and enjoyed the book.  It was my decision to purchase this book after seeing all the rave reviews by past readers.  Also, the fact that the movie for this book comes out in February of 2010.  I decided to give it try.  This book has everything: action, comedy, sadness, light-heartedness.  Also, it taught me a few things in Greek mythology that I didn't know while refreshing my memory on things I did know.  I like the fact that Rick Riordan modernized the gods to fit in with our current society.  I am officially a Percy Jackson and the Olympians fan and I intend to buy and read the rest of the series.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this set for my husband and he RAVES about it!  It's one of the best gifts I've gotten him.  I've watched bits and pieces and I think the picture and sound quality is phenomenal.  This is a great gift for the man in your life.  I can't see any guy not loving this set.  It's a no brainer.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|Customers beware   DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER   I never received this order and have not been compensated
1416914307|5.0|I loved CoB and CoA..but so far, CoG is the best!  I fell in love with Jace a long while ago and it broke my heart to see him hurt.  Everything ends up perfectly, but not in a \\"Everything is just so perfect I think I'll puke\\"way,  but a heartaching, beautiful, mesmerizing way.  The ending was a little obvious, but Cassie pulled it through in a way no others could have.  I love Harry Potter and Da vinci Code..all of them..but the Mortal Instruments are the best!  The characters are themselves unlike some sequels where character experience a major change nobody can keep up with.  So I highly recommend this~
0316017922|5.0|After \\"Blink\\" (his past book) I never thought he could improve that! Leave aside the fascinating stories about famous people and the correspondant explanations of their success, brilliantly described in this masterpiece (Bill Gates, The Beatles, Hockey players, etc.)... or the wonderful description of why high IQ's mean little more than nothing in predicting anyone's success... or the delicious interpretation of why Asian students stand out in math at school... Mr. Gladwell, IMHO, really becomes one of my top 5 favorite contemporary writters by giving us the formula (yes, a kind of a method!) to become \\"experts\\" in any given filed of our choice... the \\"10,000 hours\\" element...    Want to find out what it means? don't think twice... make yourself a favor (and to your children!) and buy this book. Guaranteed.
B001L70C7M|5.0|This is my favorite Fleetwood Mac album, though Rumors is close.  This is also the best sounding of all of the wonderful MFSL records.  The combination is magic.  Seduce that girl this time!  This is the record to do it by.
B0018HQBXY|5.0|anything by the  beegees  is worth listening too. every song is a hit
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Awesome album with outstanding production and great songs... sounds a lot like Def Leppard thanks to Robert Mutt Lange... For Def Leppard and obviously Nickelback fans.
0316017922|1.0|Gladwell makes the proposition that outsized success is due to luck, not intelligence, hard work, and good judgemnt. He cites a number of examples to which I take exception.  First, Bil Gates was lucky to have access to computing time at an early age. Wrong!  He had the benefit of good parenting. His well educted parents, who valued education and nurtured their precocious son, made sure he had the best educational environment in which to grow up. It should come as no surprise that he attended a school funded by parents who shared the same value system.  The parents provided the environment and resources. He provided the rest.  Second, he cites Richard Flom and other founders of prestigious law firms in New York as being \\"in the right place at the right time\\" -- after they were discriminated against by the WASP establishment. His proof of the later statement came from the recollecton of a conversation Flom had in a job interview. His own analysis shows the role their parents played.  All immegrated to this country without advantage and started at the bottom. The common threads included a strong family structure where all members (husbands, wives, and children) worked together for the familly's well being and placed a hgh value on educaation.  The parents saw how an education would significantly enhance their children's probbility of future success.  So it should be no surprise that most went to college and often graducate school after that. Gladwell even cites interviews of elderly parents along with the \\"family tree\\" of their professions: doctor, lawyer, doctor, doctor, lawyer, etc. Flom and his contemporaries had the benefit of good parenting. Oh, by the way the Beatles were lucky too-- according to Gladwell.  They took a gig in Germany to play extensively in the clubs there. That's where they got good, he said. The decision to go was not luck. It was a prudent investment of their time in developing their human capital. I could go on with more examples, but will not. In his closing interview, Gladwell admits he was on a mission to destroy the American notion of how people succeed greatly. It's not you, but rather a matter of luck -- and you are likely to be a victim of racism or other form of discrimination to boot. By choosing outliers(the most successful of the successful), he sets up a straw man and knocks it down. Unfortunately, he only proves that good parenting, investing in our own human capital, and good judgement can pay hugh dividends. I refer him and any readers to Charlie Munger's concept of lollapaloosa effects in investing. That is what happens when a number of favorable factors occur in the same place at the same time which can coalesce into \\"outlier\\" success.  Nothing can be more American.
6305558167|1.0|After seeing Mists of Avalon, I wanted to watch another Arthurian tale that I hadn't seen before. After looking online, I choose Excalibur because it received high reviews on a couple different websites for being a good movie and for being accurate to the legend. With all the thumbs-up it was getting, I expected a really good movie. A good movie was not what I got.    If there was one word in the English language to describe this travesty -- a word that could be used in mixed company, at least --  that word would be \\"AWKWARD.\\" The entire movie is just -- oh, so awkward. There is an awkward, awkward dance by Igrayne at the beginning. Now, to be fair, the poor woman WAS ordered to dance in front of smelly men (I can only imagine, given that they've just come in after pillaging and killing!) and looks a little shell-shocked, but I don't think that \\"someone is holding a gun to your forehead and orders you to bust a move\\" was in the script's description of the dance. It is much like watching your grandmother do Carmen Electrica's Stripperaerobics.    Somehow, this strange \\"dance\\" turns Uther on and leads to the most awkward love scene featuring a knight. Now, I've seen a fair amount of knights-in-shining-armor movies and so from what I have gathered, it is not impossible for knights to remove said shining armor. In fact, in times of love-making and general doin'-it-on-the-floor, removing the armor is strongly recommended. Apparently, \\"strongly recommended\\" doesn't mean \\"mandatory\\" so good ol' Uther left on THE ENTIRE SUIT including the helmet. And proceeded to do it very near to a ridiculously symbolic fire, which just so happened to be next to little girl Morgana's bed. Did I mention that the sevenish-year-old is awake and watching them have sex? And that Uther totally makes eye contact? Awwwkward. (This experience must have significantly scarred Morgana because as an adult, she dressed like a backup dancer in an early Madonna video. Oh, plus that whole 'sex with her brother' thing.)    I busted a gut laughing at the dramatic \\"tension-filled\\" chase scene between Uther and some dudes trying to kill him -- clunk-clunk-clunk goes the armor as they slowly waddle through a muddy river in hot pursuit. Truly, it was a nail biting moment.    Merlin is whacked-out crazy-go-nuts. This movie is, by all intentions, not *supposed* to be a knock-off of Monty Python's Holy Grail. Apparently, no one ever told Nicol Williamson because he does buggy eyes, crazy intonations, pulls ridiculous faces, and just generally is over the top. Which would be hilarious in a movie that is not supposed to be serious.    From this movie's portrayal, I am also forced to conclude that Arthur was mentally handicapped or at least developmentally delayed. It's pretty evident in that first scene we see of him as a teen. This adds an interesting dimension to the age old tale, but I don't think that is what the film intended to communicate.    This movie is a complete waste of 2 hours, unless you have good wine and good friends to watch with you. Snarking on the movie by yourself isn't all that much fun and snark is truly the only bit of enjoyment you'd get out of this hot mess.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I never heard of Watchmen before I saw this movie. From overall reviews, it only gets 3.5 stars. I'm so fortunate to give this movie a try. It has great character builiding (just like the Sin City movie), great action, little comedy but more serious conflicted superheroes (just like the Dark Knight and Spiderman 3). The actors are very good in delivering the characters, you can feel the pure kindness, pure anger, pure brutality , etc.  The story is crisp and original, very smart the way the movie bring us to think about which side we are on, peace? murder? it's awesome. There's some little romance, too. The only flaw is the soundtrack picks, it's really weird and giving you a depressing feeling. Everything else is a geat total package. I don't understand why other people hating this movie so much while there are a lot more much lower quality and morale, darker, way gorier and stupider movies out there. I f they give this movie 1 star, they might want to give others like minus 5 star, may be.... I don't know, at least I think this movie is great. If you like Sin City, the Dark knight, here is a great one for you. A more realistic superhero movie.    Thanks

B001DHXT6G|5.0|Star trek is resurrected once again.  I love the remastered versions, and I should know.  I own all the originals.  My favs are the beauty passes of the Enterprise with ringed planets, and the different angles of the beauty passes.    I still haven't watched all the episodes yet, so I'm sure some surprises are in store.      If you are a Star Trek fan, this is a must have!!
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer is absolutely amazing in this live concert. Every song is great and he really sounds phenomenal..buy this!
B00273D43I|5.0|I have to admit that I hated this album when I first heard it all those years ago as I am in general not a fan of the hip hop percussive sound of tracks like \\"Jam\\" and I found that I liked the slower tracks like the incredibly good \\"Remember the Time\\", \\"Heal the World\\", \\"Black Or White\\" and \\"Will You Be There\\" a lot better but I realise now that Michael and indeed this album was just ahead of its time and as Michael was always a pioneering sort of artist it wasn't that the album was bad but that I wasn't ready for it.  I know that I can say that now as listening to this wonderful mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of the album I can tell that this is inspired stuff.  This album would be a hit if it were released today and that tells me that Michael's work on this album has inspired many a current musician's sound even to this day.  By virtually filling up all the space on this cd you know you are getting value for money and I find that the tracks actually have a great flow to them.  This album has aged very well for me and sounds fresh and a whole lot more enjoyable to me today than it did the first time I heard it when it first came out.  This mlps version is a treat for fans as it has an excellently remastered sound quality and the mlps design is one of the best that I've seen coming in very good quality cardboard and assembly.  There is also a 22 page glossy colour booklet with all the lyrics plus photos of Michael with the Thai dancers from the \\"Black Or White\\" video and with Eddie Murphy and Iman from the \\"Remember the Time\\" video as well as another 16 page black and white booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  It's like I'm listening to a whole new album and I can see this one eventually taking over from \\"Bad\\" as my all-time favourite Michael Jackson album.  This mlps version of \\"Dangerous\\" is probably the best version of the album that is currently out there and is certainly worth the upgrade even if just for the beautiful mlps design in itself.<br /><br />Great mlps design, great sound quality and excellent content that has aged very well makes this version of \\"Dangerous\\" very highly recommended!t mlps design, great sound quality and excellent content that has aged very well makes this version of \\"Dangerous\\" very highly recommended!
1416972242|2.0|I don't have a good track record with this series. I read the first one when it was first released and absolutely HATED the twist at the end. It ruined the book for me and hence I never prgressed with the series.<br /><br />However, one of my friends has been bugging me to finish the series for ages, so I finally got my act together and started them again.<br /><br />I find Clare's writing to be a little too flowery for my tastes. There is just so much unnecessary description - towards the end I was just reading the dialogue and skimming all the description in between. It doesn't really add to the story at all. Actually I skimmed probably 1/4 of this book, that was mainly just so I could finish it instead of reading a couple of pages from time to time.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|I love The Next Generation but I had never purchased any of the individual season DVD sets.  I thought it would be nicer to have the entire series in one neatly packaged box set rather than deal with all seven seasons on their own.  I was warned of the general \\"cheap\\" quality of the production of this set before I bought it but I took the plunge anyway.  And now I'm here to say, avoid this set if you can.      Other reviewers speak the truth when they say that the packaging is low-grade.   I can live with that most of the time, (the set still looks nice on my shelf at least) but what I didn't expect out of this set was to have episodes that wouldn't play!!  I started having disc play back troubles right from the beginning.  Sometimes when I would hit \\"engage\\" on the menu to start the episode the screen will just freeze and never start playing.  I t does this on both of my DVD players.  When I try to play the episode on my computer it will randomly skip large segments and give me an \\"attempting to skip over damaged area\\" error.      Here is a list of all the episodes that are \\"damaged\\" in my set:    107 - Where No One has Gone Before  108 - Justice  111 - Haven  112 - The Big Goodbye  211 - Contagion  214 - The Icarus Factor  306 - Booby Trap  502 - Darmok  517 - The Outcast  707 - Dark Page    From what I understand, I'm in the minority as far as having this much disc trouble, that's why  I still gave this set three stars.  Just know that you are taking a chance buying this set.

B00000K19E|5.0|Should the AFI Top 100 Movies Ever list be updated anytime soon, you can be sure that this film will rank among the top 50.  I can't find anything not to like and even watching this again 10 years after its release it is still an excellent film.  The whole storyline and premise is so intriquing, acting so good and overall cinematography so excellent that this would be a hit even if it was released today.  This dvd is also very good as far as standard formats go with an excellent sound quality coming in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and the picture quality is very good indeed.  The special features has a very good making of documentary and I appreciated the whole white rabbit feature as well.  I am at a loss to think of anything bad to say about this standard dvd format version of this great film.  It'll be interesting to see just how much better the Blu-ray version is as this standard version is already so good.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!<br /><br />Updated 16 Sep 2011:<br /><br />Amazon won't let me do this separately so I'll have to append this here.  The Digibook Blu-ray release of this great film is real treat for fans.  This picture quality is excellent in 1080p and the sound quality is also very good although I personally would have preferred DTS HD MA but this Dolby TrueHD is still pretty good.  I've always had a soft spot for digibooks and so this already makes for me a worthy double-dip and upgrade from the standard dvd I reviewed above.  The special feature making-of documentaries are extensive and the very long audio soundtrack of a selection of tunes from the movie is also a nice treat.  The Prodigy and Rage Against The Machine tracks are not here but we do get a video of Marilyn Manson's \\"Rock Is Dead\\".<br /><br />Very, very highly recommended!
0618918248|5.0|What an amazing book. I've read so many atheist titles like god is not great\\" and \\"the end of faith\\" but this one finds so many new angles to argue from. Very refreshing. What is especially pleasing is that Dawkins strong scientific background gives the book a a distinct flavor among the atheist titles. Whereas Hitchens has a literary taste and sam harris a socio-political one, The God Delusion has an almost a Sagan-Hawking feel to it that is sure to perplex (Not to say that Dawkins is at their level but certainly not far from it either)
0790729644|5.0|I was in the mood for a nice western so I decided to watch Unforgiven. I first browsed the Amazon reviews as usual in order to decrease my chances of wasting my time on a movie I might wind up being disappointed in. I was not disappointed. The film caught me off guard.     It gripped my attention within the first few minutes. The next thing I know, I was mainly focused on the concept of \\"the good guys hunting down the bad guys for justice\\" and I was satisfied with this concept as the film unfolded. As the film developed, I began to realize that this movie was not simply about good vs. evil or bad guys against good guys. Matter-of-fact, I really couldn't call anyone good or bad. It was more about a man...a man with an interesting past that fully comes to light by the end of the movie. It was a nice twist for me and I really enjoyed it. Great acting and great story.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|a fantastic game. it blends strategy, luck, and player vs. player gameplay really well. it's very well-designed. you may have perfect strategy, but the factor of luck the dice provides may slow your plans. or you may have a poor strategy, but the dice can be on your side. the randomization makes the game different everytime.    you win by getting 10 points from building different structures and/or getting bonus victory points. building requires resources which are gained by the lucky roll of the 2 dice. for any of your buildings that are touching the number that was rolled, you get those resource cards to add to your hand. 6s and 8s are statistically the most common numbers rolled, besides 7s.  2s and 12s, on the other hand, are the hardest to roll, so setting up around good numbers at the beginning is important. when a 7 is rolled, the roller can move the robber onto a number on the board which will make that part of the board not produce resources until the robber is moved elsewhere. it also means the roller can steal a resource card from 1 of the other players that has buildings touching that part of the board. and if anybody has 8 or more cards must lose half of their resource cards too. and of course 7 is statistically the most common # rolled, so the game can be a rollercoaster. and finally, during your turn, you can trade your resource cards 4 to 1 of the same type, or 3 to 1 or 2 to 1 depending on what trading port you have access too. better yet, you can trade with other players on your turn too. what's cool about that is the players get to name the terms. for example, you can say \\"i'll give you 1 card for 2 of your cards.\\" the strategy is simple but greatly variable.    when you get used to the game, try the [[ASIN:B000W7I7EW Catan:  Cities & Knights Expansion]], which adds many more dimensions that make it even more fun. the way the game is designed leaves it open to virtually unlimited expansion, even your own.
0060574216|5.0|I would recommend this book  to either sex,married or unmarried, regardless of age. It is a great aid to understanding the opposite sex and improving relations and is presented in entertaining way.
B001OQCV9M|3.0|It is 2002 and Julie is approaching her thirtieth year with a feeling of emptiness.  Desperate for something to fill her life, she decides to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook and blog about her culinary adventures.  Interspersed with Julie's scenes, we see glimpses of Julia Child's life in Paris forty years earlier as she finds her niche in the culinary world.<br /><br />If you love cooking and/or Julia Child you will love this movie based  on Julie Powell's blog.  For me, cooking is a tedious chore and I don't share their passion for the kitchen stove. That said, Meryl Streep does a wonderful job playing the joyful Julia, her scenes in Paris are fun, and the movie would have been a lot better if it was just about her.  Amy Adams is bland as the young New Yorker who idolizes Julia and her story seemed pointless.  I still don't know why she thought following someone else's recipes was so noteworthy (or interesting).<br /><br />Recommended for cooking fans.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Gran Torino is slated to be Clint Eastwood's final acting role, announcing plans on a career move seated behind the camera in directing films rather than staring in them.  Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski is a far cry from his man with no name spagetti western and Dirty Harry days, while retaining the gruff razor's edge toughness the actor is noted for.   Sitting on his porch like the last Dinasaur attempting to retain what little remains of his declining domain, Korean War vet Walt drinks Pabsts Blue Ribbon Beer and smokes Lucy Strikes disgusted by the changes which have taken place in his once blue collar inner city neighborhood.  Eastwod winds up mentoring his young Korean neighbor after the boy's failed attempt at stealing Walt's vintage 1972 Gran Torino as part of a gang initiation.  This film is the perfect curtain call for Eastwood's acting career and should go down as one of his best performances.
0743297334|2.0|A boring book about the empty lives of empty people. It would have been more interesting if they were contrasted with some other type. The book my be historically important for the ground it broke at the time it was written, but today your reading time is better spent elsewhere.
1401300529|3.0|David Halberstam's The Coldest Winter is a masterfully written book.  It reads easily about a myriad of complex situations.  David is at his best when he discusses the interpersonal relations which take up a lot of the book.    However, it should be noted that the author has a definite liberal perspective.  Two examples stand out.  From Halberstam's description of the pressures leading up to the war, it sounds as though the major cause of the war was the misunderstandings between the commmunist nations and the U.S.  While it is true that the communist nations did not expect the U.S. to join militarily with South Korea and the U.S. did not expect a North Korean attack, the primary cause of the war was the North Koreans invading the south.  I do not believe it was a symmetric misunderstanding, but a communist military invasion.    Second, Halberstam suggests that Secretary of State Dean Acheson, New Deal political hero author of many early cold war American policies, deserves more credit than Ronald Reagan for ending the reign of the USSR.  While Acheson may have set in place many of the policies for the cold war, this is an odd claim.    There also seems to be a general tendency to explain conservative/Republican views of the time as \\"far right\\" but to portray liberal/Democratic views as common sense.  However, Halberstam is clearly willing to point out flaws in both Democrats and Republicans.    In any case it's an excellent book for what it is, but the reader should be aware of the perspective of the author.
1556900236|3.0|The narration of the book itself was great.  It brought the book to life.  The tapes were used (from a library)and the sound/volume got louder and softer without anyone touching anything.  There were a few parts that were so soft that you couldn't hear anything. That was disappointing.
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|Donny, \\"The Jew Bear\\" Donowitz stalks out of the tunnel wearing a necklace full of German dogtags. But it's the baseball bat at his side that draws my eyes, as he uses it to jab at the Iron Cross of a Whermacht sergeant. \\"You win that for killing Jews?\\" he snarls.<br /><br />\\"For bravery,\\" answers the man.<br /><br />\\"That's a nice touch,\\" I thought as the bat beats him to death. Made him more human than his own executioner, come to think of it. The Jew Bear is a pretty-looking, but pretty thin character.<br /><br />So goes *Inglourious Basterds*, a \\"macaroni combat\\" film full of nice touches and beautiful faces. Director/writer Quentin Tarantino has stepped out of the comfortable shoes of `70's exploitation films to tackle the 1940's. The result is an enjoyable, if odd attack on the subject of World War II.<br /><br />To my surprise, *Inglourious Basterds* is neither particularly violent nor particularly bloody. There is no nudity and hardly any four-letter words. What I would consider a \\"soft R\\". There are a few brief shootouts, plus a climax reminiscent of both [[ASIN:B00005K3NR Carrie]] and [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Raiders of the Lost Ark]]. Movie virgins might shudder at a few scenes of knife play. But for dirty old film fans like me, it's soft-core.<br /><br />Don't mistake this for a new leaf. Tarantino presents another vengeful exploitation movie--awash in swastikas, set pieces, and sexy ladies. It includes anachronistic music, graphic overlays to point out major characters, spotty narration--even Mike Meyers in another outlandish role as an outlandish Briton.<br /><br />Thus, *Inglourious* is not Quentin's [[ASIN:B00001ZWUS Saving Private Ryan]]. Think [[ASIN:B00005JMEW Kill Bill]] meets [[ASIN:B00004RF9L Kelly's Heroes]], only not as compelling as either.<br /><br />Far from the \\"more mature\\" film as his backers call it, Quentin's film struck me as shallow. The Basterds trade characters for caricatures, conflict for clich&eacute;'s. It doesn't help that Tarantino splices two stories into the space of one, leaving some hefty gaps in the story.<br /><br />But as mise-en-scene (that's French for \\"setting in scene\\" as in \\"kill us some Nazis\\"), Inglourious Basterds impressed me. Tarantino hasn't lost his knack for framing, even as the scenes bolt between two plots. There's never a frumpy costume nor an ornament out of place. Quentin also brings back his *Kill Bill* cinematographer Robert Richardsen. Only this time, they avoid the fancy camera work of previous films: favoring fixed cameras, quantities of cuts, and close-ups. The film quality and colors look sharper than ever.<br /><br />So does the acting. There's hardly a puddle of depth to any character, but they are played as masterfully as a cartoon can get. Already, Christoph Waltz wins praise for his diplomatically demonic role as SS Colonel Landa. His character keeps up the sinister charm for so long that it's a genuine shock whenever he does anything else. And Brad Pitt's Aldo Raines, while being the most hackneyed caricature in Quentin cinema (next to Meyer's General Fenech), gives a pitch-perfect performance as a sociopathic redneck out to kill hizzself some Nat-zies. My quiet favorite, though, was Daniel Bruhl as Fredrick Zoller--a kind of Nazi Audie Murphy. Tarantino deserves further credit too, for these characters and their scene-edible dialogue.<br /><br />Indeed, the best tension in the film comes in the personal confrontations. It is ridiculous how often our heroes meet with suspicious interrogators. But I found my eyes averting and my seat squirming as the cold-eyed enemy waits for his answer.<br /><br />I enjoyed my time in the theater--in fact, I was the only one who seemed to be laughing out loud at the jokes. But I gotta tell you the truth... in some respects this film is less enjoyable than [[ASIN:B000R7HY0K Death Proof]].<br /><br />Not that I thought *Death Proof* was a bad film. While it had way too much fat, it was still recognizably Tarantino, with histhemes, characters, and plot. *Inglourious Basterds*, on the other hand, tries to be a Tarantino film. As Review Lover points out (16 August review), the Quentin style feels like it has come off an assembly line to fill an order.<br /><br />Partly because it's too self-referential. Julie Dreyfus returns from *Kill Bill* as a Nazi mistress. Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson return to lend their voices. The film's central antagonist feels like it was written with Tim Roth in mind (though the actor does not appear). While the leading lady looks like a French version of The Bride. Then there are the numerous fourth-wall references to nitrate film, film projection, and film making, as the heart of the story beats inside of a movie theater within the movie.<br /><br />Self-reference can fall flat on its face for me, as it does with [[ASIN:B00003CY67 Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]. Fortunately, Tarantino is too smooth to stumble like that. Otherwise, the big problem is that Tarantino tries to tell too much story into too little space.<br /><br />The much touted female characters thus struck me as pretty faces. I think Diane Kruger and Melanie Laurent offer a lot of talent and potential. Especially Laurent as a 1940's Beatrix Kiddo, wielding film instead of swords. But they just aren't given enough role for my tastes.<br /><br />Men don't often do much better. The Jew Bear, interesting in idea and appearance is, plays one-note. Which is more than can be said for his no-note companions. The eponymous Basterds are absent throughout most of their own film. In contrast stands Michael Fassbender, who schmoozed me as the suave-but-short-tempered Lt. Hicox. His brief time on screen has a measurable impact on the story, something that should have been the case with many other characters.<br /><br />Ultimately, this movie feels like it should have been broken up into two Volumes, or expanded to the runtime of Grindhouse. Tarantino has so much to show and to say that by presenting Inglourious Basterds as is, he cheats me as much as he cheats himself..

0307266303|3.0|I originally wrote a review after seeing the author on 'The Daily Show', before I had read the book.  The impression I got from that interview was that the book was primarily about the legendary Tarahumara, and to quote from the Amazon.com review the author was claiming 'Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence.' The reason I got that impression is because that is what McDougall said on the show. A couple people commented that I was mistaken but I'm pretty sure that's what I heard, and it definitely made my b.s. sensors go on high alert.<br /><br />One commenter stated that I had no business reviewing a book I hadn't read and I found it hard to argue with that. So I figured what the heck, the book is about at least three things I'm interested in, i.e. trail running, the Tarahumara, and Mexico so what do I have to lose?<br /><br />I found the book fairly compelling for the first half of it, before the author's hyperbolic style started wearing me down. Not to say I had to force myself to finish it, far from it, just that the initial fascination did fade. What I liked about the book is that overall it was an entertaining read, especially considering the subject which can't be that easy to write about. McDougall actually managed to make the '94 Leadville 100 and the Copper Canyon races interesting and even suspenseful to read about.  I would have defied anyone to make reporting on an ultradistance running race entertaining but he did.<br /><br />The book is a decent history of distance and ultradistance running in modern times and particularly the U.S. It also mentions several fascinating and obscure distance running feats throughout recorded history. His explorations of the theories that humans may have evolved specifically to run and that shoes may cause muscle atrophy in the feet are also quite interesting, if not totally convincing.<br /><br />Despite what I was expecting from his Daily Show appearance the book is not primarily about the Tarahumara. There is no study of their running style, beyond the old landing on the ball of the feet versus the heel argument. And of course running in sandals as opposed to cushioned running shoes. Even though he has connections with actuall Tarahumara the author opts instead to use the American ex-pat Caballo Blanco as his resource.<br /><br />The group of American runners they got to show for the Copper Canyon race were a pretty eccentric bunch, and their biographies were interesting enough. I felt McDougall could have been more disapproving of the two neo-beatnik college kids black out drinking habits but that would have gone against the gonzo vibe he was trying to maintain. The adventure in the desert where they went running without bringing along water was just retarded.  Until I saw, again on the Daily Show, that Mexico has govt. health care I thought Caballo Blanco's decision to give up everything to relocate to Mexico to become a full time trail runner was unbalanced and reckless, but now I think he might be on to something.<br /><br />I already mentioned the authors' hyperbolic style. Nearly every run, race or drive in Mexico is presented as death defying. If you go for a run in the desert and neglect to bring water that isn't death defying, its just plain stupid. If you're leading a run in the desert over trails your companions who don't have water have never been on before and you leave them behind then you're being a dick, and maybe even criminally negligent.<br /><br />Last, there is a definite anti-technology or Luddite bent being presented in the book. Before corrupting modern influences such as processed foods and automobiles the Tarahumara all lived to be over 100 and could run 100 miles a day until the day they died. Despite an affinity for tobacco and booze (as an aside anyone remember Hunter S. Thompson's coverage of the marathon in Hawaii? He and his buddies offered beer and smokes to the racers as they went by. The Tarahumara would have been his kind of runners). Shoes are certainly portrayed as being harmful, particularly running shoes. Though there wasn't enough data presented to make the case I'm willing to consider it (like McDougall I'm a person who has felt compelled to run but has struggled to be able to do so, and found orthotics and motion control shoes to be of no help) but what about the effects of asphalt and concrete? Plus, going barefoot isn't an option for most of us who have to go to work and such, or live in cities with all kinds of nasty things to step on. So how about a middle path? That isn't much discussed.<br /><br />In conclusion, I give the book four stars for readability, and two stars the shortcomings I have mentioned, for an average of three. With the caveat that if you are interested in trail running or the history of distance running I would recommend this book as an entertaining and thought provoking read.<br /><br />My original review, written before I read the book and based on my impression of the authors' appearance on the Daily Show. Which makes less sense after actually having read the book but I'll include it nonetheless:<br /><br />After hearing some of McDougall's claims on the 'Daily Show' I feel the need to put in my two cents worth. About 25 years ago I read a book about a people called the Hunza in Pakistan who supposedly lived to be 120 on average because they were vegetarians and practiced a form of yoga and meditation. I bought it hook line and sinker. I also read a lot of other dubious parapsychological material that I accepted as possible.<br />Among the fantastic books I read were those by Tom Brown, who claimed to have been taught hunting and gathering skills by an Apache. In New Jersey. I had my younger brother read a story of his about him punching his way through a cinder block wall to kick butt on some poachers and my brother said \\"Is this guy full of 'crap' or what?\\" A light bulb went off for me, and I realized you can't believe everything you read.<br />McDougall claims that the Tarahumara are 'immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence' and that they can run 400 miles at a stretch. No cancer, heart problems etc. He portrays them as nearly immortal superhumans. According to the 2008 Nat. Geo. article about them they are plagued by high blood pressure, alcoholism and drug abuse, malnutrition, diabetes and obesity. I was quite disappointed that Jon Stewart didn't question some of his absurd claims.<br />I do agree that humans were 'Born To Run'. Peoples from the Algonquin to the Kung Bushmen have been reported to be able to travel up to 100 miles in a day doing a sort of double time, 6-8 mile an hour jog by European observers. Humans are also able to do this efficiently, not burning more calories than they can get by wearing down game animals in this way.<br />McDougall may have written an entertaining tale, but that does not excuse the reckless and patently false claims he is making. What's more the Tarahumara are not a 'lost' tribe, they have been in contact with European culture for centuries. 15 years ago they were in the media because running was being substituted by hitch hiking as a means of travel. Nor are they pacifists, there are historical accounts of them violently resisting colonization.<br />Most people are not runners, yet many people live into their 80's and 90's.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|The picture is extremely shoddy in this Blu-Ray release! Avoid like the plague, so the studio gets the idea! What the heck is the studio doing releasing this atrocious transfer on BD when the movie itself is such a great one? Unbelievable! A movie like this should have a flawless transfer! Argh!
078322737X|5.0|Having lived as a teenager in the 50's, I can definitely relate to this movie.  It's a great depiction of what life was really like back in those days.  The movie stirs up a lot of happy memories for me of the good ole days when you enjoyed the simpler things in life and friends really meant something to you.  The choice of cast members is great, the music is great and the story-line is great.  I never get tired of watching this movie.
0307266303|4.0|Born to Run is a very interesting story of a trible of Mexican's that have survived and thrived by shunning the rest of the world and living thier lives in peace. The book has a cast of characters out of a Jimmy Buffet Song,  I especially like the tales of Barefoot Ted.  The tales of the gang of Ultra-Marathoners intersperced with author's and the Tarahumara stories provided the readers with multiple levels of plot and story line.  A very entertaining read.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Finally! A new Black Sabbath album. IMO this is the best line up Sabbath ever had. Dio is 66 and still has an amazing voice. The album is different than the 3 presious albums w/Dio. I would say it is a mix of Dehumanizer and Cross Purposes with more Dio (the band) type lyrics than Sabbath. Tony still has riffs like no one else. I think this is easily some of Geezer's best bass work. The album moves from slow to mid pace through out. Definitely more doomy and dramatic. I can only hope they continue making albums because this does not sound tired at all. Each of the 4 Dio era albums are really different fron one another and this one is just a logical progression of Dehumanizer. A great release for 2009! Stand out track is Breaking Into Heaven - just epic sounding!

0316067598|2.0|My father fought in Vietnam as a Marine, and I am proud of anything any member of our armed forces does for our country. My biggest regret in life - bar none - is never having served.    That said, this book is filled with so much bragadocio and bravado from the author, I don't know what to believe and what not to believe. His \\"I am the best/Texas is the best/Navy Seals are the best\\" arrogance turned me off to what is an incredible story. Yet, what type of crack unit sits in hiding on a hillside cracking jokes with one another, breaking the silence?     I believe one can be patriotic and appreciative while still being open-minded and critical. I'd like to think I am both, and for that reason can't recommend this book. I've read dozens of first-person war accounts, and I have to say this is the only one whose author turned me off.
1400082773|5.0|There is no way around expressing that this is a remarkably well-written memoir. Per the title, the author, Barack \\"Barrry\\" Obama, tells not only his life story, but also focuses on the subject of race in America. He tells his personal history as well as the history of American's race relations and understanding through the eyes of a biracial boy-turned man, coming of age in the late 20th Century.<br /><br />Throughout his life, it's apparent Obama has commanded attention through his intelligence, good nature, handsome being, and strong family background. This tale is as much about his Midwestern-born white mother and grandparents, \\"Gramps\\" and \\"Toot,\\" as it is about his biological Kenyan-born father. It's still remarkable to comprehend that this narrator, given his roots, eventually becomes the elected 44th President of the United States.<br /><br />I enjoyed listening to the narration of this story by the author. He unabashedly recalls both events and conversations of his youth, and without fear or tiresome, guarded political motivations. He expresses true accounts of his coming of age and the understanding of his heritage. And I particularly enjoyed Obama's recollection of his journey to \\"Home Squared,\\" when he visited Kenya for the first time and related my own first visit to this fascinating country. Every American, black or white, can't help but learn about the role of race plays in a community when traveling the streets of Nairobi or the red dirt roads of the Western Provence.<br /><br />Please read (or listen to) this book. Love him or loathe him, at least get to know him. This book commands great respect and I give it my highest recommendation.<br /><br />Michele Cozzens is the author of A Line Between Friends and It's Not Your Mother's Bridge Club.
B00064VR0W|5.0|I can't believe this is his first time playing at royal albert hall.His voice has not changed over the years and this concert is a clever mix of classic Rod Stewart hits as well as some older 40's and 50's redone by Rod.Also there is a couple of duets that are fantastic plus the old friend of Rods, Ronnie Woods of the Rolling Stones makes an appearence on a couple of songs.I highly recommend this even if you are not a big Rod Stewart fan.Very entertaining to say the least !!!!!!
1587880784|3.0|Hmmm... I'll be honest - I've never been able to make it through this film from beginning to end, I ALWAYS fall asleep even though I admit that it's a fantastically made film.  So I thought, surely the book will fill me in on everything I always sleep through (the part I enjoy the most is HAL) but since I had a long road trip for work ahead of me I picked up the audiobook.<br /><br />I'll admit that I'm not big on Science Fiction other then a handful of novels (Ender's Game, Day of the Trifids etc).  Once I made it past the monkey people in the beginning, I was okay with the dude going to the moon (though the technical detail started making me nod off I prevailed) then on to our dear astronauts headed to Saturn with HAL in tow.  I was happy as could be with that part.  But once we moved on beyond it... it was an uphill battle to the end.  I know that the idea and concept were amazing, the writing was beautiful, but I had to struggle through every last bit of it.  I don't think I could have actually read the book, had it not been on my IPOD I think I would have probably lost interest.<br /><br />I can see why people love this book.  And I appreciate it for all that it is... but I can't for the life of me say that I really enjoyed it as much as everyone else seems to.  Though the book WAS written at the same time as Kubrick was filming the movie, the book will enlighten the reader (or listener) on many of the parts of the film that leave the viewer of the film scratching their head.<br /><br />For those interested in the Audiobook quality - the audiobook does include the intro, narrated by Mr. Arthur C Clark himself.  The book is read by a very skilled and clear reader without an overbearing accent (so many of them do) and I couldn't have been any happier with the quality of the recording and would recommend it to anyone interested in the story.
0375413405|5.0|My Rubachem review of Mastering the Art of French Cooking is that it's a huge help for even beginners and that's no scam!  Most books are for expert chefs but this is easy to understand.  The movie is also awesome!!
B00192IV0O|4.0|I love this cd.  I am a BEPs fan, however I have never purchased one of their cds.  This one is awesome for getting you moving, especially while driving.  I am a huge house/dance music fan, and this cd is just that.  I am also really into lyrics, however that is not what I want out of this cd.  What I want from this cd is to make me dance and move in my seat while I'm driving to work in the morning or getting ready to hangout.  This cd gets you in the mood for hanging out and dancing.  Every cd is not going to be this deep, make you go hmm, type of cd.  Every artist has to venture out and stray from the tried and true to keep it interesting for them.  Give BEPs a break, this cd is fun and its a perfect summer jammin cd.  That's it, end of story.
0765356147|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed how well composed the plot line is as Sanderson ties details from the entire serious into one fantastic ending.  Very much a good read.
B0028K3192|4.0|Well finally my baby Maxwell is back and doing it big again.  I am a true, true Maxwell fan.  As a matter of fact he's coming to town on Sept 26 and I spent $100 on the ticket to see him.  He puts on an awesome concert and I'm looking forward to seeing him perform the new songs from this cd.  Ok so let's get this out of the way now, Is this cd compariable to some of his other work?  The answer would be No.  But is this cd good on its on merit?  Yes it is.  I absolutely love Bad Habits, and the video is so freaking hot.  I also love Stop the World, and Help Somebody.  I think this cd is difinitely worth purchasing, you will enjoy it.  However it is a little short on tracks.  Only 9 tracks to be exact. I wanted more of Maxie.  I just love this man.
B001AN2BMG|5.0|The only song I've heard is \\"Life is Beautiful\\"... I just downloaded it, and I'm gonna get the rest of the album next week. What an amazing song!!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore takes us around the World to see how wonderful National Health Care is in several different countries. A visit to a doctor in England who has a nice new car and large home with all the modern appliances who said he was very satisfied with Universal Medicine. The waiting period is no worse than here and every one is covered. The film is a MUST SEE NOW film. It was nominated for an Oscar.
0385342020|5.0|I love the Shopaholic series, and I've read all of her other novels.  Twenties Girl is definitely right up there for me as far as Sohie Kinsella goes.  It was fun, believable (if you believe :O)) and funny!  I enjoyed Lara and Sadie both, and genuinely felt the connection between the two as friends.     On a more serious note, I thought it was wonderful how Lara had never known this person, never bothered with her, then learned so much about her when she met her ghost.  It's sad because the older generation is out there, and they hold so much history, and they are so often forgotten about.       Searching for Sadie's necklace only brought her into Lara's life...everything else that came after is where the real story was.       Sophie Kinsella has never disappointed me and she is one of the few authors I will go out and buy as soon as her books are in stock.  I absolutely thought this was a fantastic story, and it very much had Sophie Kinsella's touch.  I highly recommend it.
0670020745|1.0|I was interested in the book because I have had a stroke. I had it on May 2007. My speech was the only thing affected. I lived in a quiet place. Raking and putting new grass in. I didn't know what hose was. Nor grass seed. I thought about words but couldn't find them. I asked my brother about the picture on the wall. Barn, house and clouds. He told me each day. I couldn't remember it. I finally decided to write them on paper. Wernicke's Aphasia. I went to a speech language pathologist. I got better at words each day. The more I get excited the more words get away. Then the stroke took over pain. I had epidurals, laminectomy and vertebroplasty. The pain was always there. Where from, to where I did not know. It was just there. Medications - opioids. The strongest. No help against the pain. Stay in a nursing home. Finally Lyrica. It was not enough help. Amitriptyline was the answer. Two made me better. I am living with almost no pain. Very few people knew what central pain was. They couldn't treat me. My only strength was God. I didn't have much for 2 years. I think that God lives in our brain. The author ignored God. God lives.

B002436WFI|4.0|I've long been a fan of Terry Pratchett novels, particularly the Disc World series. The man has such a remarkable facility with the English language that reading the books is actually a soothing experience. I was very pleased to find that the movie version of the Color of Magic was very faithful to the dialogue and pacing of the book. The only quibble I have is that I'm not sure that I would have cast Sean Astin as Twoflower. I love Sean as an actor, but he didn't quite convey the hopelessly naive and myopic character from the book. In short, I enjoyed the movie very much and would have no trouble recommending it to those who also enjoy whimsy.
0307269981|5.0|Loved the first book. Loved this book. Desperately anticipating the finale. The detail and depth in which Larsson wrote is genius. His books are mentally and emotionally stimulating. Never have I found myself so angry at the antagonists in a story. Larsson must have been a man who truly loved woman. Both books so far in this series expose the many different forms and depths the hatred of woman takes and the various levels in society where the prejudice is found. I am not a feminist but he's my hero!
B001FB55H6|5.0|It you are going to get Watchmen, get this version.  The main addition for me was Hollis's death.  When I saw it in theaters I was dissapointed it wasn't in the story.      Other than that everything else added made the movie more complete.  The Watchmen World is so fascinating and the movie is done so well I didn't even notice the movie was over 3 hours with this cut and I still wanted more.
B000W4KT64|5.0|This DVD of Hairspray was excellent. The sound quality was good and very enjoyable. Wonderful to watch.
B000LT2IHI|3.0|This is a cute little toy and my daughter likes to play with it, but not for too long.  She like to press the button to make the music so she can dance to it.  The only complaint I have and what caused me to rate it 3 stars is the balls get stuck in the mouth.  If you don't set the ball in the mouth just right you have to press very hard to get the ball to go down.  Little babies (my 15 month old) have problems getting the ball in the mouth correctly for it to go down.  I even have to give it a good push for it to go down.  My daughter doesn't even try to put it in the month and just drops the ball on the spiral itself.
0385512104|4.0|This story is cleverly written in the first-person perspective of Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy.  Throughout the story, Christopher is investigating the mystery of who killed his neighbor's dog, Wellington. To aid in his investigation, Christopher documents his findings in a book, which he entitles, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.  Over-time, and in a round-about-way, his investigations reveal many things about himself, his neighbors, and his family, and eventually un-covers the answer to: Who killed Wellington.<br /><br />Although I wasn't quite as impressed with this novel as many other people were that I know, I did enjoy it and thought the author was creative in its execution. However, I also thought that same creativity was a bit pretentious, (this author implied that he knew with great certainty how to speak as an autistic citizen.) I'm not sure why this bothered me (not offended, just bothered), isn't that what authors of fiction do?  I'm curious about how I would feel about this book if I were autistic, or had an autistic child.
B001S33D1G|4.0|I am very surprised that there is only one review on this book, and even more shocked that the review itself is a critical one. Yes, there is a bit of horror in Coraline, but to me this made it deliciously creepy. And it is not your typical \\"dark and stormy night\\" creepiness either. Coraline is very unique, a sort of mixture of science fiction and mystery that blends together perfectly to create a great story, the perfect book for nighttime reading.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The first Alan Parsons record I ever heard. The one that got me hooked on him. Perhaps the best of his work, when he and Woolfson were hot. Deep. Good vibes.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|this book was such a lovely book. I loved it so much I got it on my kindle.
B000IOM1Y6|5.0|In my humble opinion, the finest Parsons album created. Woolfson's voice/lyrics and his arrangements make an unbeatable combination. If you like Alan Parsons even a little, this is a must.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|Wow, Season 2 is even better than the first...viewers will not be disappointed.
0307266303|5.0|If you'd asked me for a review halfway through this book, I would have said that it was pretty good, but it was also annoying.  I enjoyed the travel adventure aspect and the and sociology study of the Tarahumara people of Mexico, but I was annoyed by the author's hipster language and gung-ho, X-games style.  (I find that type of writing to be designed to make you feel guilty that you're not as cool or fearless; but I always think, well, how does this guy's wife and two kids feel when he leaves for 5 weeks to go on an adventure for an article?)    But at some point, the author found his stride (or perhaps I found a way to match his stride), and I was hooked.  McDougall has a fantastic finishing kick, in the sense of tieing things together.  He wraps up disparate ideas from sociology, history, biology, modern athletic competition, nutrition, and X-games type partying into one satisfying whole. And, contrary to making me jealous, the book potentially will change my life.  I'm starting to work on the running style that he advocates, and I hope that it will reduce or eliminate the persistent heel pain I've had for more than 5 years.    McDougall, is an established freelance writer who's not afraid of challenges (war reporting, X-games types of adventures, etc.).  He's not your average guy, despite his effort to portray himself as such.  But the one nagging thing for him is that he's been unable to become a decent distance runner despite years of effort, expensive equipment, and the help of a multitude of doctors, massagers, and physical therapists. At the point of his worst failure, he decides to find out if a radically different type of running style will give him the breakthrough that he is seeking.    And thus, McDougall goes in search of the Tarahumara, \\"tribes\\" of natives who live in the Copper Canyon region of Mexico. Living in an extremely harsh environment and desperate to hide from centuries of human predators (conquistadores, Mexican government, drug smugglers), the Tarahumara have developed super-human abilities to run long distances in the heat and without much water or food.  Are they just rumor, in the same way as the legendary running monks and other endurance specialists?  McDougall sets out to find out if they exist, and then if they have learned techniques that can be translated to the lifestyles of the rest of us.    The descriptions of wandering around Tarahumara territory are fascinating. The land is a bunch of dirt trails and shantytowns of 5-20 buildings, set impossibly deeply in canyons and almost invisible from 50 yards away. But with the help of an American, Micah True, who's refashioned himself as Caballo Blanco and become a part of the Tarahumara community, McDougall gets to meet some runners and see them in action. He's convinced that they are doing things differently, and he agrees to help Caballo Blanco by publicizing Caballo's dream of a race between the Tarahumura and the world's best distance runners.  Actually, the Tarahmuara have raced -- and won -- ultramarathons throughout the US West; but Caballo's idea is to bring the modern world's runners down to Tarahumara territory instead.    As we build towards the race, McDougall explains how the Tarahumara run: literally. The Tarahumara run in homemade sandals from discarded tires, and they can go 50, 60, 100 miles a day over unforgiving terrain. The different is that they move differently than those of us who use highly padded running shoes. They use their whole feet and their legs to absorb impact, rather than landing on their heels. Apparently, our high-tech shoes have made our arches soft, which has then pressured our Achilles, calves, ankles, etc., and that's why so many of us distance runners have chronic injuries.     In exploring this difference, McDougall gives us quick history and biology lessons, covering evolution, the Olympics, and utra-distance running.  It's great stuff.  And he introduces us to Scott Jurek, perhaps the world's most accomplished ultra runner, and a never-quit guy; up-and-comers Jenn Shelton and Billy Barnett, two surfer-hipsters who eschewed proper food and normal training; Dr. Joe Vigil, an elite running coach who also believed in the innovations of the Tarahumara; and Rick Fischer, a runner and entrepreneur who first brought the Tarahumara out of the Canyon.  Other characters abound, too.     It all comes together unforgettably on the road trip down the Canyon, complete with near-death experiences, warm cultural exchanges, and the ultimate respect that world-class athletes have for each other.      And if this book has exposed me to a running style that will reduce my pain, then it will literally change my life. How often can you say that about a book?
B0013FSL0C|5.0|We LOVE \\"In Treatment\\" and appreciate the way it depicts real life. The characters have intriguing stories, and the psychologist even has a therapist. This show is highly recommended for those interested in this topic.    For a comedic view on treatment or therapy, we absolutely LOVE [[ASIN:B001NY6YQG Head Case: Season 1]].
B001W63DY6|5.0|I love Barbra since I was 16 (46 now), she is one of the best singer of the world. This show is something that you must have. Love you Barbra.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|Same issue I've seen reported in other comments.  Disc one is actually disc two.  Notified seller and received another copy labeled disc one that is also actually disc two.  SO I now have four copies of the second disc, two of which are labeled disc one.  Now THAT's frustrating.....
B0019LY5I2|3.0|Many men my age grew up playing with GI Joe army men (note to women: DO NOT CALL THEM DOLLS!) I even had the one with the Kung Fu Grip. And I had his army jeep, and his shoulder-mounted bazooka and other weaponry. So I was pretty keen to see what Hollywood might do with my beloved GI Guy.<br /><br />Well ...it was entertaining. It's a summer popcorn flick, for sure. And its got some nice CGI. But little else beyond that. The story is fairly lame and ultimately predictable. Channing Tatum as the new Joe recruit named Duke is okay, but nothing to write home about (note to Mr. Tatum: I'm aware that you're a true Kung Fu expert, so please don't take this personally). I don't particularly blame Channing Tatum for this, as the script was lacking more than anything he did or didn't do. Some of the lines were so obnoxiously bad that I literally cringed (ex. \\"That's my girl.\\" Ouch). And although Sienna Miller ([[ASIN:B000EDWKXI Casanova]]) pulled in a pretty good performance as a kick-ass femme fatale, she was overshadowed by the testosterone-filled guys who ultimately end up helping fight off the evils in and around her. Dennis Quaid ([[ASIN:B0018CWW3C Vantage Point]]) continues to be cast-type in mediocre films when I know he can do better since he was in one of my favorite science fiction films, [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]].<br /><br />Director Stephen Sommers is best known for his comedic action films ...such as [[ASIN:B001HQZJPM The Mummy Trilogy]], and here he tries valiantly to keep that funny streak going. Although there were some funny moments thanks to Marlan Wayans (Yes, he's one of the Wayans' brothers), the relatively nonstop action quickly negated it.<br /><br />So after ripping it apart, one might expect a pretty bad rating from me. But it was a fun diversion for a lazy summer day. It works on only one level: mindless action entertainment. So if you're in the mood for such a thing, it might suffice. If not, go check out something more cerebral like [[ASIN:B0021L8US0 District 9]].
B001RTP3Z0|3.0|Leonard Cohen's modesty and sincerety and the poetry and music make this worth while.  The quality of the video and the lighting is generally poor and does not do justice to the quality of the performer. I would recommend that a new video be filmed at one of his shows but with the right sound, lighting and camera work for a first class DVD.
1573300403|5.0|I really really really love this dvd. It's a collection of Michael Jackson's greatest videos. I really love the version of Smooth Criminal that is on this dvd. The video for Sream is a must have! Him and Janet outdid themselves with this. I also love the perfromance from the 1995 MTV Video Music Awards. This is a must-have for all Michael Jackson fans.    R.I.P. Michael Jackson we miss you and we love you!
0393061310|5.0|When Guns, Germs and Steel was released several years ago I dismissed it as a pop history book.  But, recently a friend described the book to me and I was intrigued.      In the 1970's Jarred Diamond was walking along a beach in Papua New Guinea when he met and talked with a local tribal politician called Yali.  In their conversation, Yali asked Diamond why it was that Europeans had become so developed, when his people had not. This book is a very thorough answer to that question; describing how tribes and bands of hunter gatherers became farmers who formed complex societies; and why Europe won.    I just wish I had read this book when it came out.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Unfortunately this blu-ray is way under par.  They have used an old master, which they have DNR:d (filtered) and then tried to sharpen artificially.  The result is astonishingly bad.    No resemblance to the blu-ray of Braveheart, which looks extremely good!!    Unfortunately so, since this is one of my favorite films.  Even if its' hard to resist - don't buy it. You'll thank me later.    Sapphire series - what a joke!
B00192IV0O|3.0|Just a short review....    I'm a huge BEP fan, absolutely LOVE Fergie.  But I was a bit disappointed with this cd.  To me it sounds like they just threw it together really fast, just to put something out there to make some cash.  On the Target Special Edition they just redid some of their other songs from their older cds.  It's not a horrible cd, but just not their best...
B0000640VN|3.0|In a place everything is possible New York City is, a higher-caste engineer from the past found himself in modern NY thanks to technical endeavours of his future descendant, an ex-boyfriend and neighbour of a modern Manhattan advertising chief-executive.<br /><br />Sexy funny sci-fi film is rather of what modern males lost upon the time than of what modern females suppose parting with.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|I love her style and fashion of Jennifer. She is a outstanding singer, and actress.
B002CAWNEM|3.0|Though there is absolutely no character development whatsoever, I was still entertained.  Ali Larter had crazy down pat there was just no rhyme or reason to what was going on.  I still dont know what happened in that hotel room.  Whether he slept with her or not.  Why she didn't contact him while he spent 3 months out of the house--or at least attempt to get rid of the wife doing that time.  There seem to be a lot of TV actors doing this TV director a favor for his first motion picture.  Heck, we all have to start somewhere.  I didn't think Beyonce was horrible, but she wasn't great either.  But hey we live in a world where Madonna has a Golden Globe--so anything is possible for her acting career.  Especially since she goes out of her way to perform at every Oscar show now.  But back to this movie.  Overall I found it entertaining for a knock off of every revenge of the crazy flick that had come before it.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|I will question why the extended scenes were edited though. I think the extra disc is worth the purchase just for them alone esp. the scene where Lazarus comes across the incarcerated Tugman. Definitly a spoof of the Marlon Brando/Martin Sheen scene from Apocalypse Now. I picked this up for 7.99 making the choice for me a no brainer.  The alternate ending though was not to my liking.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|First of all, this is a fabulous album. Great sound, nice running order.Many others have commemted on the highs and lows: to me, this is how the lp should have been put out.A little more interest by the band, and with George Martin producing, we could have had this instead of Spector's Folly.    That said, I find a few things lacking. The absolutly hideous title and artwork,for starters.The title conjures up visions of Yoko Ono and... well let's not go there. Why not use the original title ( Get Back) and artwork that was done.Much more interesting and pertinent to the release.It also would have been nice to have George\\"s complete Beatle's version of \\"All Things Must Pass\\" on the album, which would have enhanced it greatly. One last complaint would be, instead of the usless 2nd disc, why not put  a 2nd disc of the original Gyn John's version of the lp? It would have made for a nice comparison for those who don't own the bootleg versions.     That having been said, throw away your copy of Let it Be, and buy this: you won't be dissapointed.
B0024F08RO|4.0|Excellent servcice. Item came in superior quality and fast service. Would definately purchase products from them again.
B0013A24XC|4.0|The Mars Volta is one of the most unique bands out today. \\"The Bedlam and Goliath,\\" is one of their better albums in my opinion and is a good introduction to the group. The only downfall to me is the disappointment I felt when I realized this band is better experienced live. Their songs are usually long and sometimes too long, hence the necessity to see them live. However, each song is loaded with pure talent and worth the listen to any true music lover. I recommend purchasing this album at least for the artistic experience.     P.S.       The backstory to the album needs to be read first before listening to the songs. Creepy!
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is my absolute FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  I buy copies and give it to friends.  If you can get rid of the background noise in your life and sit back in quiet for an hour and watch this you will love it too.  I was not a big history lover and for me this was also bringing the war to life.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I was hesitant about watching this movie because of the bad reviews. I am so glad I watched this movie anyway. What a touching funny movie. I adore \\"Momma Mia.\\"<br />Meryl Streep was a goddess. All the actors and actresses were right on. My aunt and I are still singing some of the songs from the movie. You have to watch this movie at least 3 times to get the full affect. The scenery was to die for.<br />Pierce Brosnan was gorgeous. Some of my favorite parts were when when Donna was painting her daughter's toes before the wedding.Plus, the song \\"When all is said and Done\\" was purely for the teary eyed person to relish.This was a funny, sweet, tear jerker movie.<br /> A must see for anyone loving movies with heart.<br />I know I will be watching it again and again.<br />Now, if I could sing these songs without breaking the windows....<br /> we would really be talking!!<br />Plus, the ending where they wore those gaudy costumes ,was hysterical!<br />It looked like everyone in the movie was enjoying themselves. They looked so happy and carefree. That's a good kind of movie to be in. A movie where everyone looked so happy just to be there. It showed in their faces and their performances.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Everyone knows the superb quality of the episodes from TOS Season One, and with this Blu-Ray set you can watch either the remastered or original FX. The episodes do appear with black bars on the top, bottom, and both sides on 4:3 televisions. Picture and sound quality are excellent, as is to be expected with Blu-Ray.
0743289692|5.0|This is a remarkable story and a remarkable woman. She and her siblings suffered genital mutilation at the hands of her grandmother at a young age and as a teen was she became a hard core head to toe covered Muslin in Nairobi, Kenya where they lived at the time. Blessed with the ability to read and speak English, she, a few of her friends and classmates devoured romance paperback novels, which for some reason were plentiful. These books depicted a life of freedom, romance and marrying for love. A life that none of them could even comprehend.<br /><br />Little by little she began to wonder about the crazy life she was living, and if the life depicted in the books was typical of everywhere outside the Muslim world. When she reached the age of majority her often absentee father (they didn't know it but he had another family) arranged a marriage to a Canadian Muslim.<br /><br />She was against any arranged marriage, but her father wouldn't relent. On the flight to Canada, there was a stopover in Germany and knowing a family there she sought refuge. While waiting for the government to make a decision about her staus she snuck over the border into Holland, where she bloomed as a woman's right activist. Even becoming a Dutch legislator. Eventually, she outraged Muslim men. Her life was threatened and she now lives in hiding.<br /><br />I doubt if Ayaan herself was the actual writer of the book, but whoever wrote it, did a commendable job. The story, was clear, flowed well and was laid out in perfect order. The writing itself flowed well and was easily understandable.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Ayaan Hirsi Ali is a true role model for the many beaten down women of Islam. When other Muslim women take similar paths, despite what the Muslim men want, life for Muslim women in general will gradually change for the better.
B0011ZNAIC|1.0|I wouldn't know if this is a good movie or not because I tried 3 different DVD's and none worked. I checked other slots on the DVD player, checked for dirt, damage, made sure other DVD's worked - nothing solved the problem. I eventually just asked for a refund.    I don't know what the technology is for this DVD but it doesn't seem to work.
B001VPJYZK|4.0|In my opinion, in its first four years on the air, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has had three out of four really good seasons. The first, third, and fourth seasons were excellent. Only the second season wasn't quite as good. So going into the fifth season of this hit show I wondered if it was going to match the greatness of its best years. Sad to say it didn't. The fifth season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" was its weakest season yet. I still liked the fifth season of the show, and I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 (it falls more under 3 1/2 stars than 4). But I've got a feeling that it might be running out of gas down the road in its later years to come.     For the most part, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" season five is still pretty good. There are plenty of moments that are funny, sexy, and suspenseful. There was nothing wrong with the acting. The regular cast is back and the acting is fine as usual. There was nothing wrong with the presence of Teri Hatcher (Susan), Marcia Cross (Bree), Felicity Huffman (Lynette), Eva Longoria Parker (Gabrielle), Nicolette Sheridan (Edie), and season four newcomer Dana Delany (Katherine) on the screen. Same goes for the other cast members as well. Along the way in season five there were some newcomers. The most notable newcomer to season five was Neal McDonough, who plays Edie's new husband Dave. This character provides most of the story arc to season five which means that this character has a deep dark secret that plays out during the season (quite similar to Dana Delany's character in season four). McDonough is very good here and there's no fault in his character's storyline.     There were other newcomers to season five, and many of the new faces were provided thanks to the five year jump that this show took at the end of season four. There are now older actors who are playing the Scavo kids (Lynette's three sons and one daughter). Susan and Mike's son, born at the end of season four, is now five. And Gaby and Carlos have two daughters (also shown at the end of season four). The storyline with the five year jump into the future I think might have hurt the show a little. I think I liked it better with the way it was. It's obvious that \\"Desperate Housewives\\" creator Marc Cherry wanted to make some changes so that way the show can stay fresh. Not a bad idea, but for me changes don't always cut it.    As for which episodes were the best, I'd have to say the very best episode of season five was the show's 100th episode, titled \\"The Best Thing That Could Have Ever Happened\\" (in the show's fifth season, it's episode #13). Here's an episode that takes a total departure from its regular storyline to focus on Wisteria Lane's local handyman, wonderfully played by Beau Bridges. The handyman dies of a heart attack at the beginning of the episode, and the ladies flashback on how this man affected their lives over the years. Bridges' guest appearence provided \\"Desperate Housewives\\" with one of its only two Emmy nominations that it received this year. Another good episode was #8: \\"City on Fire\\". This was supposed to be the big episode of the season, following on the heals of the tornado episode from season four and the supermarket hostage crisis episode from season three, which rank as the two best episodes of the show so far. In this episode, a nightclub fire puts the housewives and their husbands in danger. However this episode (even though its a good one) isn't quite up to the tornado and hostage crisis episodes from the previous seasons.    Besides Bridges, other familiar guest stars from season five include: Gale Harold (\\"Queer as Folk\\") as Susan's new boyfriend Jackson (the mystery man Susan was kissing just as season four ended); Lily Tomlin as Mrs. McCluskey's sister Roberta; Gail O'Grady (\\"NYPD Blue\\") as a promoter who Lynette thinks her husband Tom is having an affair with, but it turns out she's having the affair with one of the Scavo twins; Frances Conroy (\\"Six Feet Under\\") as one of Carlos' massage clients whointegrates herself into the lives of the Solis family which in the process upsets Gaby; Steven Weber (\\"Wings\\") as Julie Mayer's much older new beau (Andrea Bowen, who played Julie in the first four seasons but is not a regular in season five reprised her role for this one episode); and Swoosie Kurtz (\\"Sisters\\") as a worker at a school that Susan goes to work at who turns out to be a closeted lesbian. Besides Bowen, other regular \\"Desperate Housewives\\" actors from the past turn up, including Richard Burgi as Susan's ex-husband Karl; Steven Culp in a flashback scene as Bree's late husband Rex; and Christine Estabrook (also in a flashback) as season one neighbor Mrs. Huber.    Season five of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has some problems. First of all the storyline, even though it's good, isn't as good as past storylines. This lead to a couple of episodes that were just downright dull. Plus a couple of minor storylines were kind of ridiculous. The most absurd was Bree's current husband Orson becoming a kleptomaniac, where he was breaking into houses on Wisteria Lane and stealing items from each house. Another problem was Gaby's selfish behavior, which was funny in earlier seasons but in season five was starting to get tiresome. One of the dumbest scenes of all time on this show comes in season five's first episode, where Gaby plays a game with one of her chubby daughters. It's where Gaby wants her daughter to lose weight by having her chase Gaby's car while Gaby drives a little bit away just as her daughter reaches up to the car. Then the daughter, very tired from all the chasing that her mom is making her do, gets on a bus and takes the bus home much to the chargin of Gaby. This is not \\"Desperate Housewives\\" at its best. Plus, Lily Tomlin isn't hardly given anything to do as Mrs. McCluskey's sister Roberta. Tomlin is one of our finest comediennes. Couldn't the writers given her something more to do?    Let's hope that season six of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" will be an improvement, but I'm not all that enthusiastic. Nicolette Sheridan is now gone, thanks to her late season departure. That's a shame because Edie was one of the very best characters on the show. But at least a familiar face has joined the cast for season six: Drea de Matteo, best known for her brilliant Emmy winning role as Adriana on the superb HBO series \\"The Sopranos\\", will be coming to Wisteria Lane. I'm looking forward to seeing if she can give this once great show a much needed boost.
B001BJ6918|5.0|A top notch movie worth watching over and over again just to find hidden things the director put in either as tribute or simply to make the film feel complete in his mind. The story is incredible, the filming is excellent as is the acting, and it remains one of my favorite movies to this day.
1577314808|1.0|Seems like Eckhart Tolle took Zen Buddist concepts, added a dash of Christianity, and wrote a book.  The basic concept is to find a way to quiet your mind and live in the Now.  Great ideas.      However, the book is not helpful.  When the author tries talk about adopting his concepts to the everyday world, reality gets in the way.  For example, he recommends that we let go of the concept of \\"time.\\"  Later, when addressing this cosmic concept, he retreats to a more practical approach - we're to let go of \\"psychological time\\" but keep \\"clock time.\\"     And, suggesting that we let go of our ego just seemed plain ironic in light of the author's apparent self regard.      I was so frustrated, I quit the audio tape half way through.

0393096688|5.0|I bought this a long time ago and have used it over and over again. The text is set out well, and the essays, from Jane Austen's time to a little while ago, provide invaluable insight both into Jane Austen and the times of the writers. They are truncated to fit more of them in: I went to find the original essay of Bradley's on Austen and found a lot more there. The essays do not try to befuddle you with jargon and literary theory; they shed light rather than obfuscating. Spend a little extra and get a lot more.

That's not easy to find in children's books. With only about one sentence per page, it moves quickly, the children feel they are reading and not bogged down on one page.<br /><br />The story about a mouse that wanted a cookie and then all the things that go with it really captivates the young audience. My children, age 4 and 7, both enjoy reading it or having it read to them over and over -- and I don't mind!
B000001EXR|4.0|This album was shrouded in one of those never meant to be albums. Supposedly it was to be released in 1994 to coincide with the release of \\"Kiss My A**\\", but somehow someone offered them alot of money to regroup, and put on the make-up, and do a reunion tour. While \\"Revenge\\" was a good album let's face it the big hair metal bands were becoming a thing of the past. Warrant was trying to do thrash metal, Ratt broke up, Motley Crue's 1994 release was less glam, and more hard rock from the 70's. Kiss saw the writing on the wall, and wanted to try their hand at the latest craze which was grunge. They apparently did their homework as it comes close to sounding like Seattle, but still comes off sounding like NYC. Some of the highlights are: \\"Hate\\", \\"Jungle\\", \\"Seduction Of The Innocent\\", and \\"I Walk Alone\\". Mind you Kiss may have waited too long to go grunge as grunge by April 8, 1994 was starting to die off after Kurt Cobain's death. However, all is not lost here, in fact it sounds like what \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" should've sounded like in 1976. Now we'll never know what Kiss was capable of doing with grunge let along alternative music in general. Once the reunion tour was off and running they never looked back. I will have to play \\"Psycho Circus\\" to see if they went alternative, or no. Otherwise this is what could've been the \\"NEW\\" Kiss. I have no idea what Eric Singer is up to these days, but I know Bruce Kulick went on to play with Grand Funk Railroad. I haven't decided yet if I will buy this, or not. It does sound appealling.
B000066NW0|5.0|I love all kinds of music but generally gravitate towards hard rock, and have been a fan of Metallica since I was fourteen, so if someone would have told me I'd be rating an Avril Lavigne CD with 5 exhuberant stars I might have laughed.  As a matter of fact, when it was first released (since I don't listen to the radio) I had no interest in buying it.  One day I happened to hear \\"Complicated\\" at a friends and was surprised when they told me who it was.  I bought this CD and I can tell you, I've owned it now for a few years and still feel this is a very strong work.  I would say this is as poignant and mature as Jagged Little Pill.  If anything what Jagged Little Pill meant for us twenty-somethings, Let Go is just as incredibly raw and real for those in their late teens.  The songs are structured well, I don't think they are trite at all and the lyrics are heart-felt and meaningful.  I suppose her success at such a young age has caused some animosity, some \\"haters\\", but I don't think that Avril is meant to be hard core punk.  If you are a punk purist than why are you even buying this album??  I don't think it's fair to throw mean comments at the artist because at some point, some magazine referred to her as \\"punk\\".<br /><br />If you like commercial rock/pop with great lyrics give it a try, don't be afraid!  Haha, I wasn't and I'm not afraid to tell my old Metallica-purist friends that I dig her music, most of them do too! (Even the ones who wouldn't admit it)
B0002BO05S|2.0|No wonder this movie was a flop when it was released.  It is pretentious and makes up its own story line instead of following any of the Gospel stories.  It has events all out of sequence or distorted.  Lots of shots of Arizona hills and gullies - pretty boring before long.  Of all the modern movies about Jesus, this is definitely the worst.

1416562605|4.0|Young Balram Halwai, describing himself as \\"The White Tiger, A Thinking Man, And an Entrepreneur\\" in Bangalore, has decided to tell the story of his short life to Premier Wen Jiabao of China, who is about to visit the city.  In a long letter to Jiabao, written over the course of a week, Balram describes his childhood, his escape from rural Darkness to the city, his slow journey from poverty into a servitude which pays him enough to survive, and ultimately his successful entrepreneurship in Bangalore.  He is also a wanted man, with his face on posters.<br /><br />A black-humored study of India from the point of view of an undereducated boy who yearns to be free, Balram's narrative explores the class divides:  \\"These days, there are just two castes:  Men with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies.\\"  The Big-Belly class includes all public officials, large business owners, and judges, all of whom (in this novel) enhance their salaries by extortion, the private sale of public property, and/or the acceptance of bribes.  Dealing harsh and sometimes fatal penalties to the Small-Bellies who cross them, these criminals are among the most successful \\"entrepreneurs\\" in the country.<br /><br />Though a promising student, Balram must give up a scholarship and drop out of school to work, breaking coals at a tea shop to help pay a money-lender for his sister's wedding.  When he eventually hears that taxi drivers can earn a good living in the city, he persuades his grandmother to help finance a driving course and moves to the city, where he works for Mr. Ashok and his wife Pinky Madam, as the second driver and servant.  He receives a salary, his meals, and a place to live in exchange.  He has few complaints about his treatment.  His crime against Mr. Ashok, his employer, which we learn in the first few pages of the novel, seems inexplicable, at first, but Adiga has cleverly organized the novel to parallel Balram's increasing awareness of how he is being used, along with his growing understanding of what he needs to do to become a Big-Belly.  Working for Mr. Ashok, Balram keeps his eyes and ears open, does what he is told, and looks for a way to escape his servitude.<br /><br />Adiga creates a unique look at Indian society, one in which the poor Balram, is suddenly exposed to the world of the wealthy, having virtually no contact with the middle-class now burgeoning in India.  This creates dramatic contrasts in description and characterization, which the author emphasizes through his dark humor, and as suspense builds throughout the novel about how and why Balram commits his crime, the reader sees that Balram recognizes that such a crime offers him his only chance at freedom.  Though Balram has been a lovable rogue for much of the book, no one will empathize with him as he commits his crime.  And therein lies the greatest strength of the book.  Because Balram has elicited our sympathy for most of the book, our shock is increased by his actions, and that, in turn, re-emphasizes the hopelessness of the poor in the face of widespread corruption by the Big Bellies in control. n  Mary Whippleing of what he needs to do to become a Big-Belly.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Quentin Tarantino can do a lot of things wrong- he has occasional pacing problems and sometimes becomes too enamored of his own dialogue to keep the story flowing.  But when he gets it right- oh boy, when he gets it right!  And with Inglourous Basterds- QT does everything right from the opening frame to the closing.    This war movie is unlike any war movie.  This Tarantino movie is unlike any Tarantino movie.  For those looking for Kill Bill-level bloodbaths, be warned- the violence in Basterds is as deliberate and restrained as a swastika carved into skin.  Additionally,a generous portion of the movie is in subtitled French or German.      Basterds introduces some of Tarantino's most.... delightful characters (that seems such an inappropriate word, but see the movie and try to come up with a better one).  Brad Pitt delivers an uproarious turn as Lt. Aldo Raine, the guerilla leader who's having a grand old time.  But the real standouts are Nazi Col. Landa (the Jewhunter) who's simultaneously ridiculous and terrifying and Shosanna Dreyfus the capable, understated but divinely ruthless fugitive heroine.  And the supporting characters are all sharp, snappy, real- the perfect balance between believably human and interesting charicatures.    Tarantino's movies can suffer from editing problems- but Basterds is not one of them.  The scenes are varied between taut suspense and black humor worthy of Alfred Hitchock.  The signature violence stands out in the few memorable incidents without being lost in a sea of artery-slicing.  And the plot is supremely, childishly satisfying.  Inglourious Basterds is the perfect paradox- a Tarantino movie with restraint.  The revisionist history-cum-revenge-fantasy is wild enough to stand without wall-to-wall gore, in fact gratuitous violence would make it almost too outlandish.  But with Basterds, Tarantino walks the line and proves himself once again, that elusive breed of bastard- a director who can surprise.
0307389839|4.0|Thank God for airport book stores.  I've never been one to pick up exhausting tomes while traveling--too much to read too much to carry--therefore when Haruki Murakami's new memoir, \\"What I Talk About When I Talk About Running\\" caught my eye at Atlanta's Hartsfield, it looked just right. Short, light, with a little bit of F. Scott and a little bit of Zen philosophy tucked inside (He never mentions Zen directly but his lifestyle screams it).  As a runner who runs and doesn't believe in walking during a marathon Murakami captures this essential truth with quality and gives us his recipe for endurance.  Not just with running but with life in general.  His analogies to running and writing are simple yet powerful.  For fans of Murakami's work this book should provide some insight into his his daily life,  simple yet somehow powerful.  For those unfamiliar with his novels, such as myself, I was sufficiently intrigued by his prose to grab a copy of \\"Norwegian Wood\\", one of his acclaimed works, as my next read.  At 60 Murakami still intends to publish novels and run marathons, presumably without walking.  His recipe seems to work.

1587613379|5.0|Very well written and full of useful information for any relationship you may have with someone.  The authors are kind and humorous and the anecdotal stories illustrate their points well.  They stress the importance of taking care of yourself, communicating effectively and nurturing relationships with your friends, partners, lovers.  It was refreshing that they did not try to categorize the relationships between people since relationships are tricky, complicated amorphous things.  It's clear that both authors have a lot of experience with being ethical (and maybe sometimes not so ethical) sluts.  As someone who is starting to explore polyamory, the ideas in this book have been tremendously helpful - especially the parts about owning your feelings, communicating and the transitory nature of relationships.  They also include some helpful resources on how to get started, finding groups, breaking up, how to deal with children and how to be a single slut.  This book has been amazingly helpful, not just for lovers but for any relationship!

B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook is a fantastic movie about an old woman with Alzheimer's disease (Allie) and her struggle to buy a notebook. If she doesn't have a notebook in which to write a reminder to purchase a notebook, how can a notebook be purchased? The film is deeply philosophical in respect to this paradox of memory, though as we shall see, The Notebook can also be interpreted as a metaphor for an entrance to the heart.    To help along the way is \\"Duke\\": an equally old but more mentally capable resident of Allie's nursing home. He reads Allie excerpts of her favourite novel - \\"Cliched Love Story\\" by Allan Smithee - on a daily basis, in the hope of improving her mental faculties. Unfortunately he cannot simply write the much desired and equally unobtainable shopping list, as he suffers from chronic arthritis in his hands, obtained after shooting many hundreds of Nazis in WWII. He also suffers from war flashbacks, which are represented at an abstract level by major and unexplained shifts in time within the film. Director, Nick Cassavetes, had originally filled these spaces with stock footage of the war coupled with original and insightful commentary from historians and military officers, however he was unfairly forced to cut these scenes in order to satisfy the studio's demands for a PG rating.    The bulk of the film consists of depictions of the events from within Smithee's novel. These concern a couple of young lovers - Noah & Allie - and the long and rocky road they must travel in order to achieve their long awaited goal of copulation. Allie's parents - wealthy entrepreneurs with a primary focus on the brothel industry - are concerned by Noah's lack of money, and, from a business perspective, simply cannot see what he has to offer their daughter. In a particularly impassioned scene, Allie screams that his money or lack thereof doesn't matter, that they are in love, and that her mother understands nothing of love. This is a subtle and poignant social commentary on the wayin which capitalism can divorce us from our humanity.    Right when they are about to do the deed in a dusty old cottage, the police arrive and whisk Allie back to her parents who leave town with her the following day. Heartbroken, Noah writes Allie every day for a year. After he receives no response to the first hundred letters, he grows weary and simply sends her Hallmark cards, which eventually become unaffordable owing to the financial (and psychological) depression, and so he degenerates to just forwarding her his junk mail, circling items he feels she may enjoy. Contrasting the previous point, this is intended to illustrate how economy and emotionality are intertwined, and how economy seizes the opportunity to take over when emotion is weak.    None of his letters ever reach Allie as all 365 of them are collected and stored by her evil and manipulative mother. Allie never had a chance to see any of them owing to her deep and incurable fear of mail boxes, which requires a total dependence on others to engage with all aspects of the postal system on her behalf. Allie eventually meets some other guy whose name I don't remember and he is all like \\"Damn momma! You is hot!\\" and, charmed by his romanticism and exemplary command of the English language, she soon agrees to marry him. This man, played exceptionally by rapper \\"50 cent,\\" is much more agreeable to Allie's parents owing to his wealth, consistently represented by the oversized piece of money he keeps on a gold chain around his neck at all times.    Years pass and, by a turn of fate, Allie happens to see a newspaper article with a picture featuring Noah standing outside that same dusty old house, however it is no longer dusty - it has been restored into a picturesque dwelling as if from a fairytale. Allie goes to visit. They exchange words. And I will stop here as I don't want to give away the emotional, unexpected and literally inexpressible ending; not even Cassavetes felt he could do it justice and so thelast three minutes of the film simply consist of the video clip for Sinead O'Connor's cover of \\"Nothing Compares 2 U\\".    This is a fantastic film that connoisseurs of notebooks the world over will adore. 5/5

B002CAWNEM|3.0|In the 2009 film Obsessed, director Steve Shill attempts to recreate the \\"[[ASIN:B00003CXA0 Fatal Attraction (Special Collector's Edition)]]\\" thriller about a pretty blonde temp secretary Lisa (Ali Larter) who has attractive successful investment banker Derek (nicely portrayed with gravitas by the understated and suave Idis Elba) in her rather infatuated sights.  Oddly, even though Shill has plenty of chances to inject some intrigue into this fairly routine go-around of one woman's mind fantasy about moving in on a one-time bachelor now happy family man complete with the lovely Beyonce as wife Sharon, a too cute toddler, brand new upscale abode and requisite Mercedes Benz, he plays it straight, offering instead the usual tale of pursuit, rejection and violence.<br /><br />With Jerry O'Connell playing a smarmy office mate, Shill had a great opportunity to add a behind-the-scenes note of competition utilizing Lisa's obvious charms as bait to lure Derek into a semi-scandal that may lose him the firm's more prestigious clients.  Doesn't happen.  This is \\"Fatal Attraction\\" redux without the boiling rabbit . . .<br /><br />. . . and without the quiet albeit resigned hysteria of the Anne Archer-type wife.  Once Sharon gets wind of Lisa's intrusion within her dream Queendom, her nostrils flare with a heady sense of survival `hood-style and she prepares herself psychologically with some knowingly street-smart explicatives that suggest that once she gets involved blood will be spilt.  Other than exhibit ample displays of anger and jealousy, Beyonce Knowles does little else--her role in [[ASIN:B001P3SA94 Cadillac Records]] as Etta James showcased her beauty and vocal talents with more poignancy and depth.<br /><br />Bottom line: Director Shill should have added a corporate rivalry subplot to this \\"Fatal Attraction\\" clone that would have at least warranted some ingenious form of retribution rather than just two women duking it out for the attentions of a stud-ly investment banker.

B001C3KCSY|1.0|Wow!!!! I can't believe what I just listened to. I was expecting something that builds upon their first 3 albums. Instead, this band has sadly been forced to create a commercial record label album rather than a Kings of Leon cd. Gone are the quirky rhythms, the dynamics of the vocals and instruments. I hope this touch of commercial popularity doesn't spoil what I thought was one of the best bands in a very, very long time.  It's s shame, but fans of this band beware. It has nothing going for it.

They gave us growth in characters and dramatic stories and the always enjoyable easter eggs of DC characters to grace the small screen. The question you should be asking yourself while you decide, is whether or not this season is worth the buy as a BOX SET, as oppose buying singular episodes. Its the same specials as previous sets (few commentaries, deleted scenes), but nothing out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Should this season be among your Smallville collection? Is it worth remembering? In my opinion yes! The exploration of Jimmy Olsen's character was wonderful and dark and his turbulant relationship with Chloe was good departure from Lana/Clark on/off dibacle. Lois was actually utilized effectively to amazing results. Tess Mercer was an interesting villianess to say the least, and Doomsday was pulled off well in live action. Supergirl returned and left gracefully (however, I will miss this Girl of Steel). And the \\"Legionaries\\" and \\"Injustice League\\" episodes and Zatanna apperance were fun, campy, and further developed Clark as a character and Hero. There are many things that should drive you to get the Season as a whole. However, drawbacks include the lackluster Lana and Clark drama/arc...again and the sort of anticlimactic season finale (for me at least). All that we saw this season and we get a weak Justice League appearance/cameo, the endless reference to the red/blue blur, and the disappearance and death of staple Smallville characters. To die hard fans, Clark/Superman was supposed to die at the hands of Doomsday. Way to mess with comicbook lore, writers.<br /><br />These flaws however will not deter me from getting Season 8 and it shouldn't deter you. Hopefully as season 9 draws near, these flaws will be addressed and Superman will be unleashed. The least they can do is give Clark glasses...isn't it about time?on 8 and it shouldn't deter you. Hopefully as season 9 draws near, these flaws will be addressed and Superman will be unleashed. The least they can do is give Clark glasses...isn't it about time?
B001NERPHS|4.0|....of cheap (in my case, Argentinian) South American imports being sold as the advertised Sony Legacy product. When I got mine, I noticed that the Sony logo looked weird and that the double jewel case seemed kind of cheap. Upon further inspection, I noticed that the product info was in Spanish and that the country of origin was Argentina. Although I doubt that the sound was negatively affected and the info in the booklet was in English, I noticed today at Barnes and Noble that the official domestic release is a digipac, which made me wonder if my copy was missing anything (like new photos, liner notes, etc.) Some of you may not care, but all things considered, I'd rather have the domestic US release, especially since that's what I thought I was buying.     P.S. JUST TO CLARIFY: This only applies to Amazon marketplace items, not if you buy it from Amazon direct. You might want to buy from them in this case to make sure you get the legitimate release. I wish I had....and I would be wary of buying all of the latest Dylan remastered releases from Marketplace vendors, especially if they are really cheap in price. Sometimes cheapest isn't always best....
0307277453|5.0|Maybe I'm jumping the gun but Neil Shubin can be the next Carl Sagan.  He has that same engaging way of drawing you and turning the most complicated scientific  topics palatable, digestable and downright interesting.  He takes us on a journey of the human body and its origins as far back as the gooweey primodial seas but really concentrates on the transitional stages that the human body took from its simplier form to what it is now. Shubin eloquently demonstrates and sites all the research and scientific findings that supports our kinship to frogs, sharks and early land creatures.  In the background is his own search for a complete fossil of Tikaalik, the first hybrid creature that crawl out of the sea to became the first land walker, our distant ancestor. Whilst Donald Johanson and the Leaky's  sweated it out on the African desert, Shubin and his collegues suffured the cold artic weather looking for his creature, and yes he does find her. I hope when you're reading this book you can experience the same awe of the beauty and sheer marvelousness of the human body.  But it also has it's limitation because after all our bodies started modestly simple and thru evolution and modification it tries to better itself, to be better equip in dealing and living in a more demanding environment.  Then you can appreciate why we have hemmoroids( we weren't meant to sit in car for hour long commutes 5days a week) or why we have annoying hiccups (our inhiritance from our fish swimming days).  This is truly a valuable book in furthering your understanding on how we got here and why we are what we are.  This book can appeal to new readers to this genre or to Darwin fans who want to increase their understanding of evolution.  Highly recommended.

I am a Tim Burton fan anyways so I knew I would love this movie. Oh and they did great with making the movie 3D and even when its not actually in 3D, the graphics are so good it still looks like it is even when you don't have the glass. Everyone should watch this movie!

0330485377|5.0|I was given a copy of The Lovely Bones to take on a cross-country flight and ended up reading it straight through on the plane.  Not only is it beautifully written, but Sebold expertly captures and conveys the raw emotion of a family in post-tragedy turmoil.  Early in the story, the Salmon family is ripped apart by the murder of their daughter, Susie.  The Lovely Bones is told from Susie's point of view as she watches her loved ones (and her murderer) from Sebold's unique interpretation of heaven.  It is a heartrending story, as any about the rape and murder of a child would be, but it manages to end with a note of hopeful redemption.  After many difficult years, Susie's family is finally able to emerge from the depressive wake of her murder, and the entire Salmon family - Susie included - learns how to let go and move on.
B00004YA66|5.0|An interesting idea that blends family and crime drama with sci-fi elements to make a highly entertaining movie `Frequency' is one of the most entertaining films of its kind. Quaid and Caviezel hand in very good performances and make the unbelievable, well.... believable. Usually these types of films can be confusing and tedious, but because the center story about a boy losing his firefighter father at an early age is heartfelt, it makes up for any minor plot holes. Look fast for a young Michael Cera as John's son. The DVD has an excellent transfer and there are some interesting extras including commentary, deleted scenes and feature-ettes.
0375842209|4.0|I approached this book a bit skeptically since it is considered a young adult book, however, I found The Book Thief one of the most heart-rending books that I have ever read. If you are a Nazi Germany buff, you will find this book is very different from what you have read. The Book Thief is a view of Nazi Germany through the eyes of children.    When Liesel Meminger's brother unexpectedly dies, her mother sends her to live with a small family in the town of Molching. Her new father is a gentle and caring man who makes her transition as easy as possible, but her new mother, Rosa Hubermann, is a slightly rougher and colorful character. Rosa, however, loves Liesel in her own unique way.    Liesel soon makes friends with a neighborhood boy named Rudy Steiner. Rudy and Liesel get into all sorts of mischief together and share a very deep and sincere connection. Liesel also befriends a boy named Max Vandenburg. Max Vandenburg is a Jew that Hans and Rosa Hubermann secretly keep in their basement at a time when being Jewish or sympathizing with anyone who is Jewish is extremely dangerous.    The first half of the book is about developing the relationships with Liesel and her new family and friends.You should be warned that the author takes his time with this.  Some people thought the book read a bit slow, but the author, in fact, did an exceptional job of developing and describing the different relationships Liesel enages in after her arrival in Molching.     Nazi Germany is not exactly my favorite time period when reading novels, but The Book Thief took an unpleasant period in time and retold it through the eyes of three innocent children. I would recommend The Book Thief to anyone who appreciates an author who takes his time developing characters and relationships. This was a very emotional novel that everyone needs to read.
B0021L8US0|5.0|Were this movie directed and produced by Hollywood brand names, it would have failed on all accounts and would have burned a very big black hole in their pockets.  This movie has received more hype and critical acclaim than The Matrix and has proven that this is the little movie that could and has - come so far out of left field that it has knocked all and sundry for six.    Sharlto's portrayal of Wickus is spot on - it takes another South African to recognise the performance and the satirical nuances and cheeky slap at how a typical Afrikaner bureaucrat may act in reality. He is naive, unsophisticated and gormless like Mr Bean.  He is self serving to the end and his moral compass operates in a very large grey area but the fact that he remains true to character right to the end and does not transform into a Bill Pulmanesque (Independence Day)type freedom fighter feels real and the audience automatically buys into this. He has no hesitation in aborting an alien egg but refuses to test fire the alien weapon against the helpless 'prawn'.    Johannesburg is as cosmopolitan as New York and London on the one hand and as riddled by squalor and shanty towns as any other 3rd World country on the other.  The Nigerian factor in the movie also rings true, despite several critics who questioned their significance in the movie.  Generally, South Africans across the racial spectrum have a very dim and suspicious opinion of Nigerians.  Nigerians have been in the news for all the wrong reasons - cheque fraud scams, drug and prostitution rackets and being, justly or unjustly, involved at all levels of crime in South Africa.  That they operate a cat food scheme in District 9 among the aliens is also a testament to the corruption and maladministration in the security (MNU in this case) forces that patrol the camp.  This is an accurate parallel to the South African Police Service that is riddled by corruption and incompetance and is wholly understaffed.

0374139563|4.0|It's ironic it took a Black African Woman to challenge, the sometimes well meaning financial aid, to this third world continent.  Today, aid has been the mantra of our Hollywood stars, world rock musicians, and even our national politicians.  The book looks at not only the negative effect of the staggering amount of money spent in Africa but how, and where, aid has worked in the world.  In addition it comes up with a prescription for getting Africa \\"off the drug\\" which has helped keep it in the state it is in.  Aid, with political strings attached, and dumping of goods produced elsewhere in the world, have only added to  Africa's future dependent status. It didn't take an African to explain this situation, but it did add to it's credibility.  This book should be read by people from all political views.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Quentin Tarantino, taking inspiration from the 1978 Italian film \\"Inglorious Bastards\\", \\"INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS\\" (now renamed \\"Basterds\\") is the latest installment from the acclaimed director. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" isn't just a war film, it is a war film with the Tarantino signature that features stupendous dialogue, incredibly opaque plotting, an anarchistic soundtrack (even worms in a David Bowie song from \\"Cat People\\"), accompanied by characters that are colorful that are almost mythic in nature. The film is not a history lesson in World War Two, but rather a fantasy war picture that bends the staples of cinema by having a plot executed with serenity, it is methodical and the results are quite excellent, having a feel of \\"Spaghetti Westerns\\" and the usual Tarantino sensibilities. One thing I like about Tarantino, h e doesn't adjust to his viewers, but his viewers just adjust to him, he never compromises his visionary ambitions---win, lose or draw.<br /><br />Once Upon a time in Nazi-occupied France (the film's first chapter opens as such), Lt. Aldo Raine (played by Brad Pitt) has assembled a small group of Jewish-Americans, their main objective; to kill as many Godless Nazis as they can. Called \\"The Basterds\\" they work in the country, often ambushing small groups of German soldiers, gather Intel and have made quite a feared reputation among the Nazi war machine. They must work with a British double agent named Bridget Von Haamersmark (Diane Kruger) who has intelligence on a Third Reich film feature that is to take place in the La Gamarr Theater located at a remote area in Paris. Fate deals an ironic hand as the theater is owned by Shoshanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent) a young Jewish girl who watched her family get massacred at the hands of Nazi Col. Landa (superbly acted by Christoph Waltz) who is better known as the \\"Jew Hunter\\". Now the movie premiere is set to be attended by top Nazi officials, including Adolf Hitler (Martin Wuttke), Raine and his company must do what they can to kill the Fuhrer himself...will they succeed?<br /><br />Tarantino have paid homage to Asian films in \\"Kill Bill\\", Blaxsploitation in \\"Jackie Brown\\", gangster movies in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\", grind house in \\"Death Proof\\"; \\"Inglourius Basterds\\" may well be his homage to foreign movies as he plays around with subtitles and cinematic set pieces, while giving the Nazis their due. \\"Basterds\\" is divided into 5 chapters that give it an episodic atmosphere with the usual fragmented style. Tarantino has a knack for cinematic brilliance, using the wartime palette; Tarantino utilizes certain restrained colors and frames his shots quite efficiently. Most of Tarantino's films are dialogue-rich and \\"Basterds\\" is no different. The conversations between the victims and the Nazis can get very edgy, while at the same time keeping a dark, predatory, sinister sense of humor on more than one occasion. Tarantino plays with accents and sharp-tongued dialogue to deliver the film's appeal with its language that delivers the dialogue in English, French and German.<br /><br />\\"Basterds\\" has a collection of flamboyant characters. Pitt as Aldo Raine nicknamed \\"Aldo the Apache\\" sports a moustache, has a raspy Tennessee drawl and a nasty scar on his throat shows him as someone who had experienced a harrowing past or perhaps a shady one. Aldo doesn't really get that much development, but the script works the way it is. It gives our \\"Basterds\\" a sense of mystery; all we know is the fact that these men are hell-bent on killing Nazis. They do so in the ala-\\"Apache\\" manner, scalping German soldiers to instill fear and intimidation. Aldo's pack is made up of other colorful characters, led by \\"Bear Jew\\" Donny Donnowitz (played by Eli Roth) who bashes Nazi skulls with a baseball bat and a man convicted of killing several Nazi officers called Sgt. Hugo Stieglitz (Til Schweiger) who seemed to be the \\"Shaft\\" guy of the Basterds\\".<br /><br />Surprisingly, the film isn't mainlyabout the Basterds at all; the screenplay is more about the victims of the holocaust and a cry for justice. The first chapter embodies the savagery of the Third Reich; the character of Shoshanna Dreyfus represents the horrors experienced by the Jews and I thought that her character gave the plot its heart and main spirit. Sure, it is easy to sympathize with her character but her relationship with a smitten Nazi private (played by Daniel Bruhl) is major catalyst for the film's last acts. Brad Pitt's \\"Aldo the Apache\\" is matched by a very edgy character in the form of \\"Jew Hunter\\" Col. Hans Landa. He matches Aldo's charisma with a sort of a predatory personality that lures his victims in with intimidating, long conversations into agreeing with him with a crude smile until such time as he can turn the tables on them. In this film, Landa embodies the evil, cruelty and savagery of Hitler's Reich, Landa is soulless, black heart of the third Reich. In many ways, I thought Christoph Waltz, a multi-lingual actor had stolen the show; the actor's presence onscreen exhibited an awesome presence with a bit of an unease about him. You just have to admire his cunning; Landa proves to be as sly as Aldo and may well be just as merciless. I may go as far as to say that \\"Basterds\\" is a huge success because of his character. There are also quick cameos by Mike Myers, a Samuel L. Jackson narration, and even a vocal surprise by Harvey Keitel.<br /><br />\\"Inglouroius Basterds\\" plays literary, depending on its characters that are all vying for personal satisfaction set in violent manner. Yes, the film may prove to be a bit of a dozy compared to \\"Kill Bill\\" but Tarantino does manage to inject some blood and gore into the mix. The pay off is very dark and enveloped in irony as Tarantino sends the Nazis into bloody murder in a propaganda with a gritty firefight. Tarantino seemed very much in love with tales of irony, messed up heroic goals and touches of poetic justice.<br /><br />There is nothing more fun in watching a film that gives Nazis their comeuppance. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" will not prove to be Tarantino's best film but it does make a perfect fit to Tarantino's line of `funky' genre-busting filmography. He makes a good case of amendment without giving controversy and avoids a disrespectful offense to the face of history. It is a fantastical piece of wish fulfillment--Tarantino remains as the man with cool `snappy`banter and bold ideas.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

0061245097|5.0|One Foot in the Grave by Jeaniene Frost is the second in the night huntress series. I don't often read one book after another in a series, but for this one, I made an exception. I hated the way the last one ended. So, I HAD to start this one to make up for it.<br /><br />This book starts 4 years later. Cat has made a new life for herself fighting vampires and leading a group of men she trained. They are very good at their job but something is missing in her life. After \\"serendipitously\\" meeting Bones's maker and letting him go, her life starts to change, but is it for the better? Bones also makes an appearance not long after she decides to date others. She meets him in all places at a friend's wedding. Things don't go smoothly, but yet their love finds a way and they plan together to keep everyone safe, especially Cat.<br /><br />So, with a \\"missing\\" father who still rules a part of her life and a very \\"interested\\" master vampire who Bones knows well wrecking havoc on their lives, they must find a way of mixing Cat's new life with their rekindled romance. The twists and turns keep for a fast and interesting read. Lots of action as well as the epiphanies within the mystery keep the book moving. This book is a must for those who love action with a smidgen of romance within. Great second book to this series. Of course, I recommend it.

0143038583|5.0|I wish I could give this book 10 stars. Everyone should read this book.    Do you ever wonder where your food comes from - I mean, before the grocery store or restaurant? No? You should. We all should. Our food dollars support agricultural practices that are largely invisible to us, and much of the industrial food machine is horrifying - morally, ecologically, and nutritionally.    This book is divided into three sections, one for each principle food chain:    1. Industrial (foods made largely from processed corn products)  2. Pastoral (foods that come from the energy of grass - organic)  3. Forest (foods hunted and gathered in the forest)    I got so upset reading about how beeves, pigs, chickens, and farmed salmon were treated in the standard Concentrated Animal Feeing Operation (CAFO) that I had to put down the book for a while. I also stopped eating animals that were tortured from birth to death, as most animals we eat in this country are.    Eventually my horror subsided enough that I was able to finish the book. There is so much good information: the downside of Big Organic, the beauty of a truly sustainable farm like Polyface (which I had the opportunity to visit last year), and Pollan's firsthand insights into the hunting and gathering experience.    This book is packed with fascinating facts and thought-provoking insights. That's enough reason to buy it. But it's also beautifully written - vivid, witty, and poetic. Pollan gained his knowledge by doing - working on farms, slaughtering chickens, learning to fire a gun and hunt. You laugh along with him as he describes his experiences (it's very funny in places), and his skill with language is such that you gain from his insights as if you were there.    This is an important book. Everybody should know where their food comes from.

B001FB4VZS|4.0|I've been a Smallville fan for a long time. I've seen every episode and watched it faithfully every thursday (soon to be friday) since I can remember. I thought Season 8 was good. I dont know why so many people said it wasnt very good. The only thing about Season 8 I would complain about would be the Clark/Lana aspect. It didnt seem necessary to bring her back in the first place but then to turn her into some superhuman in an alien suit was a little much for me. I liked how Lois had more screen time in this season since she plays the character really well. Overall I would say it was a good season, probably not the best, but certainly worth checking out.
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|The mark of a great film is the degree to which you continue to think about it after you exit the theater. And in the case of Quentin Tarantino's \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", I've been thinking about it almost non-stop since. On the surface, it may seem like a shallow, one dimensional film about a squad of Nazi-scalping Jews. If you take the story at face value, they are the \\"Basterds\\". And some have complained that the Basterds get too little screen time. However, after pondering the film for a while, you realize that almost every character in the film is an inglourious basterd in his/her own way: they take every opportunity to lie, cheat, pretend, betray and otherwise play dirty.<br /><br />Christop Waltz steals the show as Colonel Hans Landa, the charming, brilliant, and (above all) evil SS officer. As it turns out, Landa is by far the biggest basterd of them all. In almost every scene, you wonder what this guy is up to. And he surprises you--even when he shouldn't. Perhaps the finest scene is when Landa is interviewing Shoshanna (who is pretending to be Emmanuelle Mimieux) as a prelude to using her cinema for a big Nazi film premiere. You know he suspects that something is very wrong with her, but he mysteriously backs off at the last second. Though its unprovable, I got the sense that it is here that Landa begins to hatch his endgame plan. This is one of the many question marks that QT strategically inserted to keep the audience guessing. Like its characters, the film is not what it appears to be: it is a highly intellectual movie masquerading as an exploitive revenge fantasy.<br /><br />One of my main criticisms of the movie is QT's signature use of dialog. In his earlier works, like \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction\\", QT used dialog to humanize the characters. Even hit men make small talk about the same mundane stuff the rest of us do. In \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", however, this dialog becomes an implausible parody of itself. Even worse, it makes the movie drag when it shouldn't. So, to borrow a line from the movie, we end up waiting for the creame...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting. Perhaps the worst offender is the scene where the SS officer plays the card game with the Basterds in tavern. Perhaps the point was to show that SS officers may be annoying dolts, but also have a surprising familiarity with American films? In this regard, QT has to stop trying to be too clever when crafting his dialog--otherwise, he risks boring his fans to death.So, to borrow a line from the movie, we end up waiting for the creame...and waiting, and waiting, and waiting.

1400064287|5.0|This is an excellent book, in a similar vein to Robert Cialdini's ground-breaking book \\"Influence\\". Chip and Dan Heath turn their attention not to general principles of persuasion, as Cialdini does, but to the specific factors that make an idea stick in people's minds.    They share six principles that (admittedly in a cheesy way) almost spell \\"success\\": Simplicity, unexpectedness, concreteness, credibility, emotions and stories. They back up each of these principles by quoting research, case studies, examples and stories. It's an entertaining, as well as an educational, book.

B001PPLIEG|1.0|I would rate it as the worst Bond ever for at least two reasons.  The first one for me was the opening title theme which is suppose to set the tone for the rest of the film.  It was harsh, discordant, and unmelodic.  Most Bond themes I remember would either become hit songs in their own right, or at least warrant airplay time as stand-alone pieces of worthwhile music.  The theme for \\"Quantum of Solace\\" seems to be famous just for who performs it and not for any intrinsic value to the composition.  In other words, It Sucks.  The second reason is that the Bond humor is gone, and the plot is weak.  I had no feelings at all for the characters and no desire to spend one hour and a half with them, and especially no feeling of danger from the bad guy, he didn't seem threatening; just annoying, and what is that with the exploding hotel? I would guess that this film may be just a stepping stone in Bond's further development and that a really good third movie with Daniel Craig is coming.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|It's just odd to watch the spatter analyst/choosy serial killer Dexter Morgan do things like think about marriage and fatherhood in this season, which is not nearly as tense as the earlier seasons were.  You pretty much know who he's going to kill; it's just a matter of time.  His voiceovers are as entertaining as ever, Debra is still swearing up a storm, and Jimmy Smits does a good job as an attorney who wishes to partner with Dexter in getting rid of anyone deemed to be a bad guy.  There are also several close calls during which Dexter's activities are almost revealed.  Dexter also tries to separate somewhat from Harry and the Code, with mixed results.    I'd be curious to see what would happen if Debra, who is gaining power, ever gets too close to discovering the truth about her brother.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I can't believe I never heard the true story of Philippe P., who took his tightrope walking skills to extremes, culminating in a daring crossing--several times--between the late, great Twin Towers of the World Trade Center.  The film recreates some sequences but relies mostly on archival footage and on contemporary interviews with all the participants in regard to Philippe's escapade, which is also a work of art.  There is something very emotional about the whole issue as well, due to the inherent danger and the beauty of a man crossing a wire so high above the ground, with no safety net or harness to save him if he stumbles.    An interesting story that deserves attention.

It is a wonder how fine film making can still cause a skeptical viewer to suspend disbelief and catch a tangible emotional and physical sense of the unbearable tension and palm-sweating fear of being centerstage amid barely supressed hostility from a local population made up of the friendly, the indifferent and the murderous.  In short, she has created a chair-gripping intensity and her close-in camera work puts us right in the middle of the tension.    Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who imbedded with an actual Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit, waste no time getting us into the midst of the tension and action that is an everyday commonplace for these exceptional individuals.  Two surviving members of a team that has lost its leader get a hairy and wary introduction to the style and methods of their new team leader, Sgt. James (Jeremy Renner).  A gifted bomb disposer with a seemingly fearless daring, his teammates Sgt. Sanborn and Spc.Eldridge are more concerned that he is a \\"cowboy\\" that may increase the danger to themselves, which is already considerable.  They are operating in pure survival mode, while their new boss seems to be in a different, potentially dangerous, mental and emotional zone.    Jeremy Renner's Sgt. James is not an easy read either.  Is his daring approach really recklessness or does he have a more realistic assessment of the danger and the odds?  Is he simply an adrenaline junky that gets off on the fear and pressure, or is he an accomplished professional that has found his calling and his talent and simply realizes that death is always present, and that error is fatal no matter what precautions are taken?  As has been noted by nearly every reviewer, Renner's portrait of this man is subtle and nuanced and brilliantly achieved.  He is nicely complimented by the work of Anthony Mackie (Sanborn) and Brian Geraghty (Eldridge).    Likewise, these three young leads are ably supported by Bigelow and Boal, who have created an unsentimental script that wastes no time in preaching or in sidetrips or extraneous scenes that do nothing to illuminate these men and the situation they find themselves in.  With a, thank God, absence of pontificating, moral pronouncements, and political bias, they let the sweaty terror of where these men have to work and what they have to do speak volumes about the ambiguity of this war and any other.  This is nasty business, and the tangible hostility of death arriving from any balcony, around any corner, or in any trap is always readily present and felt.    This is brilliant film making, up close and personal in its execution and allowing a terrific showcase for the young talented actors involved.  Yes, there are cameos by David Morse, Guy Pearce, Ralph Feinnes and Evangeline Lily, but they are just that, cameos.  The bulk of this film rests on the shoulders of Renner, Mackie and Geraghty and they are superb.  I've been a longtime fan of Kathryn Bigelow from her Near Dark debut, through her hits and misses, although even the latter have often demonstrated her energy and chops as an action director.  Here she has married that talent to a fine script written by someone who knows what he's writing about, and the result is a fine film with a subtle subtext and arguably one of the best pictures to emerge from the Iraq war.  It should be seen.
1601251505|5.0|What can I say ? I have two bookshelves of 3rd edition material, seven Paizo adventure paths to run, and I want to roll with that.<br /><br />And now, with the PFRPG, there will be ongoing support for the game of my choice. I don't have to ask new players to hunt down PHB on auction sites.<br /><br />The changes are mostly sound, the new rules elegant, one would wish for a few more radical improvements but we must remember about the Backwards Compatibility with all the previous material. And there's a lot of that, because Pathfinder builds upon the D&D legacy from the very first Gygax and Arneson days.<br /><br />The book of great quality - big, heavy, sewn binding, it commands respect. And can be used as household defense.<br /><br />It's a great update and a great way of keeping the 3ed torch burning. Oh and just for sheer cojones of the endeavor, Paizo deserves 5 stars.
0061537969|5.0|What a heart warming story.  It was so interesting reading a book from a dog's perspective at time it almost seemed real.  I loved this book and would recommend it everyone!  Dog lovers it will touch your hearts especially.
B000PHX8C0|5.0|..that hasn't already been said? A full blown assault of razor sharp solos and twin guitar riffs, galloping drums, topped with a creamy layer of the sickest, most guttural vocals you'll ever hear. This album is the sonic equivalent to intercourse.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great Popcorn movie.  If u haven't seen it and you are an action fan, you should.  It wont disappointed. Great movie.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Unbelievable quality for 30 year old movies and just gets better from there.  While watching on a new LED/LCD Samsung 8000 and Pioneer Elite bdp-23fd (IMHO best quality picture in the world), seeing a window on the world 3d effect on the Star Trek movies and HD sound is like a dream.  The resolution, 3d effect, overall picture quality and sound is all better than I could have expected (or even imagined).  I've owned all star trek's since VHS thru Laser and DVD, and now bluray is a very most welcome addition.  Seeing the picture quality improve in these movies over the years is a genuine testament to the amazing progress in technology to deliver entertainment at ever new levels.  Can't wait for the next set and the latest Star Trek!  My highest recommendation for Star Trek fans.
0756405890|5.0|My daughter gave me a copy of this book and told me it was good and I should read it.  Now in our family, I am usually the one that turns my children onto authors. So I felt compelled to start this new author as soon as possible.  It captured my imagination from the first page and I eagerly followed the story until the end.  My greatest disappointment was in not being able to immediately follow this story with another work in the Kingkiller Chronicles.  The characters were well-defined and believable, the storyline compelling.  Finally, I believe that if you like Robin Hobb's  Soldier Son Trilogy or Trudi Canavan's Magician trilogy and prequel, you will love this author.
B00008BXJG|5.0|This Album is one of the best albums ever released by AC/DC. Next to \\"Back and Black\\" this album has some great hits like, \\"Highway To Hell\\", \\"Touch To Much\\" and \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\". All these songs have some great choruses and amazing solos and riffs. If you're looking for some of America's best rock you definitely want to buy this album. I doubt that you'll regret your purchase and in fact you'd probably be interested in the \\"Back and Back\\" album and \\"Black Ice\\" albums as well. Every time I listen to the \\"Highway To Hell\\" album I get chills and just have to crank the volume higher! So, in short, this is one of the best albums you'll ever buy.<br /><br />P.S.  Send emails to iTunes and ask them to put AC/DC in the iTunes store. As hard as it is to believe, iTunes still does not have a contract with AC/DC. Hopefully with enough emails, they will speed up the process.
0345495004|3.0|For a novel whose subject is a passionate affair between our most famous architect in the U. S. and a brilliant feminist who was ahead of her time, the novel is strangely passionless. I think the failure is in the dramatic construction; if it were more like a play with much more conversation and interaction between Maymah and Frank, I think it would have been more lively.  As it is, it is more philosophical  and intellectual than dramatic; I had to force myself to read a certain amount in order finish it for bookclub.  I think the author was constrained by the actual arc of their story which didn't really follow a dramatic line rising to a conflict with a resolution. Yes, the ending is dramatic, but it doesn't do much to add complexity or meaning to the story. I think a lot of women like the story because it espouses a kind of romantic feminism (as opposed to angry male-bashing feminism of the 60's and 70's) which sees partners as soul-mates, with love as the highest value, so high that the\\" truth\\" of the love frees the couple of responsibility of hurting others and places self-actualization above traditional values of home and family. Related to this theory is the notion that rules and laws and made for the average man or woman, and those who are exceptional need not abide by society's codes.  I think in reality that Frank Lloyd Wright was probably a narcissistic personality who needed someone to admire him, who took what he wanted, and that the whole relationship wasn't as ideal as portrayed by the author.  However, I do think that an artist's work should be judged independently of his personality and character. Although he was our most influential architect, he is not my favorite.
0792839749|3.0|Since my grandchildren were visiting in CO, we planned to take them to the stage show of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  This DVD gave them a good preview and made them familiar with the songs.
B00288KNL8|5.0|So I was grocery shopping and after paying for my purchases there are vending machines that rent movies for $1 outside of the store. I was flipping through the choices and saw that Terry Hatcher and Dakota Fanning were in this movie. I didn't see a cover but since I saw their names I thought to myself, Hym, it should be pretty good since these two are in it.\\"    Well, I didn't know it was an animated film geared towards children 11 years old and up. As a 38 year old male I thought to turn off the DVD after realizing it was one of those animated films. But I thought, \\"Why not?\\" and a continued on with watching the movie while enjoying my freshly baked sausage pizza (my reason for the grocery store visit - to buy dinner!).     Even though it's a movie geared toward the younger crowd I thought the movie was still very good. Very creative and a good story line. I thought the lesson was good for children which I interpreted as \\"All things that appear sweet and perfect on the outside aren't always what they seem.\\"
B0028K3192|5.0|What can one actually say about this man and his talents? This man has a way of doing his thing, tellin about it, and then admiting that it's alright for a man to admit falling head over heels for HIS WOMAN! WHOA! Another one that my husband and I can't get enough of. He's coming to Chicago in October and I am going nuts as to our being able to obtain tickets for his concert. THis man also should be given the title of Artist of the Year as a male, and included in every last award show (except country). This man is truly like wine, he continues to get better with the passing time. What's next? OMG, just drifting.
0962477060|5.0|When reading this, I sometimes wonder why I paid so much to go to music school.
B00006AW2J|5.0|I bought this when it came out in 68, but I RETURNED it to the store because my 15 year old ears couldn't stand most of the country tracks. There were only two outright rockers: Sympathy and Street, at least to me back then. Country music seemed like the lamest possible thing to me then and to hear Mick's ridiculous attempts to sound country only added to my disdain. Flash forward to today. I finally listened to this again and, of course, was blown away. Not only did the country rock sound fine, but I was totally taken by some of Charlie's hard drumming on Parachute Woman and maybe Jigsaw Puzzle, which I didn't appreciate back in the day either. Oh well. Live and learn. I've jumped on the bandwagon for one of the best Stones' records ever.
B0006HBZXS|3.0|I'd never heard of this. Was it any kind of a hit in theaters? I thought the bear scenes were a bit cheesy, especially when the bear lands on a spear wielded by 70-something Anthony Hopkins. Baldwin is his usual smarmy self. The whole thing is a little unrealistic, in that these guys would have frozen or starved to death long before they finally trap a squirrel, which they then don't bother to eat as they huff their way, barely clothed, often soaking wet, through Alaskan wilderness for mile after mile, hardly ever slowing down. Also, I laughed out loud when they appear in perfectly tailored bear skins after slaying the bear. How did they sew them together? The skins, freshly removed from a dead bear, would have been soaking wet with blood and gore for days or weeks, in reality. The David Mamet dialogue is pretty good in parts. I never learned the exact relationship between the two rivals, Hopkins and Baldwin. In all, a somewhat entertaining watch.
B000M343BM|5.0|This review is for \\"Major League (Wild Thing Edition)\\". Beware that Amazon groups together reviews for similar products, such as the various releases of \\"Major League\\".    Executive summary: this movie ROCKS!    How can you not like a baseball movie that major league baseball players love? Watch the DVD extras to find out more about that aspect.    Charlie Sheen pitched in college and it showed in his pitching in this movie. James Gammon was spot-on as the gravelly-voiced field manager and is one of my favorites of the movie. Bob Uecker got to spread his wings and say all the wacky things he wishes he could say on his Brewers play-by-play broadcasts, coining some phrases that have woven their way into the fabric of American life over the years. \\"JUUUUUST a bit outside, he tried the corner and missed\\".    This version has the extra features that show what went into making the movie, how the actors got goose bumps when they took the field to a packed ballpark cheering for them, and all the other behind-the-scenes stuff that makes DVD extras worth watching.    This movie is a keeper. I still find myself laughing until I have tears running down my cheeks at some of Uecker's antics. This one will never get old!
6305428352|5.0|I just wish I knew of more relatively modern movies like this one!  Wish I could give more stars to it, too.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I bought 'Songs of Freedom' as a birthday gift for my husband, he loved it. The fact that a couple of songs do not have the best sound-quality, shows that the set is very original, and faithful copy of Bob Marley's journey.
B001SAHOBO|5.0|The action is incredible.  If you are a student of Wing Chun, you will not be let down.  There are very, very brief moments of wire-fu that I find disappointing, but other than that, it is a great representation of the style.  The part I found shocking was that the story and the acting were just as powerful as the action.  If you are a serious martial arts fan, this is one of those rare movies that you have to buy.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I have used this receiver for a few days now, and I am quite impressed by how well it works. To make it easy to understand, let me mention that the receiver will get a lock within a few seconds even inside my house, and it will also get a very fast lock inside my garage, which is located at the ground level of a 3 floor apartment building. Also, once it gets a lock, it never drops it.    The construction feels extremely solid. It has a magnetized base so that it can be put on the roof of a car (supposedly to improve the signal, although I don't see how that would be necessary.)    Some people have complained about the cable being too short. I do not think that's a problem, due to the fact that you basically do not need to put this receiver anywhere specifically. Also, I'd rather use a USB extension cable if necessary rather than be stuck with several feet of extra cable which I do not need at all times.    Finally, one word of caution: Like I said, the device has a rather strong magnet. I would advice you to keep it away from your laptop (specially the hard disk), CRT monitors, and anything else that might be adversely affected by strong magnetic fields.
1552091090|1.0|One of the most disturbing children's books I have ever seen.  My wife purchased this after rave reviews by people we know.  We both came to the same conclusion after reading it; a disturbing story about a compulsive woman that would never be exposed to our child.      In my opinion, this book has a high probability of causing long lasting subconscious effects on your child.  Please, carefully read and think about the message conveyed before subjecting your young ones to this.  I would argue that this book is not appropriate to read to any child.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|The Matrix (1999) was a great five star sci-fi film experience with a great plot, good acting, great first time special effects and lots of action. The film treated an old sci-fi idea concerning the nature of reality that I first encountered in a 50's book by Arthur C. Clarke.  However, it added a great deal to this idea and provided great appeal with the computer generation by having its hero be a young programmer and computer hacker named Neo.  Neo learns we are all the captives of an Artifical Intelligence (AI) and that our entire world is nothing but an elaborate program. We the people are only permitted to live because the computers depend on us for thermoelectric energy. Way out there but lots of fun.
B00007LTIB|5.0|I don't even know what to say about this album, other than it is such an incredible experience.  This album is the most unbelievable piece of art that I have come across in god knows how long.  It is the first album for as long as I can remember that I was truly astonished the very first time through!
0316113506|4.0|This book is fabulous, and I loved learning all the ways in which exercise can enhance health (particularly brain function) in both normal and clinical populations. However, it loses a star for not doing a better job of citing its sources. I would have loved to look up some of the studies Ratey mentions, but he doesn't provide citations. Nonetheless, this book is definitely worth reading!
1400032717|5.0|This is a wonderful book. It is a fine piece of fiction. The mathematics is first rate. The integration of the mathematics into the fiction is better than any other work that I know of. The overall effect is a beautiful story that any maths fans will find hard to read without the tissue box close at hand.
159102594X|4.0|I loved this book. I thought the characters were great, the action was stupendous, and the world-building was decent (a map would have helped a lot).<br /><br />But the plot was...The plot was...The plot....Hold on. This might take a minute.  Or ten.<br /><br />Around page 400 I realized that all I was reading were introductions to characters. There was no plot!  Each chapter, which focused on one or two characters at a time, was enjoyable enough to keep me turning to the next chapter, but I can't tell you what the plot was.  Everything in the book seems to serve the greater purpose, which was to put the pieces in play for the next book, but this book just introduced everything and everybody.<br /><br />I look forward to book two, but if there's no plot, I'm not going to read more than 450 pages of it!
B00005LK95|5.0|Sometimes you have to go back a ways to find a really decent family movie appropriate for small children.  This one is missing the adult content, language, and disrespect found in most of today's proclaimed family movies.
078322804X|5.0|We all know what a classic this movie is. It has been my personal favorite since it came out, and I was in 7th grade. If you don't have a version of this film you should get one, and this is the version you want.     This \\"collector's edition\\" is nearly half an hour longer than the one that came out so long ago. John Landis (director, and co-writer with Dan Aykroyd) mentions some of the things Universal Pictures had him cut out. They are back in now, and make the soup much more steamy. There are also additional features, mainly interviews with the players from the band. You find out a lot about John Belushi and the making of the BLUES BROTHERS. It's worth the expense, my friend.
0793518326|5.0|Perfect book, very very well transcripted songs from Beatles.  If you like The Beatles and like to play, you can spend hours and hours with the book!
B0029NY9YO|1.0|Even wonder what would have happened if members of a happy-go-lucky band of brothers from the Hitler Youth were miraculously given superpowers?  What if the Justice League of America (the JLA) of comic book fame had been composed of a bunch of psychopaths instead of protectors of goodness, truth, justice, and the \\"American way\\"?  What if they were a bunch of psycho-babbling, pathological, fascist criminals instead, the Unjust League of Fascists (the ULF)?  What if Ayn Rand goose-stepping nutcakes wrote the series instead of writers and illustrators with talent?  Well, wonder no more, because here is your answer wrapped in state of the art special effects and premium quality Dolby surround sound.      The Watchmen are a bunch of confused and confusing apathetic psychopaths whose complete lack of decency and empathy (hence the word \\"psychopath\\") result in their taking up of causes that provide the greatest return on investment, to themselves, sort of like a crime crew with capes.  They differ in their degree of pathology, with the two most \\"super\\" being the most pathological of the pathetic crew.  Of the two sickest psychopaths, \\"Dr. Manhattan\\" is the most irritating of the bunch.  Like the much more likable Incredible Hulk, Manhattan was transmutated by his close proximity to radioactivity, only the radiation somehow combined with his warped view of physics and geek physique to produce a radioactive, arrogant, obnoxious, condescending, expressionless, pseudo-science and psychobabble spouting version of the Nazi's ubermensche; a superman that glows in the dark and who can frustrate and bore you to death with his delusional irrationality, which he and the dimwitted around him mistake for profundity.  He wanders around nude, or semi-nude, because he apparently works out and takes radioactive roids when not honoring others with his super presence, and wants everyone to see the results (see \\"arrogance\\" above).    The movie tries to convince us that its two ubermensches with the uber-mostiest commit their various atrocities because their superior intellect allows them to see the bigger picture, while the rest of us are limited to our small-screen view and mistakenly see crimes against humanity instead.  This is basically the same defense given by all criminal psychopaths suffering from empathy-free delusions of grandeur, and falls flat on its Dr. Manhattan-like expressionless face here, too.    I wished I hadn't watched the Watchmen, and you shouldn't either.  What a pathological pantload.
B000JIHP88|5.0|I bough this mobile even before my son was born, and I played it to him since the very fist day. At first, I played the rainforest sounds only; I thought the melodies were kinda sad. However, when my son was about 2 months old, I started playing the melodies as well, to attract his attention. He would stare at it with delight and kick his legs in excitement. Even now, when he's 6 months old, it still catches his eye;although now he prefers being held up high to be able to touch the toys attached to the mobile.  I don't agree that it's not loud enough. The quieter mode is great to use in the evening, and the louder mode was just enough for us. Also, I don't know how often you people play the mobile during the day, to complain that you need to change batteries all the time. I have had the mobile for a little over 6 months and I change batteries twice! (Maybe those of you who complain about it should take your baby out of the crib sometimes and spend time with him, instead of making him listen to the mobile melodies all the time?!!)  The bottom line is that I loved it, and what is more, my son loved it! It's a great mobile worth it's price.
B00288KNL8|5.0|We decided to rent this movie to see whether or not we would like it. After watching it four times, we decided we defintely needed to buy it. I love stop motion films, and this one was excellent.
B001QTXM5Y|1.0|I have nothing against noir, but that seemed to be the focus of this movie to the point where I lost interest in the first ten minutes, which seemed to be one big dragged out scene showing the blood on the street trickling onto the smiley face button. Outside of that, I can't remember a whole lot about the movie as I fell asleep within the first half hour. I woke up, watched a bit more, fell asleep again. We finally turned it off and never finished it. It was that good!<br /><br />I'll give the director points for noir, but as for pacing and plot and just keeping it interesting, this is one of the worst I've seen in a while.<br /><br />Not recommended.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|'Gilmore Girls' may be one of the most original family drama series on this little thing called the TV. Really, my only gripe with the show is that it's not in wide screen--which really isn't saying anything about the show itself; it'd just be nice to see a little bit more of Stars Hollow. The writers are smart, and I love that they use that intelligence to give us some smart women. Perhaps even moreso, I love that the intelligence of the show goes to show that indulgence in popular culture isn't for the simple minded. Like some other favorites of mine (namely 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'), 'Gilmore Girls' provides plenty of role models for both men and women, boys and girls. Role models for the girls should be self explanatory, but the role models for the guys are what I'm more interested in since that's my personal gender (by both birth and choice, if I had a choice... which I didn't, but still). Luke is great--he's independent, he's a \\"man's man\\", he's a normal guy--and his friendship with Lorelai--a smart, independent, unconventional, loving mother--is a great example of men respecting women for their good (non trashy) qualities.<br /><br />Anyway. That's my little free-association of what I like about Gilmore Girls. I haven't been through the whole series, but I'm currently on my way thanks to the complete series collection.<br /><br />Pros of the set (not necessarily a review of the show)<br />+ The Box itself (not in terms of the graphics) is great. The season folders are easy to access.<br />+ The episode guide is very useful; you can easily find which disc contains which episode.<br />+ The folders that contain the seasons have nice pictures on them; the pictures look very sharp, and the patterns (colors, sometimes even print that looks like a fabric) look very bright and really 'pop' off the page<br />+ Gilmore-isms. I find myself wanting to use it more and more; I haven't used it much yet, but I flipped through it and it contains succinct little blurbs of information for each of the pop culture references--on top of that, the guide tells you which episode contains said reference.<br />+ Cheaper than tracking down all the individual seasons (not taking into account promotional sales)<br />+ Takes up less room on the shelf when compared to the individual sets, and makes for a nice display<br /><br />Cons<br />- Cardboard slots can be hit or miss, but a Discgear selector can be an alternate storage method. (I have two of these, holding my Buffy, Angel, Alias, The O.C., and Gilmore Girls sets, as well as some trilogy box sets: [[ASIN:B0015A70O8 Discgear Selector 100-Disc HD Disc Storage System - Black]])<br />- Where are all the pictures? I'd have preferred to see more pictures (including behind-the-scenes) in the episode guide<br />- Although the box is neat, it's difficult for storage depending on where you want to put it. If your shelves aren't high enough, you'll have to store it sideways.. but then the picture is sideways, and it'll look strange.<br />- No bonus DVD with new bonus materials. I don't know what they'd have put out, but it'd have been nice to see something similar to the extra disc that came in the 'Buffy' or 'Alias' complete series sets. The regular release special features were nice but fairly short, and it'd have been nice to see a special retrospective cast roundtable, or even some gag reels.<br />- The package design is okay, but it doesn't seem to fit with the show. I'm only up to season 3, but I don't understand the white background and the pastel colors. Plus, the design team used the front cover image on both sides. A little redundant. They could have at least used different pictures of Lorelai and Rory to put on the spine. Furthermore, the back is completely blank (there was a piece of paper stuck on the back but is mainly only used as a \\"sales pitch\\", showing prospective buyers whats included in the set).<br /><br />Overall, my gripes are slim. The set was a great deal, I inspected most of the discs and although they look a little scratchy, none of the scratches look to affect playback (I've seen many DVDs and as such it's safe to say that I can gauge these things fairly accurately).<br /><br />This set will be sure to entertain for a long time. It's a show that the whole family can watch together and be entertained without being embarrassed. (Watching an R rated movie with the parents rarely goes well).<br /><br />Final grade: A- for the lack of a bonus DVD and the odd cover design.<br /><br />UPDATE 1 September: One of the discs on my set would not play. None of my DVD players could read it, therefore I couldn't watch the episodes (it was the last 2 episodes of season 4). Luckily a friend of mine has the sets, otherwise I'd have been out of luck. I'm still ecstatic with the set, and the show, but it's something to consider. I've since tested all other discs and there aren't any problems.

B001RIY4WE|3.0|Not exactly blu-ray quality, it looked more like an up convert. I would probably just stick with the DVD here.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I went to the show, but these discs are better. The sound mix is awesome. Eric & Steve get better with age. I have the 1969 Hyde Park/Blind Faith DVD; no contest; of course the sound equipment today, is lightyears ahead of 1969.  The guitar playing from both, & their voices shine brightly.   Great show!

1932100660|3.0|I have not read this, but I have read enough reviews to get the gist of what the author is trying to convey, and that is a vegan diet is the healthiest and the Chinese diet proves this.  However, the Chinese are not vegans! They love meat, but they don't eat near the amount of meat westerners do. I have lived China for years and I work in a Chinese restaurant were I eat with my Chinese co workers everyday. I would say that 30% of most Chinese dishes are made up of meat like chicken, pork, or beef.  But I think most Chinese living in the U.S., the ones I know anyways, believe that Americans eat way too much meat and this is why we are so unhealthy.    Anyways, I think the title of this book is a little misleading. It's very very rare to find someone in mainland China that doesn't eat any meat at all.
B0029XZODY|5.0|What can I say about this show?<br />I truly believe this is currently the best show on TV and it is currently Showtime most watched show. I do not like that Amazon review the show True Love which in my opinion does not hold a candle to Dexter. In this season Dexter finally makes a true friend, who knows about his \\"Dark Passenger\\". The season finale is truly almost as good as the first season finale. And the 4th season is probably going to be even better than the first,(which I consider to be the best season of any show ever) based on the Comic-con preview.<br />I read that the first episode of the fourth season got leaked online, but Im going to wait to watch it in Showtime for the truly awesome HD.
0553381407|5.0|Controlling, selfish, hurtful, manipulative, emotionally abusive, verbally abusive, sexually abusive, dishonest, lack character or are generally just not nice, this book will HELP YOU!!! Do yourself a favor and read it. I actually read it because my in-laws sexually abused my wife. It helped her so much that I read it as well and it helped me gain so much sanity, closure, and stability in my life. It is a must-read if your parents or in-laws are anything but good people inside. It doesn't just show you how to behave, it explains why THEY do what they do...the insight is invaluable. God bless you, Dr. Forward. :)
B0020NH94A|5.0|I am still in recovery from full body neuropathy, usually I just call it essentially paralysis.  I found this book to be very informational in my own recovery in my fifth year. It helped me add more clarity to the struggles that I have been going through. I also thought the book was very helpful in understanding what a friend is going through in her recovery after her brain surgery where there was a leakage that occurred. Caregivers and patients alike will benefit from this very well written book.  I breezed through it in one sitting.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is epic filmmaking at its best: a film that realistically depicts the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1971, a generation's defining moment that launched America into the conflict known as World War II.<br /><br />Winner of  a well-deserved Oscar for special effects, the film's production qualities are still impressive after all these years.  There's no CGI here, just the carefully choreographed battle sequences, with REAL plans flying and exploding and intricately-designed models, portraying the battleships that were attacked by Japanese pilots.<br /><br />The cast of Japanese and America character actors do a remarkable job of portraying a somewhat balanced look at both sides.  Kudos go out especially to veteran George Macready as Cordell Hull, Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel, Wesley Addy as the determined Lt. Commander Kramer, So Yamamura as Admiral Yamamoto, James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, Shogo Shimada as Ambassador Nomura, and Jason Robards, Jr. as General Short.<br /><br />Neville Brand, himself a highly-decorated WWII veteran in real life, gets to deliver one of the film's most memorable lines.  In one brief sequence, the film also pays tribute to Dorie Miller, a black soldier who managed to fired heavily artillery at several of the attacking plans, even though he had no formal training in the gun's operation.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's score is appropriately subtle and dynamic.  Surprisingly, and wisely, the producers and the director chose to present the attack itself sans music.<br /><br />The three documentaries included in the set are totally engaging, providing background on the making of the film as well as the historical date itself, respectively.  Also, Richard Fleischer's commentary is fascinating as he details the creation and filming of the 1970 film.<br /><br />\\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" is not just a testament to fallen soldiers and the attack of sixty-eight years ago but to Hollywood's attention to detail in telling a historical event.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Bladerunner was based on Philip K. Dick's novel \\"Do Android's Dream of Electric Sheep\\". Was Deckard (Harrison Ford) an Android too? This question was left unanswered, but various clues indicate that maybe he was an android, such as Deckard's unicorn dream matching up with the origami unicorn found at the end by Deckard. Did the police officer(Edward James Olmos) know something that Deckard didn't know about himself. One of the androids (Sean Young) asks point blank if he has ever given himself the test, but he never replies.<br /><br />The 1968 novel is actually quite different from the movie in many ways, such as with the drug dependancy of the central characters in the novel. In the novel Decker and the rest of the human race is obsessed with collecting either real or lifelike robotic animals. In Decker's world it is considered a status symbol to own a real animal, but those without the financial means settle for robotic animals. All the while people are constantly regulating their feelings and emotions by plugging themselves into machines, thus the humans have developed a symbiotic relationship with machines just as advances are being made to create androids that are ever more human like. In this crossroads with the future humans and androids are virtually the same, but this threatens the humans' belief that they are unique. In this context androids have no rights, since androids are made by humans. Thus bounty hunters like Decker make their living chasing down runaway androids. In an ironic twist Decker kills these intelligent and emotional androids in order to buy a prized living animal.<br /><br />This darkly atmospheric film establishes the stage for many other sci-fi movies to come. And in this blu-ray set we get the first theatrical versions (1982), plus the director's cut (1992), and now the final cut (2007), which has the Deckard voiceover deleted, as well as numerous never-before-seen shots, improved special effects, and added lines. There is even included a working copy of the film. This 5 disc set has it all. Now it's time to start rereading all of those William Gibson novels, like Neuromancer!opy of the film.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|Had to own this series. The writing, characters, and acting are superb. Walter White and Jesse Pinkman play off each other's unique world views. Bryan Cranston's face is very expressive; when his mouth is an open, gaping maw it is fear personified. This is gripping drama. Season 2 is in my shopping cart now.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|What can I say.. I know that maybe I can not be so objective because I am a huge Radiohead fan.   It's a smooth respectful creative dreamy touch of modern alternative music to your soul that you cannot escape from its beauty. Also I oftenly listen to this album with it's B-Sides which I love to do. B-Sides is also incredible.
0307266303|5.0|I cannot remember the last time I read 300 over pages in less than a week. Born to Run is such a page turner. The stories were fantastic and the information shared about running were excellent. Not all are new to me but it provides a lot of information about running especially those who are prone to injury. Very inspirational to read about folks who run 100 miler barefoot, battling the elements.
B001QTXM5Y|3.0|First of all: this is a really cool movie and a great Director's Cut. I really love it and therefore immediatly ordered this DVD.     BUT I'm a little dissappointed about the extras... I expected more for a \\"Two-Disc Special Edition\\" than a couple of Journals I've already seen on the internet months before theatrical release, a music video and a featurette. There's not even the amazing trailers on the discs.     I'm pretty sure there is way more extras to come but I guess those will only be available on the ultimate edition... nice way to get the money out of our pockets :-/
B000063147|5.0|This album has everything a great album in this vein of metal should have; it's a nice long dose of loud, hard, fast energy. The heavy guitar riffs can be both complex and catchy at the same time, and don't even get me started on how crazy The Rev is on his drum kit! Some of his playing on this album rivals even the mighty Brann Dailor of Mastodon! *gasp* I personally consider Brann Dailor the best new metal drummer of this decade, so I'm giving The Rev a big compliment. Anyway, back to the album...    Now before getting this album, there is something all readers should know. As great an album as it is, it does lack the blazing, incredible guitar solos of something such as \\"City of Evil\\". There are two solos on the album, though, a powerful, majestic solo on the intro \\"To End The Rapture\\" and a beautiful and passionate solo during \\"Warmness on the Soul\\". However, don't let the lack of Synyster's wild shredding turn you off to this album, it's an underrated gem.    Most of the songs are mid- to fast-paced and are consistent throughout. However, the band does have the class to write the song \\"Warmness on the Soul\\" which is by far one of the best and most beautiful ballads I've heard in a long, long time. I wouldn't be surprised to hear it be a few people's wedding songs! But the rest of the album is indeed heavily influenced by European metal, with both the riffs and M. Shadow's amazing, hardcore voice.    While you won't find as much of M. Shadows's clean singing or Synyster Gates ripping out his blazing solos, this high-energy album is one for the books. At first I didn't think much of it, but after a while I relistened to it and realized what a metal gem this is. Don't miss your opportunity to get into this beast, go to the store and get this now! Thanks for the time, and peace.

0307269752|4.0|If you are looking something slightly different from the usual Michael Connelly/Nelson DeMille/John Grisham page turner, you might give this a try.  Although the international spellings, the Swedish names and the occasional translation bumps are sometimes distracting, the book generally reads well.<br /><br />The Vanger family mystery was excellent and held my attention throughout the book.  The Wennerstrom issue served as a vehicle to make the Vanger story plausible, but I felt it was poorly developed and took away from the ending of the book.  The perspective provided on Swedish life was interesting.....especially for a second generation Swedish American.<br /><br />I will probably read Larsson's follow-up book, but after that I will happily return to Michael Connelly, Daniel Silva et al for my crime novel entertainment.

B00004YZFR|5.0|Most of the negative reviews I've heard/read about this film were from people complaining about the quality/quantity of music performed.  There's not a lot of it, and some of it is not of the best quality (several songs are truncated, either by violence or to preserve the film's pace.  The Stones are clearly rattled when they perform at Altamont, too; they're looking around like they're scared they might be killed).  There are some quite good performances by the Stones in the beginning, to set the film up.  But that's not really what it's all about.    I'd almost consider this one more a horror film rather than a concert film; it was certainly horrific to witness everything going wrong.  The beatings, the deaths (there were 3 accidental deaths that weren't recorded), performers being assaulted...all from an event that was supposed to be about spreading good will and good times.  You can blame the Hell's Angels if you must, but the film dissaudes you from even doing that.  There's a call-in in the beginning in which an Angel angrily addresses how they were misled.  Accounts vary, but what he's saying is more or less correct.  You can even see one of the Angels' bikes get kicked over; the owner grimaces and attempts to put the handlebar back on his expensive machine (interestingly, this guy isn't one of the ones who reacts with violence).  These possessions defined who the Angels were; the hippies were defined by their rejection of possessions.  Their juxtaposition was explosive.    You see Mick Jagger go from invincible Rock Icon to singing like he's about to burst into tears.  You see Marty Balin of the Jefferson Airplane get knocked unconscious.  You see savage beatings with pool cues.  You see people half out of their minds on drugs.  You see a possible homicide.  Depending on how you look, you might see the death of the 1960's.      It's a powerful film, though it tends to provoke different reactions from different people.  I won't go into detail of mine, but I will say that there are always consequences for your actions.  If you're going to do something on this scale, you'd better do it carefully.  If you live your life like you've got no responsibilities, you will be reminded.  There's obviously more there than that, but it's a start.  You should definitely watch it yourself and draw your own conclusions.

B000RF7XYO|1.0|The history in this movie is bad, even allowing immense latitude to a director for what is after all, intended to be entertainment, not schoolwork.  However, a director who is so insensitive as to use Elgar's well-known and evocative \\"Nimrod\\" from  the Enigma variations as a major piece of background music for high Eliabethan drama has no sense of history, no appreciation of music, no ear for appropriateness, no esteem for the audience, and no feeling for the period (Elizabethan England was, after all, rich in music).  And that's the problem: a lavish movie can't survive aa director who chooses to be incompetent.
B001F290E4|5.0|I recently read an interview with Rod Stewart (who's famous for cover songs) and in it he said he's not trying to making \\"better\\" versions of the songs, but that he's just making \\"Rod Stewart versions.\\" Well, I'm pretty sure that was Seal's intention also while making this disc.<br /><br />If you just take it for what it is, with all comparisons to the originals aside, I think most people, like myself, will really enjoy the majority of this CD. I generally listen to the whole disc without skipping any tracks, but my personal favorite is definitely \\"I Can't Stand the Rain.\\" It makes me wish that all of Seal's future releases were soul albums!
0060578793|4.0|Like other reviewers have pointed out, this is a very good, practical survival guide. I purchased this along with two books buy Cody Lundin and all were good. This guide is more of a straight forward reference guide where Lundin's books are a bit more light-hearted and meant to be read from beginning to end. Both methods work and the author puts everything in easy to understand terms and format. You can tell that he knows his stuff and that's comforting to know. The advice is also presented in a to-the-point style that leaves no misunderstandings.<br />This is a very good book for the outdoorsman/camping enthusiast.

0805079831|5.0|\\"Is neoliberalism an inherently violent ideology, and is there something about its goals that demands this cycle of brutal political cleansing, followed by human rights cleanup operations?\\"  -- Naomi Klein<br /><br />In \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" Naomi Klein documents the brief history of Neoliberalism.  Throughout the plethora of case studies it becomes obvious that neoliberal policy is extremely unpopular among the masses.  In order to implement radically free markets, free trade, and massive privatization authoritarian control is necessary.  Authoritarianism has come in the form of outright right-wing dictatorships and popularly elected officials that disregard democracy as soon as their elected.  Behind this authoritarian movement has been Milton Friedman and his disciples.<br /><br />What makes Klein argument unique is her emphasis on 'shock treatment'.  A three pronged approach has been used by governments across the globe.  First, a physical shock occurs (whether it be a coup, economic meltdown, or natural disaster).  Second, a political shock occurs (in the form of radical policy).  Third, a crackdown occurs to make any remaining political resistance impotent.<br /><br />When the shocks are in progress the West blames the democratic resistance as impeding progress.  The perpetrators of neoliberalism, like Friedman and Jeffery Sachs, distance themselves from the violence they have helped promote.  After the shocks the architects of neoliberalism claim that history has vindicated their theory.  Yet in reality everywhere they go drastic increases in unemployment, poverty and inequality follow.<br /><br />Klein argues for a 'third-way'.  Essentially what she outlines is for a mixed economy that has a heavy hand in stabilizing employment and output with a large welfare state.  In other words, 'Twenty-First Century Socialism'.  She sees South American countries, like Brazil and Bolivia, leading the way towards a more democratic world.<br /><br />Nevertheless, her work is far from perfect.  'The Shock Doctrine' avoids economic theory whenever possible.  This is somewhat understandable because it would alienate much of her potential audience.  But it also leads her to oversimplify and lump together very different ideas.  For example, she muddles Keynesianism.  She claims that it inspired FDR's New Deal (which was actually pre-Keynesian).  Then she goes on to use Keynesianism as synonymous with 'import-substitution'.  She continually dances around the role expectations play in economics (the entire theoretical reason for shock policies).  If she just spent several pages explaining the theory of expectations it would have been much clearer to the audience why shock therapy appears justified but is actually flawed.  Finally, her constant comparisons between psychological shock and economic shock border on sensationalism.  This may make the book a more compelling read for the uninformed but it tends to distract from her otherwise serious thesis.rine' avoids economic theory whenever possible.

B00297FEUI|4.0|Great soundtrack. I was expecting it to be similar to the first score but was pleasently suprised to hear otherwise. Very dark sound throughout the whole cd, but yet very familiar tunes.

The book had great characters some new, some only hinted at by the games, great plot and greatly described action.

0757302661|3.0|I had a CS with my first, with no trial of labor due to intrauterine growth restriction. I desired a VBAC with the second one. My mood was very positive, I refused to listen to any birth-horror stories and believed with all my heart and mind that I will give birth easily :-)     Purchased this book and started practicing when I was 7 months pregnant. I practiced daily the relaxation, breathing and other techniques (not all were suitable for me, you have to connect to the technique). I practiced most of the techniques by myself, but my husband knew all the basics and was familiar with all the techniques in the book.    The book is great to release fears associated with birth, it explains how our body works and how stress hormones can hold back your laboring body. The book made me believe in my body, in its ability to give birth.     I was past my due date and went into labor only on week 42, after doctor stripped my membranes (nothing else worked).     Now I will name the pros and cons of the book.    PROs: I managed to relax my body, to stay calm and to breath. I trusted my body and its ability to give birth. Sleep breathing technique was great! It really allows you to rest between contractions.     CONs: the deep breathing technique, during the contraction DIDN'T HELP AT ALL!!! It simply did nothing! As well as other techniques. On my opinion, if the HypnoBirthing method is for real (not only a selling tool), classes need to be taken. THE BOOK IS NOT ENOUGH! The \\"light-touch\\" massage technique is very vague, as well as few other techniques and can not be learned and mastered from the book. I felt the pain, but I could accept it and cope with it.    After laboring for few hours at home, we drove to the hospital when my contractions were 2.5 minutes apart and lasted for 30-40 seconds: 5 hours after I went into labor, I dialated 0.5 cm and baby's head was very high, my waters were stained with meconium, the kid went into stress and the doctor said his head was too large... So, 6 hours after my labors started I had an emergency C-section:  my son was born healthy and hungry :-) His umbilical cord was looped around his neck and his head was really big (as well as the rest if his body). Despite my VBAC failed, I still believe in my body and its ability to give birth, but there are circumstances along the way that we can not control and change.    We must believe and aim for the best outcome, but need to be flexible on the way!    P.S. The breathing technique that REALLY helped was a dog-like breathing (not from the book). But deep, not shallow: deep short inhale - deep short exhale, deep short inhale - deep short exhale... The difference in pain level with this breathing technique was amazing!
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Garbage was one of the more sonically interesting bands to emerge out of the whole 90s grunge movement. Formed by Butch Vig, the producer responsible for Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" Garbage was a creative success which also managed many times to merge the rawness of grunge with more artistic, even avante garde qualities. And of course there's Shirley Manson, one of the few modern female rockers who's been able to project the kind of authentic rebel character found in performers like Patti Smith, decorating her persona with stylish polishes but never losing her raw, punkish appeal. \\"Absolute Garbage\\" is a strong compilation of some of the more noteworthy highlights of the band's four albums spanning from 1995's \\"Garbage\\" to 2001's \\"Beautifulgarbage.\\" Here are all the hits which offered something fresh on the radio, a sound more seductive than confrontational, with sonic landscapes that sounded like U2's \\"Achtung Baby\\" meshed with Siouxsie And The Banshees.     Many if not all of these songs have strongly survived the test of time. \\"Queer\\" still sounds like a creepy, noirish nightmare while \\"I'm Only Happy When It Rains\\" still feels edgy, with a driving rhythm, snarling yet smooth vocals by Manson and scorching guitars. It easily rivals anything new on the radio today. Garbage was always a great band to listen to because they knew how to tapestries of sound in a way that was simple at times, and yet still very atmospheric, just check out the delicate guitar notes complimenting the dramatic chorus in \\"Stupid Girl.\\" \\"Milk\\" still retains its haunting quality, Shirley Manson's voice beautifully floats over a sea of electronic ambiance. \\"#1 Crush,\\" from the soundtrack to the 1996 film \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet,\\" sounds dangerous, with a poetic, chilling vision of obsession that almost becomes awesome theatrical rock in the tradition of Jim Morrison.    With every new album Garbage became more experimental, but still keeping their identity intact. \\"I Think I'm Paranoid,\\" one of the band's best tracks, has some spacey keyboards and more electronic tweaking than in the first album, but it still features a roaring guitar and an overall enveloping sound. \\"Special\\" proves that Garbage was also capable of producing songs which could be fun sing alongs, it has all the band's classic sonic ingredients but with a more lighthearted, lovey dovey groove.    In 1999 Garbage joined the long list of notable artists who have contributed their talents to that great cinematic tradition: The James Bond theme song. Their turn came for \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" and the title song is a beautiful work of atmosphere where the band proves it could reach orchestral heights. The lyrics are some of the best in the Garbage catalogue. After flexing their muscles with 007, Garbage returned in 2001 with the highly experimental \\"Beautifulgarbage\\" which featured their most radical sonic departures to date. Here we can immediately hear the change with \\"Cherry Lips\\" which is more electronic and poppish, with a rhythm and vocals closer to Blondie. It sounds great, especially with the intricate mix of sounds which give the song a real artistic air. \\"Shut Your Mouth\\" is crunching rock, with Manson at her ferocious best. At the time the album was a turn off to many Garbage fans for its sonic adventures, but today it certainly rivals anything new being released.    The band's latest album was released in 2004. \\"Bleed Like Me\\" was a return to basics. \\"Why Do You Love Me\\" is an exhilarating, punk rock ride that sounds more stripped down, more raw and closer to the band's 1995 debut. The song \\"Bleed Like Me\\" is wonderfully eerie with a very personal feel to the lyrics. But Garbage, always pushing for fresher territory, provide here a new track, \\"Tell Me Where It Hurts,\\" which is glossy pop rock with a great, classic feel. A tune worthy of Debbie Harry, it features lush production and a rich, mature voice by Manson. \\"Absolute Garbage\\" is an excellent introduction to one of the best bands of the 1990s, a reminder of what was and how bad modern rock music has gotten. Maybe the post-90s teenagers will discover something enlightening here. And like most greatest hits packages, one hopes that \\"Absolute Garbage\\" will inspire them to seek out the rest of the albums, which feature real jewels not found here.

B000EG64XM|4.0|George Orwell traveled to Spain in 1936 as a journalist. However, his political views and sympathy for the Spanish Rebublic's struggle against fascism in the guise of General Franco led him to enlist in the militia of the Partido Obrero de Unificacion Marxista (Party of Marxist Unification) or P.O.U.M. While his own political views were communist, his connections in Spain came via an English group called the I.L.P. which had ties with the P.O.U.M. and he concluded that he would first enlist and then later transfer to a unit more closely affiliated with the Communists. Ultimately, his wound and the changing political climate in Republican Spain would compel Orwell to end his service in Spain and literally flee that country after less than one year. Based upon that experience, he has some interesting observations to offer on the various armed forces serving the Republic - as well as the nationalists. He served both in the ranks and as a squad/platoon leader in the frontlines. Although he speaks of \\"trench warfare\\" he also makes it clear that his frontlines were not the continuous trench lines of World War I but more chains of hilltop outposts separated from both friends and enemies by the steep ravines that cut through this hilly terrain. Thus, his frontline experience was more a matter of long hours of bored watchfulness punctiated by raids back and forth across 'no-man's land' and some longrange sniping (his wound the result of such an incident).<br /><br />The resulting experience offers some interesting insights into the Civil War in Catalonia. His service in Spain ended in the wake of the Spanish Republic's supression and arrest of the P.O.U.M. militia and its supporting party as the growing communist influence in Madrid resulted in demands for the elimination of their rivals in the anarchist P.O.U.M. and its militia. In Barcelona in May 1937, Orwell had a front row seat for the Barcelona uprising that became the justification for this suppression and is able to rebut convincingly the communists' description of that event in the propaganda defending the elimation of the P.O.U.M. Force to flee while still seeking treatment for his serious wound at the hand of a fascist sniper, Orwell's experiences colored forever his perceptions of the Soviet Union and the international communist movement as reflected in many of his subsequent works. He wrote \\"Homage to Catalonia\\" and saw it published in 1938, before the end of the Civil War in Spain and this 1952 reprinting has the advantage of his own subsequently added footnotes where he noted errors he had made in his original account and how subsequent events related to or reflected upon the story told here. In this book, George Orwell offers an interesting and informative tale of men at war, of how the war in Spain looked to the men in the 'trenches,' and how his political views were forever shaped by the incidents of this conflict. This is a must read for anyone seeking a better understanding of the civil war in Spain or of George Orwell the man and his body of work.onvincingly the communists' description of that event in the propaganda defending the elimation of the P.O.U.M.

B00004R9A4|3.0|\\"Bed Knobs and Broomsticks\\" is a Disney filler that was between their heyday and the modern day socially acceptable cartoons. It looks like they peppered this film with their bevy of out of work actors and some flat cartoons also tossing in some obscure dancers.<br /><br />The basic story is an overlap of the few simple stories. The main thread is of an apprentice witch (Angela Lansbury) wanting to learn a locomotion spell that should turn the war (World War II England) into a rout. Overlapping this is that she must take in displaced kids from the war-torn city. On top of this she becomes enamored of a street peddler (David Tomlinson) pretending to be a wizard's institution. They confront a nefarious bookseller (Sam Jaffee). Sam does a great job at being quasi-evil; you may remember him from \\"Ben-Hur\\" and \\"Shangri-La\\".<br /><br />After all the which seems to be hours of obscure dancing and songs that kids would never get in 1 million years and grownups would find boring. The film finally gets about 10 minutes worth of action in the end. The action is slapstick but fun.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001JRB16U Mary Poppins (45th Anniversary Special Edition)]]
055380684X|4.0|Daniel Coyle sets out in this book to make a simple and important point: greatness isn't born, its grown. Through a wealth of examples drawn from \\"talent hotbeds\\" throughout the world, he builds a powerful case for this simple assertion. His thesis is well supported, and truly inspiring. He lets us know that, if we are willing to put in the work, most of us can get really, really good at just about anything.    The book is packed with gems: a study that shows that self-discipline is a better predictor of academic success than is IQ; tidbits from the training techniques used at the tiny Spartak tennis academy in Moscow that has turned out as many top 20 womens players in the last decade as the entire United States; and insight into the kinds of practice that build skill fast. It is an inspiring, engaging book, and a very fast read.    At the same time, the book falls a bit short on delivering the last claim in the title: \\"Here's How.\\" While there is a lot of information here about practice techniques, details are sparse and the examples are fairly specific to particular schools and disciplines. At the same time, the general principles that Coyle derives are so broad as to be difficult to apply to one's own training. Will you get some real insight into how to improve your own practice or how to coach others? Yes, definitely. But it is a long, long way from being a how-to guide. In fact, given what Coyle writes the best answer to \\"how\\" might just be \\"get a good coach.\\"    I highly recommend the book for what it is: an inspiring, engaging essay on the idea that talent is mostly a function of what you do and have done, not your DNA. To really figure out how to apply these ideas to cultivate greatness in your own endeavors, however, you will need to go far beyond this excellent book.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|What a disaster.<br />I grew up on Trek and was really looking forward to this.<br />Can we please stop resorting to time travel people?<br />Harlan Ellison let this plot device out of the bottle (in TOS) with an elegance that has not since been matched. Let's leave it be.
B000025K44|3.0|The CD was in good condition. However, I didnt receieve the CD until a MONTH later. The shipping was terribly slow, I had ordered another CD during the same time I had ordered this one, and the CD came the next week, with the same shipping method. I also sent two emails to the seller about this CD during the waiting process, and the emails were never returned.
1416914307|5.0|I have recently become a HUGE fan of these types of novels. This is one of my favirotes by far!!! The forbidden love story is so heart wrenching and gripping and thrilling all at the same time. I would love to live in that magical world. I do admit it took a little bit to get past the first few pages until the story really drew you in, but it was worth it!!! A must read :) I think I'm going to read it again because it was THAT GOOD!!
0312330537|5.0|This book was one of the most moving, beautiful experiences of my life (in terms of books). Gregory David Roberts has a way with words that makes your heart expand at the beauty and gravity of the writing. there were several occasions where I had to stop to write down a passage of the book because I wanted to remember it and refer back to it later. It's not as though I read this book for a class or anything, it was just so phenomenal that by the end, there were so many pages folded to indicate beautiful or moving passages, that the upper corner of the book was considerably fatter than the lower corner.     This is a book about everything. Love, hate, jealousy, understanding, friendship, uncertainty, growth, etc, action, calm, traveling, honesty, crime, mob stuff, war, peace, wealth, poverty, tragedy, joy, hardship. you name it, it's in here. I can't even begin to describe how much I loved this book. I was in the middle of trying to finish final exams and work so it took me a month to read the first 150 pages and then one short glorious week to finish the entire rest of the book.  a week - nearly 1000 pages. how often are people moved to accomplish that? I couldn't put it down. i had to read it in one swallow, and I wish that I could still be reading it. I read it over a year ago now and I still think of it all the time. I think someday I will get around to rereading it because it was definitely the best book I have ever read. it is a MUST READ!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|This review refers to the blu-ray picture quality only.  The movie itself is an absolute classic.  Unfortunately this blu-ray was a victim of considerable DNR and EE that has actually removed and distorted picture detail.  Here's a good example.  At the beginning of the movie where we see Maximus as a General leading a final battle, you see an amazing wide shot of flying, flaming, arrows.  It should look amazing, right?  Wrong.  The picture was DNR'd so badly that it actually removed arrows and the ones you can see are a blurred mess!  Absolutely terrible.  Don't waste your money on this.  Wait until they release a quality blu-ray because \\"this is not it!\\"
0060012358|4.0|Unfortunately other than the mention of Uberwald, I can't remember anything specifically Discworldy about this particular book.  It is interesting and would definitely appeal to the YA crowd, although it appeals to adults as well.  If you're a Discworld completist like me, it is a must, but I would also recommend it on its own merits.  There is logic and normal human behavior in it.  Also normal cat behavior and rat behavior :-)  The mayor's daughter is an idiot.
B000003GBN|5.0|I could not believe that these superb recordings were from the mid-1950's (even before I was born).<br />In this digital era, we have grown so used to the more modern interpretations of these two most popular symphonies of Beethoven (and indeed in classical music). I started off with HvK's, then moved on to Carlos Kleiber whom I like a trival over HvK's. Then followed the 'historical' readings of Eugen Jochum and Cantelli (the No. 7), the 'period' readings of Harnoncourt, Norrington, Zinman, and the truly modern reading of Gunter Wand, but I have not heard Fritz Reiner's until now.<br />I would almost say that the No. 5 and No. 7 here are every bit on par with C. Kleiber's, and even may have a slight edge over it in places, as for instance in the second movement of the No. 7.<br />Well, there is Cantelli's stereo No. 7 that I like very much also and consider even better than Klieber's. But EMI's sound in Cantelli's No. 7 is nowhere comparable with Reiner's in this immaculate set.<br />Miss this one and die.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|For me, the most interesting aspect of this film is the sympathy I had and kept for the \\"beast\\"- for reasons I won't go into here.  Not sure it was intended on the filmmakers' part (I admit not doing research to see...), but there it is.  Closer to Grendel than I expected.
B001AEF6IQ|5.0|I was only a minor Daoctor Who fan as a kid and as an adult i still like the show. When they spun Torchwood off, my original thought was \\"oh great\\", so i sat down and watched the first episode, then the second and all of a sudden I was through the whole first season. The series is fantastic and i recommend ANYONE watch it with the only exception being those of you with closed minds. There is a lot of bi and gay behavior in this series and though I thought it added very much to the plot of the series, there will be people unable to watch it.    I still give it 5 out of 5 without question.
B000002IST|4.0|Although We Can't Dance (1991) is more \\"pop-oriented\\", it does offer up gentle reminders here and there of what it was about Genesis that made them one of my favorite bands. So many reminders in fact, that I generally liked this album quite a lot - in fact, it strikes me as a highly polished version of Duke (1980).<br /><br />Although the tunes are, for the most part, fairly straightforward and pop-oriented, there are suggestions here and there of the elements that signified some of their finest works including Tony Banks chords and the extended \\"studio jams\\" that would turn into some of their more interesting pieces.  There is also an air of melancholy - again, Tony Banks - that color a few of the tracks.  My favorites include No Son of Mine, Driving the Last Spike, and the lengthy closing track Fading Lights.  This last track is excellent and is highly reminiscent of Dukes Travel's (from Duke, 1980).  Tony pulls out all of the stops on the keyboard solos and presents some of his finest playing since...well, 1980.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good album and was the last with Phil Collins as the lead singer.  Although a bit more pop-oriented than I would like, there are still some great moments here and there that made this a fairly enjoyable listening experience.  In fact, I actually enjoyed We Can't Dance a lot more than I thought I would.
0793518326|4.0|Overall, this is definitely worth the money.  The type is small and there were a few minor errors in some of the songs I previewed, but this is by far the most complete and accurate collection of Beatles music I've found.
159448385X|5.0|This book was so moving, I don't even know what to say really.  I felt the pain of the characters in the book, hoping that it just would not be true, that their situations would turn out for the better.  This book is truly a work of art. It made me cry, and wish it wasnt true.
B002IYEQR4|5.0|The Ultimate Edition is rumored to be a 5 disc Blu-Ray release featuring the director's cut version of the film with Tales of the Black Freighter and Hollis Mason's bio Under the Hood intertwined throughout the movie as it is in the original graphic novel. What on Earth Warner Bros intends on filling 4 more discs with at 25GBs each is beyond me. I'm sure there will be documentaries, added commentary, and behind-the-scenes footage, but I'm not certain exactley what it will include at this point.    As a huge fan of the film, I was very upset when I heard the theater release of this version was not going to be available anywhere near me.  Luckily this Blu-Ray edition will allow me to get the full experience at home.
B000M4RG42|2.0|More than ever... the Book is Far Better than the movie.  The movie was a bit disjointed and didn't really delve into some of what made these men tick.  The complexities associated with feelings experienced by the men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima, survived and then went on a war bond tour cannot be done justice on film.  Too much detail is missed.
0061684384|3.0|After reading the other reviews here I was sooo excited to buy this book for my daughter's birthday gift - she LOVES Kat Von D, and we are both tattooed.  I ordered and received it at home in Los Angeles, where I was first disappointed by the fact that I had read other reviews that said the book had a puffed/padded cover, which this one did not... it had a regular hard cover with a nice paper jacket, and so I got over that and took it with me to Seattle for the weekend, and not 2 minutes after my daughter happily started looking through the pages, they began to fall out! I am VERY unhappy about that, and had to tell my daughter that I would return the book to Amazon and see if I could find a copy that this wouldn't happen to.  We both loved the content of the book, but I wouldn't let her keep a brand new book that is falling apart...

0307454541|2.0|Was very disappointed and must say lost some of the time. The book would pick up interest and then dissolve into a quagmire. I even had problems keeping tract of who was who, but that may be because of the unfamiliar names.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|To begin, I'd like to state I love Connery's 007 in the 60's.  But the 80's weren't good to him.  He really looks out of shape in this film.  I'll take Moore 'Octopussy' anyday over this.  The DVD I watched INCLUDES the deleted scene everyone's been stinkin' about in these reviews.  On the positive side, I quite enjoyed seeing the CENTIPIDE arcade machine in its original form.  Yes, I'm an 80's geek!
B0021L8US0|4.0|This movie was pretty good once it actually got the story line going, the beginning is rather boring however, because all they are doing is interviewing people, which didnt have to be a bad thing, but how they started it i didnt even know it was the movie at first..and the people they interview go on rambling for some time.     The story line and everything was pretty good but it kept leaving me hanging at certain parts with unanswered questions.. what happened to the dude at the end? Did he die or get captured? if he died how would the alien be able to keep his promise?      Another thing that kind bugged me was how Humans were able to understand what the aliens were saying, how did they learn that language? Did they just learn it over time? I dont know maybe i think too hard into things, to me it just seemed like there were alot of events that led to unanswered questions.     Overall it wasnt a bad movie..
0375413405|3.0|First of all, I'm a huge Julia fan, have owned this book since 1973, and saw the movie on opening weekend. I have also been to culinary school and own shelves full of cookbooks. I sometimes spend an entire day planning and cooking dinner. I have to say, however, that all of the gushing about this book surprises me. I have a 48\\" professional range and cupboards full of pots and pans, and I often run out of stovetop space and cooking vessels while preparing some of her recipes. I'm of the \\"fine ingredients cooked with respect\\" school of cooking, and Julia most often cooks her vegetables to death, and I'm not sure \\"medium rare\\" is in her vocabulary. Her pastry is to die for, her bread (vol 2) is heavenly, and the chocolate almond cake featured in the movie is one of my all time favorite cake recipes. The instructions in the book are clear, and I'm assuming that they have been updated since my edition was published. By all means this cookbook should be in your collection, but if you're looking for a cookbook with the best sauce instructions, I would choose the little gem from Williams Sonoma that is just sauces with wonderful photos of the whole process, and if you want French flavor with a more modern approach, I'd suggest Ina Garten's Barefoot in Paris. Her beouf is wonderfully tasty and takes just one pot. I'm not a fan of the 30 minutes till dinner cookbooks, but Mastering the Art of French Cooking is not the first cookbook I'd choose for a beginner. And if you're going to eat from Julia every night, be sure to serve French portions as well as French food.
B001N26GFC|1.0|What do you get when you strap a camera to a woman's head and just film her days and nights, then edit it all down to 2 hours? Probably something very close to this movie, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY.<br /><br />The tag line for HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is: The one movie this fall that will put a smile on your face. But it didn't. I checked. I never smiled or laughed or even chuckled. I grimaced twice and cringed once, but I never smiled.<br /><br />HAPPY-GO-LUCKY is very much a stream of consciousness flick. Even as I type this, I am at a loss to tell you the point of the movie. I know it was about a woman, pretty, 30, a school teacher, never married, who lives with her girlfriend, has a troubled student, meets a crazy guy under a bridge, has issues with her sisters, sleeps with a social worker, and is learning to drive from a crazed conspiracy theorist. But I'm still trying divine what it's about. I did work out that the main character, Poppy, is both happy and luck because, in a bit of clever writing she says, \\"I am happy. I'm a very lucky lady.\\"<br /><br />There is really nothing at all about HAPPY-GO-LUCKY that stands out. Not the acting, not the story, not the scenery, not the soundtrack, and especially not the writing - nothing. And when it was over, I felt cheated at having sat through it all with the hope that suddenly the disparate elements would congeal around one moment and I would say, \\"Wow.\\" Sadly, that moment did come but it left me decidedly un-wowed.<br /><br />Now comes the worst part. I saved it for last.<br /><br />As if to confirm my suspicions that I will never ever be invited to be a Member of the Academy, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY was nominated for an Oscar. In addition, it has won awards from all over the world, including a Golden Arena Award at the Pula Film Festival. Yeah. You heard me right. After my review, I'm pretty sure I'll never be invited back to Pula.<br /><br />On the \\"No Country for Old Men\\" scale, HAPPY-GO-LUCKY comes in a tick or two higher simply because Poppy never says, \\"Friend-o.\\"
0375757422|4.0|I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.<br /><br />Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.<br /><br />Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING<br /><br />One of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.<br /><br />Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility.n his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him.

0471267554|4.0|So I haven't started to fully jump into this eating style, but I think I will give it a shot. Loren Cordain Ph.D makes a great case as to what diet us in modern time should be eating - the diet our Paleo ancestors ate.<br /><br />Lean meats, Vegetables, Fruit & nuts.<br /><br />This has to be one of the easiest diets I have ever come across...oh and delicious.<br /><br />The author makes it easy to understand, gives you great case studies and backs it up with a huge bibliography of knowledge.<br /><br />What I loved about it was the menu's that you could use and the charts of food information. You can even discover how alkaline raisins are.<br /><br />Overall I think this way of eating could be really beneficial to me. The symptoms of a bad diet that the author goes over are exactly what I have been experiencing lately in my life.<br /><br />So I will recommend this diet when it starts to work fore me, but I will recommend this book right away. Great information and easy to read.

0143038419|1.0|I'm so glad to know I'm not the only person who thought this book with filled with drivel and sophomoric writing. It was just insufferable.  I can't tell you how many times I had to place the book on my lap just so I could focus on my eye rolling over what seemed like ridiculous fabrications.    Apparently this is a love it or hate it book.  I think that many of the people who hated this book are just offended by the amount of  positive hype surrounding it.  (the power of Oprah and the NYT) It's sad that this is a best seller when there are so many worthwhile books out there.    I am not one who feels I need to learn a \\"lesson\\" from every book I read... or that she \\"should have covered this or that\\"... or whether or not she is \\"shallow\\" --it's her book---she should write it how she likes!  But when I spend money and time reading a book I expect SOMETHING...laughter, adventure, mystery---something!   I don't even mind a trivial little read as long as I enjoy the ride!  This book was forgotten by the time I read the last page.      Unfortunately, I am one of those people who MUST finish a book.  I shall never get back the precious time that I wasted which would have been better spent..... sloughing callouses, dusting...
B001FB55H6|5.0|hi to everybody and sorry for my italian-english! i hope you undestand me..  well, as i said in the title, this movie, in my opinion, would deserve much more stars.  i mean, ok, there is a bunch of ralenties... my left foot cuold be able to act much better then carla cugino... the sex scenes are pretty ridicolous... it's a long and quite slow movie (a kind of Magnolia, if you know what i mean)...so every one star review has its logic, but sometimes i judge a movie from the feelings it gaves me and, well, i just finishd watching itand i still feel shaken.. anxious to watch it again and again!  i read the novel and believe me, i'm really mad about it. to be sincere, i think it's almost impossible to re-create the same atmosphere; even in a three hours movie. but mr snyder made a great job!!  to finish my review just an advice: THIS IS NOT A MARVEL HERO MOVIE!! there is violence (sometimes you could mix it up with hostel!) and bad language. kids stay back!!  so c'mon, love it or hate it!

Definitely get this book if you take any indoor photos where flash is essential.  He makes the light look natural.  And he gives one specific tip that will drastically increase your odds of good lighting.

0446579939|5.0|This was the 1st Nicholas Sparks book I read (love stories are usually NOT my thing) but since movies have been made from his stories, I thought I'd give this book a try.  Very nicely done!  First, his style is easy to read and his story didn't drag on forever with useless details.  Next, I was very impressed that his story included a veteran dealing with the horrors of war and another character who is a dirtbag that uses women - yet this book didn't have one single cuss word in it.  There were loveable characters who made me laugh and I even cried reading this book too.  It had just the right amount of drama, light, funny moments and wasn't overly mushy in the love part of the story.  I'll be reading Mr. Sparks' work again soon!
B000002LEE|5.0|This is the band's best disc. I disagree strongly with the Amazon review that believes the best Jane's songs are on \\"Ritual...\\" While that disc is great in its own time and space, \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" is on a different plane altogether. This band was starving in every way at that time, and this disc captures that hunger. IMHO, there isn't a less-than-great song (save for the throw away \\"thank you ,boys\\")here. \\"Summertime Rolls\\" is a forgotten classic, a tune that I'm sure every purist loves. The raw intensity, creativity, rockmanship, and independence would never again be reached by this band. They were at their paramount here, the height of their powers. If it was the only thing they'd ever done, they would be one of rock's greatest bands. Fortunately for them, they also did \\"Ritual...\\", which cements forever them in rock royalty.

B00006SKRX|5.0|If you've never heard this album, it is a masterpiece. One of the best Waters penned albums. Eric Clapton is just simply awesome and Rogers voice and lyrics will send shivers down your spine. This was the first CD I ever bought about 25 years ago, but it had the ridiculous black censor box covering the blond womans rear end on the cover. I made sure it was uncensored on this one and bought this for my son. We spend hours listening to Roger Waters music. Buy It!!!
0393330435|5.0|Strangely like a cross between a Harry Potter book, with the very short sentences and a drunken conversation with someone who claims to have invented something spectacular but never got the credit for it.<br />But of course Steve Wozniak did invent the Personal Computer as we know it, and he did it by himself. Great book.
B000002ITK|5.0|This is one of the best compilations out there for a band. I picked this CD up back in 1993 when every CD was already out of print (except Stay Hungry). This collection has a great balance of the \\"hits\\" and the \\"nasty cuts\\" such as Shoot 'Em Down and the live tracks. The compilation starts with the MTV hits and just keeps going from there. All the songs are memorable and catchy. This highlights quite a bit from their 2 best albums \\"Under the Blade\\" & \\"You Can't Stop Rock N'Roll\\" such as the title tracks from both as well as the anthemic \\"Shoot 'Em Down\\" & \\"I'll Never Grow Up Now!\\" The live tracks makes you feel like you were there at the show with crushing renditions of \\"What You Don't Know...\\" and \\"Destroyer\\". If you are just a casual fan or looking to get introduced to T.S. then you need to start here. Make sure you play loud and enjoy!

0446402397|5.0|A child killer is on the loose in the Stalinist era Soviet Union. The killer is able to act freely, as officially no crime exists in the state, therefore, such a murderer could not possibly exist.<br /><br />Leo Demidov, is an officer, in the state security force, the MGB. He is a true believer is the Soviet State. However, a series of events forces him to question everything he believes in. As a result, shamed and demoted, he and his wife, Raisa, are sent to a rural backwater, where Leo has to work in the local militia.<br /><br />Shortly, after his arrival, he discovers the body of a mutilated child, in the snow, near the town's railway station. He soon realises that this body is not the only one in the snow, and he has to try and convince those around him, that there is a killer on the loose.<br /><br />I found this book a thoroughly engrossing read. It had me hooked from the start! The writing is vivid and the author really brings home how awful life must have been in the Soviet Union at that time. There are many heart stopping moments, as Leo and Raisa go outside the law and try and catch the killer, against the wishes of the state. I don't want give anything more away, so all I'll say is I hope you enjoy the story as much as I did!
B00001QEE9|2.0|This was undoubtedly Disney's finest work, however the 1999 \\"Gold Edition\\" of Pinocchio is a disappointment.  Not only was this transfer taken from unrestored film elements but they optically enlarged the picture to fill a 16:9 HD screen.  By changing the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio to 1.85:1, they managed to cut off the top and bottom of the picture, resulting in a very grainy image.      With no extras other than the original theatrical trailer, my question is:  What qualifies this to be a \\"Gold Edition\\"?  My advise is, pay a few extra dollars and get the newest edition, it's worth it.

0446691437|5.0|I generally avoid self-help books like the plague, especially the ones with the smug author on the dustcover grinning like an idiot. But this one is in a class of its own, and the only self-help book you will ever need. The reason is that, unlike all the other books which specialize in obstacles in a specific area, this one gets to the root of EVERYTHING that goes wrong when we try to explore an artistic impulse, resolve to make the world a better place, embark on a diet or exercise regimen, etc. The reason for our frustration in these areas is that they all involve what Stephen Pressfield calls Resistance: a force which ironically comes from deep inside us and that tries to prevent us from actualizing our potential, whatever that may be.<br /><br />The first part of the book describes the characteristics of Resistance in detail. While it may sound like yet another piece of psycho-analytic mumbo-jumbo, Pressfield's analysis rings truer than anything else I've read as an explanation for why we are thwarted in our endeavors. The second part outlines Pressfield's solution for overcoming Resistance: what he calls 'going pro'. Professionals, unlike amateurs, play for keeps. They've heard their soul's inner calling and are devoted to creating the conditions necessary for creativity to flow. Unlike people's romantic fantasies about creativity that strikes the artist when she is not looking for it, professional artists know that there is a lot of grunt work that has to take place before the Muse begins to whisper in their ear.<br /><br />Pressfield almost lost me when he started articulating the metaphysics underlying his concept of Resistance. I don't care at all for his quasi-Buddhist view of the soul and his theory of the real existence of the Muses. But the last part can be skipped over without any substantial loss. The rest of the book is just too valuable. Pressfield is an immensely talented, insightful writer who knows what he is talking about. His prose is laconic but piercing, the product of a man who has obviously 'been there' many times. He writes from the vantage point of a veteran in the struggle against Resistance. Before you take up yet again the challenge to lose 20 pounds, write that damn book or make that big change in your life, read this short, marvelous book. I guarantee that it will open your eyes and energize you to know your enemy and successfully overcome it.product of a man who has obviously 'been there' many times.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|One of the great pleasures of Quentin Tarantino movies is the wonderfully inventive casting that he employs.  In PULP FICTION, he revived the career of John Travolta, made Samuel Jackson a star, pushed Bruce Willis into another echelon and even helped get Ving Rhames off to a good start.  In JACKIE BROWN, he burnished Pam Grier & Robert Forster's careers.  In KILL BILL, he reinvented Uma Thurman and reinvigorated David Carradine.  Even in DEATH PROOF, he introduced the world to the amazing stuntwoman Zoe Bell and gave Kurt Russell the kind of part he's missed out on for too long.    And now, wonderfully, in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he's introduced the American viewer to some stellar European actors, namely Melanie Laurent and particularly Christoph Waltz, now an easy favorite for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar.    Tarantino also frequently tries the patience of his viewers with his rococo dialogue and insistence on constantly reminding us that we're watching a movie.  In PULP FICTION, all his \\"habits\\" were fresh and new to most viewers (because, really, how many of us had seen RESERVOIR DOGS before we saw FICTION?), but over time, we learned that Tarantino was often just a little too pleased with his own screenwriting and often too pleased with his own directing.  In a completely off-the-wall piece like the priceless KILL BILL films, everything worked to form a crazy-quilt whole.  In INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, he's too clever for his own good at times.    BASTERDS tells the completely untrue story of how World War II might have ended had a group of bloodthirsty, highly trained American Jews been allowed to infiltrate Nazi occupied France with no mission other than to take Nazi scalps.  Oh, and how that mission needed to collide with one fateful night when all the top leadership of Germany attended the gala opening of a new propaganda film held at a movie theatre owned by a beautiful French girl who was actually a Jew who had escaped a massacre that had taken her entire family and now she's bent on revenge at any cost.  And of how her goal coincides with that of an undercover British agent who just happens to be a German film scholar and a German double agent who happens to be a movie star.    I know that sounds a little confusing.  To Tarantino's credit, the plot as laid out in this 150 minute film is actually easy to follow.  In fact, he's put everything into easy-to-digest chapters.  It does ask us to believe that every important member of the German government & military would all assemble in a fairly public place at one time...but if you can get past that hurdle, there is much vicarious pleasure to be had in watching WWII reinvented by Tarantino.    By far, the best part of the film is Chapter 1.  It features Waltz as SS officer Col. Hans Landa in what is easily the most chilling portrayal of a Nazi since Ralph Fiennes donned the uniform in SCHINDLER'S LIST.  Fiennes role (and that entire brilliant movie) were for altogether different purposes.  Landa comes off more like a Nazi Hannibal Lecter (without the strange dining preferences)...he's a bit of a lone wolf in his own party.  He's feared by all, because he has a wonderful BS detector that helps him root out deception at every turn.  In the opening scene, which plays out like a delicate one-act play, Landa comes to a humble French farmhouse and speaks with the owner.  We know the owner is hiding Jews beneath his floorboard, and we're pretty sure Landa knows it too.  Just how he gets that information, through one of the most tense interrogation scenes you'll ever see, is a joy to behold.  You literally find yourself not breathing.  I leaned forward in my seat.  And yet there is never a raised voice, nor a threatening gesture.  The screws are applied through intensity of manner.  Waltz instantly makes his character a classic.  Tarantino the writer has crafted brilliant dialogue, and Tarantino the director films it all with rare taste and simplicity, and Waltz knocks it out of thepark.      The rest of the film is more uneven.  While Brad Pitt is a goofy delight as Aldo Raine, leader of the Basterds...it's a performance that is more campy than believable.  His Basterds, including folks like director Eli Roth and B.J. Novak from TV's \\"The Office\\" are fairly interchangeable.  And strangely, we look forward to them conducting KILL BILL PT. ONE type mayhem, yet they actually use relatively little screentime showing them in action.  There is one short, effective scene of their own brand of interrogation...but mostly we have to take the word of other characters (like Hitler himself) that these guys are wreaking havoc on the Nazis.     And during one jarring moment, we are introduced to one of the basterds with a blast of `70s era Blaxploitation music and a `70s era title card.   Why?  Yes, it was funny...but it took everyone totally out of the spell the movie was weaving.  Just as having Michael Myers, in thick but unconvincing makeup, play a British officer hatching a scheme to blow up a movie theater, was very distracting.  Myers accent is impeccable, and he plays the part straight...but he's still unmistakably Myers and many audience members snickered when they recognized him.  Very distracting.    It's as though Tarantino doesn't quite believe that he can make a straightforward film and have it be riveting.  Too bad...because when he gets out of his own way (as he mostly does in the climactic sequences of the film), INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS is a cinematic treat.  The gorgeous settings and lovely costumes even gave Tarantino a chance to show off and have it fit the tone of the film...but he still insists on going off the rails.  \\"Hey, this is a Tarantino movie!\\" he seems to want to shout at us.  And this causes him to get in the way of the stunning Melanie Laurant, who plays the vengeful theater owner.  I've never seen her before, and she is an entrancing presence, whether in casual slacks or a gorgeous formal red dress.  She dominates the final portions of the film.    I had a great time at this film, and I recommend it fairly highly.  But with 10 minutes less of the sometimes too clever dialogue and 5 minutes less of Tarantino's showboating, and we might have had a true classic of suspense.  See it, though, because the two performances I mentioned are worth the price of admission...heck, the opening scene is worth it.
B002EDH0FE|1.0|Terrible movie, I can't believe people are rating this garbage so high.  Glad I only wasted $[...] renting this one, I tried to watch it, but after about an hour and half of absolute agony I ended up fast forwarding through the last hour just to scan and see if anything at all of interest EVER happened....it doesn't!  The characters were dull and just seemed to be alcoholics that love to curse for not reason (and these were the good guys). I think about 3 of the heroes superpowers amounted to mega-pottymouth! Lamest movie I've tried to watch in years. Just when I thought it couldn't possibly get any slower and boring, the movie picks up the action by having one of the 'good' superheroes try and rape another one....when that happend that was it for me with this one, these are no kind of superheroes I want to know anything more about, or being 'watchmen' of anything of mine! Definitely not one for the kiddies!
B000URX1DG|5.0|After 125 reviews I'm not sure there's really anything more to add.  I was just a little surprised that even devoted fans seemed to focus on the depressiveness and describe his music as \\"simple\\".  In my opinion, whether or not you appreciate Elliott Smith doesn't hinge on your appreciation of dark or sad lyrics.  The two factors that make Elliott Smith my favorite singer/songwriter of all time are: 1) as others have noted, the brutal and intelligently delivered honesty of his lyrics (sad or otherwise); and 2) perhaps more importantly, the guy had a rare talent for composition.  No one short of Brian Wilson or John Lennon could create melodies as soaring as Either/Or's \\"Ballad of Big Nothing\\" or XO's \\"Waltz #2\\".  And \\"Alameda\\" is so hauntingly beautiful you could just sit and cry to think that human hands brought it to life.  I love the little extra touches: the tin-can, made-in-your-living-room drum sound, the ominous backing vocals (Elliott's voice as well), the harmony vocals in the chorus ... his attention to detail in composition is unrivaled.  Sure, his personal sadness and self-loathing contribute to your appreciation, but only insofar as they enhance the delicate beauty of his compositions.    As for Either/Or specifically, in my opinion, the start of this album is the strongest part.  The first 5 songs could rival the greatest hits collection of almost any pop singer or band.
0061231401|5.0|I've been a fan of James Rollins for a long time. I have to say that when I read the description of this book, I was a little put off because I didn't how how all those disparate elements were going to come together. Silly me! In the hands of anyone else but James Rollins, there might have been a problem, but not in this master's grasp of storyline and characterization. Now that I've read it, I wish I were back in the anticipation stage of just sitting down and cracking open the book, so I could enjoy it all over again. Kudos to James Rollins.
0375413405|3.0|I've only tried 3 recipes so far.  The garlic mashed potatoes are ridiculously good, but beware, TONS of fat.  Her recipe calls for milk, butter, and heavy cream!  I skipped the heavy cream part since it was rich enough as is (and I could only eat small portions at a time because of the richness)!  Going forward, I will have to adjust for the fat content.  The pepper steak was ok.  I would probably season the steak a little more, but the sauce was really good!  The broccoli roasted in butter was also WONDERFUL, but beware, again, the fat content.     Anyway, as I said, I've only tried those three recipes so far.  I'm sure the rest will be good, but I will not be using as much fat as her recipes call for.  One other thing that I like about this book is that it gets you thinking about how to cook, so you can revise her recipes to your liking and come up with your own. So the bottom line (based on what I've experienced so far) is that this will help you learn how to cook, you will have to adjust the fat content, unless you like super rich food, and the food itself is pretty tasty.  Happy cooking. :)
B001GAPC1K|5.0|This is my first Blu Ray disc. I bought it to test out my [[ASIN:B001V9LA44 Blu-ray Player]]. I wanted a modern movie that i saw no more than once and which i could tolerate watching over and over. This was my choice. It has really good graphics and action intensive. I loved it.

B001LMAK88|5.0|Silverado meant the expected return of the Western genre after a brief nap of a decade.<br /><br />After the disappearance of the \\" Duke\\" and the great Giant directors Howard Hawks, John Ford, the Western stood aloof from the big screen. The Vietnam and Watergate affairs literally redefined the development of other genres. While Bronson (Death wish) and Eatswood (Magnum Force) cleaned up the streets, the American Cinema experienced an inward gaze. Films like Deer Hunter, Kramer vs Kramer, Julia or People captured the vital attention of critics and audience, a new generation of directors assumed the role of bringing back the Cinema of its lost brightness Spielberg and Lucas were the new kids in the town and the entertainment industry shone again (Jaws and Stars wars), Ridley Scott (Alien), Coppola (Godfather) and Scorsesse began the nostalgic journey to the far twenty and thirties, the Western was literally struggled by commercial reasons.<br /><br />Since the times of \\"The Wild bunch\\" (1969) and \\"Bite the bullet\\" (1972) we had not seen a memorable and wonderful Western like this one. The Western as well as the thriller experienced a smart transformation, which was the inclusion of small vignettes plenty of humor in order to keep the narrative interest for these new generations.<br /><br />The quartet formed by Kevin Kline, Scott Glenn, Danny Glover and Kevin Costner will have to clean up Silverado. An amusing film that despite the lack of epic visions a la Sam Peckinpah, John Ford or Howard Hawks, got the miracle that eventually paved the way for major films like \\"The unforgiven\\", \\" Dance with wolves\\" and \\"Tombstone\\" during the Nineties decade.<br /><br />A funny and excitement movie,  plenty of action all the way through.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Even if you have seen it online, this is a must own for the singing commentary!  I was just bummed that there isn't a way to purchase a CD of the singing commentary.

B002BFBAWO|5.0|When I went to see this movie, I thought I was going to end up seeing something like Superbad, and though I loved Superbad as a movie about High School, this was ten times better in every aspect.  Maybe its my personality, maybe its because I had been dating a girl that looked like Em (from how she carried herself, responsed to things, and the such), maybe because I was finishing up with college after having started in a Community college because my dad lost his job, and my college fund had to help the family, and then I transfered to a four year state college.  Maybe it was because I had gotten accepted to Columbia for a journalism program.  I don't know.  But not one moment of this film rang false.  I met every solitary character in the movie.  I dated a girl just like Em, I knew a married musician who made up stories of people he opened for (he did eventually open for a band at the Centrum), I have a jewish friend who majored in Russian Literature before going for a Master degree as an archivist.<br /><br />This film was so emotionally real to me, I have waited for its release since it left the theaters.  I saw it six times in the theaters.<br /><br />This is the movie for post college malaise, we all feel it, we all go through it, we're all still just searching for who we are, what we're going to do, and how we're going to become successful in life.  Chasing dreams, finding ourselves, looking for love.  This movie has all of it.  Its funny, its sad, its brilliant, its powerful, its worth every minute that I've sat through it, every penny that I spent watching it.  If you've graduated college, are going to college, want a movie that reminds you of younger days, of jobs you hate, of girls you love, of friends you leave, of chasing dreams, and of following your heart, this movie is for you to watch.  I don't know how to sell the movie anymore than that, and I don't think I should have to.<br /><br />Ignore the previews, ignore the advertising, focus on the movie itself, go in expecting nothing, and you'll come out with everything.  This movie is wonderful, important, and just overall, an everything that I've ever looked for in a film.  It left that sour feeling in my stomach for the girl I lost out on by not going after her, it made me remember those early days when I worked with friends at stupid jobs that I couldn't stand, it made me remember how the things you think are going to be horrible in life, can actually explain your life to you more than everything you think will be great.thing, and you'll come out with everything.

B001JEA7IQ|4.0|This is the revised edition of the book. There are some notable differences between the two, some dubiously good (there are more females... but you can tell that because bows were stuck on their heads, so not exactly a gain for feminism) and some probably not (the vocabulary was watered down).    However, even with that in mind, this is an awesome book for the toddler and the early reader. There's labeled pictures of very close to everything under the sun, in categories, and there's extra text on each page asking questions or asking the child to identify subcategories (for example, on the page of small things the reader is asked which of those things are commonly put on a wall - a great way for mom to get some quiet time while kiddo pores over the book!)
B0028K31CE|4.0|When i first got the album, i didn't instantly love it like i did the other ones he had previously done. However, the more i listen to it, the more i can appreciate his growth and maturity as an artist. Like any artist who has been in the game for awhile, the way you make your music will change a little. We expect so much from him because of his previous albums and it is unfair to think he is going to give us the same as before. I finally watched the 5 days of black disc that came with the CD and that is what helped me take a different look at the CD. My favorite song is Bad Habits and after i watched the video for it, i definately know what the song was about thru his vision. The only songs on the album that i am not big on is Help Somebody and Playing Possum. He has given us what we come to expect from him: a soulful sound with lots of passion. I am glad he's back and i can't wait for the next CD in 2010.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I praise this film for its positive portrayal of the publicly funded health systems of Canada, the United Kingdom and Cuba, and for its negative portrayal of the health care system in the United States.<br /><br />With several personal interviews and American health care \\"horror stories\\", \\"Sicko\\" shows clearly why the United States needs to change its health care system.<br /><br />By highlighting the success of other nations with publicly funded systems, Moore shows that such reform can be successful in the good ole' U.S.A.<br /><br />The video contains plenty of extras - in depth interviews, etc. that provide lots of eye-opening info!<br /><br />Buy two or three to give to your friends and local congress critters!

B001BADN16|4.0|THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a sinfully delicious comedy set in the cut-throat New York fashion industry.  When journalist Andie Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is hired as the new assistant to Runway Magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the stage is set for a a legendary culture (or should that be couture?) clash!  Miranda Priestly--inspired by Anna Wintour, renowned editor of Vogue--is one of the most fascinating characters that Ms Streep has ever played on the screen and she really tries to give some depth to Miranda's life away from the spotlight.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway, fast becoming the Audrey Hepburn for Gen. Y., has another of her trademark \\"ugly duckling to Cinderella\\" transformations with her role as Andie.  Stealing every scene is the amazing Emily Blunt, playing Miranda's flinty main assistant; plus Stanley Tucci as one of the catty Runway designers.  A modern classic.<br /><br />I've compared the Blu-ray disc to the earlier DVD release and the difference is literally night and day.  Extras include audio commentary with the filmmakers and deleted scenes.  This particular BD disc is encoded for playback in regions A through C.

B001LR46HE|4.0|This book on tape was great. It had a lot of things to think about. However, I am afraid that we are pushing our kids too much. We forget that they are kids and creativity comes from allowing them to be creative (play). I don't want our kids to end up like those in other countries who come to our country to get ideas and have difficulty solving problems. What we need to concentrate on is giving our children little doses of what we want them to succeed in, and allow them to become creative as well. The child that is going to school all day and weekends isn't experiencing life. Perhaps she is catching up...we should have some programs and education that puts all on the same learning curve...start young. Twenty-five percent of your brain is wired when you are born and 80% is wired by the time you are three. This is where we are going to make the greatest impact on children. This is where we pay the lowest salaries (childcare workers)...to those who are starting off our youth on the right path...who are creating doctors, lawyers, etc. There is something about where you come from...but there are also temperament types-I would think that temperament types would also be genetic. Everything in moderation and if we want our children to be well rounded individuals...allow for play, give them structure (rules), and most of all love.
0425129608|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book!!! It was amazingly written. I love how the author introduced the story. Hercules Poirot was fantastic.    The book itself was delivered in great condition, shipped in time. You should read this book, you won't be disappointed!
031606792X|3.0|...for I feel this book was the worst, at least in some aspects. The book is so long, mostly because it is filled with unnecessary filler material, like Jacob's book in the middle. Oh my God his book was basically nothing but him recreating the exact same scenes between his wolf pack and the vampire family. It takes like two pages of just him describing himself going between the two, again and again and again. BORING! Everything from Bella's point of view was fine and I enjoyed the romance between her and Edward, although too raunchy for a teen book in my opinion.
1579126278|5.0|Agatha's written is amazing. The whole story is great! Full of mystery and questions that keep me guessing til the end.!    Great Buy! Stop reading this review and get this book! its awesome!    The book itself was delivered in good condition (it had a lot of pencil marks that I had to erase...) but it was in good condition and delivered good.
B001WCN23W|2.0|I agree with the previous posts that correctly note that the new mastering on this CD is much too loud, often bringing the music to near distortion levels. One need to simply compare the waveforms (with any wave editor program) of the 94 Virgin releases with the new remasters. The 94 remasters still leave room for the music to \\"breath.\\" The new remasters don't breath at all...they are in your face the whole time.    Yes, you can hear sounds in these remasters you haven't heard before. And while that is sort of neat (especially in the quieter passages), it's simply because the volume level of the quieter sounds has been significantly increased...while the louder parts have been limited to allow to bring everything to the brickwall without distorting. The end result is something the Stones never originally intended. In essence, it's like some strange sort of remix of volume levels.    And quite honestly, these remasters are painful on the ears. The lack of the dynamics of earlier issues means your ears are getting assaulted non-stop by artificially loud music. The problem is that when you remove the \\"quiet\\" from the music, you also essentially remove the \\"loud.\\" The new remasters ultimately lack the punch of the 94 Virgin issues and sound shrill in comparison (even if the bass is indeed louder).    The good news is that the 94 Virgin CDs should now start showing up used more frequently as fans dump them in the mistaken notion that they are getting better sound with the newest remasters. One should be able to build up a collection of 94 Virgin CDs rather cheaply as a result.
0425200450|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book!!! It was amazingly written. It is considered the BEST mystery book for Agatha Christie for a reason!! they have made movies about it!! ITS SOOOOOOOO GOOD. Keeps you busy.      The book itself was delivered in great condition, shipped in time.
0061231401|2.0|Not only boring but James Rollins ruined a great plot. The conversations between the characters were infantile. The Kowalski character was supposed to add some comical relief but instead he sounded mentally challenged.<br /><br />This book was meant for the MTV-teenagers rather than grown-ups. I think a movie based on this book would have been better-you could just enjoy the scenery and ignore the dialogue.<br />Two stars for the plot, negative one for the book.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is one of the most interesting film I have ever seen.  I am sorry I didn't see it when it came out.
0061245097|3.0|These books are not bad if you don't expect much from them. I was attempting to fill the gap in my life after Twilight and this did not help at all. They are a quick and easy read but extremely cheesy. Definitely not the best writing but are enjoyable if your bored. I would never really recommend them to anyone though. I'm surprised they have such high reviews.
B001FB4VZS|3.0|Smallville has always been a guilty pleasure for me. Usually I don't care for shows that don't have good writing or are too unrealistic. Smallville was fairly well cast and had some great episodes over the years. Unfortunately in between there have been a number of mediocre and downright bad episodes. The show seems to have run its course, and yet fails to ever really resolve anything. Clark is still not Superman, although it seems like he could be, and really should have been by now.   The loss of almost the entire original cast is a huge blow to the show. Carks parents, the Luthors, Lana, and Pete, are all gone. Even recent additions like Brainiac and Kara are off the show. The only initial character's left are Chole and Clark.   I know they want to milk this show for all they can get before canceling it, but the loss of the major antagonists (the Luthors), had left a huge hole in the show. This combined with Clark's infuriating slow journey to becoming Superman, have made this show even more difficult to watch.  There are too many unbelievable storylines, and too many storylines that don't go anywhere and or just seem to be forgotten.  This season seemed like it was going to be the last, and I hope they decide to conclude the show soon and give it a proper ending.
B000O599ZS|4.0|Good delivery and nice price on a film I should have owned long before now.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|Why do serial killers get married? Hell, why does anyone get married? This season doesn't really answer those questions but does appear to be Dexter's strongest season so far. Unlike last season, where Dexter was on the verge of being caught and had Doakes working hard to build a case on him, this season Dexter gets to lay low and have more fun.  His new \\"friendship\\" is the main focus of the season. However the storyline is the same. In each season Dexter meets someone that is willing to be his friend and share his secret with him, and each time he finds a reason to dispatch that person. Its unfortunate as some of these people could have been better utilized over multiple seasons, in particular the new girlfriend from last season. It would have been fun to have seen her brought back occasionally.  Overall this season seemed more polished then the first two.
B00005N5S5|5.0|This has got to be one of the best and most dark sci-fi films ever made . . .  The characters and effects were beyond their time!  By the end of the movie you'll be as exhausted as Sarah Conner herself from all of the action and suspense!  Definitely one of my all-time favorites!
0061774529|5.0|When was the last time you read or in my case listened to an audio book that took your breath away? If it's been a long time, then you're in for a treat.<br /><br />Action, great characters, fast moving plot, twist and turns, tension and suspense all geared to take your breath away and does.  And the quick switches, I found myself yelling at the CD player, \\"No!! Don't you dare!!!\\".<br /><br />My recommendation don't start listening to the book in the evening, because you'll be up until dawn because you won't want to stop. Since I'm retired I put in the first CD early in the morning and before I knew it I spent the whole day listening but it was worth it.<br /><br />My only criticism and it had nothing to do with the book but I really do wish producers of audio books would strongly consider hiring both a man and woman for the narrations - some men just don't seem to be able to pull off playing a female. The tempo is wrong, the pitch is too high, while Fernandez wasn't as bad as some and he didn't ruin the experience but to tell the truth it could have been better.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is by far the best film in the Terminator series, and one of my all-time favorite movies!  Arnold played his role superbly, as did all of the actors.  The effects were way beyond it's time and still look great!  The story was more rich, yet just as dark as the first Terminator.  The entire series could've ended here, and everyone would've been satisfied... Overall, a must-see for any sci-fi/action fan!
0553582461|4.0|I must agree with K. Shaw and with the other reviewers who felt cheated by the ending of a truly great series.  I loved the book, but read the last few chapters with a growing and eventually profound sense of disbelief and wrongness - hence 4 stars instead of 5. When comparing the intensity and depth of the relationship between Fitz and the Fool with the youthful romance between Fitz and Molly, well, there WAS no comparison.   The conclusion of Fool's Fate brought to an abrupt and unsatisfactory ending the complicated, beautiful and continuously evolving love and mutual completion between Fitz and the Fool. I don't think I have ever been SO bothered by a book's ending. The Fool, Fitz, and Burrich all deserved better.     And...what a letdown to give Molly as the final 'reward' to Fitz. Could any reader really consider them to be a true 'match'? Although they had years of happiness with Burrich, both Molly and Nettle seemed to be much more concerned with their being 'victims' of Fitz's long absence due to his supposed death than they were with Fitz himself. Our scarred and valiant Fitz, who for sixteen years has sacrificed and suffered to keep the kingdom safe, now has to grovel for the acceptance of two self-absorbed women? And with THIS Fitz is 'content?' Sorry - but this is too, too unbelievable, and took the heart out of the book for me.    On another note; unless readers have read the Live Ship Trilogy, they will miss out on the pleasurable shock of recognition when Jek, Amber, and Selden appear in Fool's Fate - ESPECIALLY Amber.
B001TODCII|4.0|Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), the non-nonsense hero of Luc Besson-produced \\"Taken,\\" is someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger in \\"Commando\\" without one-liners. He is a gentle father (and retired special agent) who turns into an invincible war machine that no one can stop. After his 17-year-old daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped in the Paris apartment, he flies to France and starts his \\"investigation\\" on his own.    Using the knowledge and skills he had learned in his former career, he chases every suspicious guy and corners him. To save his daughter, he runs and drives in the Paris streets (sometimes in the wrong side of the road); he beats up and shoots anyone who stands in his way. He's got only 96 hours before it is too late, and as I said before, this Jack Bauer-like former spy is played by Liam Neeson.    The 55-year-old Oscar-nominee veteran Liam Neeson, whose previous roles include Michael Collins, Alfred Kinsey and Oskar Schindler, is cast against type as the star of this tense action film. He is surprisingly convincing as a vengeful retired agent trying to rescue his daughter. Well, maybe this is not surprising because Liam Neeson is no stranger to action movies, previously seen in such films as \\"Darkman\\" \\"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\\" and \\"Batman Begins.\\" He has worked with Sam Raimi, George Lucas and Christopher Nolan, and this is a quite impressive list.    \\"Taken\\" wisely focuses on Liam Neeson's character. His charisma grabs your attention immediately, and with his riveting performances, some nice fights and the slick direction from Pierre Morel (\\"District B13\\") the film is never boring. Supporting actors, however, are unmemorable or just annoying. Famke Janssen as Kim's mother and Bryan's separated wife only stands and looks worried before the camera. Maggie Grace (\\"LOST\\") plays the spoiled daughter Kim, who is so irritating.    As far as the major plot holes go, few films can beat \\"Taken\\" (the script was written by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, a writing team for three \\"Transporter\\" films). This is a guilty pleasure you can enjoy only by suspending your disbelief. (Some characters seem to believe Bryan, who doesn't even speak a single French word, is a French police detective.) \\"Taken\\" is 90 minutes of fast-paced, unapologetic escapism and as such it delivers.
1416914285|1.0|When I first started reading The City of Bones by Cassandra Cla(i)re, I felt a tiny inkling of Déjà Vu. I ignored it, not being able to put my finger on exactly what it was, until some time towards the middle when it hit me- reading this book felt like reading a shallow Harry Potter Star Wars crossover fanfic. It had all the recognizable parts of the two stories without having any of the amazing writing, positive messages of love, friendship, and tolerance, strong overlapping plots, great characters and great analogies to mythology and human history. None of that would have bothered me so much if not for this book's other glaring flaws.       I'll start off with the characters, mainly Clary and Jace. Clary is the average, everyday girl, except that she's gorgeous (of course she doesn't know that though), geeky despite never doing anything that would qualify her as a geek, shy despite all evidence to the contrary, and clumsy despite being graceful fighter and showing no signs of clumsiness. Basically, we are told everything about her but never shown anything. Because of this Clary is a very vague character that we know very little about. She's like a catalyst used so that everything can be explained, but she's not really given an identity. Because of that she becomes a Mary Sue. She has a ton of strengths, but no weaknesses that we can see. She barely knows what a Shadow Hunter is and suddenly she can fight, draw runes, and do everything it takes years for the average Shadow Hunter to learn, without any kind of real training. It was annoying. I know it's small but it's one of my biggest pet peeves. It takes years to learn how to effectively use a weapon; it takes months to build up the kind of muscle needed just to lift some of them. She shouldn't be able to just pick it up and use it.       Then there's Jace.  He's an arrogant jerk who looks good and always has a snarky come back. He was another thing that really triggered a strong sense of déjà vu. Everythingabout him seemed so familiar and so annoying for some reason and it really started to bug me. Only when I read who the author was did I realize why he was so familiar. He was exactly like Cassandra Cla(i)re's Draco from her infamous Harry Potter fanfic The Draco Trilogy. He was fanon (fan canon) Draco, a Draco in leather pants- an extremely out of character Draco that is nothing like in the books, but still wildly popular in Harry Potter fanfiction. He was absolutely interchangeable with Cla(i)re's fanfic Draco to the point that the same passages used to describe Draco in the fanfic were used to describe him here. I know there is nothing really wrong with that, but I hate fanon Draco and seeing him outside of Harry potter Fanfiction didn't make me like him anymore than I already did.       Then there's the main villain-Valentine. I half expected him to have a top hat, cane, and twirled mustache. He seemed so cheesy to me. He was like the love child of Darth Vader, Sean Connery, and Lord Voldemort without any of the background, depth, or motive. He simply hated all the downworlders. That's the only motive I could gather for him. I understand that this is the first book, and I should wait for him to be fleshed out some but I felt like it was a very shallow, even for a debut book.       The dialogue felt off in this book. I kept feeling like I was supposed to be reminded the banter between Elizabeth and Mister Darcy, or something like that, but I never was. Instead I found myself rolling my eyes thinking no average teenager would talk like that. The language is too mature for the average teen. I could understand Jace, and maybe Isabel and Alex talking like that, but not Clary and Simon.        The plot was boring. I could see every twist coming a mile away. The moment Jace mentioned not knowing his mother I knew what was going to happen. Just like I knew Clary was going to be bad guy's daughter the moment she said she didn't know who her father was. Cla(i)re might aswell have installed a giant neon flashing sign that said \\"SIBLINGS, VALENTINE'S KIDS!!!!\\" across the page. It was too easy to see coming. Nothing surprised me so I had no motivation to keep reading other than my stubbornness.       The writing also made this book hard to finish. It was so overly descriptive and prosy I half expected the book to start leaking purple goo. We were being bombarded with so much information, from the guys hair color to the info dumps we would get telling us about the shadow hunters, their history, their mythology, what color underwear they wear, etc. There was just too much of it. I felt like I was digging through a mountain of descriptions and back story to find a needle of plot.       Then there's the \\"shout outs\\" in the book. Cla(i)re had this really annoying habit of giving her friend's characters small cameos, or naming minor characters after her friends. It was like watching a movie and in the middle of some important scene Brad Pitt just starts yelling \\"Hi mom! Hi Dad! Hi Angie, BFF's forever!\\" It was stupid. It's fine to give shout outs in fanfiction but not in real books. Save that kind of stuff for your blog, don't put it in your published work. Cla(i)re needs to stop giving secret signals to her friends, and start focusing on how to not make her characters Mary Sues.     Over all I didn't like this book. I felt like too much of it had been done before and that nothing was original enough to keep my attention. Maybe Cla(i)re will improve with her next couple of books, I don't plan on finding out though.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|First off, make no mistake that Quentin Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds is a film that isn't for everyone.  Second, for those that have seen the trailers and clips for the film and have decided that this is a film for them, Inglourious Basterds is something indeed that is absolutely awesome.  Brad Pitt stars as Lt. Aldo Raine, a southern boy leading a crew of Jewish-American soldiers in Nazi-occupied France to do one thing only: kill as many Nazi's as they can.  On the other side is Nazi Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), who lives up to his name as a \\"Jew Hunter\\", and is headed on a collision course with Aldo and his crew.  Also into play is vengeace driven cinema owner Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) and German actress/double agent Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger); all of which ends up culminating in a blood-drenched ball of fire.  Lacking almost any form of subtlety, Tarantino pulls no punches not only in the film's violence, but in the build-up and tension that leads up to its depiction of brutality, and everyone involved seems to be having a blast doing it.  Pitt is wonderful, and Waltz in particular gives a star-making performance that is undoubtedly the highlight of the film.  Even Hostel director Eli Roth manages to make an impression as Aldo's baseball bat-wielding \\"Bear Jew\\".  As said before, Inglourious Basterds is not a film for everyone in the least, but Tarantino's unique mixture of revenge-drama, spaghetti western, and World War II saga is truly something to behold regardless.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|A serial killer who kills serial killers...what a concept!<br /><br />Yet owing to Michael C. Hall's acting ability this series is more than just a re-hash of the serial killer genre.  It infushes the whole character with new life similar to how Bela Lugosi infused the Dracula character with new vitality back in 1931.<br /><br />By rotating their supporting characters, the creators of Dexter have managed to use death as vehicle for giving their show new life each season.<br /><br />In season three Jimmy Smits is recruited to serve as Dexter's sometime friend/sometime foil and in so doing Smits significantly rises above his previous acting product.<br /><br />In the first episode we find a grieving Smits befriended by and befriending the title character Dexter.  The dark source of Smits' grief is only gradually revealed by writers who have the patience to allow their characters to disclose their secrets in their own time and in their own way.  Why the two connect and the result of that connection is a disclosure better discovered by watching the show than any review.<br /><br />But new Dexter viewers can be assured that if they so desire they could start with this season and then return to seasons one and two...if they so chose...because fortunately this is a show which has definately maintained its quality over time.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Season three is marked by less frantic pacing and more nuanced storylines that announces more mature storytelling and character exploration.  There is less blood and fewer laughs, and the payoff is more richly textured relationships among key characters.  Not that blood and black humor are wholly absent.  The description of science as a \\"cold-hearted b*tch with a 14-inch strap-on\\" is unforgetable, for example.  To say much more about the season is to risk spoilers.  I will note, however, that this is highly addictive programming and it's all but impossible not to keep watching and watching, as straight through as one's schedule permits.  So...start on a Friday night, maybe.  It could become a marathon.        Location continues to serve the show very well, and the spicy sprinkling of Latino culture--music, food, Spanglish, etc.--adds to the series' apepal.    And one other quick comment: I think Dexter is part of a fascinating tradition that includes Mr. Spock, Data, Angel (from the eponymous Whedon TV series), Mork, and a handful of others in working to really explore what it means to human.  The existential condition...emotions, morality, meaning, relationships.  Watching Dexter is like getting an outsider's perspective on the human condition, because even though he looks like one of us, her's a stranger in a strange land.
B002DKGWSO|5.0|Two teen girls named Mari (Sarah Paxton) and Paige (Martha Maclsaac) were out in the city to have a good time but when they meet a few crooks named Krug (Garret Dillahunt), Justine (Spencer Treat Clark), Francis (Aaron Paul) and Sadie (Riki Lindhome) as they kidnap the girls. They take them away from the city only to rape and kill them but after the dirty business they seek shelter in the home of a married couple (Tony Goldwyn and Monica Potter) but unfortunately they are the parents of Mari whom have survived and now the parents seek to destroy the maniacs.<br /><br />Brilliant and well done remake of a 1972 cult favorite which was good but outdated, afterall there has been some excellent films of the 70's that have stood the test of time like \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Exorcist\\", \\"Jaws\\" etc. but \\"Last House\\" wasn't one of them. The original was based on Igmar Bergman's swedish arthouse film \\"The Virgin Spring\\" but this one was a vast improvement on the badly acted yet comical at times 1972 version as this movie was serious without a bit of humor. The acting here is just excellent and the original producers Wes Craven with Sean S. Cunningham collabrate together once again to produce this redux but made it better. The rape sequence is as shocking yet more realistic then the one in the original but not as graphic as the 10 minute rape in \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" which was worse then the one here and was better then the 1972 Last House movie even \\"House on The Edge of the Park\\" was better then Last House 1972.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives off excellent picture and sound quality in perfect quality and both unrated and theatrical cuts with only a few extras like behind the scenes, deleted scenes and BD-live, this movie is one of the greatest horror remakes ever and one of the best horror movies of the decade.
0312323867|5.0|this is the second book that i read by emily and it was just as good as her debut book something borrowed. in this story though it  was Darcy's turn. I usually don't form an opinion of characters in books because of course they are not real but i just could not stand her!!! everything was about Darcy and how her friend betrayed her when she did the same thing to her fiance before he did and then had the nerve to be upset at her best friend and fiance! that just frosted me. but of course i had to read it and hate to admit that it was a good read, although i would have chosen a different ending but i don't know how to write romance novels and i guess this is the way she felt it should end. although i'm not in a book club there were some topics of discussion in the end of both books that i'm going to discuss them with my friend who recommended these books to me!!!    i highly recommend both books and they deserve more than 5 stars!!! it doesn't get any better than that!!!
1400032717|5.0|My husband and I read this book out loud to each other on a long road trip.  We laughed outloud and had a great time with it.  My husband is a little OC (obsessive compulsive) himself and is a sometimes very literal person, so he could identify with the narrator.  The book really gives insight into the world of people who think differently and perceive the world in a different way.  Very good for educators and people who work with special people.
0670848352|3.0|Chickenhawk this aint, but still told in Mr Mason's readable style & covers his numerous adventures after leaving Vietnam.   The first half will involve you as much as Chickenhawk - the only thing that brings this book down is that the (SPOILER ALERT) entire last 3rd is set in prison, and after a few chapters of the hum-drum prison routine it get's a bit slow & upsets the pace of the book. If last 3rd had been condensed into 2 or 3 chapters the book would've been better over-all & would've won 4 stars from me.  In a nutshell, worth the read, but last 3rd gets bogged down.    For anyone interested in writing and/or how he came about writing Chickenhawk, it is very interesting reading as he tells us all about this process.
0316017922|5.0|Wow.  What a great book that will change the way you look at successful people.  In the United States, we really love the \\"self-made man\\" theory.  We put these people on pedestals, make them out to be more than they are, etc.    The truth is, people are responsible for where they are in life, but it takes a lot of help to get there.  We really are in this thing together and a lot of things have to come into play for somebody to come out on top.  If you have the right support system in place, a lot of things have to come into play for you to fail.     There are good examples in this book.      Wondering these questions?    - why are most great hockey players born in January?  - why is Malcolm Gladwell's mother where she is?  - why are you more likely to be in a plane crash with the captain flying (rather than first officer)?  - why are asians the best at math?    Lots of interesting stuff in this book.  I am not normally into titles like this.  If I liked it, you will!
0307454541|4.0|You've heard the hype, you've read the rave reviews. On the whole, well-deserved. But exactly how good a thriller is The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo?<br /><br />It's very good, that's for sure.<br /><br />But the title character does not get the attention she deserves until the second book in this mammoth saga, The Girl Who Played with Fire.<br /><br />Here, in vol 1 of the Millennium trilogy, we have just teasing glimpses of one of the great heroines of modern fiction... enough to make us want to buy and read the second volume.<br /><br />But why this careful nuance? Why not rave about the book, like everyone else?<br /><br />The answer requires me to reveal a dirty little secret about the book reviewing racket: most books are bad, and most profesional reviewers would, if they were honest, spend their lives typing terse \\"No Leica\\"-type reviews &agrave; la Dorothy Parker.<br /><br />Commercial pressures - and the need to sound positive, sometime, about something - prevent them from doing so.<br /><br />Thus, a stinker is promoted to a ho-hummer (or even to positive review, if the writer is a friend); a ho-hummer becomes a masterpiece; and a truly engaging novel like this one becomes, flaws notwithstanding, the Book of the Century.<br /><br />Flaws?<br /><br />A leaden style (sharp translation, so the flaw lies with the original Swedish); and characters that are resolutely Northern European in their rationality and coldness. That may be a stereotype but Larsson and his characters, alas, live up to it.<br /><br />Strengths?<br /><br />An excoriating expos&eacute; of all the flaws of the social democratic paradise that many of us imagine Sweden to be: the critique is long overdue, and all the more effective for being couched in fiction.<br /><br />All the above applies, with qualifications, to vol. 2, The Girl Who Played with Fire. In the second outing, however, the title character, Lisbeth Salander, takes over the story. Her extraordinary life and times leaven the flat dullness of these plodding (if at times psychopathic) Swedish schemers. She is a character crying out not just for feature-film treatment, but for a doll, a video game and her own chain of boutiques. A unique and timeless creation.<br /><br />Buy all three volumes.<br /><br />But be aware: someone else will soon, inevitably,  attach a detective-fiction plot to a multi-volume family saga, and will do it even better.

0743454537|5.0|Delivered very fast and the book was actually in better condition than what was described. I forgot it was a used book because it looked brand new!
0061767581|3.0|I would actually give this a 3.5 stars if I could. It is pretty typical of what you would expect from the author. It is basically what she knows, how to be on a reality tv show. The book starts off a little slow but picks up in the end. This makes it so you have to read the next book to see what happens next. The book cannot really stand on its own. It is an easy read though, something I would recommend it to my friends to read when they can just whip right through it, like on a plane ride or something. Pretty much it is perfect for high schoolers who love books like Gossip Girl, and not for people who are in or post college...

B001FB55H6|3.0|I really liked this movie.  I did not know what to expect considering I did not care for 300.  I thought this movie was really well done, very pretty to the eye.  My negative comments come from the fact I did not have the option to watch the theatrical release of this movie on blu-ray.  Has it ever crossed the distributors minds that I might want to watch the regular version and not sit through the extra 30 minutes?  The fact they do not give you the option is ridiculous.  Otherwise, a good lazy afternoon flick.
B001EAWMGA|5.0|After reading many of the reviews on this product, both good and bad, I finally got around to watching the movie.     Are there typical movie cliches here? Yes Is the acting cheesy? While the acting is not award winning it is beleivable. You are still able to connect to the characters and therefore you can feel the story instead of just watch it.    Why does everyone want more Ron Pearlman? His character was just a very basic support character and there would be no reason to have more of him. Honestly I think he should be commended. Ever since he was in Blade and thanks to Hellboy his fame has shot way up. For him to work as just a small supporting character earns him high marks in my book.    I also did enjoy the Moorwen. While it's design was somewhat basic in design it served very well as the movies center. Over all it was a great way to spend 2 hours. I look forward to more from this director.
1400034779|4.0|Don't expect a thrilling mystery with this series of books, but do expect a lot of fun.  I'm working my way through the series and after reading book 3 I can't wait to dive into the next.  The series brings you right into the African region and gives you some insight of how the people live and interact with one another.  I must admit that I didn't even know the books existed until I watched the BBC series on HBO.  Imagine my delight when I found the small town library where I'm spending the summer has about eight of them on the shelves!  I expect that when i read what they have I'll be purchasing the rest.
B00001PE4D|5.0|Cruel Intentions  This is a fun story that takes the audience into the world of rich, spoiled, sophisticated and manipulative young adults.     Loved Reese Witherspoon! Ryan Phillippe played this role perfectly. It's unpredictable and has a great cast and soundtrack. I liked it.

B001O5SXRC|3.0|Arlington Road  The story of a man who seems paranoid that his neighbor is a domestic terrorist.  He turns out to be right. Stars Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins. Worth seeing.

B001VIMCW4|3.0|\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is a hard movie to rate since I really like Daniel Craig as a much more human Bond, but the plot and editing left a lot to be desired.  Craig is very close to the Bond from the Ian Fleming books and plays part very well.<br /><br />The actual composure of the movie is a bit of a mess. It moves very quickly, there are a lot of chases, a lot of shooting, a lot of explosions, and a lot of noise. It unfortunately lacks a strong plot and a villain worthy of Bond.<br /><br />This movie should be seen by Bond fans, if only to keep continuity with the next movie in the franchise, but it is not the strongest of the series.
B002GY9F9K|3.0|I've never read the books, so this is strictly commentary on the series, which is over-saturated with fantasy cliches. There's the humble adopted farm boy who turns out to be the True Heir; Princess Petulant, who can never be with the True Heir because their stations in life are so vastly different; the Wize Old Wizard, complete with knowledge of the True Heir's past and vague, Yoda-like proverbs; and of course the Dark Lord, with powerful magic and aspirations of world domination for which he never seems to have any clear motivation. You also get a Sword of Truth and a Trusty Sidekick, but the Sidekick seems to be making minimal appearances in spite of being featured in all sorts of promotional art alongside the main cast. Eragon, anyone?<br /><br />Throw in plot elements from Star Wars: A New Hope, the Bible, and scenes reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings, and you have a TV series-- if you can keep it. Episodes suffer from terminal overdoses of exposition and an utter lack of humor. The protagonists go from town to town, defending the innocent from tyranny as they stay one step ahead of Colonel Decker-- I mean, the Dark Lord and his Evil Henchmen. At the end, they learn valuable life lessons from the townspeople and ride off into the sunset with Bruce Banner as \\"The Lonely Man\\" piano theme plays in the background. No one ever cracks a joke or smiles, even when ex-Joxer Ted Raimi appears as a magic mapmaker willing to sell anyone his goods.<br /><br />In spite of its problems, it's a watchable show. It has some good fight scenes, New Zealand is a gorgeous backdrop, and Craig Parker is luscious eye candy when they remember to give him some air time. It could be good if they threw in some one-liners and used the cliched elements in new ways to create new stories. If they keep forgetting to add a deadpan snarker and keep sticking to garden-variety sword and sorcery, this series is going to tank. As a fan of Hercules and Xena, I expected better, and maybe this will get better with a second season. Right now I need to go find some comic relief. I would suggest the writers do the same.second season. Right now I need to go find some comic relief. I would suggest the writers do the same.
0545123267|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Lament, Maggie Stiefvater's first novel and Shiver has been on my radar for several months. Werewolf stories are a regular part of my reading repertoire and I was glad to see that Stiefvater was going to contribute to that genre along with continuing to write in the faery genre (Ballad, the sequel to Lament, is due soon).<br /><br />Unfortunately, and for a number of reasons, Shiver didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />Plot Issues:<br /><br />A unique or even somewhat unique twist on vampire, faery, werewolf or other lore entertains me and I love discovering a writer who can weave their own ideas into existing mythology and create a new and believable whole. Stiefvater's idea of werewolves changing shape with the temperature, though, just didn't seem well thought out to me. While we were told that a couple of werewolves tried moving to a warmer climate in order to avoid shifting and that they were unsuccessful (a blast of air conditioning - seriously??), I just didn't get the impression that the pack had put much time or effort into further exploring relocation to another climate or other options. And if shifting from human to werewolf and back again is in any way contributing to the early death of werewolves, you'd think the pack would make finding ways to stop it their top priority. The fact that they continue to live in northern Minnesota where temperature changes can be extreme suggests to me that they have not. And I want to know why.<br /><br />The parental units in Shiver were presented as having little to no parenting skills whatsoever. Grace's parents - who we see the most of - are completely detached from her life; not only are they not nurturing or caring, they're also oblivious. This is Stiefvater's story and if that's where she wants to take us, fine. But I wish there would have been SOME explanation or exploration of just why Grace's parents behave as they do. And I kind of wondered why her father never faced charges for child neglect after Grace was accidentally locked in the car. (Side note: wasn't she nine or ten when this happened? I had some trouble accepting that, at that age, she was so out of it that she couldn't open a car door.)<br /><br />And the \\"cure\\"? Whoa - unbelievably ill-researched (as in \\"not at all\\") and reckless. The mind boggles. Well, at least mine did.<br /><br />IMHO, the plot issues could have been addressed with more careful writing and editing. An editor could have encouraged Stiefvater to insert a couple of paragraphs about how the werewolves had been desperately trying for years to find ways to control their shifting or, if they hadn't, why not. Stiefvater could have chosen to make Grace's parents alcoholics or workaholics or SOMETHING that would, in my mind, have at least started to explain their non-existent parenting skills. As far as the \\"cure\\" goes - I have no idea what could have been done to make that more realistic. Just - none.<br /><br />Writing Issues:<br /><br />I like descriptive passages. I like lyrical writing and the judicious use of metaphors, similes and all that other writery stuff. Stiefvater can do them all and (often) very well. But early on in Shiver, I found myself thinking she was overdoing it. Sometimes, when you go outside at night, it's just \\"dark\\" - and that's good enough. Though the length of this review might imply otherwise, I wasn't taking notes while reading, but the \\"overdone\\" impression seemed to ease off about midway through the story.<br /><br />Each chapter of Shiver is told from either Grace's POV or Sam's. While this did work to give us some degree of insight into the two main characters, I frequently found myself flipping back to the chapter header to see whose head I was in. That shouldn't have been necessary, but the complete lack of character voice made it so. Because character voice adds so much to my enjoyment when reading, I found this to be Shiver's most glaring flaw.<br /><br />Lastly, for a story that should have been FULL of tension, there was a somewhat surprising lack of it. And I can't put my finger on quite why I thought this was the case. And while it was occasionally inserted, I also thought Shiver should have been crackling with sexual tension - young couple, in love, basically sharing a bed every night. But instead the sexual tension seemed, at best, half-hearted. In fact, I wondered a couple of times if all the shifting from human to wolf and back had somehow drained Sam of most of his testosterone.<br /><br />A sequel to Shiver, called Linger, is due in the Fall of 2010.  It's not going on my eagerly anticipated list. While I didn't hate Shiver, it fell short in so many ways that I don't feel I can rate it as \\"OK\\" either. So... 2.5 stars from me. I'm rounding up to 3 stars because I haven't lost faith in Maggie Stiefvater. My disappointment in this book didn't cause me to cancel my pre-order of her next - Ballad, Lament's sequel, which I'm still eagerly looking forward to reading. I think Stiefvater has a lot of talent - talent that admittedly may need a bit of honing - and I am expecting great things from her..

0385340990|4.0|Like many others, I learned in school that the Channel islands had been occupied during WWII, but had never given it might more thought. This novel seemed interesting enough for a summer beach story - and I have to admit that I loved it. I would have given it five stars, except that having so many narrators could be a bit tricky at times to follow. Like Juliet, I fell in love with the cast of characters on Guernsey - and weaving their stories with their individual reactions to books was a treat.<br /><br />For those who love books and particularly like historical fiction, I highly recommend this story.
1416595546|5.0|I saw this book in the Wall Street Journal book review.  Somehow, I missed the fact that it was a novel.  I read almost exclusively non-fiction.  But, since I bought the book, I decided to read it.  Was I glad I did.  The author, Mr. Montefiore, is an expert in regard to the period and location in which the story takes place.  The book is extremely well written and holds your interest.  It is written in three parts.  I should say it holds your interest until about the middle of the middle section, and then the vortex sucks you in.  I reached the middle of the middle section on a Friday evening, as my wife and I were retiring.  Its a good thing she is a good sport.  Even though I was exausted from a busy week, I could not put the book down.  My little reading light and I were up 'til 4am Saturday.  I HAD to finish the book.  WOW.    If you want to know what it is like to live in a totalitarian state, if you want to see the most basic of human emotions cruelly used against people and complete and utter disregard for decency, you don't have to wait for the denouement of the Obama administration or National Health Care, comrade.  You can experience it up close and personal in this gripping novel.  Bravo!
B001EIOOV8|5.0|As soon as the main menu appeared, I instantly realized it was going to be an excellent viewing experience. I am not quite sure how they \\"restored\\" it, but they did an absolutely spectacular job. All of the colors were alive and vibrant and made it hard to believe this film was made in 1995. I personally did not see any flaws in the picture, nor encountered any problems during the film.    The audio transfer had no problems either. As far as surround sound goes, dialogue sounded great with background actions whispering from speaker to speaker and when the action and music kicked in, it was the full three hundred and sixty degree audio experience.    About the bonus features, I watched the few deleted scenes and \\"History Alive: True Crime Authors - Casino With Nicholas Pileggi\\", which was interesting due to hearing true facts as well as seeing photos and live archived footage about the people the film was based upon.    I used my Sony PlayStation 3 for blu-ray format viewing purposes and did not encounter any problems with the disc, film, or features.    If you are a fan of this film, you will not be disappointed at all with this purchase! Add it to your collection today!
B000LAZDQA|5.0|John Cameron Mitchell's SHORTBUS is among on of the best feature films of a different breed.  It is intensely and graphically sexual; but, it's so much more.  It is masterfully performed by a highly original cast.  The collaborative process and the \\"making of\\" features add another perspective.  Real sex, real characters that are flesh-and-blood people that we can relate to on multiple levels.  Highly emotional at points; but, funny, provocative, and philosophically challenging to a variety of individual interpretations of the feature.    If someone thinks this is \\"just porno\\", they've missed the point.  If a person views THE ENTIRE MOVIE with an open, they will be pleasantly surprised at the emotional and intellectual depth of characters fleshed out; and, how everything really does \\"work out in the end\\".    The music is also very inviting.  Photography, music, and acting performance combine to make a movie worth seeing more than once....

0312330537|5.0|Absolute page turner so far...This is a wonderful story about a young man with a criminal mind who sees himself as a Jesus-figure and immerses himself deeply into Indian street culture while on the run.  The author is quick to admit that he is self-centered and mildly suicidal, but he is very likable and is a keen observer of human nature.         The book is filled with fun, intellectual musings about life.  The author is a gentle philosopher outwardly but has an inner beast that needs to be fed with violence, drugs, and on-the-edge living.  He grabs you on page 1 and takes you on an exciting, educational journey into the underworld of Bombay, India, in such a believable way that it reads like non-fiction.  You can vicariously take a dangerous adventure into a foreign country in a way that would be too risky to do yourself.  And it is a wild ride, let me tell you.       Friends who are ahead of me in the book have told me that it takes a turn into Afghanistan at about page 500, where I am now, and that the second part is not as rivetting as the first, but I would buy the book 3 times over for the first 500 pages!  Definitely recommend.  Would love to have a chat with the author.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|If you are a viewer who has patience and maturity to appreciate a director's cut like this, this will be one of your all time favorites. It goes into tremendous detail and, to be honest, it does embellish a bit excessively. However to compare it to the original release, which i have now given away, it is far superior and to any fan of the theatrical version it is a MUST see and MUST own.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I am the ultimate Michael Jackson fan, and I thoroughly enjoy and appreciate his music.  This body of work incorporates Michael's jazzy sounds with his more classic staccato beat.  He can do no wrong musically!  I love all of his works.
0525951113|4.0|Its really nice when somebody who can write well understands their subject.  There were only a few uses of dramatic license to blur technical details.      This is the first thriller I have ever read without a clear protagonist, and one of the few with no romantic interest.  I don't mind at all.  The only low was the gratuitous rape scene near the beginning which I guess may be why Suarez had so much trouble getting this published.  Unexpected in a techno-thriller and totally unnecessary to the plot, I almost put the book down at that point.    A thinking mans page turner.  4.5 stars!

0440244870|5.0|This is the funniest book I've ever read. I don't think I've ever laughed so much in my life :) I try to pass it along to everyone I know. It is full of shopping, girl talk, and romance - I don't think life could get any better. Becky Bloomwood is smart and sassy, but has a fanatical obsession with shopping which gets her in quite a bit of trouble. The rest of the series follows suit, so don't hesitate to read on, but skip the movie, it definitely doesn't do the author justice.
0307454541|4.0|Is this the best thing ever to happen to crime fiction?  No.  Is this a very well put together homage to the 'closed room' classics of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers?  Absolutely.  It's also a testament to his writing that so many people with little prior knowledge of Sweden could get so deep into a book that is so Swedish to the core.  That's because Larsson has written a compelling and unusual mystery, populated by believable characters.  The prose can seem awkward at times, but since I read it in English, that could also be a problem with the translation.  To sum, it's not going to change your worldview, but it will leave a lasting impression and you will soon find yourself recommending the book to others.

1601251505|5.0|This is a new, mostly unchanged version of Dungeons and Dragons 3.5. What's changed from 3.5 is nearly all for the better, in my opinion; additionally, the book is in print, beautiful and integrates well with Paizo's excellent adventure material (primarily the Pathfinder Adventure Paths and the Pathfinder Modules). You can use pre-existing 3.5 modules with considerable ease and most other 3.5 crunch can be adapted relatively easily. Recommended for people that liked 3.5 and want to continue it with a live and somewhat improved game. I like it a lot.
B00008S2VG|3.0|When I first heard the singles American Life, Die Another Day, and Hollywood, I had wondered what the rest of the album would sound but couldn't find it in stores. And no wonder this album is a HUGE let down especially when compared to both Music and Confessions on a Dance Floor. This could have been a chance for Madonna to show the world that she more than just electrobeats and love songs, she could have totally gone the electropop  meets military & politics route that she had opened up the album with on the title track American Life but inside decides to go the Hollywood route with cool and danceable tracks but overall forgettable. Overall Madonna's ninth act was an utter disappoint which of course she redeems and goes beyond on her tenth album.

My family had never seen it before, so we all enjoyed watching it. The overall feeling you get from watching it is good and I like that. Glad I bought it.
0545123267|5.0|I bought Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater on a whim on Amazon.com, not knowing really what the book consisted of. I had a vague idea it had a Werewolf/Human interaction in it and knew right away I wanted to read it.     The second it arrived, I began reading it. It does start out a bit slow, the main character, Grace spends the first few chapters talking about \\"her yellow eyed wolf\\". Her days consist of school, studying, being the adult in the family - her parents, though there,  are non-existent , wrapped up in each other and their jobs. There isn't much said about Grace's social status in school, she has two other close friends, Rachel and Olivia. Rachel is more or less a filler character. Olivia or Olive as Grace calls her, is the question mark in the story. Her part isn't big, and when the story starts out she isn't very friendly. As the story unravels though, so does Olivia, and it's interesting to watch.    And then there's Sam Roth. He plays two parts in this novel, the canine shapeshifter in winter and his human self in spring and summer. The only physical thing that doesn't change for him is his yellow eyes. He's damaged, broken, and impossibly innocent. Hands down, my favorite character in this story. He watches Grace from afar, just as she watches him.     As the story begins Grace explains how she was attacked by the pack of wolves that live in the forest behind her home. She was a little girl then, snatched off her tire swing and mauled by vicous, hungry, wolves. She talks of a beautiful wolf with strange yellow eyes, that protected her in some odd way. She doesn't understand but they connect from that point on, and each winter she waits for him to appear.   When Sam and Grace finally meet - meaning Sam is in his human form - it's through a horrific experience. They know each other instantly, just as they fall for one another. However, it's nearing autumn and the warm weather is disappearing. Both know their time with one another is limited, and Grace desperately tries to keep him with her. The love story, in itself, is poetic and simple.     There's a handful of characters in this novel and though Stiefvater doesn't elaborate on their entire history,  you still feel like you know them, yet there's this bit of mystery that keeps you wanting more. I loved the dialogue, I loved the interactions between each and every character, it all meshed together extremely well. The writing flowed perfectly and I found myself re-reading certain sentences because they touched me so much.     In a time of \\"Twilight\\",  there should be a change and \\"Shiver\\" is it. The characters are drawn with flaws and that's what makes them so likable. It's also refreshing to read both main characters'  points of view. It made the story that much more real.    I'm anxiously awaiting \\"Linger\\" (the sequel to \\"Shiver\\")!
0545123267|5.0|I've seen this compared to Twilight a lot and a couple of the reviews here seemed to really misunderstand a few key things so I decided to chime in. Thus, a few points to consider:    1) The male main character, Sam, is a songwriter and a poet. His \\"voice\\" reflects that. If you think males are limited to, \\"Hurr, yer purty!\\" then this isn't going to be for you.    2) The female main character, Grace, does not hate herself. She does not long to be as good as Sam or as fast or strong or whatever. She does not let school and life and her own goals become absorbed or pushed aside because of her love even though she is in a difficult time-limited situation.    3) Instead of bonding over supernatural things, these two bond over movies and books and food (you know, like most people). Grace isn't special because of Sam. Her sense of self-worth isn't tied up in him.    4) Neither the female nor the male male character are stunningly beautiful. Sam's most striking physical trait was his from birth and has zero to do with his being a werewolf. He has an unflattering nose and floppy black hair, not perfect chiseled good looks.    I'd make a few other points, but I can't without risking spoilers. I would also like to mention that there is a wonderful, subtle sense of humour in this book which I really enjoyed. The prose is lush while still being transparent and accessible. The characters and their relationships have layers which are dynamic, realistic and interesting, especially the issues between Grace and her parents. Also this take on werewolves is fascinating and poignant.     My only negative comments: It took longer than I would like for them to explain why the werewolves didn't just move south, and for the characters to put together a certain main plot point regarding the condition, but it all works and makes sense. I think it's more realistic for this considering what the characters were dealing with. Also it will have a sequel so not all questions were answered in this book.    All in all, I recommend this book on several levels. It's a fast, enjoyable read, and has a sense of fragility - almost a gentleness - to it which is wonderful. Best of all, it has a more balanced take on real, healthy love and friendship than many competing offerings, all without sacrificing the longing and connection between the two main characters. (Ahem. Some of you know what I am talking about here.)
B000001FSU|5.0|Anthrax is an awesome band, and this is a very strong album from these thrash pioneers. Truly underrated album.
0756405890|5.0|I rarely, if ever, write reviews of any kind because I rarely encounter such a gem, especially in a debut novel. Pat Rothfuss deserves all the praise he has received in other reviews and I won't repeat what has been said, but if you're looking for an outstanding read, filled with unpredictable twists and turns crafted by a talented storyteller and excellent writer, grab this book. I have read many fantasy novels over the years -- some I never even finished because of the predictable stories and weak writing; many others I finished but regreted wasting my time; and a precious few I finished and then sought other novels by the same author. Congratulations, Pat Rothfuss, you are in the last category and I cannot wait until the next chapters of Kvothe's life story.

B000021XR5|5.0|I didn't know this album even came out until Jan.2000. I dismissed it as another attempt at a comeback not worthy of even giving it a listen to. However, I was wrong because on this one they finally found their sound. After the first 3 albums they found the right formula with this one. It has the tight production of the \\"Tiny Vatican\\" album, but also the grunge of the first 2 albums. The impressive thing here is Scott Weiland's vocals as he doesn't sound anything like Layne Staley, or Eddie Vedder here. His vocal range is actually good on these tracks. It starts off with \\"Drown\\" which is one of the grunge cuts, \\"Heaven and Hot Rods\\" is some more of the tight production of \\"Tiny Vatican\\". However, the honors go to \\"Sour Girl\\", and \\"Glide\\" as I heard \\"Sour Girl\\" on Real Radio 104 one weekend, and that inspired me to go onto Napster, and check out the rest of the album.I sampled \\"Glide\\", and it was probably one of the most beautiful songs of the 90's. I downloaded it, and burned it onto a cd, and now play it to death. It's also got some other songs like \\"Atlanta\\" which is a ballad that can equal \\"Creep\\" anytime. I don't know if they had any Grammy nominations that year as everyone went ga-ga over Santana's \\"Supernatural\\", but it should've been considered. I don't know if Weiland was over his drug problems, or not by the time this came out, but it does show he was focused. I may actually buy this someday.

B000A88EVE|5.0|a must-see for fans of sci-fi, David Bowie, Nicolas Roeg. if you like your alien visitor stories warm and cuddly, this ain't for you. in fact, almost every character in the movie is totally depraved and sadly human. it doesn't spell everything out for you, either; you have to piece a few things together, but you end up with a rich tapestry by the end of the film. the actors all give spot-on performances, and some thanks should go to Mayersberg's tight, clever script. Bowie's first feature film performance is subtle, diverse, and seems a little detached (like an alien should be), but knows much more than he tells. the curious film-making style is definitely European, but the look of the film is oddly western... as if we were also looking back to the old, rugged American west. the Criterion Collection copy has been remastered, recolored and restored to its full length, so you get the BEST version on the market and mine came with a copy of the original novel, as well. as if you needed more incentive, the movie also has (the late) Claudia Jennings in a small, uncredited role. and if you can't tell the difference between events shown in real time, flashbacks, prophecies or mad visions, roll with them because this is a movie you'll be able to mentally chew on for a long time and like it.    review by astronomius
B000001FTD|5.0|It's albums like this that have kept Thrash metal one of the most powerful, dominant types of metal music ever.  This album is pure metal awesomeness.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It has a whole different feel to it than the other Batman's,  (excluding the first part of this one )     the others were cartoonish.   This is a real suspense with feeling.  The action is great, the acting is excellent, and the movie is scary, not for younger children.    I give this movie 5 stars because it is a new favorite and i can watch it over and over.
0545123267|2.0|Things I liked:     -I loved that it had both points of view in this book. Although I think there was more written from Grace's pov and I would have liked more from Sam's.    -Aside from the dialog the writing has a nice cadence. Almost musical.    -I liked how things like touch and smell was compared to the seasons, summer and winter.    -I liked how Sam came up with lyrics for songs, I especially liked the song he wrote of Grace. Although I would have liked him to play his guitar more.    -The whole concept of the temperature being what triggers the change was new and interesting. I love it when they put a new twist on an old idea.    -I thought Sam was super sweet and caring.    Things I Disliked:    -I thought that both Sam and Grace, but Grace especially, let Beck off way to easily for changing Sam.    -I didn't feel that a whole lot happened, and that the book could have been shorter. I had to fight to finish reading this one, because it just didn't hold my interest. Grace and Sam spend a good deal of time just being with each other and that didn't really drive the story for me.    -I couldn't stand most of the dialog. I would be reading along really enjoying the writing style then someone would say something and it just jerked me out of flow. The dialog felt forced to me. (I am very very picky about this so I am sure I am the only one who feels this way)     -The one thing I hated the most was, when Grace finds out that her Dad was one of the people who were out hunting the wolves, she doesn't really say or do anything. If that were me I would be giving my Dad a very large piece of my mind. That part just made me feel like she didn't love the wolves as much as was supposed to of. Had this part not been in the book I would have rated this higher.    I really really wanted to love this book, but it just didn't grab me in the way I had hoped. I still will probably pick up the sequeal to see what happens though.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Advent Children was sort of entertaining when it was first released about 4 or 5 years ago, but in retrospect it was somewhat of a mess. The Advent Children \\"Complete\\" edition does just that, it completes whatever sort of jagged edges the original left behind. There's actually more of a coherent story this time around, and it is quite enjoyable. The bonus features aren't too much to really gawk at, but they are nice. I felt more satisfied with the completedness of the movie so that the lackluster bonus features didn't bother me too much.<br /><br />Seems like the only way one could enjoy the original version was with nostalgia goggles or fanboy goggles. FFVII Advent Children Complete can be enjoyed as its own entity while also appealing to individuals who are enthused with the franchise.
B002A9OJ0Q|4.0|I, like many of the other non-5 star reviewers, have been an a-ha fan since 'Take on Me' and eagerly awaited this newest release from a group that has never failed to satisfy me.    With 'Foot of the Mountain' I was mildly disappointed.  I'm glad to know it wasn't just me that found the second half of the album a downward spiral.  A common thread in reviews is the \\"return to 80's pop-synth sound\\" which I noticed almost immediately and holds me in a do-I-love-it-or-do-I-hate-it conundrum.  Certainly there are favorite tracks but, as said by others, I don't know what a-ha was thinking with \\"Mother Nature\\" and \\"Start the Simulator\\".    I was continually gratified by each a-ha release (culminating with the extraordinary 'Minor Earth Major Sky') until 'Lifelines' when I just shrugged and thought \\"Huh?\\"  'Analogue' made up for 'Lifelines' - barely.  'Analogue' was a rougher sound for sure and well done I thought, giving new nuance to Morten's deep to lilting vocal range.    All in all I do enjoy 'Foot' and feel, like a fellow reviewer, that this is a 3-1/2 star effort.  However, I will round up to four stars where the other reviewer rounded down.  Aside from the uptempo \\"Riding the Crest\\" which would have wide appeal, \\"What There Is\\" and \\"Real Meaning\\" are my personal favorites as they both demonstrate Morten's vocal prowess.

B001OQCV2Y|4.0|Inglourious Basterds is supposedly about Nazi-hunting in World War II, a revenge fantasy where Jewish-American guerillas (or terrorists, as the Nazis point out) are tasked with spreading fear and loathing throughout France.  Led by the rustic Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt), the Basterds have but one task: to each collect 100 Nazi scalps.  Please note: this review contains spoilers.<br /><br />One might think, given the title and the trailers, that this is an action film filled with the occasional machinegun dialogue Quentin Tarantino is famous for.  It's quite the opposite: a series of measured vignettes in which the tension is ratcheted up to feverish heights, then explodes in quick, messy violence.<br /><br />The opening scene sets the stage: Han Landa (Christoph Waltz), AKA \\"The Jew Hunter,\\" does what he does best in France.  As such, he is the nemesis of spies and revolutionaries hiding in plain sight.  Landa hunts down Shosanna's (Melanie Laurent) family in a terrifying exchange that culminates in the death of her family.  Out of mere whim, ego, or simply being true to his hawk-like nature, Landa lets Shosanna escape.  Her survival will have grave repercussions for the German war effort.<br /><br />These two plots, the Basterds and Shosanna's revenge, eventually intertwine when Hitler and his entourage arrive to view a special showing of a Nazi-propaganda film (Stolz der Nation) in Paris. The film stars Frederick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), a Nazi war hero who singlehandedly killed dozens of enemies from a sniper tower.<br /><br />Tarantino never just makes a film to tell a story, as evidenced by the obvious digressions from history he takes with Basterds. He films a vibe, an expression -- in doing so, Tarantion comments on the nature of the cinema and our own humanity.  And this time, he's aiming his camera at the audience.<br /><br />You see, this film isn't just about Nazi hunting, or Pitt's funny accent, or the tension between agents who know their social repartee will end in blood; it's about violence in the movies and how we glorify it.  And Tarantino is merciless as he judges every person involved with the film guilty:<br /><br />The producers are guilty: Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) is a simpering suck-up who is far too enamored with the approval of his audience to see how vile his film is.<br /><br />The actors are guilty: Actress Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger) is a duplicitous murderer who shoots an unarmed man in cold blood. Zoller, the star of Stolz der Nation, has no stomach to watch his own murders taking place on the big screen but is only too happy to bully a woman with his affections.<br /><br />Even the projectionist is guilty: Shosanna is so consumed with her revenge that only in killing a man does she finally see his humanity.<br /><br />But the most guilty of all is the audience in the theater watching Stolz der Nation. They are shot, burned, and blown to bits at the end.  That was the goal, of course - to kill as many Nazis as possible, right?  It's just a goal that doesn't seem quite so laudable if you happen to be a member of the audience.<br /><br />From the images of soldiers dying in the Nazi propaganda film to the graphic scenes of Nazis being scalped, Tarantino holds up a mirror. Are you enjoying this, he asks?  Because if so...<br /><br />You're the basterd.e movies and how we glorify it.

0385341008|5.0|If you have not heard of this book, and you are a lover of fiction, I would like to encourage you to pick this up.<br /><br />The story, if you haven't heard or read other reviews, is told in letters. Juliette is the central character - she is a writer who wrote a hugely successful column during World War II. The war is over, and she, by a strange set of coincidences, has begun a set of correspondences with people from the isle of Guernsey, which was occupied by the Germans for 5 years during the war.<br /><br />I learned a great deal of World War II facts, and more than that... the feel of the war, and the after-life of it, from this book. I also grew to love almost all of the characters. I had sincere reservations - reading a book whose whole format was letters? - but it worked. It REALLY worked SO WELL that I wish it had never ended.<br /><br />I don't know if there are comparisons to Austen out there; there are certainly enough allusions to dear Jane in the book. But if any modern books are the heir to the feel of Pride and Prejudice or Mansfield Park or Emma... this one suits the bill.<br /><br />(*)>
0756603749|5.0|I have been very pleased with the quality and clarity with which this book is able to teach and demonstrate knot tying. Describing the motions required for tying a specific knot, which are often confusing, using only words and pictures is obviously very challenging. This book does a remarkable job. The high quality color photographs and step by step, ( turn by turn if you will ), directions where essential for my learning. Someone took a lot of time and planning in producing this work and it shows. On the rare occasions I encountered difficulty in producing the knot displayed, a very careful re-reading of the text and more attention to the photographs accompanying each step resolved the difficulty. The book is compact and very durable. The pages are thick and glossy with high quality text and photographs at the different stages of the knot in process.

B001FB4VZS|3.0|Season 8 is the first time that Smallville has left me disappointed.  Every other season deserves a 4 or 5 star rating (or even 6!), but season 8 just didn't pack the same punch.  This season did NOT have the \\"I can't wait until next week's show\\" feel to it.    I firmly believe that the producers originally intended Season 7 to be the finale.  They knew ahead of time that Michael Rosenbaum would not be returning and the script seemed to tie storylines from the previous seasons together through the Veritas plot.  My unsubstantiated guess is that Millar/Gough left the show because it got picked up for this 8th season and Millar/Gough didn't like where the series was going with it's over-arching plot (and, as a result, they were sort of ousted by CW execs due to creative differences).  In any case, season 7 was surprisingly fantastic and the finale left me on the edge of my seat.    Season 8 starts out by disappointing from the get go.  The way to control the Traveler was for Clark to once again lose his powers?  Really?  Again?  All of that build up in Season 7, which was made to sound like the world would end if Lex activated this control, was about Clark losing his powers?  I'm sorry, but Clark losing his powers has happened numerous times throughout the series and was a definite slap in the face to Season 7.      There were some decent things with Season 8.  I like how Kara was brought back for a farewell episode.  I also commend how Lana returned so that they could finish her storyline and not just leave her character hanging.  That said, the whole superpowers equal to Clark idea was a bit much for me (my opinion is that they should have made Clark realize he wasn't truly in love with her), but I was actually ok with how Lana's return was done overall.  I also enjoyed the development of Oliver and his clashes with Clark.    I think Tess Mercer's character was ok - but she simply cannot ever equal the evil that Lex brought.  I truly missed Lionel's character (JohnGlover was the best actor in the series).  Davis Bloome was solid, but the Doomsday part of him (when he actually turned into Doomsday) was underwhelming (especially in the finale - more on that below).  I have problems when they leave plotlines unfinished.  For example, Clark promised to help John Jones, aka the Martian Manhunter, get his powers back after the sun nullified them.  Nothing more ever came of that and, except for one episode, John Jones was ignored.  Also, Chloe \\"found herself\\" by becoming in charge of the Watchtower.  However, she was never really seen performing this new role.  These unfinished plotlines weren't even teased to leave us hanging - they were just never touched again.    The season finale was absolutely the worst EVER for Smallville.  The epic battle between Doomsday and Clark lasted about 2 seconds!!  I don't care that the show didn't follow the comics by not having Doomsday kill Clark, but the whole season lead up to this supposed to be mega-fight, which panned out to be nothing of the sort.  Then Clark shows up and can't remember much of the fight?  That's because there really wasn't one!!  Horrible.  What was with Lois disappearing and time traveling??  The first ring could only be activated by Clark.  I know this was a replacement, but I'm thinking it would be constructed the same way which means I'm not buying her zipping off somewhere (it just seemed like the writers couldn't come up with anything else).  So Jimmy Olsen wasn't Jimmy Olsen after all?  Then why was he named Jimmy Olsen?  Chloe then gives his camera to his younger brother who is the real Jimmy Olsen - so, both brothers are named Jimmy?  That's just bad writing to me.  Clark just walks off to end the season?  Not much of a cliffhanger.  Half of the Justice League shows up but are barely featured (especially Bart, how hasn't been on the show in several years).  Finally, bringing Zod back?  There's so many other ways they could have gone other than to bring back Zod (who Clark has already beaten in Season 6).  Maybe the Zod plot will work out, but I'm skeptical based on how poorly Season 8 ended.    Bottomline, I know the writers/producers were somewhat handcuffed with losing so many of the shows orignal characters (after all, only Clark and Chloe remain!).  I also don't mind that they stray from the real comic book story (in fact, I like how Smallville has it's own unique plots).  However, many opportunities were missed and others were bungled in Season 8.  Smallville's move to Friday night for Season 9 is not a good sign and ratings will probably dip (which does not bode well for a season 10).  I will still be watching faithfully though with the hope that season 8 was an aberration from the amazing 7 previous seasons.  Regardless, Smallville will likely always remain my favorite TV shows.

Thank god Robby waited at least one more album before leaving... songs like \\"Electric Eye\\", \\"Take These Chains\\", \\"Bloodstone\\" and \\"You Got Another Thing Comin'\\" are some of Priest's best songs yet. The bonus tracks are a good addition and in total, this album is a must for any metal fan. I know this review is short, but words are not enough to describe how awesome this album is.

Not to mention the theme - MOONGLOW!!!!!
B001PPGAIK|1.0|I love Baz Luhrmann. His vision of Romeo and Juliet was different, yet very refreshing. It translated well to a modern setting, and I've watched it countless times. And Moulin Rouge was not great but it was entertaining.<br /><br />This, my friend is not.<br /><br />Yes I love long movies, but on principle- as long as they:<br /><br />1. Don't Drag<br />2. Stay entertaining the whole way through<br />3. Manage to tell the story in a sense in which a shorter runtime would have been a rush job<br /><br />I enjoyed Watchmen, The Godfather, Dances With Wolves, King Kong 05, and others on that Principle. ESPECIALLY Dances With Wolves. That movie was 3 hours long yet it only felt like 2 hours. When a movie that's over 140 minutes drags, gets boring in some bits, and rely on just being long (The Horse Whisperer, Inland Empire, and the recent Funny People), not a good sign. Australia is one of those movies.<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this movie- Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman who are two of the best actors, and Luhrmann. I rented it om Blu-Ray the day it came out. ANd then I watched it.<br /><br />About 96 minutes into the movie I was already checking my wristwatch. THen 140 minute mark, I think it's over. Turns out it's not. 150 minute mark, it's over. 152 minute mark, it's not. 159 minute mark, the credits are finally rolling. Wow, a story so thin and weightless lasted THAT LONG?<br /><br />The movie is a complete joke, and for several reasons.<br /><br />First off, this film is basically an extended remake of The Notebook. And while I wasn't crazy about The Notebook either, at least it had good acting and a good plot. This has good acting, but that's where it stops. The plot is confusing and hard to follow.<br /><br />Second, the length- 3 hours. The same story could easily have been told in two hours or less. But no, Luhrmann had to insert 5 minute shots so he could flesh it out.<br /><br />Third, the best thing about the movie, Nicole Kidman, was SEVERELY underused. She is a beautiful and undeniable actress, she has the abitlity to pull off any role. But she wasn't used enough.<br /><br />Oh, and the CGI overdose. This movie is the Die Another Day of Romance films. 60% of all the settings, props, etc. is CG. It's completely distracting.<br /><br />In short, this is one giant, long, boring, and confusing mess of a movie. Luhrmann should seriously retire before he's ever allowed near a camera again.role.

1594488916|2.0|In a narrative told alternatingly from the viewpoint of the criminal and the person tracking him down, the author tells the story of a particular individual's fascination with rare books.     Or at least that's the intent. Unfortunately, the book does extremely little to convey why old books are interesting, and if you know anything at all about old books you will learn absolutely nothing new. The information presented here about the importance, interest, and terminology of rare books is less than I explain in one 90 minute lecture class to my students.     What the book does do is give a very blurry snapshot of the rare book selling milieu in the U.S. today, and a lot of explanations of how credit card frauds were perpetrated in the late 1990s. You also get a fuzzy portrait of a book thief, but beyond the explanation that the man appears to be a sociopath little additional information or analysis is presented. So the work is also not very satisfying as an offering in the genre of true crime.    All in all a disappointing book that will be of interest only to people who know nothing about rare books or high level crime. It's been done better before.

B0021L8US0|4.0|There is a tendency to view science fiction films that deal with ordinary problems of human existence under a prism of allegory.  Thankfully, DISTRICT 9 does not go that route as it takes an undercurrent of racism and uses it not to suggest a subtext of meaning beyond the film but to internalize it as yet one more gripping ingredient in a film loaded with them.  Director Niell Blomkamp uses a narrative that mixes interviews from the past and present of the film with a plot that begins in moral confusion but ends in ringing clarity.<br /><br />Twenty years ago, a huge spaceship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. After a waiting period, the authorities cut her open to discover its occupants, a race of beings that have faces that remind the viewer of Schwarzenegger's Predator and a lizard-like lower torso that smacks of grim reality even though it is a computer generated series of images.  These aliens are a ragged bunch, hungry, sick, and leaderless.  Their leaders all have died in transit.  The South African government places them in a quarantine that rapidly becomes a slum, where they are forced to live a squatters' filthy existence.  At this point, the viewer might think that Blomkamp is using his craft to make a statement about the Meaning of Racism.  Such a blunt appraisal is premature.  What gradually emerges is the story of how one ordinary government worker is faced with the reality of one small group of immigrants (even in the millions) is faced with hostility from a much larger group that prides itself on open dialogue but still is replete with those who see the newcomers, called Prawns, as nothing more than a subjected minority that must be endured or exploited.  This government worker is typical of the \\"good citizens\\" of white South Africa.  He is full of prejudice but thinks he is not.  Slowly, he grows in moral stature as he comes to see the Prawns as distinct individuals with rights that must be respected.  These rights are not respected, and a race is on to exploit them in ways that will benefit the white majority.  Without giving too much of the plot away, I came to see things through his eyes and the eyes of one of the Prawns, one who began as an adversary to the worker but quickly began to co-operate in a way that requires co-operation as the means to survive.  There is plenty of racism to go around.  The film presents Nigerians as loathsome gangsters and government security forces as racist thugs.  All senior government officials are slimy in their self-serving oiliness.  The government worker who is the lead and the Prawn who befriends him emerge as the moral centers of the film.  If one overlooks the science fiction rationale and the CGI effects, what remains is still a terrific film that uses racism not to beat up a racist society but to hold up a movie that can stand on its own in a manner that all quality films can: gripping directing, solid acting, and a respect for the viewer's intelligence.on to exploit them in ways that will benefit the white majority.

B001TODCII|3.0|The plot of this film is a third person sanitized version of \\"Lilja 4-ever.\\"  Bryan Mills'(Neeson's) teenaged daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) travels to Europe where she is stolen and sold into the sex trade.  The film was rated PG-13 but its content, vaguely glossed over for the most part, is anything but.  Quite graphic, the film relies on assumption, bloodless gunfire, and knife fights to push home the point that some people will justify any action to make money. The light treatment of such a horrific crime is somewhat an insult to the film's message. Given its themes the film would have been stronger if it had gone with an R rating, or at least more artfully hinted around disturbing content.  As it was it fell flat in engaging the audience into exactly what was going on, choosing to focus on pyrotechnics and paramilitary posturing.<br /><br />Neeson is not on his game in this role, though he delivers a powerful, decisive father whose drive to save his daughter rivals the darkness of those he pursues.  This is the real story.  What is happening to his daughter is an afterthought, as is his own emotional involvement with what's happening.  That lack is why the feasibility of the story falls apart.  Grace portrays seventeen-year-old Kim more as if she was fourteen, rarely taking a step that she isn't skipping and pouncing like a puppy.  The need to convey her as being innocent and naive is overdone.  The only thing missing was pigtails.  Between the vague content and the over-acted archetypes of powerful father and innocent daughter, the result is this film turns a traumatic experience into an action-oriented thriller, his daughter's story largely lost beside his campaign for conquest.
031606792X|2.0|This book made me want to cry, and not in a good way. I love the story of Bella and Edward, I read all the books in 4 days. But when it came to this one, all the build up it had going on in so many parts of the story to end up with a big fat nothing, was quite dissappointing to me. It gets really dark during the birth of RENESME (imagination fell apart in all aspects of this name by the way) The love story and suspence that sucked you in with the first three books literally spits you out in Breaking Dawn. Bella gets everything she wants and even manages to pop out a halfling kid somehow, Beautiful Jake falls in love with a toddler, Bella's kid is a born Einstein, They prepare for great big battles that never happen and everyone begings to bow down and fulfill Bella's every whim. It is like Meyer was so bored of her own story and just wanted to be done with it. It is a dissapointment and giant slap in the face to Twilight fans. It leaves you feeling like you've been left at the altar.
B001N44BVQ|4.0|Graphic and deeply entrenched in vividly showing the darkest aspects of terrorism, espionage, and disloyalty, this film is not easy to watch and is most definitely fiction.  Undercover CIA Agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) tries to infiltrate and take down a terrorist faction, accomplishing feats under impossible circumstances that can only happen in movies.  Crowe as Ed Hoffman, Ferris' control at Langley, plays a frighteningly stoic and detached man, equally as removed from his own family as he is the orders he gives to the endangered Ferris in the Middle East.  Both DiCaprio and Crowe give seamless performances.  All of the cast had excellent rapport, which contributed to the film's ability to keep the audience engaged in otherwise very dismal circumstances.  Fast-paced and incredibly unpredictable, the personal details of the characters keep the story grounded and interesting.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|This COMPLETE version of the movie has some new scenes that add about 26 minutes of video. Also many details have been added and revised in many parts of the movie (Personally I don't like the DVD version anymore).  I deeply recommend this BD to anyone who likes this movie (and much more if you also liked the videogame); If you can get this version and watch it on an HD display it will blow your mind.
B001KVZ6F2|4.0|Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't.  Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted.  The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one.  Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone.  She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it.  The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy.  The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off.  Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power.
0446402397|5.0|Tom Rob Smith delivers in a novel that I loved from first to last page.  The utter despair of Communist Russia, the horrible murders of children, the rise and fall and rise again of the protaganist.  This novel had it all.  I loved this book and can't wait to read the sequel.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Sinfully inspired and darkly delivered, the story is wonderful, the art and animation are divine.  As Gaiman is well known to pen creepy childrens' stories, this one renders wonderfully as a moving picture.  In a decidedly grim parallel, Coraline goes down her own rabbit hole, to find that predictable, boring life with her parents isn't so bad.  The story is one I definitely will enjoy watching repeatedly.<br /><br />However, the 3D version of this film at home was a lackluster experience.  The perspective was slightly off and only a few fleeting times did it gel correctly to actually convey a 3D effect.  For all its artistic quality the 3D version falls short and could easily detract from the splendor of the story.  Stick to the 2D version.
B0026IUOW8|1.0|I don't know what all these other folks are talking about as my download had so many typos it was hard to read the book.  I purchased this for my teenaged son to read.  He was not willing to struggle through all the typos.  The miss-typed words stop the flow of the book and make it very annoying to read.  I tried to read it myself and quickly saw what he was complaining about.  Doesn't kindle know about spell check?
B001PPLIEG|2.0|This is the worst Bond film I've ever seen.  That said, the institution of such brings high expectations.  Opening with an incredibly weak action sequence, the film segu&eacute;s from one action scene to the next with dialogue and context jammed awkwardly between.  The pace was rushed.  The chemistry between characters was pushed or simply not given time to develop in intimate scenes.  Such sandwiching of detail resulted in the constant spewing of information in dialogue.  Conversations didn't seem natural they were so laden with detail needed to advance the plot.  Even Bond's trademark steamy sex scene was cropped of sensuality or intrigue.  The witty humor of Bond, himself, was absent.  The soundtrack was one of the few consistent points of interest.  Had this film been stripped of the franchise and made under a different context it could have stood with some touch-up.  As a Bond film it was awful.
0151013047|3.0|Some responses.    - Changez let lust rule him in his interactions with Erica, possibly leading to the disaster. She was in love with a perfect ghost, and he ironically ended up doing the same.  - In accordance with the above, Changez placed everything on a pedestal --- be it the perfect American girl, elite society, corporate America, and America itself. He recognized that things were not as they seemed (society, class, etc.) growing up in Pakistan, but did not apply the same rules to America?  - Changez is selfish. His lust was already a marker. He gets to come to America, gets a scholarship to attend Princeton, gets a high-paying powerful job, gets some time with a beautiful high-class goddess, but eventually feels the need to fight America?  - Changez is emo and childish. He thinks he is helping his family by giving up the gifts in America (specifically the money) to return to live with his parents in Pakistan all melancholy and angry while he dreams of American girl Erica being right there with him?    I have little sympathy for Changez. Be aware, but be not bitter.    Try \\"Dreams From My Father\\" by Barack Obama.

B001EN71DQ|3.0|No one needs any more reviews on the movies themselves. They're a legacy known to both young and old. My chief gripe with George Lucas is that he's slow to move, and it took forever for these films to become available in DVD. Now it's taking forever to come out in Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The DVD collection is wonderful, but the aspect ratios are different. I don't have a large horizontal monitor, so I'm doomed to watch these DVDs on a thin, video strip that I can barely see. Even on my computer, which does have a large horizontal monitor, I still get a tiny strip because of the horrible ratio; but some movies have different ratios than others.<br /><br />I'd buy all these movies in a reasonable ratio, but they're aggravating to watch on every monitor I've seen them on. The worst ration is 16:9. If you're going to watch it on a television set, be prepared to sit down two feet from the screen if you want to see what's going on. I'm afraid Lucas is going to release all of his films in different ratios when he finally gives the thumbs up on Blu-Ray, and that would be a shame. He's going to have to die before they'll release these movies the way the fans would prefer them, and I may be dead long before then!<br /><br />They are available full screen, but I think most people would want the movies to fit their large horizontal video monitors.
0307266303|5.0|Excellent, well written, engaging book. It is written very similarly to John Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air,\\" and it is just about as good. I read it in just under one week. The book begins with the author's quest to rid himself of nagging injuries due to running (he suffered from foot and ankle problems, injuries that apparently plague between 60 - 80% of all those who run).     The story quickly turns into a series of flashbacks and sidebars discussing topics such as the Tarahumara tribe of Mexico, ultramarathons, the biomechanics of running, the evolution of man from cro magnum to \\"running man,\\" and of course the race in the Copper Canyon between the Tarahumara and the American ultramarathoners.     One minor complaint came to me while reading the Acknowledgments. The author seems to allude that the \\"greatest race the world has never seen\\" was just a story, or at least an event based on third person accounts, rather than a first person account as it was written. I'm still unclear on the authenticity of the race.     Regardless, its a great book and can be appreciated by even non runners. In fact, I encourage out of shape people to read it as it may yield a new perspecitve.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|First off, THIS IS NOT A HISTORY LESSON FILM AND IT'S NOT HISTORICALLY ACCURATE.  GET OVER IT!!!!  Anyone who goes to films, fictional films as pulpy as this, looking for an education in ANYTHING, or a lesson in history is a MORON.  A simple moron who needs to read more books.  Stop with the ranting about the history.  Jeez people grow up, and don't worry about the poor simpering children.  If your kids are so stupid that they get their history from cinema then they're only slightly bigger morons then you are.  Phew....<br /><br />Tarantino, like Scorsese and Robert Altman, is one of the few directors that has never disappointed me with their varied directorial efforts.  Though Four Rooms was disappointing, but his room's story wasn't awful it just wasn't very good.  This film is not a remake of the Italian exploitation film from the 70's starring Fred Williamson either.  I guess Quentin just liked the title, but in true Tarantino genre-bending, transcendent fashion he uses a wrong spelling of the title.  Which says more about the men belonging to the group, but I am not going to say why, that's for the individual to figure out if they choose to.  This is Tarantino's Dirty Dozen, but it's really not.  It's two seperate stories set in German occupied France that have only one setting and goal in common.<br /><br />Our first, and more dramatic story line of pulp involves a hiding Jewish girl and her cinema hosting the premiere for Groebbles new propaganda film.  It's by happenstance that she gets this chance for revenge against her childhood tormentors and she cooks up a grand scheme.  This whole plot thread is so fun and ingenius.  Perfectly acted.<br /><br />The second, is of the Basterds themselves.  Basically, this team made up of American Jews and one German traitor have safely(not sure how this is possible) hidden behind enemy lines and taken out as many Germans as possible.  They've hatched a plot, with the help of the British and a German actress to take down the same movie premiere.<br /><br />Both plot lines revolve around the cinema.  Do you think it's a coincidence that Tarantino chose a cinema for his final showdown?  It's not and there's a fairly subtle message in regard to how cinema effects the truth and the dreams strewn throughout the film.  I haven't seen many Amazon reviewers address this, the most impressive and exciting part of this film.  Wonder why.  I am not going to blather on about the meanings and the points, that's for you dear viewer to get on you own...or not.  Lets just say, look at the tone shift between Shoshann's story and the Basterd's stories.  You'll notice they're not the same.  The sillier one becomes more mythic and the more realistic one becomes the stuff of myths, the stuff of films.<br /><br />Mr. Cristoph is sure fire Oscar bate this year for best supporting actor.  He plays the insidious Hans Landa AKA The Jew Hunter for the SS.  This character and performance is so good that he managed to make a glass of milk seem ominous.  The opening see when we first meet this character is perfect and brilliantly executed and performed by Cristophe and Tarantino.  We get a similar scene later on between Shoshanna and Landa over some pastries.  The tension couldn't be cut with a knife, and when the milk is ordered by Landa we in the audience start to get nervous.  Brilliant.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays the leader of the Basterds, Aldo Reigns(yes, when said fast it sounds like Aldo Ray, which I'm sure is on purpose and only means anything to real film fans).  Pitt is sublime.  He won't get the credit he deserves for this part, but he should.  He's playing the type of war movie hero that most likely never really existed outside anyone's head.  It's a broad performance and totally unscared.  He goes for every big and rediculous moment like a dog to a meaty bone.  He adds a flavor to the film that signals the tone shifts, while playing the type of good 'ol boy, ra-ra, USA, USA type of hero that the 40's propaganda would have us modern folks believe was real.  It's an Eastwood or Wayne type of character and I could see him popping up again in a different story.  We only really get to know a few of the other Basterds.  Bear Jew(Hostel I and II director Eli Roth), and Til Schweiger's one man Nazi killing machine.  Both are drawn as people through acts of violence.  We also get to meet a British spy and an undercover German actress helping to take down Hitler played by Diane Kruger.  Kruger, while lovely to look at, has not impressed me once in any of her previous roles in the National Treasure films(BLECH!) and Troy(not an awful film).  Finally, with Inglourious Basterds she proves to be more then just a pretty face.  She's really good in this film while being under scrutiny of the SS and also playing that old-school movie star.  She excels at both.  The actress who plays Shoshanna is alos quite good and thankfully very restrained, well until the end.  Her story juxtaposed with the Basterds is helped considreably by her grounded performance.<br /><br />People are already complaining that for a film called Inglourious Basterds we don't spend a lot of time or get to know those characters.  I say, YAWN!  Why are people so literal?  Is there something in the water?  \\"Gee golly, it's called 'Inglourious Basterds' so why ain't they the stars of the film?  I don't like it.  They done tricked me!\\"  Yeah, well no...idiots.  The Basterds are the mythical bigger then life characters in this film.  We CAN'T know them on a deeper level, that would take all their power away.  They're symbols of a cinematic archetype that helps Tarantino make his main thesis when compared to the Shoshanna plot thread.  Get it?  Yeah, I didn't think you did...<br /><br />I hope you like Ennio Morricone because some of his classic scores to many an Italian film makes up most of the score to this film, with some Bowie for good measure.  It's odd, with Tarantion's first three films, Resevoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, he used only source music.  With Kill Bill, Death Proof, and now this he seems to use source with older film's scores.  Though, he seems to stick with the same people like Morricone and Bernard Herman.  It's just interesting to note that he doesn't like original scores to be written for his films(unless its his pal Robert Rodriguez or The RZA for Kill Bill), but lately used the scores to other films.  I guess one does fall in love with the temp tracks.  Plus, the scores used are so obscure only real film nerds would notice they weren't new.  They fit the images so well.  \\"Gasoline on the Fire\\" by David Bowie is the first use of something modern for a film by Tarantino.  It works like gangbusters here.  It rips up the speakers as images of Shoshanna preparing for her final day and ultimate revenge play out in a fetishistic fashion with the reddest of red dressed you've ever seen on screen.  Perfection.<br /><br />I'd like to take a moment to thak Tarantino and others for saving my movie going life this summer.  It's been a rough summer filled with utter garbage(Transformers 2. G.I. Joe) and mediocrity(Terminator: Salvation, Wolverine).  The real films this year were few but worth checking out more then once.  Inglourious Basterds, District 9, Drag Me To Hell, 500 Days of Summer, and honorable mention goes to J.J. Abrams revamped alterante dimension version of Star Trek.  Everything between or after these mentioned films aren't worth shelling out the dough to see in theaters.  Maybe as rentals or perhaps on cable when you've broken your leg and its raining out.  It's sad to know that the really good films this summer aren't doing as much bussiness as the crap I mentioned.  Well, except Star Trek, but that was the only one in the list that was a sequel/remake.  Yeah, that's it!

Hmmm, maybe these REAL filmmakers should trick people into thinkingthat their films are sequels and just add numbers to the titles for no reason.  Oooh, but they would also need to be able to make action figures.  DAMN! Foiled again.<br /><br />At least we can take solace in knowing real good art will live beyond box office receipts while those who rake in the dough for a few weeks will be forgotten in the grand scheme of things.ill, Death Proof, and now this he seems to use source with older film's scores.

1400063736|5.0|The way the characters spun together was very intriguing and interesting to say the least. The book starts off with the tight rope walker in NYC, which happens to be a true a story. From there it is the stories of several different people that are involved with other groups of people and then branches off to those people's lives (sounds confusing but it's really not). This novel is heartfelt and the human emotions were very powerful to me. This is more than a novel one reads for entertainment as it dives deep into some heavy subjects and reiterates the old \\"don't judge a book by it's cover\\", everyone is unique and everyone's life is special and because of that it will not be one of those books I have read that are quickly forgotten.
B00009Z576|5.0|Musically, this is one of the best Yes albums ever.  Once you get past Trevor Horn's voice and just listen to the guitar and base this is a tremendous effort. It has a hard edge on it remenicent of Relayer.  I had left the vinyl copy of the album on the shelf for at least 10 years until I pulled it out for the first time a couple of months ago. I immediately placed an order for the CD after listening and reliving a part of my youth.  I highly recommend this one.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I mean, some of the subjects of her songs are just plain out stupid such as \\"Just Dance\\", a song about a girl who is so drunk that she's lost her keys & doesn't know why her shirt is inside out. I wouldn't normally find a song about a slobbering drunk entertaining & fun to listen to, but it is.<br /><br />Then again, Lady Gaga's not the first singer I've listened to & loved despite not agreeing with all of the subject matter. (Some of William Control's songs are actually pretty bad as well.) I just can't quite put my finger on why, but I keep moving & humming along with the songs. (Some of them I'll admit, I sing out loud- badly.) My personal favorite has to be \\"Paper Gangsta\\", a song about people who act like wanna be ganstas.<br /><br />If you like people such as Madonna, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, you'll probably love Lady Gaga. If you don't like those types of singers then the odds are that you'll despise this CD with a vengeance. (Or if you just dislike CDs that are obviously marketed & written to sell to the biggest common denominator, which this CD is. Heavy thinking isn't a part of this CD.) Either way, I'll be looking forward to Lady Gaga's next CD with great interest.

B001NB1ONC|5.0|Okay, I'm not a professional writer/reviewer, just a fan of great music.  Perhaps it's the 'tragic' element of the music, with Keith passing so soon after, but I hear a classic album that is a fitting end to the band (I know, \\"what about what came after\\", but to me, this is the end).  The first time I heard this album, about 25 years ago, I found this to be a boring, excruciating mess.  Now, after resolving to give it an open minded listen I am in awe of the band.  The songs are crisp and original to me, and perhaps because I remember little of the original mix, I find there is great clarity to the sound of the music.  This was a band who were trying to return to great form and almost did so, until Keith gave in.  'Not To Be Taken Away' indeed....  Just a suggestion to the naysayers, turn it up to about '7', find a quality pair of headphones, kick back in the recliner, turn the lights out, and just listen...

The voiceovers are perfect and the animation is flawless; the story is quite captivating, too. I was fascinated by the plot and it never bored me. The musical score enhances the film, too.<br /><br />When the film starts, we meet young Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) and her parents who are so busy writing for a gardening catalog that they have no time for Coraline. Coraline's angst is even stronger because they just moved away from their old neighborhood into a dilapidated old building called the \\"Pink Palace Apartments;\\" Coraline has no friends here. She does meet Wybie Lovat (Robert Bailey, Jr.), a quirky young boy, although they don't hit it off too well at the very start. There are the downstairs neighbors Miss April Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Miriam Forcible (Dawn French), two eccentrics who provide light comic relief from the scarier parts of the plot; and there's Mr. Sergei Alexander Bobinsky (Ian McShane), the upstairs neighbor who worked as a circus performer in his younger days. There's also the neighborhood cat who sometimes tags along after Wybie.<br /><br />Even with these new neighbors, things are pretty dull for Coraline; but things change when one day she discovers a door behind an armoire. Coraline begs her mother to open the door but they discover nothing but a wall of bricks! Coraline's mother brushes it off; but Coraline remains curious. She eventually discovers that the bricks hide a tunnel to another world just like hers--only much better. Her \\"other parents\\" are very affectionate and they anticipate Coraline's every whim; they spend time with her and she has lots of fun--there's even a circus act with Miss Spink and Miss Forcible that lets Coraline get in on the act!

0307266303|2.0|Why does McDougall unrelentingly castigate Rick Fischer? Why the gratuitous animosity? Why does he forget Jason Fagone's advice to remember the difference between story-telling and self-indulgence? His star Tarahumara runners tell him that they run \\"for their people, otherwise what's the point?\\" My wife and I, both then retired, assisted Rick put on a 50 mile race in the Copper Canyon in April, 1996. Three other gringos, benefactors from Tuscon, were there as well, along with an equal number of Mexicans. More than a dozen villages participated, more than 150 individuals, including boys and     s in shorter races. Over $10,000.00 in corn, bolts of colorful fabric, dozens of sweatshirts, and cash for winners was given out. Everyone got a prize! Compare that to the race in Born to Run where a significant number \\"cheat,\\" are disqualified, and respond with \\"we don't care, anyway.\\" Why? Because they were not running for their people, as was the case in 1996. So, RF \\"knows nothing about running,\\" his \\"junior high Spanish\\" is deplorable. But which man knows the Indians, and which is their true friend? My question is for McDougall's editor's: Where were you when McDougall needed you most? McDougall's scorn for Rick Fischer tell us nothing at all about Mr. Fischer; it adds nothing at all to his story; it tells us everything about how McDougall FEELS about Fischer. In time this lack of grace will be an embarrassment. The positive: We've really enjoyed looking at the 1996 photographs once again. And: McDougall does give good advice about feet, shoes, and diet.

We went to a high-end stereo shop and they told us that indeed this CD does sound bad. It was so bad that my wife would not enter the living room. I returned the CD, got store credit. We bought an old LP for $10 and used Audacity (a free download) to transfer it onto CD. We were immediately amazed at the difference in sound. The CD with a sharp annoying sound that you hated, opposed to the smooth listenable sounds of the vinyl. Now I'm not going to tell you to go out and sell your CDs and buy LPs. Do not. I have two other Led Zeppelin CDs and they are much better, but in this case save your money. This CD is the most horrendous sounding CD I have ever listened to. So 5 stars for the LP. Zero stars for the CD. Not all CDs sound great, and not all LPs sound like they should. No one here is trying to make a case for vinyl over CDs. They both have their distinct advantages and disadvantages. But in this case the vinyl did not even sound at all like the CD, and I have an expensive DVD player and a cheap turntable. Go figure!
B0026ICAOS|1.0|How can a horrible movie like this (and I saw it as a young horror fanatic) make it to blu-ray, and a classic like The Howling or (more importantly) The Exorcist not be out on blu-ray? We saw this as kids and made fun of it... it's so bad! Bad script, dialogue, pacing of scenes, effects... you name it.    \\"Cujo\\" was a better low budget attempt. \\"Stand By Me\\" blows them all out of the water as a King cinematic adaptation from the same time period. I will say, it's probably not as irritating as the adaptation of \\"Lawnmower Man\\" from the same book of short stories, \\"Night Shift\\" (not to be confused with the Michael Keaton Henry Winkler Shelly Long comedy).
B001OQCV2Y|4.0|There are some lengthy reviews here so I'll keep mine short. \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" is an entetaining movie. As with most Tarantino films, you'd expect some great, almost surreal visuals, too much dialouge and really not as much action as a typical action movie would contain. The dialouge is probaly the best he's done since Pulp Fiction. The humor is there, the wit and sincerity are all in place. Although most of the characters are cartoonish and sterotypical, the acting across the board is top notch. Despite many reviews calling this an ensemble piece, this is about Bradd Pitt and Christoph Waltz. It is easily Pitt's best character since Fight Club and Tarantino's best written since Jules in Pulp Fiction. Although the movie is well above average throughout, much like Pulp Fiction, I was waiting for Lt. Aldo Raine to make his next appearence. Christoph Waltz as Hans Landa is mezmorizing and the sense of forboding while he is onscreen is pallatable despite his always plesaent demenor. I will say the exchanges near the end between pro and antagonist seemed very unlikely, even in this crazy alternate history that Tarantino has created, but was satisfying none the less. I will say that some of the music, voice overs and name tags take away from the movie. This was one time where Tarantino could have let his film stand with no gimmicks and it would have been better.    Tarantino and his films are polarizing (as evidenced by trolls giving unhelpfuls to most reviews). Even his fan base is split on what his best movie is. Regardless, this fits into the Tarantino cannon. IB is not Saving Private Ryan. It's not realistic, at all. The violence IS graphic, but IS NOT action packed. There is A LOT of dialouge, and much of it is in subtitles. I enjoyed IB, but it lacks the depth and subtext of District 9 and The Hurt Locker and I would place it third this summer on my list of favorites.      As far as the Blu-Ray portion. The packaging actually gets the inferior cover (the DVD hasthe retro style ensemble). There is a digital copy, as is becoming standard. The picture quality in the open environments really pops, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's reference quality. In the grand scope, the picture quality is very good, as you would expect from most movies made in the last couple of years, but not mind blowing. The audio is also solid. As you would expect, the gunfire is almost startling and the music explodes into your speakers. The extras have as much info about the making of \\"National Pride\\" as the other extras combined, including the full length feature as directed by Eli Roth. Pretty good stuff.     I was able to purchase IB for about two dollars more than the standard DVD and would reccommend to film fans, even if you're not a Tarantino fan.
B000TGCR38|5.0|First, Black Book is rated \\"R\\" for good and several reasons. The nudity and violence is explicit followed closely by the language in spots; I would not watch this with kids, or my mother or daughters. But, that's just me. In fact, the nudity and violence is used very effectively and is integral to the telling of the story as opposed to being gratuitous.<br /><br />The movie is very, very good if you like either European WW2 stories, or studies in human nature, relationships and the grays of real life. It is also an excellent mystery. This is not a movie where the good guys overwhelmingly win; it is a movie where the good guys marginally win. It is another aspect that makes it feel real. Just like the advice in the movie, don't trust anyone!<br /><br />The language used depends on who is speaking. You will find English, Dutch and German along with English sub-titles for people like me.
1400064287|4.0|Think back to the most memorable sermon you have ever heard. Now think about what it was that made that sermon memorable. Chances are, it was an illustration. Some analogy or story gripped your attention.<br /><br />I remember attending a youth event where the preacher delivered a message about the dangers of thinking you can control your sin. The illustration he used was so powerful and vivid that fifteen years later I still remember them both - the point of the sermon and the illustration he used to make his point.<br /><br />Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die (2008, Random House) is written by brothers Chip and Dan Heath. The Heath brothers believe they know why some ideas stick and why others don't, and they are determined to help communicators figure out how to make their ideas \\"sticky.\\"<br /><br />Made to Stick is not a Christian book. Anyone entrusted with the task of communicating concepts to others can benefit from the insights here. But having read Made to Stick, I cannot help but see the practicality of these principles for preachers and teachers of God's Word.<br /><br />According to the Heath brothers, there are six principles for \\"stickiness\\" in communication:<br /><br />Simplicity<br />Unexpectedness<br />Concreteness<br />Credibility<br />Emotions<br />Stories<br />In expounding upon each of these principles, Chip and Dan provide us with a wealth of stories and examples. They show the difference between an \\"un-sticky\\" and a \\"sticky\\" idea. Most of the time, the packaging of a concept or idea is what makes it sticky, not the idea itself.<br /><br />Chip and Dan also warn against some of the dangers in communication. One villain is what they call \\"The Curse of Knowledge.\\"<br /><br />\\"This is the Curse of Knowledge. Once we know something, we find it hard to imagine what it was like not to know it. Our knowledge has `cursed' us. And it becomes difficult for us to share our knowledge with others, because we can't readily re-create our listeners' state of mind.\\" (20)<br /><br />Many pastors and teachers struggle here. We know the biblical text and the context, but many of our listeners do not. We must take great care to avoid the Curse of Knowledge as we preach, and Made to Stick helps us figure out ways to circumvent this natural tendency.<br /><br />There is much food for thought in this book:<br /><br />\\"An accurate but useless idea is still useless.\\" (57)<br /><br />\\"Common sense is the enemy of sticky messages. When messages sound like common sense, they float gently in on ear and out the other.\\" (72)<br /><br />Chip and Dan also tell stories of people who have succeeded at making sticky messages. I love the story about the Subway guy - the man who lost weight from eating sub sandwiches. This personal story helped boost Subway's sales by giving them a new advertising campaign.<br /><br />The Heath brothers believe we should be concrete and specific in our communication. Church leaders need to heed this challenge. As a discipleship pastor, I have seen mission statements that are hopelessly broad. Take this one for example: \\"We exist to make full fledged disciples of Jesus.\\" Sounds great, right?  But what does it mean? What does a full-fledged disciple of Jesus look like?<br /><br />If we are truly passionate for seeing lives changed by the power of God's Word, delivered through our sermons and teaching, then we should desire that our messages to be remembered. We want our teaching to \\"stick,\\" not because our teaching is our own, but because we are setting before our hearers the Word of God.<br /><br />If there are ways to faithfully present the truth of God's Word memorably, then we should benefit from them.

0439023483|5.0|I picked this book up on the suggestion of a friend and I cannot thank her enough! This book was absolutely stellar! There s suspense, drama, and a creatively designed dystopic world! The characters have depth and are very engaging as they race around an arena trying to kill each other!    Before getting ahead of ourselves, some back ground information is necessary. When global warming destroys the United States, the remaining land is divided up between 13 districts. When District 13 decides to fight back at the inordinate amount of control the central government is exerting, they are put down and destroyed. As a reminder of this ill-advised uprising, every year there is a nationally televised gladiator-esque game show pitting two contestants from each district against everyone else in a battle to the death.    Katniss, our 16 year-old volunteer, is a strong, determined heroine. If she can be called that. Her drive to return home forces her to be brutal and harsh, while she is still likable as a character. Her alter-ego Peeta, also from her district, is generous to a fault. The story follows them as they try to escape the other 22 players and learn of the evil that lurks in the government. Do they make it out? Read it and discover the truth!
B000RF7XYO|4.0|There is no question that Elizabeth I was the greatest Queen, and possibly the greatest monarch of either gender, that England ever had,and Cate Blanchett does an excellent job of bringing her vividly to life in Shekhar Kapur's film.  Elizabeth assumed the throne at a very young age and ruled England for over 40 years, during which time she guided her country from poverty and turmoil to peace and unpredecented power and prosperity.<br /><br />Blanchett expertly portrays Elizabeth's progress from a carefree adolescent with blooming with health and vitality, a frightened young woman expecting to be sent to the execution block at any moment by her spiteful sister Queen Mary who has been abandoned by her husband Philip of Spain and racked with pains from the cancer that is killing her, an insecure young monarch endeavoring to earn the respect of her court and her country, to a hardened woman approaching thirty, still young but no longer trusting anything but her own instincts.  Am I to be made of stone, feeling nothing? she demands after she has sent a number of traitors to the headsman.  And her answer to that question is to reinvent herself.  She will be re-virginized, married only to England and her people, devoting her life and her love to her country and her subjects.<br /><br />The film has been criticized as anti-Catholic and a good many of the villains in the movie are portrayed as Catholics trying to dethrone Elizabeth at best or kill her at worst.  It is a historical fact that the Vatican tried to destabilize her reign by declaring that no Catholic in England had to obey her or her laws and referred to Elizabeth as \\"the heretical whore\\" who had no right to occupy the throne in the first place.  Religion was the prime motivating force behind much of the conflict in 16th century England, with Mary Tudor burning Protestants at the stake and anti-Catholic regulations being promulgated after Mary's death.  There is no real anti-Catholic bias in the movie that I could find.  But the number of historical bloopers is mind-boggling, and the following are just a few of the more egregious ones:<br /><br />When Elizabeth is interrogated by a group of religious inquisitors at the beginning of the film, they claim that it was Anne Boleyn's heretical Protestantism that caused her to be executed.  Her religion had nothing to do with it.  Henry VIII had her put out of the way on a trumped-up charge of adultery and incest because he had fallen in love with another woman.<br /><br />William Cecil, portrayed as an old man in the movie, was still in his thirties at Elizabeth's accession.  He was her most trusted counselor and served her faithfully for 40 years until his death.  He was not put out to pasture as the film would have us believe.  And Francis Walsingham was not middle-aged as portrayed in the film; he was in his mid-twenties when Elizabeth became Queen.<br /><br />Lord Robert Dudley, who may or may not have been Elizabeth's lover, was a loyal friend until his death and never betrayed her in real life as he was said to have done in the film.  And as a hard-line Protestant all his life, he never converted to Catholicism.  The film shows Elizabeth as astounded and outraged when William Cecil breaks the news of Dudley's marriage.  In real life she couldn't have been all that surprised, as she attended the wedding.<br /><br />There is no evidence whatever that Walsingham was in any way involved in the death of Anne of Guise, who died only a year into Elizabeth's reign and not by poison.<br /><br />And so it goes.  The historical license may have made for more action and drama, but as history, \\"Elizabeth\\" falls way short of reality.<br /><br />The acting, however, can't be faulted on any account.  Cate Blanchett, as mentioned above, gives a knockout performance as Elizabeth, Geoffrey Rush is a compelling mixture of suavity and menace as Walsingham, Joseph Fiennes is marvelous as Robert Dudley, hopelessly in love with a woman he can never hope to have, John Gielgud and Richard Attenborough are outstanding in their respective roles as the Pope and William Cecil, and Kathy Burke is almost painful to watch as Mary Tudor, eaten up with cancer, hating and yet unable to sign the death warrant of the sister she knows will bring England back to the Protestantism she abhors and abominates.  I really wish I could give this film five stars.  But the appalling license taken with Elizabeth's life and reign forces me to withhold the last star and give it only four.<br /><br />Judy Lindstanding in their respective roles as the Pope and William Cecil, and Kathy Burke is almost painful to watch as Mary Tudor, eaten up with cancer, hating and yet unable to sign the death warrant of the sister she knows will bring England back to the Protestantism she abhors and abominates.

B001DD63UO|5.0|What can I say...It's P!nk! and its Awesome!  Seriously, Funhouse rocks!  It's Pink's usual edgey attitude mixed with her awesome vocals.  Pretty much, I don't care what she sings, because she sings it well (unlike some other girl singers who couldn't carry a tune if their life depended upon it)!  If you're a Pink fan, then you'll remain a fan after listening to Funhouse.
B002G4FQI4|4.0|George Benson is back after being off the scene for a while with his new CD \\"Songs And Stories\\". Truly a musical legend and icon with is own inimitable style, Benson has covered nearly every musical territory around including jazz, R&B, pop and back to jazz again. After nearly fifty years in the biz, he still has the vocal chops and guitar licks that made him one of the best and most beloved jazz artists ever.     Produced by John Burk and bassist Marcus Miller, \\"Songs And Stories\\" offers good music from beginning to end, with an array of talented writers and guest musicians that are almost all household names to any music fan. Benson does several remakes of classic ballads here, including \\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight\\" (James Taylor), \\"Someday We'll All Be Free\\" (Donny Hathaway), \\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\" (Brook Benton), and \\"Sailing\\" (Christopher Cross). His rendition of \\"Someday...\\" is just outstanding, both vocally and musically, with a great guitar solo.      But the highlight on this CD is \\"Living In High Definition\\", a 7-minute up-tempo instrumental perfectly suited for cruising, where Benson does his signature scatting-in-sync-with-guitar. This song is just awesome. I heard it on the radio a month prior to the CD's release and I was instantly hooked. I just had to buy this one! (Surprisingly, \\"Living In High Definition\\" was written by the legendary Motown composer Lamont Dozier).     The other highlight is \\"Exotica\\", also an instrumental where Benson cuts loose on his guitar, accompanied by Patti Austin on vocal fills. The aptly titled \\"Nuthin' But A Party\\" really funks it up with featured guest Norman Brown on guitar and of course, Marcus Miller on bass. \\"Come In From The Cold\\" has a bouncy Memphis soul feel to it, complete with that \\"Al Green-style\\" Hammond B3 organ arrangement. The downside to the CD is the bluesy yet uninspiring \\"A Telephone Call Away\\", featuring Lalah Hathaway. But overall, \\"Songs And Stories\\" is a very nice CD, with outstanding vocalsand superb musicianship. This one should definitely be added to your George Benson collection.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I was looking for an efficient workout- maximum results in minimum time, and I have it!! I'm not looking for motivational music and frills, but a serious workout, which this is. I've done it for 4 days straight, taking a break on the 5th, and hope to do it 5-6 days each week. I always use a trampoline to do the cardio moves- jumping jacks on my floor would kill my knees and would kill the poor people who live in the apartment below mine! :) I am enjoying this- my arms especially are really really sore with the 5lb weights and pushups (am still on my knees), and the butt is worked well by the lunges. Am so enjoying my Day 5 of rest. But I don't feel it in my abs much afterward. Will do Level 1 till I feel ready for Level 2. And I love Jillian and her technique!!! Am also reading her book \\"Master Your Hormones\\" and it makes sooo much sense to me.

B000MXPE7O|3.0|Beautifully lit and shot (the movie looks like \\"The Godfather, Part II\\"), \\"The Good Shepherd\\" is nevertheless long, mostly dull, and muddled in its message.  Is the film saying that Matt Damon's character honored his beliefs and ideals during his CIA career, compromised them, or a combination of both?  It just wasn't clear how he felt about things, or even (equally unhelpful) how complicit he was in certain activities.  And while I don't begrudge Angelina Jolie playing the occasional unglamorous role, her shrill wife character seemed a waste of her talents.  \\"The Good Shepherd\\" gets a few points for looking good, a handful of tense scenes, and some good supporting performances (including one by director Robert De Niro), but overall it was a disappointment.  The DVD looks and sounds great, and features a selection of deleted scenes (revealing an entire excised subplot about the Angelina Jolie character's brother) as its sole special feature.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|Why? Because I watched the entire first season over the computer, and noticed that the quality was actually far better than some other shows I've seen online. Add that into the fact that the first season was amazing, and I will back my 5-star recommendation. Yes, it's a bit like the X-Files, and I love the X-Files, but it's been gone so long that fans should be welcoming to this type of show. I notice that people are giving it 1 star because they're mad about Sarah Connor, or mad about subtitles, but that should maybe take one star away from the review. This is a fantastic show, great cast, great theme song and credits, and great twists. I'm sure the quality will be great as well. Highly recommended.    Oh, and PS - Walter actually does make you crave for the same snacks once he says it.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First of all - let me start off by saying that I am 33 years old & weigh 186 lbs.  I am trying to get back down to the weight I was before I had my baby 14 months ago.  I have been working out doing circuit training 3 times a week 30 minutes each time for the past 4 months & have lost a total of 12 lbs so far.  I know an hour & a half of exercise each week is not enough to get maximum results so I wanted a workout DVD I could do quickly in the mornings before I go to work. I honestly thought I could handle a simple 20 minute Level 1 workout but I was wrong!!! I just did my first workout yesterday & my thighs are so sore today - I can hardly get up or sit down right now much less think about walking down stairs.  This DVD definitely works as I can feel it today.  I can even tell my abs got a workout too.  Jillian really pushes you to keep going through the 20 minutes of workout.  I honestly feel like I got more of a workout with this 20 minutes than I have any day with my circuit workouts.  I unfortunately have to wait a day or two for my thighs to quit screaming before I can work out with this DVD again.  My only problem with this DVD is that Jillian expects you to just be able to drop down & start doing pushups (of course the 3 of them in the video all a size 2 have no problems with this).  I on the other hand was able to do about 5 push ups before I dropped to the floor.  If this happens to you - pick yourself up & move on with them to the next exercise.  You will enjoy the workout - it goes by quick.  I hope to work out with Jillian again tomorrow morning.

B002DKF47O|5.0|I got this CD right after seeing Behemoth absolutely kill at Mayhem Fest '09, they played a set in the middle of a summer afternoon in South Texas, and they just crushed, so naturally I had to get this CD.  Their set was one of the highlights of Mayhem Fest, and there was some tough competition: White Chapel, God Forbid, Job for a Cowboy, Black Dahlia Murder, All That Remains, Trivium, Cannibal Corpse, Bullet for my Valentine, Killswitch Engage and Slayer (I won't count M. Manson, how did he end up on that bill?!), and Behemoth easily was one of the most exciting and talented bands there.  Demigod sets the bar high, a standard that The Apostacy didn't quite match, but this album matches Demigod in the catchiness of the riffs, the interesting and different sounding songs (we've all heard the albums where all the songs sound the same, right? but Behemoth crafts music that sounds different.)  Nergal is a superstar in the making, in my opinion, he's at the top of his game right now, check this one out, then compare this album with Demigod; no matter which one you think is better, you will have treated yourself to some brutal good times.

1567184855|4.0|This is may be the most secret truth of all. Sadly, hardly anybody care to look. However, I can not help myself wondering what language soul speak to each other. Because from what i've read in this great book, nobody has ever mentioned anything about language they speak at all but only how they look like as souls. Which i find pretty odd.     Language is every important and should be the few first questions anybody would ask a soul.  If i was born here in Thailand does it mean, i have to be born here forever? Because i have read so many books from Thai monks who can do what Newton can, and when they look into people's pasts, they always find these Thai people were born as Thai people many many times before and none of them found born in any foreigner countries at all, which i find hard to believe. I would hate to be born to the same country over and over again forever. I know Newton's mentions soul being born other planets and countries but he never asked his patient about what language speak. Why? I have no idea. It's the only one missing puzzle that i need to know. It drives me crazy.    Does the love for our native country mean anything at all in the spirit world? Because 80% of world population make such a big deal out of what country they are from. Does spirit world care about country on this earth? Sorry for my english though. I am a Thai native speaker.  I hope Newton's next book would mention about language or anybody here could shade some light for me, i would appreciate it very much.

Even though some of the \\"songs\\" are catchy, they are unoriginal and uninspired.  The beats are weak and his vocals are just overdubbed and washed out.  The best part of this CD is when you hear Cornell actually sing if you listen to all the minutes of the last song.  I am not sure what he was thinking here?  Stick with what you know, and you know how to rock!<br /><br />UPDATE!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />DARN IT....I hated this at first, but it grows on you and if you dont think of it as Cornell, its pretty good!  The songs stick in my head and whenever someone is in my car they ask who it is......argghhh..I retract my first review.  This is a great and addictively unique album!
B000022TSH|5.0|The \\"Chinatown\\" DVD was an item that we had shopped for and found through Amazon.  DeeVeeDees offered this brand-new product at a very low price.  The item was carefully packaged and shipped as well.  We certainly recommend this seller!

B0028K31CE|2.0|It's great to see & hear that Maxwell is back with a new project. He has been greatly missed. First the positives: of this CD. It good to hear that he hasn't followed what now passes as R&B/Soul in this musical sphere, as if this project was recorded in isolation. Also I like the fact that there aren't numerous guest appearances, or too many songs on offer. It's nine songs under 40 minutes, so it's lean & mean. What of the songs themselves. Unfortunately, to my ears, there is too much of sameness on offer here. Whilst nothing is truly awful, there are only three tunes to my ears that stand out. The Opening track 'Bad Habits' is a gorgeous track, reminiscence of his first CD, and is a pleading track seeking forgiveness. The following track `Cold' whilst not as striking as it's predecessor, grows on you the more you listen to it. Lastly the quiet stormish, acoustic driven `Playing Possum' is simply beautiful.I almost forgot the last track on offer here, `Phoenix Rise', which is a great driven funky instrumental.<br /><br />2.5 out of five
B001XJEKGC|4.0|The video is EC and SW centric. The rest of the musicians are not even shown. All angles on just these 2 legends. Video a dissapointment. Music is good. Rather vintage stuff but with the kind of sound and recording equipment available today, we get to listin to great sound.
0765356139|5.0|Ouch - that hurt. Finishing this book was like taking a knife wound. I didn't want it to end there. But the good news for me is that Book 3 is out. In fact, I already read the prologue...<br /><br />Anyway, back to Book 2. I didn't like it quite as much as Mistborn: The Final Empire, but still liked it enough for 5 stars. This book simply rocks!<br /><br />The pace is somewhat slow, but that's necessary for the character building and development that Sanderson is accomplishing. But then when the action kicks in, it's like watching X-Men.<br /><br />This wasn't a caper saga like the first book, but rather a world-building exercise where Sanderson moves the players on his gameboard around. There are new characters and old alike, new mysteries and old ones seen in a new light. New revelations and surprises abound.<br /><br />Because this book is the bridge of the trilogy, I like to think of The Well of Ascension as:<br /><br />The Final Empire Strikes Back
B000J103WK|3.0|Great video quality. Sound I would rate a 3 star. I am just not happy with the sound quality. They have paid so much attention to video and they have not taken the same kind of care with the sound.
0547258305|1.0|Graceling is like a movie you keep watching because you think it has to get better, but it never does and you regret it by the end. The idea could have really been something but it never amounted to the potential. The book starts out interesting with these mysterious gracelings who have gifts to do things very well, then dips into predictable or shallow characters, an upsetting animal torturing king, bloody hunting, traveling more then needed, unrealistic conclusions, and unimportant realizations that have been mentioned before. Things don't add up in this book and major details overlooked while minor detailed are focused on to annoyance. I read a lot and was awfully disappointed in this book. I don't recommend reading it.
B00004SAJK|4.0|Much of the Paul Chapman era of UFO has been unfairly maligned and the albums of that era have languished in some form of critical obscurity. However these records should not be an overlooked part of the catalog as they include some of the band's tightest collection of songs and outstanding productions. `Mechanix' is a fine record, released in early 1982 and the last to feature founding member Pete Way (until subsequent later reformations). While maybe not on par with `No Place to Run' or `WWI', `Mechanix' boasts a loud, modern sound and a decent mix of rockers and some slower numbers. \\"The Writer\\" kicks off the LP in fine fashion, being a classic UFO rocker. Other faves include \\"Doing It All for You\\", \\"Feel It\\" and single \\"Let It Rain\\". \\"Back Into My Life\\" was also a single as well and could be criticized for being an intentional hit but it is still a very good song.  Supposedly it was these concessions to the top 40 that drove Way from the band but a may have been that the runaway substance abuse/internal squabbles clichés may have been more of a deciding factor.  Within a few years Phil Mogg would be the only remaining member and the band would become a joke but in the meantime they had a least one more quality record in them before the eighties swallowed them up.
B001SMC91M|4.0|Great album and lots of fun -- fits nicely into the neo-soul/ Motown revival movement that has become marginally popular of late.  If you like Eli \\"Paperboy\\" Reed or the Dynamites or Sharon Jones and the Dap Kings, you'll probably also like Black Joe Lewis and the Honeybears.  This one brings a bit more of a blues influence than those similar artists, however.  All in all, I definitely recommend it!

B000BCE918|3.0|You can't argue with a package of three top-notch action films for $14, but they have engaged in some very aggressive cost cutting measures in order to achieve this price point.    First of all, the swinging doors are no longer. All you get now is a photograph of the swinging doors! First cool feature to go.     Second, you don't get printed graphics on the disks. You simply get the titles of three films in black lettering. Very low budget.    Finally, they've not done anything to improve the image quality of these dvd's.     This package is not a rip-off, but it's not a fun repackaging either. If you simply want the original three films with little or no frills at a bargain basement price, this product will make you happy.

1439138311|5.0|Brooklyn follows a young woman named Eilis as she travels from her Irish home town to New York in the early 1950s. Almost without asking, her family decides that she should move to America because she is more likely to find a good job there. Eilis struggles to adjust at first, but eventually finds her way and settles down beginning a romance with an Italian-American named Tony. Eilis brushes against social issues such as the Italian neighbourhoods versus the Irish neighbourhoods in NYC, the gradual integration of African Americans into white society, her female supervisor's latent lesbianism and her Jewish night school teacher who escaped the WWII concentration camps. But she never experiences any great conflict with these issues. Toibin manages to do something very special in this humble, quiet novel. There isn't a great deal of action. The language the author uses is engaging but simple. The characters are interesting but not extraordinary. What the author does is immerse you totally in Eilis' daily life and the small but important decisions she makes along the way which lead up to a devastatingly brilliant ending where the protagonist must make a serious heartrending choice. The lead up to this final section is very subtle so it took me by surprise and completely engrossed me.<br /><br />What Toibin does so well is describe Eilis' relationships with those closest to her. He conveys how deep bonds can exist between family members even if nothing is said. The love and responsibility these characters feel for each other is expressed through small actions like writing each other letters about superficial things or sorting through old clothes together. He approaches scenes filled with a tremendous emotional intensity with a very light touch so that you almost don't realist the importance of what's happening until it's over. This is when Eilis' superficially simple life takes on a magnitude of importance.
0060922583|5.0|The late Michael Talbot was fascinated by the findings in 1982 at the University of Paris that \\"under certain circumstances subatomic particles such as electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other regardless of the distance separating them. It doesn't matter whether they are 10 feet or 10 billion miles apart.\\"<br /><br />David Bohm, a brilliant physicist, flew in the face of conventional science by suggesting that reality might be more than the material or \\"explicate order\\" extending to other realms that he called the \\"implicate order.\\" Karl Pribram, a neurophysiologist, hypothesized that in the brain, \\"memories are encoded not in neurons, or small groupings of neurons, but in patterns of nerve impulses that crisscross the entire brain in the same way that patterns of laser light interference crisscross the entire area of a piece of film containing a holographic image. In other words, Pribram believes the brain is itself a hologram.\\" Talbot combines the ideas of Bohm and Pribram (both of whom are credited in the book as having been \\"generous with both their time and their ideas) to show how the entire universe could be a hologram, or more correctly, multiple holograms, arising out of consciousness. He delves into neuroscience, citing the fact that responses are initiated in the body before the sensory perception that triggered them has been consciously processed as indicating that (1) the brain may be filtering and altering the inputs and (2) our subconscious may be taking decisions for us.<br /><br />Talbot effectively shows how such a holographic universe could explain, not only phenomena from the quantum world, but also spirituality and many paranormal phenomena including: near-death experiences (NDE); out-of-body experiences (OBE); miracles; clairvoyance; psychokinesis; and so on. The many examples of such phenomena that Talbot cites are fascinating in themselves, but it is the way in which they can be reconciled with the Bohm-Primram idea that really sets the book apart. Of course, when anyone ventures to give examples of paranormal phenomena, someone will point to the fact that a particular one has subsequently been shown to be in doubt - especially as here where almost 20 years have elapsed since the book was written. The more remarkable thing is that despite that lapse of time, most of the examples quoted by Talbot remain unexplained by natural causes.<br /><br />Science typically does not take an interest in the paranormal, which is resistant to the scientific method of repeated experimentation to provide physical evidence. But as Talbot accurately states: \\"when vast numbers of people start reporting the same experiences, their anecdotal accounts should also be viewed as important evidence. They should not be dismissed merely because they cannot be documented as rigorously as other and often less significant features of the same phenomenon can be documented ... science must replace its enamorment with objectivity - the idea that the best way to study nature is to be detached, analytical, and dispassionately objective - with a more participatory approach.\\" I would only take exception here to the word \\"replace\\" and say that science can continue perfectly well in its own milieu provided that we also investigate the rest of reality. This is an important book; an excellent read but also food for thought. I'd also recommend books by Irvin Laszlo to anyone who finds this one as fascinating as I did.the book apart.

B001GCUO16|1.0|Ok so if the CGI sucked when you saw it in theaters it is going to suck when you watch it in the privacy of your living room. This is the best example of when Hollywood totally ruins a great concept. They did it with Spider Man, Star Wars, & X-Men Last Stand. Soon to follow looks to be Iron Man.     This crap of a movie was a joke. I have seen better CGI from Clash of the Titans. I love how his claws floated with the worst angles after he escaped to the farm house and they had that horrible bathroom scene. By far Liev Schreiber stole the show, his role as Sabretooth is the only redeeming quality in this film. Oh yeah Sabretooth couldn't get metal claws either. Also did I mention that Ryan Reynolds is a tool and they TOTALLY ruined Deadpool and I am going to kick whoever makes a Deadpool movie in the crotch for yet again ruining a great concept. One star for Liev if not I wouldn't have even bothered putting a star.

0061438294|5.0|This book does a very good job of helping you understand body language.  It blends the theory behind body language with numerous pictures and practical explanations for observing and interpreting people's non-verbal behavior.  The author brings in a lot of his own personal experience to add more than a dash of authenticity to this book.  As a young trial lawyer I have found this book helpful in both dealing with general courtroom personnel as well as picking juries.  Highly recommended.

B0029NY9YO|4.0|I bought this version after watching the extended version and not being overly impressed with the additional content.  I liked the flow of the Theatrical Cut better and figured that I would not miss the added scenes.  What I did miss was director commentary.  There is none on this version only on the extended cut.  I found this really annoying and hope the huge box set coming out this winter will fix it.
B000001FDK|3.0|The movie was terrific, but I only found some of the music worth ripping. I generally prefer original hits by original artists.  I wasn't that impressed with Sha-Na-Na's renditions of past hits.    My first interest was for danceable numbers.  Movie soundtracks can have tempo changes and undanceable introductions and endings, but those sections can be removed after ripping.    I found a couple reproduction glitches.  There is a tic (like a record scratch) in \\"Mooning\\", and \\"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing\\" cuts off too soon.    The nine tunes I ripped were: Grease; Summer Nights; Hopelessly Devoted to You; You're the One that I Want; Beauty School Dropout; Greased Lightnin'; Blue Moon (because it's a slow version); Mooning; and We Go Together.    FYI, I'm a record collector of 55 years and a sometimes deejay.

B0029LHW4A|5.0|JET fans get ready for a long awaited injection of upbeat rock and roll. The new album Shaka Rock out August 25th is sure to be a summer highlight with strong infectious beat and catchy lyrics. The songs resonate optimism, shedding off the weight of the world to come alive with electric energy. The boys haven't forgotten how to have fun. Throw in a bit of classic rock, punk attitude, and straight forward rock and roll and what you get is the distinctive sound of JET.      Beat on Repeat's temperate vocals are backed by a solid beat full of \\"Yah Yah's.\\"  Akin to the feel of Beat on Repeat is Times Like This with great lyrics like \\"we feel the way we want to feel\\" and \\"everyone the same when they hit the floor\\" giving the song an upbeat message. Both make you want to jump up and dance, leaving you wanting more. La Di Da is sure to be a hit with fans and encompasses a pure JET atmosphere. Walk has the \\"wherewithal\\" to push you forward on a powerful wave of massive guitar and heavy drums.     Having heard Seventeen and Goodbye Hollywood live at the Key Club in Los Angeles along with She's a genius and K.I.A. JET has developed Shaka Rock into a modern classic with high energy and a progressive flair.

0061537969|5.0|At first glance, you may think the book is about what dogs really think; however, that is just peripheral to the main idea of the story.  The author used so many brilliant writing techniques to make his point.   The title is a metaphor for how one should live his or her life and it is explained multiple times.    Although most of the book is about a child custody battle, it goes so much deeper than that.  I felt very inspired and couldn't put the book down.  It was a truly compassionate work of art and I hope the author writes more books.
1594488916|5.0|Despite its title, \\"The Man Who Loved Books Too Much\\" is not a book about some especially avid reader who becomes so obsessed with reading that he allows it to take over the rest of his life.  One only has to read the book's subtitle, \\"The True Story of a Thief, a Detective, and a World of Literary Obsession,\\" to learn that \\"the man\\" in question had a much different problem.<br /><br />That John Gilkey is an obsessed book collector is beyond question.  Gilkey's gnawing desire to own rare books, however, does not make him unique - or even uncommon.  People collect a variety of objects for a variety of reasons and many of them do become obsessed with the chase and the displaying of their \\"trophies.\\"  What makes Gilkey unusual enough to have a book written about him is that he entirely satisfies his urge to own rare books by stealing them.  Price is no object for a man who never intends to pay for the books he adds to his personal library.<br /><br />\\"In The Man Who Loved Books Too Much,\\" Allison Hoover Bartlett combines Gilkey's story with that of the man who became obsessed with stopping his thefts, rare book dealer Ken Sanders.  Against all odds, she was able to befriend both men to such a degree that she was able to gain insight into what motivated each of them - one to steal books and the other to spend countless hours trying to stop him.<br /><br />Bartlett spent a great deal of time getting to know John Gilkey.  She visited him in jail when he was serving time for stealing expensive items from rare book dealers; she interviewed him extensively while he was a free man; and she visited his mother's home where she was allowed to see some of the books being kept for him there.  However, as Ken Sanders, the man most responsible for putting Gilkey behind bars for extended periods of time reminded Bartlett, Gilkey is a born liar and what he says can never be trusted.  Bartlett, though, despite Gilkey's lies and distortions, develops a sound theory as to why he is so driven to steal rare books despite the increasing regularity with which he is caught and sent to jail.<br /><br />Book dealer/detective Ken Sanders seems to have been more of a challenge for Bartlett than Gilkey turned out to be.  Sanders seemed reluctant to discuss in any detail what motivated him to dedicate so much of his life to Gilkey's capture and arrest.  He preferred, instead, to let his actions speak for themselves.  Sanders did open the door to the world of rare book dealers for Bartlett by placing her in contact with many of Gilkey's victims, and she combines the insights she gained from those interviews with her own research to recount the history of book lust and book theft from the earliest days to the present.<br /><br />This is the perfect true crime book for book lovers, a morality play to remind even the most obsessed of us of the dangers of those obsessions.<br /><br />Rated at: 4.5ks despite the increasing regularity with which he is caught and sent to jail.

After leaving fellow Trip-Hop group Massive Attack, Tricky brings us his debut solo album with dark, rich, layered beats, and sound landscapes accompanied by the beautiful voice of former partner-in-crime, and mother of his child, Martina Topley-Bird.  Voted album of the year by NME Magazine this this is the quintessential album of the genre.  If I were stranded on a island, and could only have 6 CD's with me, this would be one of them.  It is really THAT good, from the first to the last track.

B002DESIE6|5.0|The xx have been all over blogs for a while now, and I first caught a track from them when their demos were leaked online.  It was \\"Crystalised\\" and I was totally in love.  When XX was released last week, I immediately bought it, and it has been playing through my headphones and speakers ever since.    The opening track, \\"Intro,\\" is amazing on its own.  Instrumental, if you consider their vocalization (without lyrics) an instrument.  It sets the tone for the entire album, withe a chill yet building sound, and an ever thumping bass. The music seems simple, but fresh.  There are moments in the album where the repeated echoing notes remind me of early Interpol and some of the riffs harken late 80s new wave, but I have a hard time drawing real parallels to other bands. Some of the lyrics make me nostalgic for a modern/retro 90s life I've never had (\\"watch things on vcrs, with me &talk about Big Love\\"), and the almost-fuzzy, understated-but-prominent male and female vocals, which both compete & come in as a chorus, remind me of some lazy love affair. Actually, the entire album seems to be an ode to this lazy love affair.    This really is my favorite debut of 2009.  Incredibly impressive and something you want to get your hands on, I promise. Here's the tracklist, since amazon.com doesn't have one up yet:    01. Intro  02. Vcr  03. Crystalised  04. Islands  05. Heart Skipped A Beat  06. Fantasy  07. Shelter  08. Basic Space  09.

B000EXZI0A|5.0|With this CD, you have all of the Ramones' best songs (Beat on the brat, Blitzkrieg bop, I wannna be sedated) in one place. The band combined a raw punk rock sound with their own brand of energy and enthusiasm. The lyrics are original often cynical (see Judy is a punk and Beat on the brat.) While listening to this album, I realized what a great bassist the late Dee Dee Ramone was (R.I.P. man.)  This compliation also has the hit ''Pet Sematary'' that was written for the Stephen King movie and wasn't included on any of their studio albums.  So what are you waiting for? Buy it already!

His use of effects such as wah-wah, bending and feedback was groundbreaking to say the least. Hendrix mixed rock, blues and psychedelic together to create something truly great. With this compliation, you get some of his best and most famous songs, including ''Purple Haze'' ''Voodoo Child'' and ''Along the Watchtower,'' all of them featuring great riffs and solos from the Godfather of guitar.  Needless to say, Jimi was the star of the Hendrix Experience, but the bassists (Billy Cox and Noel Redding) and drummer (Mitch Mitchell) were outstanding too. I think there is nothing controversial in calling The Hendrix Experience one of the best bands of all time.  'Peace 'n love everyone  Falkor

Her first was bubble gum pop and too corny as it's best even though this album was like that too, but the songs on here are MUCH stronger. The third one was just inconsistent, had more annoying songs, and had really bad covers like I Love Rock N Roll. Talking about this album does give me good memories of 2000 when britney was at her peak. 2000 had a alot of catchy, memorable songs....Bye Bye Bye, the Real Slim Shady, etc.<br /><br />1.

B0029LHW4A|1.0|these guys were, but no more, thee best vintage rockers on the planet with \\"get born\\" and \\"shine on\\". if you loved jet for their take on exile-era stones, badfinger, abbey-road beatles and oasis with a vintage sex, drugs and rock & roll attitude, and swagger, forget about this new release because it blows. shaka rock is lightweight \\"trying-too-hard-to-be-current\\" crap.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|Arctic Monkeys blew onto the scene, seemingly out of nowhere, in 2006 with their debut album \\"Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not\\", becoming the fastest-selling debut in UK history (and ultimately also selling quite well in the US). It was a good album, for sure, but overrated in my opinion. The band quickly released a follow-up album, 2007's \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\", which I thought was absolutely fantastic (I had it in my Top 3 of the year), even though it was less commercially successful than the first album, both in the UK and here in the US. (The closing track \\"505\\" will give you an idea of the new album, incidentally.) The band toured relentlessly and then took its merry time to come back with new material. Now finally comes the hugely anticipated third album. I must admit that I was skeptical when I heard that Josh Homme, Queens of the Stone Age frontman, produced most of the album (I am not a Queens of the Stone Age fan).<br /><br />It is immediately clear that \\"Humbug\\" (10 tracks; 39 min.) is quite the departure from the previous two albums. much darker and more subdued. The album stumbles out of the blocks with a tentative \\"My Propeller\\", the weakest track on here, and I generally skip it to be honest. But things perk up after that with \\"Crying Lightning\\" (1st UK single), possibly the best song on here, and most reminiscent of the earlier albums. \\"Dangerous Animals\\" is quite nice as well, which is followed by a nice ballad \\"Secret Parade\\". The middle section of the album brings mostly slower, subdued songs. The band really finds its groove on this album towards the latter part, starting with \\"Dance Little Liar\\", setting off a tense and great ending of the album. \\"Pretty Visitors\\" is one of the best tracks on here, and the 5+ min. closer \\"The Jeweller's Hands\\" caps off the album nicely.<br /><br />If you are looking for a repeat of the first 2 albums, you will be sorely disappointed. This album is dense but it started to win me over after repeated listening. Arctic Monkeys have moved on, period. Deal with it. I find the comparison with Kings of Leon very telling. After KoL's first two \\"Southern Strokes\\" albums, that band came back with an equally darker 3rd album \\"Because of the Times\\", telling us the band was going different places (and we now know to what that has lead, with their \\"Only By the Night\\" mega-smash album). Having seen Arctic Monkeys in concert a number of times, I also imagine that a number of these seemingly subdued songs will rock hard in concert. The band is visiting Ohio next month, can't wait for that.. Arctic Monkeys have moved on, period. Deal with it. I find the comparison with Kings of Leon very telling.

0307269752|1.0|The book's original Swedish title was \\"Men Who Hate Women,\\" which is a pretty good summary of the book. The novel offers a thoroughly ugly view of human nature in which sadism, murder and suicide are commonplace.<br /><br />Early on and through out the book there were too many details that really were not all that interesting and did not further the story. 600+ pages and I was hoping at some point this book would redeem itself, but it never did.<br /><br />I did also view a few movie clips for 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' on youtube, which seemed a huge improvement over the book. So given the opportunity, go see the movie and save the additional 4-8 hours of your life for something much more enjoyable!

B000002L9Y|5.0|yes my friends, this band has done it again. any doubt that this band lost it after tusk will be comforted after one listen of little lies. or seven wonders. the album is total cheesy 80's pop....it sounds very dated and hasnt aged as well as some of their other releases. but its still the same magic. my lord...only fleetwood mac could produce a song like everywhere. yes, some of stevies contributions are blah. much has been said about welcome to the room sara and when i see you again...and to be honest these tracks are perfectly acceptable as filler. but stevie nicks kills it on seven wonders. this album seems to me, most of all like a lindsay buckingham solo album, except listenable and actually good. sorry lindsay. its not rockabilly or summery rock, but more 80's synth pop.    a weird, dated, awkward, totally sappy and corny album but its very wonderful nonetheless and stands strong alongside rumors and tusk.
0307266303|5.0|As a life-long runner and exercise advocate, I found Born to Run both entertaining and enlightening.  At times I couldn't wait to return to read the next chapter.  In 1985 I spent two months in Creel, a town in the Sierra Tarahumara of the Mexican state of Chihuahua studying the Tarahumaras and their day-to-day physical activity.  Some of Born to Run takes place in and around Creel.  I'd heard the ledgends of Tarahumara long-distance running, but when visiting Tarahumara territory, I saw little evidence of them running.  Most impressive was the difficult terrain in which they subsist.  If you have any interest in ultra-long-distances you will be fascinated by learning about various ultramarathoners, and the Tarahumaras' running.  What kind of person runs ultramarathons?  Why did we evolve to be able to run long distances?  What ever happened to the Taramahumaras who won ultramarathons in the past?  Why do they run so far?  How do Tarahumaras train?  What kind of shoes do they wear?  What kind of shoes should we wear?  These and other questions are explored in McDougall's entertaining way.  McDougall is clearly oriented to very-long-distance running (ultramarathons) and makes shorter activities like sprinting seem less worthwhile.  His views are not necessarily supported by data, but then the same could be said about our knowledge of running in general - much of what we believe is guided by anecdote and fashion.

B001NLKT60|5.0|Following the successful introduction to Lisbeth Salander in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Stieg Larsson unfolds her traumatic early life to help us understand who she has become today. When that past becomes perilously mixed up with her present, Larsson gives us a mystery story which had me reading late into the night anxious to get to the next twist. A very good book, well written (congratulations to the translator for the excellent English), and guaranteed to have you wanting more at the end. I can't wait for the third and last installment from the late author.
0316017922|5.0|This is my first \\"book report\\" and the standard spoiler alert is in full effect. I recently read Maclom Gladwell's book Outliers and wanted to talk about it. To start, it was a great book. For those of you that are not familiar with the writings of Malcom Gladwell, he has written two other books of note; The Tipping Point and Blink, which I highly recommend. Gladwell has a way of explaining concepts through story telling and Outliers is no exception.<br /><br />The focus of this book is what makes people successful. The general assumption is that people succeed due to their innate ability. Gladwell dispels this myth through such concepts as the 10,000 hour rule, the general lack of geniuses ruling the world, the role of legacy and sharing people's stories and their fortuitous timing. (The 10,000 hour rule states that a person has to work at something for 10,000 hours to master it.)<br /><br />Gladwell's recipe for success (and I'm paraphrasing here) is a combination of:<br /><br />  1. Passion (for some-thing)<br />  2. Hard work<br />  3. and excellent timing.<br /><br />Intelligence plays a part and yet it's not the key factor as there are many people with extremely high IQs  (200!?!?!!) that are not raging success stories. Malcom also discusses creative intelligence, but does not dive very deep.<br /><br />In the end he concludes that there are no outliers:<br /><br />  They are products of history and community, of opportunity and legacy. Their success is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, some just plain lucky - but all critical to making them who they are. The outlier, in the end, is not an outlier at all.<br /><br />As I read this book and all of the circumstances around being successful, the analogy that came to mind is surfing. For those of you that surf (or have tried surfing) you understand what it is to be a grommit; a beginner. You quickly realize that surfing is an amazing skill to attain. (You notice I did not say master since you never really master surfing.) Learning to surf is a humbling experience and I would not be surprised if Kelly Slater fits the 10,000 hour rule.<br /><br />Surfing is a combination of different skills.<br /><br />  1. You have to be able to \\"read the swells\\" to tell where the next set will come in<br />  2. You need to be able to tell where the wave will break relative to the shore<br />  3. You need to be able to position your self in the right spot relative to where the wave is breaking; not to far out and not to close to the shore<br />  4. and until you attain the skill, you need be strong enough to compensate for not having that skill fully defined<br /><br />Surfing, like Gladwell's examples of successful people, is a combination of having the skill to read the landscape (seascape), being in the right place at the right time (good fortune), having the capability to execute, having spent the time practicing and having the passion to be ride the wave.since you never really master surfing.)

B000R7HY0K|5.0|I recently watched this film and it has left me with such regret I didn't follow my gut and go see it at the movies.  Since \\"Kill Bill\\" I fell in love with QT and his style of film making, and that alone would have convinced me to sit for 3 hours to watch this. I had no idea what exploitation films were or are and that's what I love about QT.  He uses elements in his films that show people like me who are not movie buffs other styles of filmmaking and movies. Therefore, You admire a new branch of films and filmmaking you didn't know was out there. Everything was in this movie great dialogue, music, suspense, actors and there is very little I didn't enjoy.  I knew all the long conversation would lead up to something I wasn't expecting and boy was I right.  The car chase in the second half was also exciting and it has a very different turn out from the first half (it seems Mike is more a pussy cat than a lion as he portrayed previously)  I learned a lesson from this to always follow my instinct regarding what films I choose to watch.  The media is so obsessed with Jennifer Aniston, JLo, Britney crap that, that is all they talk about.  There was no buzz over this film and thus my interest went from 10 to 0.  I'm sure Britney was drunk driving again when this came out so the focus was on her, or maybe Jennifer Aniston was getting dumped again for the 100th time. All I have to say is watch this with an open mind because it is a very interesting and entertaining film.  The fact that I'm still thinking about the film 2 days later and looking info about it online says a lot.      PS Regarding the fake trailer you can Youtube them, I did and like everyone said over the top campy and funny.   PPS Planet Terror is next and I can't wait.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Thank you for your quick attention to this order. It arrived quicker than expected and was very happily received.
B000TXG3YA|5.0|This album is HEAVY, DENSE and PROFOUND, yet still has the light, airy and calming passages of its less \\"metal\\" prog/rock predecessors.  I have only begun to listen to \\"metal\\" in the last year or so and was mainly a fan of older music and had given up (quite literally) on finding any REAL new music.  I must say that coming from a place where Rush is my favorite band and Mastodon was the first metal group I really got into, Baroness is an almost terrible band to jump to....because every band discovered after them simply can't stack up.  This album is timeless.  The guitars are heavy (almost bludgeoning in sound) due in part to Baroness' use of C standard+Drop D tuning(!) [lowwwww]yet accessible due to their melody.  Time signatures change much as they do in Rush songs (i.e. they suit the song and don't just sound like The Musical Olympics...I'm looking at you John Petrucci) and there are nice clean-toned sections as well (it takes about 2-3 minutes for Rays on Pinion to get heavy; Cockroach En Fleur is acoustic; Wailing Wintry Wind is a beautiful song with ridiculously clever arpeggios and harmonies).  Between sweet sparkling clean tones, thundering drop-tuned riffs, dynamic guitar harmonies and rhythmic changes akin to Rush and Yes, this album starts and doesn't let up until the seemingly out-of-place country twang that is the 'Hidden Track' at the very end of the album (11 min. or so into the last track).  Fans of prog, metal, and fundamentally good guitar music will listen to this front to back...no fast forwarding or track skipping necessary.  Bands leading the way for a \\"new\\", more cerebral, less pretentious metal/prog scene include Mastodon, Baroness, Kylesa, Isis, High on Fire, Torche, Intronaut and the many more that have revived my faith in 21st century music.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|After the 3rd attempt at trying to watched this movie I finally didn't fall alseep and watched the complete movie, now I wished I did fall asleep like the first two times. What a waste of time. How the hell did the Joker planned all these plots, plans, bombs, killings while Batman compliants that he can't find him. This movie is a \\"joke\\". And the joke is on us.  This is a mindless piece of junk that  you have to suspend all intelligence and logic to actually endured it. I was so bore then so angry that i just had to write this review to blow off some steam.  Batman Begins was great, It's so sad that this movie didn't continue the greatness of that film. If you didn't see the movie yet, stay far away but it's probably too late.
0765356147|2.0|Then you'll love The Hero of Ages!    I hate to come down so hard on this series because I really did enjoy Elantris and believe that Sanderson, were he to slow down a bit, maybe, and edit himself a good bit more, could grow into a truly excellent fantasy writer. Sadly, though, it looks like he's headed in the wrong direction.    The Hero of Ages begins well with a nice scene in which our new emperor sweeps into a small village and helps the locals fight off the teeming blue hoards just long enough for Vin come crashing in to save the day. Well done!     Unfortunately, it's downhill from there. Endless introspection from each character about feelings and feelings about feelings. And no sense from anyone of the enormity of what's going on. The world is ending in ash and ice and yet we get very little sense of what that really means. Sure, there's the obligatory line about ash being brushed from a shoulder and how difficult it is to keep a white uniform clean with all the ash. But it always seems like nothing more than an afterthought.     Yes, the overarching plot has some interest in it. The magical system is kind of cool (if a bit like some kind of arcane game like Magic the Gathering). But in the end it is really not worth the effort. This is a very very poor book.
032147404X|5.0|This is a must buy book. I am not a book reader fan, but when it comes to Scott Kelby way of arranging the book flow it becomes interesting.    Personally I don't like to read but this book was pulling me to read every chapter and wanted to complete it in order to know what is hidden in the next topic.    The book goes straight to the point, it's like going to a photo-shoot spot with a professional photographer. When you have a question of how to take a particular photo, what lens to use, what accessories you need to use, what is the camera setting that your camera must be, etc. and need a pro to answer it, then you can simply take out this book, check the index for the title you need, go to that page and wala you will get your answer.    The only thing you need to keep in mind is that this is a practical and not theoretical book, i.e. this book will not give you what is ISO, Shutter Speed, Aperture, Exposure, etc. in details and what are the difference between them and shows you the result between each ISO setting and so on, rather it will provide you how to use all this in order to get the desired phot result.    In conclusion, my advice if you are new to photography and want to know the basics in order to be a pro, first buy a book that explains the basics of photography (such as: The Betterphoto Guide to Digital Photography by Jim Miotke, which I have and it's a very useful book), and then buy this book because as I stated above this is a practical and not a theoretical book.
B002B4AAS0|4.0|I've been listening to CD from time to time and I love it is a solid album but after Blinking Lights and other Revelations I feel that its near impossible to top that. The album for me has been a great slow burn and it totally works as concept album and I hate concept albums because they usually come off pretentious this does not it's a must buy for fans.    Here are some seriously choice tracks:  In My Dreams  Tremendous Dynamite  All the Beautiful Things  Beginners Luck(which is my absolute favorite track)

Start with the series and finish with the movie for full understanding of the characters.    A must have!
1439102813|5.0|I really love this book! It's so well written and it gives such a good reflection of what it means to become an Alzheimer's patient at a fairly young age (50). I was deeply moved and finished it in just one day.  You can tell Lisa Genova is a PhD professor and it's very interesting (and awesome!)to see how she \\"weaves\\" her knowledge through this incredible gripping story. I felt so sorry for Alice and her family. Having a mom with Alzheimer's made it even more compelling to me and I have shed quite some tears while reading this book.   I will definitely recommend this book to my sisters and bookclub. As a matter of fact; I will recommend it to everyone!  Way to go Lisa Genova!!Can't wait for the next book!
0765350386|2.0|While Mistborn itself is actually a fairly enjoyable book taken by itself, my advice to fantasy readers looking for a compelling read would be to avoid this series altogether. The second two books are long winded beyond belief and the quality of the writing is very poor. The freakin' world is ending and the principal characters are sitting around chit chatting about their feelings. Sanderson does know how to bring a story to a conclusion, so that's certainly a point in his favor. You won't get stranded with a cliffhanger after 12 books and 15 years as with some writers I could name.    Still, this is one series I wish I'd taken a pass on.
B00000J7JO|5.0|1999's Californication was the first Chili Peppers album I ever owned.  It quickly became my favorite album of that time.  I immediatly went out to discover the rest of their back catalogue.  Is it their best?  I don't know.  It's certainly a classic.  Then again, so are Freaky Styley (RUN OUT and buy it if you don't already own it, the most forgotten and therefore underrated Chili Peppers album), Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar (although the most frequently over-hyped, over-rated RHCP), and I have to say, the blistering 28-track Stadium Arcadium.  Sentimentally, Californication would have to be my favorite, though.  Songs like Easily, Get on Top, This Velvet Glove, Parallel Universe, Right on Time, and Purple Stain, were not singles off of this album, but only God knows why.  They are hard-rock treasures, and if all you've heard from this album is the singles (ie:scar tissue), you are committing a musical felony against yourself.
B001P5Q6F2|1.0|This cd bites. I prayed that with the signing to a major label would not change the sound, but it did. The aggressivness of the first three cd's (New American Gospel, As the Palace Burs and Ashes of the Wake) is noticably absent, as is Randy's signature growls, grunts and grools. I am saddened because they had a promising career. Do you remember when NAG crashed the planet with 'Black Label'? That record is A M A Z I N G! It seems as though, some bands start out blistering and turn sour. LOG, Metallica, Cryptopsy (Lord Worm RULES).
1402766785|2.0|I've seen it written on more than one occasion that George Bridgman's work is one of the touchstones of anatomic drawing for the artistically-inclined. While I don't want to contradict these august individuals, I have to offer a caveat - this book is only helpful depending on your particular artistic style and skill level, so buyer certainly beware.    This book, which is tremendously thick, lays out Bridgman's understanding of the artistic rendering of the human form. Bridgman is very interested in the overall architectural structure of the body, and as such draws in a very geometric style based in blocking in the figure with shapes and, essentially, \\"carving\\" out those shapes to create the figure. The illustrations in this book are drawn in a sketchy, pen-and-ink style and, while some of his illustrations are helpful (his renderings of the legs and arms in particular), I have found very little that I've been able to learn from in this book, which is unfortunate. If your mind works on a more structural level, then this may just be the book for you. However, I'd recommend getting a better grasp on your anatomy first. Good books in that regard, geared towards the artist, include Burne Hogarth's legendary [[ASIN:0823015521 Dynamic Anatomy: Revised and Expanded Edition]] and David K. Rubens' briefer, but essential [[ASIN:0140042431 The Human Figure: An Anatomy for Artists]]. For those with an interest in comic books, Christopher Hart's [[ASIN:0823023982 Drawing Cutting Edge Anatomy: The Ultimate Reference for Comic Book Artists]] is useful as well.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is album is pure genius. blink-182 is hilarious but some songs have suprisingly dark meanings. Thus though they may come off as immature, they really can be anything but. The songs are catchy and great. All the Small Things and What's My Age Again are fun and catchy. All of the songs are great, minus Anthem, which I don't particurally like, but Adam's Song is hands down the best. It is meaningful and moving.   Just buy this album. It's great.

They stuck to basic structres of the genre, but added horns and jazzy sonics.<br /><br />But more than any type of music, success or falure is in the playing, which creates the soul. Savoy Brown has no superior in this department. They have the most earthy grit and the shiniest polish needed to make thier twelve bars life blood.<br /><br />No need to go on about this. Buy their records and play them, a lot. You'll feel what I mean. If not, consult your local embalmer--you're bear food.<br /><br />Every now and again, I try a modern rock band, play the CDs, and they become dust collectors.  It is not the writting. It is not the production. It is that these kids think guitar playing starts with Eddie Van Halen. THEY DON'T KNOW THEIR BLUES!<br /><br />No young axman or women should wonder in to this trap.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I just did level 1 of the 30 day shred for the first time and, trust me people, it is hard. I like that the exercises and movements are all very straight forward - these are all moves that you don't need to be coordinated to be able to do.

I can definitely see why this dvd has gotten such high ratings.
0785814531|4.0|Edgar Allan Poe was more than another great writer. He was the ferryman to a world where all earthly norms fall away, and sense becomes nonsense. In his introduction to this volume, Wilbur Scott describes the goal of Poe's poetry being \\"to move the reader from the quotidian world of fact and tedium into a transcendent world of supernal loveliness.\\"<br /><br />Same with many of his tales, also produced here, with this important addendum: Sometimes the world Poe takes you do is not any fancy land at all; but a bleak, rocky chasm with no bottom.<br /><br />Poe's been dead 160 years, but he's still THE man of American letters, the one classic American author ordinary people are eager to read. Of his stories, which I prefer to his poems just because I'm that kind of guy, you have an array of macabre milestones like \\"The Cask Of Amontillado\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\", \\"Hop-Frog\\", \\"The Man Of The Crowd\\", and my favorite from middle school, \\"The Tell-Tale Heart.\\"<br /><br />You also have a rousing detective story, \\"The Purloined Letter\\", and even some fine humor pieces that are less well-known, like \\"The Spectacles,\\" \\"The Man That Was All Used Up\\", and \\"The Business Man\\". \\"A Predicament\\" presents us with the story of a woman so bent on trying to be macabre that she writes lovingly, excessively, of her own decapitation. Poe was apparently satirizing a popular ghoulish fiction magazine of the time, though he seems to be sending up himself. The laughs are still there more than 150 years later.<br /><br />\\"The loss of the eye was not so much as the insolent air of independence and contempt with which it regarded me after it was out,\\" Poe has the narrator relate affectedly. \\"There it lay in the gutter just under my nose, and the airs it gave itself would have been ridiculous had they not been disgusting.\\"<br /><br />So why only four stars? I took one off for the presentation, and one off for the entirety of Poe (sentences to be served concurrently). This edition is bare bones, nothing but the prose and poems, aside from Scott's introduction, with no attempts at placing recondite items of Poe's in historical context, or even furnishing likely writing dates. If any author cries out for a loving editor who sticks his or her nose into things to help explain the writer, it's Poe. I'm sure not going to figure out what he was trying to do with \\"X-ing A Paragrab\\" on my ownsome.<br /><br />No author is going to shine as brightly with the whole of their work before you, not if it's Shakespeare, and certainly not if it's Poe. In some ways he's overrated (\\"The Pit And The Pendulum\\" is a tension-filled potboiler with a nonsensical ending, though at least its short, which can not be said of the silly \\"Narrative Of Arthur Gordon Pym\\"). In others, he's just a little too in love with his own vocabulary. \\"The Domain Of Arnhem\\" is a great example of how quickly Poe can send you to Eldorado by putting you to sleep with a story going nowhere.<br /><br />Finally, Poe is very morbid. Death is a constant presence in his stories, and sometimes it gets the better of him, like in \\"Mesmeric Revelation\\", when a person who dies under hypnosis conducts a metaphysics seminar from beyond the grave. It would be better if the compilers of this book spread out the \\"Buried Lady\\" stories, rather than ran them all together like a cattle train.<br /><br />The nice thing about a book like this is the opportunity to find a lost treasure, like \\"The System Of Doctor Tarr And Professor Fether\\" or \\"The Gold Bug\\", ironically Poe's biggest financial success in his lifetime though now deemed racist in many quarters. And of course you have the greatest poem in the world, for someone like me who needs the poet to do all the work: \\"The Raven\\". Even if the rest of this collection was a pile of hay, the Hope Diamond would still be the Hope Diamond buried within it.prose and poems, aside from Scott's introduction, with no attempts at placing recondite items of Poe's in historical context, or even furnishing likely writing dates.

1416594884|5.0|A John le Carre book is not for those who thrive on Jack Reacher fantasy.    In \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" le Carre again goes deep and complex showing all the skills that he has displayed in presenting the world of international espionage long after the good guys and bad guys of the Cold War have passed, at least temporarily, from the scene.    However, while he has been quite successful in spanning the gap and globally shifting focus he has also had what appears to be a deep metamorphous in his views of who are the good guys and who are the bad. In some of his more recent efforts his outlook is a bit excessive. His skepticism overwhelmes reality. The \\"us\\" has become \\"them.\\" Capitalism became the enemy and America  and Britain the evil doers.    In this effort he is more complex and nuanced. A Chechen born fugitive, the spawn of a Russian military monster escapes to Hamburg, Germany where he becomes the central pawn in an international competition between the various agencies fighting \\"terrorism,\\" with each agency, both inter and intramural, intruiging  against each other to prevail and score the goal which they all see differently.    Excellent character development leaves the reader deep in a plot that can be looked at from the variety of facets that le Carre always focuses on. Tommy Brue, an aging cuckolded Scottish (sort of) banker seeking love, meaningfulness and redemption; Annabel, an attractive idealistic German lawyer trying to make amends for her family's  just so behavior; Issa the sweet Chechen bastard and Signpost the noted high ranking  Muslim Imam who is only \\"5% bad\\", are played and positioned by the competitors of the secret world.    In the end the CIA does it's thing. So much for the good guys of yore
B00260HH3K|5.0|If this movie is compared to the anime (with all the changes in mind) it seems to take place between Dragonball and Dragonball Z, which makes it hard to compare.  If you saw the screen shots before it came out that showed a white colored piccolo you might have been put off, but the end result was impressive to me.  They managed to capture the silly childlike and optimistic mind of Goku, the attitude of Piccolo, the bubbly silly and nerdy aspects of Bulma, the explosiveness a young Chi-chi should have had, and the goofiness and perversion of Master Roshi.  Keep in mind that it captured all of these things in a weakened form because 3 foot high plastic wigs, day long arial floating near-light-speed combat, and more epsodes than you can shake scores of sticks at all don't fit into a Hollywood live action movie.  If you become sad that things were tonned down, then you might be looking for something along the lines of a Power Rangers movie with punkrock hairdos.  Sadly, I don't know of anything released in the US that was like that, except perhaps Fist of the North Star, which was also very good and very hated for being bizarre.  Dragonball Z seems to be the main inspiration for the characters in this film, and Dragonball Z was the \\"WWF: World Wrestling Federation!\\" of Japanese animation.  There has never been a serious attempt at a movie starring WWF characters that have super powers and giant hairdos, so there may be a reason for that fact.  In the meantime, I suggest people try to watch this movie with an open mind, expecting to see the characters they loved played by an excellent crew, the comedy they hopefully got from the anime, some bits of DBZ action, and a light-hearted optimistic attitude that has somehow made the jump from anime to U.S. made movie.  I feel this movie does Dragonball Z justice.  I also think a truly rediculous live action film like the kind Japan sometimes does (including EVERYTHING from the anime) would also be a fun thing to watch, if only for the comedy of it.  Either way, no ticket sales for a story like this.or the comedy of it.  Either way, no ticket sales for a story like this.
B000N4SHPS|2.0|Rocky Balboa is the final installment of the Rocky films and boy was I disappointed! I just hated this film, Adrian is dead, Rocky is working in an Italian resturant, he is estranged from his son, and he tries to make an ill-fated comeback in the boxing world. This film was praised so much by critcs and fans so I thought, well I've seen all the Rocky films - why not give the last one a try? I remember watching this in the theatre and just dreading every moment. Stallone looks miserable (nice plastic surgery, not!), the writing is absolutely corny and stale and the premise is depressing. I really tried to like this film but I felt something was missing. Stick to the first 5 Rocky films, those are worth every penny.

B0015HOFZI|3.0|As others have reported, there are problems being able to hear what you're recording while you're recording it. Problems? Actually I couldn't hear anything using only the USB attachment, and I did try to copy some of the advice given by other reviewers. But the turntable comes with two RCA plugs, and after visiting two Radio Shack stores and spending a lot of time examining the different possible connection pieces, I purchased two separate connectors  for $11 that allowed me to connect the RCA plugs directly to my computer speakers and voila, I now can hear what I'm recording. Why is that important? Because for the albums I recorded over the weekend, the software did not recognize the tracks, and so if you don't babysit the process, you record each side of the album as one track, which is OK if you want to listen to the whole side of an album, but if you don't like certain tracks or would like to be able to listen to them separately, then you have to record them one at a time. And figuring out where to put the needle to begin, and when the track is over, without being able to hear anything is rather hit or miss. Why SONY doesn't make this easier is anybody's guess, but this process certainly impacted my rating of this turntable, though it works fine once you do the work arounds.    Here's something else I discovered. If you leave the USB plug in your computer,  or at least in mine, then you can't listen to any sounds (iTunes, CD) coming out of your computer until you pull the plug out. You can plug it back in, without recording another song, and not affect the speakers connected to the back of the computer. So it's not the USB plug (obviously or this would happen to anything you plugged in) and is a software glitch. And I just updated the software, so they haven't fixed it.

If you haven't read the graphic novel, you may not be able to follow all the movie's plot points closely, and may be disappointed by the film.  Suggest you first read the graphic novel, which is outstandingly brilliant, and then you may want to proceed to the film.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors 1: Val and Earl are 2 handymen in an isolated little desert town. Tired of the place they decide to leave. However, they come across a dead body and return to report it. A man has climbed up a pole and died of thirst. Attached to their car they find something weird. At first they believe it's part of a snake, they will soon find that it's way more exotic. And deadly. The phones are dead, and soon the little town of Perfection, Nevada, discovers the killers, giant underground worms with a taste for meat. The worms are tough, strong and quite smart.  Enter survivalist couple Heather and Burt Gummer, who, prepared for commie invasion, have an entire arsenal of weapons. They're gonna need it...    Tremors 2: Aftershocks: Earl is invited to go graboid hunting in Mexico. At 50 000 $ per worm, he thinks it's a sweet deal. He quickly realises he's in too deep and he contacts Burt Gummer. Together they find that the graboids have a surprise for them. The graboids are changing...    Tremors 3: Back to Perfection: Burt has been in South America hunting graboids. As he returns to Perfection, he finds that a lot has changed. Jodi, niece of merchant Walter who died in T1, has turned the store into a graboid themed shop. A new character, Desert Jack, takes tourists on graboid safari. And Mel, who was a teenager in T1, has returned and wants to build condos in the desert.  No one has seen the worms for 11 years. Now they return. No longer cut off from the world, the citizens of Perfection contact the authorities. The worms being big desert reptiles, become protected under the laws regarding conservation of species, and illegal to kill. Which also means that Mel can't develop the land, to Perfection's joy.   The worms start developing into shriekers, but the shriekers aren't the final stage in the graboids' evolution.  This movie introduces Desert Jack, Jodi and El Blanco, who were so important in the TV series.     Tremors 4: the legend begins: the year is 1889. In the small mining town in Rejection, Nevada, some eggs hatch...  And soon miners start dying. Enter Hiram Gummer, mine owner and...wimp.  It's a hoot to see the ancestors of the main characters from T1 - T3, how they interact and how they ended up in this little desert town. Not to mention the beginning of the graboids!     All 4 Tremors movies are great. They're exciting, entertaining and fun. Part horror, part splatter, part comedy, part monster movie, I have seen all 4 several times and I haven't tired of them yet. In fact, I'm hungry for more!  All the main characters are quite eccentric, without making it stupid, adding to the entertainment value. Each movie reveals something new about the worms.     I highly recommend this collection.

B001DSNF8C|4.0|I was never a big fan of 007 movies. The last one I saw was with Roger Moore and I don't remember the title. I took a chance on this one because some friends said it was good.  I really liked Casino Royale. Lots of good action. There were 3 times I thought the movie was over as if everything got taken care of by Bond then all of a sudden, there's another twist. The entire movie kept me interested and I'm glad I bought it.
B0025X4P24|5.0|The best way that I can describe this album is with the word \\"Beautiful.\\" Also, I think that there's a touch of melancholy in this album that I wasn't used to at first, but it took me a couple of listens to this album before I came to really like it.    Also, I would recommend not to look at the credits or the insert book until after having this album for several weeks or a month, so that you can be surprised by some of the writers and producers on this album.
B000002KET|4.0|Black Sabbath deliver another album full of their usual brand of metal and quirky oddities. Lead singer 'Ozzy' Osbourne also attains his high water mark for singing, I think.<br /><br />  Best track:<br /><br />Fluff - long time listeners to this band will know that from their second album onwards, they always brought out one or two tracks per album afterwards which were utterly quirky. This is one of their better ones. An instrumental featuring multiple accoustic guitars, piano, and perhaps a harpsichord type instrument or some such. An electric guitar also features in the lead position, but plays some country flavoured sounds. Melodic, with a hint of John Mason Williams and Bach (I'm guessing...someone like that...I'm not a classical music nerd).<br /><br />  Next best:<br /><br />Who are you - an interesting sounding track featuring the synthesiser, bass and drums. The piano enters the fray later on. A slow tempo song<br /><br />  Best of the rest:<br /><br />A national acrobat - has a pretty riff, which I like the most from this song, as well as the vocals here. Also has a poppy melodic bit near the end of the song.<br /><br />Looking for today - a rock track but with poppy parts. Has a pretty vocal melody, for the title, I think. Features handclapping sounds and one bit makes use of the flute or some such instrument. I like the bluesy lead guitar and the drum outro.<br /><br />  The rest:<br /><br />Sabbath bloody sabbath - one of those Frankenstein type songs I allude to in my header - a Jekyll and Hyde type song, if you will: has a heavy metal riff but is easy listening in other parts. Ozzy is at his vocal best in this song, I think, and the track has a heavy beat. The opening riff to this song reminded me of Metallica's later classic \\"The memory remains\\" of their brilliant \\"Reload\\" album (a great hard rock album, under-appreciated by the band's core 'thrash' fans).<br /><br />Sabra cadabra - a heavy riffing love song. Also features the piano and the bass isnoticeable. I like the drum outro to this song.<br /><br />Killing yourself to live - a heavy rock track where the bass guitar is more noticeable than usual. Some of the guitar work has a 'gurgling' quality to it.<br /><br />Spiral architect - has an accoustic guitar intro which later morphs into something which sounds like Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's \\"Love the one you're with\\". Track also features the violins (or a synth mimicking this). The rock bits of this song reminds one of The Who for the electric guitar and drums. Occasionally the stereo soundstage seems to drop out.<br /><br />  On first listen, I was leaning towards giving this album 7/10, but on second listen I think I'll give it 75/100. If you like this album, I think you'll like pretty much everything that this band has done from \\"Master of reality\\" onwards. They are pretty consistent with their output. Alternatively, if you like those other albums, I don't think that this album will disappoint. Personally, I think that \\"Paranoid\\" is far and away their best album, but \\"Master of reality\\" is their next best up to the time of this album here. \\"Sabotage\\" would surpass \\"Master of reality\\", when that came out, I think.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Okay, so I am not the biggest Muse fan. I do have 2 albums of theirs. But I am tired of all this negative feedback about how they are ripping off Radiohead.  I like The Bends and O.K. Computer, but other than that you can keep Radiohead.  In one instance, yes, Muse have a similar sound to EARLY Radiohead.  But as of late, not even close.  My biggest obstacle with Radiohead anymore is that I can't find the grooves, as lame as that sounds.  I sit there and try to figure out how genius it all is, but then I forget that I am supposed to enjoy what it is that I am listening to! They are very progressive and experimental, but I get lost in the translation between melody and originality.  Muse brings out the good qualities of earlier Radiohead-great riffs, great lyrics, and just great overall songwriting. And they do it all while you sing along and actually feel the music and get enveloped in it. If you want to hear how different something is, sure, go for Radihead. But if you want to rock out and have a quality album that you are going to listen to over and over, go for Muse. It's much more grounded and accessible. That's my 2 cents.

B002EWD08Q|5.0|Heavy and dark best describes the Arctic Monkeys new sound on their third CD. Despite their protestations to the contrary, they sound more mature and fans of their previously more frenetic fare (\\"I bet you look good on the dancefloor\\", \\"Brianstorm\\" to mention a few) may be sorely disappointed. It falls somewhere between the Arctic Monkeys sound of old and lead vocalist Alex Turner's more symphonic side project Last Shadow Puppets.<br /><br />The CD comprises just 10 tracks, opening with \\"My propeller\\" which finds Alex Turner practically crooning to a gently rocking backdrop. \\"My propeller won't spin/and I can't get it started on my own/when are you arriving\\".<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"Crying lightning\\" is filled with crunchy riffs and chiming guitars and should be a favourite of fans of their old sound. Lovely!<br /><br />Other standouts are the stomping \\"Secret door\\" (with a nice acoustic intro), the sombre \\"The fire and the thud\\", the charming chiming ballad \\"Cornerstone\\" (about picking up girls in pubs), the beautiful ambient \\"Dance little liar\\", \\"Pretty visitors\\" (filled with angular guitars and irregular drum patterns, the closest to their old sound), and closing \\"The jeweller's hands\\" (sounding like some score to some suspense movie, with a swirling psychedelic-sounding coda, think \\"505\\" from \\"Favourite worst nightmare\\").<br /><br />Their lyrics, as usual, tell fabulous stories; \\"The inevitables gather to push you around/Any old voice makes a punishing sound/He became laughter's assassin/Shortly after he showed you what it was\\" from \\"The jeweller's hands\\".<br /><br />This album is edgy and experimental, and I'm glad to see Turner and the lads not content to remain in their comfort zone. A grower, but one that richly rewards at the end.
B001L2EE9Y|5.0|The first Joni Mitchell song I ever listened to was the poetic, voyeuristic \\"River\\", when I had just turned thirteen. Frankly, I was stunned. It was so icy and confessional lyrically, and so longing and wishful and raw vocally - I was blown away. Joni throws herself out in the open, pining: \\"I wish I had a river / to skate away on.../I wish I had a river so long / I would teach my feet to fly\\". The aching vulnerability of this song is both breathtaking and familiar.  I knew at once that I had to purchase her entire album, \\"Blue\\", and I was in no way disappointed.    The album opens with the simulataneously lovesick and hopeful \\"All I Want\\". Joni's birdlike trill brings her poetry to life and is carried by the beautiful melody woven by her skillful fingers. In all of these songs, Joni's lyrics have a very distinct vulnerability - not only featured in \\"River\\", but throughout the album - that I can connect with. In 1979, Joni reflected on Blue, saying she had \\"no personal defenses in her life\\" at the time and felt like \\"a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes\\". These feelings she was experiencing during the composition and recording of Blue are very apparent throughout, and endeared me to her.    Following \\"All I Want\\" are some other brillant tracks: \\"My Old Man\\", a song describing the joys and sorrows of a live-in romantic relationship; \\"Little Green\\", the beautiful, sensitive ode to Joni's relinquished daughter, Kelly Green, tinged with regret, and filled with wishes for a good life to her child; the rollicking \\"Carey\\", describing Joni's time spent with a \\"mean old daddy\\" or \\"bright red devil\\" on a Grecian isle who is also referenced in \\"California\\"; the piercingly honest \\"Blue\\", a zeitgeist of the times; the wonderful \\"California\\", in which Joni beseeches the object of her affections: \\"Will you take me as I am? / Will you take me as I am? Will you?\\" and again speaks of the \\"red, red rogue\\" or \\"redneck\\", Carey, \\"who gave her back her smile\\" but \\"kept her camerato sell\\"; the pensive, anxious \\"This Flight Tonight\\"; the lovely, ethereal \\"River\\", opening with an interpolation from \\"Jingle Bells\\" setting the Christmas-y tone; \\"A Case of You\\" about a deterioriating romantic relationship, and in which Joni compares a lover to \\"holy wine\\" that tastes \\"so bitter\\" but \\"so sweet\\". The album closes with the personal \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" in which Joni is told by Richard that \\"all romantics meet the same fate / someday cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark cafe\\" and proceeds to say, \\"You laugh, he said / you think you're immune / go look at your eyes, they're full of moon / you like roses and kisses / and pretty men to tell you all those pretty lies...\\"    After having listened to \\"Blue\\" countless times through after purchasing, I soon discovered that Joni and I share the same birthday, which I find inordinately exciting. Soon after I had found out, I was telling one of my friends, \\"Oh my gosh! I almost forgot to tell you! I have the same birthday as Joni Mitchell!\\" To which she responded, \\"Who's Joni Mitchell?\\" and I think something inside of me might have actually died in that moment. It is so important for my generation to hear her music - it's not dated at all. Every word still rings as true as they did the day they were written. So, if you're a teenager like me, please don't be put off by the fact that this is \\"old\\" music. I assure you that her lyrics are just as applicable to your life as they were to someone our age when the album was originally released.    \\"Blue\\" came to me in a time when I needed it most. I'm almost fifteen now and I will keep \\"Blue\\" close to my heart as I cross over the threshold between childhood and adulthood. I know that Joni's words will comfort me in times of need. \\"Blue\\" is a treasure, plain and simple - a true gift from the heart of Joni Mitchell. I beg you to buy this. You will not regret it.
B002EULANU|5.0|I absolutely love this cd and it is definitely a tease with only 9 tracks! To be honest, I really did not believe that Maxwell would ever make another cd.  He just simply fell off the face of the earth to rediscover the music, reinvite his self and live life. It is one of my favorite cds to date. This cd is a soundtrack to my current relationship from Playing Possum to a Pretty Wings. And Phoenix Rise plays as a reminder to those things I need to rise up for.     What a great cd! Thank you for the music, Maxwell.
B002EWD08Q|5.0|At first this album seems too slow and different to be appreciated as much as the previous two efforts. However, after 2 or 3 listens it really becomes a fantastic display of Arctic Monkeys' incredible musical talent. This album creeps up on you and eventually you start playing the songs over and over in your head just like all the other Arctic Monkeys songs to date. Though at first it may seem void of hooks or energy on second, third, fourth listen it is clearly there and as good as ever.     Track 1. My Propeller: Fantastic opener. Starts out slow and builds up to a fantastic climax, setting the tone for the rest of the album. The drums are catchy and the lyrics as good as ever. 4.5/5  Track 2. Crying Lightning: Everyone knows enough about this song already, it's good. 5/5  Track 3. Dangerous Animals: This song took me a couple listens to enjoy but the drums that kick in towards the final third of the song really seal the deal for me. It's a lot catchier than it seems at first and is one of the stand out tracks in my opinion. 5/5  Track 4. Secret Door: Seems to be an early favorite among the fans. Unlike most of the other songs on \\"Humbug\\", this one starts out with lots of energy and a great full sound and then builds down to a surprisingly catchy hook. 5/5  Track 5. Potion Approaching: Probably one of the least  radio friendly songs on the album, still has a very full sound and grows on you after a few listens. 4/5  Track 6. Fire and the Thud: Amazing atmosphere in this song, and a very subtle build towards the end. This one is DEFINITELY a grower, you may disregard it at first but, trust me, that's a mistake. Beautiful work. 5/5  Track 7. Cornerstone: Another early fan favorite, easy to sing along too, somewhat reminiscent of Fluorescent Adolescent, Mardy Bum, etc. 4.5/5  Track 8. Dance Little Liar: A lot like Fire and the Thud in that it may be discarded upon the first two listens or so but this song has a very subtle build up again and after a few listens is one of my favorite tracks. 5/5  Track 9. Pretty Visitors: Amazing drums, purely amazing. The lyrics are insane and somewhat incoherent but the song has all the kick of previous AM tracks and more. Great energy on this track. 5/5  Track 10. Jeweller's Hands: Good song to end on, grows on you just like the entire album. Not as good as 505 or A Certain Romance but still a great way to end it. 4.5/5    The music is still very rich and the lyrics are certainly daring. Great Album. Overall, I give it a 9.5/10.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|My friends and I rented this thinking it was going to be one of those terribly done films you typically see on the sci fi channel. Once we started watching the film however our expectations were cast aside as we quickly discovered that there was a lot of effort put into this film. If you can get over the fact that there are alien races out there that are for all intensive purposes \\"human\\" this is a really fun film. I wouldn't spend a lot of money buying it but if I saw it for under ten bucks I figure it would justify the buy.<br /><br />My verdict is that this is great for a group of guys looking for a fun  popcorn movie.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|It's amazing that this show has only gotten better each season, not resting on its laurels but continuing to develop.  It's a toss up for me if II or III is my favorite, but III is the most powerful.  Jimmy Smits gives what may be the performance of his career (I haven't seen his recent series).  He is amazing and his Miguel and Dexter play off of each other to perfection.  Deb is also developing and has a strong role.  They manage to keep her quirks and still mature her character.  The writing is brilliant, the look of the show beautiful.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Irei escrever em português, já que sou um cliente brasileiro do site amazon.  Comprei o filme Christine do site Amazon.com, e adorei o atendimento, a entrega, e o proprio filme. A edição comemorativa possui dublagem clássica em português, vários extras, e está com um preço sensacional.  Recomendo a todos!
B0007CNXUU|5.0|I bought this dvd a couple of months ago, but didn't watch it until last weekend, twice.  I waited so long to watch it because I thought this movie was all computer generated graphics and star dust, a movie best experienced with one's brain running at idle.  Was I wrong.<br /><br />This movie is engaging, enchanting, and funny, but also bittersweet because it deals with the passing of a family member.  You will laugh and cry with the characters as their lives unfold.  The production is set in 1903 England and is said to be based on real events.<br /><br />The movie is about the goings-on in the life of the playwriter, James Barrie when he wrote \\"Peter Pan\\".  A man who is about 30 going on 13, who would rather clown-it-up at the formal dinner table with his new pre-adolescent friends than engage his socialite wife and her new social contact.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is perfectly cast in this story and all the female costars glow with beauty and talent.  The children can act beyond their years.  I'm just going to say that there is something to enjoy in this story for everyone from 5 on up.
B000002J03|4.0|Hard to believe that this and the self-titled were released within one year of another. Both played an immense impact on Rock and Roll while advancing already set standards from earlier and contemporary acts such as The Yardbirds,Cream, Jimmi Hendrix Experience and Ten Years After. Zeppelin further placed the guitar riff as pivotal to a rock song and chose to be louder and heavier which was puncuated by the seperation of the bass and drum sound which added heavier bottom weight to these classics.    In many ways however, this is not a superior album than it's predecessor. It's practically an extension, not a bad thing, but the band would create and better and more complex work starting with there next album and than on.    Zeppelin is often cited as being \\"Heavy Metal\\" but in fact they only really flirted with the sound, never quite escaping from the blues and far too folksy and accoustic happy than contemporaries Deep Purple and Black Sabbath who really cemented the heavy sound. Yet, much is to be owed towards this seminal release.    \\"Led Zeppellin 2\\" features many of the band's signature cuts beginning with one of there most beloved tracks in the form of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". Unquestionably a classic, the song has unfortunately been overplayed much too often and it's importance lies mianly in it's chugging iconic riff. \\"Heartbreaker\\" is simple heavy blues and appears rather dated but it's importance is unquestionable. \\"Living Loving Maid\\" is often paired with this track and is not a personal favorite of guitarist Jimmy Page. It's an enjoyable enough toe tapper that seems to be the direct ancestor to the later and superior, \\"Rock and Roll\\" off of there classic fourth album.    \\"Ramble On\\" endures as a excellent example of proto-Metal with a classic riff and a structure that would influence many bands to follow, what with it's soft, melodic intro and excellent rock to finish mid section. The lyrics also showcase the band's fascination with fantasy and that will playa definitive influence on later Power acts and certainly contemporary Uriah Heep who practically specialized in that field.    \\"Moby Dick\\" is a bit ponderous but satisfying due to the enormous drum talent of John Bonham whose skills are perhaps best represented by this mighty instrumental. It goes on overlong but it's difficult not to be impressed by such a masterly performance.    The remainder of the album is drenched in the blues dragged through heaviness. Several are classics including that ode to great Blues man Robert Johnson, \\"The Lemon Song\\" whith it's wonderfully provacative lyrics. \\"Bring it on Home\\" and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" are very bluesy. \\"Bring it on Home\\" evokes even something of a honkytonk style in it's first half before surrendering to heaviness.     \\"Thank You\\" is practically a preview of the band's third album as it is almost entirely accoustic. It is also one of the album's most satisfying and emotional works and ranks among this band's best songs.    There is much dated about this album but it's importance is notable and a listen is absolutely essential to anyone who remotely considers him/herself a rocker or Metalhead. Certainly the riffs of Page and the vocal stylings of Robert Plant will continue to influence many would bes and it is difficult to think how many will enjoy the longevity of this band and this milestone release made some forty years ago.
0307460444|5.0|I love this book, Martha Stewart is alright (you can find recipes some of these cupcakes on her website too) I already made one recipe, which is the tiramisu cupcake, and everyone loved them. The ingredients for some of the fancier cupcakes are hard to find and pretty pricey. I suggest just replacing them with the similar and more accessible ingredient. (example: vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean) Other than that it is a great book and helps to inspire your creativity.
0307454541|5.0|I have originally purchased this book with some hesitation for my vacation.  And boy, was I wrong. I couldn't part with it for 3 days:)<br /><br />This is a story about two individuals, from different walks of life and backgrounds. Salander is an abused young girl, who learned how to take care of herself from an early age.  She is extremely private and is a life long fighter.  One missing issue:  how did Salander end up in the foster care?  What was wrong with her family other than her mother was not lucid enough to take care of her?  What happened to her sister Camilla?<br /><br />Salander and Blomkvist couldn't be completely different; yet, they are attracted to each other like magnets.  Their teamwork is what helps them to solve Vanger disapperance and discover the secrets within that dysfunctional family.<br /><br />This book also made me fall in love with Sweden again. I was there long time ago but never reached Norrland.  Larsson's description of his homeland make you want to go back there yourself and immerse in the culture and history of this nation.<br /><br />Overall:  a fantastic book.  Can't wait to read the next one!
0553266306|5.0|This is the most suspenseful book I have ever read bar none. It is a must read. Most of the nearly 400 pages of the book are one continuous race against time to the ending. The only thing I can think to compare it to is the beginning of Hitchcock's Psycho which builds suspense for the first half of the movie continuously, only this may be even more of a feat. It makes me want to ready all of Forsyth's books. I stayed up until 2 am, reading the last 100 or so pages.
B001EO748M|5.0|I absolutely love this series on SHO.  I wasn't a fan until the 3rd season this year.  When I discovered it and finally watched it on cable, I was hooked.  I knew I had to buy the seasons 1 & 2 to catch up. I will also be buying season 3 when it comes out on DVD. The wardrobe and jewelry are exquisite.  Although some parts of the series is a little off from the actual history, the acting by Jonathan Rhys Meyers as King Henry VIII and fellow cast members are fantastic!  I am fascinated by this era. I can watch this over and over again!  I cannot wait for the 4th season to come out on SHO in April 2010.
0545123267|5.0|Let's start off by calling this book what it is - brain candy.  Yup, the same brain candy that is Twilight.  It isn't going to win a Pulitzer, but it is going to win the hearts of many, many readers.  I was compelled from the first paragraph to finish the story, didn't feel that there were really any slow spots.  Grace is getting compared to Bella, but she isn't so needy.  She isn't the victim the whole time who needs to be constantly rescued.      This isn't as squeaky clean as Twilight but still more than appropriate for teens.  I can not wait for the second book!!!

B001U0HBPG|5.0|I'm kind of surprised that the ratings for this movie aren't overwhelmingly five stars.  Maybe it comes down to expectations?  If so, please be sure to come to this movie with an open mind and an open heart.  This movie sets its sights high and aims to transport you, so you need to be willing to go on the journey.<br /><br />More specifically, like any truly great movie, this one succeeds in faithfully portraying a substantial range of the breadth and depth of the human experience.  We thus get to know all sorts of archetypally-significant characters from various walks of life, we witness a diverse spectrum of events ranging from the mundane to the extreme, and we're pushed to experience many emotions including regret, grief, fear, hope, courage, joy, and every kind of love.  All of this is done with a measured sensitivity and nuance, without ever going overboard into crass sensationalism.<br /><br />Perhaps the central lessons that I distilled from this movie are (a) that we should try to live each day fully rather than taking things for granted (especially our loved ones), and (b) that we should strive for courage and strength in facing the challenges and suffering that life inevitably presents.  These lessons may seem obvious, but we need reminders, and this movie reminds powerfully.<br /><br />I was deeply touched by this movie, and I rank it among the best that I've ever seen.  I certainly recommend it to anyone looking for something which goes beyond mere entertainment and instead shows us what art, at its best, can offer.<br /><br />Finally, let me just note that, if you loved Forrest Gump, you'll love this movie.  Likewise, if you didn't like Forrest Gump, you won't like this movie either.  To be clear, no, this movie isn't a sequel to Forrest Gump.  It's just that the two movies are crafted in quite similiar ways and thus have a similar effect on a receptive audience.  And that's a good thing!
B001QOOCTE|4.0|The CD is a little short, but the music is great with arrangements that could ONLY have come from this kind of project. The story is absolutely inspiring.
0385342020|5.0|I was a little disappointed at first because Twenties Girl didn't draw me in right away like  Kinsella's books do. (I think I just had to get used to the ghost, who was really rude & intrusive at first, & after all ~ a ghost)  However, within a few chapters I was hooked & couldn't put the book down.  I love anything vintage, so reading about Aunt Sadie's clothes, etc. from the 1920's was, for me, a cherry on top of a really good story. I don't like a good read to be over too quickly, so I liked the size of this book (435 pages)~ & even at that was really sorry when I reached the end.  I hope Sophie Kinsella is hard at work on her next novel because she never disappoints!  (Well technically she did - When I heard that her first novels were published under Madelaine Wickham, I ordered all of them - & what a major disappointment!  She went from really dull & boring as Wickham to genius as Kinsella.)
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie was bought for me by a friend who knew my obsession with period-piece movies and specifically all things Jane Austen. She scored because I rolled with laughter at this quirky Brittish tale where a modern day Londoner who is equally obsessed with Austen finds that a magical door into the world of Elizabeth Bennet opens up in her bathroom and Elizabeth herself walks out. Then, things happen and our new friend from modern day London winds up staying with Elizabeth's family while Elizabeth stays in London. Many many laughs come about from the various fish-out-of water scenarios and I happily recommend this to anyone who both loves period pieces and needs a good laugh!
B002EWD090|2.0|1) Emulate the sound of other bands like Cream, Black Sabbath, and a lot of The Last Shadow Puppets (Alex Turner's Side band)    2) Ditch the fresh sound that made you famous and adored, and sound like a depressing Queens of Stone Age tribute band.    3) Have no exciting songs and replace them with uninspired, slow, boring songs.    I am a big Arctic Monkeys fan but this new sound of theirs seems dull and uninspired. Some of you may love it, some might hate it, and some may be disappointed with it like me. I hope they ditch this dark phase of theirs and get back to the fast paced garage-rock they are known for     P.S: Do not look at the Crying Lightning music video its just bad all around the song rocks, but the video is horrifically cheesy and lame
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|This is Paramount's first chance to release MY FAIR LADY on DVD; following a lapse in the distribution/copyright formerly controlled by Warner Brothers.  No doubt they'll later include it in an Audrey Hepburn box-set with their other Hepburn titles (\\"Roman Holiday\\", \\"Funny Face\\" and \\"Sabrina\\" among them).<br /><br />MY FAIR LADY is a true cinema classic; one of the last major Hollywood musicals and the film which finally netted director George Cukor a belated Academy Award for 'Best Director'.  Based on the long-running Broadway musical and G.B. Shaw's \\"Pygmalion\\", the story follows the grooming of Cockney flower-seller Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) into a lady of refinement by linguistics professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison).  These two opposites could hardly be more different, until the day that Higgins admits he's \\"grown accustomed to her face\\"...<br /><br />With a star-studded supporting cast (Wilfred Hyde-White, Jeremy Brett, Gladys Cooper and Stanley Holloway chief among them) and the soaring score of Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, MY FAIR LADY is the glittering jewel which capped off the era of the great Hollywood musicals.  Seldom again would audiences be treated to such a sumptuous spectacle on the screen.<br /><br />Despite a huge critical backlash (concerning Julie Andrews not cementing her most acclaimed stage role on film), Audrey Hepburn gives a spirited performance as feisty Eliza.  She worked hard to get her limited singing voice into the necessary shape to meet the demands of the score, yet at the 11th hour was replaced by noted Hollywood \\"ghost singer\\" Marni Nixon.  Rex Harrison, having starred in both the Broadway and London productions of the show, was confident enough in his performance to sing his songs live (via a hidden microphone).  Stanley Holloway--another veteran of the stage show--also triumphantly reprises his role for the screen.<br /><br />Warner's previous double-disc Special Edition release (using the 1997 restored print of the film) was quite definitive.  I can't imagine how Paramount is going to top that release--unless they perform a new remaster of the 1997 print.  Still, MY FAIR LADY is one of those movies which deserves to always be in circulation, constantly enjoyed and discovered by new audiences.  I can only hope a shiny new Blu-ray release is just around the corner...<br /><br />EXTRA FEATURES:<br />* Audio commentary with restoration experts Robert Harris and James Katz, art director Gene Allen, and singer Marni Nixon<br />* Vintage featurettes, footage and audio<br />* Alternate Audrey Hepburn vocals<br />* poster and lobby card galleries (with Rex Harrison radio interview)<br />* \\"Comments On A Lady\\" interviews with Martin Scorcese and Andrew Lloyd Webber<br />* trailerse.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|Gladiator is a movie that I've eagerly anticipated on Blu-Ray for quite some time.  That excitement has now been quashed. I've looked at comparison screen shots over at AVS Forum, and the overemphasis of DNR and edge enhancement on the picture is shocking.  I will not support studios who charge top dollar and deliver sub-par quality.
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Despite issues with her private life, Whitney Houston has always have a place in my heart, having grown up with a mother who bought her music & still enjoying listening to her over the wannabe divas of today.    Currently unavailable in North America (mine's an import from Argentina) this is a great alternative to the 2-disc greatest hits collection of yesteryear despite missing a couple of my favorite songs (\\"You Give Good Love\\", \\"All The Man That I Need\\", & \\"Love Will Save the Day\\") which has more to do with space limitations (the disc clocks in at over 79 ½ minutes) then track selection, thought I'll gladly trade tracks 4, 8, & 18 to have those 3 in here.    Also, there's no remixes, (although I'm Your Baby Tonight is a different version from the one most of us have heard.) & I'm happy about that. But unlike most reviewers, I happen to enjoy dance music & the remixes on the throw down disc are all very good but they should have just release it as a totally separate collection all together.    That said, this is a wonderful greatest hits collection. Hopefully, Houston's upcoming album [[ASIN:B001AQTWF2 I Look to You]] will be a throwback to what made her a superstar & a true R&B diva.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This is regarding the Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller for PS3.  Let's start off with the fact that the controller works great.  It's got a slightly duller finish versus the original that came with my PS3, and it's lighter as well.  Light doesn't mean cheap though, as I've been using it for about 3 weeks straight with no ill effects.  There's only one caveat though, being that it didn't come with a mini-USB cable like the original controller did(shipped in the box).  Obviously I already had a cable, it's just that there was no mention of this on the Amazon page before I purchased it.  Other than that, I'm extremely satisfied.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|This movie starts off as a pretty disturbing film. First, if this would have been a 30 something man having sex with full nudity on film with a 15 year old girl it would be scandalous and seriously it probably would not even be made. But I guess we are suppose to forget that this German Mary Kay Laterno is a child molestor cause she can't read. But anyway, it is pretty much soft core porn for the first half of the movie. And keep in mind I have nothing against soft core porn. But then the story takes a turn and I am suppose to care that this totally vile piece of human scum had feeling and had been in love. I feel and felt no sympathy for her. She was a child molestor and she was a murdering scum.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Perfect present for a military veteran.   Got this as a present for my husband, and he still watches it over and over on his spare time.   I am not a war fan or a history enthusiast, neither am I fond of action-type movies, but I found myself pretty much hooked into watching it as well.
B00024I15U|2.0|This movie is close to my heart as I saw it many many years ago when I was a kid. It has a good cast and a pretty good story about a fascist coupe de ta. Franco Nero is really good and oozing charisma as the inspector who is investigating what is going on. Anthony Quinn is excellent as the old wise and dangerous mentor who Nero turns to. There is an African American actor who is miscast in a 70's/early 80's way for a little inside chuckle as a black operative with an Italian name (for some reason I am thinking it is the same guy that played the sheriff in Blazing Saddles). Also there is a torturer who has a go at Franco that is totally menacing and when Nero is filled full of drugs and tortured it makes this guy even more a monster.<br /><br />This movie does have some sentimental value to me which I said before. Even though that is the case I only rank it 2 stars. It is good but it is not a great movie and I think that unless you are a genre film buff or a fan of Franco Nero you probably will find the movie dated and not that good.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|When I saw this movie months ago, I though, It definitely will become one of my collection, but with the price of $39.99, Well I think, I have to wait longer before the price going down.  Just do not understand, why the studio have to release the pricey three discs + Digital copy version, A lot of buyers would be more than happy just to have the movie only disc without have to pay more.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This movie should have been good. But of course you have over acting king of crap Nicholas Cage and he is directed by slow mo dove guy John Woo. I like the idea of the movie. It should have been and could have been much better but it gets a one star from me cause the first time I watched it I thought it was awful. I have went back several times to give it another chance and it is just as bad. This movie sucked.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|From Superbad helmer Greg Mottola comes Adventureland, a coming of age saga disguised as a teen comedy, just like Superbad was before it.  And just like Superbad once again, Adventureland proves to be a better than expected film that is both heartfelt and plenty funny.  Jesse Eisenberg stars as James, a down on his luck college grad who gets shuffled off to Pittsburgh and stuck with a summer job at the amusement park from which the film gets its title.  He finds a kindred spirit in Em (Kristen Stewart), and finds himself well liked among his fellow co-workers, including his bosses (Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig) and other eccentrics (Ryan Reynolds and Martin Starr among others).  As time unfolds, James learns a few life lessons along the way; many of which he definitely doesn't see coming.  In between all of this drama however are some definite funny moments, and despite all the teen dramedy, Adventureland never comes off as pretentious or boring.  The cast is good and there's some great dialogue as well, with the end result being the film being something that is incredibly hard not to like.  All in all, Adventureland is something that is definitely worth your time, and once again like Superbad before it, is a different sort of teen comedy that those who don't like the typical teen comedy will actually manage to enjoy.
0307269981|2.0|This book, the second of Stieg's trilogy, is a great read with new complicated characters, a fast moving plot, and new insight into the inner workings of the Swedish police system. But everything leads to a climatic unbelievable ending scene that has almost turned me off this trilogy. I will however read the third book when it is released in the hope that it is more plausible.<br /><br />I admire Stieg's writing style and am impressed with the translation. However, he needed a better firearms information resource. Some of the pistol descriptions don't hang true (a minor point).<br /><br />Virg

Have been playing for over 20 years but let my theory knowledge rust and this book is already halping me get on track.    The author does a great job of logically sequencing the instruction to build upon a player's knowledge (no matter how minimal).    Keep in mind that this is a THEORY and KNOWLEDGE book, and not a how-to-play-like... you get the point - the application is up to you.    If you are theory / guitar-neck handicapped, definitely buy this book (and use it). Be patient - you'll get out of it what you put in.

0061122416|5.0|I read A LOT of books, and this is defiantly one of my favorites! It's simple and wonderfully complex at the same time, it doesn't embrace one point of view, it encompasses all perspectives on philosopy and religion, intermingling them into a beautifully orchestrated symphony of images. A definite must read! My newphew, age 14, enjoyed it just as much as I did. :)

B000002GLV|5.0|This album is unbelievable.  If you like John Mayall and jazz, blues, and rock n' roll you'll love this album.  It truly is a fusion of music genres and styles.  As harmonica player I love how he is able to interact with the saxophone and other instruments on this album and show how versatile a harmonica can be.  I imagine he had to change harmonicas if he is using a diatonic harmonica though I just got the CD and haven't had a chance to try playing along.
0307269981|3.0|2 1/2 stars, I think.<br /><br />I have to admit I had a difficult time with this book. It's BIG with over 500 pages, and I had trouble with some of the language even though it's been translated into English. I would have found it immensely helpful to have had both a list of characters in the front and a phonetic pronounciation of the names because I don't have a clue how I would pronounce the unusual vowel characters, in particular. I found the characters difficult to keep straight, especially since I haven't read any other books by this author, especially \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tatoo.\\" Aside from that, the different viewpoints and time changes were also hard to keep up with, and I agree about the \\"super human,\\" almost comic book-like, aspects of the story. With all that said, however, I still found the story interesting where I could follow it, and downright riveting toward the end.<br /><br />special notes:<br />There was a good bit of sex, a viscious rape although none is, in my recollection, played in a particularly graphic way. In addition, the book starts with a female child strapped to a bed and helpless while a male caregiver comes in, which may upset some readers; I don't have a particular feeling against helplessness, but I found it distinctly off-putting for a good while. It also has loads of violence, including a man set on fire. Cussing is pretty low though, as I recall.
B000ZN802W|4.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is an excellent film which was directed by Sean Penn.  It is based on a true story of a man, who after graduating from college, rejects the materialist lifestyle of his parents and heads out to the open road.  He ends up in the wilderness of Alaska.  I think anyone who has questioned his life with his parents, and haven't most of us, will be able to identify with this young man. It is amazing to follow him on his journey and the people he encounters on the road.  The cast is outstanding with great performers by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden as the man's parents. Emile Hirsch plays the real life Christopher McCandless, the hero of the film. Hal Holbrook stands out as a retired military man who was met on the road.  I would recommend the film just for the incredible shots of Alaska, which was actually another character in the film.  I find myself drawn to repeated viewing of this film and not many films do that for me.  If you would like a good adventure tale, I would recommend \\"Into the Wild\\".
0545128285|3.0|I am such a Harry Potter freak that I waited and was so excited for beetle the bard to come out. needless to say I was disappointed. I really think its great that JK Rowling is doing the Childrens thing that is really super. The book itself I have issue with. The length of the stories they really are a quick read.The stories themselves are so bad. I would never read them to my children because they are so dark. I can handle dark I read them Harry Potter all 7 books.These are not even good. It really leaves you wanting more. The artwork is worth the price of the book. I am sorry I was ever so excited it was not worth the wait

B001ED7C58|4.0|I loved the books and the movie so of course I bought the soundtrack when it came in. It was not what I expected even though I had seen the movie. I have to say though I like it. My favorites are Muse-Supermassive Black hole. The Black Ghosts-Full Moon. Linkin Park (of course my absolute fav)- leave out all the rest and Iron & Wine -Flightless bird.  Bella's lullaby got a lot of bad reviews but I do like it although its not what I had in my head when I was reading it. It has a nice tune to it.

B001IPILL6|5.0|This is just a beefy, brick of a knife.  The spine of the blade is about three times thicker (and weighs three times as much) than a typical hunting / survival knife and it feels virtually indestructible.  The tang runs through the entire handle (hard to tell from the pictures provided, but something I was wondering) and you can see it from the entire length of the edge of the handle.  It's a good length for both general purpose and survival situations.  Looked at several different knives and settled on this one.  No regrets....none at all.  I also like the sheath; it holds the knife with slight pressure from the sides so that the strap snap is not really necessary to keep the knife in place.  The sheath is not too bulky which is a complaint I have read of other products.
1416562605|4.0|For those of us who have never been to India, and probably never will, what do we know of the sub-continent? For myself India began with Rudyard Kipling, then EM Forster, Paul Scott and more lately Salman Rushdie.<br />In this book our hero is Balram Halwai who syles himself 'The White Tiger'. In a series of letters to Premier Wen Jiabo of China he sets out his life story. In doing so Aravind Adiga shows us another India, modern, vibrant and unsuspected. Its cultural divisions and its social chasms in sharp relief for the new century.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Not your typical low budget flick... because it ain't low budget, and the quality shows.  Numerous international locations, high action stunt work, and great special effects, take these well written movies and, with the help of an a-line cast, make these movies top notch.

B001OQCV2Y|5.0|Quentin Tarantino has always had a love affair with the medium of film, and he shows it once again in \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" which he has persisted in classifying as a spaghetti western disguised as a World War II historical epic. He's obviously much closer to this movie than I am, but I think it transcends genre altogether; it's not about the story so much as the craft, the meticulous attention to the many details that make a film a film. On the one hand, there's what we see physically presented on the screen--the carefully structured shots, the placement of character, the bold color scheme. On the other hand, there are the numerous cinematic references, not the least of which is title itself, taken from an Enzo Castellari film (both words spelled correctly, of course). There's also the fact that a movie theater plays prominently in the plot, as does celluloid. Even the casting of Eli Roth, himself a filmmaker, is none too subtle.    It would probably be enough for it to work at such a visual level, but Tarantino made an effort to include a thoroughly absorbing story that would be preposterous in the hands of any other director. But this isn't your grandfather's World War II film; this is a bold, raucous, cold-blooded tale of intrigue and vengeance in Nazi occupied France, where history will freely and joyfully be rewritten for the sake of entertainment. At the heart of this is the premiere of a German film depicting the exploits of a Nazi soldier. This premiere, which is held in a Paris movie theater, will see the attendance of Hermann Goering, Paul Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and most importantly, Adolf Hitler. The four most important German figures will be in the same place at the same time, which is just perfect for those who want to destroy the Nazi regime once and for all.    As it turns out, two assassination plots are unfolding. The first one involves the Basterds, a squad of eight Jewish-Americans led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine, a.k.a. Aldo the Apache (Brad Pitt), a hick from Maynardville, Tennessee with a very visible scar trailing across his throat. This man has one thing on his mind and one thing only: Revenge against the Nazis. It wouldn't be enough for him to want them all dead. He instructs his men to each collect 100 Nazi scalps as a souvenir. The few that are let go are forced to spread the word about who the Basterds are and what they plan to do. His right hand man is Staff Sergeant Donny Donowitz (Roth), who the Nazis have nicknamed The Bear Jew and fear might be a golem summoned by a rabbi. Imposing, loud, and mad as hell, Donowitz's trademark is beating Nazis to death with a wooden baseball bat.    The second plot involves a French-Jewish girl named Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent), the sole survivor of an attack back in 1941 who has been on the run ever since. Posing as Emmanuelle Mimieux, she operates a movie theater in Paris. One day, she's approached by a young German soldier named Frederick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), who finds her attractive. A war hero and an actor, Zoller convinces Goebbels (Sylvester Groth) to hold the premiere of a German propaganda film in Shosanna's theater.    I dare not reveal what Shosanna or the Basterds have planned, nor will I go into detail about the ending, which documents an event that never actually happened. For \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" World War II isn't a blueprint, but merely a backdrop for Tarantino to indulge in the lurid theatricality he's known for. One of the film's best qualities is the dialogue, so carefully worded and deliberately paced, able to build tension as effectively as anything visual. Tarantino hasn't always gotten dialogue to work, as was the case with \\"Death Proof,\\" the second half of the equally theatrical \\"Grindhouse.\\" Here, the words don't seem like unnecessary narrative pauses, but like a tool that works hand in hand with the way the film looks. The main antagonist, the cunning, witty, and deliciously evil Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), is given some the film's greatest moments of dialogue, probably because he's one of the film's best characters.    I can't bring myself to say that Tarantino is trying to make a statement with \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\" As has been the case before, the very lifeblood of this film is the art of filmmaking. It's a visual treat, certainly, but it's also meticulously worded, and this is in spite of the fact that the characters are exceptionally (and deliberately) broad. The exception to this, possibly, is Landa, who's cruel yet handles himself with the same air of dignity as a well-mannered boy trying to impress his elders. I don't think it's unreasonable or premature to predict that Waltz will receive an Oscar nomination for his performance. The film itself is a likely candidate for a Best Picture nomination, and for good reason: It's wild, rollicking film that doesn't care about history so much as pure entertainment.
B001FBSMF8|1.0|Chris Cornell is one of the most gifted singer song writers around. To me he is the best.  Chris's voice is the only stand out part of this CD. The generic canned music  is just \\"WAY\\" out of place, even just plain beneath his talent.  On the flip side, it would be like Britney Spears trying to sing/play guitar on Black Hole Sun.....It ain't gonna happen. If Chris wants to reach a larger audience then more power to him. I on the other hand I will never like canned drums, canned melodies, and the canned musical talent Timbaland regretfully brought to this effort.     Everyone has their own taste and I respect that. That being said, I would like to see Pepper Keenan produce Chris's next effort and Timberlake produce Black Label Society's next album. Timberlake needs to meet Zakk for a reality check. Everybody's hands in the air!
B001OQCV2Y|1.0|\\"Overrated\\" and \\"boring as hell.\\"  These are the words that kept coming to mind during the three hours of monotony that my friends recommended to me as \\"amazing.\\"  Either they were lying to me, they saw a different \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", or I'm the only one who can see that the emperor is naked.      I enjoyed the three previous Quentin Tarantino films I've seen, [[ASIN:1558908242 Pulp Fiction]], [[ASIN:B00008975Z Reservoir Dogs]], and [[ASIN:B000U9X1UM Grindhouse Presents Death Proof]].  Not much happens, but there's a certain theatricality to the way Tarantino's often-nonlinear stories unfold.    \\"Basterds\\" has all of the Tarantino trademarks: long stretches of mundane, but amusing, dialogue, larger than life characters, and occasional splatters of gore.  But in his previous films, Tarantino was able to pull all this off with more panache.  Every heavily-subtitled (most of the dialogue is either in German or French) scene drags its feet for what seems like forever, and only sometimes does the dialogue even approach being interesting.  The plot, little there is, is divided into episodic chapters like a 1940's \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  But this time, Tarantino exchanges depth for period detail, as if the historical significance of WWII will make up for all of the movie's shortcomings.  The Basterds of the title, a team of Jewish American soldiers infiltrating German-occupied France to take brutal revenge on Nazi soldiers, actually get only a small percentage of the screen time.  Most of the chapters focus on the film's German and French characters.     While Tarantino's previous efforts were made up of characters that started out resembling pulp creations and then grew in terms of complexity, all of the characters in \\"Basterds\\", both heroes and villains, are as flat as cardboard from beginning to end.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing if the film was an action movie like the trailers seemed to suggest.  But \\"Basterds\\" is completely dialogue and character driven.  90% of the movie is people having conversation while sitting at tables.      While \\"Pulp Fiction\\" featured a colorful cast led by Samuel L. Jackson (who lends his voice to \\"Basterds\\" as a narrator for a couple brief moments) and Bruce Willis, \\"Basterds\\" eschews stars for lesser known international character actors.  Not to say any of them are bad actors.  Christoph Waltz, Daniel Bruhl, and the haunting, enchanting Melanie Laurent are actually quite good.  But none of them are able to entertain for any reasonable amount of time with the flat characters and even flatter dialogue they are given to work with.  Diane Kruger ([[ASIN:B001UTZBOU National Treasure , National Treasure 2 Book of Secrets : Walt Disney 2 Pack Collection]]) is pushed to the background for most of her scenes.  Brad Pitt, effortlessly evoking a lazy Tennessee accent, is entertaining every minute he's on screen, but those minutes are actually few and far between.  The most entertaining performance actually comes from Mike Myers([[ASIN:B00006WUWQ Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery/The Spy Who Shagged Me/Goldmember]]!), in one scene in the middle of \\"Basterds\\", as a British General.    Perhaps the worst thing I can say about the movie is it actually had me rooting for the Nazis a few times, just because the Basterds were almost as loathsome.  In the end, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is more boring than any film about a plot to assassinate Hitler has a right to be and offers little to the cinema other than a title that rolls off the tongue nicely.
B000UGG39Q|5.0|These guys are really good. The five star reviews before me leave nothing much else to be said.  I really do miss COC and Peeper Keenan's voice.   BTW Peeper could you produce Chris Cornell's next album?
B00006IUL7|4.0|Insomnia is oftentimes engaging, sharply photographed, and nicely acted despite its genre conventions. It reminds one of the old film-noir movies, and even has a trace of Hitchcock in the subtle way most of the movie proceeds with its psychological-thriller concepts (the sense of quiet creepiness reminds one of Shadow of a Doubt.) Although the simplistic plot concerning a web of lies and murder wrecking psychological sleep deprivation on a homicide detective that is working to find a killer in a Alaskan town may not do much to advance this genre, the film is quite watchable. It is captivating formulism.     In part this is due to the film's leads (Al Pacino and Hilary Swank) that are played impeccably, and the real surprise of the main cast is Robin Williams. Giving a very understated and nuanced performance as the killer, Williams reminds one of the low-key villains that have a sense of soft-spoken eeriness to them and crooked logic that makes their manner oftentimes just as scary as a raving lunatic due to them feeling like your average, kind next door neighbors. The acting also complements the mood of the film, as well.    Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is shot much different than the dark shadows of those noir pictures. This film invokes its location of the 24-hour sunlight of Alaska with a lot of grays, blues, and well, sunlight. Nolan tells the story with both an atmospheric visual flair, and also shows considerable grasp at tension, even if the audience can guess what will happen. As Nolan may keep things rote, screenwriter Hillary Seitz and he also keep the elements rather grounded with both a sense of drama, apt monologues, and astute dialogue. There is even a quite nail-biting scene that has Pacino pursuing Williams on water logs, only for things to turn rather wet.    If Insomnia falters it is because the plot is only intricate in terms of the central dilemma, and not in terms of its development. Thematically, the elements are rather obvious in the morals that the film examines and at times it is also very Hollywood in regards to its stance on these beliefs. The film is almost too bittersweet in its logic, and since it ends on a moral note this also seems so obvious and predetermined that it comes without surprise or a sense of subversion; this is especially true in the climax.    In the end, Insomnia does nothing to reinvent the wheel, or even add anything to it. Rather, it just spins it well enough that it is both sincere and skilled enough about what it sets out to do. A fine watch, indeed.    8.0 / 10 (In 0.5 Increments.)

1594202249|3.0|I can't say I found many \\"thrills\\" in this story for it to be called a \\"thriller\\".  For me it was more of a funny snapshot in time of the late 60's and a comedy.  So much so I nearly thought I was stoned with all the grass the dopers were all smoking throughout the book.  Lottsa dopers here and everybody is toking up heavy duty every couple hours throughout the book.  For me \\"Inherent Vice\\" was more of a comedy than a suspense story with some grade B movie 60's sex thrown in to titilate the audience.  The rise and fall of the hippies and the now palpable fear of the Manson clan and the waning of th hopeful bright days of free-love are giving way to a darker and more sinister mindset for SoCal.  The story stars the amilable doper PI Doc Sportello who is nosing around the SoCal beaches and he keeps realizing that some things are just not adding up as he pursues some leads from his X-girl, Shasta.  Doubtless his intuition must be enhanced by all the weed he's smoking?  Nah. What can I say?  Stupid.  I found the story semi-entertaining and a story you got to be in the right mood for.  Many of his references to the Vietnam War and the moment in time are funny but this turkey just never gets off the ground no matter how hard it keeps flapping its wings.  I found it to be a erstatz cute little story sandwiched in between Doc's music of the moment complete with lyrics and Doc's near aimless blundering around stoned trying to solve a case in which Doc is in way over his head.  It was an Ok read but I wish I'd taken a Passadena instead.
B00003CXA2|4.0|Not literally. I for the most part have watched this movie in dribs and drabs as that's how much I can take of it. To be honest I really don't like it because unrequited love makes me sad. This is a sweet story about Forrest and his undying love of his friend Jenny. Forrest has a handicap in which he has to wear leg braces until the age of 9, and he's also slow mentally. Jenny is a poor girl who is molested by her single father until she's taken away from him. The roads that Jenny and Forrest end up taking are different as night and day. Jenny ends up in a world of drugs, sex, and rock and roll while Forrest now having shed his leg braces has gone onto college to play football, and enlist in the Marines, and goes to Veitnam, and becomes a successful entreprenuer, but still longs to have Jenny by his side, but circumstances keep pushing her away from him, and then Forrest does something that I wish I could do if I could afford to, and that's run back and forth across the United States. He runs to get rid of all the demons within him; meaning all the hurt, rejection, and anything that was bothering him. I know I'm carrying alot of baggage around within me, and I also have alot of responsibilities that I wish I could just run from, but I couldn't abandon my son, so I consider writing reviews on here as my way of running back and forth across the United States. I write about how movies, music, and books affect me, and hope that there's an understanding audience out there to know what I go through. I know some of it doesn't make sense, but I have to get my feelings out somehow.       Anyway after Forrest gets back from running back and forth across the United States he finally gets Jenny as she comes home to Forrest, and introduces him to his son, and Jenny has AIDS, so Forrest loving her still marries her, so he gets her in the end, but it's a short, but sweet marriage as she ends up dying. I know that my wife died, and I'm left to raise my son on my own, so that's another way this movie speaks to me. It's good, but I don't know if I will ever own it as I still don't like unrequited love, but I guess none of us do. I also feel that the line \\"Life is a box of chocolates...you never know what you'll get.\\" is overused here, and while there's probably a note of wisdom in this I just think it's lame. While it deserves the best picture Oscar I was pulling for \\"Pulp Fiction\\".
B0000CESR7|5.0|Riccardo Chailly is an excellent Bruckner conductor. Why? Because he understands the internal structure of the music and knows how to keep the ideas flowing, which is no easy task in Bruckner's music.<br /><br />The interpretations are solid and Chailly is able to bring out the emotional depths of this music perhaps not heard before. The only other Bruckner conductor I can compare him to is Gunter Wand, who in my opinion, is the greatest Bruckner conductor and is certainly my favorite. Jochum doesn't make my list nor does Karajan. Chailly knows how to build the climax and sustain emotional interest throughout this set. The Berlin Radio Symphony and Royal Concertgebouw play with guts, fire, and passion. They have what takes to bring Bruckner's ever-expansive musical vision to fruition. The audio quality of this set is also superb, which makes this cycle even more attractive.<br /><br />Anyone who likes Bruckner's music shouldn't be without Chailly's set. Outstanding playing from start to finish.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|This is definitely the second best album of 2006, with Number One being \\"A MAtter of Life and Death\\" by my favorite band, Iron Maiden! Muse are a great trio of great musicians, and this album truly showcases their talent well. Right from the sweeping intro of \\"Take a Bow\\", the album just explodes into pure rock, pure and simple. A mix of prog, synth rock, pop, metal, with a bit of spaghetti western, this album is one of my favorite albums of all time.<br /><br />TAKE A BOW: 10/10: An awesome song, begins quiet, then gets louder and louder, then BOOM! It explodes! It's a great Pink Floyd-ish way to open an album.<br /><br />STARLIGHT: 8/10: A beautiful song, Bellamy really shines on this song!<br /><br />SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE: 9/10: A bit of a naughty song lyric-wise, but a fun and catchy one too! Some good and subtle sexual puns in there (Glaciers Melting in the Dead Of Night, etc.)<br /><br />MAP OF THE PROBLEMATIQUE: 7/10: Didn't care for it at first, but now I like it a lot. Great use of it in the Children of Men trailer.<br /><br />SOLDIER'S POEM: 6/10: Meh, feels really filler.<br /><br />INVINCIBLE: 8/10: After a sort of bleh intro, it grows into a beautiful rocker with a real marching feel.<br /><br />ASSASSIN: 10+/10: HOLY FREEKING CRAP!!!!!! This song is so freekin' badass! After a creepy intro, the song explodes into a heavy, sledgehammer-assault track that is REALLY hard hitting. Best Muse song period! Makes you feel like you're going into battle.<br /><br />EXO-POLITICS: 5/10: Meh, again, kind of filler. Not bad tough.<br /><br />CITY OF DELUSION: 8/10: A real Spanish flavored track that really leaves you wanting more! Love it.<br /><br />HOODOO: 10/10: Wow, just freekin' wow. Beautiful song. Very slow, but it has an underlying tragic feel. May be the second best track on the CD!<br /><br />KNIGHTS OF CYDONIA: 10/10: A real Iron Maidenesque song with a galloping beat that is a hell of a way to go out.<br />In short, if you wanna get into Muse, buy this album. It's a great prog album, and because of this album I bought all their other albums. A must own!A must own!
1584282584|5.0|I pre-ordered this book for a natural light photographer friend who wanted to focus on learning her flash. When I received the book I cracked it open to make sure the gift I got my friend was a decent book. As it was a pre-order there weren't any reviews yet and all I had to go on as to the quality of the book was the author's blog. I had considered purchasing a different book for my friend and was willing to still get the other book instead of this one if this one didn't make the cut, but instead of purchasing the other book, I purchased ANOTHER copy of this book for myself. This book truly is a must have for someone wanting to expand their photography skills and actually use their flash to ENHANCE their images. The book is easy to read, not too long, and chock full of valuable information. Actually, I learned a lot about basic exposure from this book also. And I'm one who already photographs in manual. AND I got to put my new knowledge to use last weekend with my first indoor photoshoot. (I had the book in my camera bag in case I needed to reference it.) WOW! What a difference!  I can't recommend this book enough!!!

0307454541|2.0|The story combines a mystery, a David and Goliath story and an outcast savant story into a series of connected events in millennial Sweden. The local is not meant to be exotic, it is simply the country of the author. This fact is significant because many of the locations, names and media talked about are probably not common outside of Europe. Not a mark against the book but some thing to consider if your not from Europe and don't want to step out of your comfort zone. The murder story is a cold case murder 40 years before the book begins. The niece of a prominent family disappears. The patriarch of the family is obsessed with the disappearance for the whole time and in his twilight hires a financial reporter to investigate. The David and Goliath story is between the reporters magazine and the head of a wealthy securities group. The final story is the that of a social outcast with near super human abilities as a computer hackers and written communication but without the emotional skills needed to connect to other people, formal education or emotional support network. Unfortunately the characters are unbelievable, the dialogue is flat and the number of irrelevant facts that don't move the story forward is high. These combine to make the story mediocre. Where the story fails is that it contains an overt political agenda. The author's political messages (extreme leftist from a US perspective) get in the way of the story. Sometimes it is like read a left wing version of the Wall Street Journal Opinion page. Nice book but I think I am done after the first one.

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Brilliant film. The cinematography is awe inspiring. The extra features, particularly the behind the scenes look at the director in action was mesmerizing. I have a newly found respect for directors of that caliber.    If ever I want inspiration I just have to look at this film - brilliant aesthetically (image and sound track with original music, technically (the cinematography grabs me around the heart and won't let go) and the actors are superb; obviously a cast that knew how to work together under inspiring direction. I was blown away to find out that the dialogue involving the little girl was improvised and then scripted.
0756405890|2.0|I never really got into this book.  I took it with me on a 2 week road trip and it sucked up the water I spilled on it far better than it sucked up my attention. I finished it eventually but only after a few days of having nothing to do but read.    The story can be summed up as \\"The History of the Prodigal Hero from Age 5 to 15 (with the occasional interlude in the future to show you that you should care about him and that bad stuff is coming (just not in this book)).\\"  Nothing really exciting ever happens, the 'dragon' at the end is kinda lame by my standards, and bits are interesting but nothing suck you into the world OMG can't put down the book engaging.  The style reminds me a lot of Tad Williams's (Dragonbone Chair).  To me, Tad is the Master of \\"1000 pages of going nowhere\\" but he may have a challenger in Rothfuss.
B001AQR39O|5.0|Californication Season 2 was the best TV show of the year. The series is funny and sexy. The cast is terrific. The story is interesting. The dialogue --- between highly intelligent and wildly sexual characters --- veers between insightful and hysterical and is always entertaining. This is not a series for Puritans. This is a smart series for an audience who likes its sex sexy and its dialogue witty.
