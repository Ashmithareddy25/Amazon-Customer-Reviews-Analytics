B0042RUMEQ|5.0|You don't have to be a Barbie to enjoy this album; you just have to be a woman that has gone through trials and tribulation. Many people will complain and say that this album was too pop influenced for it to be worthy of the title of Rap and in a genre typically dominated by men they might have been right. In the past there were only two ways women survived in this arena: the first was to present themselves as masculine figures including baggy clothes and male influenced lyrics. The second was to become nearly naked erotic figures with raps about having sex and holding their men down. While only few managed to escape these molds, examples being Lauryn Hill and Missy Elliott, most have crashed, burned and faded into obscurity.    Onika Miraj does not fit into either of these categories and the world can now take a collective sigh of relief because female rap has its savior. The album has one center star: Nicki Minaj, but does not have one set sound. It is a charismatic compilation of each phase she has gone through since her mixtape era. I am convinced Roman's Revenge is the best rap song to be released in 2010 besides Love The Way You Lie; better still that it features an appearance by Eminem. Did It On `Em, is reminiscent of 2007's Nicki, containing the rawness that initially put her on the map. Right Thru Me and Your Love are already radio favorites but to get a true feel for the person who created this album you have to listen to the core section.    Dear Nicki, Save Me, Moment 4 Life, Blazin, Fly and Here I Am feature Nicki's unique singing voice, and are probably the most vulnerable songs she's ever strung together. Admittedly they are quite the detour from the hardcore persona usually featured in her guest appearances; a complete 180 from the beast that out-rapped Jay Z and took over Kanye West's `Monster' track. But if one listen's to the lyrics you'll find material that every woman can relate to: struggle, sadness, desperation, a need to survive, and a confidence that comes from finally accepting one's self.    The only true pop to be found on this album would be the Will.I.Am creation Check It Out and Last Chance both of which contain Katy Perry-ish beats and Nicki's usual swagger which might not seem like a perfect match to most but somehow works in this setting.    I feel that the people complaining most about this album are the men who don't feel comfortable blasting it in their car's and the so-call hip-hop puritans' whose livelihoods have been made from lyrics about drugs, sex, hoes, violence and money. This album instead chooses to branch out to reach numerous genre's rather than isolating itself to a constantly changing group that is never pleased. This album crosses over into Pop, R&B, Hip-Hop and just a touch of Techno, if you can't find at least one pleasing song on this album perhaps the issue isn't the music, it's you.
B000CNE092|4.0|Everything was great and as described on the info page. The extras are numerous and great, and the movie itself is perfect and not a knock-off (if anyone ever wonders). The only disappointing thing was that the cover art is not the same as the picture!! What you get isn't ugly but it's not as nice as shown.   Came promptly, I recommend purchase.
0007229674|5.0|I bought this book because it was so CHEAP and it said it was signed. But signed actually meant the front cover but who cares, for the price and the condition it was an excellent buy! Ramsay fans will love this.
B00129H7VS|5.0|One of my favorites, but $61.99?????  PLEASE lower the price, come on, like 40 35 0r 30 and I would but this in a second, but $60, that is WAY to much money, even for something as amazing as this show.

B003YWUTJI|2.0|Norah Jones is a interesting diverse artist who taps into different styles of music, however to me after her first album, she got boxed in and never got back again. when she first came out i was actually telling a friend who you wanna bet out of her and ALicia Keys who is stilll gonna count in the years to come? well Alicia Keys is still doing her thing. though her albums don't really move me like that, she is still the focal point of what she puts out. whereas Norah Jones is playing backup on her own Project with the kind of talent she has why would she resort to this so soon in her career?<br /><br />these tracks were cool and make good to show off to your friends at a Starbucks making it seem your playlist is diverse,however it feels empty and lacks feeling when you want the main artist to be featured more.<br /><br />i don't get her doing the Quincy Jones Route this soon in her career. she has a voice and a touch on the Keys.
B001US29I2|5.0|My son loves all of the Lego Star Wars toys.  It is a little advanced for a 6 year old, due to the complexity of building it.  I am an adult and it's kind of complicated for me to put together.  But if you have the time and instructions, it's a snap!
031603438X|2.0|back in the day the rolling stones were kinda interesting to me until after a while everything all started to sound the same. now as for Keith RIchards i wanted to see how he felt and what he thought about artists,etc.. and like so much else with him, he just comes off like  the sesame Street character \\"Oscar the Grouch\\"  DUDE  seems bitter and down right in the dumps. he and Mick Jagger are legendary with the Love/hate thing and how Keith til this day seems so insecure. He is a Good Guitar Player, nothing special to merit being in the same Sentence with the Likes  of a Jimi Hendrix, Chuck Berry, or Carlos Santana. the book touched on a few things about his childhood and career, however it feels devoid of any depth and he just comes across cranky, stubborn and stuck in a timewarp.<br /><br />for all the hype this book got it could have been told in one long interview in Rolling stone and called a day.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I just love the color and scenery in this movie and with it on Blu-ray it comes out even sharper. I watch this movie often. It's one of my favorites!
B0007TKNKG|4.0|My husband loved this movie when he was growing up. He was talking about it one day so I decided to buy it for him as a surprise. I knew that I would be able to find it at Amazon.com. I find just about everything at Amazon. It arrived very quickly and in great condition. We watched it as a family and had loads of fun. They don't make them like this one anymore!
B00005JLD4|3.0|After reading so many rave reviews of the film I was sure that I had a winner. I showed it to a human geography class and all I can say is we were rather disappointed in the drawn out, poorly acted, poorly scripted film. Moreover, the arc of the story wasn't too compelling. And the story wasn't there at all. The characters remained the same throughout, and it tried to portray real events with dissapointing inaccuracy. Peter Gabriel's scoring was a welcome surprise, however, with a sound reminiscent of The Last Temptation of Christ.<br /><br />On a technical level, I was surprised that the story failed to show in any way just what it was that motivated the whites to want to \\"civilize\\" the aborigines (forced marriages, the common unacceptance of half-whites in their communities, etc). I am not saying that cultural extermination/relocation is a good thing in any way, or that keeping folks apart on the basis of skin color is ethical at all, but one would get the impression from this film that the natives were doing just fine until the whites showed up destroyed their idyllic culture. That simply isn't true. Their culture left a great deal to be desired (especially from a modern, liberal perspective). The status of women, for example, wasn't at all shown for what it was.<br /><br />What is ironic is the girl who played Molly in the film ran away from the filming because she didn't want to do it anymore, and she was brought back repeatedly. She was also sent to a boarding school after the filming by the director! Lastly, when the real Molly Craig viewed this film, upon whom the film I supposedly based, she simply said, \\"This is not my story.\\"<br /><br />It's worth a viewing, but only as a piece of poorly scripted fiction.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|As always Maroon 5 does it right.  Complex song structure and sexy voices make it another favorite of mine :) For mature listeners do to subject content.
B0040HJNKC|4.0|Very good writing, playing, and a couple of great guest stars!! I listen to a lot of blues from many different artists and it is always great to \\"find\\" Buddy again delivering the goods.
B0045XICB2|3.0|I LOVED the first movie, the second one was ok but this one almost BLOWS. It does absolutely NO justice to the book. Eclipse is teeming with emotion and NO ONE in this movie shows even an ounce of believable emotion. I don't believe Bella's love for Edward OR Jacob. She acts completely STONED through the whole thing. The fight scenes are cool but nothing special and I liked that we got to know the rest of the Cullens a bit more, but other than that they just cut way too much out of the storyline for it to feel ANYTHING BUT choppy... and even major points in the book were nothing but a dead pan scene. I AM COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!!! If they don't do a better job on Breaking Dawn, then the movie idiots that wrote the script suck worse than newborn vampires. Gah! Hollywood ruins a great story AGAIN!!!!
B0000CJDAA|5.0|this is the most inspirational book you will ever read.  it is a fast read, covers a lot of ground ( 2 or 3 ) thousand miles, is exciting and ends well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If ever a book existed that appeals universally to all teens (or adults), I have just found it. Action, romance, violence, political commentary, societal/cultural critique, dystopia, tragedy...it's all here. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|First off, I applaud Amazon getting this to me today, the day it came out. Impressive. I would have had to drive 45 minutes to buy this since the local movie place didn't have the 2 disc edition. I love the deleted & extended scenes. They are worth buying the movie for. I wish there was more, but there was enough to justify the 2 disc copy.
B0033B5XCS|4.0|I bought the collection for $17 great price but the only movies I liked were the first freddy and Freddy vs Jason awesome the others ones sucked. Still if you are a horror fan like me you should own the this horror collection.
B0007Z4S4C|2.0|Was underwhelmed by the seller's use of full CD art and noting in small print below that it was disc only.    Thanks very little.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|Beautiful scenery great plot. The actors are great. I watch it again and again. Wes Craven can do no wrong except some of his Nightmare on Elm Street are crap.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Joystick moves slow really and the joystick triggers are poor but the price is right but joystick isn't quality at all
0810994739|5.0|My son is 12, and he LOVES the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.  He's been reading them for YEARS, and each time he reads any of them, it's like a brand new book!
B00005JLIU|1.0|We purchased this DVD thinking it would be fun family entertainment, something along the lines of The Music Man or South Pacific. It didn't appeal to any of us. It really didn't grab our interest, and the songs weren't even familiar.
143350393X|5.0|I only recently discovered the ESV translation, and fell in love with it. I had been looking for a Bible in modern English that captured the poetics of scripture, and this was it. When I learned of the ESV Study Bible, it was a must have. There is so much detail within the pages. And one thing I like, is that I haven't noticed any slant towards one theology or the other. For example, in the study notes on 1 Corinthians 12, concerning the spiritual gifts, the notes neither take the continuist or cessationist approach...they explain both views and leave it open to the reader, which is how a good study Bible should be. I recommend this Bible to anyone, it's a great resource to have at your disposal.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Everyone knows how good eclipse is, so I am only writing the review for the extras that come on the second dvd. I liked the deleted and extended scenes. Too bad that werent in the actual movie. But the 6 part making of documentary is really great. If you like to know how things are made, and also see some funny extras like Taylor Lautner catching grapes in his mouth from 30 feet away then this is the dvd to get : )
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Dorian Gray is a young man of pure beauty.  He befriends an artist named Basil, and at first Basil uses Dorian as a model for paintings, putting him into classical scenes.  Eventually, however, he decides to paint a portrait of Dorian as he truly is.  Around the same time, Dorian befriends one of Basil's acquaintances, Henry, and Henry makes Dorian more cynical and jaded.  When Dorian finally sees the portrait Basil has painted, he weeps and wishes that he would remain young, and the portrait would age in his place.  When his wish comes true, Dorian will go to murderous lengths to keep the secret.<br /><br />Sometimes, a girl just needs a little bit of the classics in her life.  Thank goodness Amazon offers a wide variety of public domain books available for free Kindle download.  This was my first foray into Wilde, and I wonder how different of an experience reading his work in his own time would have been.  To me, the homoerotic undertones leap from the page, but I wonder how much of that was intentional on his part, and how much of that is me being influenced by what we know of Wilde himself.  Regardless, there is something sensually sinister about the interactions of the men in this book.  And while most of them do have relations with women, very few seem to value or enjoy female interactions at all.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this dark, cautionary tale of a wanna be Narcissus.  It did take me a while to get into the pacing of the more classical language and writing style, having been reading a lot more modern books lately, but once I was about a third of the way through the book I literally devoured it.  I know Wilde did not write as prolifically as some classical writers, but I believe I will be seeking out some of his other works.<br /><br />I could not help but feel some pity for Dorian Gray.  He became exactly what everyone groomed him to be, then everyone scorned him for being what they had wanted him to be in the first place.  Someone needs to get this book to Lindsay Lohan as soon as possible, she may find it familiar. Which make me wonder, with all the modernizations and mash ups of classic literature out there, why hasn't anyone done anything with this story?  It seems to me that it could be redone with a modern twist, or vampires or something really well if the right person did it.  Of course, if the wrong person did it, it would be wretched, so maybe it is best left alone.as soon as possible, she may find it familiar.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|We have not had time to watch the DVd of the Pacific.  We're waiting till things slow down after the holidays.  We have heard from many that it's a great series and we deliberately waited until we could purchase it and did not watch it on TV.  We also bought a second set to give as a Christmas gift.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is one of the most beautifully written YA stories that I have ever read. Every now and then I come across a book that isn't paranormal but is just so phenomenal that I have to mention it.    The story of Anna and Etienne is so natural. They develop an amazing friendship and begin to see what they can be together despite all the obstacles in their way. As in typical teen life there are many obstacles and as a reader you aren't sure which way it will go for the two of them.     Anna is a brilliant female lead. She is funny, smart, strong but still vulnerable. She cries but it makes her more human and relatable. She has problems but never comes off as whiny. Her character made me love this book. The supporting characters are also incredible but Anna will keep you reading this book.    Etienne is a great male lead. The whole story you are waiting for the two of them to figure out what is between them. Stephanie does a great job of making you feel the ache they both feel without making the book seem like it is full of angst.     I really could go on about this book for pages. I absolutely loved it. If you like the happier Sarah Dessen work then this is a book for you. If you typically read the paranormal stuff, take a break and check this book out. I give it a 6/5.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|It was postwar America.  Frank Capra, a legend in his own time, read a short story entitled \\"The Greatest Gift\\" by Phillip Van Doren Stern. With his team he wrote a screenplay based on the story, and It's A Wonderful Life was born.    There was a great deal of excitement on December 20, 1946 as the finished film premiered at New York's Globe Theatre. Reviews were mixed.  Perhaps it was because of the postwar mentality.     Audiences did not embrace it in the winter of 1947.  It did not break even at the box office. A fantasy film with so much wholesomeness was a bit hard to swallow after years of war with wounds still so fresh.    It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards (Best Actor, Best Film, Best Director, Best Editing and Best Sound).  The postwar drama, The Best Years of Our Lives, would take all the awards and all the praise as well as being the top grossing film.   Frank Capra did receive the Golden Globe for director.    As things tend to be over time, It's A Wonderful Life found a new audience and new generations on television in the 70's and 80's, even though the film copies were poor and edited badly.      Now in its restored version, it is viewed as the holiday favorite in December.  NBC has exclusive rights for its showing.    This 2 Disc DVD has a colorized version as well as the pristine black/white. The black and white version gives a vivid life to the characters and Bedford Falls.  There is a nice tribute to Frank Capra in this set.     It is a story of hope, love, redemption, and simple goodness.      If you had to choose as a neighbor and friend George Bailey or Henry Potter, who would be your choice? I think we all know people like Bailey and Potter. Of course, we all know a place like Bedford Falls.    I hope this brief history of the film has been of value to you.  I did not see the point in repeating what had been written about the characters and story.    Happy holidays!
0767802489|5.0|This is REAL warfare.Submariners experienced day after day of mind numbing drudgery followed by the thrill of the hunt and finally the terror of being the hunted.Imagine being hundreds of feet below the surface unable to see your pursuer knowing that death could come in an instant.And make no mistake death was a certainty to those crews whose boats were struck by allied depth charges or hedgehogs.I could not agree with your post more.These types of movies are not meant to be entertaining in any way shape or form.Rather, they offer those  curious few of us a brief glimpse into the lives and experiences of the men who fought in World War II. As for the viewers who rated this movie poorly may I suggest they stick with such epic and historically accurate films as U-571.<br />DUDENKOPFS!!!!!!!!!!!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I bought this watch in late August.  It started out great.  Battery life was good, it found Satellites fast, I really loved it.    But now it is a little over 3 months later.  The battery only lasts a couple of days, (there is no way to turn this thing completely off) and it takes forever (sometimes as long as 5 minutes) to find satellites.    I'm guessing there is something wrong with the acquisition and so it burns up the battery trying to acquire satellites.  I do turn the GPS off when I store it but that doesn't seem to fix the battery life problem.    I have tried contacting Garmin but if you call you will be on hold for 45 minutes before you give up.  I'm on my second e-mail and still waiting for a reply.  Hopefully I will hear something soon and will update this with my progress if I get any.    UPDATE 12/11/2010: I received an e-mail from Garmin about performing a soft reset and also a reset to factory defaults.  You must upload your data before performing either one if you want to keep it.  The soft reset did not fix my satellite problem.  The hard reset did.  For both resets you hold both buttons on the side down until the unit powers off.  For the hard reset, release the start button (the top one) while continuing to hold the lap button (the bottom one) after the power off until a pop-up menu appears.  At that point you release the lap button and click the start button to reset to factory defaults.    UPDATE 1/16/2011: After performing the resets recommended by Garmin, I haven't had a single problem.  I'm upgrading my 3 stars to 4 stars - knocking 1 star off because of the issue.  But other than that it has been working great and as advertised.
6304711905|5.0|Ah, the rare five star. This one deserves it. Infinitely better than the film \\"Wyatt Earp,\\" Tombstone is one I've seen twice and enjoyed more the second time. Kurt Russell is great- the story is has both depth and action- it seems reasonably historically accurate from what I've read- but NOTHING about the film tops one thing- Val Kilmer's performance as \\"Doc\\" Holliday. As good as Hopkins was playing Lecter; that's how good Kilmer is. It's one of the best jobs of ANYONE's acting career. You'll watch in awe.
B001974DG0|5.0|I recieved this book when I was much younger, and it grabbed me and held on. It made me laugh, made me cry (all the good things a well written book should do, make you CARE for the characters).  The only warning I have...STAY AWAY FROM THE MOVIE and just stick with the book :)
B001L84QV4|4.0|1977's \\"Ocean\\" remains a mystery to me.  Given it's a concept album featuring a set of four extended space rock jams, by all tokens I should hate this album with a passion.  While it isn't something I'd want to hear everyday, I have to admit that the results have kind of an interesting edge that's slowly grown on me over the years.  Largely written by drummer Jürgen Rosenthal, the concept certainly wasn't the most original thing you've ever heard, an allegorical plotline mixing the rise and fall of Atlantis with bits of Greek mythology thrown in (words to the wise, don't piss off the Greek Gods ...) and a nod of caution to current times.  While the results weren't perfect, it held together better than most everything in The Pink Floyd catalog and for some reason Boremann's heavily accented vocals weren't really much of a distraction.  I'd even argue the occasionally clumsy English lyrics (\\"guardman of justice offering help favorite victim of your self-made gods\\") actually added an element of fun into what could have been a pretentious and plodding effort.  Back to Pink Floyd for a moment ...  Among the dozens and dozens of online reviews of this one, quite a few compare these guys to Floyd; even accusing them of being little more than a copy band.  I'd suggest you simply discount those comments and accusations.  Sure there are some Floyd influences in these grooves, but they have their own unique sound without being imitative.    - The first half of 'Poseidon's Creation' was an atmospheric instrumental that served to showcase the band's technical competency.  Guitarist Frank Bornemann, bassist Klaus-Peter Matziol, keyboardist Detlev Schmidtchen, and particularly drummer Rosenthal all got a shot at the spotlight with impressive results.  As mentioned earlier, Bornemann's vocals were heavily accented, but with a little effort you could figure out what was going on and the band's harmony vocals were surprisingly sweet.   rating: *** stars   - Initially spotlighting Schmidtchen's synthesizers, 'Incarnation of Logos' was a far starker and more ominous composition.  The spoken word backing vocals (\\"primary procreation is accomplished ...\\"  always make me smile.  After droning on for about five minutes the track unexpectedly picked up some speed and energy with Matziol contributing a killer bass line.    rating: *** stars   - 'Decay of Logos' seemed intended as little more than an opportunity for each member to showcase their technical skills - Bornemann won this one turning in a killer lead guitar solo.  Oh, this was the part of the narrative where mankind basically shows off what a bunch of losers we are, in the process pissing off the Greek Gods.  Remember what I said earlier?  Don't piss off the Greek Gods ...    rating: *** stars   - And then you come to 'Atlantis' Agony of June 5th - 8498, 13 p.m. Gregorian Earthtime' ...  This extended epic saw Bornemann and company seemingly discarding most of the elements that made the first side so appealing.  Okay, okay, maybe that was a bit on the harsh side ...   The track opened up with an over-the-top spoken word segment and then plunged into an extended instrumental section which displayed more than a little Kraftwerk influence, including tons of Schmidtchen doodling synthesizers ...  great background music to slap on your sound system while vacuuming the living room.   Luckily the band regained their sense of melody towards the end of the track and Rosenthal turned in some astounding drums, even if they sounded like they were being played from the bottom of the ocean (which may have been the intent given Atlantis' final resting place).  rating: *** stars     Commercially this one saw the band hit the big time throughout Germany and parts of Europe, though once again they couldn't get arrested in the States.     \\"Ocean\\" track listing:  (side 1)  1.)

B0042MEQVG|5.0|My husband was out first thing this morning to get the DVD. I saw this in the theater and had to have it for my collection. I thought the big screen translated well onto my TV. If you love the series , you need to have this DVD.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|Now understand, I LOVE the movie. I am so excited to watch it, but I hate that they put the blu ray disc on ONE side and the DVD disc on the other side. So it's one disc but with two versions. Money grubbers is all I have to say about that. I paid about 30 dollars in stores for this ON SALE and they give me one freaking disc! That's not right, I've paid less for a blu ray disc, dvd disc, and a digital copy disc of other movies. I mean heck, Fantasia set was less than that and you got 2 movies - 2 on blu ray and 2 on dvd. I know that Twilight is a high profile movie and that's why they chose this one because they knew people would still buy it. But if I had known that I would have just bought the blu ray only version and saved myself some money.     All in all I LOVE the movie and hate the production companies.
B0031OCY2E|1.0|This movie was terribly slow.  There was an attempt at humor.  An attempt, which seemed to work in the first 10 minutes, however, after 10 minutes of Damon saying quirky little things, one wants the plot to move along.  I felt that this movie could have been good if they had tried to focus more on the twisted and warped mind of the lead character rather than trying to make Damon a comic.  This movie fell very flat.  By the end, I just wanted the movie to end and to have some resolution - it didn't matter what that was.  I just wanted the movie to end!  It was almost like they were trying to make a movie like Fargo, but didn't even come close.  Do yourself a favor and save the two hours of your life that you can never get back!
B000W74EQC|5.0|I first saw this film when I was but 7 years old. Since then, I have watched the film many times, particularly during the last few years. Now I am 12, and still love it. I would rate this film 5 out of 5 stars. Since I (and know many people who agree with me) find there's nothing more irritating than a review that says, \\"I love this item!\\" without saying why, I'll try to explain why I would rate Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone 5 stars. One reason (and a strong one, in my opinion) is the acting. I think they chose the perfect actors for the roles. For instance, Harry on screen looks exactly like I thought he would in the book. He also sounds like him exactly and says lines that are word for word from the book. I just think he's extremely ... Harry like. Hermione is first shown as a bossy know-it-all. Everyone I've met who's seen the film agrees that it's exactly like the book counterpart, but through perfect acting that doesn't grow stiff, we're shown that Hermione has a kinder, less bossy side to her. Ron and the whole Weasley family just \\"seem\\" like the Weasleys, for the same reasons I gave for Hermione and Harry. I don't know anyone who disagrees when I say that Snape was flawlessly cast and acted. The same is true for everyone else in the film. It all just feels very Harry Potter like. Another reason was that the film was extremely faithful to the book. It didn't try to improve on the book or have a completely different feel to it, therefore making it a much better film for that. It treated the book with respect. Another reason I can think of that this film merits 5 stars is that the film never drags. There is not a single moment that is too long in the film, in my opinion. For instance, how many people would guess that the Quidditch match in the middle of the film was 8 minutes long? Also, the whole 40 minutes until Harry gets to Hogwarts are fast but don't leave out anything. Once Harry's at Hogwarts, we spend our time taking in all the events that happen, making it seem like 10 minutes long instead of 150 minutes. Finally, the visuals are stunning. The castle looked exactly like Hogwarts was described in the book. The Forbidden Forest was menacing. The Hogwarts Express looked like a very comfortable train to be in. The ending is stupendous, as well, and very satisfying. Who doesn't cheer when Dumbledore awards the points taken away from Harry, Ron, and Hermione and even gives some to Neville. Those are some of the reasons why I think Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone earns its 5-star rating from me.
B004AQR29C|4.0|I've been reading some of the reviews from this movie and I must say that I cannot believe some of them.  I liked the movie simply because of the action.  Now, with that said, I was a skeptic at first.  But when I came to my senses, I felt, with all these folks in the movie, some has beens, why expect this to be Oscar-worthy?  Trust me, the plot of the movie has been done 10 times over, but so what.  Enjoy the movie for the action scenes, the one-liners, and most of all, the NOISE.  If you have a descent Home Theatre System, put it to work.  Specifically when Terry Crews uses his (I heard it called)\\"BOOP\\" gun.  You'll have to cover your ears, trust me.  If you expect anything other than lots of testosterone, muscles, some funny and not-so funny one-liners, don't watch this movie.  I don't think the intent was to have award-winning performances here just some muscle bound mercenaries that can keep you entertained for an hour and 43 minutes.  Let's not be so stiff on this movie people.  Your fault for expecting more.  :-)
B00005UEAR|1.0|As a big fan of Progressive Rock or \\"Art Rock,\\" whatever you want to call the subgenre of rock n roll that makes people think of Rush, Genesis, Tool, ELP, King Crimson, Yes, Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, etc, I was told by some friends of mine that this was the album for me that would be perfect for my growing music collection. Nothing could have been further from the truth. I could not have been more disappointed. Disc 1, while heavy is quite pretentious especially the opening sone \\"Glass Prison\\"; here we have just a bunch of solos strung together in between the opening and closing singing parts. It would have been better if the each solo were part of a different song. The Great Debate is annoying because of the news recordings that take away from the music because they are way too intrusive; also, the song is way too preachy. The other three songs vocally make me think of a heavy Dennis DeYoung but more annoying. Overall, Disc One sounds as if Styx had a grandchild with Emerson Lake and Palmer. While I like the latter, the combo is unlistenable (if that's a word). Disc Two is even worse: the opening overture sounds like Chritsmas music!!! It sounds like the Trans Siberian Orchestra not like Rock music at all. Moments of War Inside My Head and The Test That Stumped Them All are tolerable but not in their entirety. The Grand Finale is anti-climactic and boring. In all honesty, I'd rather listen to Jethro Tull and Styx and for the most part I really don't care for these either but they are much better in comparison. It is so bad, I immediately, after listening to each disc twice, took it out of I-tunes and placed the CD in a shoebox in my closet so it will not be near my CD collection at all--it doesn't deserve to hold a place there. It is that bad!!!

B0012GMW0C|5.0|Journey's first album.  This brings back fond memories of the mid-70s. Never thought I'd miss those times, but I do. \\"Kahotek\\" was the first song I heard from this Journey period, and was the reason I bought the vinyl album way back then.
B003VS0CWO|4.0|Great.  Just as I remembered it.  Oh wait, it's the same film!  Anyway, it was great to see it in blu-ray and re-live the 70's again.
B0016A2FFG|4.0|For a brother that thought \\"Simply Beautiful\\" was the epitomy of soul vibes, this album reminds me Al Green never lost a step. His voice has 45 years training and still sounds as fresh.   then again  Why shouldn't he sound the way he did in '72? Voice and delivery haven't lost a step      Seriously. This new/old Al Green sound blows my mind!
0307454541|5.0|This is one of those books that I tried to get into several times before it captured me.  EVERYONE was reading it and raving about it but I had trouble with the first hundred pages.  I decided that I'd stick to it and just continue past page one hundred no matter what.  And am I ever glad that I did.  This is an amazing book, a book that is psychological thriller, mystery, and a deep look into the human predicament.  It is wonderfully written by Stieg Larsson and translated by Reg Keeland.  I think that most readers know that these books became international best sellers posthumously and that Larsson never lived to see the fruits of his labor appreciated.<br /><br />The novel starts off with an investigative reporter in Sweden, Mikael Blomkvist, found guilty of slander and facing a libel conviction with jail time.  He wrote about a financier named Hans-Erik Wennerstrom and did not back up his sources.  Blomkvist is co-editor of a liberal magazine with his long-time lover, Erica.  While he is awaiting his jail time, a rich businessman named Henrik Vanger contacts him and asks Mikael to look into the death of his niece, Harriet, thirty-six years ago.  The Vanger family is a very strange lot and Henrik is fairly certain that one of his own family is Harriet's murderer.<br /><br />There is another story line, and that is about Lisbeth Salander, a strange and aloof woman with a dragon tattoo and many secrets in her past..  She works for a high level investigative firm and is one of the best investigators and computer hackers in the world.  She has been hired by Henrik Vanger's lawyer to check  out Mikael Blomkvist.  Once this task is complete, the two of them get together and work on finding Harriet's  murderer - that is if she has even been murdered.  There are those that think she may have just disappeared.<br /><br />The beauty of this book lies in its wonderful writing, plot development and characterization.  The characters are quirky, quite individualistic, and accepted for who they are.  Maybe this is because the sub-arctic climate of Sweden is open to differences, much as Alaska (where I live) is.  As the book progresses, the plot thickens and thickens.  It is always fascinating and it held my interest throughout its 590 pages.  I look forward to reading the sequel, 'The Girl Who Played with Fire'.Maybe this is because the sub-arctic climate of Sweden is open to differences, much as Alaska (where I live) is.

B003YOZNBU|2.0|In the early 70s, having read my share of Kid Colt and the Rawhide Kid, Jonah Hex featuring in Weird Western Tales for the first time was an amazing character ! The screenplay for the Comics showed some really caustic but witty back and forth between Jonah and the numerous devious devils he slayed. His dog getting shot and dyeing after freeing him from the Confeds local army still rings an emotional chord when i reminesce. Regrettably, Jonah Hex the movie has not been able to capture any of such moments and has remained a poor revenge story with the character Jonah not being threshed out at all. I still love the Comic Character and wish could say the same for the movie...alas
0739367676|3.0|I bought the audio book instead but it is unabridged so is the entire book.  I was nice in deciding to give it 3 stars. (I almost feel dishonest in giving it 3 stars instead of maybe 1 or 2 but because I love the series, I tried to be a little overly nice)!!!  I have to agree with the others that this book is very poorly written and subject matter is not proportional to the importance of it in many areas in my opinion.  I mean she seems to talk endlessly on mundane parts that do NOT need that much detail and very little time on what many would like more detail on.  Most females want to hear more about the wedding dress, the wedding, the first time Edward and Bella together, etc, etc. If my tape would have had a skip in it, I would not have even known they slept together almost.  Stephanie seems to spend endless amounts of time talking about Jacob and other such things and less about what probably most of the fan base wants to hear about, which is probably more mostly girls.  I know if you are a Jacob fan you will want to hear about him but he is not the important one in this movie and his area tends to be endless from the audio tape.  Again, she gets in to these endless details on other things that I think are not all that interesting and then spends little time on the other things I spoke about, which to me is what this book is supposed to be about.  I can already tell from the pictures and clips floating around out there that the movie will be much much better then the book.  The same holds true for Eclipse.  Stephanie Meyer has this obsession about wanting to leaving out some of the most interesting parts of the movie when you listen to her commentary on the Eclipse DVD.  Luckily, she was overridden or ignored on some parts.  She obviously has no clue as to what fans going to see the movies want to see.  She wanted that scene not to be there in Eclipse where Edward gets mad about Jacob kissing Bella the first time without her permission and she slugs him.  Stephanie did not want Edward to be mad and did not want the scene to come off that way but she even admitted all the viewers wanted it and loved it and thought he should be mad.  Thank God that they make the movies better despite her.
B003YK42LQ|5.0|The earlier stuff was brilliant, but this is just as good and more accessible. My favorite tracks are Pyro, The Face, Mi Amigo, and Pickup Truck, but every song is excellent and the album is best listened to as a whole. I believe the core genius of the band is in the song writing. All you have to do is listen to some of the many covers of their songs on Youtube to realize that the melodies are so strong almost anyone can make a decent version.    Highly recommended!
B0043KK4N6|4.0|As a music compilation, this CD is outstanding.  The quality of the arrangements and the voices of CA and Cher are awesome.  Cher can be described with superlatives with the Diane Warren song \\"You haven´t seen the last of me\\".    The only aspect i didn´t like is that 20% of the themes are sung by Cher and the rest by Aguilera.  I would have enjoyed this more if the tracks were more evenly on both of them.    Overall, great buy.
B000002LGA|5.0|This became one of my favorite albums ever, after only 1 or 2 plays!  The band and the sound are awesome.Great lyrics and delivery.  Still sounds fresh even after 20+ years!  For more N.Y. rock n roll check out the Five Points Band...
B002ZG99A4|2.0|I am a fan of the classic 80's action films with Arnold and Stallone and was hoping with all the action stars in this one that it would be the best action movie ever. I was wrong.    The past decade or so has not been kind to the action genre of films. There is no big name star these days that when you see his name in the credits, you know what you'll be getting. The emergence of quick cuts and shaky cams has destroyed the fine choreography of martial arts masters like Jet Li. CGI just can't compete with well done special effects. I yearn for the old days of action movies. So I was hoping this movie would harken back to the days of old and bring back the classic action movie feel. Unfortunately, it uses plenty of the aforementioned quick cuts, shaky cam, and CGI to the point where the potentially great fight sequences are pretty much wasted and incomprehensible. I know in a movie like this, one should ignore the plot since there tends to be none, but it felt like they tried to make a big story out of this. About 2/3's of the way through, I'm thinking to myself, this movie has no action in it. It did pick up in the final third but with the aforementioned 'modern' styling. I could not get past the slow pacing and the lackluster action sequences. Though one particular weapon, almost, salvages it.    Video wise on the Blu-ray, it's passable. Nothing reference quality, but not so bad it was terrible transfer. It does a serviceable job. ON the audio side, it's pretty good. Plenty of bass to rattle the walls with a good subwoofer. The dialog between scenes is manageable, if a little on the muted side. Haven't gotten into the supplements, but with my dislike of the film, I'll have a hard time trying to enjoy them.    Overall, I really was hoping for more from this film, perhaps too much. HOwerver, in the end, it just doesn't deliver. I'd rent this one before buying it. 2 stars.
1439181780|4.0|After having read numerous books on the Law of Attraction, I was very pleasantly surprised with the depth and clarity in The Power.  I thought 'The Secret' was an intriguing--but incomplete and lacking in how-to--introduction, and found Esther Hicks' books to provide the most thorough teaching on the subject.  The Power, however, surprised me by filling in the blanks pretty well for many readers, and it contains teachings that can shed light where the original didn't (while still maintaining the mass appeal of 'The Secret').<br /><br />Like 'The Secret' (but not to the same degree), The Power is over-simplified in some ways, and is written in language that's easy for the masses to understand (depending where you're coming from, this could be seen as a positive or a negative).  I particularly think her general advice of \\"good feelings are good, bad feelings are bad\\" (not an exact quote) is a little misleading, and prefer Abraham-Hicks' approach to feel better from wherever you are--which, if you're coming from a place of feeling depressed, could mean feeling vengeful (meaning \\"negative\\" emotions can serve a very positive purpose).  To me, Hicks' approach is more applicable and genuine, whereas Bryne's \\"feel good feelings, avoid bad feelings\\" could lead someone to try to force feeling great, rather than taking steps to really feel better.<br /><br />All in all, though, this is an excellent extension of the ideas in The Secret: just know that you may be able to learn more elsewhere.
1400052173|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's not too heavy factually and the emotional/human element adds a dimension that is missing in many scientific non-fiction books. I found it to be informative, entertaining and most definitely page-turning.    In addition to understanding how medicine has changed in the last 50 years, the book provides an interesting insight into racist inequality in the US mid 20th century.    Well worth a read.
0385340540|5.0|I loved this book.  Having an Italian heritage made it especially entertaining.  I read all of Grisham's books and this one is my absolute favorite.  I love the suspense and the humor and the attention to detail that marks all of Grisham's books.  The book starts out with the broker getting a last hour pardon from the president who has just hours left before his term is up.  The broker is then brought to Italy, given a new name, and left to learn the language and navigate as a genuine Italian so that he doesn't get killed. I found myself empathizing with the broker and his struggle to learn both the culture and the language.  I loved the ending also--all the loose ends tied together so nicely in a twist of events ofcourse.  Once you get into this book you won't want to put it down.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I almost didn't buy this game.  Reviews sounded good, but I didn't like the price.  I almost missed out.  I would have paid double for this game.  Highly addicitive, great puzzles, captivating story - I literally couldn't put it down.  I have completed 4 of the 6 endings and will be going back to hit the other 2 soon!  Definitely for mature audiences.  Lots of reading, but it is very interesting.  If you like suspense, novels, and puzzles, then this game is perfect for you!
B00321LFZ8|1.0|The Video was what you would expect for a HD TV program, but the audio kept phasing in and out, as if from stereo to mono, which is totally unacceptable for a show that depends on delicate sounds and music scores.  It was completely distracting and disappointing.
B00428CPUY|3.0|Despatched a month ago and still hasn't arrived. There's no options for chasing international freight. If it ever arrives, I'm sure it'd be great.
0316044695|5.0|An amazing story of a true American hero and a tail of survival. Very well written and impossible to put down.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Im not going to lie im older than the preteen set that these types of books are designed for, but that dosnt stop me from totally loving them. Great story that keeps you interested from the very begining and manages to keep the same momentum through the whole book. Its a great tie in to the Percy Jackson series even though after you read it you know that it is a new series totally able to stand on its own merrits. Read it, love it, Die waiting for the next one to come out
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is great if you like to be \\"in\\" the game. This is different then the last controller in which it has rumble and is a little bit heavier. The heavier sensation actually makes this controller good because you get to be in on the action and actually know what you are pressing. The con of this product is that if you leave it out dust will get into the holes in the controller, well not really holes but like cracks. This is actually a good product, its just that it gets dirty quickly. Overall, this is a much better controller then the first one. I would recommend buying it for a better playstation 3 experience!
B000T0XEGS|5.0|I had a VCR of this performance, but it degraded over the years, and I have been looking for a DVD for a few years, but they, when available, were grossly overpriced.  I was overjoyed when I found this one at a very good price; I was a little concerned because this dealer is from England, and I think some DVDs are coded to only play in certain parts of the world, and I couldn't find any mention of that.    When it came I noted it is coded for worldwide use, and it was in perfect shape.  It arrived far before the promised date.    Some purists criticize this performance for some omissions and for being a film, but it is my experience that directors very often omit scenes from operas.  If such artistic license does not bother you, this is a valuable addition to any library.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|If you just want a movie to pop in when you want to show off your flat-screen TV and Blu-ray player, buy this. Beyond the visuals though, I was underwhelmed in every other way. The script was mediocre, the acting was average, and the plot was predictable. Is it awful? No. But it's nowhere near worthy of being the highest-grossing movie ever.
B000002B7W|5.0|I bought this CD back when it came out I think 86 or 87 and it was copied from the album mix so the fades from album sides would overlap. This version is mixed and sounds better than the first release.
B0015DROBO|5.0|You know when you say a book was so good you couldn't put it down?  This book is that sort of a read.  My father read the trilogy and recommended them to me.  Having now read them, I have recommended them to friends.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|The White Ribbon is a protracted, stark, mean-spirited picture. The story concerns a series of bizarre accidents and mutilations that plague a small, isolated German village before the dawn of World War I. Shot in crisp black and white, the film is immensely enveloping from a visual standpoint. It feels like it was made in the time period it depicts. Unfortunately, this is a cruel world that most people will not want to be so thoroughly enmeshed within. By and large, the adults who occupy the village are hurtful, dogmatic, fairly awful people. So too, their children are mournful and quietly deranged. The film moves at a glacial pace, meandering about, with scene after scene of wonderment, cut together with very little continuity. There is no music. The dialogue is sparse and at times quite hurtful, especially in the way women are treated. Nevertheless, the production values are astounding. The acting is pitch-perfect, although some of the actors, like The Doctor or The Pastor are such abhorrent beings we wouldn't like to be in the same room with them for more than a few minutes.   In this way, the White Ribbon is a difficult film to enjoy. Like much of Haenke's work, it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. In fact, it is designed to alienate. We are given one central protagonist in the Teacher, who disappears for long stretches of time, and never really gets a lot of answers as to the cause of the strange goings-on...and neither do we, for that matter. He is the film's emotional center, as he courts a young lady from the village. This subplot is far and away the most uplifting  aspect of the film. Otherwise, we see into the lives of the morose and damned. It is not pretty, though, as I said, it is cold and competently delivered.   There is also a nifty symbolic structure at work that I won't ruin. It includes the titular object, as well as a stolen whistle and other meaningful objects. Very strange but it works to add a lot of meaning, I suppose.    Ultimately, the film is meant to present to the viewer the ways in which the German society was ready to latch onto Nazism as an antidote to their personal strife and judging by the way the townsfolk seem to slither through their lives in perpetual malaise, we can see why and how. This is a skillful, damaging work that touches on such disturbing themes as incest, misogynist behavior, child abuse, etc. It is disheartening and there are no clear-cut answers at the end. It is well-done, but not a movie I'd like to watch more than once.
B003UYUR0G|5.0|The Prince of Persia is exactly what you would imagine you'd get in a time-manipulating adventure film made by the makers of Pirates of the Caribbean -- a fast paced, visually enchanting, heavy-on-action-light-on-realism adventure movie. And at that it excels.<br /><br />* mild spoilers *<br /><br />The story itself is not terribly meaty, but it is the tried-and-true stuff of adventure movies: betrayal, romance, and, of course, fighting. In many ways, it is carried by the two lead characters -- Prince Dastan (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Princess Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) -- and the supporting cast (including Ben Kingsley, whose performance as Dastan's uncle, and Alfred Molina, whose performance as a \\"slightly dishonest entrepreneur\\", were masterful).<br />The dialog between the Prince and Princess is at times so \\"cutsie\\" that it ends up cheesy (having heard the original dialog from the game, however, this is a HUGE step up...); but these instances are infrequent, and so not terribly distracting. And, they look good in the roles. Gemma Arterton, with her bronzed skin and henna-dyed hands, is a vision of beauty from ancient legends; and Jake Gyllenhaal, with his buffed physique and \\"puppy dog eyes\\", is a charming rascal of a warrior prince (as contradictory as it sounds). Arterton convincingly projects a spoiled and sheltered outlook, while Gyllenhaal just as convincingly projects a man who does what he knows is wrong because he's told to do it. Each has their flaws, and each must come to trust the other. And, if you're thinking that love is in the making between the beautiful princess and handsome prince, well...would it happen any other way? (As a side note, Gyllenhaal actually performs a lot of the seemingly impossible stunts -- which was really quite impressive. The commentary on the blu ray is pretty fascinating, if you're interested in that sort of stuff.)<br />As good as the lead actors are however, they are often eclipsed by the supporting cast. Ben Kingsley's performance is phenomenal. Without giving too much away, his role is one of the most complex roles in the film, and Kingsley's acting prowess does not fail him. Watch his facial features throughout...he truly is the somewhat cowardly and yet otherwise bold \\"bureaucrat\\" that his character is meant to be. Speaking of \\"bureaucrats\\", Molina's performance -- and his loyal Umbacca (sp?) guard's -- are fantastic. Wayward, greedy, soulless...and yet, drawn to do right by the conscience he no doubt despises (as well as his friend's sense of honor). A perfect performance -- from both men.<br /><br />All in all, this was a good movie. I award it 5/5 stars because it is an excellent film for its genre -- unpretentious, visually spectacular, solid-but-not-overwhelming-story-wise, adventure movies.Kingsley's performance is phenomenal.

B0019FOC5E|4.0|I was excited to receive my CD of Mama Mia.  I saw the show live and I knew the music was great.  The CD arrived promptly.  The price was good.  Unfortunately, three of the tracks had skips in the music. The CD had shrink wrap on it and was advertised as new.  I play my CDs on a Bose Sound System so I know it's not the equipment.  I guess I will not be able to enjoy those songs.
0316077054|5.0|I'm so excited about this review I can hardly stand it. My fingers are nervous with excitement as I type. This book was everything I'd hoped for and much, much more. Kami and Margaret write with such passion and intensity that every time I cracked the book opened I felt like some kind of Caster spell was put on me, for I felt like I was in another world, in a trance. The very same way Beautiful Creatures would make me feel. It's really a great way to ignore the loud children and hungry husband. I can't express how good the writing is. It will take you places you could only imagine in your wildest dreams.<br /><br />Ethan... OH, Ethan. Since my husband does not read my reviews, I can say without hurting his feelings... ETHAN is tha' man. I have dreamt about him, for some reason my husband usually shows up and challenges Ethan to a dual, like in the days of Zorro. ( The mask really adds something ) I don't know where that came from???<br /><br />OK, back to serious. Ethan's love for Lena is so strong and intoxicating. I think that his love for her was the backbone to this entire Caster/Mortal love story. Everything centers around What wouldn't Ethan do for Lena? Ethan goes to the ends of the earth and back for a girl that when he holds her hand, he feels the numbing shock of the cold or when he kisses her he feels literally on fire. Ethan doesn't care about any of that. Risking his life is not even a question when it comes to the love he cherishes most. Believe me Risking his life is an understatement!!! He loves Lena so much it was almost a drug to me when I was reading about it. I know what your thinking... This stay-at-home-mom has completely lost it!!!<br /><br /> Beautiful Darkness took me on a journey that I was not expecting. The Castor tunnels, the forest and the caves were all so well described and painted on paper, I felt like I could read the maps that Liv ( You'll meet her soon enough ) would hold and smooth out on the palms of her hand. Link was such a great best friend, Always there for Ethan and of course was funnier than ever. And Amma, made me miss my grandmother. She was the perfect mix of stubborn, protective and Don't-Even-Roll-Your-Eyes-at-Me-or-I'ma-Gonna-Beat-You-With-a-Stick type of love. You don't know whether to cry because your scared Amma really has a stick or smile because deep down she knows what's best.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say this book was pretty much perfection. I only have one tiny, negative, sad thing to say about this book and that would be, I wish Lena and Ethan were together more like in the BC. Since Lena doesn't want to cause Ethan any harm or put him in any type of danger she tries to keep a safe distance from him. Let me just say, Ethan Wate would have none of that nonsense...<br /><br />There are so many other things I want to say about this book and about the characters that I loved so much, but spoilers would be involved and I can't do that!<br /><br />~Amy [...]there for Ethan and of course was funnier than ever.

0066620996|3.0|What a big and slow book! Very systematical, easy-to-understand, but only borderline inspiring. The message is good, but can be equally well-explained with a big chart - I'd rather have a Sparknotes version of the book in a paperback manual format.
0525423273|5.0|10 stars!!!<br /><br />J'ADORE this book!!!  I was fully expecting to wait a couple of months before reading this because it doesn't come out until December, but while I was on Twitter one day Kiersten White, super cool author of Paranormalcy (WHICH I LOVE, and may actually be my favorite book this year), was tweeting about how much she loved Anna and the French Kiss and how everyone should pre-order it.  Immediately, a couple of other bloggers chimed in and said that it was one of the best books they had read.  Well, I dropped everything else and started reading it....and I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />There are some books that you read when you have the time, and there are some books that you make time to read.....and then there's this book.  Time stood still.  I cared about nothing else.  All I could think about were Anna and St. Clair and what was going to happen between them.  I mean Etienne St. Clair....what about that name?!  Je le trouve bien!!  He was so witty and charismatic, and just plain charming!  An American raised in England who speaks fluent French?  *SWOON* Don't get me wrong, there were a couple of times that I just wanted to haul off and slap him, or I wanted Anna to do it, anyway.  It drove me crazy that he could just string Anna along, all the while having a girlfriend that he seemed to have no intention of breaking up with.  UGH!  Drove me crazy!  But isn't that the point?  These characters were so real to me, and I cared so deeply for them.  I still do!  I'm still thinking about them!<br /><br />I also loved that they all had flaws.  Both physical flaws and character flaws.  Anna has a gap in her teeth and can't to seem handle being alone.  St. Clair is short, bites his nails and has severe phobias about heights and change.  But they don't let their physical flaws consume them, and they work hard to overcome the character flaws when confronted about them.<br /><br />Did I mention how funny this book is?  I can't tell you how many times I laughed while reading it!  And I don't just mean a little chuckle, I mean full out laughing until tears came out of my eyes.  My family kept giving me strange looks and asking if I was ok.  But laughter wasn't my only emotional reaction! Anna made me nervous, and excited, and angry, and sad, and hopeful, but most of all it just made me deliriously happy!  I smiled and I sighed, and then I smiled some more.  And I'm still smiling!  The best Romantic comedy I've ever read!  :)  C'est magnifique!don't just mean a little chuckle, I mean full out laughing until tears came out of my eyes.

B002NXSRVG|4.0|I think this movie is pretty well done. But for true fanatics the battle between Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow needs way more adrenaline. In general, I like it but I am looking forward to see a better sequel. Adios!
B000TGCR38|5.0|This is a five star movie. There was never a dull moment, and the actors were superb! It was a combination of drama, action and also a love story. My husband and I both enjoyed it very much and will probably watch it many more times to come.It's a great find!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|k.d. lang is simply the best singer with her clear, perfect voice and her styling.  She can take an ordinary song and make it extraordinary.  This CD, like her others, is worth buying for the serious fan of this songstress.  I am always amazed at the clarity of her voice and how long she can hold a note!  You will not be disappointed with this CD!

1439152780|5.0|I don't write a lot of reviews, but I am a huge Kate Morton fan.  Her writing style is just wonderful.  I loved every minute of this book and it has become a favorite, like The Forgotten Garden.  The castle, as many have said, is a character on its own.  I loved the way Kate slowly revealed all that was happening in the novel.  Now, we have a looong wait until the next Kate book.  Hurray for Kate -  you make reading a true escape and pleasure.
0525421580|5.0|Here's another entry in the contest to see which John Green book is the best. I was skeptical when I saw that this book was cowritten by another author, David Levithan, and doubly so as I began to read and saw how different the styles of the two authors were. But after a few chapters it all started to make sense, as I saw how different the two same-named characters were. This is a complex, quirky, and refreshingly different book, without a stereotype in sight. If you don't want to read about a gay teen, then avoid the book, but otherwise I encourage everyone to read it, so see how great modern young adult fiction can be. Now I just have to wait patiently for the next entry in the \\"Which John Green Book Is The Best?\\" contest.
0061205699|4.0|An eighth grader like myself doesn't take much interest in classic literature like TKAM. This, however, doesn't mean it wasn't a good book. Harper Lee did a wonderful job of using her own life experience combined with masterful use of an expansive vocabulary to construct a great storyline. Even the movie version, though condensed, won many Academy Awards. If it was a little more modern, I would have enjoyed it more.

B0041VXGRS|4.0|Love the blog, like the book.  I was SO excited about buying this.  I wish I would have bought the hard-cover, and not the e-book for this.  It makes the recipes more challenging to follow.  It's whimsical, and light, and the creatures, and creations are fun.   I made some of the pumpkins for my daughters class, due to nut allgeries, and the kids went nuts, and the teacher asked for the recipe!      There are some downsides for some of the decorations, add-ons are not easy to come by, and you must do a lot of \\"hunting and gathering\\" for the molds and edible markers. One crucial step is getting the cake to frosting ratio just right, otherwise you end up with a gloppy mess.  She recommends 3/4 can of store bought, but 1/2 is close to making them easier to handle. Start with LESS, then add. If you use too much the rolled balls don't retain their shape long. And, make certain NOT to roll your cake balls with a heavy hand.  The chocolate coating WILL crack! I am making the Frosty the Snowman pops for Christmas gifts. The only other downside is finding a way to transport these out of home more safely.  You definitely need a lollipop stand of some sort, and those aren't easy to find either. Fortunately,  I am good with wood, so I am going to get out to the garage to make my own. You will likely ruin your first try or two.  Gets better with practice.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|The right joystick is too high up even thought its level with the controller and is very awkward to use and makes any game unplayable within minutes, it would have be a great controller had it not been for that. The 360 controller is untouchable. I'm not a 360 fanboy at all I actually prefer ps3 but the controller for the 360 is clearly better. Looks like I'm going to have to hope ps4 has a new and improved controller.<br /><br />(Product is going to be returned... nice try Power A)
B0040YFR1Y|3.0|Not really sure how some of the other reviewers can favor this one over the original.  Unless they are basing it solely on Laurence Fishburne's small role in the movie, which he portrayed perfectly. Overall, I would choose the original over this one any day.
B004BSEKH6|5.0|So this is Nicki's first outing and I'll be honest, I don't see where hate can root from this. Yes it's part pop. Have you seen her alter persona? Barbie. She has a chain dedicated to it, she regularly dresses herself up as one, her cover is bubbly pink and white, etc. Going into this cd and NOT expecting aspects of pop is pretty ignorant considering her flagship singles Check It Out, Your Love, and See Right Through Me. He original single planned to be what represents her cd, Massive Attack, was a big flop. So as an artist, how would it benefit her by putting herself in a corner with that sound? With the sounds of those three chosen singles, not only did MORE people gain access to her cd, but those people can also see her MC skills as they listen to the rest of the album. Smart move on her part as well as her management.<br /><br />Now with the Lil Kim stuff, past the fact that they both come from NY and are women, that's all they have in common. Lil Kim wasn't/hasn't been thought of since Nicki got big. Nor has she made a significant track since she's been out of jail. She's stale lyrically. Download with T-Pain? Come on now guys. Not ever female rapper needs to be a model of her. It's about diversity. Style duplication isn't how hip hop gets better. You want Kim's style, get off of Nicki's page and go listen to Kim. Same would apply if someone went on a Kim cd and compared her to Nicki. This whole Kim stuff in general is wild because Missy & Foxy Brown have been better than her since their beginnings.<br /><br />As for the tracks, they're solid and diverse. Not a lot of intros are as put together as I'm The Best. Did It On'em is undoubtedly my favorite track on Pink Friday. She spits not just fire, but acid. Save Me, Moment 4 Life, and Blazin are among the other top tier tracks. Again, I must emphasize the diversity. Her second verse on Fly is highly identifiable/personal/clever. She's a very lyrical woman.<br /><br />\\"I am not a girl that can ever be defined. Iam not fly, I am levitation. I represent an entire generation. I hear the criticism loud and clear that is how I know that the time is near. so we become alive in a time of fear and I aint got no muthaf-cking time to spare. cry my eyes out for days upon days. such a heavy burden placed upon me. but when you go hard your nay's become yay's. Yankee Stadium with Jay's and Kanye's\\"<br /><br />The weakest track I feel that is on here is Romans Revenge. Weak in the sense that she honestly just isn't ready to be featured on a track with Eminem. His lines are outrageous and it would have benefited her to do that song solo. She spits for sure though.<br /><br />Overall, great outing by Nicki. Not a lot of debut albums are as well constructed as this. I'd like to recommended My Beautiful Dark Nightmare and Man on The Moon II
0060987464|5.0|This is a wonderful book, and a perfect work of manson's, especially because it's all true. It is a great autobiography and I am VERY pleased with it. I also enjoyed the pictures that were included inside of the book.
B004AKCME8|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!! I can't wait until December 17th when I can purchase it. I took my 9 year old daughter to see it and I think I liked it more than she did. The visual effects were fabulous. We watched it in 3D which we will not be able to do at home but I look forward to watching it again anyway. This is not a feel good movie though and I don't recommend it for the very young.

0312360258|5.0|This is an great book! I suggest this book to anyone who likes vampires. I enjoy the narrator with her bit of spunk and sarcasm. She is very realistic and I find this book really good. Right now I am on the second book (Betrayed) which I find interesting also.

0451527712|1.0|There's This-Will-Make-You-Stupider Bad, like a James Patterson novel, and then there's something like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein, elegantly written with themes worthy of your contemplation, yet still bad when you consider its preposterous events.<br /><br />* As one reviewer pointed out, the creature is created in less than a paragraph.  And you're not even sure how it happened.  I had to rewind because I thought I'd missed something, but no:  one moment Victor is like, \\"I was reading books\\" and the next he's like, \\"I looked at my creation's black lips and I hated it!\\"<br /><br />* Victor freaks out and just leaves an 8-foot superbeing (that he hates) hanging out at his apartment.  (He does this throughout the whole book, just leaving it at-large somewhere.  He's justifiably deathly paranoid that the fiend might harm his family - it already killed his brother - but he goes to Scotland anyway to build a she-creature.)  (And not just a long working-weekend either, but rather a months-long pleasure cruise around the British Isles.  I don't get it.)<br /><br />*  The creature went from hideous dumb clod to hideous Collin Firth in a matter of months via eavesdropping on some peasants. Fine.  His erudite, eloquent narration is all sensitivity, even as he's describing (to Victor) how he strangled Victor's kid brother.  Fine.  Fine.  Whatever.  I guess I'm okay with it.  Moving on....<br /><br />*  Victor and the creature stalk each other with uncanny success everywhere on the European continent.  And not  just at each other's houses, but in the woods, on boats, in cabins, on mountains, on dog-sleds, across multiple terrains and during different weather systems.  In a coup of because-I'm-the-author-and-I-said-so, Mary Shelly leads us to believe that the creature prepares for Victor a scavenger hunt across the North Pole, leaving taunting messages and even meals of dead hare to nourish Victor for their final showdown.<br /><br />I'll stop there.  There's tons more crazy-unreal coincidences interwoven with breezy descriptions of incredible scenarios.  I thought this was going to be literature on the order of Turn of the Screw or Poe, but no.  It's a fun listen, don't get me wrong.  The language and diction are probably good for you, and you should also be massively entertained by the absurdity of what is purported to be happening.descriptions of incredible scenarios.

B0006B2A42|4.0|I liked this movie so much that after seeing it, I bought the Alistair MacLean book of the same title -- and couldn't make heads or tails of it: It sure was totally different from the movie; about the only thing that was the same was the sub, and the polar ice station.  The two reasons I wouldn't give this one the full five stars are (1) the polar scenes were sort of unrealistic; one could envision the set carpenters cutting,  glueing, and spray-painting the pieces of plywood to form snow-covered ice  boulders, and (2) Jim Brown hadn't learned to act; he was stiff as a poker -- although, in all fairness, his role was by and large a rather thankless one.   The rest of it held up from start to finish; nerve-racking suspense; great undersea scenes and special effects with the sub threatened after someone aboard sabotaged it.  A superb, magnificent score (I can't think of enough great adjectives for that) by Michel LeGrand.    McGoohan is perfect -- totally believable in his role as a British agent; Borgnine overacts, sometimes irritatingly so, but part of that is the character he plays (even the commander found him irritating occasionally), and Rock Hudson is Mr. Cool -- just the kind of guy you'd want commanding such a mission.  Although how his six foot five inches could fit into the confines of a crowded submarine, I don't know.  But one willingly suspends disbelief.  Hudson is such a much better actor that he was given credit for being during his lifetime -- I'd willingly sit and watch him read the phonebook.  Hard to believe that any one man could be that impossibly good-looking.  But he was.    Memorable lines:  When the young Marine lieutenant, obviously a bit nervous about being in such close proximity with a bunch of torpedos stacked next to the bunks, asks Hudson if the torpedos have nuclear warheads, Hudson reassures him that they don't; they're merely Torpex, he says, and each torpedo has no more destructive power than about 400 pounds of TNT.  When the lieutenant tells Hudson that neither he nor his men have ever been on board a submarine before, Hudson's response is, \\"Rest easy; I have.\\"  And the viewer believes him.  This one's a don't miss on many levels:  the plot, the climax, and definitely the STAR.
B004CA2HVE|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I was not a Kanye West fan before I listened to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. I didn't care for his big hit singles like Gold Digger, and his other releases hadn't sparked my interest. (His controversial public outbursts didn't do him any favors either.) Even so, after listening to some samples from this album I was intrigued. It's definitely not your run of the mill hip-hop record. It is a very well composed musical journey.<br /><br />As a heads up to those previewing the tracks, keep in mind that some of the samples are not good representations of the entire song. For example, Who Will Survive in America really flows from the previous track; listening to a sample on it's own doesn't make it sound very interesting, but when played straight through from the previous track it makes sense. Other tracks have a similar problem, especially on longer songs with complex compositions. Give a listen and if you like some of it, you'll probably end up liking more of it.<br /><br />Buy the whole album. It's worth it to hear the complete work. Some stand out tracks for me are Dark Fantasy, Power, All Of The Lights, Monster, and Lost In The World. Another big plus of the deluxe version is getting Kanye's short film Runaway included with the album. Check it out online first; if you're like me and you like having music videos on your portable media device, this one is an excellent find.<br /><br />The biggest downside is the censored artwork on the cover and digital booklet. It's artwork by contemporary artist George Condo and I think it's a tragedy that any art be censored. Honestly, the image itself isn't very shocking so it's barely worth blurring out at all (google it if you're curious).<br /><br />Overall I'm really glad that I took a chance and purchased My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. You can think what you want about Kanye's public persona, but give his newest album a try before you write it off. You might be pleasantly surprised.

0307454541|4.0|I have to admit when I was about 50 pages or so into this book, I thought \\"should I keep going?\\"  It was boring and I couldn't figure out where the author was going with the story.  Lots of backstory and lots of (seemly) unrelated characters.  However, I am glad I stuck with it because by page 100 or so I couldn't put it down.  And, even better, it is a must-read before you read the other two books in this series, which are even better!  I really don't feel one can review this book on its own; you must look at the three books together.  The series of three is captivating.  Truly these are the best books (for its genre) I've read in a while and I read a lot of books.  A bit about me, if it helps, I am female, in my 30's, and have a master's in accounting with a bachelor's in political science.
B00493AD74|4.0|Sometimes when we find love, we lose ourselves.  We meet that amazing individual and before we even know what hit us we have suddenly disappeared inside of a serious relationship.  We disappear because we have begun to neglect our friends, our professional business, our family and often times even our health.  Ladies, think about your last long term relationship?  How did it affect your weight?  I know for me, I tend to gain ten to forty extra pounds when I settle down because we spend so much time eating and laying around enjoying each others company that any focus on fitness seems to fly out of the window. Ultimately, we get to a point where we struggle to find a balance between the love and living a healthy and productive life as an individual.<br /><br /> I've always had a hard time with this, but I came to realize that much of the problem was that I hadn't taken a good enough amount of time to know, love and commit to myself.  As a result, it was easy to pour all of my love into someone else.  Now that I have taken the time to love me first, I've found that I love others in a far more health way.  Even still, a new challenge has risen to the surface.  In an effort to avoid backtracking or resorting to my old ways, I found myself avoiding relationships altogether.  I tried to convince myself that I just wanted to be single so that I wouldn't risk falling into that same unbalanced pattern again.  Just when all of these jumbled and confusing thoughts threatened to overwhelm and consume me, I took a break from my hectic existence to watch the movie, \\"Eat Pray Love.\\"<br /><br />In the movie, based on the book by the same name, a woman my age finds herself in the midst of a marriage and a life that is no longer fulfilling. In an attempt to find her joy, she leaves all that she knows for a year and takes a journey of self-discovery.  On that journey she focuses on learning and loving herself by placing herself in new environments with new people and spending a lot of time in prayer and meditation.  As she nears the end of her journey, love finds her and initially she runs from it feeling that it might cause her to lose that balance that she worked so hard to attain.<br /><br />Just when she is prepared to walk away from the love, a wise teacher that she met along the way reminds her that \\"losing balance for love is a part of living a balanced life.\\" In all of our struggles to get it all right and to have it all figured out,... let's not lose sight of what's really important...Love.<br />[[ASIN:B00179EQNK The Ups and Downs of Being Round]]and meditation.

B000VD5I94|3.0|It's like everyone's said before. Good movie, bad transfer to Blu-ray. Not necessarily bad, just not as good as others, so it doesn't meet many people's expectations. I'm not going to re-hash what others have complained about. I still enjoyed the movie, and for the price I think it was worth it. There definitely could've been more special features, and the transfer to Blu-ray could've been done better. But you can't get enough \\"I'd buy that for a dollar!\\" And the techno-like beat \\"Robocop, dance till you drop, do the Robocop\\" running through your head for hours on end is priceless.

B003PIUBZS|3.0|I have to give this a three star as I am unsure of how I view this DVD. First I have to say that normally I love things like this set in this period time. The filming of this is not what I was expecting but that was fine. I liked the way that is was filmed and the style that it was done. I have to confess though that I found the violence a little to much for me. I don't know whether it was the style of filming or whether I was just not in the right frame of mind but whatever it was at times the detail of the fights was just a little too much.  Now if you are a person who is really into graphic fight scenes and things like that I am sure that you will wonder what on earth you are talking about. I cannot watch much horror or things like that. From what I saw if you like these action pack character series and then some blood and gore I would probably say go for it. For me however I may watch some more but it will not be one that I will go back to again and again although I would like to for the plot.

B001UV4XFG|3.0|All in all, I say the folks in Hollywood did a pretty decent job with the third installment of the Twilight Saga. Every significant plot point was covered(some touched upon more than others), and I felt that the cinematography was a VAST improvement over the last two films. That gastly ethereal lighting from Twilight and New Moon is not present in Eclipse in such concentrated doses, and the action flows a bit more naturally. Also, despite a few overdramatic moments (notably, Jacob's sexy slow-turn introduction), the acting and dialogue showed a distinct improvement from the last two films. However, despite these positive aspects, I cannot help but feel that this film conveyed an unfair bias in Edward's favor that the book did not display. At the beginning of Stephenie Meyer's Eclipse novel, Bella was truly a conflicted young woman. Not only was she graduating high school in just a matter of weeks, but she was also dealing with having to say goodbye to her human life as she prepared to join the Cullen clan. Saying farewell brought the dual burden of convincing her parents that she going away to college in Alaska, meanwhile trying to patch things up with her werewolf best friend Jacob. But as Bella's life is put in danger and her graduation date draws near, she finds herself questioning what she really wants. Though Edward is her proclaimed true love and being apart has proved near-fatal for them in the past, she cannot help but admit that she loves Jacob as well. She admits to herself that life with him would be more practical. Not only could she stay human and have children, but she would never have to say goodbye to her friends and family--her father of whom would be totally ecstatic about her choice. However, though we all know by now that she ultimately chooses Edward in the end, the Eclipse film did not do a very good job of conveying the love triangle element. In the New Moon novel Bella and Jacob got very close, and though Edward returned and she went back tohim, she still had feelings for Jake. But in the film, though Bella shows saddness in having to say goodbye to her mother and father, she has firmly decided whom she wants to be with. Instead of Jacob posing as a viable option, this film portrays him as the desperate best friend who has to resort to forcing himself on Bella to get some action. It is never any secret whom Bella really wants, and she does not reveal her true feelings for Jake as she did in the novel. Those who did not read the books before watching the movies will more than likely be confused, as the \\"love triangle\\" story line that they have heard so much about was not a true conflict, but instead two deeply devoted people who are constantly challenged by the girl's annoying best friend. If you are Team Edward, this bias will delight you to no end. But if you are Team Jacob--you'll be wanting to throw your DVD player against the wall 30 minutes into the film.
B0021L8V0M|1.0|When in history did they ever make movies with one man going about the country and gunning down bad women?  These movies are sexist and I just hope the people who enjoy this trash do not believe in it.  I cannot even mention to anyone that I hate these sexist films to anyone because for some reason this makes me a male chauvinist pig.  I will never understand why because I do know that there are some movies that were released on the theaters but were never released on VHS or DVD.    These films are fantasy and a real insult to men.  Someday this may all have an effect or it may not.  I do not care.  When they start making movies with bad women being gun down by a hero and then they are release on DVD or Blu-ray then maybe things are changing back to reality.
1599218011|5.0|This book is a life changer, and a life saver! It is not a diet book, despite the title. CSD is a lifestyle. Thanks so much to Kris Carr for putting this out there for all of us to learn. I highly recommend this book, and will be giving it to all my friends this Christmas.
0380725398|5.0|This book is truly a gothic classic. It kept me on the edge of my seat from the first page. I was instantly drawn into Mary Yellan's world and I found myself bonded to her and horrified as to what happens. Mary Yellan's mother dies leaving her alone on her farm with no family left but a aunt whom she hasn't seen for ten years. Mary decides to fullfill the dying promise she made with her mother to go and live with her Aunt Patience and Uncle Joss Merlyn who own Jamaica Inn on the untamed and wild British moors. Soon, Mary finds herself trapped in the villianous and wild schemes that are going on within the inn's crumbling walls.  I adore Daphne Du Maurier and I understand perfectly why some many people read her books. She has the most amazing ability to dance along the fine line of reality. The way she expresses herself through her characters is always so haunting and depressing it becomes addicting.
0698115635|4.0|My 2.5 year old daughter adores this book. We bought this one as a replacement (she is very hard on books). I was a little sad that I didn't get it as hard cover, but I sit with her and we read it together, we sing it, she loves it. It is definitely her favorite book.
0679735909|3.0|I wanted to LOVE this book because I had read so much about it, but instead I ended up just liking it. I think the reason I did not love it was because it was different than I had expected. Whether or not you love it or hate it, the author deserves major credit because she created her own masterpiece world of poetry, romance, narrative, diary enteries and love letters. I know that a lot of people did not read the poetry sections of the novel and I too have to admit that a lot of it went over my head as well, but if you give these sections the time and concentration they deserve they really enhance the book. I would suggest this book to anyone who is looking to read something part romance, poetry, imagination, and literary mystery thrown into one.
B002H3T3TM|3.0|61 minutes, about half of which is concert footage including audience chats and monologues  interspersed with various documentary excursions.  The documentary stuff accounts for way to much of the DVD for my taste. Bublé is a talented performer and an engaging personality but this is not the sort of DVD I'd want to watch more than once.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|The movie is great.  But the BluRay DVD is poor quality.  The audio is fine, it's just that the color is often distorted; not HD.  I recommend NOT buying this version of the BluRay at this time.  I suggest one should wait a while, six months or so, for the producers to get the bugs out of their process.  This review is based upon having received a second (replacement) disc from Amazon for the same problem.  Too bad.  I would ask for another replacement, but I am confident it wouldn't be any better.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I went into the theatre not knowing for sure what to expect. But as I watched it, all the emotions felt real, like I was actually there! I was very sad to see the ending, it is one of those movies that you want it to go on forever. I loved the plot and the twinge of romance. I am definitly getting this one as soon as it comes out onto DVD!
B000EWBKK8|4.0|The film is one of the greatest of all times, but there are no extras whatsoever on this blu-ray release.  If they had included at least a commentary track, I would have rated this five stars.  Given the low price I would still urge you to buy this.  If you are a fan of Blow or Thank You For Smoking, then you will definitely want to add this one to your collection.
B001ADPMQS|5.0|This is the most spectacular representations of Santa Clause there ever has been and most likely, unless they decide to remake this film, Ever will be!    No other film delves so deeply into the true origin of Santa, nor puts the effort or time into creating the workshop or the elven characters.    This film had the budget, the characters, and wonderfully acted cast members who play a heartwarming and exciting adventure through the world of the holiday season and the true meaning of giving.    This is in my proud opinion the greatest Santa Claus film ever created and one of the best Christmas movies that will ever be.    Be sure to watch this film... netflix if you must, but it is a must watch every holiday season for me.    I also recommend \\"The Stingiest Man in Town\\" and \\"Earnest Saves Christmas\\" ;)    Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!!!!!!!!!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|Ok, so some people have written about the bad quality of the blu-ray DVDs on here but I have to disagree with that. The grainy/scratchy visual shots really make you feel what the characters feel - they are dirty, tired, and full of despair, and that comes through so well in HD! I didn't know this show was a remake until I saw [[ASIN:B004CYF708 Battlestar Galactica: Cast & Creators Live at Paley]] where Ron Moore and David Eick talk about how they re-created the 1970s version into this show...and that makes even more sense in terms of the visual production choices.     The audio of this set was amazing. I've watched the finale probably a million times at this point and every single time the combination of beautiful pictures on screen, especially the fly-over shots over grasslands at the end, with the haunting
B003616M3O|4.0|I bought \\"Third Round\\" by chance in the summer (of 2010).  I was looking for \\"Neighbourhood\\" with its star studded cast.  But found \\"Third Round\\" instead as this was the new release at that point in time.  It has since been a constant (and very welcome) companion in my car. Whilst I have subsequently added Manu Katche's two previous ECM recordings to my collection, I have developed a soft spot for this one.  It's the type of recording that just may appeal to a good many more people than would otherwise be attracted to the ECM catalogue (for the reasons that the other reviewers have mentioned).    So here are a few suggestions that might help you assess if this could be a recording that you would enjoy over repeated playings.  I would give it a try if one or more of the following apply to you:    1. You like the Amazon samples (they really do give a good feel for the whole recording).    2. You like the smoother side of jazz and would like to expand into more acoustic recordings.    3.  You have heard Manu Katche's previous ECM recordings and prefer \\"Playground\\" over Neighbourhood\\".    4.  You like beautifully played instrumental music that is contemporary jazz in style but not too heavily improvised.     5.  You like music that is great to unwind to but carries sufficient surprise and inventiveness to stimulate your own creativity and imagination (how could Manu Katche not achieve the element of surprise with his percussive skills).    Overall I find that \\"Third Round\\" builds on the direction that Manu Katche has set with his first two ECM recordings.  It's somewat more accessible than Neighbourhood (guitar on 3 tracks and a smattering of Fender Rhodes).  And along with Allen Toussaint's \\"The Bright Mississippi\\" is at the top of my personal list of favourite purchases of the year.
1400052173|5.0|I found the entire book fascinating: the story of Henrietta and her family as well as learning more about cells, the history of the scientists involved and now the ethical dilemmas involved in tissue/cell research.   What an amazing story!!  I love it when I can enjoy a great story and learn a ton in the process.  The author is an amazing story teller -- very talented.
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I've had this for some time now and it is a must have to connect any FireWire 400 peripheral be it a hard drive, camcorder or the like when all you have is a FW800 port(s).    This adapter fits really nice, snug and can be positioned how needed so as to not place any stress on the end of the cable or FW port.    Best simple solution that can travel with you or stay at home.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Pixar continues its excellence with this third Toy Story movie. Their comic genius spans across all ages. If you liked the first two movies, you will love this one!!
B00495XR8E|2.0|I'm disappointed about two things: 1) the TOC isn't set up correctly 2) text color isn't formatted correctly. As another reviewer noted, the TOC doesn't work - when you select \\"Go to\\", the TOC option is greyed out. When using iPod, Android, iPhone, Mac Kindle software with white text on black background - the TOC, chapter headings, and some chapters become unreadable (dark grey text on black background).
B00003CXE7|5.0|One of the best!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I rarely purchase music CDs as I'm just not into a lot of \\"listening\\" anymore; busy writing and need quiet if not silence to make the most of my time. I am making an exception for this; it's my first exposure to this artist, whose producer grabbed my 'attention' when I was doing research on Rubin's film production. I love Groban's voice and the songs on here! The lyrics drew me in, and don't laugh, they made me remember a concert performance of Roger Whitaker that I enjoyed very. Anyone who likes this genre will love the music.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Very nice!

B001UV4XFG|5.0|It is now 8:24pm on Dec.4th. I preordered Eclipse on Nov. 15th so I would get it the day of release on Dec.4th. I won't get it until Monday Dec.6th, hopefully!!  What is the point in preordering, I could have just paid $2.00 more at Walmart to get it the day of release. I used to be able to preorder an item from amazon and get it on the day it came out, but now it may be better to just wait and get it at the store!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00007BKVC|5.0|This movie delivers fun with a punch.  The coupling of sheer thrill of escapism and banal reality doesn't get any better than this.  I enjoyed it tremendously despite considering myself fairly unacquainted with the overarching \\"culture\\" the story is set in.    The profound attention to detail (casting, characters, musical score, pacing, backdrops and numerous other unknown transparent factors) that went into the making of this exquisite movie is hard to miss.
B0000542D2|5.0|I am very happy with my purchase ! It came to me quick and I was surprised. Great price too for the quality. Great service! thanks
B002PMV9FG|2.0|HP & the Half-Blood Prince    This was one of my favorite books in the series and so I especially looked forward to the movie.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  AAUUUGHH!    I waited for YEARS (!) and FIVE books anticipating the day when the Dursleys would receive their long-deserved comeuppance from Dumbledore for their poor treatment of Harry...  And WHAT HAPPENED?!    They actually FILMED the scene, and then decided (after I had anticipated it for YEARS ) that the audience didn't care enough about the books as written  to sit through such a LONG scene, and they cut it, only to replace it with an equally long  scene involving a presumptuous teenaged tart in a greasy-spoon diner: Harry hacks up a foreshortened verbal ejaculation, and she instantly presumes he was going to ask her out?!  Please...! What has been established about his character to make it plausible that he would entertain such an unlikely interest?    And the meeting between the Minister of Magic and the Muggle Minister...? \\"(Cough, cough...) AHEM! \\"Where did THAT go?!  It was ONLY one of the best, FAR ABOVE & BEYOND, most enjoyable and exquisitely disturbing and creepy...,  of all the scenes in all the books so far. So..., WHERE THE HELL DID IT GO?!    Which EXCESSIVELY INFLUENTIAL PERSON decided that this savory and delicious scene was not worth taking the time to watch?  And WHY do they still have a job?!    But I must say the most offensive change made from the book to the movie involved a violation of HP's character. In the book, HP used the potions book of the Half-Blood Prince to his advantage (no harm there), until he used a spell to harm another student in self-defense. Even though he used the spell innocently in self-defense, author Rowling treated it as an act of evil (with which I disagree).  But the movie takes a turn for the worse:  Harry is so uncertain of his right to self-defense in a threatening situation that he allows Ginny Weasley (portrayed most unattractively by Bonnie Wright) to substitute for his inner moral conscience, and then because he is such a weakly indecisive and spineless \\"hero...\\" She must take the spellbook from his hands and hide it while his eyes are closed!  This scene, by itself, suggests that Harry Potter is a moral ignoramus and coward.     The spellbook represents Knowledge, which in itself is neither good nor evil, but only as it is applied. So this scene implies that Harry is afraid of knowledge because he does not have the Wisdom and Strength of character to apply it ethically.  However I must admit that this flaw of character originates with the author Rowling, and is only amplified in the movie.     Also, Slughorn was miscast. (An actor  in Deathly Hallows Pt 1 seemed better for the part of Slughorn, but must have been too late).  Slughorn bursting from the armchair was painfully embarrassing!  Not convincing at all!  They should have at least digitized the effect! Barbara Eden smoking out of her bottle was MORE CONVINCING!..., and THAT was 4.5 DECADES ago!  You HAVEN'T come a long way, Baby..., er, Dude!!    It boggles my mind that with so much MONEY and so much TIME, such a POOR job was accomplished!    On the OTHER hand, if you've NEVER READ THE BOOKS, this movie MIGHT be thoroughly enjoyable!
031603438X|4.0|For an excellent comprehensive review of the book I recommend reading Jesse Kornbluth's review.  I'll merely riff on my own observations differing from Mr. Kornbluth's.<br /><br />This could have been a two-volume work.  So don't let the 547 pages intimidate you; there's no filler here except perhaps the obligatory one-chapter narrative on his childhood prior to becoming a musician.  The opening chapter is LOL funny.<br /><br />What Mr. Richards left out that I was hoping to get more perspective on was the stories behind production of most of the mid-1970s and later albums.  Notably missing was substantial narrative on producing \\"Some Girls\\", \\"Emotional Rescue\\", \\"Tattoo You\\", and \\"Undercover\\" which were the post-Mick Taylor / Ron Wood years and when they were far more of a rock band they were previously when they mixed in much more country, blues, and soul.  Also missing is how the Stones got their mojo back on \\"A Bigger Bang\\" given so many lackluster albums prior to that release.<br /><br />I also was disappointed Mr. Richards didn't spend much time discussing his peers' guitar work, such as Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, and Pete Townshend.  He criticizes Mick Jagger a couple of times for being too influenced by David Bowie, Elton John, or whatever happened to be hot in the dance clubs, so perhaps that's my answer.  In addition I was surprised at how little he discussed other contemporary major rock bands.  For example, I would love to have his perception on Led Zeppelin.<br /><br />A couple of questions I had prior to reading this book were answered.  For example, how did their sound radically change for the better starting on Beggar's Banquet and not just from adding Mick Taylor who didn't substantially appear until \\"Sticky Fingers\\"?  Why did Mick Taylor, by far the best guitar partner Keith ever enjoy having in the band, leave?  I get a satisfactory answer that also reveals why no substantial answer was previously forthcoming regarding Taylor's stupefying departure.  In fact the sound change is masterful writing, providing the technical details I'm sure has a lot of young guitar players experimenting, but also described in a manner that allows a non-musician like me to appreciate and enjoy reading how this evolution occurred.<br /><br />Another frustration I've had with the Stones' is in regards to what they publish regarding whose playing which guitar parts on their studio albums.  In addition nearly all their authorized videos make it difficult to tell which guitar player is playing which part.  For example, you always know which parts Brad Whitford and Joe Perry are playing in Aerosmith or in AC/DC, Angus and Malcolm Young.  Mr. Richards' reveals this is by design and has to do with his sensibilities playing within a band and how guitar players should interact, along with Mr. Richard's reliance on overdubbing (which makes me wonder about whether they're adding sound in their concerts beyond what Wood and Richards are playing live).  This revelation is perhaps a primary reason Richards has kept the band together for so long and why the Stones have been able to produce so many great songs rather than merely feature a couple of great guitar solos and then fade into obscurity.<br /><br />Another feature of the book I especially liked was the short blurbs written by other people who participate in the events depicted in the book.  Not his band-mates but instead some of the session players, women in his life, or people who had a more accurate perspective than Keith's regarding that particular story.<br /><br />And in spite of its heft,  \\"Life\\" is a quick compelling read.  Highly recommended for all rock fans.  Never underestimate Keith Richards, the man is far more intelligent, talented, and productive than how he comes across on TV.change is masterful writing, providing the technical details I'm sure has a lot of young guitar players experimenting, but also described in a manner that allows a non-musician like me to appreciate and enjoy reading how this evolution occurred.

B004ASVS0E|5.0|With her voice top notch, Annie brings old classic Christmas songs to LIFE!   Full of energy and refreshingly produced such as God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen and II Est Ne Le Divin Enfant with African drums; as well as In the Bleak Midwinter, Holly and Ivy,  the record has an old school celtic flavor, a modern passionate pulse running throughout. Overall quite enormous fun!      The one new song, Universal Child written by Annie Lennox, donates all proceeds to Annie Lennox Foundation.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Enough already about originality of the story line. Small town girl with BIG talent has to prove herself and overcome skeptics and adversaries to finally achieve success. No real spoilers here! Certainly you are not here to see Christina fail! And Burlesque handles this story well, with some great supporting actors who bring plenty of drama, charm and personality to amuse us. I have seen countless movie musicals from the days of Busby Berkley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bing Crosby, and Gene Kelly. Its really all about the songs, music and dance!!! This is a vehicle that showcases the amazing talents of Christina Aguilera, and shows us Cher at 64 has still got what made her famous too! Cher and Christina have BOTH been nominated for \\"Best Song\\" Golden Globe awards from Burlesque, and both deserve it. In addition, if there is any Oscar Buzz it should go to the stage designers, lighting engineers and cinematographers that made every frame of this incredible film a work of art. They have set a landmark for stage lighting. Not that it needs it, but this film could have been pretty amazing in 3-D too. I want to see more live action 3-D in something besides Cartoons and Sci-Fi. On another note, I do hope this will inspire someone to actually make a feature film about the history of real burlesque, or a showcase of today's modern burlesque...this was not it, and I did not expect it to be. Enjoy Burlesque for everything it is, an amazing showcase of talent!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Definitely worth it - such a great series. Any whedonite or you know, breathing person can enjoy the content. DVD came quickly & in perfect shape, special features are a little short but nothing to do with Amazon. The \\"unaired episodes\\" aren't secret - simply the ones that weren't on network TV. If you like Firefly, invest in Serenity (same in reverse!)
B003EYVXTG|1.0|I'm sorry but I just couldn't get into this movie.  It's billed as a \\"thriller\\" but it's nowhere near that.  It reminded me of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" like Dorthey going all over the place to no end looking for the Oz, but here it's Ree looking for her father.  This film was quite dull and uneventful and nearly put me to sleep.  They didn't even show Ree chainsawing her father's hands off at the end.  At least show us something memorable and gory after we spent hours watching her look for this guy.  Another thing is I'm not into any movie that deals with the crystal meth thing.  I don't find it entertaining and I don't want to go down that road!  I guess I was disillusioned, especially hearing it had Oscar buzz and all that.  Different strokes for different folks.
0316069485|5.0|As a trial attorney, this is the best reality based procedural courtroom drama stories that I recall.  I agree with some of the criticisms as to the new direction for Bosch and a questionable (too easy) denouement, but just can't take a star away because this has all of the elements that I am looking for in a book like this:  multi-dimensional characters, story, accuracy/realism and writing quality.  I was beginning to think Connelly was off his game, but this one redeems a couple of missteps.  Thanks!
0802130208|5.0|A Confederacy of Dunces is one of my favorite books. In this picaresque novel, John Kennedy Toole creates a vivid and hilarious world, the French Quarter of the 1960s, and populates it with unforgettable characters and fantastic scenes. His protagonist is Ignatius J. Reilly, perhaps the first slacker in American literature. He disdains work and the modern world, longing for the Middle Ages when his genius would be appreciated.<br /><br />I read A Confederacy of Dunces in college and loved it from the very first pages. It's a broad comedy, expertly told by someone who clearly knows every inch of his beloved New Orleans. Moreover, Toole was familiar with the slang and patois of the city's residents. He portrays them as corrupt, flawed, confused - but always well-meaning, in their own way.<br /><br />In the book, Ignatius J. Reilly is forced to leave his cocoon of Big Chief tablets and Dr. Nut, encountering the real world with various levels of misadventure. He stumbles from farce to farce, never really changing, as his overbearing mother grows weary of his inability to lead a normal life.<br /><br />The book is wrapped up with a deus ex machina, like another great book from the 1960s, [[ASIN:0684833395 Catch-22]]. Both Toole and Joseph Heller created characters (Reilly, Yossarian) that were too big to be contained in a mere novel and essentially leap off the stage at the end.

0399536108|4.0|I listened to Chris Guillebeau speak at the Barnes and Noble in downtown DC. Chris is one of my favorite bloggers, from the Art of Non-Conformity. His message is that you don't have to live like everyone else, that you should follow your passions while looking to leave something behind.<br /><br />He lives what he writes about - he's on a quest to visit every country in the world and has been in 125 of them so far.<br /><br />Now he has a book, also called The Art of Non-Conformity, and is off on a 50 state tour to support it. His publisher thinks he's crazy. As a writer myself, I think he's crazy - North Dakota?<br /><br />In person, he's much like his blog - more curious about the audience than himself, non-judgemental, cognizant of how lucky we in the West are to have the \\"problem\\" of following our dreams. After speaking for a bit (and filling in DC on his 50 state map), he took questions from the audience.<br /><br />Why did he write a book? Blog posts don't change lives, was his answer. His goal in writing the Art of Non-Conformity was to get people to positively change and to share his and others stories of how to do it.<br /><br />One goal of his book has been to bring people together. In the Q&A session, he let the audience answer each other's questions, covering such diverse topics as entrepreneurship and conflict-free diamonds.<br /><br />What I like about Chris is that he doesn't say that there is one magic answer for everyone - it's not Scientology or the 4-Hour Work Week. Your quest to change yourself, and the world, can involve very small steps - life experiments, where you get away from your desk and visit an art gallery. Or start learning a new language during your commute.<br /><br />Unlike other so-called \\"life hackers\\", he believes that the quest for efficiency is overrated. A new method of burning through your email is meaningless. It's better to figure out how you can pursue adventure while helping others.<br /><br />In his view, the core questions to think about are:<br /><br />What do you want out of life?<br /><br />What can you offer the world that no one else can?<br /><br />These questions have enormous resonance. The Art of Non-Conformity aims to guide people in finding their own answers.can you offer the world that no one else can?    These questions have enormous resonance.

159562015X|4.0|I took the StrengthsFinder 2.0 test. It asks you a series of questions on how you like to work, how you get along with other people and how you've organized your life. You have 20 seconds to answer each question because they want your gut responses, without a lot of thinking. The same kind of questions are asked again and again, in slightly different formulations, to find out how strongly you feel about something. When answering, you choose a range of responses from \\"agree strongly\\" to \\"disagree strongly.\\"<br /><br />When you're done with this online test (it takes 20-30 minutes to complete), you're presented with a list of your top five strengths.  Here's mine:<br /><br />Input<br />Strategic<br />Intellection<br />Maximizer<br />Learner<br /><br />I took this test three years ago, when it was part of Now, Discover Your Strengths.  Interestingly, I had the same five strengths when I took it last, just in a slightly different order.<br /><br />What's different in StrengthsFinder 2.0 is, along with a list of your strengths, it provides a couple of additional tools to help you become happier and more effective. The first is a personalized guide that contains:<br /><br />* Brief descriptions of all five of your strengths<br /><br />* Your Personalized Strengths Insights, which describe what makes you stand out from others with the same theme in their top five<br /><br />* Some examples of what the theme \\"sounds like\\" -- real quotes from people who also have the theme in their top five<br /><br />* Ten very practical ideas for action for each strength<br /><br />* A Strengths Discovery Activity to get you thinking about how your talents and your investment work together to build strengths that you can apply to your work and personal life<br /><br />* A Strengths-Based Action Plan for review with a friend, manager, or colleague.<br /><br />There's also a simple online tool where you can pick from their suggestions on how to improve yourself and build a custom guide of practical ideas for you to follow.<br /><br />If you're a compulsive planner, StrengthsFinder 2.0 is for you. But I think it's also useful for people going through a career transition or just wondering if they're in the right job.<br /><br />I strongly agree with the core philosophy of StrengthsFinder - you should concentrate your efforts on what you're best at, rather than trying to improve upon your weaknesses.

B003UESJF6|3.0|***<br />What is it about Dreamworks' animated films? They just don't measure up. Which is a shame. They employ inventive stories, top-notch animation, yet they always seem to fall short.  When compared to Pixar and Disney offerings. Maybe they need to develop a reputation, a following for a particular kind of animation, much like Warner Bros. was known for creating some truly \\"Looney Tunes\\". Get it?.<br /><br />I love animated films and see many every year. The best are always from Pixar; they always set and consistently raise the bar for all others combining brilliant animation, funny characters and superb storytelling. How often are you so moved by a sequence in an animated film that it brings you to tears? I can name a few from Pixar films. Disney is a fairly close second. The animation is beautiful (they created the feature length animated film and have a rich and bountiful history to draw from), the films are usually funny and the storytelling is good. Disney is best at adapting fairy tales, giving them a little spin, so they start off with some pretty good source material. Dreamworks is a distant third. The animation is always beautiful and rich, but they just aren't very funny. This is strange, surprising, and even maddening given the huge amount of comedic talent employed in their films. Also, they seem unable to capture the same depth of detail Pixar brings to their films. Perhaps this is why Dreamworks seems all over the map; they change animation and narrative styles with each new film, something Pixar also does. But Pixar has mastered this. Dreamworks hasn't.<br /><br />\\"Shrek\\" really established Dreamworks as a possible contender to the animation throne. Based on a children's book, the character and subject matter allow the filmnmakers to take pot shots at everything that makes Disney Disney. Add incredible voice talent from Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas and John Lithgow and you have the makings of a huge hit. Because of the success of this film, Dreamworks has since made three sequels, continuing the story of the popular ogre and delivering films with wildly differing results. What \\"Shrek\\" also did was establish the prescedent o using established film actors as voice talent in animated films. This was something Robin Williams proved could work, but the studios were reluctant to part with so much money sticking primarily with television, Broadway and undiscovered talent. But \\"Shrek\\" made it a reality. Now, every Dreamworks film boasts big name talent with mixed results. Will Smith, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Reese Witherspoon, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Anjelina Jolie continue to lend their talents to various projects.<br /><br />The reason I continue to go to these films? The animation is usually pretty beautiful. \\"King Fu Panda\\" was one of the most beautlfully animated films I have ever seen. But it isn't very funny.<br /><br />Now, we have \\"Megamind\\" starring Will Ferrell, Brad Pitt, Tina Fey and Jonah Hill. Again, great to look at and fun to watch in 3-D, but surprisingly few laughs. Also it seems a little too close to the superb \\"The Incredibles\\", knocking it down a few points for originality.<br /><br />Megamind (Ferrell) and Metro Man (Pitt) have been rivals since they first arrived on this planet as babies. Megamind spends his every waking moment trying to figure out how to escape prison and finally out do his nemesis, Metro Man. His plans usually involve some sort of elaborate contraption in his lair, with many of the details set forth by his minion (David Cross). But Metro City (pronounced very differently with great comedic effect by the villain) loves Metro Man and his seems to thrive on the adulation. Roxanne Richie (Fey), a local news reporter, always seems to get caught in the middle of the tug of war, spending time as the bait in Megamind's plan. One day, Megamind surprises everyone and beats his rival. But he becomes bored and decides to create a new hero, Tighten, fashioning his new nemesis from Hal (Hill), Richie's cameramen. But Hal likes his new powers too much and becomes bored being a hero, so he starts to wreak havoc on Metro City. Who will save the day? Megamind soon realizes he has to step in and set things right.<br /><br />Directed by Tom McGrath (\\"Madagascar\\" and its sequel), \\"Megamind\\" is fun to watch, especially in 3-D, but it isn't very memorable.<br /><br />Ferrell does an interesting job of bringing the alien orphan to life, narrating the life story of both he and Metro Man and bringing us up to speed. His character is more amusing than funny. He frequently mispronounces words and his \\"diabolical\\" plans are engaging and fun to watch. Pitt is also good as Metro Man, the super hero who does good things, but his ego is also clearly something that needs to be fed. Luckily, the people of Metro City are only too glad to feed it, heaping adulation on him. Tina Fey is fun as the street wise reporter who isn't really afraid of Megamind, she has been his captive too often and Metro Man always saves her.<br /><br />But when Megamind begins to groom Hal to become the new superhero, Tighten becomes a little too similar to Syndrome, the character played by Jason Lee in \\"The Incredibles\\". Once this happens, you start to see other similarities and the new Dreamworks production feels a bit like a retread.<br /><br />All animated features are now being produced and released in 3-D. The extra money is too lucrative to the theaters and the studios, and these extra few dollars per ticket helped make \\"Toy Story 3\\" the #1 animated film of all time. And I like watching these films in 3-D, even when it doesn't really seem necessary. The 3-D adds a layer of texture to the universe created by the filmmakers. Thankfully, in a Pixar film, you embrace this extra level of detail because the tapestry is so beautiful to begin with. It isn't necessary to have things flying at your face to take advantage of the 3-D process. In \\"Megamind\\", they go the same route. It seems to add another texture to the story and little else. It doesn't even really seem to enhance all of the flying sequences.<br /><br />The story also seems to meander a bit. When Megamind becomes bored, he takes on another persona and... Well, I'll stop before I reveal too much but this part seems a bit slow.<br /><br />\\"Megamind\\" is a wash. Not memorable or funny enough to make it a family classic which is a shame because the animation is good.<br /><br />I think Dreamworks needs to rethink their strategy. Come up with a consistent type of story and animation. One moment, we have the stylized retro characterizations of \\"Monsters Vs. Aliens\\", the next, we have the almost painterly backdrops of \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" and gorgeous animation that almost looks hand drawn. First \\"Shrek\\", featuring computer generated characters taking aim at the fairy tales of the most famous Disney features, then we have \\"Over the Hedge\\", a cutesy animated film based on a popular newspaper comic strip. If they were to develop a particular style, it might help them strive to make it the best and to make the best films. As it stands, they seem like they are all over the place.<br /><br />And \\"Megamind\\" rests firmly in the middle.t Hal likes his new powers too much and becomes bored being a hero, so he starts to wreak havoc on Metro City.

0307463745|1.0|I made the mistake of buying this book before reading a couple sample pages. Half the book is made up of cartoon pictures, and the other half is useless tidbits of business advice that are nothing more than common sense. Like a movie with no plot or substance,don't waste your time and money on this one!

B000VS6R26|5.0|Although there were other films with the Titanic, no one but James Cameron put it into a fictional setting and still paid tribute to the film's history as well as Cameron has.<br /><br />A top box office hit for many, many years until Avatar (also directed by Cameron), Titanic sticks to history's facts regarding the tale, but plays us with a love story, as well as statements regarding the aristocracy.<br /><br />I'm sure the dear reader is already familiar with the basic plot of Titanic:  a scientist who has spent three years preparing for a salvage operation of the Titanic to look for a fabulous diamond that was rumored to be in the safe.  He discovers it's not there!<br /><br />We then find an elderly woman who is flown in to tell her tale.  The tale of Rose and Jack.  Now simplistically it may be seen as a movie where she meets this great guy and their adventures together.  But the script is a bit more complex than that!<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />The aristocracy versus the working class is a main theme.  In fact, Rose's mother, facing destitution, sees her daughter marrying into millions is the only way to avert disaster.  Rose however feels trapped by her aristocratic traditions and just wants out.  And if suicide is the only out, then so be it.<br /><br />Another theme is free spirit.  Jack takes a chance and wins a couple of tickets to the Titanic's maiden voyage.  He and his Italian friend get on board just as the ropes are cast.  What an adventure!  I would have liked to see more scenes of Jack and his friend as well as how they deal with their roommates, since the tickets belonged to \\"Sven\\" and they have no clue who Jack is.<br /><br />Anyway, Jack and Rose collide.  Their worlds are forever changed.  That is, until the Titanic makes its own collision with an errant iceberg!<br /><br />Another theme is pride and arrogance.  The captain is convinced by one of his solicitors that if he turns on all steam engines and comes into New York ahead of schedule, what headlines they will make.  But by doing so, the ship goes so fast and it's so big that it cannot turn on a dime, much less a quarter, and this makes quite an impact with passengers and crew.<br /><br />Finally, the theme of the lower class.  Rose shows Jack high society.  Jack then shows Rose the goings on below decks with an Irish jig and a few drinking games that get a bit wild.  Which is it Rose?  High society and arrogant pride, or a free spirit and living your life as you choose?<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Although the audience knows it's not really looking at an ocean liner, the epic effects, the musical themes, the sound effects of the disaster are clearly not being put aside.  The crowds of people dying in the water, the blockheads of the White Star Line running the lifeboats who do not attempt rescue are both shocking and disturbing.<br /><br />You will be disturbed, shocked, enamored and amazed by what Cameron has done with Titanic.  It holds up as well in 2010 as it did in 1997.<br /><br />Rewatch it -- re-experience the magic of an early 20th century disaster that held a world of hope and despair within and without its hull intact!<br /><br />Other Cameron Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0044XV3QY Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005V9IL The Abyss (Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000F9RB9Y The Terminator [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />Other DiCaprio Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002ZG980U Inception]]<br />[[ASIN:B001GCUO5M Shutter Island]]<br /><br />Other Kate Winslet Films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MQC9H4 The Holiday]]<br />[[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)]]hip goes so fast and it's so big that it cannot turn on a dime, much less a quarter, and this makes quite an impact with passengers and crew.

I wish there were more songs like \\"Romans Revenge,\\" but this album was one of the best Freshmen albums I have ever heard. This album will keep me going for a while. Definitely suggest buying. Support Nicki! :)
B00000IZOR|3.0|I thought about waiting to get this when my son turned one. However, on a visit to my best friend's house, he was playing with one with his friend in the playpen. It is amazing that he knew it was a phone since we do not have any corded phones in the house, just cell phones. He did have to pick up the entire phone since the corded cord is very short, not like the old style ones. As previously stated by other reviewers, I am sure that this is for safety reasons.    He mostly had fun just dialing the phone to make the ringing bell sound. As far as the intended purpose of pulling it along, he never really did that, as he lost interest in this toy when he got old enough to walk. It is an inexpensive durable toy, so I wouldn't say that it was a total waste.

B0045XICB2|4.0|As far as the Twilight saga is concerned, this movie was almost equally as good as the first two. The original will, as with most other sagas, always be the best. The development of the characters, the awkward transgressions, and the audience knowing what is going on before the characters does, keeps you hanging off of your seat when you watch the first film of a saga, or series, or trilogy. Once that thrill is over it is hard to bring that back. In Eclipse, the drama was intense, almost too intense. The love story....well, that one is slipping. I must say, the as a member of the audience, I knew what was going to happen the whole time. It was only the slipping love story that had me surprised at all. I certainly hope the screen writer does not include wordings and shots that give too much away next time. But, all said, I still give it a four out of five, and I will watch the next one the watch the love story play out and to see if the can add some more suspense and exitement to the next one
0385334176|4.0|Deadeye Dick is unmistakably a Kurt Vonnegut book. With its meandering storyline, beautiful asides, funny and cynical writing, and memorable characters, there's no way this could be written by anyone other than Vonnegut, and much of the joy of the book comes from just enjoying Vonnegut's style. That being said, Deadeye is also one of Vonnegut's weaker books. The introduction - in which he explains some of his thoughts behind the book and gives some information as to some of the book's symbolism - helps clarify things a bit, but the book never really coalesces much, ultimately just kind of feeling ramshackle and strung together. That's okay, really; Vonnegut has always felt like that, and no one can make that sort of journey more satisfying and enjoyable. And there's definitely no shortage of events here, between a narrator who's an accidental murderer, an exploding neutron bomb, a mysterious decapitation, a Nazi-adoring father, fake painters, and more. It just never really comes together in the end to anything more than a general lament for the slow slipping-away of life, and the lack of focus ultimately leaves you feeling a little disappointed in the book or like you missed the point of it all. So, yeah, it doesn't compare to his best works. But if you're a fan, you'll enjoy the ride here, minor book and all. It's still funny, still beautifully dry, still delightful, still moving - it's just not all that focused. But it's still a great journey to take.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|First off, let me start by saying that I began viewing this movie, with not only a totally open mind, but also an excited & eager/enthusiastic one as well. Because as bad as it may or does sound, I have been a Holocaust buff, and have been interested in anything & everything about the Holocaust (especially HOW & WHY it was allowed to happen) for almost as long as I can remember.<br /><br />As such, movies (and books) dealing with the Holocaust are & have been a favorite genre, and therefore I was really looking forward to seeing this film - particularly since the blurbs/synopses implied, \\"The Reader\\" is a Holocaust movie with themes focusing on the HOW & WHY of its occurrence, something I am especially interested in.<br /><br />However, I have to say that I was pretty disappointed with this movie.<br /><br />First of all, the movie dragged on WAY too much - especially in the beginning/middle, without (or before) even getting into the subject of the Holocaust. It wasted too much time (literally almost HALF the film!) on the steamy/torrid summer affair between the thirty-something Kate Winslet's character, Hanna Schmitz, and the teenage Michael Berg (played by David Kross in the 15/16 year old character & Ralph Fiennes as an adult)<br /><br />Seriously, at least the first 40 minutes (if not more!) of this 2 hour movie was spent on the clearly pedophilic affair between Hanna Schmitz and Michael Berg, which could've done with a FRACTION of the time spent on it, and that, in all honesty, boils down to just a few points:<br /><br />1. Michael gets sick, walking home from school & is helped to get back home by Hanna Schmitz, after which it is learned that Michael is stricken with scarlet fever and has to be bedridden for 3 months.<br />2. After recovering, Michael goes to Hanna's with flowers to thank her, for her help, and unexplainably ends up in a steamy pedophilic affair with this 30-something stranger during which Michael reading to Hanna from various books is the foreplay, and he neglects his family, friends & social events to spend all his time with Hanna, seemingly without more than a cursory mention by his father once, in regards to his being tardy to dinner.<br />3. After a torrid summer affair, Hanna suddenly moves with NO word to Michael, leaving him bereft & despondent.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even after this endless half (more or less, anyway!) the movie doesn't get that much better.<br /><br />Eight years after the affair with Hanna, Michael is a law student, taking a special seminar in which he observes the trial of some female Nazi guards who had let 300 people burn to death in a locked & barred church, and discovers, to his dismay, that one of the guards on trial is his own former lover, Hanna Schmitz.<br /><br />Yet though Michael is harboring a secret of Hanna's that could, though not necessarily exonerate her completely, could clear her of the most serious charges, and despite even his professor urging him to come clean to the court, he does not & just lets whatever is to happen to Hanna to happen.<br /><br />On top of that, with the exception of a brief mention, by a fellow classmate of Michael's, who brings up the fact that despite everyone knowing about the concentration camps & death camps, how & why did the Holocaust happen, the second half of the movie is wasted focusing on this secret about Hanna that Michael is harboring, and bouncing back ad forth between various time periods, (1995, 1958, the mid-to-late 60's, 1976, 1988, etc.) and random unrelated/disconncted scenes (like one scene of Michael taking his daughter to Neustadt [his childhood hometown] out of the blue to visit his widowed mother).<br /><br />I found [[ASIN:B001VEE5KK The Reader]] to be a pretty confusing movie, and one of the few (or only, I think) Holocaust movies that I've seen that I did not neither enjoyed (as much as one can enjoy a Holocaust movie) nor find informative in the slightest.<br /><br />Although would NOT say that \\"The Reader\\" is a BAD movie, it definitely is NOT that great, nor worthy of all the good reviews & 5-star ratings on here! :(eader\\" is a BAD movie, it definitely is NOT that great, nor worthy of all the good reviews & 5-star ratings on here! :(

B0006J28MI|5.0|Richie Rich, starring Macaulay Culkin (of \\"Home Alone\\" fame), Edward Herrmann (of \\"Gilmore Girls\\"), Christine Ebersole, and John Larroquette, is a sweet family-friendly movie based on classic comic-book (and cartoon) character, by the same name, that is suitable for ALL ages from young children to even non-judgmental adults!<br /><br />I was in high school when \\"Richie Rich\\" first came out in 1994, and I LOVED it back then and still (more than 15 years later) love it now, as a 30-something! Granted, I may be biased, because I'm a HUGE kid at heart (or \\"kid-ult\\", as its been called) & still LOVE many things that are typically considered for children (like classic animated Disney movies, vintage 80's toys,  family-friendly [some may say lame/cheesy] movies, etc.) but I think that \\"Richie Rich\\" is one of the few movies out there that TRANSCENDS the age gap.<br /><br />Richard \\"Richie\\" Rich Jr.(played by Macaulay Culkin) is the world's wealthiest kid, the likable but isolated only child of multi-billionaires Richard (Edward Herrmann) Rich, a tycoon worth $70 billion, and his wife, Regina (Christine Ebersole) Rich. Richie has been raised having everything that money can buy (literally EVERYTHING, including his own McDonalds at home, his own roller-coaster, his face on a \\"Mount Richmore\\" mountain and more!), but with only loyal butler Herbert Cadbury as a companion. In terms of material goods, Richie has anything & everything he wants. But he does not have the one thing that money can never buy - real friends.<br /><br />Richie is lonely and wants friends who accept him for who he is and have the time to just hang out, and have fun like kids. He tries to make friends with his rich snobby classmates, but they have no time for him and are too busy trying to get even richer, to care about just hanging out & having fun. He then thinks he might get his chance to make friends. when, at a dedication for the reopening of the \\"United Tool\\" factory, a factory his dad, Richard Rich Sr., recently bought (with the intention of modernizing it & then giving it away to the employees as a token of goodwill) he meets a group of kids (and the children of the United Tool employees) playing baseball in a sandlot near the factory & tries to befriend them, but that doesn't go so well either................at least at first.<br /><br />But Richie will need the help of these friends when the scheming villain of \\"Richie Rich\\", the greedy CFO of Rich Industries, Laurence Van Dough, who opposes all of the Rich family's charitable donations/spending (like giving away the United Tool factory to the employees, for example), and with the help of Ferguson, who is also Richie's too-strict (but clearly with ulterior motives) bodyguard, plots to kill off the entire Rich family with a bomb (disguised as a present to the Queen of England) planted on board their plane, and steal the Rich financial fortune, by plundering the the family vault that Richard has made vague references to, and which Van Dough, believes contains all the wealth of the Rich family.<br /><br />The real test of friendship comes when Richie's new friends are forced to put themselves (and their lives) on the line to help save Richie and his parents from the evil Laurence Van Dough & Ferguson - and Richie learns whether or not he really has the one thing money can never buy..................true friends.<br /><br />Richie Rich is a good clean movie that has no (or an amount so minimal, it passed my notice) swearing, or foul language, no graphic sexual scenes (other than kiss[es] between married couple) and no gratuitous violence, though there are scenes with guns, shooting & violence, it is  not graphic (like some other movies out there), is in a context of the plot, and is the family-friendly depiction, tempered for the youth audience. Even the scenes with violence are NOT overly scary (no more than the scenes with the villains of animated Disney movies) and after watching it again this morning, morethan 15 years after the first time I saw it (though I have watched it from time to time over the intervening years) I enjoyed it just as much now as a 30-something, as I did as a teen high-schooler in 1994!!<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE!!hough I have watched it from time to time over the intervening years) I enjoyed it just as much now as a 30-something, as I did as a teen high-schooler in 1994!!    GREAT MOVIE!!

1400049628|4.0|The Zombie may be gone, but the threat lives on...<br /><br />This month I've been in a bit of a Zombie kick, so I'm going to review two books by Max Brooks, First the Zombie Survival Guide, a non-nonsense guide to surviving a world teeming with zombies (fictionally, of course...right?) Then in a few days I'll be reviewing World War Z, Max Brooks' semi-biographical/fictional oral account of the Zombie War.<br /><br />To  begin, the Zombie Survival Guide is just that - a survival guide. After providing a solid background on the myths and truths of zombies, zombie infestation, the differences between Hollywood depictions and the real McCoy, we learn about the four classes of outbreaks, and their impact on society. I liked this part. Other zombie guides discuss weapons and tactics and ways of working together, but scarcely do they provide clues about how a zombie infestation might be covered up by authorities (Be on the look out for missing people and heavily armed \\"rescue\\" teams). Brooks informs us of in-depth studies performed on Zombies, what works against them, what doesn't, all combined with useful diagrams and drawings showing how to defeat, or get eaten, by Zombies.<br /><br />A few quick glimpses of the most useful things gleaned from this treasure trove of information compiled by Brooks.<br /><br />1. The most useful protection against zombie bite is not Kevlar or plate mail armor, but rather close cropped hair and tight clothing (Think nothing to grab)<br /><br />2. The best close combat weapon? Trench Spike (WW1 Trench Warfare Spear/Brass knuckle combo)<br /><br />3. Best Long Range Weapon? Not a machine gun or flame thrower, but a semi-automatic rifle. Avoid the run n' gun approach!<br /><br />Other awesome parts to read up on - What to do in an outbreak, preparedness, and, most importantly, a Checklist for Survival. Read up on the famous accounts of zombie attacks, the humans who fought them, and the outcomes. With events stretching as far back as 60000 B.C., Zombies have been attacking, infesting, fighting, and disappearing back into the wilderness of Earth. Are you prepared for them?

1423113381|5.0|I'm a big fan of the percy jackson series and I have to say I really loved this book.  It had a nice pace and a much better pay off in action at the end.  In scope of action I put it on the level with the last of the percy jackson series.  Highly recommended
B0018J48QO|5.0|I've loved this show from season 1.  It was of no surprise to me that season 2 turned out to be, just as great as season 1. Michael C. Hall is dynamic as Dexter a blood spatter analysis, who moonlights at night as a serial killer. Season 2 begins with the aftermath of the Ice Truck killer, who Dexter discovers in season 1, is his brother Brain. Dexter is riddled with grief over having to kill his brother, to save his sister Debra, who was dating Brain. We find Debra finding her way back emotionally, after having lived through her boyfriend Brain's attempt to murder her. Deb is a emotionally devastated until FBI special agent Lundy, enters her life and helps her to restore peace, strength, and sanity back to her life. Doak's is still Dexter's Achilles  heel and arch enemy. Rita finds strength following her ex-husband Paul's tragic end while behind bars. Rita fed up with the bad choices she consistently makes with the men she dates, gives Dexter an ultimatum- \\"get help for your addiction, or you can't be apart of my life.\\" Dexter relents and begins attending recovery meetings where he meets a women by the name of Lila, who seems to get him and see him for who is really is.<br />LaGuerta, finds herself demoted for the Ice Truck killings, and vows to take back her position as head chief, and she succeeds. Season 2 was a exhilarating ride form episode one to the season finale. There were many twists and turns with each scene that led to a exciting and heart pounding end. Dexter is hands down one of the best shows on Showtime.
B003F3NE1Q|1.0|Te collection arrived in good time and I was happy to get to watch the whole 6´th season. But then disappointed, because my computer didn´t play any of the cd´s. I tried them in a dvd player too, but still not working. A month later I bought a new set, twice the price but at least this one worked. Grey´s Anatomy rocks!

B002ZOHVN8|4.0|It's been almost two years since this album came out and after finding myself listening to it earlier today I had to put my two cents in on this one. Some fans had a problem with this album because of the synths and electronic sound. The thing is, the songs are still very much Editors - just in a different flavor. The best analogy I can make is when Canadian rock gods rush started dabbling in synths in the 1980s. At first fans were shocked, but now albums like Moving Pictures, Power Windows and Grace Under Pressure are considered classics. I think it's the same thing here. This is possibly Editor's strongest album to date as far as the ratio of good songs to bad songs. Only one or two songs could be considered weak in my book, and even those may grow on some people. However, if you're one of those people that hate when bands like Keane or Muse start experimenting and making albums that didn't sound like all their previous albums, I guess you can always go back and listen to The Back Room over and over again. I would just feel a bit sorry for you if you did.
0061801313|5.0|Love the show! Love the books! There are quite a few differences between the two which for certain characters was a little irritating to me at first, but I really do enjoy the books, they're filled with a lot more detail than the show

1599219751|5.0|A friend gave me a copy of this book to read and for some reason I stuck it on a shelf where it stayed for a year. I just finished it in two days. I couldn't put it down and now I'm going to order a bunch of copies to give to others. It's an amazing story of human suffering, human cruelty,the human capacity to love and give, and the will to live. I could go on and on. Just read it.
1439177783|5.0|Not only did it scream truth, beauty and pain all in one package, it also allowed recognition of things that society has taught to remain taboo. It is a truly heart wrenching, truth delivering story of a wonderful human being who has seen too many battles between herself and those around her, and the pain and anguish that is forced upon us for being 'different'. Being able to experience the journey from her being in a darkened place, to then growing into an insightful person and achieving self love and self respect is magnificent. Anyone who has had troubles with mental illness, 'coming out' or self esteem troubles would find this easy to relate to, and shed some tears and laughter as it rings true and realise we are never alone.    Brilliant read, and a ten out of 10.
0307272702|5.0|Gary Taubes presents an utterly provocative and entirely convincing explanation of why we get fat. Contrary to established wisdom on this subject, which is that obesity results from a caloric imbalance and a sedentary lifestyle, Taubes argues that fat accumulation is triggered primarily by the consumption of one particular kind of food: carbohydrates. Consumption of carbs, whether in the form of sugary or grain-based products (which includes a significant proportion of our modern diet, such as bread, pasta, cakes and cookies, etc.) causes our body to release insulin, which in turn signals organs and cells to store fat instead of releasing it into the bloodstream to be consumed. In this scenario, overeating and a sedentary lifestyle are symptoms rather than causes of obesity: as fat accumulates in the body, the brain creates hunger pangs in order to procure calories to sustain the increase in body mass, and at the same time discourages intense activity for the same reason. In other words, fat people overeat because they are fat. While this may sound counterintuitive, it is backed up by a lot of solid research.<br /><br />The road ahead is clear, then: in order to get lean we must minimize our consumption of carbohydrates. While this might seem incredibly restricting, in another sense it is also liberating: haven't we all been frustrated by complicated diets where we have to try to maintain some optimal ratio of carbs to fats to proteins? If Taubes is correct, all we have to do is cut out breads, starches and sugars, leaving us free to eat tasty food like meat, eggs and cheese to our heart's content. This book provided just the blueprint I needed to jump-start my own fat loss. My thanks to Gary Taubes for presenting his groundbreaking research in such a clear, accessible narrative.
0525421580|1.0|My partner and I feel betrayed and mistreated by the authors.  What we bought as a gay romance has turned into cyberbullying against us readers as well as a character.      It's not that we can't read books portraying nasty situations, but reading this book to each other we realized that we feel scammed by the authors.     The matter-of-fact acceptance of the cyberbullying is unacceptable.  Talented writers would find a way to explore the cyberbullying without belittling the victim.    We have wasted our quality time and emotions on reading aloud up to page 131.  Now we are putting the book in paper recycling so that nobody else will have the bad experience we have just had.
1439152780|3.0|Kate Morton does her best to write the updated Gothic novel plugging in the typical variables into a well-used and beloved formula that usually yields a great deal of entertainment and quality reading time for those of us who enjoy the genre.  In this case, a moldering castle, a trio of spinster sisters and a secret help to create atmosphere while a letter written back in 1941 and finally delivered in 1997 jumpstarts a flailing mother/daughter relationship while uncovering some unsettling facts about the origins of a children's literary classic.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"The Distant Hours,\\" Morton's third foray into this type of romance, works as an entertainment, meaning that it succeeds in whiling away the time of its audience in a way that both engages and has them desiring more.  However, Morton's labyrinthine style of telling stories within stories while changing point of view and time periods begins to get cumbersome after the reader figures out where the plot is actually going and that the overall effect on the main characters really isn't all that critical.<br /><br />One of the main characters, Meredith, comes to the castle as a child evacuated during the bombing of London during WW2.  Morton introduces us to her personal angst with regard to her view of her own self-worth and the role the castle-dwelling sisters play in helping her determine her future.  But for the most part, inasmuch as Meredith only serves as a technical vessel to change the novel's venue to the castle, none of this has any great dramatic relevance that later on will cause the reader to ooh and ahh when the climatic scenes are reached and the mystery is no longer shrouded in secret.<br /><br />Likewise, Edie, Meredith's daughter, the primary narrator of the tale, and the person whose actions somewhat drive the plot, really gains nothing from the whole experience recanted in over 500 pages.  She begins as a storyteller and ends as pretty much the same personality with perhaps a better understanding of her mother as a person with desires of her own.  As charming as all this bonding sounds, Morton's effort comes across as forced.  She has all the components for a modern story told on fairytale turf--the woods, the castle, two Red Riding Hoods and three undernourished grandmothers.  Unfortunately, her wolf is tired and dentures facilitate his bite. Present throughout the story as a legend, he seems to be added to the mix a tad too late at the point where the reader has already decided where and how the story should have ended and doesn't really care about the meandering back story told by way too many voices.<br /><br />In the same respect, Morton's hunter remains non-existent: the hero of \\"the Distant Hours\\" is suggested as an afterthought rather than crafted through the thunder and lightning of human chemistry and moonlit nights. Where is the romance? The suggestion of sensual pleasure breaking through the barrier of the classic Gothic heroine's intellectual sensibilities is sadly never explored and this very necessary flare of hope and light in the midst of all the gloom never illumed.  In attempting to recreate a neo-Gothic drama, Morton needs to look to past experts:  the first person voices of Victoria Holt's heroines--who acted for me as initial welcomers to the suspense/romance/Gothic world and now presently, the women crafted by Susanna Kearlsey whose modern day narratives brings the heroine into her own, unencumbered by convention and class distinctions.  Morton's damsel, who cannot be qualified as even \\"in distress\\" remains a voyeur like Bronte's Lockwood in [[ASIN:1936041588 Wuthering Heights]].  She watches and reports; the reader can only guess at her emotional station as the narration comes to an end.  We may feel her pleasure that the book has come to a conclusion and all is well with the world, but as the wolf has no teeth, the maybe lovers, living happily ever after, have no heat.<br /><br />For Morton, a theme revolving arounda piece of literature and the backstory of its creation is already explored in her \\"[[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]].\\"  That story works better as the characters of TFG are all personally invested in the mystery's solution--lives are dramatically changed, bitterness abandoned and burgeoning love blossoms sweetly like lilies of the valley in Springtime.  \\"The Distant Hours\\" goes out with not so much name-dropped T.S. Eliot's whimper, but a drama-less fizzle--Morton makes a sloppy attempt to make all things right with her fictional world--she provides the outlines, brings her audience to a premature denouement and then attempts to fully flesh out her sketch afterwards when I, for one, no longer cared.<br /><br />Bottom line?  \\"The Distant Hours\\" does provide the Gothic romance reader a glorious amount of time whiled away back in the day where crumbling castles and those of the manor born ruled their roasts and controlled each other and their annexed village.  Alas, with no Byronic hero and little in terms of romance, \\"The Distant Hours\\" flounders a little, meandering down a path strewn with too many spinsters and would-be governesses that dead ends into the depressing debilitating corner of crushed dreams.  All in all, it is recommended because of its ability to create a thoroughly chilling atmosphere and for the fact that it attempts to further along the neo-Gothic genre that since the retirement of Victoria Holt, Dorothy Eden and Mary Stewart has floundered for a new voice.  Check out the novels of Susanna Kearlsey if you enjoy a modern heroine in a not-so-modern environment.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"tory of its creation is already explored in her \\"[[ASIN:1416550550 The Forgotten Garden: A Novel]].\\"  That story works better as the characters of TFG are all personally invested in the mystery's solution--lives are dramatically changed, bitterness abandoned and burgeoning love blossoms sweetly like lilies of the valley in Springtime.  \\"The Distant Hours\\" goes out with not so much name-dropped T.S.

0316743003|5.0|This is an excellent, readable account of the secret products of the Lockheed aircraft company during the post-WW2 era.  The development of the U-2, SR-71 and F-117 is detailed.  Especially interesting is the account of the development of stealth technology.  The book reads like a Tom Clancy novel, but is better because it is real.  Anyone who is \\"into\\" aircraft or technology will enjoy this book.  The portrait of Clarence \\"Kelly\\" Johnson is outstanding!  Read it.
B003EYVXT6|2.0|Everybody already knows the formula. Everybody already knows it's going to happen. Pretty good idea of who the good guys and bad guys are. Yet some of us watch this to see if there's going to be anything different. Others watch this because it is the same and they can never get enough.<br /><br />A couple of renegade geneticists (Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley) crossed the line and splice with human DNA (Delphine Chaneac.) They pretend they don't know what they're doing. Just a little harmless investigation beyond what is allowed. What can be the harm in that? You and I know that how long does it take them to know?<br /><br />It doesn't take exceptional CGI to make this movie. The scenes were all shot in Canada, so there may be an interest in this movie by Canadians. The pacing is quite good; the spooky parts go fast and the anticipation parts drag out.<br /><br />Only subassembly race I can't tell you about any other versions. I did not see any extras but what do you need in making this movie. I would just chalk this up as a chiller, thriller, and filler.
1401324029|4.0|As the second book of the series it is a quick formulaic read. I won't give away any plot points but it does follow the same track as the first book. There is competent writing, the characters are predictable and the extra pages give more time to play out the plot and let the protaganists banter and solve the case. I enjoyed this volume but I may wait to get the third book used.

B002ZG98PA|5.0|When I first saw the preview for this movie in theaters, months ago, within 15 seconds of viewing, I brushed it off and dismissed it as another princess movie, no different than the other zillion princess movies Disney's made.... Beautiful girl needs rescuing from evil mother, handsome man saves her, love prevails. Yawn.  I had completely forgotten about it until my brother invited me to watch it with him in theaters yesterday. Reluctantly, I agreed to go. On the way to the theater, I was skeptical. In line buying tickets, I was skeptical. Sitting in the theater watching previews, I was skeptical.  And then the movie started. And no matter how hard I tried to hate it, I couldn't. 'Tangled' was amusing right from the beginning, with a witty introduction shortly followed by colorful, catchy singing, realistic characters, a hilarious horse, and a self-righteous but sweet chameleon. The last 15 minutes were absolutely perfect, with surprising strength of emotion.   All in all, I was very impressed and would recommend it not only to children, but any adult who loves music, singing, Disney, or all of the above.

I have to say that the initial food choices are very limited, but the steady weight loss makes it tolerable. The best part is that unlike other diets we have been on, I have been keeping up with the weight my husband is losing, usually he loses alot and I hardly lose anything. Be sure to read the book, it really helps, don't just wing it.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wasn't expecting much for less than ten bucks. I just ordered this to push another order above $25, hoping I'd get lucky. And I did get lucky, this is a pretty nice gadget. The ceramic \\"stones\\" helped me refresh the straight edge on my everyday pocketknife, and the carbides successfully brought back the edge on an old knife I'd decimated a while back. The slots are simple to use, just apply some pressure and draw the blade through. The package has instructions printed on it.    The diamond coated rod, though, is sort of awkward. It's hard to sharpen any serration that's not an exact match for the diameter of the rod, so it's a good thing serrations stay sharp longer than straight edges.
B0042MEQVG|3.0|I want to preface this review by saying, I love the Twilight series.  I enjoyed both of the first movies despite the fact I could see problems with both--more Twilight than New Moon.  I waited anxiously for the DVD to be released like every Twilight fan.  We put the movie in to watch and within 5 minutes I was bored.  The scenes are short and seem to be cobbled together--there is no flow.  It seems stilted.  I kept having to explain things to my husband because they chose little snippets of dialogue from the book, but put them in inappropriate places with no foundation.  It just seems that if one hadn't read the book, the movie would make little sense.  I'll watch it again because I do enjoy the characters, but with the material available in the book, this movie could have been so much  better.<br /><br />I am hoping Breaking Dawn is better
B000148KK2|2.0|How the heck did Diana Krall ever have a singing career let alone be the top-selling jazz vocalist in recent years?  She's awful!  She comes in with these low, soft vocals like she's in a cigar store, but the truth is she sings flat off key; she's weak, lacks body, and can't even find her own pitch.  And, it's great that there's such an excellent production on this CD, \\"The Girl in the Other Room,\\" but the voice of Mickey Mouse would've been more interesting.  She can't hit a note to save her life.  Why can't she take some singing lessons?  The small but excellent band along with the CD's excellent recording brings out every lacking thing about Ms. Diana Krall.  Maybe she's good for people who have no ear for tone and don't know what a well-trained voice will sound like.  Her success is good for the money, and so she gets produced.  She lacks even the natural ability some of today's pop singers seem to possess without much formal training.  Krall seems to have no interest in voice education; her wimpy voice agitates like the grinding of metal.<br /><br />Also, who is she to sing jazz?  Who's her audience?  Maybe she gets marketed well.  I just don't get her success from what she does as \\"stylish.\\"  Popularity doesn't mean critically good.  While some singers may not have all the training one would hope, she's just awful.  Why is a white Canadian blonde singing an American art like this in the first place?  How do her consumers justify her (other than general insanity, I mean)?  Does she come from an economically-impoverished background?  Does she have some connection to the civil rights movement?  What does she know about the blues?  Apparently she just likes Edward G. Robinson on a bridge on a foggy night--film noir.  So what of it?  Krall is a joke.  She hasn't a fiber of anything even resembling Julie London.  Whenever I listen to her, I find myself getting angry and saying, \\"Why doesn't she cut out the cinematics and just sing the song?\\"  I don't think that's possible.  She also makes frequent mistakes playing the piano as well.  She should take some college courses in Communications.  Musicians other than Diana Krall of this disc: Five-Star Rating.  Diana Krall: One Star!She also makes frequent mistakes playing the piano as well.  She should take some college courses in Communications.

B004498KPU|1.0|I was excited about buying this and all set to make my purchase, and then I learned from other reviewers that it is both incomplete and of poor quality.  Someone who knows how, please contact both Sony and the estate administrators.  Tell them people like me want to support the estate's efforts, but I am not buying crap just because they slap Michael Jackson's name on it.  Tell them to make it complete -- as they promised, improve the quality -- as they promised, provide a genuine \\"hard-bound\\" book -- as they promised (instead of cardboard), and get rid of that black box people are complaining about.  I want to view this on my laptop.  I have no intention of purchasing a wide-screen TV.  This is unbelievable and inexcusable.  Lies, deceit, done on the cheap.  Sony, you have no respect for Jackson's fans, and you will be rewarded with poor sales for your lousy, deceitful, greedy effort.  The suits at Sony can stop licking their chops at all the money that will flow in -- you won't get one cent of mine until you fix this mess and advertise that you've done so.

B000002J1B|4.0|What a breath of fresh air \\"Relayer\\" is. Not only does this album represent the  bookend to previous albums \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans,\\" it allowed Yes to flex its considerable musical muscle. With this outing, we are introduced to a band whose curiosity is only matched by their fearlessness. The payoff for the listener is a great album.    \\"Relayer,\\" in the style of CTTE, offers a long form composition followed by two shorter songs. It can be seen as a journey, and a dymnamic one at that, in terms of the album overall and each individual track. This wasn't an easy feat with the departure of longtime keyboardist Rick Wakeman. Still, Yes forged ahead undaunted.    The success of \\"Relayer\\" can be attributed to newly hired keyboardist Patrick Moraz. Sadly, this is the only studio album to feature Moraz on keys. Yet, the new life he breathed into Yes resulted in an exploration into new territory.     On the album's lead track, \\"The Gates of Delirium,\\" Yes spans the spectrum between urgent, raucous, victorious and serene. The end in particular, \\"Soon\\" shows the most maturity and beauty in the band's writing. Jon Anderson also delivers one his finest vocals here.      Jazz and funk elements are most evident on the ambitious second track, \\"Sound Chaser.\\" Alan White's drumming is tight, furious and masterful. Steve Howe and Chris Squire (guitar and bass respectively) are given the unenvialbe task of keeping up with White's drumming, but do so brilliantly while offering what may be arguably their best guitar and bass work. \\"To Be Over\\" provides a gracious, gentle and uplifting end to the album.    This album marked an end for Yes as they would abandon the long form concept in favor of shorter songs with more of a rock feel. By the time of this album's release, the band had endured four member changes. To weather so many losses in personalities without it hindering their musical output demonstrates how incredible Yes was as a band. \\"Relayer\\" may not be of the same caliber as \\"Fragile\\" or CTTE, but it is strong and very listenable.

0307272702|5.0|First, this is not a diet book. The author does include several pages that could get you started. However, your best bet before actually starting the eating plan would be to read a book the author recommends: \\"The New Atkins for a New You,\\" by Eric Westman, M.D., Stephen D. Phinney, M.D., and Jeff S. Volek, Ph.D.    What author Taubes does in his book \\"Why We Get Fat and What to Do About It\\" is give a lot of important information--much of it very involved and detailed--for those who need more to decide to go to low-carb eating.     This book is not an easy read. It is an important read, but may be too difficult for some individuals. Should not be too difficult for doctors, though, and they ALL need to read it.    I went on Atkins in 2002 and lost 181 pounds in 21 months. I had lost 100 pounds twice previously in my life, but it came back, plus more. This book explains why that happens to virtually everyone who loses weight on a low-CALORIE diet, without lowering their carbohydrate intake. Having been there and done that, I know what he is talking about!    I also understand what he said about keeping the weight off once you lose it on low-carb. It's now late 2010, and I have kept the weight off all this time.    I am not the only one who has done this! There are many people who have. And doctors are more and more directing patients to try low-carb. This book will help those doctors greatly. It doesn't take too long to read, so the doctors can read it. I fervently hope they will.    I have read a lot about low-carb, and it is complicated. I learn something here and something there, it all adds up, and I am able to make adjustments as needed to keep the weight off.     If you want to go onto low-carb eating, be sure to read \\"The New Atkins for a New You.\\" It will tell you clearly how to do it.    If you have heard and read things that make you suspicious of going to low-carb eating, be sure to read Why We Get Fat. Preferably read carefully before you start your new eating plan. It works best if you do as I did: go on it and stay 100% on it, permanently. Going on and off causes problems and reduces your chances of doing well on it.     This book is highly recommended!

B00129H7VS|5.0|I've owned this on vhs, owned it on dvd, and now own this on blue ray for about a couple of months.  I had seen it so many times that I just had to get it on blue ray, a one day sale that had it bundled with the first episode of pacific for $37(I won't buy the pacific till its dirt cheap cause of the one sided blame america theme, and not on my must have list), so I bought band of brothers blue ray immediately, and point being is I watch my emails regularly for amazon's one day sales, or super sales, I mean, I've gotten in on so many 60% off sales, case in point again last year I got in on the complete \\"Combat\\" with Vic Morrow from the sixties on dvd for just a $130, a wonderful show that I won't ever need in blue ray.  I don't want to get every last movie and show on blue ray, and I won't, just a select few.    The transfers to blue ray are nice and clear, there is some intentional grany shots, or shots and scenes that couldn't be made crystal clear in low light back then, that is to be expected.  The sound really is alot better than dvd seemingly, kind of made me jump many times.  The extras are something I haven't explored as of yet, I'm a blue ray newbie anyway.  Mainly though, if you think you've really seen it too many times already, then you are like me and have, just see it again in blue ray if you can afford it or don't have to spend too much.  Ha, far better than the vhs set I bought a long time ago and still own, back when all I had was a vcr and a tv from the mid nineties, and one of those signal clarifyers that improved signal between vcr and 75 owm connector on the tv.  I did notice for all those thinking about buying a blue ray copy that the BoB blue ray packaged with the part one of the Pacific is still regularly cheaper than just the blue ray BoB package alone.

B002ZG999U|1.0|THis movie is so bad, and not in  good bad way. Hey I have a soft spot for a well done bad movie. This is just painful. This is so bad even the sound track is bad. The acting is horrible, these guys can do better, they just didn't. The screen play is bad and the dialouge is so bad it should be outlawed as torture by Amnesty International.    Just please watch paint dry for a couple of hours, it will be time better spent.
B0041T52S6|4.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a very fun movie to watch. I'm a big fan of Bryan Lee O.Malley's original comic and while there are a bunch of changes from the source material (they started filming half-way through the comic run), director Edgar Wright (of tv's excellent 'Spaced') manages to capture a lot of it's original charm. Unfortunatly as a film some of this material doesn't hold together as well as it should.<br /><br />The Story of 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' revolves around title character Scott, a slacker in his early twenties who's dating 17 year old Knives Chau and ends up falling in love with Ramona Flowers (who's closer to his own age). Ramona however comes with baggage: seven evil ex's who Scott has to defeat if he wants to date her. The movie itself plays out in a sort of video game styled world with levels, character stats and warp zones. To defeat Ramona's ex's Scott actually fights them hand-to-hand in a fighting game style fashion and wins coins and levels for each one defeated. While it's never clear if this is all happening inside Scott's head or this is some weird video game world these characters inhabit it all plays out in a way that's easy to follow. Unfortunatly this gimmick does wear out it's welcome as fights become more and more repentative (with the exception of the Katayanagi twins which plays out amid a battle of the bands as a giant monster fight) and the movie stops being engaging. Also a lot of the development of the side characters is dumbed down to cheap jokes (Wallace's sleeping around, Kim's passive aggressivness towards Scott, Neil's self-acceptance).<br /><br />While the film does start to slowly loose it's steam, the likability of the cast really keeps most of it afloat. Michael Cera gives his usual uncomfortable twist on Scott Pilgrim, and while he and Mary Winstead (as Ramona) have zero chemistry they remain likeable and watchable. The other actor's are also very well chosen but it's really Ellen Wong as Knives and Kieran Culkin as Scott's witty roommate Wallace who steal the show. The more well-known actors playing the ex's are a lot of fun expecially Chris Evans and Brandon Routh, but again despite some back-story are more or less given 'cameo' roles than actual characters.<br /><br />Your liking to 'Scott Pilgrim versus The World' will no doubt depend on your liking and familiarity to video games and comic books. I think the movie is a lot of fun and being a video game fan and fan of the orignal comic I had to give this film four stars (though I know it probably only deserves three).tt's witty roommate Wallace who steal the show.

0307454541|4.0|I was interested in reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo since many people love it, including quite a few of my teachers, but now that I've read it I kind of wish I hadn't. The main character, Mikael Blomkvist, isn't a very interesting character in my opinion. Lisbeth Salander, the other main character, is very intriguing, but unfortunately we don't hear very much about her for a while.<br /><br />For approximately the first 200 pages (of the paperback edition), we are introduced to too many characters and not much happens. There are a lot of scenes involving drinking coffee and eating strange, open-faced sandwiches, but that's about it. I never start reading a book and give up on it, so I painfully trudged through many dry, averagely written pages.<br /><br />Things start getting interesting only when we fully enter Lisbeth's point of view, which takes quite a while. She's a very quirky, tough girl who knows a lot about computers and has a photographic memory. Approximately the final third of the book is interesting, solely because of Lisbeth. It was interesting enough for me to want to read the other 2 books.<br /><br />There are some violent and sexual parts of this book that make me wonder why it is so popular. The more I thought about it, I realized the main reason it became so popular is probably because Larsson died before the books were published, giving them a certain appeal.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't much of a fan of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, but the last portion convinced me to read the other books. I've certainly read many other books that are much more interesting and better written, and I'd suggest the authors Harlan Coben or Ted Dekker for mysteries/thrillers with some humor. If you like thrillers and want to know what the hype is about over this book, I'd suggest reading it, even though it isn't the best that's out there.
0882709194|1.0|I dislike a book that deceive. This book does it big-time. There is no warning for consumer to read on the front and back pages of the book to decide if it's worth buying. In the end, this book contained the introductory part that really brought-down the rating for the book (not to mention, killing the intention of the title \\"The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin\\". THIS IS LOUSY & DECEPTIVE BOOK. SHAME ON THE PUBLISHER FOR USING CHARLES DARWIN'S NAME TO PROMOTE THIS BOOK. I WAS RIPPED-OFF!

B0000C8AW2|5.0|that the oringanal cd of this sounded so bad. It was my favorite album when I was in collage, A friend gave me a guitair speaker and I hooked up the record player to that- but when I started listening to music on a 5.1 system the sound on this cd was so bad it took me a song just to get adjusted to how much worse it sounded then my aveage cd. Then this came out and I rememberd why this was the greatest album of all time to me. Its best taken on a Saturday night after 10 p.m. with a bottle of wine and maybe a :\\"cigarette\\". Whoever said giving up the love that defines the love that last forever is easyZ? Just stop crying already- lets just expend some goodwill and git on with our lives already. anyway the invisable me is clawing at the door and he wont go away so i think I better intrude.

His social skills are lacking, but he is the perfect modern day Sherlock Holmes.  If you are looking for the same type of character you've seen in old versions, you won't find it.  Whatson too is different than expected, but equally intriguing.  Can't wait for more episodes!

B000001DTM|4.0|If you read the reviews you'll notice that 'Achtung' is sort of a love-it-or-hate-it affair, with the camps split between old-schoolers who love 'Joshua' and back, and those who love 'Achtung' to the present.      Whatever.      What this album was and is: a band taking their signature sound and taking it on a 90° tangent.  What it was not: a Euro-tech-industrial 'reinvention.'  Same themes as before, same talent, same blues, same soul.      I admit I was challenged by this post-'Rattle' record when in dropped in 91, but then the video/single for \\"the Fly\\" laid the groundwork for new horizons. Those who watched \\"the Fly\\" were duly warned.    View 'Achtung Baby' as \\"pivotal\\" in the lexicon if you must... but with all talk aside, this album contains the gem that is \\"One,\\" an example of pure songwriting craft that surpasses any predecessor in the catalogue.  That level of craft has only been equalled since by one other song: \\"Moment of Surrender\\" from 'No line on the Horizon.'
1599219751|5.0|This is a true story about seven men that escape a Russia Gulag, located deep in Siberia. They plan the escape well, but cannot imagine the arduous road that lays ahead. The lack of food and fatigue are enemies of the struggle. At times, they become guests of the indigenous people and are treated kindly, over the one year, 4,000 mile journey; from the bitter cold of Siberia, over the scorching heat of the Gobi Desert, and again into the bitter-cold crossing of the Himalayas to India.<br /><br />Along the way a young woman running from a local situation joins the group. Of interest is how very little they eat and drink, walking, twenty or thirty miles every day. Sadly, several die along the way.<br /><br />The book is professionally written, from dictation of one of the survivors and very enjoyable. I definitely recommend it.
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Nicki Minaj's debut album [[ASIN:B0042RUMEQ Pink Friday]] has the distinction of being the most anticipated album by a female MC in - well - like forever!  Minaj has smartly positioned herself (after being discovered by Lil Wayne years ago) smartly in the music business as a `new breed' of rappers that have redefined and almost revised the sound and climate of hip-hop. Minaj is schizophrenic in her hip-hop style - going from extremes of being unabashedly hardcore and then in the next breath being a hybrid R&B singer incorporating pop into her arsenal.  All said and done, most prefer the blunt Minaj to the softer side, but as Pink Friday shows, a mix of both can work well.  Pink Friday is a decent, though not valedictory debut, but it does reenergize the female MC hip-hop base, which is admirable.  Where Pink Friday could have been `tightened' might have been a few less `pop' cuts in favor of more raw cuts that show off Minaj's manic side.<br /><br />\\"I'm The Best\\" opens up the album on a high note with bright sounding production work thanks to bright synthesized lines and solid drum programming.  The rap performance here by Minaj is top-rate.  She affirms her rap as the `sole' female MC when she shockingly raps that she is \\"... the best b---- doing it...\\" That's the Nicki we love.  \\"Roman's Revenge,\\" featuring Eminem is arguably the best cut from Pink Friday featuring one of Swizz Beatz's best production efforts since Jay-Z's \\"On To The Next One\\" ([[ASIN:B002OEWIQE The Blueprint 3 (Deluxe Edition with DVD)]]).  Minaj is as hard as ever (maybe too much so at times) and gives a very captivating, enthralling performance.  Face it, \\"ruh, ruh like a dungeon dragon\\" is certainly not normal hip-hop fodder.  As for Eminem,  he is much more twisted on his guest verse than he was on all of 2010's [[ASIN:B003KUSUG8 Recovery]].  A bit much? Maybe, but it reminds me of vintage Eminem with his twisted jokes and analogies.<br /><br />\\"Did It On'em\\" isn't bad and continues to exhibit a hardcore Nicki, which is positive. It is less satisfying than \\"I'm The Best\\" or \\"Roman's Revenge,\\" but still enjoyable.  \\"Right Thru Me,\\" more of an R&B/pop cut is enjoyable despite hanging up the MC'ing for a cut.  The hook is as catchy as anything else: \\"you see right thru me, how do y'all do that $%^^...\\" \\"Fly\\" features Rihanna (perhaps a reciprocated collaboration given that Minaj appears on \\"Raining Men\\" from [[ASIN:B00428ZRFE Loud]]), though the performance is not revolutionary or particularly magical.  Basically, it comes down to the fact at this point that \\"Roman's Revenge\\" set a `benchmark' for this effort and as solid as \\"Fly\\" is, or it's followup cut \\"Save Me,\\" they come slightly short of achieving that level.  \\"Save Me\\" is squarely and R&B track and it works well, but won't be on anybody top five list from this effort.  That said, \\"Save Me\\" is good for a couple of solid lines, particularly when Minaj states \\"It's not your fault I'm a b----, I'm a monster.\\"<br /><br />\\"Moment 4 Life\\" featuring Drake leads an upswing of first-rate material.  Here, the production work is solid with big hip-hop drums and face it, any track with Drake tends to be `hot.' \\"Check It Out\\" featuring and produced by will.i.am (of The Black Eyed Peas) allows Minaj to show off her manic side.  will.i.am obviously serves as a great collaborator with his wacky production ideas and his absurd rhymes.  On the Kanye West assisted Blazin' (samples \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\"), Nicki is as hard as ever and Mr. West is not too shabby himself with some clever lines.  The track is lengthy at five minutes, but enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />\\"Here I Am\\" is another collaboration with Swizz Beatz, though less effective than \\"Roman's Revenge.\\" \\"Dear Old Nicki,\\" produced by KANE is better, and possesses some great rhymes from the MC.  My favorite - \\"but you was underground and I was mainstream.\\" \\"Your Love\\" was a massive hit and here on Pink Friday, It feels NO different. With a smart sampling choice (\\"No More I Love You's\\"), Minaj blends hip-hop and pop sensibilities with perfect here, making this cut the `benchmark' for crossover success. \\"Last Chance\\" features the popular Natasha Bedingfield, but the collaboration is only lukewarm, not aided by the fact it follows the supremely popular and exceptional \\"Your Love.\\" Perhaps the inclusion of the manic, though unsuccessful buzz single \\"Massive Attack\\" featuring Sean Garrett may have served as a better closer.  That said, Natasha Bedingfield does achieve some nice soulful grit towards the end of the clunky cut.<br /><br />Overall, Pink Friday is a fine, if flawed debut.  It is not perfect, but it also is not merely average.  There are enough strong moments to weigh down weaker ones in my mind.  This does not kill the momentum supporting Minaj - it just gives this creative music force even more room to grow.  And face it - she's truly the ONLY female MC doing it.

B000063WDH|4.0|Imagine your typical, musically proficient guitarist/drummer combo being locked away in a dimly lit basement with only a pot of black coffee and 30 or so tattered old blues records for company.  Although it's safe to assume such creative processes stand far away from the real story behind the Big Come Up, it's still pretty difficult to overlook the obvious influences present.  Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Savoy Brown - you name it and it's probably here in some form or another.  Even the gritty, simplistic production job applied to the work contained within grabs the listener's attention in a certain visceral way that no perfectly polished contemporary album ever could.  Perhaps that's the real allure here - an unabashedly retro experience to be had amidst a sea of releases by other bands currently up to their ears in auto-tuned, overproduced commercial schlock.<br /><br />Take any number of those artists out for a listen, then be taken aback by the unapologetic imperfections found here in tracks like \\"Do the Rump\\", which sounds as if it might be missing a few notes off the main riff each time it comes back around. Not to mention all the songs included on the album stay short and sweet, averaging under 3 minutes a piece - just long enough for a quick fix before moving on to the next number. The boys even throw in a couple of mildly experimental quirks here and there, with \\"The Breaks\\" featuring a voice sample at the beginning instructing all of us to \\"lean forward...and listen with a sparkle in your eye, as though you might be thinking 'Gee - this is the most wonderful thing I ever heard in all my life',\\" which is immediately cut short by a blistering guitar crunch that might just jerk your eyes wide open exactly as described.  Elsewhere, the traditional \\"Leavin' Trunk\\" proves to be a definite highlight amongst the batch, somehow managing to keep fresh the tried and true 12 bar blues format after decades of ritual use and abuse by countless others.  In essence, that's what the entire Black Keys catalog thus far is all about, adapting the blues to its newest, most modern facet with all the fuzz and fervor of the genre's classic era.e, that's what the entire Black Keys catalog thus far is all about, adapting the blues to its newest, most modern facet with all the fuzz and fervor of the genre's classic era.

This was fun to read, very informative, very interesting, and well written.  Timing was also impeccable as towards the end of the book he was able relate to the recent global economic crisis.  I am a little surprised though that his faith in free market's ability to steer the financial industry clear of the kind of mess we are in today never seems to have been shaken.  As someone not trained in the field I can not say this book eanabled me to understand the chaotic world of modern finace clearly, but this is the closest I came probably.  Highly recommended.
0545140315|2.0|As the title says I wanted so badly to love this book. A girl who loves The Beatles and creates a \\"Lonely Hearts Club\\" hating boys?? The idea seems like a no miss! Unfortunately this book was so over the top, over dramatic and completely predictable, not to mention cheesy.     I just want to say now that no one has ever said or will ever say \\"What to the evs\\" its \\"Whatev\\" if anything...    I love The Beatles, I love them more than anything I have over 30 books about their career, about how they effect on society, about their music, about their lives, about everything so I was really, really excited when there was a book about someone who likes The Beatles and featured kids of \\"today\\" (I put this in quotes because of the \\"What to the evs\\" comment\\" liking The Beatles. I'm 24, I'm not ancient. I know a few things have changed since I was in high school but there is NOOO way that a club like The Lonely Hearts Club would and could ever exist. There were people my age in high school that had never heard of The Beatles. Not to mention the fact that they were too busy having sex with each other to want to give it up for some club.     Some reviewers have said that because there were curse words, I can think of two instances, that the book isn't appropriate for children. I'm sorry but that is not realistic. Kids in high school curse, even kids in elementary school curse. This book was just too immature, too unrealistic and too cheesy.     I actually completely got pissed off at the book for saying that Beatles tribute bands were not worthy of \\"true\\" Beatles fans attention. I'm sorry but I love Beatles tribute bands I've seen over 10 different Beatles tribute bands and those guys are awesome at what they do. Its harder to try to be someone else on stage and learn their quirks, voice and movements than it is to be your own artist. Especially good tribute bands like Rain, Fab Four, Liverpool Legends and so forth. I've toured with some of the bands even and I know the work thatgoes on behind the scenes and its not to be mocked. I almost stopped reading right then...    I gave this book 2 stars for a couple reasons, #1 because I actually finished the book. I only finished it because I truly believed it might have a good and unexpected ending. It did not. Fail.    #2 It featured The Beatles. I love The Beatles.     All in all I was greatly disappointed and bored almost out of my mind while reading. I hope someday someone can write a truly entertaining story featuring The Beatles.
B000001E8S|4.0|Zune kept giving me this album when I asked for more like Vitalic and Dan Deacon. I was confused when I put it on Smart DJ and it gives me all this U2? Now I find out it is a U2 album, and for all its contemporary feel and advanced use of recording techniques ala Brian Eno, this thing was recorded in 1995? Amazing.
1400079144|2.0|First half not bad and reasonably interesting.  Thereafter book seemed way overblown and particularly the last third which I thought was grossly contrived and tedious with characters acting in ways that defied any sense of reality ( notwithstanding the circumstances)  Got to be just plain stupid.  Felt I was being taken advantage of by the author and publisher.  Playing on past successes without delivering a fair return for the price of this product.
B0001XALTG|5.0|The title was my first reaction on seeing the film.  Outrageous, hysterical, and depressing.  Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, there's another reason to watch it again; the female lead is the actress now doing such as terrific job as Mrs. Schroeder in HBO's Boardwalk Empire.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|This doesn't make any sense that I loved the Bella character in the books but I simply cannot stand her as portrayed by Stewart.  She was okay in Twilight, even likeable but not here.  She's annoying and irritating and It's hard not to wonder why Jacob or Edward even want her. I was hoping they would go so far off script as to kill her.....and to add insult to injury, they re-cast the role of Victoria, stupid move.  On the plus side, Rosalie is terrific as is Jasper.  The backstories of the Cullen clan are so much more interesting than the Bella/Edward/Jacob barf fest.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|In \\"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\\" Nietzsche wrote \\"And man shall be that to overman: a laughingstock or painful embarrassment.\\" On the surface, Napoleon Dynamite is a silly high-school farce filled with two-dimensional cartoon characters. But its appeal surpasses. While no \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" (hence my four stars,) it is nothing less than a brilliant example of how detached humans can be from the reality of the world around them. Those who think they are in the know, such as the adult high-school kid Uncle Rico, or the \\"hot chick\\" Trisha, are illustrations of individuals still clearly detached from human emotions; therefore, they do not \\"get it.\\" They have created a \\"here-ness\\" based on external influences, not internal values.    Meanwhile, the dorky Napoleon struggles to understand his place in a reality that is perplexing and most rewarding when fantastical. He clearly has developed values \\"Plus you're like the only guy at school who has a mustache,\\" but he struggles to understand his place in the featureless Idaho pastureland, his only real world. It is a world largely devoid of external stimulation so he escapes into his world of Ligers. It is a world largely devoid of emotion let alone God, with one exception, the wondrous coupling of Napoleon's brother Kip and his on-line fling Lafawnduh. In them, we see even when detached in the real world, love can grow when itself is real.     At it's climax, Napoleon finds self-developmental breakthrough in creative expression, shocking those who did not \\"get it\\" and winning the admiration of those who do.    I recommend Napoleon Dynamite. You guys will have a killer time with it.

031603438X|5.0|This book was a delight to read as a Stones fan, a musician, and a true lover of music.  I found the whole process of song writing, using alternate guitar tunings and most of Life's experiences fascinating.  You truly feel like you get to know Keef along with his love train of thought.  You follow this soul survivor 2000 light years from home and through the past darkly at times not always on his side.  Everything from watching him & Mick grow apart as people to his love and care for family & dear friends.  This man has really led an amazing life.  Keith really drove himself to take advantage of every opportunity he had to become successful or to just enjoy himself and live life to the fullest.  Though reckless at times, he explains where he went wrong and how he looked after himself.  There is fun insight on how certain songs were written. The traveling he did through different countries to live and tour in.  His story keeps flowing from one interesting adventure to another. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to take a close look at the extraordinary life of rock n' roll.
B000IOUCO2|5.0|Barbara Tuchman was a journalist who taught herself to write history.  That classic journalistic training shows here, as she lets the sources speak for themselves without a thick layer of 20th century analysis over the story. At first glance, this seems to be a story of a French knight. But it soon emerges that de Coucy, as interesting as he is, is Tuchman's device to invite us into the entirety of Europe of the day.  Warfare, conflict with the Church, the Crusades and trade with the Islamic world, feudalism and its enemies in the bourgeois world of the cities are all explored in A Distant Mirror. Most importantly, Tuchman understands how to use her sources.  She cites innumerable primary sources within her text, and even more in her notes.  Her textual citations lend both weight and context to her story.  This is a must for anyone interested in the Middle Ages!
B0047HOXGY|1.0|I was reluctant to purchase this album due to helloweens other let downs after the old days(keeper of 7 keys etc). But after reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews that promise a heavier sound, I took the bait and I made a bad mistake.  I always knew that if a critic didnt like it then it was probably kick ass. but fans??? Well you cant trust fans either, because this is the worst album by far that ive bought in the last ten years.  HEAVY? I think not! If you like overuse of keyboards and tinny production, then this is the cd for you.  If you like drum heavy productions and strong vocals, then pass on this one.If you were disappointed in the direction helloween took after the late 80s and early nineties, this is exactly what you would expect, very unremarkable. I only give it one star because they dont give the option of zero or negative stars.  Shame on all of you fans that conned me into buying this crap.  ARE YOU METAL?  SADLY, NO HELLOWEEN, YOU ARE NOT!
B003INBOE2|4.0|This movie is one of the greatest martial arts movies I have seen in a while. Not since the first time I watched Ong Bak did I really enjoy a martial arts movie...    This bluray leaves alot to be desired though. The audio is suspect. I ignored the english dub (1/3) there are two ZHO DTS-HD multi-chi. (2/3) and (3/3).... What the difference is, I can't tell. But, then again I only speak english, maybe there is differences, I didnt pick up. The only thing I can say is the first ZHO option(2/3) the lips compared to dialogue is off way more than the second ZHO option.    The subtitle is worse. You are given two options. Both ENG 1/2 & 2/2 First of all 1/2 is non-existent. Nothing there.  2/2 is the only option in reality. The subtitle is suspect. Some words, I think are used wrong, please correct me if I am wrong.  But they just don't seem appropriate. In the first scene both Master Liu and Ip man say PLEASE, that is in the subtitle and the eng dubbed. So maybe I am incorrect. Secondly, when Ip Man fights Master Jin, the Subtitle says I'll PAY when he takes form. The ENG dub he says PLEASE. After ruining a vase he again says I'LL PAY. which makes more sense....   But like I said I might be mistaken, only speaking english.    Also, the video quality, is suspect. Visually the cinematragrahpy is great. But there is a couple instances of people ghosting or blurring when they move on screen.    Pick up the movie, its a great action film and story. just be aware of the inconsistencies...
B0041T52S6|5.0|My wife and I watched this together today and LOVE IT! I'm a gamer and she just happens to love Michael Cera. A great twist on an old story of love. It's the notebook for guys! A definite must see. You'll laugh over and over. I plan on watching this over and over for a long time to come.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|This is by far one of the best movie I have seen in a while. Chloe Grace Moretz gives one of the best performance I have seen from a young kid as well as Kodi Smit-McPhee. I loved this movie so much that I saw it 8 times in its short run in theaters. The 8th time was just as beautiful and entertaining as the first. If it was still out, I would definitely see it again. Can't wait for the Blu-ray to be released.
B0046IGOIO|5.0|I've had a 90 minute cassette of this show for a long time, and have been really hoping to have it in a more permanent medium.  I absolutely love the Petition the Lord With Prayer into Light My Fire.  This has been my favorite LMF since I first heard it.  The rest of the show does not impress me. I don't particularly care for the set list as it lacks any of the special songs that were rarely played (for example Ship of Fools or Blue Sunday from this time).  And frankly, though I respect the Doors' reinvigoration into the blues at this time, I may likely never play the Albert King stuff again. The other material is all conventional. The set list is a little disappointing for this time.  But I can't praise the Light My Fire enough. It smokes from start to finish.  I love Robbie's guitar solo ... love the Summertime quote ... and I love Jim's tangential forays into Summertime (completing Robie's thought?) and then right into St. James Infirmary.  What can I say? I listen to this sequence over and over now.  With regards to The End, which is what I always look for in a set, this one really doesn't distinguish itself. It's adequate, and I always enjoy hearing this signature tune, but don't expect to be blown away because it doesn't measure up to NYC Felt Forum or earlier Hollywood Bowl renditions.  BTW, does anyone know if the Isle of Wight version exists complete anywhere?  I absolutely love the few minutes that we get on the Message To Love movie about the festival. What a shame it's cut...
B00275EHJQ|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  It's funny and sentimental at the same time, and everyone with whom I have watched it has loved it!
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|I got the blu-ray/dvd combo pack so I could watch the movie on all my players including my phone.  In order to play it on my phone I have to convert it on my computer, but my HP Vista computer will not even read the DVD side or recognize that anything has been put into the drive.  My old Sony Vaio reads it fine but I don't have a DVD converter program on that and don't want to spend another $40 to get a license for one.  Not even sure the old Windows XP would work with the program.  The blu-ray is great, you can see every freckle, wrinkle, etc.  The movie itself is awesome as well, much better than New Moon (I am in the Edward camp and there was not much of Edward in New Moon).  But I am wishing I had just bought the single disc DVD and to heck with the blu-ray.  I paid more money for a product I can't use for the purpose for which it was purchased.  **UPDATE 12/21...After rebooting my pc a couple of times the DVD drive finally recognized the DVD side and I was able to convert it to my phone.  I can't help but think this is due to the 2 sided disc which means you always end up with fingerprints on a playing surface.  I don't think I will buy any single disc Blu Ray/DVD combos any more.
B003J27WFW|5.0|From the first time I heard Tom Sawyer on radio, I was hooked! This band's humility, humor, & compassion is unrivaled. I am proud to call myself a Rush fan. Anyone that has had the honor of embracing the professionalism of their music is truly lucky. Let's all do our best to represent this band as well as the three of them do. Long live the magic of RUSH!!!
B000001GYC|5.0|I heard samples of several pianists and I did like Barenboim the best.  Seems very much \\"chopin sounding\\" to me
B003NFM3JK|1.0|the most bizarre, unsettling Christmas movie I have ever seen.  After Carey did The Grinch I was expecting MUCH more than what I got.  This version is too scary for little kids and not worth your money. I wish I could return it.  It WAS THAT BAD.
B002ZG981E|2.0|The actual Blu-ray is nice ... the sound is exceptional and the blu-ray transfers is one of the better ones I've seen. the movie, however, is a less desirable. the script is convoluted, and the acting (except for the actress playing the wife) lacks any depth. I felt ellen page wasn't the best fit for this flick (i get she's us and her job is to push at the reality on our behalf)...there are moments that her character does things that seem not of her character, in the way that leo seemed to just walk through the role with a pinched look on his face. the train effect was alright not that spectacular...the movie homages (2001 et al) seems to exist in the film only to show the film makers ability to recreate the scenes and less with the story.
B001NLKWLW|2.0|While Kate Morton has a lovely way with words, I wish she had told the story with far fewer.  I found the format distracting.  Eliza`s story is the core of the book and could have been better told without all the time jumping and one less mystery-solving descendant.  Linus's story solved one mystery but then became a creepy sidebar.   I never bonded with any of the characters.    Dispite my tough rating, I hope Ms. Morton continues writing and look forward to reading more as her story-telling matures.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Great little HDMI cable for almost pennies compared to what the normal retail stores charge which is just outrageous for the same stuff.<br /><br />If your looking to save 30-45$ then I suggest going with this cable. The length is great even if you don't need it quite this long,you never know in the future if you will so you might as well buy longer.<br /><br />Stop buying the overpriced HDMI cables from the retail stores and maybe they will start to get the hint.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I like most of the tracks on this disc.  My favorite is the bossa nova sounding duet with the Foo Fighters entitled \\"Virginia Moon\\". This song is very pretty. \\"Court And Spark\\" is my other favorite.  Herbie Hancock's piano playing is superb.  Another gem is the track \\"More Than This\\".  This track is very soothing.  Norah has a new band called El Madmo. The tune \\"The Hardest Part\\" has a seductive tone to it that I love. \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" has a playful quality to it. Norah sounds great singing with Willie Nelson here. Sean Bones is a new comer to me.  He duets with Norah on the tune \\"Turn Them\\". This song is pleasant to listen to.  It puts me in a good mood.  Norah sings a few country songs. My favorite country tune is Loretta\\".  This song has excellent acoustic guitar playing.  \\"Bull Rider\\" and \\"Creepin In\\" are two upbeat country tunes that I like.  \\"Little Lou, Prophet John and Ugly John\\" is an unusual song title, but this is such a sweet song.  I love the sound of \\"Ruler Of My Heart\\"  The Dirty Dozen Brass Band accompany Norah so well with their instruments. \\"Blue Bayou\\" is a classic song, but the tempo here is too slow for my tastes. \\"Life Is Better\\" is a track that I do not care for.  This hip hop song does not suit Norah's voice.  Overall though, this is enjoyable music.
1400079144|3.0|I was totally engrossed with this book until the last 10 chapters.  Then the suspense was gone, there was way too much preaching, and the events were highly unbelievable.  The two main characters in the end chapters had just--almost minutes earlier--undergone severe psychological and physical trauma, and somehow they were still able to climb to the top of the Capitol and climb down from the Washington Monument.  If the last 10 chapters had been moved to \\"6 months later,\\" it would have been more effective.  As it was, I was disappointed, to say the least.  I had this book rated at least 4 stars until the end.
B0039SFKSW|3.0|I've been listening to Omega for a few months now.  Unfortunately, I can't agree with the rave reviews, although I'm a big fan of the original lineup of Asia.  When their last album Phoenix came out, I couldn't get enough of it.  I thought it was a rare comeback album worthy of great popularity.  In my opinion, Omega just doesn't have the punch of that album.  There are too many middle of the road tracks here that I skip cause they are just not that exciting (i.e., Light The Way, Emily, Still The Same, Don't Wanna Lose You Now, being the main choices for weak tracks).  I think the best track on the album is There Was A Time, which shows great keyboard melody skills by Geoff Downes and moving vocals by John Wetton.  I think what I find myself wishing for is more memorable guitar from Steve Howe, which just isn't here.  That said, there is still half an album of strong music that I continue to listen to.  Fans will like this one, but may agree with my more objective take.
1439107955|5.0|Fellow writers and readers: Siddartha Mukherjee's seminal work on Cancer's biography is an exquisitely crafted tome that synchronously and seamlessly tells a complex story that is accessible as it is compelling. Dr. Mukherjee could, if he so chose, write a book on frying cheese omelets that would be a page turner.<br /><br />Bravo!<br /><br />CAUTION: Fellow hypochondriacs beware - as I read \\"Emperor...\\" if an eyelash fell out, if I felt the blush of a nerve in a tooth, or if my stomach growled I panicked and felt the urge to telephone my internist who I have on speed dial.
0439023491|5.0|This is a book of such incredible power, and sacrifice and love, and ideals, rendered with irresistible humanity. The author blends subtle metaphors and symbols into the story, adding an artistic touch to what is already an enthrallingly gritty story of characters that you wish you didn't love so much.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that is the pinnacle of a writing career, the kind you may never be able to top, the kind most authors will never come close to writing.<br /><br />But GAAHHHH, I have to wait another year to find out what happens after the end of this book!!!!
B003XKPPOU|5.0|this movie was great. a little scary! i was on the   edge of my seat for most of it.   would definitely buy it again and again
B001ECDVYK|5.0|Oh man, I am so happy to finally have a blu ray of this flick. America needs to get the lead out! I shouldn't have to order imports! If one country has the blu ray, why don't they all? Anyway, this has always been one of my favorites! It looks good. It sounds good. Everything I wanted. Thanks!
B000256TD0|3.0|This car looks awesome. There is a small button in the back that you can press and the car lights up and makes noises, but the sound is really low. My son has had this toy car for a year now and he's busted it. He pulled off the fuel line and two of the wheels. I cannot snap them back on. If you are into Back to the Future and wish to use this car as a display item, then it's worth buying, but if you're buying this toy for a three-year-old for $30, which is what it costs at some Target stores and what it costs for us, then think about it because this toy busted within the year.
0920668372|5.0|Execellent book for young and old alike, lifes lesson made simple. Really enjoyed it beyond explanation. If you haven't read it you should and share it with your whole family.
0618918248|5.0|I have been teetering on the idea of Atheism for many years as faith in different religions has seemed pointless and comical. The stories in religion to me never added up and the circus that tags along with the idea of \\"belief\\" was definately a turn off. Thats where the book \\"The God Delusion\\" steps in.<br /><br />There are some books that are really transformative and have the ability to change your life if you are able to truly understand its message. And this is one such book. There is a real social stigmatism about calling oneself an Atheist. The thesis of the book not only deals with the fradulent and \\"fairy-tale\\" aspects of religion, but it proposes that one can be an Atheist and a law-abiding, compassionate, and happy individual with morals.<br /><br />There are other books about the topic of Atheism but after reading this i have no desire to delve into any others, although I just may because i love to read. Dawkins covers all of the bases, and gives what I consider the most complete and eloquently written text of what it is like to be a free thinking and rational human being.<br /><br />Has science answered all of life's mysteries? Well...no. And they may never. But think of all that science has given us.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the people that need to read a book like this the most, mainly \\"belivers\\", wont or wont really understand the message. I feel that most of the people that will really be drawn to this book are either already atheists or are teetering on becoming one officially as was I. Most of the bad reviews are probably from people that couldn't understand and embody the message or came from a brainwashed individual that is trying to support their own religion.<br /><br />Thank you Richard Dawson for letting rationalists feel that they are not an outcast. Thank you for writing a book that pushes one to put an end to magical thinking and deal with what is real.
B004AQR29C|1.0|I watched this when it was on sale for 99 cents.  If it had been $3.99, I'd have given it a half star rating.  The \\"plot\\" in this movie is weak.  The \\"script\\" is so bad, that I could've written something better in a couple of hours.  Some of the one-liners are just awful and dumb. At times, one gets the sense that even the actors know how bad this movies is!  Don't watch this.  It's sad because Stallone is capable of being a great actor.  Check him out in \\"Copland\\" or \\"F.I.S.T.\\"--he's great!  I can't believe that he would act in this utter trash!!  I hate this movie!
0060853964|5.0|This book had me laughing from page one. If you like either of these authors there is flavor from the both of them and it's mixed so well that I'm not sure who is writing what at times. I love how our main characters intend to 'sabatoge' the apocolypse and still somehow manage to have a wild and outrageous adventure. Watch out for the Good Omens of Agnes Nutter and READ THIS BOOK. I am currently in the procesess of getting through it for a third time and my roommate keeps swiping it to read when she thinks I don't notice lol. It's so worth the buy.
B00007G207|3.0|This is the No. 1 movie on my all-time favorite list.  I finally saw the Director's original version and I know why the scenes it includes were omitted in the U.S. release. The acting (particularly the scene in the car when Salvadore and Elena meet as adults) is down-right clumbsy.  The added army scenes added a touch of humor and admittedly explained Salvadore's absence for such a long period but I rather liked the unrequitedness of the shorter version.  It left one with a haunted feeling for the main character.
0061989142|5.0|I got this book for a birthday present for someone who has loved Lauren Conrad from the beginning. I have never really been a fan but after reading this book I have a totally different opinion of her. This is a great book about the title, Style. If you are looking for trendy up to the moment everything, this isn't the book for you. This is a book that helps you form and define your own personal style. You learn how to really dressy yourself so that you are always looking you best. I would recommend this product to everyone people with style and those who are looking to get it!!!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|This time,  Bella's pals, dad, and Esme get very little screen time, while the focus shifts more to the conflict between Edward and Jacob over Bella and her future.  There is also a group of newborn vampires as well as some older ones, wolves vs. vamps, and plenty of misery and angst to go around among the three leads.  Ho hum. Whatever.  This is the weakest of the books and the weakest of the movies as well.    There is some great scenery, as well as some decent makeup and music, though I still think they could have done a much better job on the wolves.
B001DRF84W|2.0|The casting was terrible, the script horrible, the effects sub par and all wrapped up in a screen play that was better used as a bird cage liner.    Giant poodles? That was their idea of thrills and chills? Did anyone in post production actually WATCH this mess before they unleashed it on the public? Exactly what color were they seeing when they viewed the Hulk on screen the first time.    This movie went nowhere in the theatres and did even worse as a rental.    Watch and then buy the Edward Norton version. Forget that this version even exists. The studio has.
B0048Y9TPG|1.0|The first xmas cd was good.  This one is just unlistenable.  Other reviews have commented about her strange vocals, so I won't add to it, but even if she did sing like she used to, it wouldn't help much - the songs are boring. Even the cd cover is boring (The same pose as the first cd? Weird.)  If you don't have her first xmas cd, get it, it's worth it. Let this one fade to oblivion.
0930289234|5.0|The year is 1985, and Nixon is in the White House. Cowering under the threat of nuclear Armageddon, the citizens of the United States -- and its masked adventurers -- try to make sense of a world gone mad. And behind that madness is a deeper madness, one intended to bring peace and sanity.<br /><br />If you read this graphic novel back when it was published in 1986, when the Cold War with the Soviet Union was very much a reality, then you will remember the chilling fear of nuclear termination that was prevalent in our daily lives and referenced so frequently in pop culture.<br /><br />And if you read it now, post 9/11, you will have a completely different perspective on the Machiavellian mystery this brilliant novel eventually solves. In the final chapter, you see the graphic images on the pages in front of you, but your mind flashes to a different scene on the streets of New York City. And you are left wanting Moore.
B003HARV3Y|3.0|Hi, I'm Katie. Now before you read this whole long rant you should know: if you haven't read the books IT'S A GOOD MOVIE and that's all you need to know! PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF IS AN AWESOME ACTION MOVIE!! End of story. However if you have read the books and you want to know if you should watch the movie: It depends- so, read below:         First about me, just so you know this is the opinion of a teenage girl, I don't know how an adult would review this but this is my personal opinion and I believe I have valid points so you should listen anyway.   I got hooked on these books when I started reading them to my little brother. My grandma sent the first book to him for his birthday, but it was a little above his reading level. When he saw the movie commercials on TV and he asked me to read it to him I thought what the heck? I really didn't expect to love them so much. After the first book I was addicted. I couldn't wait to finish the series. I've read them all. Its an awesome story. Now to review to movie, but first:               ***A WARNING- I AM A SPOILER!! But I'm honest and at least read the rest of this paragraph, I promise no spoilers. First if you haven't watched the movie and have read the book you're lucky, because you can take the advice I'm gonna give you. Try to watch the movie with an open mind. There are lots of changes, its very different from the book but i loved it. However the movie is more for older kids. The books are appropriate for younger kids but in the movie the characters are like 16, (Sorry if that's a spoiler. But, come on, you can tell from the cover there's no way he's twelve!) And there are some inappropriate innuendos and more risqué scenes. Just a warning. For you people that have read the books and loved them, I do recommend you watch the movie but just be careful of your expectations or you may be disappointed. But who knows maybe you hated the books and the changes in the movie are you're style. :)         And if you still want to read my review/opinion here it is.           In my opinion the movie was great. But it would've been greater and less disappointing if it wasn't related to Rick Riordan's genius series. Because then there would still be hope for a good, book-following movie. And the now-crushed hope for a sequel.       In the movie, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, I love that the characters in the movie were my age. It's easier for me to relate to since I'm not twelve. I wish I was Annabeth. The movie pulls you into the story just like the books, and I immediately fell in love with Percy! The acting was remarkable and the beginning of the movie was an awesome lead in!  The character I was most impressed with was Gabe. He was disgusting and rude, I felt bad for Percy's mom! I was disappointed that Gabe was the character most closely portrayed. Joe Pantoliano did an awesome job.    I was disappointed with how the story progressed.  The action and affects were good, but the scenes in the book were too. For example the chimera scene would've been just as good as the hydra scene. In Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief the movie, the whole middle of the movie is completely different. It's completely made up!! The journey to hell isn't as exciting and there aren't as many obstacles. And the huge characters that present the obstacles such as Ares, Clarisse, the echidna and chimera Mr. D, and Hephaestus are cut out because the story is so totally different. There's no stop at the arch, the diner or the water park. It's a domino effect of change.  And with those pieces and people missing, parts of the characters are missing. With out these details it not possible to learn about certain personal details like Annabeth's love of architecture. The important details that shape the book, like the prophecy, the story of Thalia, the pact are all missing. Even the reason they suspect Hades! In the book Chiron suggested Hades for thethief because he was angry with his brother for breaking the pact. That's never explained in the movie. Even little nit-picky details like Annabeth's supposed to have blond hair, Grover's supposed to be a little nerdy guy that gets bullied. Percy and Grover shouldn't be HOT! Percy should give Luke's shoes to Grover because it would be dangerous to fly in Zeus's domain. And I was disappointed in how the camp looked I was expecting something cooler and bigger. There are so many differences and not enough of the same parts in the book to resemble the original story.         After I finished the book series I was super excited to watch the stories come to life in a series of movies. But that's impossible; because in the second movie they won't be able to add all the missing pieces.   That being said I know that it's nearly impossible to create a movie the mirror image of the book. But this is too different.  Other than characters names and the ending goal in the broadest terms, this movie completely different! One of the things I hate most about watching movies based on books I've read is when the creator takes too much liberty in changing the story. For example: My Sister's Keeper, WTF people!! Hello?? The wrong girl dies in the end! I wanted to scream.          Anyway as I said before it is a good movie, and I love it! In fact, it's on my Christmas list. But it would've been better if they had at least kept ideas similar. Maybe my expectations were too high. But when I watch a movie the goes with a book I've read I can't help but note all the things different. I always read the book first and am usually disappointed (don't get me started on Twilight). But I can't just turn off my brain.          If you've never seen this movie and you read this anyway. I'm sorry I told you I was a spoiler. But still, I DO recommend this movie. Even though there are an uncountable amount of changes, it's a good quality movie, but, be cautious because even though I love this movie, I only give it 3 stars because it's too different for me personally but maybe you'll like it. Consider yourself warned! :)
0515142247|5.0|I simply love this book. I like Reacher so much! Where can I find a man like him? As the series go on he became an invincible superman but this Die Trying is very good. It is exciting and reads fast. He is just so cool.
B0041T52S6|5.0|The movie meet all expectations for one of the best movies of this year. I read all six graphic navels and the movie did great justice to the spirit of the books.
B0012GMYI2|5.0|Awesome, pure and simple; that's what heavy metal was meant to be as purveyed by Germany's Accept on their landmark fourth release `Restless and Wild'. If \\"Fast As a Shark\\" doesn't qualify as one of the all-time greatest heavy metal songs then there is a problem with whoever is ranking the tunes. The song is a complete assault on the senses and was a speed metal anthem for the early `80's.  Just for this song alone the LP would draw serious praise from maniacs the world over but you have the title track, \\"Princess of the Dawn\\", \\"Shake Your Heads\\" and \\"Neon Nights\\".  \\"Flash Rockin' Man\\" is reminiscent of some of the arena stuff on `Breaker' but just as that album was a step up from the first two then `Restless and Wild' is a notch above `Breaker'. Udo never sounded as aggressive here and the guitars of Wolf Hoffmann and new man Herman Franck are as good as metal gets. Accept would start to draw some unfavorable comparison from some nitwit critics - saying the band was a rip-off of Judas Priest and although the band had a similar style and delivery to the elder metal legends, Accept was arguable the better band at this point as Priest was trying to sound more commercial and \\"American Radio friendly\\" whereas Accept was busy trying to conquer the continent and Asia with a decidedly more aggressive sound.  Now many are giving the band their due as a heavy influence on thrash and power metal but unfortunately it didn't help them sales wise during their Udo led prime. Just shake your heads, cry out as long as you can..
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Both my husband and I love this dvd series. It has intrigue, power, deception, greed, sex and conspiracy all rolled up into one series. It was like watching a Roman soap opera at it finest! lol
020530902X|5.0|The Book arrived in a reasonable length of time and was in great shape.  This is a classic book written many years ago that still stands up today.
0783240287|3.0|Everything about this production is great.  My kids love it.    However, the audio quality is horrible.    The audio track overall is far too quiet.  Can't hear the dialogue at all, and forget about background vocals at typical volume levels.  Having cranked the TV up to hear anything (and you eventually will), you'll be blasted with a musical intro when the next scene comes up.    I find it very hard to believe how this issue sneaked past the duplicating engineers.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|This movie is a good sequel to the first SATC movie, it does follow on with the story line on all 4 women. They don't have a whole lot of time in NYC, and spend over half the movie in the Middle East... all in all good movie.
B000YHG72E|3.0|While there were indeed parts of the movie that were good mindless fun, much of this movie just didn't fit together very well.  Walter Hobbs change of life is unsubstantiated, Jovie falling in love with Buddy is cute - but thin.  Best laugh?  When Buddy launches himself at the Christmas tree and it falls over on him.
0316017922|5.0|This is a great book and essential reading.  It can be best categorized under the field of social psychology.    I particularly enjoyed the concept that professionals in a field pay their dues.  You practice or work 10,000 hours in that specific field -- then they're able to compete at the world's highest levels.    The Timing of the Industrial revolution and the Computer PC era breakdown of how society shapes specific people who are Outliers is amazing.    I enjoyed the study of the birth month of Canadian Hockey Players relative to the annual Hockey season cutoff date and the compounding factor that plays each year to produce NHL players and the same example for Major League Baseball Players as well.    It's all under the surface with this book, and it's amazing how Gladwell peels back the onion to reveal how success if far more complicated that it initially appears.

I have not read any of them, but my son regularly brings them to me to read a passage or show me an illustration that he enjoyed.

1439163146|2.0|Is it  bad when a Hollywood star wants to be a literary person? After all, their celeb status alone will ensure sales from fans and the curious. But we get Ethan Hawke's awful novels and Michael Mann's Bukowski-imitation poetry...or Suzaane Sommers' poetry...even Oliver's Stone attempt at a novel was sour...<br /><br />Franco studied with two Gordon Lish writers, Ben Marcus and Amy hempel, who give him blurbs...and supposedly studied in Lish's summer class last year...the first story, \\"Halloween,\\" has a first sentence that tries too hard to be the kind of first sentence Gordon Lish advocates in his classes...or perhaps it is Amy Hempel...<br /><br />Franco is an excellent actor, but not writer. Although I think he could pen a great screenplay, but not literature.<br /><br />For a much better collection of stories by a Hollywood celeb, try Michael Boatman's God Laughs When You Die from The Dybbek Press.  Who is Boatman you say?  he has been in films like hamburger Hill and The Blue Shield, and played second comic lead in shows like Spin City and Arli$$.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|\\"Winter's Bone\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: 17-year-old Ree Dolly sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared. If she fails, Ree and her family will be turned out into the Ozark woods. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree hacks through the lies, evasions and threats offered up by her relatives and begins to piece together the truth.    The cast led by Jennifer Lawrence (in her breakout performance as Ree) is brilliant! The directing by Debra Granik (also wrote the screenplay) (who also wrote and directed \\"Down To The Bone\\" (2004) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell) by Granik & Anne Rosellini (also produced) (she also produced \\"Down To The Bone\\") is brilliant!    The music by Dickon Hinchliffe (who also did the music to \\"Last Chance Harvey\\" (2008) is brilliant! The cinematography by Michael McDonough (also an associate producer) (who also did the cinematography to \\"Down To The Bone\\") is brilliant! The film editing by Affonso Gonçalves (who also did the film editing to \\"The Door In The Floor\\" (2004) is brilliant! The casting by Kerry Barden & Paul Schnee (both of them did the casting to \\"Conviction\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Machine Gun Preacher\\" (2011) is brilliant! The production design by Mark White (who also did the production design to \\"Down To The Bone\\", \\"Transamerica\\" (2005), \\"Please Give\\" (2010) & the upcoming \\"Prom\\" (2011) is brilliant! The set decoration by Rebecca Brown (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming \\"Shelter\\" (2011) is brilliant! The costume design by Rebecca Hofherr is brilliant!    This is a brilliant film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. This is a film that is different from the other recent films out there. Jennifer Lawrence gives the star-making performance of her career, which is already gaining her award recognition. This is one of the best films of the year.

B00428ZRFE|2.0|This album is back-to-basics nonsense. Rihanna's personal evolution has taken a serious downfall with Loud, which should be called Quiet. There is little to no real excitement going on. In comparison to Rated R, the lyrics have taken ten steps down, not being nearly as well-written or well-sang.  Most of the beats are very typical R and B ballads that anyone could've made. Those who are serious about being happy this album took such a direction clearly have no idea what good music is. I'll take \\"Hard\\" over \\"What's My Name\\" anyday. This album lacks any real excitement except on the first single, and half of it sounds like filler. Truth be told, it doesn't even come close to being as good as \\"A Girl Like Me,\\" her second album. Not even \\"Music Of The Sun,\\" the album that had exactly one hit single.     The only really good song on this album is \\"Only Girl In The World.\\" Do not support the whiney, old, and invalid fans of days long past, or Rihanna will never recover from making such a boring, bland album. Hopefully she will beable to not be tossed in the field of typical, staying inside the box singers that she put herself with making \\"Loud.\\"     And not to mention false advertising again in the title. Rihanna is supposed to be hard. If people cannot deal with it, I don't see why anyone should care. Rihanna, I love you, but this CD is awful!

0393072231|5.0|This is the best book on financial markets in a decade, maybe more. It is entertaining, easy to read and manages to explain in simple terms extremely complex facts and products.    It gives a unique opportunity to understand how derivatives can be misused, why the financial markets profit from this and how governments keep unnatural markets alive, while passing the bill to the taxpaying community.    The book's conclusion can be extended one step further: It is the same taxpaying community that benefited from the low interest rates, high liquidity, and other benesses of the unnaturally organized markets! This closes a circular money flow that allows US wealth to grow faster than US production. An excellent question is: where does the extra wealth come from? Regardless its origin, it is obvious that similar circles can not go on forever.
B004132HZS|5.0|Loved Conan Doy;es books, and I LOVE this series.    Though I loved the new movie with RDJ, I felt it failed in respect to Sherlock, specifically in relation to his \\"relationship\\" with Adler. Too many hints of romantic attachment, where Conan Doyle had none.    This is where I think this series have done this right. Their portrayal of Sherlock is spot on. Quirky, intelligent, abnoxious to the point of humour, but totally focussed on his work, at the expense of reality. The relationship between Holmes & Watson was always odd based on Sherlocks obsession with investigation, and his separation from relating with the world. Gatiss, Thompson & Moffat have represented Sherlock's obsessive character, & the odd development of his & Watson's characters, perfectly    Yes, it's set in modern day London thus making it more excessible to a younger generation, but it still has nice illusions to the books in words, phrases, people, & places. And then there is the soundtrack which itself simultaneously carries a modern, & old English feel.    I was referred to this series by an English friend & have now shared it with most of my family, & a number of my friends, & they all enjoy it as much as me (&, mind you, I introduced them by watching it with them ü) I absolutely enjoy this series & eagerly await season 2.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|So, the only reason I didn't give this all 5 stars is because I've never had a proper heatsink/non-stock cooling system before. I want to leave room to grow/compare.<br /><br />That said, I'm VERY impressed with this heatsink. At stock speeds/voltages/temperatures I was getting 35ºC/40ºC degrees with my Core i5-650 3.2GHz. Currently, I have it overclocked to 3.9GHz with stock voltages and I'm running around 26ºC under normal conditions and only 55ºC Max running OCCT. I can hear when the fan kicks up, but it's just a white noise type of sound, not distracting, not annoying-so I would say it's silent. I am using Arctic Silver 5 with it instead of the compound it came with (I was going to test it but don't have much time to deal with it)<br /><br />The value is good, similar heatsinks on newegg were more expensive.<br /><br />The installation instructions are a little vague, and the language is weird (it obviously was translated into English). You have to look closely at the diagrams to check the orientation of the under panel but it was pretty clear if you look at the detail. One review on here said it was unclear you had to remove the motherboard-I don't think this is the case at all, the picture and I believe the words say as such.<br /><br />My only other complaint is the size, with the way it's mounted on top of the CPU, and just it's regular size, it sticks out just about 1/4\\" from where my case side panel should be. So I have the side panel loosely attached to the tower giving it a little more airflow, I'm not sure if it's a bad thing that it's touching the panel, but I think it may give more surface area to dissipate the heat and a little more air exchange. I donno, I haven't noticed any ill effects so far and it's not the fault of the product by any means-I just thought it would fit when I measured it. Not a huge inconvenience as I'm really not that concerned about the aesthetics of the actual hardware, it's the performance and its heat-dissipation that matter, and this definitely does its job. I'm very pleased.ts job. I'm very pleased.
0061537934|5.0|Weeks after finishing The Art of Racing in the Rain by Garth Stein, I am still thinking of it.     What makes a great book, is that having already gone on to read another book,The Art of Racing in the Rain, still creeps into my mind.     I began reading the book as a dog lover, but now as I think of it, all the human implications come into my mind. The \\"Art\\" is the way to succeed not just in racing, but in getting through life, especially those difficult times we face.    This book is not just for dog lovers, or race car driving lovers (which I am not, and knew nothing about, except for this book), but is for anyone introspective about life. It's for anyone trying to find away to succeed. The \\"Art\\" is the way to succeed.

B001FB5634|1.0|Bogus. The plot in this movie is totally unrealistic, and an unbelievable waste of the creative talents of Viggio Mortenson. In addition, in a post apocalyptic world, the weak would be the first to die, and the kid in that movie is not only weak, but can't even keeps it mouth shut. Even assuming that a kid like the one portrayed in the movie were protected (Impossible in the situation described!)in that type of world, anyone that went around crying, whining, and making noise all of the time like that stupid kid would never survive in a conventional war zone, let alone a post apocalyptic world.

B003TJR2HS|4.0|This product was as advertised, and although I find this product -- and Sendstation's Dock Extender ([[ASIN:B000XEB7OQ SendStation Dock Extender for iPod (Black)]]) -- to be moderately overpriced, these extenders do what they're supposed to do. While I give this product a four-star rating, in the end it didn't do what [I] needed to do. Personally, this product gets a two-star rating in my book; yet that's not of any real fault of the product or its manufacturer.<br /><br />I also recently purchased Speck's CandyShell case ([[ASIN:B003TO53WY Speck Products CandyShell Case for iPhone 4 (Moonsicle White/Charcoal)]]) for my iPhone 4 to replace my old iFrogz Luxe Original case. As both of these products came to me the (the CandyShell & the DockStubz) came to me in the mail from Amazon, I was hoping that the extender would work with my new case. Once I received both of them, however, I quickly realized that the dockStubz extender was entirely too thick to make it through the dock connector cut-out of the CandyShell case.<br /><br />I also recently purchased iHome's iA5 alarm clock/speaker dock ([[ASIN:B0035FCWBC iHome iA5 App-Enhanced Alarm Clock Speaker System for iPod and iPhone (Black)]]), and since I'm the type of person who can't stand using an Apple product without a case, I needed some kind of extender in order for my iPhone to be easily set on the iHome iA5 without me having to remove it from my case.<br /><br />I quickly reverted back to my old iFrogz Luxe case, which has a more sizable opening for the dock connector. While that case was compatible with the dockStubz extender, I wasn't pleased with the way the dockStubz looked on my iHome iA5. It's a little tall, compared to the Sendstation extender, and the contouring styling isn't especially attractive to me. The fit, even with my old iFrogz case was mediocre at best.<br /><br />All in all, this product did work the way it was supposed to. It passed the connection thorugh just as I wanted. One thing to consider -- which probably won't affect anyone's everyday use -- is that upon a secure connection between my iPhone 4 and either my Mac or the iA5, it would take an extra second or two for the iPhone to register being connected to a source. This is compared to the standard Apple Dock cable or connecting my iPhone directly to the iA5, there is an instantaneous recognition on the iPhone.<br /><br />While my first choice was the Sendstation Dock Extender, upon impulse, I got this one because it was a few dollars less. Now I'm stuck returning this product (plus shipping costs), and biting the excruciatingly hard bullet of getting the Sendstation Dock extender this time around. Even if it doesn't fit my CandyShell case, hopefully I'll be picking up a Speck PixelSkin HD which should fit the Sendtsation well.<br /><br />I just kinda wish that CableJive didn't claim on the box, that it fits \\"all cases\\" in bold print. You win some, you lose some.

0553381687|2.0|The only known book I'm familliar with that has so many characters is Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment with 22 main personalities. At least Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series are mostly stand alone stories. I got so jumbled up over which Lord was related to this Lord and who owned which castle and how the king was poisoned, the dwarf Tyiron being the most suspect and popularly believed to have done the deed. After reading the 4 book series I was exhausted. I couldn't keep everything straight and why so-and-so did what to whom and why. At the end I got to skiping whole chapters just to finish. Looking back I can't understand why I did read them. Will I anxiously wait for #5? Nope.<br /><br />Finally - the MAPS. This may sound trivial, but I'm a big fan of accuracy in geography of the story. I guess that comes from devoting 26 years of my life in uniform. Several times in the reading I tried to refer back to the maps in the front of the books to try to figure out where the action was taking place. But, very few geographical references exist on the drawing yet seem to be locations of serious plot action. It's too bad the cartographer either didn't read the book or didn't get it proofed by the author. The maps tried to cover too much terrirory and were also so tiny that many times I couldn't read them.<br /><br />Bottom line is I have a lot of respect for Martin's authorship. It takes a lot of time to put together a series like this - keep all the action and characters straight, and I hope he can bring together some kind of closure in #5. If not we may well be looking at the written version of \\"All the day's of our lives\\"

B000AJIF4E|5.0|after having for years the SONY pro HD series I purchased these for my home studio- they are compact, the fit nicely on my big head- the bass response was at first a concern, but I think that you just need to get used to them- the really only concern I have is the durability of them- they are tight- they have a spring loaded frame around them and they snap very quickly when you remove them together- I do not like that- it makes me wonder \\"when are these gonna break?\\"- besides that they are fine- watch the snapping though!
0971407614|5.0|I was skeptical about this book, but now I'm a believer. I read through the ten chapters before getting to the exercises and thought I was ready when it came time to start the workouts. Well, I was wrong - the beginning exercises KICKED MY BUTT. No problem, because he includes modifications to make the exercises easier or harder as needed.    Going to the gym didn't work for me, mostly because of time and cost. The plan in this book costs only the price of the book and nothing else, although I did invest in a cheap timer [[ASIN:B00194PWNQ Gymboss GB2010 SILVER]]    I keep referring back to the book for the routines and various exercises, and also have found it useful to reread most of the introductory chapters. There is also help on his website, which has an active forum that Mark and several others keep going with good advice. There is also a Facebook page if you want to keep track of what Mark is up to, but it really doesn't add anything to your routine.    Here's the thing - I never find the workouts boring, like at the gym. Don't know why, but I look forward to doing it. It takes no prep time (gym clothes, driving, equipment), and you're done in the time it takes to get ready and go to the gym. Before reading and trying it I thought it would be a simple routine that would lose it's effectiveness quickly - that will never happen. This program will work for life, for anybody. Sure, you can modify it (easily), add to it, or work it into your own fitness lifestyle, but you can also use it as is for very good results.

B000001G53|5.0|Peter Hofmann (1944 - 2010), deeply admired for during his rather brief but astonishing operatic career singing the heldentenor roles in Wagner operas, has died.  Hofmann was unique in that he had a beautifully honed voice coupled with a handsome, virile, youthful stage presence, making the roles of Siegmund, Lohengrin, and Parsifal visually as well as vocally credible.  Unfortunately he pushed the voice into the big roles too rapidly and vocal strain set in to the point that he eventually stepped off the opera stage and entered the world of musical theater  (Phantom of the Opera) and popular music until he began to suffer from Parkinson's disease in 1994, and ceased performing in 1999. But when he was in his prime he was a hero of the highest rank.<br /><br />In this recording of Parsifal he was in fine form supported by conductor Herbert von Karajan (in one of his most luminous interpretations of this magnificent score) and the Berlin Philharmonic with the fine Jos&eacute; Van Dam as Amfortas, Kurt Moll as Gurnemanz, Dunja Vejkovic as Kundry and Siegmund Nimsgern as Klingsor.  At least we have this memento (as well as his recording of the Boulez/Chereau Ring and his Lohengrin) to remember how unique was the gift of Peter Hofmann.  For those who saw him as well as heard him when he was in his prime he will always be remembered as one of the Wagnerian greats of that brief period.  Grady Harp, December 10
B000267JQK|4.0|South African hard rock/metal band Seether formed in 1999, their discography opening up with Fragile (while working under the name of Saron Gas and then onto Disclaimer from 2002. Disclaimer II was kinda their breakthrough album and it's easy enough to see why as it remixed/mastered tracks from the Disclaimer album - presumably taking into account the lessons of the road - and another one of the changes was that a re-recorded version of the plaintive ballad Broken featuring Amy Lee of the then white hot Evanescence on duet vocals.<br /><br />The album has a range of good points going for it. Firstly it's not overlong, Seether smart enough to not pound the listener with an overlong album (a common problem around the time of this albums release). Secondly the music is heavy but with some melody. Not in the form of, say, the sort of band you find signed to Italian label Frontiers, but there is a tinge of it there and the riffing style on many of these songs, while formulaic and not too imaginative, is at least commercially viable. What really helps this album along is the peaks - the hit singles - that help break up the album and give the listener a couple of things to `hang their hat on', so to speak. 69 Tea is a quality hard rocker as is opener Gasoline just by the by. And the inclusion of both a plain Jane version of Broken and the outing featuring Amy Lee gives the listener a little bonus, a comparison between the bands original vision and the later take on the song.<br /><br />Lyrically things are pretty dour which suits the time period and the target audience but for all that they get the job done nicely and they gel with the music well rather than feeling tacked on to suit the `kids', heavy rocker Pride being perhaps my favourite example of not only this but also the aforementioned melody. So props.<br /><br />There are a few down sides of course. Firstly hits aside much of this album has that nagging sub-par post grunge quiet verse/loud chorus schtick happening. And while during the not-missed-at-all grunge years having a droning un-expressive voice was cool the vocals of Shaun Morgan can just get too samey sometimes to the point where you feel like poking a pitchfork into his posterior to see if he's capable of a different noise. And let's not go near track Driven Under  where this and repetitive lyrics about some chick with a gun start grating to the point where you'll want to reach for your gun and put the stereo and yourself out of it's misery.<br /><br />Production is pretty much perfect for this kind of thing. It allows things to breath a bit but not too much - gotta keep that claustrophobic feeling going huh guys? - but it all sounds quite professional and you get full lyrics in the booklet and also included is a fairly jam packed thanks list which is a nice touch.<br /><br />Alas I can't comment on the DVD as I only scored the plain version back in the day...<br /><br />Back when they sorta mattered Seether toured Australia and my team leader and I considered going, deciding against it on the grounds the band were second tier (top of the losers pile may be a line that was uttered) and you know what? While I don't regret not going to see them I have finally come to see the serviceability of this album and yeah, maybe I was too harsh the first time `round.ot-missed-at-all grunge years having a droning un-expressive voice was cool the vocals of Shaun Morgan can just get too samey sometimes to the point where you feel like poking a pitchfork into his posterior to see if he's capable of a different noise.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Amazing fourth season. If I had to watch it all by itself and without knowing that something is coming next, I would say this season is by far the best because it is entirely, from beginning to end, a full cycle centering on one serial killer chased by Dexter and chasing Dexter. And that is excellent. The construction of this whole season is perfect and in the style of Stephen King's Dark Tower. The end is the beginning and the last scene can only bring Dexter back to his very first cry in his life and in the first episode of the first season. This closing of the cycle is so beautifully made that it would be the perfect ending for the saga, just like the last page of The Dark Tower is just the same as the first page of The Dark Tower. Life is the most beautiful thing there is to live in this world just because it is always the same, and yet always a new beginning. The sun rises every morning and the moon rises every evening, or nearly so. The variations are themselves cyclical. It is absolutely state of the art primeval pleasure. The serial killer behind this whole season is a cyclical man too, but a double cyclical killer who kills every so often along a cyclical need and always the very same cycle of victims in very set circumstances and very set time spans. The key to this season is that we all know about FBI profiling, so it becomes funny and stange when that profiling fails to be true and is in fact totally wrong. And this time twice again, because it is superficially wrong, the man is not a solitary cat that kills to satisfy his need to have human contact, but the alternative to which Dexter comes is also false because it is only an appearance. That serial killer is keeping appearances, to even kill better and more easily. The series also settles some accounts with the paparazzi, those fake journalists who gather any information and spill it around with no conscience whatsoever and without the slightest pang of conscience about the potential victims the people they expose become. And what if that nosy journalist were a killer herself? And the plot can sicken a little bit more when Rita kisses the neighbor. What a horrible thing to happen, and she is shocked when Dexter does not react the way she expects him to react, so that he has to do something about it, and apologize to the brutalized neighbor on the following morning I guess. This season also gives the dead father an ever more important role to play. He is Dexter's permanent and privileged interlocutor. Then the action is always as packed as usual, though Dexter does not buy donuts for his colleagues every morning as he used to. That's a shame. I liked that habit, but I guess everyone on the team has to watch their waist line and weight. They are getting old in other words. But be sure to get the fifth season, before cancer or his sister takes Dexter away and to find out if the last scene is a real scene or a nightmare. I have my idea about that but let you enjoy the suspense.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDthey expose become.

I liked that habit, but I guess everyone on the team has to watch their waist line and weight. They are getting old in other words. But be sure to get the fifth season, before cancer or his sister takes Dexter away and to find out if the last scene is a real scene or a nightmare. I have my idea about that but let you enjoy the suspense.    Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID
0061730335|5.0|Despite William Kamkwamba's humble background and minimal education, he was able to construct a windmill to provide his family and community with electricity. As an educator, what does this story teach me about teaching? It teaches me that resources for learning are all around us and collaboration is a key to success in any situation.   Resources for learning surround us. William was faced with famine, poverty, and a minimal education. Yet, he still used his local library to continue his studies for general education. While there he found books about energy, physics, and electricity to help him construct his windmill. When he needed supplies to construct his windmill, he made his own tools and dug through the scrap yard for parts. Teachers need to search for innovative ways to teach all of their lessons.    Collaboration is essential for success. When William needed nuts, bolts, or a generator his cousin was there to assist him. Without his cousins, his windmill would never have been assembled. Teachers need to encourage their students to collaborate.
B0049D1TCM|4.0|Nicki Minaj has emerged this year after years of grinding on the underground mixtape circuit - congratulations on her for that because if it was as easy as some think it is to break through then many more of the women who are STILL grinding underground would have deals.  My sister told me about Nicki a couple of years ago and I searched her out on youtube so once this year began and she started appearing as a featured artist and I heard about her deal with Young Money, I was really happy for her.<br /><br />A lot of the tracks are autobiographical and speak to her struggles to succeed, her desire to uplift her family as well as the venom she's faced from others in the industry and as a female, I appreciate the lyrics so much - she did not go the sexpot route or the female gang-banger/drug dealer route, her lyrics are honest and spoke to me.<br /><br />The tracks I have on repeat are:<br /><br />MOMENT FOR LIFE F/ DRAKE - great track on which Nicki & Drake speak about how much they are enjoying their success and want the moment to last for life;<br /><br />I'M THE BEST - she speaks about her early career, climb to success, working hard yet acknowledges that others are coming at her but right now, she IS the best;<br /><br />ROMAN'S REVENGE F/ EMINEM - Nicki goes hard at her haters on this one;<br /><br />RIGHT THRU ME & YOUR LOVE - bubblegum rap tracks that I love as much for her singing as for the raps;<br /><br />SAVE ME - she sings on the entire track;<br /><br />FLY F/ RIHANNA - nice aspirational song with Rihanna singing the chorus;<br /><br />DEAR OLD NICKI - great lyrics as today's Nicki speaks to the underground Nicki about why she's made some of the choices she's made and hopes that \\"old Nicki\\" understands and returns someday;<br /><br />The extra tracks: BLOW YA MIND - love this track, the bridge is sung by someone who sounds a little like Prince; SUPER BASS - another pop-ish track that works; MUNY - catchy beat, Nicki uses her British accent on this one.<br /><br />I find the outright wishes for her failure quite sad - most of the men who are negative don't seem to be the type who would support FEMCEES anyway and while Nicki's album leans to the pop side, SO WHAT!?! Other female MCs mixed in hard tracks, party tracks, r&b-ish tracks on their albums and they were accepted so what is it about Nicki that has the haters so agitated? - the characters? the crazy costumes? the \\"flavored\\" wigs? - that's just a smart marketing tool to get some mainstream attention to a new artist.<br /><br />Nicki had skills as an underground rapper and she still displays those skills on this album - I can't imagine anyone who really listened to it giving it less than 3 stars just on the strength of the music alone.ho are negative don't seem to be the type who would support FEMCEES anyway and while Nicki's album leans to the pop side, SO WHAT!?!

1427210497|5.0|This audio book was my very first exposure to the literary phenomenon that is Jonathan Franzen.  I don't know if this is a common reaction, but I feel like he wrote this novel with me in mind.  This book has everything I want to read written in a highly addictive stream of consciousness voice. Its a family saga spanning a generation in which a Minnesota based family, the Bergland's, encounters gossip, resentment, love, sex, hate, politics, jealousy and the events of the last half century.  We are also treated to almost every characters perspective.  His characters are written so sharply, I'd be surprised if the Bergland's were not actual people.  For once, I feel that a novel has actually lived up to its hype.  Easily one of the best books I've come across this year.<br /><br />David LeDoux does a magical job with every character, and he even brings shrill female laughter to life.  He makes 19 discs feel too short.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Glorious record. The best voice of this generation daring enough to bring us new, complex and beautiful music. Different to other pop-classical singers who always play safe and sure, Josh has the guts to bring us a a completly different sound. His previous albums are great but this is a masterpiece. Of course it wont be liked at first because sometimes we get used to the same kind of music over and  over. This album not. It is a kind of progresive pop and a serious try to get into something original and use THE voice in a major way. The recording is brilliant, the orchestations  magical. Rick Rubin brings his imput and Josh proves that he is unique. Some of the songs bring to my memory the great new Broadway composers like Adam Guettel.  ps. Excuses for my english as I am from Spain

B00447G29S|4.0|I saw this movie (actually a shortened version) at Stone Mountain, Georgia last weekend where it was billed as being 4-D. The 4-D came from the 3-D presentation along with some physical effects such as vibrating seats, water sprays, hot chocolate smell, etc. added to it. While the train was skidding sideways across the ice, water was being sprayed on my cheeks and it felt just like little sprinkles of ice hitting me! But the real star of the show was the 3-D. During the rollercoaster train ride it almost felt like I was on the train. And when the waiters were tossing hot chocolate around to the kids I almost expected to get hit with a cup. This is a movie that is made much better by 3-D. If you have a 3-D TV I would suggest this be one of your movie purchases since you won't have to worry about buyer's remorse when you get home.     My very first experience with 3-D was at the Central Florida State Fair in Orlando in 1967. At the Chevrolet tent, Chevy had set up a dish-shaped screen about 15 feet in diameter in front of a few rows of folding chairs and showed a short commercial video on it. The video started off with some folks on a swing and I felt like I was moving back and forth with them. Next came a trip down into the Grand Canyon on a mule; a jostling, jaunty ride that was utterly realistic. Before long the viewer was put in the driver's seat of a 1967 Corvette Stingray that was in a race. The sensation was so real that I was rocking side to side as the 'vette hit the corners and when it came to a screeching stop I almost flew off the front of my chair. The entire thing was done without using glasses! That level of 3-D has yet to appear for consumers, but perhaps someday it will.     I'm glad to see that the studios are making 3-D movies that use something other than red/green glasses available to home viewers. The first 3-D movie I ever saw that used these new types of glasses was in 1978 and was titled \\"Frankenstein 3-D\\", a monster movie that made the most of the technology. The visual effects were spectacular, at some points bordering on sickening, such as when a spear was thrust completely through a person, shoving an organ out of the front of the abdomen and dangling it at a point that seemed mere inches from my nose. At one point in the movie a bird appeared to fly directly out of the screen and toward my face making me flinch. This made me hunger for more 3-D. Unfortunately the viewing audiences of the day weren't quite ready for that and after one more visually-stunning, but not very profitable, 3-D film about invaders from outer space things went back to 2-D.     If Polar Express 3-D is any indication, we're entering a great time for watching movies! I only hope we don't end up with competing formats that make buying the necessary equipment perilous for the pocketbook.
B003XOAJ6K|5.0|I think Big Thing is one of the must unappreciated albums Duran Duran have ever released.  It was described by John Taylor on the \\"Extraordinary World\\" documentary that it was such a lmbering epic that nobody wanted to know about it, which I think is rather harsh.  I remember the first time I heard I Don't Want Your Love and being so excited at how good it was.  All the energy was there in spades and it was a perfect introduction to the album.  I don't think it was a lumbering epic, I just think that it was so far ahead of its time people didn't know how to take it.  Nobody was listening to acid house yet!  The three singles were perfect choices, especially Do You Believe In Shame?, with a Chen Kaige video (one of their best, and included in this set), but I think every track is a standout.  I honestly can't find fault with this album.  The included concert shows they were as innovative as ever with their live performances and the bonus tracks are all essential listening.  This is probably my favourite album of the 80's, and definatly my favourite Duran album (but check back with me after All You Need Is Now).
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My Grandhildren and I have watched it 4 times now since I recived it.

B003XOAJ7E|4.0|Years had gone by since Seven & The Ragged Tiger, and since then two seperate projects had formed (Arcadia and The Power Station) and then there were only three members ready to return to the Duran fold.<br />Duran Duran really needed to come back with the best work, and though this didn't really happen they definatly did the smart thing, with Nile Rogers not only producing a slick sounding album but practically becoming a member of the band at the time.<br />The are some terrific songs on this album (Notorious, Skin Trade, Matter of Feeling, Hold Me) and some where they seemed to take their eye off the ball (why was Meet el Presidente even a single) but on the whole it works as a funky addition to the Duran canon.<br />This is a terrific re-release, well mastered and the extras are worth the price of admission with some terrific almost impossible to get remixes of American Science and Vertigo and Working For The Skin Trade is a terrific concert.
B00006JKOL|4.0|In 1975, the golden era of progressive rock was on the wane. Punk would arrive a few short years later along and disco was in the midst of an entrance. It was the beginning of the end of an era, so to speak.  Up in the gallery, oblivious to just about all external eras, stood Jethro Tull, just off a string of two of their most commercial records; A Passion Play and War Child.  After his attempts to realize his music on the stage and then the screen, Ian Anderson clearly longed for a back to the basics approach. One can imagine him pulling out his Roy Harper collection and envisioning himself as a folk/prog guitarist much in the same vein.  This was definitely a step in the right direction. While both the previous albums were best sellers in the Tull catalogue, the numbers were on the decline as interested parties became turned off by the discordant melodies, accordian solos and general mayhem in the lyrics department.  While this is definitely an acoustic guitar driven album, there is also an attempt to tackle the age old challenge- fusing the electric thunder with the gentle rain of the more traditional instrument. Tull had already made some progress (more than most) although the \\"plugged\\" and \\"unplugged\\" sections are noticeably seperate.  The album opens with the title track; A three section 8 minute long whopper. It begins with Anderson singing his lyrics about a sage musician assessing humanity from his perch \\"in the gallery\\" while strumming an odd (but catchy) chord progression with minimal backup from a mandolin and flute. Then Martin Barre is unleashed upon the unsuspecting audience along with pals Barrie Barlow (think Carl Palmer skills but with actual passion in his style) and Jeffrey Hammond. The bizarre results of this clashing ensemble must be intended to weed out the unfaithful... although I can't say I didn't enjoy it. After a rocky transition, we get into the song proper which is a foot stomping, lung busting whale of a good time with the same exact lyrics from before, but sung to a rather different tempo.  Track two is a perfect example of why you should buy the whole album not just the biggest hit (which is usually edited down anyway so be careful.) If you've ever wondered if there's a Tull take on Led Zep's 'Immigrant Song' this is it. With it's vocals steeped in Norse mythology and it's mercilessly memorable guitar riff (to say nothing of the strings as inserted by David Palmer) 'Cold Wind to Valhalla' is a keeper.  Which by the way is not how I'd describe Black Satin Dancer, a retake on another old theme (those chords are straight out of '25 or 6 to 4' and 'Baby I'm Gonna Leave You' and the closing moments of 'Stairway to Heaven'... take your pick) with nice flute work and nothing else.  'Requiem' is a good all acoustic mini song along the lines of War Child's 'Only Solitaire' or Aqualung's 'Cheap Day Return' but a bit redundant on the re-listen.  You simply don't need it after 'One White Duck / Nothing At All' which is essentially two of the same songs joined at the hip and extended a bit beyond necessary. On the positive side, Ian delivers these with power and subtlety as only he can. It's refreshing to see pompous prog reduced to it's most basic elements (as on Thick as a Brick.)  After three solo tunes, it was time for a mini epic. At almost 17 minutes 'Baker Street Muse' fits the bill. While fans tend to rag on this, I like to think of it as a sort of hidden treasure within the album; a forgotten pearl to mince my metaphors. The catchy \\"Pig-Me and the Whore' section is a highlight with it's disgusting but oh-so clever words, bouncing rhythm guitar and epic atmosphere.  Overall I feel much the same about the album overall as I do it's final track (pardon me for skipping Grace but I'm terribly hungry) -It's a forgotten classic. An album that saw Ian develop as a songwriter by leaps and bounds and a worthy member of the Tull Hall of Fame.  The critics feel it's forced... yes at it's worst moments. But atthe same time this is ridiculously down-to-earth after A Passion Play and an example of what could've happened if Ian had been Bob Dylan. Besides, it's harder rockin' numbers (In short supply at only 3 worth mentioning) are all clever, catchy and melodic. In short all the things that the bulk of War Child... isn't.
1423113381|3.0|For the good, Riordan has created two real and relatable protagonists in his title characters but for the not so good, the story is very long and there are stretches where it can be hard to keep interest stirred. However, the ending is rousing and the stage is nicely set for continuing adventures. For those looking for some more Percy Jackson magic, it's there, but you have to work a little harder to unearth it. Here's hoping for a tighter and more fast paced sequel.
0810979772|5.0|I bought the first 4 books in this series (no.5 was not available yet) and the Do-It-Yourself Book as a birthday gift for our grandson who is in second grade and an accomplished reader.  It loves non-fiction books, but was absolutely thrilled when he opened his gift. Immediately he began reading, but over our visit, he consistently wrote in the diary book.  He really enjoyed having his very own diary and there are a variety of things to do in this particular book.  Another bonus is that the books do not have to be read in a specific order.  He would read one day from one book and then after school the next day, read from a different one.  He even let a friend from school borrow one of the books !  As a former teacher, what a joy it is to see our young people have such great material to read and to have a love for reading :)

B001NFNFNU|5.0|This film is based on a true story that took place in Los Angeles in the early 19th Century. It tells the story of a devoted mother (Angelina Jolie) who was looking for her missing son, Walter Collins. The police, wishing to show some results, produced a boy, convincing him he is Walter, but unsuccessfully convincing the mother, who still insisted that the boy was not her son, and that the police should continue the search after Walter. When she refused to let go, the unscrupulous police captain (Jeffrey T. Donovan) ordered her committed for psychological therapy. To the rescue came a local reverend (John Malkovich) who was pursuing the police for corruption allegations and other illegal activities. Michael Kelly is impressive as the only honest detective who is actually trying to serve justice, not some partisan, ulterior motives.    The story is tragic and painful. The cast is wonderful. Eastwood directs the movie with his usual sensitivity and punctuation. He also composed the beautiful, captivating music. This guy is something else.    This is the best movie I have seen this year. If you are seeking an emotional drama that will penetrate your heart, this one is for you.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|There has been a refreshing evolution.  I won't forget Chris & Billie and I truely miss David & Catherine, but Matt & Karen have that same hot spark.  I'm looking forward to their traditional Christmas special and eagerly await series 6.
B00241YHMU|5.0|There are magical movies, movies that enthrall you, capturing your soul and mind. This is the story of Benjamin Button, who was born with several aging diseases and experiences a unique life journey, opposed to what we know: Benjamin was born an old man, and as he grows up he becomes younger and younger until he completes a full life circle. Meanwhile, his family and friends are all getting old and, with the exception of the love of his life, Daisy, all die.     Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors' home. The movie opens with the last day of the Great War, and finishes with Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. With Benjamin we witness scenes from the Second World War, the 1960s (Beatles), New York Ballet, race relations in New Orleans. Benjamin Button is played by six different actors, mainly by Brad Pitt.     At the core this is a love story between Benjamin and Daisy, played by three actresses, mainly by Cate Blanchett who gives yet another superb performance. Benjamin, while away getting younger, had a short love affair with Elizabeth Abbott, played by another wonderful British actress, Tilda Swinton. There are many touching moments that touch your heart, but the most touching one is when Benjamin decides to leave his lover, and his one-year-old daughter, before she will be able to remember him. He wanted his daughter to have a real father, not one who grows to become a child as his daughter grows older.      David Fincher directed this movie with sensitivity and silky imagination. Alexandre Desplat's music is enchanting and moving. It's a beautiful score that promotes the many magical moments you experience while watching this long movie, 2:40 hours, yet I found myself hoping that the movie would never end. I highly recommend this Hollywood gem.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|If you go to the movies for escapism, to be thrilled and entertained then Unstoppable is definitely worth while.  If you want something dull, pedestrian and full of angst, the kind of film that should be made in Swedish with English sub-titles, go and see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1.  Tony Scott puts you in a position of high tension  -  and he keeps you there, ratcheting it up inexorably  -  while Denzel Washington and Chris Pine put in good sympathetic performances so that you care what happens to them (if you don't care, there's no tension).    I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would be happy to see it again  -  when my fingernails grow back.  Great fun.
0230707009|5.0|Danny Cartwright goes to a pub with his girlfriend and his closest friend. Here he goes down on his knees and asks his girlfriend to marry him. She agrees. A perfect night. Or not. A group of four young men are in the pub. Their leader likes the girl. He says some words he shouldn't say. An argument erupts. It is an unfair challenge. Four against two. But they all go out to the alley to fight. Danny's friend was stabbed by the leader, who implicates Danny. His three friends support his version of what had happened. Danny's girlfriend was not right there when the stabbing occurred. It is the word of four young and successful men against the word of Danny, a mechanic from the London lower class. Danny goes to jail.    This book does not let you go. It is masterfully written from the first page, until the last. Every small detail is important. I was hooked into the story and fate of Danny Cartwright from the first chapter. The pace of A Prisoner of Birth is unstoppable, with gripping twist and turns. It is about love, friendship, betrayal, revenge, the highs and lows of life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an entertaining read which provides insights into English class society and its prison life, and information about stamp collection.
B003EYVXSW|3.0|When I saw the preview for Splice, the first thing that came to my mind was that the movie looked like kind of a rip-off of that 1995 movie [[ASIN:B000F9RB9E Species]] that Natasha Henstridge walks around in half naked. And while there are indeed some major similarities between Splice and Species, I think that Splice Director Vincenzo Natali actually had another movie in mind when he wrote this movie.<br /><br />Back in the early 1930s if you were to play God and try to create life how would you do it? We'll, you'd do some grave robbing and try to bring back the dead with a little lightening, right? How else? Because cloning and gene splicing in the 30s was a concept as distant as an iPhone. It's so much easier today. Just take some animal DNA and mix it with a little human DNA, throw it in a Petri dish, incubate, let sit then voil&agrave;. It's alive....It's alive!!!<br /><br />Splice's Dr. Frankensteins are Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley respectfully as Clive and Elsa. (Get it? Colin Clive played the original Dr. Frankenstein and Elsa Lanchester was 1935's Bride.) Clive and Elsa are geneticists and they create their own Frankenstein and call her Dren. Being only half human, Dren has some superior physical powers and--who knew?--introduce a little animal (or bird?) DNA to a human sample and you get a more intelligent being as well. So look out: a stronger, intelligent life form could be hazardous to your health.<br /><br />I'm surprised that there are so many 1 star reviews for Splice on this page, because the movie isn't really that bad at all. Sure the movie deals with controversial topics, and Dren gets down and dirty with her makers in both a consenting (bestiality?) and non-consenting (rape) way. But questionable opinions and hard to watch sex scenes aside, I was entertained by Splice. There are times when you'll hear yourself saying, \\"That would never happen,\\" or \\"No one would ever really do that,\\" but the movie never gets boring.<br /><br />Splice is certainly no Frankenstein classic, but it is a pretty good Sci-fi flick and I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre.a pretty good Sci-fi flick and I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|As other reviewers have stated, \\"Strangers In The Night\\" is one of the greatest live albums ever recorded and commercially released by a rock group. I have been trying since 1978 to find a more intense guitar passage as the solo part in \\"Rock Bottom\\", and I'm still searching. Michael Schenker's playing is simply amazing. I'd swear that there are parts in his solo where he's literally playing faster than I can hear. Now, a lot of guitar players can play fast -  but only a select few can do it with the style, fluidity and delicacy that he can. Plus, I always get a smile on my face when I hear Phil Mogg saying \\"What?!?...you got it...OK this is something called 'Ruck Buttum'...\\" ;~)  It truly is a shame that UFO was never given the acclaim that they so richly deserved, this entire album is a testament to their ability to rock with the best of 'em. I'm just thankful that they left us with this gem. Worth every penny!
B00275EGWY|1.0|The story line is good but it is not a cup of tea for everyone. The pace of the movie is slow and quite dry at times. The ending is somehow  \\"open ended\\".

0786868724|3.0|I think this was a good book, but not as touching as \\"Tuesdays with Morrie.\\" It provided an interesting look at how we might inadvertently judge people (especially those with shadowy pasts or different religions).

B003WKFAIW|5.0|I absolutely love Maroon5, \\"Hands All Over\\", CD.  The songs stick in your head.  Every song has the most awesome beat. I dance/exercise to it every day and find myself exercising longer because of the beat. I go to turn it off, but it makes me want to dance some more.  Hahaha!  It makes cooking dinner and doing chores fun, too. I was first turned on to it when I heard the song, \\"Hands All Over\\", on the show, \\"Medium\\".  It even has a song with Lady Antebellum on it, which is very good.  I've never heard of her before because I don't listen to that kind of music. I would highly recommend this CD!

B0000028VT|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest albums of all time. Music Box is such an appropriate title for this album. Before I purchased this CD, I already had Dreamlover and Hero downloaded, and I loved those songs.     To me, Mariah has always had some form of RnB in her music weather its full blown \\"obsessed\\" or \\"Someday\\". In my opinion, I like her best when her music crosses between pop mixed with rnb, right down the middle. Of course she can do both but this album and Daydream are magical.    My favorites are:  1. All I've ever wanted/music box/Just to hold you once again  2. Now that I know/Anytime you need a friend  3. NEVER FORGET YOU/I've been thinking about you    I don't know why but this album is so soft but yet so powerful at the same time, you can put some songs like \\"all I've ever wanted\\" and \\"music box\\" on before bedtime. They are very dreamy.
B0044LK8J4|5.0|An instant classic!  It is SO SO much better than the usual Christmas albums you constantly hear playing.  It's totally original, with sumptuous orchestration and the singer's voice couldn't be more appealing.

B00406UK7S|4.0|Note. This is an edited version of the original. The rating has not changed but the text has.  Here's the scoop.  The Roman army, in its quest to conquer Northern England's Picts, gets outsmarted by its enemy and the entire army is reduced to a small handful of men who must now muscle their way back to safety.  Director Neil Marshall takes a few tips form Ridley Scott in this sprawling Roman era epic. This is sort of like &#34;The Warriors&#34; meets &#34;Gladiator.&#34; Our guys need to get to safety and, one by one, their numbers dwindle as they get closer to their goal. This film has a good look. If you recall the opening battle scene in &#34;Gladiator&#34; much of that same color palette is used throughout this film. Marshall does intercut it with some scenes which are much brighter and bathed in a lovely green so things don't remain too dismal. And overall his great use of the various landscapes, mountains, cliffs, rivers, valleys adds great scope to the film.  The action here is surprisingly bloody and gory. During the various skirmishes Marshall doesn't merely want to show the kill, he wants to show it in all its bloody glory. You see any number of decapitations, throat cuttings and dismemberments in crude detail. I liked it but this is definitely more of a guy flick.  I suppose some can argue poor character development. At first viewing I agreed. But I've now seen it three times and have become much more comfortable with all the main characters. Olga Kurlyenko and Dominic West do a fine job with their parts of the script. Kurlyenko particularly because she's so striking in her appearance. the other characters aren't drawn as well but they read better than they did upon first watch. Even Michael Fassbender, who seemed to melt into the crowd originally, shined better upon repeat viewings. Marshall could have helped them with more closeups. With all the mud and blood covering everyone and everything the medium and long shots hindered viewer's ability to establish who these guys are.  This is one heck of a flick. It moves well. I never once looked at my watch. It has a good look, good action, great bad guys and a lot of nifty turns. If these sorts of movies are your poison, this should do you in.
B00003CXZ4|3.0|If a movie can be deemed a \\"Thriller\\" or a \\"Mystery\\" this would be it,people who have seen Nolan's work(with the exception of Dark Knight)The Prestige being a prime example and a movie I enjoyed more than this.I am not sure if it is Guy Pearce(not his performance) or the back and fourth of the plot,Joe Pantoliano puts in a good performance,it is a sad movie to me really and a bizarre one.I was pleasantly surprised by a cameo by Thomas Lennon(Lt.Dangle of Reno 911!),I think the idea of the movie and the story is right,but the overall execution of the film and especially the ending is what keeps me from even bothering to wrap my noodle around it once more or even bother to question it,I am not a lazy movie guy or a simpleton but I think sometimes people want to make something seem \\"Intelligent\\" when overall it is a regurgitated story going over and over again,That's not to say my experience or feelings about it takes anything from the work on the contrary many would be intrigued and might even like it,I neither like it nor hate it, I am indifferent towards the movie.

006145205X|4.0|My Dearest Matthew, you've nearly done it.  You're so close.  You've almost written the first evolutionary science book that properly incorporates the need for economic freedom.  All you need to do now is take that glorious open mind of yours and spend six months in earnest studying the moral arguments of Murray Rothbard and the rest of the Austrian economists.  Once you are armed with an ironclad understanding of money and banking, as well as the causes of the boom-bust cycle, you will be able to release \\"The Rational Optimist 2: Revised and Expanded.\\"  In doing so, you will have finally accomplished what no human being (that I know of) has yet been able to do:  Offer the world's first complete and true Bible of Reason, a comprehensive guide that shows us once and for all that we need no intelligent designer (god) to explain where we've come from, and we need no intelligent designer (government) to take us where we ought to want to go.  Evolution is real, and it works.  Don't be afraid to follow it all the way through to its logical economic conclusions.  May you find the last piece of your enlightenment puzzle and use it to make the world a better and smarter place for us all.
B002ZG98PA|4.0|\\"Tangled\\", by all means, represents Disney's return to the true princess fairy tales since decades.  Last year's \\"The Princess and The Frog\\" may seem like a princess tale due to the title itself, but it was a princess tale based on technicalities and loopholes (which, btw, were pretty clever approaches to that movie's story); it's Disney's return to traditional animated films, but not a proper return to the golden era where marketable animated girls of royal background take center stage.  \\"Tangled\\" actually is, and this film feels very reminiscent to Disney's hand-drawn classics, even though it's computer-animated: it has a chivalric setting, vibrant scenery, a female lead who wishes for something more, a dashing hero/rebel, an evil step-mother, songs of whimsy, goofy comic-reliefs, 'dreams come true' speeches, and a valiant story filled with contrived set-ups and implausibilit---I mean, filled with magic. Not only does it capture these elements with a sense of nostalgia that will cater to the old as well as the young (fun for the whole family and all), it manage to be refreshing and bold while staying true to its roots.<br /><br />Typing from someone who has seen more than his share of fairy tale movies than he's willing to admit, this has a by-the-books story; not a lot of surprises to be had from a narrative standpoint, but then again, Disney doesn't enjoy subverting its own formula.  It has its leads, they go on a journey (trials and romance abound), and the simple audience gets what they want.  But much like \\"The Social Network\\", which is also formulaic in its story, this film manages to be very good because of its execution.<br /><br />For one thing, it's the musical numbers.  Being an animated musical, and also the first computer-animated musical made by Disney, one has to face the fallacies of [[ASIN:6305236585 embarrassingly weak songs]] and [[ASIN:B00005UJ9X tacked-on musical transitions]]; Disney movies aren't really known by them, but I can't say its characters suddenly go into song really makes sense to me.  However, Disney managed to step up its game by making the act of singing an integral part of this movie's plot.  See, the evil Gothel had to sing to a magical macguffin flower so she won't grow old, and when she kidnapped Rapuznel as a child and raise her as her own daughter due to backstory-related reasons regarding that flora of youth, Gothel made her sing so her [[ASIN:B001YHX4B0 magical hair]] can glow and revitalize Gothel's age; since Gothel and the now-legal age Rapunzel made chirping a tune routine, their singing came naturally for them.  There was also a well-crafted musical number that took place in a saloon, where all the grunts and vikings were singing about their dreams; one of the lead characters didn't want to sing, but they threatened him to sing anyway, which made the number delightfully humorous.  If there's one musical number I thought was 'tacked on', it's the \\"I See the Light\\" sequence...and yet it's not tacked on; it's hard to explain, but maybe because the sequence itself is so enchanting, it can get away with being tacky.  For the most part, the musical sequences were excellently handled.<br /><br />Comparing to \\"Princess and Frog\\", character-wise, the leads in this film were more engaging and interesting than Tiana and Naveen.  But when it comes to villains, Gothel is pretty weak compared to the conniving Shadow Man.  While I appreciate that she treated her 'daughter' with some degree of humanity compared to other Disney step-mothers, her obsession to keep Rapunzel secluded in a tall tower for the sake of eternal youth made her appear less sinister and more [[ASIN:B00005J6RD Joan Crawford]].  Back to the leads, Flynn the dashing thief has to be the smuggiest smug-face smuggers I've ever smuggin' seen this side of Dreamworks; even when he had a change of heart, found a person that's more important to him than what he stole and all that usual character development, he still had that arrogant smirk.  However, I grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.  There's a strong chemistry between him and Rapunzel, and there's a lot of joy to be had from those two; the funniest scene of the film happened when Flynn took Rapunzel out of her tower for the first time and she goes through a schizophrenic blast of exuberance and misery while Flynn just sulks, which was ingenious in both comic delivery and juxtaposition.  Nice that the movie took the \\"Aladdin\\" approach in having the animal sidekicks not talk but rely on physical gestures to give them personality, and I really dig the chameleon as well as the brave steed; they don't hog much of the screen time, but that's a good thing.<br /><br />I'm amazed at how the Disney princess archetype has evolved over the years.  The likes of Snow White and Cinderella don't have much in the way of multi-layered personalities outside of being kind and pretty (or [[ASIN:B000VAR0T8 Belldandy]]), and it's only until \\"The Little Mermaid\\" that princesses started to have some depth to them; although, the deepest some can go is being assertive and independent, pretty much the 'woman in a man's world' mentality that grew to succession in reality.  And then comes Rapunzel, a proper evolution to the stereotype.  She's such an amazing character, because she has that dainty innocence as the old princesses as well as the defiant attitude of new princesses; it all says she's a woman in heart and body, but can still hold her ground, which is more than I can say about many tough action girls.  Rapunzel also has some unique quirks to give her distinction, like her hyperactivity; she's practically a child, going bananas at all the new things she sees or wanted to see.  The fact that her life was explored from the beginning made me understand her, made her compelling as she journeys not only to know her past, but to maturity.  No doubt she's right up there with Jasmine as one of the best Disney princesses.<br /><br />Again, \\"Tangled\\" is following a familiar tale, but such familiarity comes with great characters, a solid adventure that's clever and exciting, moments of levity and grim, and a resolution that, while not quite as good in the same manner as \\"Wall-E\\", is so moving that it's worth suspending one's predictions.  The songs themselves are very moving; each song is catchy, energetic, and easily inviting.  These compliments come as no surprise since Alan Menken composed for this movie, who also wrote music for most of the Disney Renaissance films and had a history of turning sappy love ballads into diamonds.  Speaking of, \\"I See the Light\\" is personally the highlight of the soundtrack, a sublimity that owes much from \\"A Whole New World\\". I really like this song and I can't wait to see the accolades it deserves, and I can't wait for [[ASIN:B000B58D08 America]] to try and ruin it in a few years; good thing I have a frying pan to beat myself senseless when the latter happens.grew to like him because he can be charismatic with his one-liners and when he does his heroic deeds later on.

B002ZG97EC|5.0|I have only three words to say:  \\"Butt...butt...butt...\\"    (OK, that was really only one word repeated three times.)    This movie is Big Fun for young and old alike.  My sincere advice is to get all over it right now.  Best cartoon of 2010, which is saying a lot in a year that also included the likes of Toy Story 3, MegaMind, and How to Train Your Dragon.  But only Despicable Me has the linguistic stylings of one Russell Brand, so it gets the nod here.
B0049D1TCM|3.0|I still can't believe it and I've had the album since it dropped. I expected Pink Friday to be a landmark Hip-Hop release and instead it's a rip-off for hardcore Nicki fans. It's mostly Pop garbage. Roman's Revenge, Blazin, Moment 4 Life, and Muny are my faves and I wish Massive Attack as well as a last minute, recently freed Wayne feature was included. An all female posse cut with Trina, Da Brat, MC Lyte and others would have been very nice also. Instead, we get an album full of Your Love and Right Thru Me clones. I won't lie. Some of these songs are too wack and disappointing for me to listen to all the way through. It's like Lil Kim meets Lady GaGa meets Rihanna (who shows up on the pillow soft Fly) meets Ke$ha meets Pink meets.....you get the point. It also feels as if Nicki dumbs down her skills on some songs in an attempt to please mainstream listeners. Combining various musical genres with Hip-Hop can be creative and lots of fun. Pink Friday on the other hand is a goofy, unorganized mess with very little Hip-Hop involved. Buy it only if you dig this sort of thing. If not, buy Kanye's new one instead.
B001FB55H6|5.0|Finally a hero movie for me. In real life the only thing missing is the heroes. Death destruction mayhem shock and sex are all here. Heroes you love & heroes you hate plus villains you just feel sorry for in a way. I love this film.
B003QCCS36|5.0|Ray has an awesome voice and his song writing is deep and meaningful and great to listen to.  Always has been.  But, I believe with the introduction of the Pariah Dogs....his songs have matured to solid, tight good music.  Don't get me wrong...his previous CDs were all good too.  However, with some of the previous CDs...some of the tracks just seemed to be a really quiet acoustic guitar with a kind of monotonous melody....or other efforts seemed to be searching for a sound...like some of the tracks of Gossip in the Grain ( too many horns and other instruments fighting for attention).      GWATCDR is his best effort IMHO.  The reasons?....we'll his amazing voice and songwriting is now coupled with really good music and melodies.  I mean song after song.  I never thought I'd be a 'pedal steel' fan.  But the way they incorporate the steel guitar into these songs, coupled with the just loud enough electric guitar droning its punctuations and solos...is perfect.  The song Devil's in the Jukebox throws in a resonator ( doe bro ) guitar ( perfect for the bluesy feel of the song).    Some songs are basically all acoustic...like Can I come home for the Summer....which is a beautiful song.  Some people have said Ray's gone a bit country with this CD.  To be sure, there may be some country influences....but no mistake, you aren't going to hear anything about pickups and rail road tracks on this CD.  No, as usual, Ray's lyrics and approach are heart moving, thought provoking songs about human loss, love and the human condition.  Wonderful stuff when, ,like I said, combined with the awesome instrumentals.  And almost all songs are awesome,  New York City's..., God Willin and the Creek don't Rise ( which is my favorite, it's a short song and comes across as a letter from a guy pushing cattle in the range to his sweet heart back home that he'll be home soon one day if he doesn't die first) Beg, Borrow, Steel, Can I Come Home for the Summer, Old Before my Time, and Devil in the Jukebox are the best.    To sum it up;  Ray's singing ( which has always been so unique in this day and age) is still great...coupled with wonderful melodies and tunes....make for a superb listening experience that I have been listening to almost every single day since buying the CD a week ago.
0143058525|2.0|I am so dissapointed in this book.  I normally like chick books.  In fact, I'm pro-chick flics and pro-chick books, so I was surprised to find out that this books wasn't what I thought it was going to be.  I haven't finished the book yet, and I don't know that I can finish it.  If it gets any worse, I'm going to have to pull the plug on it.  I was told that her time spent in Italy is fun, and that India is a little boring.  Well, I'm still listening to her time in Italy and if India is even more boring, I know I'm going to pull the plug.  Also, the narrator leaves a lot to be desired.  Her reading is very dull.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this book.  I haven't watched the movie, but it has to be better than the book.  Normally I like the book better than the movie.  This may be the first case where I like the movie the best.

B002ZG999U|4.0|My only complaint about this movie is that it's too dark during most of the action scenes, but it's pretty good popcorn movie fun. Watching Rocky team up with action legends from the past and present is a treat. Rated R, but should have been PG-13 (the violence wasn't intense and the language wasn't too raw).
0517548232|5.0|Let me start by saying this book is excellent. It covers many of the fallacies that plague our current government and society. My kids, who are too young now to read and understand, will be required to read this before they leave home. Check out mises.org for audio lectures covering most of these topics. Austrian economics a.k.a. free-market economics is easy to understand if you take the time to educate yourself. This was my first economics book and won't be my last!
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I fell in love with this band with the first album, and Blackbird managed to surpass its predecessor (arguably, they're both wonderful albums). The title track is a masterpiece, in my opinion, the sort of tracks you don't see much in rock anymore, Ties That Bind is amazing, etc. I would go so far to say that this is easily in my top 5 favorite albums of all time. Highest recommendation.
B004498KPU|5.0|This collection is packed with unseen videos and complete versions of the vintage ones, however, one thing that kills this collection is the sound. I have no idea if this is a defective set or all of them are like that. When played with a sound system, it goes from a full rich sound to a lesser rich sound of and on through out the entire collection.    I will request a replacement.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|Is there anyone around who remembers when DVDs first came out and you had to FLIP the disc half way through to see a whole movie? This was solved by the advent of reverse spiral technology (which is why DVDs pause slightly half way through so the disc can start reading backwards from the center of the disc -- much better than having to get up and FLIP it). Before the DVD format went universal, DVD fanatics had a standing joke about the new reverse spiral technology: \\"You know you are a DVD junkie when you drive to work forwards and then drive home backwards.\\" Hopefully, you get my drift. Heck, we even used to make lists of when the pause happened in all the new DVDS coming out, we were so grateful there were no more flippers!    Sadly, this new Avatar set brings back the days of yore by making us get up and change discs to see the whole film. Now we're not just flipping, we have to juggle multiple discs as well! Avatar is one giant leap for the movies, but this new Blu-Ray set is two giant leaps backward in time to a place we never want to go back to again. Return to the future takes on a whole new meaning.    If I could give this item NO STARS I would have done it on this principle alone (as there was no reason to split the movie -- each version should have been put on its own disc), not to mention the packaging which scratches and ruins the discs before you can even take them out to play them.     The first iteration of Avatar on Blu-Ray had player issues which unfortunately still have not been addressed. When it does play there is a lot of skipping, which appears to be chapter rather than scratch related.    Am glad I had the chance to try this set out before purchasing it. I want to purchase it, but only after they get it right.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is by far the best blu ray concert I own. It is not often the picture sound direction and artist performance come together all at once to make the perfect concert video. Awesome job!
0743497465|3.0|Hmmm. I have to think about this. I know that many people say that Dan Brown's writing jarrs their literary veins, and he makes every mistake authors are told to be careful of. But, he is able to write a page-turner that you can't put down, filled with action albeit some a little improbable, that you get so caught up in you don't care if he uses the word 'coffee' five times on a page and overplays the adverb hand. You don't care, you just want to find out what is going to happen next. If it's highly improbable, so what, it takes your mind off the stresses of your life as you read about the stresses the hero has to endure. Dan Brown offers pure escapism and Deception Point is exactly that. He doesn't care about using perfect metaphors, he doesn't want to be a literary guru. All he wants to do, is write bestsellers that make people forget about their own stinking lives. That makes him money, so why should he care that people criticise his writing style? Deception Point is fast-paced, the action flows off the page and you are quickly caught up in the story. So what if it reads like a Hollywood script, it works. I won't say this is one of the best books I've ever read, but it did occupy my weekend and take my mind off all the crap at work.  dan brown definitely has the page-turning recipe down pat.
B004132I4S|1.0|Picture Prince as a white indie rocker oboist using very outdated and lame electronic techniques that go on forever. I bought this cd at target for ten bucks and felt like I'd paid to be barfed on. Utterly unlistenable...
B0036EH3X4|5.0|My wife gave me the first 5 seasons on Blu-Ray for Christmas 2009. By October of 2010 I had watched 0 episodes. Then I had major back surgery and couldn't do anything but sit for 6 weeks. So after the 1st episode I was LOST. I am so thankful that I didn't have to try to keep up with week-to-week episodes. Being able to watch the whole thing as an extended movie was terrific and I highly recommend it. Oh, yeah, I wound up ordering the final season as a gift to myself for all my pain and suffering (I do not suggest major back surgery for people with a low pain threshold). The show was better than oxycodone for controlling my pain. I'll leave alone the hokiest part of the whole show, the \\"smoke monster\\", and take a look at the rest of the plot/themes. It was an excellent show, nothing glaringly out of place scientifically or time-line wise. Some of the acting is downright outstanding and most of it is passable. Of course all the women are good looking and the men are strong and no comment about the children. I recommend this show to anyone with an open mind and a lot of time on their hands to enjoy it in an immediate way.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I was VERY late to the game on this show, but even with all the hype and awards, it still exceeded my expectations. I can't believe it's on tv not just for its dark subject matter and violence, but because it's so much better than most feature films! The direction, cinematography, editing, acting - it's all the best of the best, and NOT just \\"for tv.\\" BEST SHOW ON TELEVISION. Believe it yo.
B00013RC8O|2.0|This is a bad movie on all kinds of levels, but it has its moments of interest.<br /><br />Bad stuff: Barry Newman leads the list here. A stiff actor incapable of doing anything to flesh out the character. Newman has little to work with in terms of script, but good actors can do things even with poorly-written parts. The \\"climax\\" of Newman's role is when he stops the car and decides what his fate should be. Newman makes it look like he's deciding whether to super-size his order of fries.<br /><br />The amped-up social commentary is stupid. The Cleavon Little role is absurd. The homophobia is sick. The glorification of Hell's Angel's is laughable (see Altamont). The blatant rip-offs of \\"Easy Rider\\" and \\"The Chase\\" could serve as foundations for lawsuits. And no one who knows San Francisco calls it (or called it) \\"Frisco.\\"<br /><br />The film does have its highlights. (1) The car. The 1970 Dodge Challenger is the star of the movie. I must say, I've wanted a white 1970 Dodge Challenger since I first saw this movie in 1971, and I still want one in 2010 having re-watched the film. It's the ultimate American muscle car, produced at a golden moment just before the oil shock of 1973. For another film depiction of American muscle car culture at its best see the red Mustang in \\"Diamonds Are Forever.\\" (2) Dean Jagger. He is on the screen for, what, 5 or 10 minutes, but delivers a memorable, funny, funky performance that shows what a good actor can do with a few scraps of material. It's one of the three or four best portrayals ever offered on film of a certain classic American type, the desert rat, out there in the desert prospecting, scavenging, surviving. (For another such character see the first half-hour of \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"  3) The nude woman on the motorcycle - this is truly hilarious and kind of hot. (You can watch it. Google \\"vanishing point nude.\\") She's sort of a wet-dream fantasy of what people in 1970 thought that hippie chicks were like, i.e., nude free spirits who were eager to screw anyone who came along, smiled, and looked a bit stoned. There's a similar hippie chick in \\"The French Connection\\" (on a bicycle; not nude, though). Let me say, the Vanishing Point hippie gal is gonna get badly hurt if she falls off that motorcycle. The director should have dressed her in a pair of tight leather chaps - JUST tight leather chaps, nuthin' else.
B001O54NKS|5.0|In my opinion this CD was their best work they ever did together...I don't blame George Lynch for moving on and doing his own thing, he was amazing in Lynch Mob.   Dokken was and always will be memorable with the original line up playing together.     My wife and I use to listen to Dokken together when were dating...We been together for 25 years and married for 15 years and still love listening to it because it brings back memories when we were younger.    This is a great CD!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Scar Tissue is the story from beginning to end of Anthony Kiedis' experiences growing up, entering the music scene, relapsing and meeting his many loves. The reader gets the feeling that you may actually be getting to know the really front man, Kiedis. Kiedis' diction allows you to really hear how he speaks and tells stories. He's a great storyteller and has an amazing memory despite the drug use. I highly recommend this book for it's style, adventures and rock history.
B000089RV6|5.0|By far Back in Black was ACDC epic album...The entire album (CD) is great from beginning to end...They were at the top of their game making this one. I also own Black Ice and that one takes a lot of characteristics from Back in Black.    I've listen to ACDC for ever and granted Bon Scott was a perfect fit in the very early days RIP but this album was a giant leap forward in what they had done before this...    If I had to pick 5 all time albums ever made Back in Black would be in it.

6304806418|5.0|Some of the reviews here seem to imply that Antonio Banderas is effective in his role and keeps the film moving well, but not a really good singer.  I suggest listening to \\"High Flying, Adored\\" especially.  His voice is excellent in pitch and quality. Antonio is a terrific singer in addition to being smolderingly attractive and a fine actor. This movie is perfectly cast and a total jewel in all ways.  Very underrated due, I think, to prejudice against Madonna.  I am not especially a Madonna fan but I totally respect and admire her excellent achievement as Evita in this all around first-rate film.  Favorite scene: Waltz for Eva and Che.  Great chemistry!

B003YUC2FE|5.0|Toy Story was an iconic movie from the 90's, and when the second and third arrived expanding on the brilliant storytelling, that touches the heart, this trilogy is a must for any true movie aficionado.

B003NFM3JU|5.0|I liked all aspects of this movie. I have seen at least 5 versions of this movie and I liked this probably the best. 3D puts you in the movie. This is our favorite 3D movie. Enjoy.
B0042AEOG0|1.0|Don't buy it if you're expecting it to be like her first CD. It's definitely a different style and not at all what I was hoping to hear in her second CD. Personally I felt the first CD was better.
0765326353|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  The King is assassinated, flash forward six years later in a war of retribution that has turned into a stalemate.  A contest for expensive Gemstones rather than each side trying to beat the other.  The plot itself, is a simple one and sets the stage for an epic that will span over several books.  At the heart of this story, are the characters and how they are entwined in the struggle and the events to come.  That is the true gem of this book, the characters.  There can be no complaint for lack of character development in this story.  You will grow to love them...or hate them depending on your perspective.  Sanderson understands the true meaning of the word \\"honor\\" and knows how to project that to his main characters.  If you dream of reading stories of honor and sacrafice of old then you will not be disappointed.      There are no Dwarves or Elves in this novel. Sanderson has created a unique world onto itself.  It's interesting to learn about how it works and the writer does a good job of telling the story while not overloading you with information on how that world works.  He gives you just enough and spreads it out throughout the novel so it's easy to follow.    The book isn't without it's flaws but we are talking about a thousand page book that I never got bored with and was able to finish in just a few weeks despite a busy schedule.  I'm not suggesting Sanderson is Shakespear, Dickens, or Cooper but for what the book is, a wonderful fantasy novel, it deserves nothing less than five stars.  I'll even admit I still have a hard time believing men are not allowed to read or write yet rule Kingdoms but I'm willing to let it play out and see how it goes.      This is not your traditional fantasy novel but that's probably one of the reasons why I would recommend it.  Hopefully Sanderson will not leave us hanging for years on end between novels like some do.
1442336390|5.0|From the moment I started reading I was hooked. I couldn't put the book down. Her style of writing really took me inside her brain and I felt like I was on the journey with her. She really captured how the mind can take over and rule your life, taking away all commmon sense or feeling of reality. I liked it so much I bought the audio and listen to it in my car and on my mp3 player. Listening to it in her own voice brings you even more in sync with her. I have picked up more and more detail that I didn't retain in the book, so I'm glad I got it. It is a must read for anyone who has or knows anyone who has an eating disorder, OCD, or any other control issues or anyone who just wants to read a good book. I give her alot of credit and respect for putting her story out there for the world to read. For someone who was so vulnerable and afraid of what people thought of her, this is a milestone in her recovery. I wish her well and hope she writes another book soon.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|This film originally done in B&W was colorized in this set and it's not a mistake (done by Legend Films)...the colors are done to perfection.  The collection here presents 2 DVD's and a CD of the music as well.  All in its original uncut glory! However, the actors, music and storyline are the key to this films success. You can hear the history of Irving Berlin's best songs as they play out in this movie (listen closely and you'll hear familiar music used in the movie White Christmas.  Majorie Reynolds holds her own with Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire (remaining cast Walter Reed and Virginia Dale...not to mention Louise Beavers an incrdible character actress were all excellent.)<br /><br />For the present day, the dialogue still holds its own with sarcasim and witty bantor between the actors makes for a well rounded top of the line musical.  This is not a Christmas movie per se; however, it's themes begin and end in the Christmas period (perhaps making it seem like it is...the film debut was in August 1942 in NY.)<br /><br />At any rate, well worth the watching and seeing year after year...Don't get worse, grab your nurse...And come to Holiday Inn!

B000E1ZBH2|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is the best production of the Jane Austen classic, ever. Of course, I am a man, and adore Keira Knightly. Women who like Colin Firth may prefer the other version from a few years further back.
0061914177|5.0|I've read books by Brian Solis, Tara Hunt, Chris Brogan and the other major thought leaders in social media. But Gary Vaynerchuk's \\"Crush It\\" offers what is easily the most practical and useful approach.<br /><br />Gary emphasizes passion over perfection, hard work over short cuts, and intuition over analytics. He offers a simple (but not easy) game plan that anyone can put into action right now. Given his success in social media as both a wine expert and a branding coach, it obviously works. (Check out his Klout score)<br /><br />I read his book every evening to remind myself what needs to be done. I'm spending a lot more time with social media and enjoying it more. My standing in social media grows stronger every week by employing Gary's methods.<br /><br />Can't wait for his next book, \\"The Thank You Economy.\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0061914185 The Thank You Economy]]
B001UV4XFG|1.0|This was complete and absolute spunk!  The actors in particular Kristen Stewart are getting worse.  I thought that by the time the 3rd film rolled around they would have rounded into the characters.  Sadly this was not the case.  This was like parody of a bad movie.  I can't believe they haven't considered replacing KS and RP...sure they are easy on the eyes but that's about as far as it goes.
B00007E8NM|5.0|What an incredible example of trio improvisation!  The solos are beautiful and the groove is really solid - even without a drummer! - as others have mentioned.  This album is a very pleasant listen and shows what can happen when three superb players blend superbly.  If you like swing and \\"straight ahead\\" jazz, you will probably enjoy this album a lot.
1439107955|5.0|I am a 62 year old medical oncologist.  During my 36 year career I have been a physician of cancer patients, a laboratory-based molecular pharmacologist, a research administrator and now I am dipping my toe into the world of health policy.  But before I was any of those things, I was and always will be a doctor.  Obviously, that journey from medical school to the present encompassed much of the history of man's ability to alter the natural history of malignant diseases.  When I graduated from medical school, our technology would have resulted in Lance Armstrong having died, thousands of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia having died, and hundreds of thousands of children with leukemia having died.  Instead, they are alive.  How that happened and who made it happen are in this book.  I am not a player in this story, but I was surrounded and taught by many of those who are:  Tom Frei, Jay Freiriech, Moshe Talpaz, Vince DaVita, Joe Burchenal, Hagop Kantarjian have all been parts of my life and all are parts of this story of our permanent campaign in the War on Cancer.    Dr. Mukherjee (full disclosure, we have recently become friends) has really done our profession an invaluable service in compiling the story of cancer from ancient times to the present and made it come alive with characters who made my professional life so fulfilling and never boring.  I know there were a lot more stories where these came from and would love to read the rest of them.    Dr. Mukherjee chooses, very wisely, I think, to center his tale around his experiences as a medical oncologist with his patients and Sidney Farber's experiences with his patients as he makes the first in-roads against disseminated human malignancy using chemotherapy, then partners with Mary Lasker to create the War on Cancer in 1971.    This is a terrific book.  It should be required reading for all cancer doctors, but also for the rest of us.  So many Americans will have to confront this disease in a loved oneor themselves.  If you want to know where we came from in oncology, where we are today and where we are likely to go---READ THIS BOOK!  Best book I have read this year?  Without a doubt!

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I will admit to having a bit of an obsession with Josh Groban. I check in on his web site regularly to see what is going on, and I follow him on Twitter. So I've been following the making of this album for quite a while, and was anxiously awaiting its release. My husband, who does not share my obsession, even bought me the Special Edition CD from the JG web site for my birthday, and just about every day I regale my mother with the latest funny thing Josh said on Twitter, or the progress they were making on the album. I have been emotionally invested in the making of this album for quite a while.    When they first released \\"Hidden Away,\\" I was a little taken aback, because this just wasn't what I've come to expect from Josh Groban. But as I listened to it again, without preconceptions, I realized I did like it. In fact, I liked it a lot. When the next song, \\"Voce Existe Em Mim,\\" was released, I liked it immediately, and I've liked all the other songs, as well. I view this album very favorably. There are some songs I like more than others, and some of the lyrics don't make sense to me at first, but overall I think it's a great album. I don't mind not understanding the lyrics initially, though, because the words aren't just thrown in my face. I have to think about them, and we are all free to form our own opinions as to what did Josh mean by that? I think he is pretty enigmatic with his lyrics, and that's not a bad thing. I think the only words that really, really bug me are in \\"Galileo\\" with the phrase \\"and thank the guy\\". I know that is not one of the songs that Josh co-wrote, but the word just seems out of place. I know it rhymes, and I don't know what other word could be used instead, but it grates on me. I like the song - I just have a problem with the way that particular line was worded.    I love \\"The Bells of New York City.\\" I live in Connecticut, and I used to go down to NYC several times every year to see a Broadway show. I know the magic that the city can hold, especially in winter, and I recall leaving the city on our bus and feeling a little sad about having to go. As we drove away, I would watch the receding lights and imagine what it would be like to live there. He captured that feeling so well.     I had a difficult time at first with War At Home. I could not listen to it without getting choked up, and when I tried to read the lyrics to my mother, I just burst out crying. I come out of the Vietnam War era, and had many classmates and friends who went to war there, and either did not come back, or came back to a very different reality. The song just tapped into a part of me that I hadn't looked at for a long time. I understand he was motivated to write this song by a visit to Walter Reed, but the song is really timeless - it holds true for all wars. I found it interesting that he wrote about them being back home and still being at war, although a very different kind of war. I can imagine a soldier coming home with PTSD or traumatic brain injury and being told that \\"you're a lucky one\\", because he's still alive, and still has all his limbs. Sometimes it's the wounds we can't see that are the most difficult to heal. The most pertinent line from the song, I thought, was \\"he's our unlearned lesson.\\" Yup.    I got introduced to Josh Groban's music indirectly by my mother. She's liked his music from when he first got started, and has all his albums. She pre-ordered the CD, and when I asked her what she thought of it, she told me she hated it. He was straining his voice. The piano chords were too loud. He was a lousy songwriter - it seemed to her that he just pushed out whatever they came up with, and that the lyrics were just plain stupid. Pretty rough, but I've seen a few reviews on here that are pretty much along those same lines.     I think that people have very definite attitudes about him. He is not a middle-of-the-road performer. You either love him, or hate him. I have one friend that just can't stand him at all, and another friend who is as passionate about him (his music, I mean) as I am. People seem to have strong opinions about him - one way or the other. I have a theory that Liberals are the ones that like Illuminations, and Conservatives are the ones who don't. I'm only half-joking, because he doesn't fit into a set mold and he's always willing and eager to mix things up a bit, and not let himself get pigeon-holed. From the negative reviews that I've read, there seemed to be a central theme - why did he walk away from what made him so successful, and how could he be so self-indulgent as to make an album like this?     My sister said she didn't care what Josh sang - he could sing row, row, row your boat, and it would still sound good. So my mother sent her CD to my sister - Mom just didn't even want to keep it. After my sister heard it, she sent a note to Mom (and bcc: me) that just said \\"row, row, row your boat.\\"    P.S.    The Grammy awards were held tonight. I didn't watch them - I only saw the previews, but I was surprised and disappointed that Josh and Illuminations were not nominated. I looked at who some of the nominees were, and thought they must be joking. Josh is so much more talented than most of them there - and I couldn't stop thinking about why this hadn't happened for him. Then I looked at a listing of the nominees, and one thing that struck me was that there were a lot of caricatures up for awards. Trying to sing is only part of their shtick - being outrageous (in either appearance or performance - or both) seemed to be the thing they were selling. At least that's how it looked to me. I mean - Justin Bieber? Lady Gaga? Well, she's definitely an entertainer, I'm not sure what Justin is, but I don't think he's very talented. But then, I'm not 14 years old.    We know a few things about Josh that may be the reason the Grammy has eluded him. Nobody will argue that he's got a beautiful voice - possibly the best voice out today in any category. But he does his thing - especially more so with Illuminations. Beautiful as they are, some people are turned off by the foreign language songs he sings. I don't know why, but I've seen that mentioned several times. Another thing is - he's not flashy. Usually when you see him perform he's in some kind of long-sleeved tee in a dark color, jeans and his boots. He does the suit thing when required for a specific performance, but his usual get-up is jeans and tee. And with his longish curly hair and stubble of a beard, he's not exactly out there suiting up for Saturday Night Fever.    But that's him. And as sorry as I am (and probably plenty of other people) that he didn't get any Grammy nominations, I bet it doesn't bother him that much. He's said numerous times that he's more proud of this project than any other he's done. If you can go away from a project like Illuminations and feel really good about what you did - is a Grammy going to really matter all that much?
B003ZJJFKE|4.0|What can I say? It is Joe Satriani!<br />His albums are always high quality creativity in his guitar instrumental style. As all of his work, it is a guitar player who best can appreciate what he does. If you are not a fan of instrumental rock, you may not be getting your head around this. Just listen to some of the song samples.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|This is a Christmas gift so I really can't give it a review until it is opened and watched.  The shipping was fast and in good condition though.
B003EPPEP4|5.0|What a talent! As she herself says, she's not only a jazz singer but she sings everything. It's her interpretation plus her huge and pure voice that sets her apart and she's only 16, cute as a button and will be at the top of her game for as long as she wants. Can't wait for her next recording.
1401307450|5.0|It always seems that we never get to know a famous person. We see glimpses of them in Los Angeles or New York, sometimes in concert or whatever, but we never see them behind-the-scenes (unless you have the privilege of having part of a movie filmed in your hometown and can see the actors in the local sandwich shop buying a Turkey BLT). Anyway. This book is not like that. Anthony Kiedis makes you feel like you are his confidante. He's pretty frank with everything, and gives a lot of details about his personal life. He sounds honest, too- almost downplaying some crazy parts of his life. He's not some stuck-up rock star. He's a real person. The pictures document this well, too- you can see who all of these people that Kiedis talks about actually are and what they look like. You can imagine what he looked like when moving to LA as a kid, rather than a midget with really long hair and no shirt. The captions are also funny and quirky. The only problems with the pictures is that there are hardly any that are from the nineties and the twenty-first century (even if it was published in 2004). The pictures are organized into five or six sections in the book, and go basically chronologically, until the last section or two. They are just a bunch of random pictures from all different points of time in Kiedis' life. Another thing is that there is very little about the songs and a bit of the band. This talks a lot about girls and drugs. The Red Hot Chili Peppers seems almost like a job- it's why he travels across the country and world and therefore meets people, but it's just there. I wish more was told about how the songs were created- the inspiration and ideas behind them. Otherwise, it was very entertaining and put-together.
B001DU8T6I|5.0|My dad bought this for me, I may be young but I'm authorized to make this review :).  I'll review song by song.  1) La La Land: It's a catchy song, I really like it, Demi really expresses herself here and in the video too.  2) Get Back: This song appeared in public 1 month before the CD came out, the music video. I like the song, not my favorite but it's a song that cheers you up, there's a lot of optimism in the music video.  3) Trainwreck: Demi wrote this song alone instead of co-writing it, that's why I love it, it's 100% only her work. It's a song about a crazy love.  4) Party: This song is catchy too, it's really good for the first and last days of Summer. It's good for a party :P.  5) On The Line (ft. Jonas Brothers): This could count as a song written by herself, meaning her own part is written by herself. I like the duet, but without de Jonas Brothers it could be better for me.  6) Don't Forget: It's an awesome song, it was about Demi's father who left her and her family and it like touches your heart. In the video I see Demi's tears, and it really touches your heart as well.  7) Gonna Get Caught: Not a lot to say about this one, I think it's also about a crazy love.  8) Two Worlds Collide: In my opinion, the lyrics are about a kid who doesn't deserve to suffer world disasters. Maybe it has another purpose, but that's my opinion.  9) The Middle: She didn't write this song, but it's excellent even though it's not famous (Idk why, it could have been an awesome success as a single), I love when she says ''I like it, I like it, I like it'' XD.  10) Until You're Mine: This is another song she didn't write, but it's nice. I don't have a lot to say as well, I don't listen to this song very much but I was listening to it today, and I also think it's about a crazy love haha.  11) Believe In Me: The last song in the standard edition is a really good song to close the record, it's like about being yourself instead being something you're not.    I have the standard edition, but I listened to the Deluxe edition bonus tracks and I'll review them too:  12) Behind Enemy Lines: I think if I had the deluxe edition, it would be a really great follow to ''Believe In Me'', like the second part of a story. The song is also catchy, it's like a breakout.  13) Lo Que Soy (This Is Me - Spanish Version): It's time for me to say English is not my native language, and I speak Spanish haha :D. It's not the exact translation of the original song, ''Lo Que Soy'' means ''What I Am'' but it's still good. She looks too serious in the music video, though she smiles at the end and it makes me smile too. The song is cute, it's also a good second to close the record, it was a perfect end for the Deluxe edition, because it's like Demi thanking her fans for letting her be ''what she is''.    So yeah, that's the review. I hope it helps someone, even more coming from a kid :D.    P.S: My favorite song out of all is ''Trainwreck'', as I've mentioned, it's just her own song work without any help.
B00448SE4S|5.0|OH WOW. SCOTT PLIGRIM WAS AN AMAZING MOVIE. THE ACTING AND THE ACTION WAS VERY TOP NOTCH. MIKE CERA AND HIS TOTALLY TERRIFIC CO-STARS SEEMED VERY NATURAL IN THE MOVIE.

0439023513|1.0|I could not wait to begin reading the 3rd book in the series, The Mockingjay, so I immediately ordered it from Amazon.  I placed the order on Nov.3 and today is Dec. 5 and I still HAVE NOT RECEIVED my book!!!  I have contacted both the seller (twice) and Amazon, and here I sit without a refund or my book.  I am just wondering what happened in the series...Hmmm...maybe someday I'll get to read the book.  VERY UNHAPPY!!!

044654759X|3.0|Nicholas Sparks is my guilty pleasure.  Each time I put down one of his books I promise myself I'll never read another... most of the time through giant tears.<br /><br />Safe Haven was good, not great, but good.  It was slow moving at first and then somewhere around the middle I found myself unable to put it down.  I really felt for the characters, I ached when they were in pain and soared when they were happy.  Though I am sad to say the ending left me disappointed and unsatisfied.<br /><br />It was a quick read, good for a cold weekend in, but don't expect it to leave a lasting mark on you like some of Spark's other works.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Nothing new can be said about Band of Brothers that hasn't already been said, but you have to watch this in Blu Ray.  The sound and picture quality is second to none.  The battle scenes surround you and make you feel like you are there!  I jumped a dozen times when bombs exploded or shots rang out.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Bought these over the weekend, and so far its the best set of gaming headphones I've used. My previous Razer Megaladon was pretty good but I wanted to break free from the wires. On the 930's the sound quality for games is exceptional especially on Dolby Surround. Playing COD BO, I could hear footsteps behind me and it certainly improved my scores. The bass from the explosions is rich and deep. There was also no problem/cut outs between transmission from the receiver to the cans. Some people will argue that it is better to buy a decent pay of headphones like Sennheiser and matching them with a good soundcard like Asus Xonar or X-Fi Tit HD, as the 930 uses its own processing, but all I can say is listen to your ears- the 930 sound quality, even for music and movies is stunning.  The only con is that the mic needs some tuning, especially when using the morphing effects.   In conclusion, this is the best gaming headset out there at the moment. Buy it.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I just finished watching \\" Predators \\" for the second time on DVD, i watched it the first in the theater several months ago, and i knew i was going to buy the DVD, because this movie is just amazing.  this time, i watched it with my wife who missed watching it when it was in theatres. she enjoyed it as much as i did.  although, this was my second viewing of this movie, it was just as good as i saw it the first time around.  the story is rather basic, but worked just fine for \\" Predators \\", as a group of killers from different parts of the world, find themselves throwm into a jungle, without knowing by whom and for what purpose, only that they are being hunted !!  Adrien brody stars here as our main hero, i must admit, when i first heard he was the lead actor in this movie, i was a bit disapointed, i was hoping for a bigger Arnold type of actor ( think Ven Deisel ), but i was wrong, and Brody proved me wrong, and that a good actor can fit any role, and Brody did a good job with his character in here, he looked tough and was up for facing the predators !  the rest of the actors were also good, Topher Grace was particularly good here.   most characters were intriguing and fun to watch.  action scenes were well excuted, a treat to watch, and seeing the predators coming to life in this movie and going back to what they like doing most, which is hunting people and killing them, was thrilling !!   Sure, this movie isn't perfect, it ain't Oscar material, but it succedeed in being an entertaining and enjoyable movie, which is what movies are all about.  Along side [[ASIN:B002QW7ALM Pandorum]], \\" Predators \\" is one of the best Scifi movie i have seen in years, and is just as good as the first two \\" Predator \\" movies, if not even better !!  highly recommended, worth every penny.
044654759X|5.0|I love any book by Nicholas Sparks ... but this is one of his best ever!    You won't be able to put it down ... and you'll love the ending.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Own the double LP set, absolutely wonderful recording and performance by Krauss and company.  A must have for any fan of Bluegrass/Country vocal music.  Krauss shines as usual.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|Hands down, The Emptiness is the GREATEST CD I have ever listened to. Each song tells a chapter of the ten chapter story (and the epilogue) that comes with the CD. It is about a sketch artist at the turn of the 19th century. It was written very well and is probably the best short story I have ever read. On the CD, the vocals are better than ever, the music is better than ever, and the writing is better than ever. Alesana really put a lot of work into this album, and their true talent shows through in this CD. It is a MUST BUY!
B003R0MF1C|5.0|I have been watching ,this show, for six ( now seven yrs.)  It's been the only one of 2 programs I watch on basic prime time.  I was shocked to hear ,now that they are more forth coming about Allison's true gift,  that my favorite show is being cancelled.  I have purchased all seasons so of course I need the 7th to complete my set. It won't be long and I won't be watching any basic channel programing.
0312263120|4.0|Not being an expert in the field of cryptology, computer science, or even having any knowledge of the NSA, I thought this was an exhilarating book to spend my weekend reading.    Sure, as long as we accept the proposed premises without question, the plot has some credibility. This is one of those fun reads, not one to pore over meticulously. As I read, I noticed some laughable trends in Brown's writing, the most obvious being the general guideline he uses in his novels- often solving the problem at literally the last second, which happens here; involving erudite characters skilled in dealing with arcane subjects. Even then, the story was still captivating and leaves you wondering what's next. Admittedly, the similes were awkward and the characters undeveloped. Yet even after all these perceived detriments, the premise, for me, was a solid one. No degree of technical flaw could dispel my curiosity.      I seem to be one of the few who like this book, not for its accuracy, but rather for the events within the story. I personally am a fan of the short timespan of Brown's books. For me, it makes the story more believable, that so much action would happen in such a brief period. I was a bit fazed by some of the \\"facts\\", but wasn't sure enough of my own knowledge to dispute them in my head. Yes, I cringed when I read the bit about the third graders and the modem for a second time. I managed to overlook that, too.       For the unconditioned mind of the common reader, this should be a fascinating tale of action and suspense. It's a thriller for sure. For those of you who'd rather focus on the inane facts or have a general disliking for unrealistic situations, I doubt you'll find much to enjoy. Let's just say I liked this book in a different way from my love of Angels and Demons, and the DaVinci Code. Honestly, this book is for people looking to enjoy purely a storyline.
B002RSDW80|2.0|If only they had edited out a minute of dialog, this tale of two women from different eras pursuing the same dream would rate 4 or 5 stars.  But the movie's writers decided to pepper the script with swipes at conservatives, thus ruining what would have been a heartwarming story.  For example, when Julie's day job supervisor reproaches her for calling in sick, he admonishes \\"If I were a Republican, you would be fired\\".  And Julia's husband constantly complains about how Senator McCarthy interferes in his work.  Enjoy the story, but filter out the propaganda.
B003O85W3A|5.0|Kings of Leon's \\"Come Around Sundown\\" and Shearwater's \\"The Golden Archipelago\\" were amazing records, but \\"The Suburbs\\" by Arcade Fire was definitely the best record of 2010.  Do not miss this!
B0048LPRD2|5.0|Prodigy's Smack My Bitch Up music video meets Requiem for a Dream meets The Science of Sleep. Awesome cinematography and special effects brings this x-rated experimental feature to new heights. Not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />Blu-ray quality is unimpressive. Film is very grainy and low-quality, which appears to have been done on purpose to give it grit. The graphics are amazing but look all the more fake in high def with the crummy live shots.<br /><br />Consumers may want to save their money and get the DVD instead.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Love all things Twilight and I love this movie. BUT, that doesn't mean I can't admit that all the mountain scenes in the snow look incredibly fake. It's kind of insulting to our intelligence. In terms of the 2-disc version though, the documentary is sorta short for being six parts and the \\"Jump to\\" part is cool, but all in all, it's skimpy compared to the special features on the New Moon DVD. In sum, scant special features are better than none so this is the better option.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|This is not the type of album I was expecting from Josh.  It lacked musicality and sentimentality.  This is so far out from his debut album.  Next time he releases an album, I will be a little more cautious...
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|My wife & I, both Veterans, are avid collectors of Military movies. We both greatly enjoyed 'Band of Brothers' and looked forward to the DVD release of 'The Pacific' with great anticipation. I cannot express how truly disappointed we were with this production. Every element that made Band of Brother such a incredible experience has been removed and replaced with sex & an incoherent story line. My assumption is that this series is to World War II as \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is to the current engagement in the Middle East (Having served 3 tours in Iraq, I found the Hurt Locker offensive & misleading. If any young solider enlists due to the sensationalized 'version' of combat devised for this movie, then the producers have done a great disservice to their country).<br /><br />I will continue to watch Band of Brothers time & time again, sharing this incredible work of Art & History with my children, friends & family. The Pacific is going in the trash, as I could not voluntarily subject anyone to this trash.
0316098337|5.0|Room is one of the most compelling books I have read in a very long time. It is also one of the most difficult to review without revealing too much, the less one knows going in the better.<br /><br />Jack and Ma live in Room, they never leave. Jack is five and this is the only life he knows, he doesn't know there is another world on the other side of Door.  The entire book is told from Jack's perspective. While Jack sees the world from a child's eyes as an adult reading you know that there is something very wrong here and a sense of dread begins to build page by page. It is at times dark and disturbing but it is also full of life and love. It is a book that is hard to stop reading once you start and one you will think of long after.<br /><br />I loved the concept and execution of this book, but what I took from it the most was the depths of a mother's love. Ma does everything to give Jack a `normal' life. They have TV but she doesn't let him watch much, she doesn't want his brain to turn to mush.  She teaches him and invents games and toys out of paper tubes and egg shells; she even creates classes of physical education. Above all Ma loves and wants to protect Jack and that is the impetus of the book that leads to a drastic choice.<br /><br />This will be on my favorite books list for this year, possibly at the top of the list, I was fully immersed in the world of Room and invested in the characters; I was sorry to turn the last page, always the sign of a good read.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Emma Donoghue since I read Slammerkin many years ago, a very different book than this one; also dark and disturbing but in an entirely different way. I do recommend it if you are a fan of historical fiction that is not prettied up.
1416562605|5.0|Loved it.  I have read so few books written recently that have this kind of pacing--it's great to find a book that you can't put down that is also ambitious in speaking about the human condition.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|If you have read the reviews, you will see that there are very positive and very negative. It is the nature of the beast.    I am not going to deconstruct every track. I am just gonna give you my few opinions. As a background, I am in my early 40's, male, a huge fan of Mr. Grobans work and a music junkie.    There is not enough raw emotion on this album. That is probably my biggest complaint. On previous Josh albums, I have had very emotional connections / responses to multiple tracks. This one......not one so far, although Bells is sgtarting to have a weird effect on me.    The album feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. It is the same as P!nks \\"Funhouse\\". Good songs, but the album didn't flow.....everything seemed all over the place. For some artists, this works, but for Josh, P!nk and others, it doesn't.    My biggest complaint, is that Josh sounds bored. There is not the Ummmph that his previous albums have had. I really thought that due to the long break and the new Rubin collaboration, there would be some excitement in his vocals......he sounds bored.    Do I enjoy the album? Yes. Will it be played over and over......no. Maybe certain tracks will grow on me, but I think this one will go on the shelf and Awake will continue to be played until the next one comes out.     Nothing wrong with someone putting out a less than glowing album. It cannot be easy putting one together. Hopefully the next one will have more power, connection and conviction.    We can't all be perfect all the time
030726999X|2.0|I was highly disappointed in the third installment of this trilogy. The first book was a page turner, as was the second half of Book 2. However, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" was a tedious read. In fact, after plodding through the first half of the story I finally abandoned the book all together. The reader is merely a  witness to character revelations of information and plot lines presented in the second book. I do, however, encourage individuals interested in purchasing this book to read other reviews as clearly this book was well liked by the majority of readers.
B002ZG981E|2.0|For a movie as big as this, I was expecting more from BD.    Disappointed, as I found out that:    1) The images quality weren't as sharp as I expected. In fact it appears blurry on a 55\\" flat screen. There were many scenes in the movie where you can tell that the picture quality weren't good enough, such as Auther's striped shirt, the sky view of Mombasa, the skyscrapers in Cobb's limbo world....    2) Special Features were the second disappointment. I was hoping for the commentary, which is all blue-print of a movie, but no. In result, there weren't alot of differents between the BD and DVD features.      It's no wonder why they're selling it for $17.99, only one dollar more than the DVD, because for anyone who'll be watching it on 37\\" or less, one would buy the DVD for cheaper price, if the BD would have charge any higher.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Many reviews from professional review sources cite noise cancellation in the microphone, and so does the box, but a simple search or simply buying this set reveals otherwise.  Search something along the lines of \\"g930 noise cancellation problem\\".     While the audio quality of music etc. is definitely high, that is only 50% of why someone buys a headset.  Without the noise cancellation working, the incredibly sensitive microphone picks up every possible sound in your zip code and leaves your mic open constantly and buzzing.  Lowering the microphone volume drasticly (anything short of muting it) does not affect this at all.  Lowering mic sensitivity in any voice chat program does indeed stop this, but you have to practically yell for it to pick up your voice and will cut out immediately if your screaming falters to a standard humane level of speaking.  This of course is if you are using voice activated speech.  If you use a push to talk key, your mic will of course not remain open, but when you hit your PTT key, friends will hear your voice along with every mouse click, breath, and dogs barking 2 blocks over inside a neighbor's house.    To top off the strangeness, the useless \\"voice morphing\\" feature with the headset software (you know, when you for some reason would like to sound like an unintelligible robot or alien) actually ACTIVATES this previously m.i.a. noise cancellation.  With this headset you have two choices:  Either sound like yourself, albeit screaming to your friends so the mic works, or sound like a staticy orc with excellent noise cancellation.      Here is a link to the thread on the official Logitech forums detailing the problem that has existed for 4 months.    [...]    I would strongly advice not buying this headset until you notice on this thread that the issue has been resolved, because otherwise you're just getting a shiny expensive headset with microphone quality lower than that of a generic brand.
B003VS0CWY|5.0|I love this movie.  I sing along with them.  I really enjoyed being able to see this film in my own home at my own time.  A big plus for me.
B004E9CFZG|5.0|Here's what I think of the Walking Dead series, if you cba to read the whole thing I sum it up in the end :)    If your looking for a zombie series that's strictly all about brain bashing, bloody gore, mindless violence. This is not the show for you. All the bad reviews about the Walking Dead are from people who expect the show to do nothing but bash some zombie brains running around shooting up everything they see in sight.      Truth is the Walking Dead is more about the living aspects to a zombie infected world. As I can recall, there was one episode where only two zombies died. Yes, if you think that's not enough gore for you then you should opt out of watching. But for many others it's so refreshing that there's a zombie based television show that ISN'T all about gore and action. The series explores complex human relationships and mental states of a group of humans who are thrust into vile situations. It truly is fascinating how they are put into various scenarios instead of the standard cut and paste Hollywood zombie film of:    1.Oh no zombie breakout  2.Find a bunch of survivors together  3.Escape to some remote location or find a way to destroy all the zombies and resume life.      The first few episodes do have a lot of character building and will probably bore most people, but when the zombies do come into screen WOW it's on a grand scale, great make up, mass zombie mobs. The series explores assorted situations that I've often wondered \\"what would I do if _____________ happened\\". That I think is why I find this series ground breaking, it focuses a lot on the living instead of the dead.        ******  In conclusion this series thus far is mainly focused on the human relationships and the difficult decisions they have to make. The acting is superb and when a character is going through an emotion (usually sadness lol) you can really feel for them. The standard zombie killing is pretty gory and awesome but you have to be patient for those scenes, as for now the series is in it's infancy and will get much better (I hope lol).
B0041KKYBA|2.0|It's clear from the title that this documentary has an axe to grind.     That being said, the movie is at times fresh, well-paced, and - compared to a Michael Moore film - somewhat mature. I particularly liked some of the technical explanations - such as a clear graphic that is used a few times to explain CDOs, and the explanations of systemic risk in the financial system.    However, the bulk of the documentary consists of softer opinionated explanations. Public figures are accused of guilt by association - Henry Paulson was a former CEO of Goldman Sachs (who knew?), Goldman Sachs was accused of misleading their customers, and so Paulson is a bad treasury secretary; or how could Alan Greenspan be a good chairman after he once consulted for a questionable company for $40,000; or how can academics be fair when they are paid to write white papers by Icelandic banks that later collapsed; or esteemed figures, such as Bernanke and Greenspan, refused to give interviews for the film, and therefore must be guilty (both are known for very rarely granting interviews, and for good reason).    After each of these 'revelations', the film score would treble, and a sarcastic voice continually went off in my head: 'Oh, *that's* why the financial collapse occurred'.     Insofar as blame is laid on sloppy and thick, it focuses largely on private greed rather than public sector follies. Barney Frank is interviewed, yet somehow his irresponsible zeal for combining creative financing and affordable housing is not discussed. Freddie and Fanny are glazed over and treated like just another private company.    The film's largest folly is that it over-simplifies the collapse to simply a matter of greed and deregulation. One principle inherent in financial volatility and collapse is that large events occur because they are unpredictable. Enough people in the world are saying enough things that, no matter what, someone will always say that they saw it coming. The financial system is largely considered self-corrective - isolated bubbles, with limited and short effects, are common. When a crash is large enough that its effects are systemic and long-lasting, then it requires investigation. However, most - but not all - of the explanations given in the film were not unique to the current crisis. Greed, risk, and folly are always present in some manner and degree. The question is what was different this time around.    The devil is more often in the details than in the people, and explanations are rarely so simple as the emotionally satisfying ones espoused in this film. For instance, some failed banks paid CEOs huge salaries, but other failed banks paid their CEOs much less. And finding a fed chairman or treasury secretary who has not previously done work for some private firm would be like finding a qualified surgeon general who was not a doctor. And many companies who paid credit rating agencies for a rating (you sort of have to) received poor ratings as well. And even though credit rating agencies had some pretty huge blunders, they were listened to because of their reputation, which was previously high (and for a good reason) and has now taken a hit (and for a good reason). Moreover, they often take into account public policy, factoring in, for instance, the government's backing of Fannie and Freddie.    In sum, it's nice to a see documentary open this area up for discussion, but it would've been much nicer to see a discussion that was more multi-dimensional, informative, and thought-provoking, rather than one that settles for cheap emotional and populist sentiment.

B004FDY4LE|5.0|This is by far the best made for TV series, the best SiFi Movie event, the best ANYTHING ever seen on the screen.  Wonderfully made, touching and believable characters, life like events that can touch a wide spectrum of viewers.  I was a bit skeptical at first when learning about this series. I mean Zombies? Really, come on now. But after watching  just a trailer of this series my interest was tickled. After watching episode one, I am now hooked and I cant wait for  season two. I just want to say to the writers and the producers of this series, THANK YOU for your brilliant work.     Bravo !!!    Strictly Business
B003YNFYCO|4.0|I take one star away for not including the version of Help with the James Bond intro as the original vinyl records did.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|As it was probably with many of you who listened to the movie critics, I was hesitant about watching this movie. But Prince of Persia: Sands of Time just emphasizes the fact that the movie critic elite have lost touch with the general movie going public and wouldn't recognize a truly fun movie if it bit them in the doo, dah, doo dah...     This movie isn't supposed to be the next Academy Award winner (ergo: a bunch of neurotic people cry about their troubles) which seems to be the only movies that the critics approve of. This movie is about spectacle, great cinematography, great action and a good plot.     It's evident that many of the intelligentsia who reviewed this movie in newspapers and television didn't even see the movie.    Basically, this film is a great adventure movie that anyone with half a brain could enjoy...which basically explains why the movie critics didn't like it. lol.    If you are looking for an entertaining movie set in a great backdrop with good action and a good plot premise, check this one out. I had a great time watching this one.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My 3 kids and I saw this movie in the theater this summer--we fell in love with it. So, I bought it for them for Christmas.
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|I am writing this on behalf of my (upset) wife.  I'm sure the quality of the disc/film itself is good, but I felt that I needed to put this on here for people that might be thinking about purchasing this disc.  It is a single disc with a Blu-Ray on one side and DVD on the other.  It is advertised as having a 6 part documentary on both sides, but this is not the case.  I did a little research and apparently you have to buy the 2 disc special edition to get that.  This is seems to be unfair and very confusing.  We have a PS3, but my wife watches in the bedroom where there is only a DVD player.  Needless to say, it's very frustrating that we now have to buy another copy of the disc.  CHANGE THE ADVERTISING--it makes no mention of which disc does or does not have various features.  Everything looks to be identical on both discs according to the box, and there is no mention of the DVD side not including the documentaries.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Just a short review here because others have been so definitive. I've loved this movie since it was originally released. I saw it when it first came out, when it was re-released, when really bad copies have been shown 40 years later during a summer movie festival and every version to come out on VHS and DVD. The blu-ray copy is extraordinary and you will not be disappointed with it. I thought it was just me who perhaps had not noticed all the things in previous versions that others have commented on. This is an excellent example of what blu-ray should be like.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|A lovely holiday album indeed, I could listen to it over and over. Without a doubt this is one of my favorite holiday albums, right up there with Christmas with a Kick I.
B003XQ9BXU|1.0|This film is utter crap. The writing is so awful that even a great actress like Cate Blanchett sounds silly delivering the lines. Please save yourself the torture of watching this film--unless, that is, you want to sit through a perfect example of stupid, hollywood tripe.
B0042AEOG0|5.0|Love this album, like always mariah never dissapoints! after all this years she still manages to create amazing music!! thank you so much mariah!!!
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|There's no denying that this is well-made product. Understandable when you look at the roster of musicians participating. But honestly, there are already thousands of artists who can put me to sleep. No, worse than that, this CD makes me feel old. And that's not what I'm looking for in music. I want to be invigorated and reminded of why music is essential in our lives. Certainly not what's going on here. (You may have guessed by now that I haven't bought a Clapton CD in a while ;-) Still, great production values and, well, it's (unfortunately) pretty near perfect.
1582701709|5.0|This book could help anyone who wants to better their life with positive thinking and a positive attitude. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|What a wonderful classic, that was beautifully restored. Since this is not \\"Time Compressed\\" to run in the time alloted that you typically see on network and even cable providers you get to see the whole movie.  There were scenes that if I had seen before I had long since forgotten.  That made the movie doubly enjoyable...for the re-discovery.  Watch it with family and you will hear people singing the songs for the next few days.  Enjoy...we did!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|Everything about the Life DVD in Blu Ray is fabulous.  The cinematography is most incredible.  I am glad we went with the version narrated by David Attenborough.  We saw the Oprah version on TV but after reading the reviews we decided to purchase Attenborough narrated DVD and are very glad we did.  I just ordered the Planet Earth Blu Ray DVD and hope we hope it is just as good.
B002VPE1OS|3.0|I was very impressed with the thickness, fit, and quality of the screen protector.  However, the film itself made the text on the screen less sharp.  There was also a cloudiness that could mainly be seen when looking at white backgrounds...it's a bit hard to describe.  This was most likely due to the anti-glare effect.  However, I've used an anti-glare screen that came with the airjacket case and did not have this problem.  If you're a stickler for screen clarity and want an anti-glare screen, I'd recommend going with one of the products from the apple store.
B00064AM6C|5.0|OMG!  $70 dollars for the DVD.  I remember when it first came out and I bought a copy (which I STILL own) from an old Sam Goodie (Remember those?) for $14.95!!  So would I buy it for seventy dollars or more now?  Yes indeed I would.  To explain understand that I am a huge White Stripes fan (if you are buying this for a big WS fan read no more, just buy the damn thing!) and if I like something I get it. Now this being as expensive as it is I would hesitate to buy, however, because I have seen the DVD before and knowing what is on it I would save to buy it.  Under Blackpool Lights is the Ultimate concert experience.  The sound quality of the DVD is amazing, plug that into 5:1, sounds like being there.  Just the flow of the DVD and quality of the music being played, the video creativity of Third Man Inc, it is just an awesome DVD.  I think it came out in 2004 and since my original purchase I have watched it countless times.  My personal favorites would be Death Letter, Ball and Biscuit, Goin' Back to Memphis, De Ballt of de Boll Weevil, which curiously, all but one are covers.   But the best part is the dance at the very end..... along with a closing number from Hank Sr.  Awesome.....
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I have to admit that I was introduced to Nicki Minaj through a pop superstar (Mariah Carey on Up Out Your Face), so my vision of what I wanted Nicki Minaj to put out on an album was directly related to that first experience with her. I am primarily a pop lover and not usually a hip-hop lover. This album was perfect for an introduction to Nicki Minaj for us that normally do not like Hip-hop music because it is very \\"bubblegum pop\\" instead of hardcore rap. I have in the past listen to more \\"hardcore\\" rap artists that stay true to the hip-hop game like Lil'Kim, Trina, and such. This felt like a good introduction to her and hopefully her next album meets the demands of those that wanted a more hip-hop album from this particular artist.    I loved this album based on that it had a nice mix of songs from artist. My particular favorite has to be \\"Save Me\\" with its infectious beat and the lyrics that are begging someone to come and save her. My second favorite song has to be \\"I'm the best\\" because again it is pure pop, but mixed with some elements of the rapping that she is also known for. I feel like if she continues down this way she will lose the hip-hop community, but she will be gaining more mainstream fans.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|People who liked the Percy Jackson books will love this first installment of the new companion series.  It follows three new heroes and is set in the same world as Percy Jackson, a couple of years later.  Riordan makes a switch from the first person view of Percy to a third person rotating POV featuring the three new heroes:  Jason, Piper, and Leo.  I really liked this switch.  It worked great with the new characters and made them feel equally important to the story.  There are also cameos by some favorite PJ characters which I thoroughly enjoyed.  The story in this one was pretty cool, but it is clear by the end that the follow-ups will be pretty epic, and now I can't wait to get my hands on them.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|The consensus on RottenTomatoes.com is \\"A clever, offbeat romantic comedy, 500 Days of Summer is refreshingly honest and utterly charming.\\" and I could not agree more.    This is not your typical love story/chick flick. It is so much smarter than your normal love story movie, and I'm sure most people will be able to connect strongly with the main character Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|Got this for a project  matched it with a Toms hardware recommended motherboard from Asus, and got it rolling, it screams!... the price in itself is really surprising to get this amount of cores in a chip, combined with the flexibility will leave you speechless, matched up with 4 sticks of crucial memory, an ocz vertex 2, its a dream, the price might be in the middle of hte ladder, but the performance its not, i've become fan of AMD procs as i normally look for the best bang for the buck this one its a jewel you will no be dissapointed, while you will defenitely be looking for a new proc in a couple of years as that's they way of the world, you will be pretty good for at least 2 years running games at really good resolution
1400052173|5.0|I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this book. I was looking through my \\"books ordered but not read yet\\" stack and and thought \\"What the heck\\".   I started reading and found I could not put it down. It is like no other book I have read or thought I would read.   Talking to my sister about this story (she thought I was crazy), it was obvious she was bored just to hear me go on how gripping it was.   We share our reading. I will send it on to her but iffy if she will read.  Loved the book.
B003V63VNI|4.0|Brandon Boyd. The mere utter of the name evokes tremendous excitement in me, and most Incubus fans for that matter. For any other person, maybe not so much. One listen to Brandon Boyd's solo debut, however, should have people singing a different tune (literally?).<br /><br />As a frontman, few bands out right now can rival the lyrical prowess, the vocal beauty, or pure know-how, that Brandon Boyd possesses. Listen to Incubus discography and just try to disagree with me. Even if you don't like the music you should be able to appreciate words as well crafted as his. With each new offering from Incubus Brandon has become more and more involved, culminating in his penchant for bringing out a guitar and backing up Mike Einzinger in concert fairly regularly. This is where The Wild Trapeze enters. Every instrument used (aside from the drums, I think) were played by Mr. Boyd himself. This in itself is impressive, but this fact doesn't hinder what he's already so well known for, his voice and lyrics.<br /><br />Throughout the entire duration (as brief as it may be) the ideas behind each song are so well crafted, so expertly presented, that it's hard not to appreciate all of them. I will admit that it will take several listens to fully enjoy the CD in its entirety. Heck, even I, an unabashed Incubus fanatic, had to let it grow on me. Even now, as it certain songs still crop into my head, I find myself yearning to listen to a track I normally looked over previously.<br /><br />The Wild Trapeze is full of memorable tracks like Revenge of The Spectral Tiger, the title track, Here Comes Everyonoe, A Night Without Cars, and All Ears Avow!, but even the songs I don't look at as being true standouts I still really enjoy. The only problem with The Wild Trapeze is that there's not a whole lot of variety. Seeing as how the entire CD is acoustically minded and the fact that Brandon hails from such a diverse band, this feeling was bound to arise. BUT! This is Brandon Boyd, so it is something to behold. If you can find it, definitely pick this up, you won't regret it.an find it, definitely pick this up, you won't regret it.

B003T70B46|4.0|I'm always looking for new music and new artists. I can never quite understand how some people listen to only one genre of music or don't open their ears and minds up to all the different styles out there. When I go to a concert I look for someone who can sing and has stage charisma, when I buy a CD I look for someone who can sing and has memorable music. Truth be told I never heard of Sissor Sisters or Jake Shears up until about one month ago. I find Jake intriguing. Love their funky music and their sound.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|First off I am not nor have I ever been a fan of rap or hip hop, but for some reason I love Kanye West's \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". I first heard \\"Runaway\\" on the Howard Stern show when he played it coming back from a break. After hearing the song I was in agreement with Howard that the song was quite catchy. Then I started hearing all the buzz about this album and how great it was supposed to be, so I picked it up. The hype is right, this IS a great album. The album really should be listened to from start to finish to completely appreciate it, singles don't do it justice. Kanye is joined by LOT'S of guests and he is almost a side player on the tracks. Although some of the tracks are upbeat and have a great thumping beat, there seems to be a feel of dispair over the whole album, that's not a bad thing, but there is a sadness underneath the rhythms. The standout tracks for me are: \\"Dark Fantasy\\", \\"All Of The Lights\\", \\"Monster\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"Lost In The World\\" and \\"Who Will Survive In America\\". Mix in the guests, the samples and the beats and you have a masterpiece.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I must have watched this film over 100 times or so since i was about 9 years old. I never had any interest in the new film(2010) and i still don't. There are way to many remakes around and no originality, and the chemistry between Ralph Macchio and Pat Marita in this film is just staggering. Even the other 2 films they did were very good, the third being the worst. This classic just has all the makings of a classic and well it just is. You really feel for Daniel and his tribulations he goes through in moving from Newark NJ to California(L.A). He gets beat up about every other day, and then finds sanctuary within Pat Marita's kind personality and friendship. This movie is way more than getting revenge and really doesnt ever have much to do with that. It's actually just about the relationship between the two, and how an old person can teach an young person the right way to live without pure violence.    The film also shows the difference in cultures from both sides of the story, to Daniel and Mr Miyogi, to his new found flame played by (Elizabeth Shue) he has to adapt to both worlds. Learning how to fit in out in California i'm sure wouldnt be easy especially for a teen, let alone meeting a man from Okinawa. So this film is something every family should enjoy, and if the new one suits you watch it as well, i'm sure its fine. To me though if there is a remake of a film that was made only 26 years ago, i think thats a little on the desperate for entertainment side, at least wait till its around 40 or so. So this is a great drama for all ages and actually quite funny in a lot of ways. Just watching the two bond on screen is a great experience and it doesnt ever get old to watch again and again. I can also recommend Part 2, as its a worthy sequel, 3 is \\"ok\\" but Daniel is obviously older and he really acts a lot different in that film, almost like he's hopped up on meds making him way to hyper. So get the first and enjoy, then move onto the others as you please.    Something i did want to note about films and plausibility, this one is pretty much that way all the way through, although, if someone was beating you up, or your son, you would pressing a lot of charges. The one thing thats not a big deal but you don't realize is that the cops are \\"never\\" involved, of course i guess that would have defeated the purpose, especially when Mr Miyogi beats up young teenage boys, and would have been thrown in jail! HA. Small potatoes.    Some great quotes from Pat as well. R.I.P Mr.Miyogi.    As Daniel slave paints-Mr.Miyogi \\"Oh miss spot\\"  Of course the infamous, \\"wax on, wax off\\".  Tells Daniel when he says punch him..\\"What are you some kind of girl or sumting\\"  Chops off the top of a beer bottle, Daniel says, how did you do that?...\\"Dunno!, first time\\"  I also like in the second film, Daniel says wow, can you break a log like that, he says \\"dunno never been attacked by tree\\".  Other worthy classic quotes  \\"Sweep the leg\\", \\"Gonna get him a boddyyy baggg yeahhhh!!!\\" and of course \\"FINISH HIM\\"---The Crane!!HA    Great film(s).
B003L20ICE|4.0|To ramp up the drama in this film, the director takes some very predictable and not very believable plot twists.  I would have preferred she stay with the natural drama inherent in the very situation itself of a sperm donor finally meeting the children he sired for two lesbians almost two decades ago.  The oldest child is set to go to college in a few weeks.  Thus the stage is set for everyone to meet Mark Ruffalo as the donor.  Julianne Moore and Annette Bening play the lesbian couple with Bening being a doctor and Moore the homemaker. Ruffalo owns a local restaurant.<br /><br />Where it veers in the wrong direction is an attraction which flares up between the male donor and one of the lesbian women.  Where it veers in the right direction is the inherent drama in finding out the missing link in your family's overall equation.  It is a tension fraught situation for everyone wondering how he will change their family and whether Pandora's Box has been opened or not.<br /><br />The film has a lot to say about nature vs. nurture.  It drives one of the mothers crazy that she starts recognizing the children in his gestures and movements.  The genetic stamp is there.  Yet the donor is a real goof off in comparison to the family unit.  The children have absorbed the advantages of having two highly educated and motivated mothers rearing them. They clearly do not have their father's attitude of \\"wasting his time by going to college.\\"<br /><br />The law has been changing rapidly with its being harder and harder to keep biological parenting information secret.  We are clearly headed in the direction of most children knowing who and where biological parents are in almost every situation. Where this film is very good is in exploring the natural drama of what happens when a family has to start dealing with these issues now that the information is available.  I wish the director had stuck to that natural drama rather than an unlikely attraction between Ruffalo and one of the women but that only takes one star off.  It is very much a four star, very good film.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B003W5C0VW|5.0|This is an excellent Rolling Stones concert. The sound and quality is very good, I think the digital re-master of it makes the difference. But what really made the difference as a whole is the lead guitar performed by Mick Taylor.  I'm not underrating Keith Richards lead guitar today,but let me say this Mick Taylor is beyond no doubt the undisputed best lead guitarist The Rolling Stones ever had. So if anyone wants to see The Rolling Stones at they're best well then this is the DVD to buy.
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I think it was a stroke of genius to set this remake in Beijing! I've recently visited Beijing and it is a stunning city with so much to offer! Showcasing the city added another fresh exciting element to a movie that would have just been predictable and boring if set in the ol US of A. The acting was also great! Jaden and his mum definitely acting amazingly well! What surprised me was Jackie Chan who really brought emotion to the character! Something this amazing legend of the industry doesn't always get the opportunity to do. The other supporting actors were also amazing! Especially Jaden's love interest who was very endearing. This was a movie with very few surprises because everybody knows how the story will play out. I definitely thought that adding all these new elements refreshed the movie and made it 'new.' I'm definitely rushing out to get my bluray copy! Can't wait to see Beijing in hi-def! This is an old school, good family flick that will keep you engaged from start to end. Go get it :)
B003UYUP58|5.0|This book is incredibly worthwhile.  There is so much insight.  I think everyone should read it.  It is worth every penny.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|The Expendables, when I first saw details on it a year or two ago, seemed like a silly idea at the time. How could they fit so much epic-ness in one film? Well, Stallone brnigs us this film and as you would expect, the nerd-gasms are all over the place throughout the movie. For as old as most of the cast are now, they showed off decent stunts and hilarious actions, guys who we grew up watching over the years doing what they do best.     I'm disappointed that Van Damme declined a role in the film. But wow, just look at the cast...when Willis, Stallone, and the Govinator were meeting, I was ready to mark out like a crazy little schoolgirl in the theater, but I managed to control myself, heh. It's a typical action film, nothing entirely special, but eh, the film is more about the nostalgic campy-ness than anything else if you ask me. Statham's one of my favorite action stars today, and he did not let me down. Crews was undoubtedly hilarious, and Li was...well Li.     There was some scenes which I thought they could have cut, few side-stories here and there, but overall, I didn't care, I just watched some of my favorite action stars of yesterday, today, and tomorrow, do their thing. These kinds of films are the simple 'sit back and enjoy' ones, so it's quite difficult to really give it a review. It's just a like it or not kind of flick, and for me, I enjoyed it. Entirely biased, I know, but what can I do? If I judge this film like the norm I'll end up nit-picking and bashing, when I know what this movie's goal was.
1440503257|3.0|This is a great idea, but doesn't quite meet expectations.  For example, there are some obvious foods in the Harry Potter books, like butter beer, that aren't even in the cookbook. Many of the recipes that are in the book _aren't_ in the Harry Potter books at all, but just representative of English fare that might very well have been served at Hogwarts or by Aunt Petunia. I bought the book for my daughter who is a Harry Potter fanatic and loves to cook, but I doubt that it will be used very much.
B001TODCII|4.0|Liam Neeson impresses all in Taken. When he took part in this film, he was around 55-56 years of age, and to see someone as old as him in good, fit condition to perform some of the stunts...it's quite an amazing feat. He plays a retired CIA agent, trying to reconnect with his daughter that the stressful job has kept him away from for many years. If there's one thing Bryan Mills (Neeson) hasn't missed, however, is his daughter Kim's (Maggie Grace) birthday. Every year, no matter what, he'd be there, he'd buy her a gift. Mills had split with his wife, who had re-married into a rich family, and Kim's been under their custody. Following her 17th birthday party, Kim wanted to go see a band tour in Europe, and reluctantly, Bryan agrees.     This is where things get interesting. It reminds me of the game, Heavy Rain's tagline, \\"How far would you go for the ones you love?\\" During the trip, Kim and her friend Amanda get kidnapped by a crime organization specializing in drugs and extortion of female teenagers. Luckily for Kim, she was on the phone with her father at the time of the kidnapping, and managed to give him a few key details on the situation, clues in which he uses to find her. The action gets intense as the film goes on, with car chases, hand-to-hand combat, and shoot-outs, in typical action format. What makes this film stand out more than the generic action 'X' films, though, is the goals and acting performances. The plot helps back up Neeson's edge to find the daughter, showing that he'd do whatever it took to get her back, including shooting a former friend's wife...pretty crazy, but you can't help but side with Neeson's character, I'm sure any parent who has even but an ounce of care for their children would do the same if in that particular situation.     I know action films include Supermen, and Neeson plays a Superman here, but the badassness of it all overshadows the impossible bits, heh. I really liked the plot of this movie. It shows possibilities, in today's world, I wouldn't be surprised if extortion of this caliber has occurred. But really, Neeson's perfomance is phenomonal, and this film has even appealed to non-action fans that I've shown it too. Highly recommend it. I'd give it a perfect score but I was slightly disappointed by the lack of human flaw in the movie. Still, superb action-packed, suspense-thriller.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|Like many people, I have fond nostalgic memories of the original. However, I feel this movie is just as good and excellent family entertainment that both kids and adults will love.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of cliches or being emotionally manipulated and this movie's interpretation of Mr. Han's loss of his wife was very powerful. Jackie Chan and Lil' Smith kid did a great job acting for a tough scene. Sure the end of the scene was a bot cliche, but everything leading up to it made it ok.<br /><br />They referenced and nodded to the original through sight gags and came up with new ways to retell this story creatively and made it very exciting. Since they took some risks, you really doubted which way the move was going - even at the end.<br /><br />Sadly, many of the negative reviews are calling out one of two things: 1) The \\"karate\\" kid is now black and 2) He learned Kung Fu, not Karate. I thought it was all about the story?<br /><br />To the first point, both the original and the new version have nothing to do with race - even though both are about different cultures finding commonality in each other (Pat Morita was Japanese, people). In fact, in many spots where a less mature director would take advantage of a black kid from Detroit to bring \\"street smarts\\" to China,  the high road is taken as are some of the opportunities for Chinese stereotypes. This movie was made with great respect of Chinese culture and not over representing an \\"American\\" attitude as a fish out of water.<br /><br />To the second point, I doubt most negative reviews would know that it was Kung Fu if the movie hadn't said so. Karate is a Japanese art, not Chinese, so it makes sense that he didn't learn Karate in China. However, I do have to agree that they called it the \\"Karate Kid\\" just for advertising purposes. I think people would have been ok with calling it the \\"Kung Fu Kid\\" with a nod as a Karate Kid remake. Why didn't the movie take place in Japan and call it Karate? Not sure.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for family and it works just as easily for adults. It's not as kiddie as people make it out to be and the maturity of the kids as both actors and characters far exceeds that of the original movie. I know we all have nostalgia for Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita (R.I.P!), but this movie is about as good a remake as the original and doesn't skimp on the same emotional roller coaster ride and life lessons.it works just as easily for adults.

B003ELOQCU|5.0|This is a very nice Boxset and I am very happy to have it. :) U2 are always great to watch and I have seen them live quite a few times, most of their DVD's catch the feeling and this one does as well. The best for me is still \\"U2 go home - Live at Slane Castle\\" as it catches the ultimate U2 concert feeling (plus I have been at this concert).    This is a must for every U2 fan out there.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I use this headset on the PS3 and when I play Starcraft 2 on the PC. Works great! Others can hear me very clear and being able to lower chat or game sound on the toggle helps. The cord is long so I'm able to kick back on my bed when i play Black Ops late at night. When I don't feel like talking, I just move the mic out of way and put the chat down so I don't have to mute people all the time. Highly recommended.
B0035G9ABG|3.0|This is a Solid Album has some nice hooks but it is not as good as the previous releases. No Song really catches on to me like Dare or Dirty Harry did from the previous Albums.
B003L20ICE|5.0|In a world where nearly every story line and plot point feels like an obvious clich&eacute;, it's nice to find a film that relishes inside those clich&eacute;s with such rich character development they transcend, becoming real and raw and honest and even, despite their apparent familiarity, fresh and exciting.<br /><br />Yes, `The Kids Are All Right' may appear on the outset to be a gigantic lump of clich&eacute;d material, masked over by the `modern twist' of a `modern family', but the heart of this film beats so naturally and so authentically you instantly forgive and even forget that you've, in a way, seen it all before.<br /><br />This is `that' good.<br /><br />The film considers the marital relationship between alpha-lesbian, Nic, and her supportive and somewhat neglected wife Jules.  Their relationship, while grounded in obvious love, is tested when their two children seek out their donor father when the eldest turns eighteen.  Joni and Laser (the children) are your typical teenage kids growing up in an anti-typical household.  They have their insecurities and longings and a deep need for some closure with regards to their `father'.  So, without parental consent, they seek out Paul; their fun loving, bed hopping father.  Paul, still very much a kid himself, approaches the situation with an obvious naivety, which is instantly appealing to his daughter Joni and her mother Jules.  Laser, and to a deeper extent Nic, are apprehensive, even distant; feeling that Paul is going to ruin their family dynamic.<br /><br />When tensions begin to mount, that premonition proves true.<br /><br />The film, as a whole, is about personal growth.  Every character has their personal epiphanies based on their newfound `family'.  Paul, the fifty-year-old bachelor, is beginning to doubt his life goals as he really connects to his paternal side.  Jules, seeing the carefree nature of Paul (something they share), begins to question her relationship with Nic, who has become even more overbearing and critical with Paul's presence.  Laser, who obviously longed for a father figure, begins to shape his identity as he observes who this man is and who he wants to emulate.<br /><br />Like I said; personal growth.<br /><br />The performances here are a figurative goldmine.  I mean, I can't really see Bening losing the Oscar at this point (even if she isn't my personal favorite in the film, she has OSCAR written all over this performance).  Everyone is so effortlessly natural and believable; even the children (played wonderfully by Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasokowska).  For me, the film is all about the charismatic beauty that resides between Mark Ruffalo and Julianne Moore.  Together they make this film for me.  Ruffalo is an actor I have always really liked, and this is easily his grand opus.  Saying that sounds so odd, since this is such an internalized and quiet performance, one that is so natural and effortless that it could easily be passed over, beings that it isn't flashy.  That would be so sad, because Ruffalo creates such a genuine and real man in Paul.  My mind still recalls that initial phone call with his daughter; the way he stumbles through every word and his reaction to her nonchalance is just NOT fakable.  He really understood this character.  Moore layers all of Jules's complexities with such beauty and restraint.  Nothing is overworked and oversold.  You really see her for who she is, no gimmicks.  In fact, every single scene is played (by every actor) with such honesty, for face value.  The big surprise was Wasikowska (who, with any justice, will snag a surprise Supporting Actress Oscar nomination), who just finds such collective grace in her portrayal of the conflicted teen.<br /><br />That final scene, the quivering chin...just WOW.<br /><br />In the end I will just say that I am still quite smitten with this beautiful little film that understands its own direction and presents something intimate and sincere, finding the realistic tensions in life whilst remembering the beauty of the human smile; which is something I did a lot of while watching this movie.did a lot of while watching this movie.
0441018866|5.0|Not much of a review, but wanted to give it my thumbs up.  Really interesting new ideas. Good actions.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|I can only echo what others have said in terms of the radical changes from the book to the movie.  With that being said, the movie itself wasn't a total loss.  Sure, I was disappointed that it was so very different from the book, including the fact that they changed the character who is the Lightning Thief.  However, I think that two of the main characters are portrayed by very charismatic actors (Percy and Grover.)  The movie Percy is different from the book Percy in that he's much more likable.  He seems to have a gentler, less sarcastic side to him in the movie and doesn't seem to be out to antagonize anyone, well, other than Gabe, and even so, he's much less antagonistic.  Grover is hilarious.  I didn't picture him that way at all while reading the book, but I see that it fits well.  Annabeth was the disappointment for me.  There was nothing at all about her backstory, whereas in the book, it helped to lend depth to her.  The actress couldn't inject enough personality into the role and came up short, relying on piercing stares and fierceness to establish herself.  There is a lot of sexual tension in the movie.  Much more than was in the book.  Grover's consumed by it.<br /><br />I think that there is enough in the movie to carry it, especially if you haven't read the book and there's nothing to compare it to.  It was scary, quite scary in some parts.  I'm not a fan of surprises and ended up jumping a few times.  The story is an adventure and smoothly transitions itself through to the end, which was surprising for me as it was so different from the book.  Overall, it was okay, just not as outstanding as I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />Yes, there are major differences from the book, but not enough to say that it's a complete and total departure.  I was really hoping that Percy's home situation would have resolved itself as it did in the book, but, alas, it wasn't to be in the film.  ((sigh))

0307454541|1.0|I have never written a review before, but this book is so offensively boring that I just have to write one. This title's plot was OK, but many times what could have been a short trip from A to B ended up becoming one full of mundane, not to mention useless, pitstops from A to Z. There was a paragraph that described her laptop in so much detail it felt like a Best Buy ad. Did I really need to know its brand, model, CPU, hard drive, RAM, and all other specs? Consider these excerpts:<br /><br />1) \\"The rucksack contained her white Apple iBook 600 with a 25-gig hard drive and 420 megs of RAM, manufactured in January 2002 and equipped with a 14-inch screen. At the time she bought it, it was Apple's state-of-the-art laptop... computer equipment was the only extravagant entry on her list of expenses.\\"<br /><br />2) \\"Unsurprisingly she set her sights on the best available alternative: the new Apple PowerBook G4/1.0 GHz in an aluminum case with a PowerPC 7451 processor with an AltiVec Velocity Engine, 960 MB RAM and a 60 GB hard drive. It had BlueTooth and built-in CD and DVD burners.<br /><br />Best of all, it had the first 17-inch screen in the laptop world with NVIDIA graphics and a resolution of 1440 x 900 pixels, which shook the PC advocates and outranked everything else on the market.<br />In terms of hardware, it was the Rolls-Royce of portable computers, but what really triggered Salander's need to have it was the simple feature that the keyboard was equipped with backlighting, so that she could see the letters even if it was pitch dark. So simple. Why had no-one thought of that before?<br /><br />It was love at first sight.\\"<br /><br />Jeebus Christ I get it already her computer is super awesome! Seriously, I think this could all have been summarized simply into \\"state-of-the-art laptop.\\" Steve Jobs loves this book though, I'm sure.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|In short: this is just like what the books are.... pure entertainment. I loved reading the books and I love to watch the movies! My only real disappointment was the decision not to recast Rachelle Lefevre in the role of Victoria. To be honest I have a negative impression of the producers, etc who made this choice. As a viewer we came to expect a presence from Victoria and that presence was originated and in my opinion, perfected by Rachelle Lefevre - Bryce Dallas Howard just didn't meet my expectations in this role. Shame to the movie executives for this decision!
0525423273|5.0|I don't read a lot of contemporary fictions.  And I read even less contemporary young adult fiction.  I think because this is a common type of book and I just don't know how to pick the good from the ok and from the bad.  I hate to say it wasn't really even on my radar until I saw a few glowing reviews for it.  I thought I would give it a try and see what all the fuss was about it.  I think it made me realize that I need to be more open to anything.  I might not like it, but by not giving it a shot, I might miss out on something fantastic.<br /><br />I was pulled in from the first page.  I liked Anna.  She's smart, acts like a normal teenager, and has a typical (sort of) family.  It's something everybody will identify with. I also liked her quirks.  She's overly neat, seems to be afraid of new situations/people which makes her set in her routines.  But, I loved that she was able to step of her comfort zones and really start to explore Paris.  As a character, she one of the best I've seen.  I really understood every action she made.  She just jumped off the pages.<br /><br /> &Eacute;tienne was just as fantastic.  He wasn't perfect and even Anna acknowledges that.  He's fun and has a quirky sense of humor.  Some of his antics had me laughing out loud.  I also enjoyed that added drama of his relationship with his father.  I think what was added was a perfect amount and too much more might have brought the story down.  I also really liked their group of friends.  They entire group struck my as real and would be people I would like to hang out with.<br /><br />I really liked that Anna and &Eacute;tienne's relationship isn't the instant over the top and madly in love that seems very common in young adult these days.  It makes everything concerning how the feel about each other genuine.  They're friends first and foremost.  They learn about each other, their families, and everything else that goes into making a real and lasting relationship.  It reminded me of falling love for the first time.  It isn't always easy.<br /><br />As you can tell, I really loved this book.  It made me giddy and wanting more.

B00005Q66T|5.0|I must start off this review by admitting that I was a child when she first became a household name in the 80's, and was too young to have appreciated her musical greatness. Then the 90's came (along with my teenage years, and I started to get into her songs more). Fortunately for me,(and other fans who have appreciated her since the 80's or 90's) this music collection contains many of the great songs from the 90's and early millenium that fans have come to love. Even if you are a casual fan, I would still recommend this collection because there is something for everyone. Some of the hits that are included in this collection are \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\", \\"Music\\", \\"Human Nature,\\" and my personal favorite \\"Erotica\\". One of the reasons why I like \\"Erotica\\" is because she showed through that song that it is fine to be a sensual, sexual, and self-confident person all at the same time. Obviously, there are other good songs on there besides the ones that I just mentioned, but it was important to me to at least offer a sampling of the great and diverse selection of songs. Many hardcore fans and even occasional and/or casual fans are going to find some songs to love in this collection.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|I'm a Clapton fan from the 60's & 70's. Back then, EC was God. Sadly we've had not much good from Mr Clapton for a long time. All quite listenable and if this had been made by the guy next door, you'd have said \\"Good job sonny, I'll buy a copy if you keep your dog from dumping on my lawn\\". But when it comes from a Guitar God, you say \\"where's the guitar?\\". It's OK, there's even an odd spot of really nice guitar, but there's no 60's/70's EC in here. Listenable it is, EC of old it ain't. If you need something to listen to while you're heading off to the land of nod, then grab it. If you want something to go \\"wow\\" about, just re-listen to his old stuff. EC does rocky blues the best. Think Cream 2005 reunion, brilliant. Even a bit of reggae, I shot the Sherrif, Crossroads 2004. EC has still got it live, but he just doesn't seem to be able to take it to the studio. Maybe he needs the likes of the drug and alcohol fuelled muso's of the 60's/70's stirring the pot. I don't know, but the studio hasn't been EC's friend since the late 70's. Eric buddy, you're not going to be around forever. If you want to make the most of your last years, now is the time.

But, she finds friends that are willing to take her under their wings, and she meets St. Clair--an American guy with a French name and gorgeous English accent, and she falls hard. But, he's taken...and things get complicated. And suddenly, Paris doesn't seem so dull after all.     Anna and the French Kiss is a positively charming, lovely, and romantic novel! Anna's voice, her Parisian boarding school, and her trepidation at exploring a foreign city are all so convincing; it's simply impossible not to fall in love with her and her story. Perkins gives such detailed and precise descriptions of Paris, it's easy to picture yourself there with Anna and her friends walking down a narrow street, or ducking into a small movie theater. At its heart, it is a love story, but Perkins includes so much more than the heart-melting kissing scenes and romantic tension that the flirty cover would suggest. She shows that love is messy and complicated through both St. Clair's and Anna's parents' failed marriages, and in their own struggles to be honest with each other. It's a book about love and lust, and knowing when it's right to let someone go, and when it's worth it to keep fighting. And, it's a book about learning how to deal, and how hard it can be when people you love change. Perkins doesn't over-do a single bit--Anna and the French Kiss is everything you could want in a romance novel, and it will stick with you for a long time--you won't regret picking it up.
B002JVWQT6|4.0|Great price. Could not resist buying my own Christmas present for the kids to give me since we all love to sit down and watch this show. Even my 3 year old quotes lines from season one. 9 and 11 year old discuss episodes with friends. So funny! Will watch over and over again.
0765348780|5.0|I started Gardens of the Moon off a recommendation from some friends a few years back, and ordered (I believe) the first three books all at once.  I decided to jump in whole hog and get into this world that everyone else had gotten into.<br /><br />Well, I started reading Gardens of the Moon, and ... sheesh.  I thought I'd thrown that money down the drain.  I had a hell of a time getting into it, but pressed on.  This is a dense, dense novel, with dozens of characters, a confusing plot, terms I didn't understand, and a shaky sense that *something* is going on, if only I could figure out *what*.<br /><br />In short, starting Gardens of the Moon is a bit like being thrown into the deep end when you barely know how to swim.<br /><br />Erikson's not an author who takes it easy on the reader.  There are very few expository sections or \\"info-dumping\\" conversations between characters where they discuss stuff they already know very well in order to convey information to you, the reader.  No; he throws you into the Malazan world head-first, and expects you to tread water and figure out what's going on.  (For example, I don't think he explains what a \\"warren\\" is until maybe the sixth or seventh book out of 10, by which time the reader probably has figured out a lot on their own.)  There aren't too many throwaway lines or passages, either; incidental stuff can (and does) become important later on.  It's not a book you can skim... Well, you *can*, but you'll probably hate every minute.  Erikson said in an interview that he writes novels as if they were short stories, and IMO, they almost need to be read with that same sensibility.<br /><br />Anyway!  I made it through that first read, and even mostly enjoyed it.  I even thought I was starting to figure it out, too.  By the time I finished reading Deadhouse Gates, I was hooked.  Back then, right after the first read, I probably would have given Gardens of the Moon three or so stars.  It had some really interesting ideas (such as a neat take on, \\"what would someone who'd lived three hundred thousand years think like?\\") but that was about it.  It was funny in parts, grim and others, but generally felt rather arbitrary and random.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving this book five stars *now* is largely what I consider the most amazing part of the series.  It's intensely, astonishingly richer on a second, third, or - heck! - fourth read, after digesting later installments.  On each re-read, it gives you some new perspectives...  It's almost like a new book again.  That apparent arbitrariness and randomness?  Well, it all makes logical sense, too, after you get a few books into the series, to the point where you can say, \\"Well, yeah, I could have seen THAT coming.\\"  I can't say that about too many other books I've read.<br /><br />The Malazan series has its critics, and I can't really say they're *wrong.*  It takes a certain sort of person to enjoy these, and Erikson does have his faults as an author.  But, for my money, this series is about as good as epic fantasy gets.  It's high fantasy pulled down to earth.eone who'd lived three hundred thousand years think like?\\") but that was about it.

B0016BPWNM|3.0|The special effects and the sound track are pretty legit.  The story is pretty lame as an adult, but it kept me interested as a kid.  One thing that haunted me from the childhood viewings was David Bowie's junk.  He wears tight pants throughout the movie and his frank and beans are more visible than I liked.  It was somewhat disturbing.  I also remembered the bog of eternal stench and several other things from the movie.  It didn't really hold up past the nostalgia factor.  Overall, if you're interested in Bowie's bits, then you should check this out.  If you want a good Henson fantasy, go with the Dark Crystal.
B00432QAKK|2.0|While a complete series collection is always a good thing, the most important thing to keep in mind is that it still has the flaws of the previous releases.  The theme is still missing and replaced by generic music, the episodes are still cut and are syndicated versions, and price is a few dollars more than buying the seasons separately.  That will probably fall over time.    A good deal if you're a fan, but nothing has been fixed.  All the discs are still the same from their original releases.  No theme, cut episodes, et cetera.
B004259BMM|5.0|Amazing is the first thing that comes to my mind about this CD. The deluxe version from Target is a must have!   You'll find yourself bouncing around while driving or maybe crying a bit here and there! It makes you believe in the power of love!  I love Keith's music, but the songs on this CD make me remember happy times of being in love. It may sound weird, but I relate some of these songs to my 13 year old daughter. We are both Keith Crazy Monkeys! We listen to this CD non stop! The best songs in my opinion have to be \\"Long Hot Summer\\" \\"Without You\\" and \\"Luxury of Knowing\\". I'm telling you people, the emotions run high on this album so go get it! It will not disappoint!
B002ZG98LO|4.0|I found the movie to be very good and thought it did a great job of balancing what the audience knew and expected with a few new elements.  As you watch Predators many references to the original will pop up and make you smile.  I considered that to be a positive and enjoyed the nod to the original movie.  I was motivated to go back and watch the first one again after finishing Predators.  If you like the predator mythology and typical action movies then you won't be disappointed.    The blu ray extras were also enjoyable.  The motion comics were brief, but gave an interesting glimpse to the characters that are thrown into the plot.  The Evolution of the Species pieces also provided more insight into the direction and depths that were taken to make the movie and mythos as interesting as possible.  The deleted scenes were sparse, but a few of them were great and Trejo fans would have really enjoyed seeing a few of his great lines make it into the final film.  Parts of the extras, especially the commentary, are a bit repetitive as Antal and Rodriguez take turns telling how awesome the other one is.  Overall, a high quality blu ray experience, great value with all the extras, and an excellent step forward for the predator franchise.
1597801585|1.0|The cover says the book is written like William Gibson's style which is a complete lie. I have read books in my life that I thought were boring including The 1000 page behemoth \\"The Stand\\" but I just cannot pick up this book any longer. Nothing happens in the story, there is no plot until about halfway through and still you are wondering why you should even care? It takes over 150 pages for you just to figure out the point of the main character. There is no character development and they are all one-dimensional. Good stories have conflict and resolution this one just has a weird bunch of happenings, except nothing really happens.
B002XUL6QC|5.0|This was an awesome movie that my parents had the honor of being cast in minor roles. I loved the costumes and the color was vibrant.[[ASIN:B002XUL6QC Lola Montes (The Criterion Collection)]]
0465043577|4.0|Very interesting book, combining theories of mathematics, economics and financial markets. Benoit Mandelbrot is a rare mathematician/economist/philosopher in that he can break down complex ideas into manageable facets of increasing detail, all while injecting a sense of humor and humility that I find rare in most theoretical finance books.     I was drawn to Benoit after reading Nassim Taleb's \\"Fooled by Randomness\\" and \\"The Black Swan\\". Anyone interested in progressive concepts of financial theory will enjoy this book.
B002ZG9940|4.0|I usually don't write reviews but I feel like I need to for The American. It seems that a lot of people expected this to be another Bourne Identity or Bond movie. This is definitely not that. This movie is all about the plot and creating tension. It's about the slow and methodical way the plot unfolds. Because of that, when the action comes it feels more real than anything you'd see in a Bond movie.<br /><br />I really, really enjoyed it and if you enjoyed Clooney's version of Solaris over the Ocean movies I imagine you will enjoy this too.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I'll admit, this isn't my favorite Pantera album.  But did they ever release a bad album or even a just-okay album?  I don't think so.
0061766089|2.0|I read this book as part of our User Experience Book Club, and to sum it up in advance, I was quite disappointed. I thought a person like Tim Brown who led a design company of the caliber of IDEO would be able to share some real gems of wisdom with his readers. However, I distinctly felt that Tim didn't know how to do this. Instead, he created lots of different headlines that always made a promise but then didn't deliver. His biggest mistake is that he seems to believe that a long list of case studies with hardly any detail would teach readers how to tackle big design challenges. Unfortunately that is not the case - after reading the book, I knew just as much about how I could change the design culture within my company as before.    If this book was titled \\"All the cool stuff IDEO has done over the past 30 years\\", I would tend to give it 3 stars - I would still think that it's just a never-ending list of involvements, none of them explained in any depth that might prove to be helpful for readers.     In the last third of the book, before he wraps up, Tim then starts to go on for quite a few pages about how designers will be able to save the world, and how pretty much every successful businessman in the developing world who has an altruistic mind-set is in fact a designer who just proves his hypothesis. I find this quite a weak argument, and it gets worse the more Tim celebrates his own profession.    The only saving grace of this book is the very last chapter where he quickly wraps up what a company should do to ramp up its design efforts. Had he used THAT chapter and elaborated it in book form, I would have given him 4 stars and not just 2.

0375842209|5.0|Captivating characters in a wonderfully told story.  Like another reviewer, this book didn't capture me until a little bit into the story, but then it wouldn't let me go.  I didn't want to put it down.  One of the best books I've read this year!
1439107955|5.0|Having watched a Charlie Rose interview with Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee in November, I immediately purchased \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\". I am enjoying reading this fascinating tour de force, and recommend it to any cancer patients or others who want to read more than just cold hard facts about cancer. As a former cancer patient myself, I was impressed by the compassion for patients that is evident throughout Dr. Mukherjee's most readable book.    In particular, there are several references in this book to the gradual development of treatments for leukemia over the past century, and to the excitement during the past decade concerning CML and the wonder drug Gleevec. Evidently, most CML patients who have been treated with Gleevec have achieved remissions that appear to be enduring.    I was diagnosed with CML in 1985 (the pre-Gleevec era); my diagnosis was first confirmed in Canada and then in the USA, and at age 46 I was told that I would probably not survive to age 50. I enrolled in an Interferon clinical trial at M.D. Anderson Hospital in Houston, and became an outpatient of Dr. Moshe Talpaz (who Dr. Mukherjee refers to several times). The treatment was a daily self-injection of alpha IFN for 5 years (1985 - 1990), and I have received no other treatment for CML since 1990 - some 20 years ago. I was declared \\"cured\\" in the mid 1990s, but since then I have occasionally supplied blood samples to Dr.Talpaz, and also to Dr. Andreas Hochhaus in Germany - just to be sure!    A final note: Because there was no mention of Interferon in his book, three days ago I sent an email to Dr. Mukherjee recounting my escape from CML. He promptly replied \\"I'll make it a point to mention Interferon in my next talk about Gleevec\\", while pointing out that the CML cure rate with Interferon is quite low and the drug is often poorly tolerated. That I'm alive and well today is a salutary reminder that those often depressing cancer statistics apply to groups rather than to any one individual.The prompt and friendly email I received from Dr. Mukherjee motivated me to write this short review of his comprehensive history of cancer.

0061801313|5.0|This is a great set of books. I read the whole series in a week. Got this as a gift for my sister!
B002ZG98CS|5.0|Anyone who expected anything more out of this film than big dumb fun is taking this movie, and really, themselves, WAAAAY too seriously. This film, with tongue placed FIRMLY in cheek, is fantastic, fun, and insanely idiotic, much like the '70's grindhouse movies Tarantino and Rodriguez often pay homage to. The only people, in my opinion, who find this movie worth a one-star rating are the cynical, self-loathing film-dorks who sit through movies for the sole purpose of gathering excuses to complain about it. Shut up, sit down, and have a laugh for crap's sake.    Also, I think it's hilarious that under the \\"Tag Suggestions\\" on this screen, there's an 'click to add' option for \\"Steven Segal is fat.\\"
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I had seen reviews and trailers for this for so long but just didn't feel like seeing it. I then was in the local PC store and saw a $9 copy of it. I thought, \\"I guess I can spare the $$ for it.\\". This is the feeling I had about the film before watching it, while watching it and after watching it. Just..sort of, mediocre.<br />While watching this, you have to keep in mind, it is all over-the-top or exagerated.<br />Acting:<br />The characters are original, and it seemed the actors really put some effort into making it worth the $$. Have you ever seen a movie where you thought, \\"These actors just don't care.\\"? (Aragon) This was not the case here.<br />Story:<br />Small spoiler: The basic story is that the main character's father was killed and they hint that he may have been a traitor (or the traitor killed him) and the son is brought into the assassin guild to get revenge. As the son is learning to be the assassin his father was (WOW in a short 6 weeks?), he is given all the tools and chances to find the evidence he needs. The father deserted the family when the son was only 1 week old. When he finds the traitor, the reasons for his actions just seemed like a \\"we've seen this all before\\" feeling.<br />Not the most original story plot but you get the point.<br />Effects:<br />This is where I just felt that we are spit in the face and then the makers said, \\"Thanks for your $$\\". Many of the driving scenes and especially the train scene were so exagerated and unrealistic that I felt insulted. Everyone knows the smallest accident can make a car undrivable. These cars are shot up, flipped and wrecked and the people still drive them away like nothing happened. Where were the cops in all these chases and shootouts? There was only one scene were cops were involved and they just stood around while a car flipped over their blockade and then drove away??!!<br />Spoiler: The main character says in the movie how he is against just killing someone because he is told to (it's fate) and he has a respect for human life but..The train scene showed us the main character had no care for all the innocent people killed in the train crash due to his actions. Also, if an assassin is right next to you and has the chance to kill you, they would NOT shoot the glass out around you. They would just shoot you dead right there.<br />The bullet bending: Although this is possible to do, and was a cool effect, it is done to the extreme so far that it is just impossible and unbelievable. A bullet is fired and curves in a perfect circle back to the originator? Bullets with words inscribed in them such as \\"Goodbye\\" and pretty swirls carved into them? Come on! The tragectory would be thrown off.<br />As stated, the characters are interesting and the acting is not bad at all but the insulting effects that are just so impossible made me give it 3 stars. I will never complain about seeing Angelina Jolie in a healing bath and the sex appeal she brings to most movies is always welcome but it's not enough to raise the rating.<br />Game spinoff: If you didn't know, the game they made based off this movie was just as mediocre if not worse.life but..The train scene showed us the main character had no care for all the innocent people killed in the train crash due to his actions.

B002JVWQSW|5.0|The rumor of the death of the sitcom is greatly exaggerated...especially when it comes to this show.  There is no need to find itself or its audience.  There is no need for it to go through one season to get funny.  This one hits the ground running.  An excellent cast along with clever writing makes this one a winner!  The adults are great and the kids are amazing.  The balance between humor and pathos is perfect.  Some might find the docucomedy style passe; but in this instance it works better than in The Office.  If you haven't seen you are missing out on some great entertainment.  The included extras are fun too (interesting tidbits about the actors, writers, and producers, along with bloopers)...
0312600844|1.0|A tedious trek through the hollow lives of several generations of the Berglund family.  And not a sympathetic character in the bunch.  Not one that I would root for or shed a tear over.  If the author's intent was to convey a sense of ennui and emptiness of this age and culture, he succeeded.  I was ennui-ed throughout the book.
B0036EH3UC|2.0|Well I waded through all 6 seasons (2.5 + 4.5 make six), and if they cut out all the sex you would have to remove an entire season.    The show is composed of episodes that move the plot forward and are very good, and episodes that I call \\"soap opera\\" episodes that go and don't contribute anything.  If you also took out all of the soap opera episodes, you would have only have one season left.    The exodus from New Caprica (season 2.5 I think) was fantastic...probably the best episode of the series.    The end of the last season (4.5) was a huge disappointment.  Some of the questions they left unanswered which is fine, but the questions they did answer, which they had been building towards the entire show, where such a huge disappointment, one being the opera house and the dream of Rosalyn, Caprica 6 and Athena.  The other was Starbuck, somehow she was the Harbinger of Death, and the end-result of the song she heard/felt as a child was disappointing.    It seemed the entire point of the show was to make it as morally grey as possible.  All of the characters were extremely inconsistent.  For instance the President has a citizen tortured, and then afterwards says to the effect \\"of course we're going to give him a fair trial.\\"  It was then I realized that this show was written during G.W. Bush's first term in office and the president apparently mirrors him and Admiral Adama mirrors Rumsfeld who answers valid press questions with \\"I don't answer hypotheticals.\\"  The exception is that the show tries unsuccessfully to make them seem like good people at heart instead of the evil conspirators bent on implementing a New World Order.  The show takes good characters and has them make incredibly bad decisions and bad people and try to make them seem good, the characters are extremely inconsistent.  An oft heard line in the first couple of seasons was \\"That's a line I can't cross.\\"  Well, those lines they refused to cross were always moving.    The one exception was HELO, but hewas such a bad actor (or shallow character) that you don't really care about him.    The show tried hard to be more like our current society, abandoning the laser guns for 9mm rounds.  Freedom was a privilege instead of a right.  They sword an oath to defend the Articles of Colonization (Constitution), but defacto Marital Law was in effect.  If you produced and didn't exercise your right to speak freely in a way the president or Admiral didn't like then you were \\"free\\".  Otherwise you risked being boarded and shot by the military.  One example was the Tillium ship.  They pretended to allow them freedom, however once the ship decided to leave the fleet the sent the marines after them and commandeered the ship.  If they wanted to take the morally conscionable path, and since this ship was so critical to the rest of the fleet, they should have exercised eminent domain and given them a fair market value for what the fleet \\"public\\" needed.  What exacerbated this was the military was not directed by civilians.  Often you would hear Adama take random questions and declare \\"It's a military decision.\\"    Another example the grey-and-freedom issue was the mutiny/rebellion of Gaeta and Zarek.  What started out as a legitimate right of the people to rebel and assert their natural rights as human beings when their freedom was being trampled on by the arbitrary decisions of tyrants turned very sour.  Both Gaeta and Zarek tainted what they did with poor choices.  The show glorified Adama as this god-like figure who all good people hallowed as The Old Man.    The military in general was glorified as it is in our day.  One member snuck into the military, did a great job, and when her history was found out, Starbuck excoriated her for trying to steal her way into the company of \\"good people.\\"  My wife and laughed out loud, and for a long time this was a funny joke between us.  These \\"good people\\" were portrayed on-screen as the dregs of humanity.  Yes they defended the fleet againstthe Cylons, but as Adama queried in the first season: \\"Is what we're fighting for worth saving?\\"  You could ask the same of our society while we pretend to fight for \\"freedom\\".    The question of religion is always there, and they never completely answer the question as to whether it is real in this fictional world or not, but it is clear that the writers are atheistic.  They portray religion as something vain people spout to gain a following, and of course some are \\"duped\\" and believe they are really following \\"God's Plan.\\"    They used the word \\"frack\\" all of the time instead of the real f-word.  At first it was comical, until they used it so much and just like usage of the real f-word that it became disgusting itself.    In the end I watched every episode to find out what the answers to the questions were, and I was disappointed.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I am not writing this to bad mouth the movie!!  I am writing this in reference to AMAZON!!  I pre-ordered this movie over 2 weeks ago.  You would THINK you would get it on the release day.  Well NO!!  It is Monday Dec. 6.  And still havent gotten it.  Wow , I saved 3.50, I could of bought it at the store.  So people, be very careful on what you PRE-ORDER!!!!!!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This movie was FANTASTIC!!  I loved it so much!  If you are a Twilight fan you must get this movie.  It follows very closely to the books, but the changes that were made makes the movie better instead of taking away from it!
B00095NX9G|5.0|Loved the easy to follow yoga techniques and the belly dance drills.  Favourite is the choreography piece with only brass instruments in the soundtrack, thought it was quite stunning.
0307454541|4.0|So I read this book because of the hype. I see it everywhere: on amazon, barnes &noble, costco, etc,... Ok it is not like I expected. The first half of the book is boring, yes. In fact it could be super boring if you do not seriously read the book. I read some reviews and they say the interesting part begins after 1/3 of the book. Noooo! It is still boring until you reach 50% of it. then you will find yourself hooked, guaranteed!<br /><br />This is a long trilogy. I have a feeling that the author tried to make it as long as possible by writing down everything (just like I do with my essays lol) But that is the way he builds the story. It makes you feel like living with the characters.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have to agree with several of the points I read in the one star review category.  I read all the books in less then 4 days but I was annoyed at Mockingjay.  I wanted the book to be better, have more and have Katniss be more.  Her constant aimlessness gets irritating.  Even if it isn't constant but it does seem like that.  She's a smart girl - do something with it.  Her selfishness by not helping Peeta get better but instead writing him off is almost loathsome.  Peeta is a great character and until this book you realize he really does make her.  Like the last two books said too. Peeta is what makes Katniss.     I think though you have to keep in mind that Katniss is a teenager who has had to raise her family since she was 12 and has been in very hard circumstances up until the ripe age of 17.  She is not emotionally developed and deals poorly with her feelings.  I think she does to everyone what she did to her mom.  Put up a wall so she wouldn't get hurt. Doesn't let people in unless they were in already.  I think the only person she doesn't do this to is Prim.  Prim and Peeta are very much alike in character.  Peeta is kind and smart and loves Katniss unconditionally removing the hijacking part.  Of course she ends up with Peeta but I have to admit this comes across like an after thought.  It's a let down.  There are some unanswered questions as well.      I have reread parts of the book and gave it another review in my head.  I wasn't expecting her to be some major revolutionary source, she never wanted that, even in book two but I did expect her to be more.  To show more feelings, to come to the conclusion that she loves Peeta not just because he shows up and Gale doesn't.  It would have been nice to see her grow emotionally and mature through helping ones she loves, make more friends and resolve the Gale issue by realizing he wasn't for her earlier.  The girl always had issues but it would have been nice to see her develop more.  It's a good book but the firsttwo were better.
B0045JK6G0|2.0|I have enjoyed the series thus far although it could be condensed.  Out of the four books this book is my least favorite.  The ending is very disappointing.  Why would an author spend hundreds of pages building up to a big climactic battle only to have it disapate?  Bella gets fake identification cards and arranges travel for Jacob and her daughter.  The Cullen clan travel the globe finding witnesses.  When everyone returns and witnesses arrive they proceed in training for battle.  Bella discovers she has an unusual talent and fosters it to an important defense mechanism for the battle to come....then....then....the battle doesn't happen??  I mean all the planning and preparation and then nothing??  Such a let down to what could have been an interesting event.
B002ZG999U|5.0|If your expectations for this film was a dramatic love story, a deep meaningful message, or some kind of glee club sing and dance bull-ish then you have no reason watching it!! If you are a fan of old school action movies then you will love this movie. Stallone does it again by showing all these clowns how to make a real action movie just like he did with the latest Rocky and Rambo. This movie is combat veteran approved!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The series is not like the book and I enjoyed it much more than the books.  The series seems well acted and hasn't gotten too redundant yet with the romantic triangle.  The two main characters didn't go through much change in my opinion.  I know that Elena is dealing with the death of her parents (her brother Jeremy is having problems coping too); but other characters keep reminding her that it happened months ago and it is time to get past it which somehow belittles Elena's emotional problems.  Bonnie, one of her best friends, seems to go through the most dramatic changes and turns very angry and hatefull.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|For those disappointed that Christina Aguilera's followup album to Back to Basics didn't have a jazzy/bluesy second half, this album is a gift. Aguilera has a phenomenal voice that comes across in these songs. All of her songs, other than Bound to You, are upbeat and just sexy, fun songs where you can enjoy the range of her voice and talent.     \\"But I Am A Good Girl\\" especially reminds me of something from Chicago or Moulin Rouge... sort of like Marilyn Monroe's \\"Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend\\" but different. It's one of my favorites, but all of Aguilera's songs are good.    I love that they used excerpts of Marlyn Manson's \\"Beautiful People\\" for the same titled song. It's interesting to hear Aguilera's voice against a rock background for at least parts of the song. Now I'm wishing and hoping for Christina Aguilera to put out a rock album, sorta No Doubt or Evanescence like. A girl can hope...    I haven't really listened to Cher's earlier stuff. Her voice is a lot huskier than I prefer but these two songs show she's a very talented singer. The first is sort of upbeat whereas the second is slow. Each time I listen to the album, the more I fall in love with \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\"    Listen to the samples. They're pretty accurate representations of the songs. If you like the clips, just know there's a whole lot more of that on the album! In fact, my only complaint about this album is that it isn't longer!
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I never saw this movie advertised.  We only rented it via Amazon Unbox because it was one of the 99 cent Black Friday deals.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Very entertaining.  I even watched it twice.  I'm not sure if it's suited for children due to the fight scenes children/teens are involved with but for 18+, it's awesome.
0307408833|5.0|I love this cookbook!  Most of the recipes are delicious.  Some of them require ingredients that you wouldn't normally have around the house, but that's what happens when you need to eat gluten-free!  I live in Portland, Oregon, and we have numerous grocery stores that carry unusual/alternative ingredients.    Erin McKenna, I can't wait till you release another cookbook!
B003YOZNBK|3.0|I've been a Jonah Hex fan since the seventies, and I love escapist cinema. I think this film captures the spirit of the character and translates it fairly well for a modern audience. A classic work of cinematic art? Decidedly not. But then, it's obviously too tongue-in-Jonah's-right-cheek to be aiming for that. It's kind of like an extended episode of Briscoe County, with Jonah Hex in place of Briscoe. For a fun, escapist bit of Saturday afternoon cinema, it's not so bad, not so bad at all.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|There are hardly any trilogy where the third movie is the best of the bunch.  Toy Story 3 is definitely in this elite class.  Having seen all the first two movies in the theater and many times on DVD and TV, I've gotten to know these characters and truly enjoy them.  When I heard about Toy Story 3, I was a little apprehensive.  After all these years, could they really do a good job with it?  Pixar has had so many successes that it was time to have a failure, right?  Boy was I wrong.  The folks at Pixar hit this one out of the ball park.  It captures all the fun of the first two movies and added a new major element - sorrow, to the story.  I was on a roller coaster ride of joy, happiness, sadness, anger, sorrow, and closure.  If this movie is not nominated for an Academy Award, it would be a shame.      As far as the four-disc combo, I purchased it and have only watched the DVD.  I don't own a blu-ray yet but soon will.  The movie is as good on DVD as it was in the theater.  Highly recommended for anyone who loved the first two Toy Story movies but also anyone who has never seen a Toy Story movie.  As a stand alone movie, it works very well and your knowledge of the previous movies only adds to the enjoyment.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|My description of this cd is Cool!  Great guitars and bass, strong vocals, unique sound and tight drums.  They make good solid rock music with a modern flair.  If you like rock music, give this a try - you'll like it.
B003YHSE7W|2.0|Not as good as the first Iron Man.  Iron Man 2 was totally predictable from beginning to the end with just okay special effects.  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect choice for the playing Iron Man character.  I should have rented the movie before I purchased it.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies/musicals. It is so creative. I have watched it numerous times. I actually got the deluxe set with two CD's. The extras, alone, are worth watching. I can't believe this movie didn't win any major awards. The director is so exacting with her details. Now she is working on the Spiderman musical in New York. I highly recommend this video. If you watch the extras you will have a more appreciative view of the immense work it took to create this video.
B000VECAEO|5.0|It's a mix of laughter and sadness with this ninth season, as it's the last episodes of a long-running successful comedy that has brought entertainment to countless viewers.    John O'Hurley and Patrick Warburton reprise their guest roles as Peterman and Puddy, rounding out the talented cast.    Particularly hilarious episodes include \\"The Butter Shave,\\" where George, who attended a job interview with a cane after his accident the previous season, gives his new boss the impression that he's handicapped. Unwilling to give up all the amenities the company is eager to provide him, George continues the charade. \\"The Serenity Now,\\" where George's parents adopt a phrase in attempts to calm themselves during stressful situations -- which, of course, knowing the Costanzas, is not exactly stressless.     \\"The Merv Griffin Show,\\" where Kramer discovers the talk show's old set in a Dumpster and decides to resume it in his own apartment; \\"The Strike,\\" where Kramer is finally called back to his job at the bagel shop after a decade-long strike;     The finale is a two-parter, and there's also a two-part clip show. While fans of the show will be sure to be disappointed the long-running series concludes here, they'll also be pleased with a solid final season.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books of all time.  I own three copies of the book and finding myself reading at least once a year.  I have never seen a version of Jane Eyre that I have been satisfied with yet, so I was a bit hestitant when I decided to purchase this.  I was not disappointed! This is an excellent reproduction of Jane Eyre, even if it did not follow the book to the letter I felt that all the differences went well with the story.  The acting is wonderful, I have never seen a better Jane in Ruth Wilson, she is almost what I had imagined Jane to be.  Toby Stephens also does an excellent job as Mr. Rochester, even though he is a bit too handsome for the part but I can't decide if this is because I just fall in love with him right along with Jane and he becomes more handsome to me or if he is that way originally.  The only flaw that I found with the entire movie is in the second half how Jane has flashbacks back to her time on the moors and before she escaped from Thornfield.  I think that these scenes do not flow as well as the rest of the movie but even this does not hurt any of the value.
1592289444|4.0|If you enjoy Human interest and Historical books, the autobiographical , The  Long Walk, by Slawomir Rawicz  is excellent! I could not put it down!! The story was almost unbelievable!! The Tale of capture, torture, transport, planning of escape and then the incredible journey to freedom and safety across Siberia , dessert and Himalayas is truly riveting!       Many of the over 250,000 soldiers and 1 million civilians  perished the rigours of the transport, bitterly cold winter and inhumane treatment at the hands of the Soviet captors and Siberian cruel winter.     It is proof of the limits that some people have the physical and mental toughness to endure!!    It has been made into a movie, called The Way Back, release Date 2011. [[ASIN:B004C45AZU The Way Back]]    If you enjoy these kind of autobiographical books, I  recommend two others below.     Another autobiographical book of a similar but  more complete and with  \\"world perspective\\" on the case of WWII Soviet -Polish  and Western Allies relations,   is - An Army in Exile, by General Wladyslaw Anders.[[ASIN:0898390435 An Army in Exile: The Story of the Second Polish Corps (Allied Forces Series)]]    He was the leader Polish 2nd Army Corp, reconstituted of the soldiers and civilians taken prisoner by  the greatest Nazi Collaborators at the beginning of WWII-the  Soviets. It too is a gripping tale, from a leader who had been wounded and captured by the Soviets in Sept 1939, imprisoned and tortured, finally released in 1941 when the Soviets were desperate for military help to defend against their former Nazi allies. It goes on to describe how they managed to leave the difficult conditions in Russia and bring with them some of  thousands of starving young Polish Children, who had also been exiled to Siberia....      This leads to a recommendation  for another excellent autobiographical account that demonstrates  how these children, once out of Soviet control, survived.  The book is  Stolen Childhood  by Father Lucjan Krolikowski [[ASIN:0595168639 Stolen Childhood: A Saga of Polish War Children]]     Father Krolikowski himself had been captured by the Soviets in 1939 as a teenager. He was studying to be a priest at Franciscan Monastery.  Sent to a  labor camp. After their release, the orphaned , starving children were eventually settled in camps located in Africa. Father Lucjan later joined them, to be their priest and guardian, in well organized camps. These camps were  set-up virtually in the jungle!  After the end of the War, the camps were being closed and Fr. Krolikowski was one  of the persons that were essential to get them safely from Africa to eventually to the province of Quebec, Canada to waiting adopting families.   He describes vividly how he and other caring people had to work against the considerable reach of the Soviets, that were trying to gain control of the children they helped to make orphans again!       I hope you enjoy these books about the inspirational resiliency of the human spirit and body! They also help provide insight to a more balanced world view!    GeorgeZ
B004FDY4LE|5.0|Wow.  A very short first season comes to a surprising end.  After becoming addicted to the graphic novel, I was definitely filled with mixed emotion when I heard a television series was in the works.  I rank the graphic novel with the highest marks possible but was not sure how it would translate when presented in episodic television format.  I do admit readily, that I was disappointed by the extra characters which were not in the novel, i.e. Dale and Merle, what would they possibly add to the story, I think they perhaps put Merle in so that he can re-emerge at some later time, unexpectedly.  If you have not read the graphic novel, just pick it up, read a portion of it and you'll see why it was green-lighted for TV.  It is otherwise brilliant.<br /><br />Now in the season finale, they do away with a character or two, I guess which is why there are extras put in in the first place. The doctor in this episode is convincing and yes, I did shed a tear or two.  I cringed a little when Shane tried to explain himself to Lori during a drunken moment.  I wonder how much longer his character will last.<br /><br />If you are Walking Dead graphic novel fan, you know that by now, Shane (Rick Grime's good buddy) should be dead. Also Carol's abusive husband was not a character in the series but was spoken of as a memory or a flashback, if you will, when Carol is opening up to someone, I believe it was Lori. Rick never told Morgan (guy in his neighbor's house after he returned after his coma) that he would continue contact via walkie talkie.  I will not spoil it too much and just say, read the novel, dude. At this point in the story for tv, someone is pregnant. Woops, I had to drop that in in case you needed more incentive to continue watching. Although this is a different animal, it is still Robert Kirkman's creation, perhaps a test tube or birthed by a surrogate but it still has his DNA and therefore, I will stick around to see how the story-lines are treated.  Will the governor be appearing soon, Michonne? When and where? Who will they cast?<br /><br />I appreciate that the \\"walking dead\\" are not supernaturally strong beings as in other zombie movies or stories.  That just doesn't make sense.  If dead tissue were somehow reanimated, why would it return from decay and death to be even stronger and sturdier than when it were alive and well.  That simply doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Curiosity, if nothing else, will keep me in for the long haul! So many twists and turns, possibilities to expand on the original story as outlined in the novel.  I have been won over and hopefully, they will keep me coming back for more every week.soon, Michonne? When and where? Who will they cast?

0307454541|5.0|From the first page we are introduced to a mystery.  Someone is sending a flower to the head of the Vanger family each year.  The small problem being the person most likely to be sending it has been dead for years.  So who is behind this and why?  We also meet Mikael Blomqvist a radical jounalist of whom it is said bears a striking resemblance to the writer himeslf, Steig Larsson.  The girl with the dragon tatoo is introduced and she doesn't disapoint.  Salander is independent, bisexual and an incredibly talented computer hacker.  She is tiny, bit also a black belt.  As some of the characters discover, you really, really don't want to mess with her.  Hardly a disney princess heroine, but this is the beauty of Lisbeth.  She is like nothing we have seen before.  Together with Blomqvist she uses her phenomenal skills with her laptop to deliver some serious justice to a man who hates women, and also to a group of undercover Swedish intelligence.  So, mystery and crime and yes, there are some romantic interludes as well, but perhaps not as obvious as you might think.  There are definitely some pickled herrings along the way.  Sweden as the country itself is shown in all aspects too....yes, the gorgeous snowy pinewoods are there and so is the magnificent town of stockholm, bit beware, sinister things lurk in those forests.....
B003VANOFY|5.0|Logitech did not disappoint with this headset.  I snatched up a WoW Sound Blaster headset immediately when they launched it before this device was announced and when the logitech launched I picked it up.  Personally I like the software package with the Logitech much better.  It tells you how much battery life you have so you don't have to guess when you should plug it up.  Most other wireless headsets just cut out when the battery dies on you; or at most beep at you once beforehand.  I also like the ability to just flip up the mic or even if you don't flip it up there is a light on the end of it that indicates it is muted.  Which the WoW SB headset lacks.  All in all a fabulous headset. Very comfortable for extended use as I occasionally have it on for 8+ hours at a time.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|The Kings of Leon took the old fashioned route to stardom; they made consistent albums, toured relentlessly, ignored trends and waited for the world to catch up. Their fifth album, \\"Come Around Sundown,\\" capitalizes on that steady as we go philosophy by keeping to the basics. Caleb Followill still sings like he's got honey in his mouth, the guitars are big and echoed, yet trace their roots to Southern Rock via U2's arena blast, and the songs themselves are rants and rolls about love, women and sex.<br /><br />If you caught on to Kings Of Leon via \\"Only By The Night's\\" hits, that will probably suit you just fine. For those of us with the band since \\"Youth and Young Manhood,\\" this will fee like a holding pattern. Granted, they are still messing with the formula (the dow-woppy \\"Mary\\" or the slide guitar country of \\"Back Down South\\"), for the most part, \\"Come Around Sundown\\" sounds pat.<br /><br />That still isn't enough to wash them off just yet, as both \\"The End\\" and the hooky \\"Radioactive\\" hit the right spots. \\"Beach Side\\" could be the smoothest track they've done so far. The bass line in \\"Pony Up\\" makes me smile each time I hear it. Kings Of Leon have yet to disappoint me, and even though \\"Come Around Sundown\\" doesn't show the kind of exponential progressions that the first four albums did from each other, it's still a great rock album from a band at the top of their game.

B002ZG99QS|5.0|Tough gig, you would think, reprising a film that sank almost without trace 28 years ago. But [[ASIN:B00006FI57 Tron]] sank in heavy seas: it was released within a month of Stephen Spielberg's [[ASIN:B0009UCEV4 E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial]] and a fortnight of Ridley Scott's [[ASIN:B000VPP84W Blade Runner]], both by common consent amongst the inner circle of all-time science fiction greatness, and against both it does seem rather a pale facsimile. Yet it does have its adherents: it picked up and kept a cult following, some of whose membership were in evidence at the London premi&egrave;re of its long awaited (by them) sequel, Tron: Legacy, still toting their original 1982 Tron tee-shirts etc. 1982's Tron did have Jeff Bridges, these days a much-loved elder statesman of dudeness even if, in 1982, [[ASIN:B000ECXV2I The Big Lebowski]] was still a decade and a half away. In any case, it still had enough of a pulse to dare Disney to get out the CPR machine.<br /><br />The thing is, if anything, Tron was the visionary film of those three. William Gibson cites it as an influence for his seminal 1984 novel [[ASIN:0006480411 Neuromancer]], and its parallels with the [[ASIN:B000WBZZ20 Matrix]] and [[ASIN:B002H9WHHG Terminator]] franchises are plain to see. This was the direction Science Fiction was destined to take, and for all its historical consequence, E.T. didn't leave much of a legacy.<br /><br />Twenty eight years later, another 80s blockbuster that looms large is Back to the Future. Jeff Bridges has been remade as a digital avatar of his former self, and appears not only as the grizzled country and western singer we now know and love, but as his 35 year old alter-ego on the Grid, Clu. For the spods amongst us, that in itself is enough of a reason to turn up, and it's no surprise to hear they've done an incredible job on this. It is genuinely eerie: it's just about discernible that this is a computer regeneration, but it's hard to put a finger on how. It was enough to have me wondering whether the Screen Actor's Guild should go on strike about this, and conclude that they'd better not, because the eggheads would be able to cope without them.<br /><br />As is sadly de rigueur these days Tron: Legacy is in 3D, though not always: the first scenes of the film, set in real-life 1989 were not, and I opted to take my foggy little spectacles off. That I would not recommend though, because as Sam Flynn goes into the grid we are magically transported into 3D in a reveal not unlike the bursting Technicolor of the Wizard of Oz, and this is worth seeing.<br /><br />Still, I am sick of 3D, sick of the extortionate prices cinemas think they can charge for it, and I hope we'll get over this fad soon and go back to making good old fashioned 2D films where director concentrate on dramatic, rather than visual, extravagance.<br /><br />That's not to deny the importance of visual design, of course, which is so spectacular in this film that it would almost succeed on production design alone. Tron: Legacy is a truly wonderful film to look at and there were occasional breath-taking tableaux which, in my frame of reference, handsomely outdid anything the saccharine day-glo of Avatar could muster.<br /><br />The visual scheme is matched by the audio one. Daft Punk (who make a cameo appearance) have picked the musical vibe exquisitely: somewhere between the pulsing electronica of Jean Michel Jarre's [[ASIN:B00004UOVR Oxygene]] and the icy square-wave soundscapes of [[ASIN:B000Z0OX9O Vangelis]], but with a rocking beat. It is hard to overstate how important the soundtrack is here: I've tried and failed to get to grips with Daft Punk before, but this one puts them into a new space.<br /><br />So to the drama. Now there are parts of the screenplay (and Tron's, er, legacy) that aren't a million miles away from preposterous farce. Debutant director Joe Kosinski's achievement is, as the saying goes, to have the courage to change those things he can, the patienceto accept those he can't, and the wisdom to know the difference. Given how seriously the film takes itself - there is absolutely no self-aware sniggering going on here of the sort you'd expect as the standard issue post-ironic response to the silly old eighties - it is all the more an achievement that Kosinski gets away with it. He's helped ineffably by Jeff Bridges, given these days to lampooning himself (in the 20 years he's been on the grid Kevin Flynn has amalgamated with The Dude, and the Dude has come out on top), and who brings some mystic, bearded Zen magic to the picture. Star Wars is visually checked on a number of occasions, not the least by Bridges' hessian hooded Alex Guinness rendition.<br /><br />Sure, Tron: Legacy calls to mind the Matrix, Blade Runner and Terminator (but no more than these films call to mind Tron) but somehow something more subtle is being said. Here I think we are helped, rather than hindered, by Tron's hokey original premise (being one of the facets Kosinski definitely could not change). Because the film's set up is so nonsensical and (contrary to Matrix) no time is invested in explaining it - how or why, for example, a human could wind up in a computer or why, if those MacGuffin Frisbee things are so important, it would ever be a good idea to throw them around like laser boomerangs - the viewer is left with no choice but to accept the basic resting-state absurdity of the platform and simply engage in the film itself. And this is really fun to do.<br /><br />It isn't perfect, then, and thereby hangs the tale: this is the very point. (Tron: Legacy repeatedly curls back on itself like this - I am still turning such things over in my mind 24 hours later). The film's moral is that striving for perfection in itself is quixotic: perfection is unknowable, unattainable, and fractal: no amount of additional detail, analysis or processing power will get you to a place which simply can't exist in the first place, and the assumption that it can - and its quest - is in itself destructive and damaging.<br /><br />Here, again, Tron: Legacy arcs back, reflexively on itself like a screaming lightcycle. For the grid is near perfection, but it's an empty, barren, cold and heartless place. The enhanced digital wizardry updates and supercharges the original, but never loses that anachronistic vision of the future from 1982 (in this way, really taking us back to the future). Once upon a time it seemed cool to think that the future would be all polished chrome, neon and rectangles - that dust and decay would be banished. Indeed, as a vision of the future, that takes us back further yet: for all the resemblance Tron: Legacy has to the Matrix and Terminator (and, as noted, that's a two-way street), the film whose spirit it summons most notably is Fritz Lang's Metropolis.<br /><br />Truly back to the future, then:  the *real* feel of the future, but as apprehended in 1982 (or even 1928): a glacial, angular, geometric dystopia of black, chrome and white neon. Nowhere is this more prominent than in the film's one moment of light relief: a cameo by British actor Michael Sheen who, having recently played Tony Blair and David Frost, seems himself to have been playing with Marty McFly's De Lorean, and has brought to the screen a white-washed character that is one part Ziggy Stardust, one part Frank-N-Furter, one part Gary Numan (and a dash of Godzilla for all the scenery he chews). It isn't entirely clear what else he's there for - there are shades of the Merovingian in him, too, come to think of it - other than to nudge the plot towards its denouement but again, there's enough going on (and he's funny enough) that it really doesn't matter.<br /><br />If there are false steps they are towards the end, which gravitates towards a needlessly Spielbergian apocalyptic climax which the film really doesn't need, and there was probably a spaceship dogfight too many (again, so much Star Wars), but along the way there are so many beautiful scenes, and the production design is so impressive, that I still left the theatre blown away by the whole experience.

Yes, it is a somewhat large book, but it has been read and reread so many times since he first opened it.  His nine year old sister read it so much as well that we bought her the DC Comics Encyclopedia[[ASIN:0756641195 The DC Comics Encyclopedia, Updated and Expanded Edition]] for her birthday. Now they know more about comic book superheroes than I do!  The pages have great illustrations and loads of information on each of the characters.  Some characters have multiple pages of information as well.  Highly recommended.  Great gift.

But compared to most other rock and roll titles I own on cd, this one doesn't sound as full on my car stereo.  At least not the familiar tracks.  I'm not an expert on the subtleties of remastering that other reviews have criticized.  I just feel something has been subdued in this old classic record.  I do enjoy the live \\"Tommy\\" disc though.  It seems to come through a little better somehow.    I prefer the studio recorded, classic titles...particulary \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Tommy\\".  I usually choose the original albums, but the two-disc, anthology \\"Ultimate Collection\\" is also a good way to enjoy rock and roll music.
0553805371|3.0|This was a good review of the field with some new items.  It would still be a blur for someone without some quantum mechanics background.  The conclusions did not seem rigorous, but more for a comfortable fit.  Maybe it is an irrational human want, requiring cause and effect, but I was hoping for an answer to the question:  How did the infrastructure for the laws of the universe come to exist?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I had passed this dvd title several times while wandering the aisles of Blockbuster over the years.  I recently rented it finally and was very pleased I did.  I then ordered it on Amazon to keep among the modest collection of movies I own.    I was a teenager during the Nixon years and I remember the evening news with the Vietnam casualty totals reported like it was the Dow Jones average.  The draft ended just before I turned 18 years of age.  I went on to college and didn't serve in the military...(a reality I regretted later in life when I finally learned what was important to me).  If you are of similar age, you may remember protest attitudes.  Over the years I've ejoyed reading history, and invested some effort reading about the subject of Vietnam.  \\"Fire In The Lake\\", Karnow's \\"Vietnam, A History\\", \\"The Best and The Brightest\\", just to name a few better known books.  And as it turned out in life, I developed friendships with a few military veterans of that era.      Still, I'm no expert on much of anything, but I thought this documentary about McNamara was excellent.  It's put together in a very interesting format that I think would be accessible to even someone unschooled on the subjects covered. And it covers a great deal more subject than just Kennedy/Johnson and southeast Asia.  I could understand criticism that it was an attempt to repair his reputation near the end of his life.  I'd be inclined to see some good in his character, though I'd say he must have been \\"cold-blooded\\".
142311339X|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old granddaughter so that she will have a better understanding of English. We are from Norway. It`s not easy to find an English book in Norway that will catch and hold such a young persons attention  for long, especially in a foreign language. She loves it! It is funny and thrilling and I am very pleased that I found such a book at Amazon. I am sure she will finish the book, it is magic, and then she will have a good understanding of the English language. The book is highly recommendable for young persons that are interested in greek mythology.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I can pretty much sum up my opinion of this movie up by my reaction to the long, drawn out, adrenaline-packed action sequence that is de rigueur in animated movies, in this case in Christmas Future when Scrooge is being chased by the giant black horses down the streets and down more streets and down even more streets and down yet even more streets and finally down the sewer: is there a point to this and is it ever gonna end? And the Ghost of Christmas Present with his incessant booming laugh is the most annoying character since Jar Jar Binks. The characters and storyline are two-dimensional, and are only there to justify one heavy-handed dramatic scene after another. If you must see it, rent it for a buck ninety-nine at Red Box and be glad afterward that you didn't pay full price for it.
0316069906|2.0|I have been a vegetarian my entire life.     This book is ok at times, at other times the author goes on for page after page without information. Instead of providing info and letting the reader think for themselves, the author spends more time discussing his own ideas and questions with the reader.      The author is a philosopher, but apparently not a very bright one, and he has a lot of meaningless, largely semantic questions to suggest to the reader. There are so many paragraphs/pages in the book that I had to skip because he wasn't actually saying anything, just talking to himself in circles.     I cannot recommend the book. The author's writing style and style of logic are both seriously flawed. The amount of raw data in the book is lacking. Don't waste your money!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|There is not a song on here that skips a beat or you don't want to sing along to! It gives you what the movie is about heart, soul and phenomenal vocals from today's two pop divas. It has every song performed in the film including the song played in the beginning of the end credits. If you loved the movie, this a definite must have! You will listen to it over and over again and love it even more if that is possible. Can't wait for the dvd!!!
0393061310|5.0|If from history methodology we think that recorded history provides only roughly 50% of what happened, this book is helpful for us to have a broader view of humanity.    I think this book is not about stressing European viewpoint, but provides a new perspective of how we come to be.  Near the end of the book (2005 edition), he talks about the evidence of the origins of the current Japan and Korean people.  That really opens my eyes.  On the part of China around 15th century, I know what he means, based on my understanding of Ming Dynasty (sea ban), it helps me move from a China-centered history view (from 2000BC to modern) to a global view.    Maybe more or less we all come from the similar ancestors (I don't mean the single cell or DNA hundred million years ago), but due to limited knowledge, environments, and development, each tribe or nation evolved from a simple society to complicated one, and fought for dominance or survival.    It is not a definitive history book.  It helps change ourselves to be more open-minded and thus lead to new ideas. Maybe one day we will fight exoplanet lives who found the Earth is an interesting place and wants to colonize, just as Europe did to American Indians before.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|No, this isn't the original show.  If you compare the two and you are looking for the newer version to be a duplicate of the original show, you may be disappointed.    However, if you try to enjoy the new Five-O as a completely new show (with some similarities to the original), it's one of the most exciting new shows out there (IMHO) - along with Blue Bloods.    The scenery is great (plenty of nice shots of Hawaii, the cast works well together.  I enjoy the banter between Danny and Steve.  The plots have mostly been excellent and well executed.  Looking forward to the DVD release of this new show.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Come on guys. This is beautiful. It's Annie Lennox. It's not supposed to be some uber-traditional Christmas album. The arrangements are unique, the voice is hers. I will listen to it a LOT in the next few weeks, along with the Chieftains' The Bells of Dublin.
B004B4JGHE|5.0|Wow another truly great effort from KU to his fans.  I ordered my CD from Target to get the extras and in the week before I got it, I had all the 8 songs memorized .. very sweet.  I'm excited to hear everything Live next year while KU is on tour.  My favorite song is The Luxury of Knowing .. his voice the tone is amazing.  That one will really have the crowd speechless when performed.  Georgia Woods and Long Hot Summer get us moving and shaking and the guitar on Georgia Woods .. can't wait to see that extended in concert.  All in all a really great package for fans, Monkeyville Members and the world.  Thanks Keith.
0525951652|2.0|Follett tries to do for WWI what Wouk did for WWII, but not successfully. The book is about 500 pages too long, with very tedious political discussions taking up much of the space. Follett also seems to be obsessed with peoples' first sexual experiences, and we get to witness, in detail, the deflowering of several virgins, both female and male.     This could all be forgiven if Follett had given us characters we could care about. The most sympathetic character is a German Major, with the others all being spoiled aristocrats or spunky socialists.    I like to study history through novels, and there is some good information in this book, but it was done better by Jeff Shaara (To the Last Man: A Novel of the First World War), in far fewer pages.     I will not bother with the sequel, but I may go back and read the two Herman Wouk tomes about WWII.
B003VBVQKI|4.0|Come Taste The Band came out 2 years before I was born, so at the age of 18, the supposed sacrelige of replacing Blackmore with Bolin was but a distant memory in rock history.  I came into this album with no preconceptions.  Is it a Deep Purple record?  Well, probably not.  Nowadays this would be touted as a supergroup, and renamed.  But I think back in the 70's, record labels relied too heavy on brand recognition, rather than the integrity of the brand.  But it says Deep Purple on it, so to me, it's always been a Deep Purple album.  And a great Tommy Bolin album too!    The 2 LP set is very nicely packaged, great heavy stock liners, full color fully printed on both sides.  Very snazzy.  The vinyl pressing quality is great.  I'm not sure I would classify it as audiophile, but it's not far.      I find the remaster (LP1) to be rather uninspiring.  I'd have preferred a cleaner pressing of the original master if it was available.  The new version is not bad, but it's not as raw as the original, and I think that takes away from the rock vibe a bit.  The bass is tighter, adding to the funky feel a bit.      Record 2 is the real gem for me.  The remixes sound great, the separation of the instruments in the mix is much better than the original.  On the original version, Tommy's opening little solo on 'Comin' Home' screams in, and then sounds like somebody lowered the fader a bit.  The remix is much more even, with the guitar being equally audible as the original through better stereo field placement.  Rhythm guitars and pianos are heard in the new mix that were inaudible originally.  The new mixes also seem to have sections that have been spliced out of the original mix, and also, the tracks are allowed to finish right to the end of the recording, rather than fade, which gives us Bolinheads a few more precious minutes of his playing.    Pick it up if you can, I hear it's already out of print.
0439023521|1.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" in which children are drawn from different regions and put into a competition where they have to kill each other. The last one breathing wins national fame and a lifetime of luxury. I'm not sure which is more horrific: the novel itself, the fact that it's so popular, or that it's marketed at middle school book fairs. No wonder kids are so messed up these days ... can't blame this one on TV or video games. I'm not a fan of censorship by any means, but would discourage kids from reading this one.
0240816250|5.0|When this book arrived on my doorstep, I was instantly impressed. This is one of those books that you can whack someone over the head with and cause some serious trauma. Then you open it up and it just keeps getting better.<br /><br />I am a photographic amateur - my experience revolves around point-and-shoot cameras with a little smattering of DSLRs. I've never taken a professional course in photography or developed negatives. This book was very, very outside of my realm of expertise. That being said, it is very easy to appreciate the comprehensiveness of this volume. The text jumps straight into negative development with little to no preamble. This book is not made to make you feel comfortable and to console you - it assumes you know exactly what the text is talking about, and if you don't, you need to read up on the subject somewhere else. If you are not comfortable mixing your own chemicals and modifying the additives used in the film development cycle, this text will not hold your hand through the process. In this manner, the book reads much like a standard college-level textbook, so much so that I was expecting chapter quizzes at the end of each section.<br /><br />If you are a photographer or film processor looking for new techniques (monochrome or not), this book is for you. If you are a casual photographer who was looking for a book on how to take more dynamic black and white photography, this book is not for you. However, this manual is easily appreciable by any level of photography enthusiast.
0240816250|5.0|I haven't spent much time in a darkroom for some time -- most of my current photography work is digital and has been for years. But, I started off in photography (more years ago that I care to remember) in a traditional darkroom, and have always appreciated what a darkroom could produce given the right set of skills.<br /><br />This book is a fabulous resource to increase your darkroom skills -- 500+ pages of every tip and technique you could hope to know to get the most from your darkroom work.  Be forewarned this is for those people who really want to excel in the traditional photographic darkroom. It is not a book you can go though quickly - it's a reference text that you'll spend many enjoyable hours learning from.<br /><br />Given its depth and complexity, this is not the best book for the absolute beginner as it assumes a certain amount of darkroom and photography foreknowledge.  Think of this book as a thorough workshop in advance darkroom technique.<br /><br />The writing is clear, there are ample illustrations and examples, and the book is well organized. I very much appreciated the chapter on exposing paper negatives and printing from them (a technique I happen to be exploring currently), and the appendix section in the back that provides a basic explanation of the chemistry involved in the traditional darkroom, including formulas.<br /><br />This is definitely a resource you'll want to have on your shelf to consult again and again. Highly, highly recommend.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|This CD is excellent! Bruno's unique and soothing voice is portrayed in a way that keeps you addicted to listening! The album has a variety of styles including pop, reggae, r&b, and ballads. Excellent and fun!
B0000AMRJC|2.0|People fell for Al Pacino overacting all over the place here. There is not one single shot that he is not on screen, it's annoying.<br /><br />If you look below the surface, this movie is long just for the sake of being long, morose and tedious. Performances are usually high, but here not here. Yes, gasp, this is a shallow movie at its core, wrapped in violence to disguise it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|\\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War\\" was written by Max Brooks. The Kindle edition is 352 pages in length.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS...NO SPOILERS<br /><br />The entire book is a series of interviews conducted AFTER the end of the Zombie wars. The interviews are taken in a general chronological order...that is, from the very beginning of the outbreak, where no one was really sure of what was going on, to the end where the 'infestation' has been globally defeated (at least they hope so).<br /><br />The book encompassed individual tales from survivors from around the world...from the arctic to antarctic, all world land masses, oceans and islands...no area was immune as the Earth was literally overrun with undead. All interviewees had some part to play in the wars...some a minor bit involved in some local, isolated 'event', others a major role to play in a more national or global strategy.<br /><br />What impressed me most about the different accounts was this; although each one was a short personal excerpt, they all fitted together perfectly in the telling overall history of the Zombie wars. All stories were varied, unique and interesting; tales of battles in mountains passes, on the plains, on shorelines, on oceans...stories of bravery, isolation and darkness, fear, the humiliation and guilt of leaving others behind while while some fled for their lives. All the tales had a real touch of humanity about them because they not only recounted the actual events of the day, but also took into account how the passage of time could change one's perspective of those horrendous days. And some of these 'insights' were often both very revealing and heart rendering.<br /><br />Concerns:...only one...(the believability factor rears its ugly head once again for me)<br />(SPOILER) The tale of Sensei Tomonaga Ijira...a BLIND Japanese martial arts master who, despite his handicap and being alone, recalls one battle where \\"I dispatched forty-one in as many minutes\\", and then he proceeded to bury them all! This one story, among all these other fabulous and haunting tales was really the only 'weak' spot in the entire book.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />A fabulous book; well written as a series of small vignettes that are filled with the emotional strengths and frailties of human existence when placed under extreme stress. 4 3/4 Stars (1/4 Star off for Ijira's story)<br /><br />Ray Nicholsonamong all these other fabulous and haunting tales was really the only 'weak' spot in the entire book.

B003YUC9JI|5.0|This film is not quite a remake of the original \\"Karate Kid\\" (1984.) In the effort to adjust the movie for China, and give Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) a fuller background they may have improved the story all around.<br /><br />Basically Sherry Parker (Taraji P. Henson) lands a position in China and against her son's wishes takes him along. The son Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) makes friends and a quasi love interest in Meiying (Wenwen Han) and is terrorized by another student Cheng (Wang Zhenwei.) Now he must learn to defend himself and enlists the help of his apartment's handy man Mr. Han. Mr. Han may have a few problems of his own.<br /><br />In the process of training we are treated to a peak at the China of today. However keep in mind this is a movie so names and places have been changed and much of the indoor scenes were make in a studio.<br /><br />The film pretty much matches the formula of the original. I you missed the original film then you will want to read Joseph Campbell's writings on heroes journey or coming of age rituals.<br /><br />Also you may want to watch Michel Wood's \\"Legacy: The Origins of Civilization\\" It gives a better insight as to the nature of China.<br /><br />No matter what you will find that this film has a perfect balance and a little something for everyone.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when Mr. Han perused a fly with chopsticks in hand. That scene is so Jackie Chan.<br /><br />I only saw the Blu- ray version however it had more travelogue description in the DVD extras.
B002VECM6S|4.0|I got this for 4 dollars over black friday. It was backordered, so it took 6 days to ship and then I got it two days later since I have amazon prime.  The paper cover was slight torn on the inside or the plastic.  This was purely cosmetic, but also somewhat disconcerting, since I don't know what could have caused it. Otherwise it is a great movie for an unbelievable price.
B0048LPRCS|5.0|If you purposely searched this film out then its safe to say you know what you are getting into. A very open ended film involving life, death, and everything in between. Not a date movie by any means.  Best watched alone I think.  I've read a lot of reviews by people who watched it on various drugs... I watched it sober, and while I can see how it would be fun to be intoxicated while viewing... there are a couple scenes that could make some individual's trips go sour depending on your own personal life experiences.  Namely a very traumatic car accident.  All n all, this is a very important film... I hesitate to recommend it to ANYONE, but for myself it just became my new #1... and lets be honest, how often does that happen in ones life?
0811870413|5.0|When I read of Chad's concept for home bread baking, I knew that I had to try it.  I'm a professional baker and this was the first attempt at doing a starter at home. I was intrigued to see, if indeed, I could get a professional crust at home. Turns out, yes, the dutch oven cooking works!!!  My loaves were beautiful, with a nice golden crust and they keep for over a week as well.  This bread was wonderful cut and toasted, the flavor was amazing.  This bread takes time, its not a 2 hour loaf of bread.  Take the time to try this bread out, you wont be disappointed!!!    My only other comment is I wish Tartine had a message board where people could post on their bread baking experience from the book.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The product arrived on time in the condition described (new).  It's a fantastic movie and probably one of my absolute favorites.  It balances the typical sappy romantic comedy with the \\"darker side\\" of relationships beautifully.
0545265355|5.0|I read book one in a day, and couldn't wait to start book 2. The trilogy is hard to put down, I had to know what would happen next. The ending sucked, book 3 last few pages were awful, but still worth getting to.
0307346617|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. A friend recommended it to me and I wasn't interested in zombies so I wasn't too excited to read it. But I was enthralled and read it in a manner of days. Definitely buy this book!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Many would say this is the most popular and the best made Becker knife.  The first Becker knife I got was the Becker Necker and I loved it.  But I wanted something just a bit bigger.  Well here it is, perfection in my opinion.  The blade is thicker than probably any blade you have ever owned, virtually unbreakable, and will stay razor sharp for quite a bit of heavy usage.  This thing is built to be used hard.  And the sheath is like the Necker sheath, that kydex material that is ok if it gets wet and keeps the knife secure.    Look at the reviews, this is a sure thing and you won't find this for a price any better.  Get this for virtually any utility purpose, a KABAR USMC to collect (and it's the coolest knife on earth that saved our American asses in more than one war!), and a larger knife like the Ontario Marine Raider SP10 or the Becker BK9 for wood processing and inspiring fear!    Save yourself $100's and get one of these.  Basically this is a $500 knife without the fancy brand name and fancy handle scales (which if you get extra money you can always upgrade the scales).    (PS: GET IT!)
B000002L42|4.0|First of all, If you are a Steely Dan fan, it's hard not to like this album. I think it's asking a bit much to expect the older tunes to sound  like the original LP versions. On some of the songs, Fagan sounds like he's rushing the vocals (Bhoditsatva come to mind). On the slower songs he has more time to do the lyrics justice. Contrary to what some others have written, Becker is a decent singer, I know of lot of 'better' singers who can't match his pitch, timing and expression. One might not like the sound of his voice, but he does a fine job with it.     My issues with the record are that it often lacks a live feel. There's not enough crowd noise, the mix is two-dimensional (too much compression) and the band is just too perfect. It all sounds a bit mechanical when it should be more spontaneous. I don't mind the different arrangements, they add interest. Having said that, I'd kill to have either of the drummers in my own band, not to mention the backup singers, bassist, etc.
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|Ok on the back of case it states \\"...6 part documentary viewable in both standard and picture in picture modes\\"  actually on the DVD side - nothing except 2 commentaries and summit - blu Ray isn't standard so what's the meaning of that ?  No digital copy - no documentary on the DVD side :(  Great movie - horrible release this time around
B001GWK2MC|2.0|Our daughter got this for her 5th birthday. We were smart and bought an 'extended service plan' when we bought it locally so if it popped we could get it replaced for a year. Our kids (8 and 5) loved it and since they are both girls weren't very hard on it. They had a great time until one of them leaned on the corner of the castle and the plastic tore away from the side. It doesn't lose any air because of where it tore but it did break with in the first 3 or 4 weeks of use :(
0525951652|4.0|I would define this novel as a modern and much more accessible War and Peace.  It is a vast epic chronicling a historic conflict (WWI) from the perspectives of different families, much like Tolstoy did with the Napoleonic wars of the early 19th century.  It effectively demonstrated the political climate of the time, mainly from a British standpoint, but there were also key characters from Germany, Russia and America.  It begins with the escalation of hostilities when Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated, and follows the First World War through battles in France, politics in England, revolution in Russia and indecision in the U.S.  Throughout all this, I enjoyed watching the evolution of the characters as they come to terms with their roles during this tumultuous time.  Soldiers, suffragists, politicians and peasants all play a significant part in this engrossing story.<br /><br />There were a few flaws, but none significant enough to affect my overall enjoyment.  I found the discussion of British politics somewhat tedious, since I'm not really familiar with the workings of that government and the different parties.  I was very surprised that the death of the Russian royal family was only mentioned in passing, considering the significance of this event in the Russian Revolution and Grigori's involvement with Lenin and Trotsky.  Otherwise, I appreciated the historical figures that made appearances, the interaction of the characters, and the incredible detail that makes Follett's historical fiction so genuine.  I feel I gained a better understanding of World War I and its long term consequences.  Keeping in mind that this is just the first book in a trilogy, I look forward to encountering these characters again, and based on the foreshadowing in the last few chapters, I have a feeling the second book will deal with the next generation's experience during World War II.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|KISS Alive! (1974) was the band's breakout release, and as legions of fans joined the KISS Army, the group skyrocketed in popularity.  The release of the four solo albums in 1978 under the KISS umbrella, was quite unprecedented in popular music, and was an indication of the individual appeal and \\"charisma\\" of Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss, and Paul Stanley.<br /><br />IKONS (2008) is a four CD compilation that is very much in the spirit of the solo albums, with one disc devoted to each of the four original members.  The songs are taken from KISS albums, and the 1978 solo records.  As Ace and Peter were not featured on vocals as prominently as Paul and Gene, their discs draw more heavily from their solo record.  Focusing on each individual in this way, makes for a concentrated, and pretty cool listening experience, as well as providing some insight into the character of each member.<br /><br />IKONS offers no new material to interest long time fans, but the compilation is an excellent and perhaps ideal choice, for new fans of the original members, looking for a fairly comprehensive collection.  IKONS includes most of the best material from this period of the band's history, as well as providing a great sense of balance between the four members.  The songs are all studio tracks.  No live material is included, and weaker versions of certain songs, have as much as possible, been replaced with superior ones.  The cardboard packaging isn't the greatest, but it does provide a minimal profile, and the outside sleeve does keep things from unfolding.  An included booklet has some nice photos, notes, and song credits.  Reasonably priced, this is an excellent introduction to the Star Child, the Demon, the Cat Man, and the Space Ace.
B003WTE886|4.0|This CD is fantastic.  I can't fault Taylor for the delivery issue.  I order this and another CD, both of which arrived with cracked cases.  To make matters worse, these are gifts.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|Zemeckis strikes again, better than expected! At first when I started to watch this, I did not know it was \\"animated\\" (not cartoon animation, but \\"real animation\\") and said to myself \\"ahhh I hate animated movies, the actors don't have to act, they only need their voices\\". BOY was I WRONG!! As I continued to watch the movie I thoroughly enjoyed it, the closest to Charles Dickens true story I've seen in this old classic. After watching the entire movie I went to the \\"extras\\" and watched how they put this movie together. I found that in my error, the actors have to be exceptional, outstanding, with a great imagination to pull off this movie. Every movement/facial expression is done by the actor himself, not just \\"animation\\". Jim Carrey as always is amazing, but the rest of the cast is outstanding also (Gary Oldman, Colin Firth, Carey Elwes). Gary Oldman as the ghost of Jacob Marley is genius! I am truly happy that I purchased this movie on a whim, as it is the best \\"A Christmas Carol\\" I've seen and I've seen probably most.  Do yourself a favor, treat yourself to this wonderful classic, you will not be dissapointed. Excellent.  ~from a hardcore film buff

Overall, I would totally recommend this workout video for people who want to get fitter, or loose weight! So, go on! Buy it immediately! You will not regret it!
B00139XZF4|3.0|The film has a feeling of being rushed.  There does seem to be some gaps in the storytelling. Also, too many of the actors have only supporting roles and so I was or am hoping that there will be a movie made of the next book (the subtle knife).  But something about the film kept me interested enough that I immediately went out to find the book and read it - very interesting, more so than some of the garbage out there being made into films.  (I have to say I'm still waiting for \\"Spirograph:  The Movie\\" to come out any day written by a Paramount \\"accountant\\" (think \\"star trek: the mutilation\\")and budgeted at 300 million!)<br />Also, it kind of blows me away that the movie made 375 million around the world yet the Jewish guys who greenlighted the film are now afraid of the Vatican?  I understand that the religous right doesn't like the film/books or author but then isn't that a bit ironic in this case?  Could this be part of what he's trying to convey about organized religion in the books?  OMG I'm really on to something here!<br />C'mon, does anybody believe that weenie story about \\"the current global recession\\" being the reason they're not making the sequel?  And I was under the impression that Hollywood was all about the \\"money\\"...go figure.  My question to anyone out there reading this is:  If Hollywood is not about storytelling (good or bad - any story will do) and not about the \\"money\\" then WHAT IS IT ABOUT?<br />(Brain Fart:  It's about the money on the path with the least amount of resistance?)<br />As an aside - thank god for religous freedom here in the USA!
B00005LW7R|4.0|After re-hearing Abbado's great Don Carlos on DGG (the 5 act French leviathan) I thought it would be interesting to hear him conducting Verdi's most gossamer and humorous opera, Falstaff.  I remember hesitating about purchasing this set because I'm not a big Bryn Terfel fan, but I thought that he would be good in a big comic role like this rather than his over-rated Wagnerian attempts with Wotan and the Dutchman.  I was right about that.  Terfel was, in some ways, born to sing Falstaff, at least, up to a point.  He does tend to over-act but he may have caught that bug from the ever-hammy Thomas Hampson who is the Ford on this recording.  In the end Terfel lacks that last ton of rotund tone, making for a lean and slightly meaner buffoon.  He is, however, a vivid character actor and his old fat knight is a complete success as far as a recorded characterization goes, even if he is not steeped in the traditions of performance practice in Verdian roles.  Abbado's women fare better overall than do the men.  Larissa Diadkova has a resinous coppery voice with deep undertones yet with plenty of punch.  Her Quickly is the most successful of the portrayals overall.  Dorothea Röschmann is slightly heavier voiced for Nanetta than you usually encounter.  She lacks the last ounce of sparkling insouciance displayed in abundance by Barbara Hendricks for Giulini in his splendid recording from Los Angeles, still the best one out there in the modern recording category and perhaps the best of them all, well, maybe not quite in the Toscanini legendary league but close.  Röschmann and her Fenton, Daniil Shtoda are a more knowing young couple than, say, the gloriously youthful and utterly charming Inva Mula and Juan Diego Floréz for Muti's splendid film from Bussetto in 2001, available on dvd from Eurosarts and a must-own for lovers of this opera.  Adrianne Pieczonka is a good Alice Ford but a bit faceless.  She sings beautifully, as always, but does not convey the spikier malevolence of her character which adds, perversely, to the comic element of the whole.  Schwarzkopf did this by doing her minxish thing, Daniela Dessi does more of the shrew approach with Muti in his excellent live recording from La Scala.  My favorite Alice is Barbara Frittoli in the aforementioned Muti film from Bussetto.  Hampson is Hampson.  He's still trying to be the new Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and is succeeding beautifully.  He's just as obnoxious and scene chewing as his famous German predecessor but, fortunately, does not have the old man's intellect to shove it down your throat in quite as pushy a manner.  Ford can be a major player in this opera but when a distasteful egomaniacal singer is in the part it easily fades into the background as simply a recurring annoyance.  He sings well enough and Ford is not a likable man anyway, so, it works.  Abbado begins the opera in a quick, light, airy vein, then a slight portentousness takes over.  The crackling energy of the music and the nature of the characters becomes a little set in aspic, the recording becomes very studied and studio bound.  Very nicely sung and played but 'correct' and lacking the bumptious atmosphere of Muti's live set from La Scala with Juan Pons and Daniela Dessi.  For a newer recording of this opera, since 1980, I'd still recommend the Giulini with a splendid cast led by the more sophisticated Falstaff of Renato Bruson and Katia Ricciarelli's appealing Alice.  The classic Karajan with Gobbi and Schwarzkopf is probably still my favorite simply in terms of capturing the naughty sparkling joy of the piece, though the monophonic sound has its limitations, but it is still a good listening experience.  And I like Muti, both his EMI set with Juan Pons and Daniela Dessi, and his fabulous filmed version from Bussetto with Ambrosio Maestri and Barbara Frittoli.  But Abbado's Falstaff is magnificently played by the Berlin Philharmonic and his conducting is generally fluid and effervescent.  He is similar to Giulini in bringing out the subtle darker tinctas in this complex score.  Overall, in spite of HAMpson, I like this recording, enough not to chuck it into the sales bin.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I am a huge Sex and The City fan and although the second was not as exciting as part 1 it was definitely a good storyline for the fans.  This movie get's a A for me, if you followed the series you will enjoy this movie!

0765342294|4.0|If you love sci-fi or even if you just kind of like it you should have already read this but if not there's still time. The story follows Ender as he is shipped off to Battle School and his brother and sister as they begin to create a tangled political atmosphere back on earth while still only children.  It's a quick and easy read you could finish in a weekend.   The ending is satisfying although definitely leaves the reader wanting more, I recommend following it with Ender's Shadow instead of the typical progression to Speaker for the Dead.
0345505387|1.0|I was so excited to see a new Jamie and Claire book from Diana Gabaldon.  I have all her books and read them often.  I understood that it was basically a comic book, so no problem there.  I believed Diana when she said that the story was from Jamie's point of view and that there was a new story line running through it.    COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.  The book was simply a retelling (and not a good one) of Outlander.  If you haven't read Outlander, you will NOT know what is going on in this book.  The new character made NO difference to the storyline.      Although the artwork was fairly well done, all the men looked the same.  I had to keep track of who was who by the color of their kilts.  There were no indications of scene changes - suddenly people would be talking about something different, and you'd have to catch on that you were in a different situation now.      If you really feel you MUST read this book - get it from your local library.  Or you can have mine - I won't be looking at it again.
B0006J28BO|5.0|My 8 year old daughter has loved this movie for a couple of years now. I don't even know how many times we've had to rent it from the library. I was so happy to find it here, and received it in excellent shape, and promptly. This movie is also good for those kids who enjoy anime. I would definitely recommend the movie, and the seller.

B003Y58CKS|5.0|One of the most dramatic and tragic of operas, Verdi's masterpiece is being brought to new life in this German production.<br />In the title role, Serbian baritone Zeljko Lucic portrayed a burly Rigoletto; not really 'hunchback' (though the 'bag' has always been there inside the costumes), but a towering figure both in terms of looks and voice.<br />His portrayal is still fine, even if not in the traditional tragic-buffo school.  Lucic has a huge voice, and he is at the same time able to paint varying shades with his large instrument.  May be he will be a even finer Iago or Macbeth. This conjures up the vexing question of how to cast Rigoletto - I saw Gallo live in this role, and is similary plagued by his height.<br />In the other two lead roles, the physically petite-vocally limpid Diana Damrau is a jewel of a Gilda. It would have been a vocally 'perfect' Gilda had she assumed this role 5 years earlier, before the 16 Die Zauberflote productions robbed Damrau of a considerable amount of her vocal lustre. As it now is, hers is still an exemplary performance, and this is particularly true of her acting skills.  Her vocal technique is rock solid as ever, and her vocal acting never yielded a single inch to the best sopranos who assumed this role.<br />Juan Diego Florez is not entirely comfortable in the role of the Duke of Mantua vocally, but his acting is also oustanding and believable. His chemistry with Damrau's Gilda works really well.<br />The truly outstanding portrayal in this wonderful production is Zeppenfeld as Sparafucile, the Burgundian killer. The voice is a dark bass; Max von Egmond comes to mind immediately upon hearing Zeppenfeld. This is a very rare breed of bass voice.<br />The true glamour of this production, unmistably, lies with the director and the conductor.  The staging is also superb.<br />While I generally detest nudities in operas, the Act I nudities in this production is neither excessive nor distracting; indeed, it is appropriate to the plot and never out of place with the entire stage setup.<br />The staging is modern and minimalist, but the lightings are very effective, and the costumes (masks included) very well designed. Overall, this is modern, but no Eurotrash.  If only all modern European operatic productions could reach this level, well, why should it not be encouraged?th the entire stage setup.

B0036EH3U2|5.0|When they say the \\"Complete Series\\", they mean complete.  You get the mini-series, seasons 1-4, the unrated extended version of Razor, and The Plan.  The Blu-Ray transfer is quite good.  Certain scenes still have some grit in the background but not many.  When you see simulated film grain, it's what RDM wants you to see.  Otherwise the Blu-Ray set has some excellent video detail.  When the Colonials land on Kobol, you can see the forest in verdant detail (the greens are so vibrant, it's like you can count the leaves on the trees).    The Blu-Ray extras include deleted scenes and bonus episodes like the extended version of \\"Pegasus\\".  But the real jewel is the retcon broadcast version of the series.  BSG is edgy.  It draws you in with dynamic characters that grow evolve over the course of the series.  The good guys aren't always good, and the bad guys aren't always bad.  Rather, the characters constantly drift into the gray zone of ethics and morality.  Sometimes they cross the line, and sometimes they hold to their ideals.  It's a roller coaster ride throughout the entire series.  The viewer's sympathies are tugged back and forth.  You like this character; you hate this character.  Then you like him again.  There's action.  There's intrigue.  There's a philosophical meditation on the nature of human condition.  In short, there's something for everyone.  There is a richness and depth for sci-fi fans and non-fans alike.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie, in my opinion, ranks among Angelina Jolie's best films.  It is the true story of Christine Collins whose son went missing in L.A. right out of his home.  And the consequent cover-up and corruption among the L.A. police force when it came to their botched up investigation.  There are horrifying events in this film, so be prepared for a sobering movie viewing experience.  However, overall I found the movie to be enlightening and an eye opener.  From a Women's Studies perspective it shows what life was like during an era where women were assumed to be lacking upstairs and had no voice in society and government.
B000286S8S|5.0|Having grown up in the 90's, I never saw Van Halen in their peak. The only song I'd heard of theirs before purchasing this album was Jump, which is probably the song they are best known for. I wanted to buy an album that had an extensive overview of their music, and this album seemed to be a good place to start.     I'm assuming that most people who would want to buy this album like me don't know much of van halen's music, and if you don't this is the best place to start. It covers all the vital Van Halen Hits including \\"Jump\\", \\"Ain't Talkin' Bout Love\\", and \\"Hot For Teacher\\" as well as many of their other hits. There are albums that are underrepresented here however - Van Halen II and Fair Warning for example - but overall this is a good collection.     From a singer standpoint, as a guy who didn't know their music, I didn't know what tracks had what vocalists, but that didn't really matter to me, but because I got an album that showcases both vocalists but not have one dedicated to each disc, I've found I like both of them equally.     The track list to me, even tho its not chronological, is ok, it seems somewhat random, but it shows their musical diversity from track to track which is impressive.     There are two week points to the album. The album starts with Eruption, the famous guitar solo, and then goes straight into three unknown and rather uninspired and very un-van halen sounding tracks, that I have never quite liked. The other week point is the end disc, with 3 live tracks, and while good, they seem just thrown on as an afterthought.    Now, this album is missing some core album tracks, but if hits packages didn't, then you wouldn't have any good tracks waiting for you when you go out to buy the albums, which is what I ended up doing, and I still believe that despite its flaws, this compilation shows van halen at their best, its all the average listener will want, maybe more, and there is still some great music to be discovered from the albums if peopledecide to look more extensively into their catalogue like I did.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm a true fan!<br /><br />I watched for Free Online when it first came out, I watched it at a friends when the downloaded them from iTunes, and I rented the DVD to show it to friends. It was the DVD that hooked me. I had to own this DVD because of 'Commentary the Musical'. In fact, when I hear someone saw it online and liked it, I tell them about 'Commentary the Musical' and even take it to parties just to show the brilliance of that alternate track.<br /><br />The normal commentary is full of interesting facts, but 'Commentary the Musical' is like watching a whole second movie all by self. This DVD is truly a must own for any Dr. Horrible, Nathan, Neil, Felecia, or Joss Whedon fan. Even more so for a fan of any and all of the above combined.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Short and sweet, Accept are one of the great metal bands of all time, and this album is right on par with the best albums they ever released. Mark Tornillo is the best replacement for Udo you could have. His voice works for what the band does. Accept went and simply made an Accept album. They tried for 2 or 3 albums to either change direction and/or fit into what was the music of the time. It wasn't them. This is. Gotta love it!!!
0312427999|5.0|The Sundance Channel recently aired (11/2010) a documentary film of the same title based on Naomi Klein's book.  The film did something the book cannot do:  It included video of world events that relate directly to her thesis.  This book and the documentary are among the most important sources of information that explain what is going on both at home an abroad.  If I had a child fighting in a foreign war, this information would make me physically ill.  As it is, I am outraged enough to wonder how it is that Milton Friedman's theories are still in practice anywhere.  The only way this can end is in revoltion.  My father once told me that Americans would never revolt so long as they were fat and happy.  How much more \\"shock\\" therapy will it take, I wonder, before we no longer have a middle class and all wealth has become corporate property?  This should be required reading for anyone who is literate; however, at the rate of success Friedman's theories are impacting public institutions like education, I also wonder how long we will have any literate poor?  We have people who believe Friedman's economic theories installed in all the important governmental places--so we will continue to see the shock doctine in action.  Obama did nothing to \\"change\\" the root cause of all of our problems, but has continued to subscribe to this idiotic theory.  I, for one, have one scene from the documentary forever emblazoned in my mind:  In interviewing an Iraqi citizen who has just been through our \\"Shock and Awe\\" and Blackwater military treatment, he miserably states:  \\"America is the terrorist.\\"
B002ZG981E|5.0|Cobb is sort of a spy.  He goes into your dreams and extracts important information.  But now, he and his team have been hired for a different kind of job: placing an idea within a person's head.  Inception.  Can it even be done?  Has Cobb done it before?  And what are the consequences of such a difficult action?<br /><br />It caused quite a stir, as pretty much any Chris Nolan film is bound to do nowadays (you can't direct the best superhero movie of all time and not expect people to riot over your work).  INCEPTION doesn't live up to all of the hype...but it lives up to most of it. (And it's better on the second viewing, too. the first time I saw it in theaters, I was mildly impressed.  The second time, I was awed.)  Leo DiCaprio turns in another rock-solid performance; not his best, but a deep and complex turn for him.  Ellen Page is so-so; she's done better, but her presence alone adds an extra bit of umpf to the film.  Marion Cotillard is truly sexy AND scary (a rare combination for an actress to pull off); Tom Hardy shines; Tom Berenger is just there, but we like him there, so it's okay; Cillian Murphy is great as always.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the standout of the cast; he's slick and funny, and one has to wonder how it would've been if he'd been cast as Cobb (not that DiCaprio isn't great).  Nolan's script and directing are top-notch; there are some logical flaws, but surprisingly nothing that brings the movie down too much.  And the special effects are breathtaking; I've rarely seen a movie this beautifully macabre that did so well at the Box Office.<br /><br />INCEPTION isn't quite the masterpiece it's been hailed as; it has its flaws, and some of the acting isn't quite up to snuff.  But that doesn't mean it isn't great; it is truly one of the best science fiction films of recent years.  INCEPTION is a movie that inspires both visual awe and deeper thought.  It won't please everyone, but to those who like their blockbusters with something more than just explosions and one-liners, it's truly a movie to watch again and again.e-liners, it's truly a movie to watch again and again.
1582701709|1.0|Heard a lot about this book, and good reviews. I was excited to read it, but half way through the book it just lost my interest. I dont believe in asking the universe for stuff you need and want. It just sounds like a big hoax to me. Im big on faith and religion so maybe thats why
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This review is based on the show itself. My review on the dvd will come when its released which I just pre ordered..    The show of course based off the hit graphic novel by Robert Kirkman and it follows Officer Rick Grimes after he wakes up from a comoa to find out that zombies have taken over and now he must he find his wife and son.    The show does a great job adapting the comic to the small screen. Adding some new storylines and characters, as well as changing the fates of some to add new conflicts to the fold. You still have most of the major characters. What makes the show really good for those who read the comics (which I have), they have new characters. So at times I dont know the fate  of them. Will they live, will they die..if so when and how.     They did however leave out to me 4 characters (a husband and wife with their 2 young twin sons however the character of Carol seems to be a mixture of her character in the comics along with the wife mentioned). I didnt really care for the redneck brothers who arent in the comic, but not knowing their fate leaves me intrigued.    This show does what so few comics have done, made an adaption that works. I hate that season 2 wont start till Oct. of 2011 but I will have the dvd in March to keep me entertained till then. Expect my review of the dvd when it hits stores in March.
B003INBNXO|1.0|I had very hard time watching this DVD, actually fast forwarded most of the movie as it was so annoying.  The martial art fights are good, but they tend to have the same moves over and over. The directing and photographing is really bad and the storyline is the same as most of the Chinese martial art movies.  The English language translation has so little emotion that it almost hurts my ears.    If you are a fan of  Jet Li's Fearless or the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon movie which has a magical beauty to it you will be very unsatisfied. I can't believe I paid for this....    The movie reminds me of the 80s where every military action movies was about the Soviet Union and USA. This time it is China vs. Japan in a extremely boring story line. The actors' play is worse that any Latin Soap opera.

0316098337|5.0|I finished ROOM a couple of days ago, and I can't stop thinking about it. Without giving away plot details, it has made me rethink some of my ideas on child-rearing. I've also reflected at length on how unimportant \\"things\\" are when it comes to happiness. Not that these ideas are new, but Emma Donoghue has done an amazing job of underlining these themes with humor and sensitivity. Having 5-year old Jack serve as narrator was a stroke of genius. I LOVED this novel!!

B00428ZRFE|5.0|I gotta say that when I started reading the reviews I was a little afraid of purchasing this album. I absolutely loved Rated R and I didn't want to be disappointed but I couldn't hold on anymore and went ahead and purchased it anyway. I am EXTREMELY glad I ordered this album. It is awesome. I do like Rated R better but not by a whole lot =). Rihanna did a GREAT job on this CD. I say buy it, you won't be sorry!

B003DZX44I|4.0|My second favorite Disney movie ever (after \\"The Little Mermaid\\"), \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" has been a favorite of mine since I saw it in theaters in 1991 and later when I bought the VHS in 1992. It's simply a captivating motion picture: from the striking opening shot of a castle deep in the woods, you are riveted to the screen until the closing shot of a stained glass. The songs are some of the best by Disney, particularly \\"Belle\\" and \\"Something There\\" (I don't like the newly-added \\"Human Again\\"). The musical score is fittingly haunting and rich, most effective in the prologue, the west wing and the transformation sequences. While Alan Menken's best songs are probably those in \\"Mermaid\\", the score here is arguably his best.     Now, on to this release. Ever since it's 2002 DVD debut, there has been quite a controversy over the restoration the film has gone through. And indeed, anyone even slightly familiar with the original release, easily noticed the difference in colors. Whereas the early 90's version boasted a gothic and dark picture, the 2002 DVD showed a flat and cheap-looking picture with bright and off colors (for example, \\"olive green\\" turned to neon green). I don't know what the directors were trying to achieve by doing that, maybe experience their classic in a Saturday Morning cartoon style? So imagine how eager Disneyphiles were for the new release, firmly believing they'll nail it this time and that the Diamond Edition would look more like the 1991 film than the 2002 one.     So after seeing the new transfer, I can say it's better than the previous release, but still disappointing as it looks nothing like the original. Again, Belle's hair is light brown instead of dark, the ballroom is too yellowish, even the stars in the ballroom sequence don't sparkle as they do in the original. These flaws may look minor to casual viewers but it's irritating to fans of the film.     So even though it is a brilliant film, I was disappointed to some degree by its restoration and I wish the directors would finally take notice. As for me, I'm keeping my 1992 VHS tape to enjoy what was ORIGINALLY \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".
0061537969|1.0|One might think this is more of a man's book because of all the racing references and the perspective of a man through most of the book, but it is a beautiful, thoughtful, emotional love story of a father fighting for his daughter.  Enzo's eyes see the world and everyone in it as his personal duties to protect.  Of course I cried and laughed and rejoiced with each of the characters.  This was a book I had bought just to complete an order of three books and it really was a piece of gold amongst the myriad of \\"rocks\\" one ususally pans.

But, as the book progressed, I got over it. As did Westcliff and Lillian. Evie handled him well and St. Vincent did go on to redeem himself. I simply adored this story. I highly recommend this book, start from the beginning of the series though. If you haven't looked into The Hathaways read them as well.

Like another review said you must watch it with an open mind.  Also this can not be the first Bollywood movie you watch.  I loved it!!!  I must say that the start of the movie was kind of slow but when Khan starts telling you the story it gets you hooked.

031603438X|3.0|I hope this book is sold as fiction. This as about as self-serving a book as has ever been penned. Keith, the hero, the misunderstood good guy, the person totally responsible for the Stones success. Baloney!   This is a book (supposedly) written by a man whose brain synapses have been deep fried by every drug combination known to man, countless times. This is Keith's version of the truth. As we all know there are a minimum of two sides to the truth, and the real truth lies somewhere in the center. If we're to believe Keith's version the sun truly does rise out of his arse every morning.   The is just another book written by a shallow, self-serving Rock and Roll (strictly Blues, in Keith's opinion) icon whose memory may be a bit too drug frayed and alcohol soaked to be marginally believable.  In short, don't waste your money. Wait for the movie, undoubtedly with Johnny Depp as Richards.
B003UYUR10|1.0|I watched the movie last night. Its as if the scenes were based on long-standing Hollywood movies that we all know, so it was very predictable, killed most of the drama. The scenes were just stuck together like pearl beads on a string. No flow, just assumptions that the audience caught the new plot direction without it actually being developed properly in the script. Special effects were poor, not convincing enough, and too few.     The Princess falls in love with the bastard Prince of Persia, but its unclear exactly when or why - she just kind of does. I wouldn't recommend this even as a young kid's movie. Definitely won't be any sequels, its just that bad. Don't waste your recession dollars on this Blu-Ray/DVD stinker.     Sorry Disney, some people who currently have jobs and produced this stinker need to pray they don't receive pink slips and perhaps you should look for some real talent that already is collecting unemployment that used to make really great movies for you. Kingsley is superb, but limited by the script, Jake is great, the Princess is NOT a raven beauty as the film suggests... the top-shelf actors were subjected to and forced to work with a rotten screenplay, poor directing, poor editing, and poor special effects. Poor me for buying the movie, I knew I should have opted for the Scorceror's Apprentice instead - it may have stunk too, but at least I would have felt better about the $$$.
0439023513|5.0|I've read the first two books three times before i got to this one, and even though it wasn't as intense or action packed as the first two, i think it provides a great roller coaster ride of excitement and a great resolution
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Very rarely does a film come along that is claimed to be better than the book, especially by me, one of those cynical-book-reading-types that always has to point out that the Book was way better. I think Big Fish is one of the few instances where this is not true. The Book is good, don't get me wrong, but I believe that Tim Burton did an amazing job bringing the book to life. The story was consistent the entire way through, no important parts missing that people who don't read books completely miss out on, and it's visually stunning. The actors cast fit their characters flawlessly. Watching the film felt like what my imagination would have created for the visuals while reading. I always recommend to people to read the book, it's better. However, in this case, I'd say watch the movie first. It's beautiful.
0439023513|5.0|This series is as prefect as it get! I can not believe how many people gave this book a bad rating, just because they wanted a Disney, happily ever after ending. I think the ending is perfect, unpredictable, and Katiness is very in character. I glad Ms Collins did not chesse it up at the end, this is not the tone to Katiness and Peeta's relationship. My favorite book of 2010. \\"Not Real or Real?\\" \\"Real\\".
B0041EVYVK|3.0|This Album does not sound as good as the Live videos on YouTube and on the band's own website. Just much more muted emotionally less punchy. Even the vocals were toned down.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|Songs From The Road is a delight in every way. I've been a Cohen fan since seeing him in Austin when he taped an Austin City Limits show in the 80's. But never before the recordings from his  current world tour have I so enjoyed instrumental solos as much as I enjoy these.    In addition to being an outstanding singer/songwriter/poet/entertainer, Cohen assembled world-class musicians who help to make these recordings an exceptional pleasure. I'm partial to the sax performances by Dino Soldo, but my musician husband rhapsodizes over guitarist Bob Metzger and bassist/music director Roscoe Beck.  Everybody on the stage for these performances is excellent.    Songs From the Road makes me happy every time I play either the DVD or the CD. It's a joy just to know these recordings exist.
0805091742|4.0|It's not immediately clear how checklists can help every profession, but Gawande lays out some thought-provoking scenarios that have me thinking about checklists in my own profession and personal life. Good, fast read, all meat no fat. Not familiar with this author before, but the forward is by Malcolm Gladwell and this author's style reminds me of Gladwell. If you like Gladwell, you'll like Gawande. If you are a New Yorker subscriber, you most likely already know of them both.
B001J53X9U|4.0|Worth every penny spent on this. The Film is great and the Batpod is such a cool edition boxset, a must for all collectors out there.
0756405890|5.0|This has certainly become one of my favorite books. It's funny, engaging, dramatic and interesting.   It's not like most fantasy books though. If you are just looking for another generic fantasy where a group of friends go off to fight some generic unambiguous evil then this is not a book for you, this is a much better book. I've purchased no fewer than 3 copies of this book to give to various people, 2 of which aren't fantasy fans at all. Every one of them has loved this book.   So now I recommend this book to whom ever decides to read this. The book itself may be slow to get into, but remember this is a trilogy told as one story. The beginning is making a very solid foundation for the rest of the book and the two books to come.
1416594795|5.0|Dawkins has described in great detail the discoveries made after Darwin's time, which provide evidence to the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin was born in 1809 and published his most important work \\"Origin of Species\\" in 1859. Along the way, Dawkins also answers the critics of evolution.     Dawkins gives examples of three kinds of evolution. First is the case of artificial selection where humans deliberately choose attractive roses, sunflowers etc. for breeding, thereby preserving the genes that produce the attractive features. Second is sexual selection where peahens choose attractive peacocks for breeding, thereby preserving attractive genes. The last one is the case of natural selection where random mutations in genes lead to the survival of the fittest. The evolution of dog from a wolf, was a combination of natural and artificial selections.     Darwin's work was not based on genes, while Gregor Mendel's work was. Although Darwin and Mendel were contemporaries, Darwin did not read Mendel's work because it was in German. Darwin's work was largely based on evolution thru natural selection, while Mendel's work was based on artificial selection.     Dawkins talks about how rocks and fossils are dated, using a radioactive clock based on potassium-40 which has a half life of 1.26 billion years. The fossils tell a great story on the timeline of evolution.     Dawkins describes an experiment done by Richard Lenski, where e-coli were placed in different flasks containing glucose and citrate. Normally e-coli can make use of glucose, but not citrate. As e-coli population increased, the levels of glucose fell. Then the population decreased. A stunning incident took place. A random mutation occurred in one of the flasks, because of which e-coli started using citrate. This increased the population of e-coli in this flask, regardless of the lower levels of glucose. This experiment demonstrated evolution at work.    Another experiment performed by John Endler involved evolution of guppies in ponds. In ponds where there were no predators, fine gravel favored development of coarse spots in a few generations, so that the guppies could attract females. If the gravel was coarse instead, fine spots appeared for the same purpose. In presence of predators, however, the spots evolved in exactly the opposite manner because camouflaging from predators became important than attracting mates. Thus, contrasting or merging of body colors and spots, against the background, evolved depending on the presence of predators.     Dawkins talks about how geographically separated gene pool of the same species will eventually drift apart from one another, to the point where they evolve into different species. The cichlid faunas of Lake Victoria, Lake Tanganyika, Lake Malawi, each several hundred species strong, are completely distinct from each other. This tells us what evolution can do with geographical separation in a short space of time. The plate tectonics have caused vast geological changes on the earth. In fact, the geological changes described in great detail by Charles Lyell, sowed the seeds of evolution in Darwin's mind. Without plate tectonics, one cannot understand the distribution of animals and plants over the continents and islands of the world.      One criticism of evolution is if humans evolved from apes, why don't apes give birth to humans. Dawkins rightly points out that by and large, members of a specie breed amongst themselves and members across species do not. Also, modern species do not evolve into other modern species. They just share a common ancestor: they are cousins.    Another criticism against evolution is that of the missing link. Dawkins states that there will always be a missing link. As more fossils are found and laid on the timeline of evolution, there will always be gaps because this is like an investigation of evidence after the crime has taken place. Because one cannot reconstruct the whole timeline, generation by generation. But, we have enough discoveries to trace back the evolution of Homo Sapiens to Homo erectus to Homo habilis, with the evolution marked by increasing brain sizes.    Dawkins gives an example of how evolution resulted in a long detour of the laryngeal nerve down the giraffe's neck and which looped back up again. This happened because of incremental changes thru evolution, rather than going back to the drawing board and starting a new design from scratch, like what an intelligent designer would have done.  Similarly, the vas deferens in mammals is hooked the wrong way over the ureter, resulting from incremental changes and not from a brand new intelligent design.    Dawkins gives some insights into how a complex organism like a human baby evolves from a few cells. Something like an \\"inflating origami\\". Following the principles of Epigenesis in which the development of an organism occurs by progressive differentiation of an initially undifferentiated whole. Roger Sperry came up with \\"chemo-affinity\\" hypothesis, according to which the nervous system wires itself up not by following an overall blueprint but by each individual axon seeking out end organs with which it has a particular affinity. That is small local units following local rules, rather than a master builder guiding the whole process.    Dawkins mentions that the final evidence for all the creatures originating from a common ancestor is that all life on earth is based on the concepts of self replication and gene/protein synthesis. Which provides a molecular basis for evolution. Self-replication spawns a population of entities, which compete with each other to be replicated. Since no copying process is perfect, the population will inevitably come to contain variety. The fittest of the variety will survive, because the weaker one's have more chances of perishing, thus leading to natural selection. Enzymes are basically proteins which speed up the biological reactions inside the living organisms. The combination of the best replicating molecule, the DNA, and the best enzymes, the proteins, have made life possible. In the beginning, when life was very simple, the RNA molecule did both the jobs. As life became complex, the DNA and Enzymes came to play specialized roles to speed up evolution.    Finally, the detailed explanation of how complex organisms form from so simple a beginning, is still a work in progress. How the self replicating mechanism gets triggered, is not understood well. Evolutionists do not claim that they are omniscient. But the fact is that they have come long way since such a simple but profound beginning made by Darwin.

030726999X|2.0|Oh, man, what a letdown from the flashbang ending of the second book! This was not what I was hoping for.<br /><br />The biggest problem: there's no mystery.<br /><br />If you found the unrealistic conclusion of the previous installment hard to believe, cheer up: this one is just like real life--a bunch of people you don't know or care about sit around in meetings talking about stuff that's already happened. Lots of things almost happen, though.<br /><br />The Girl Who Played with Fire ended in a crescendo of action and resolution, but this book spent 540 pages carrying out the inevitable and who-cares legal resolution of the crimes detailed in the second book. Remember when, in book two, Bj&ouml;rck described the remaining bad guys? Well, in this book, the author tells us who they are right at the outset. No mystery there. The damage had been done. Most of the hornets were dead or dying. No need to kick nests.<br /><br />With the exception of some excitement in Chapter 7 and a close call in Chapter 24, just about nothing happens until the epilogue, which was by far the best part of the book.<br /><br />And to you who already read the book: did you notice how Mr. Larsson keeps trying to convince us that the story is, like, really important? It could be the most important thing ever to happen in Sweden!<br /><br />And did you notice how often Swedes eat sandwiches? I had no idea they liked them so much.<br /><br />Lastly (and on a slightly more serious note): I don't mean to be a kvinnor-hater, but did you notice that every woman in the Millenium trilogy is faultless? With the exception of Harriet's mother in The Dragon Tattoo, it seems that every other female character is just a wonderful person. None of them are ever greedy, insincere or spiteful, just misunderstood at worst. Sorry, Mr. Larsson, but women are humans, too.<br /><br />Not recommended. Skip to the epilogue and use the time you saved on a better book.
0385737955|5.0|Adults, listen up!<br />This book was not written for you!<br />It was written for a younger male audience, so if you're expecting a writing style or level of difficulty that is more where you're at then you are going to be disappointed. And your criticism of such things is just irrelevant.<br />I have been a loyal fan of the Young Adult genre and have to say, in my opinion, this is one of the better series out there. Not simply for the story, which is simply creative genius, but the author is a very good writer. Read it for yourself and decide for yourself.<br />I don't agree that the beginning was slow. I was hooked from the first page! In fact the author has great skill in hooking the reader and reeling him in. Most of the chapters end in cliff hangers, a creative if not a somewhat redundant way to get the child to pick the book back up after he's laid it down. Ya, I have come to expect a twist or something breath taking to happen at the end of a chapter but look at it this way...how many chapters are there and how many interest grabbing events have to happen at the end of each chapter to reel you back in? Loads right?? This book is non stop sometimes heart pounding action!<br />But it does not stand alone, so beware! If you want to know the answers to all the questions raised in the book, you are going to have to commit to the whole series. Honestly, I should not have started this series until it was finished. My only regret.

156224003X|4.0|very helpful ideas and yoga practices.  however, he must have mentioned that the relaxation exercises and meditation processes are directly taken from yoga. I was expecting more classical piano emphasis, but overall, there are many ideas that classical pianists can use as well.  I would have one criticism to the main idea in the book: that of letting your fingers doing the playing and the mind enjoying the music from the space above... this is very dangerous for classical piano. that was how I used to play when I was an adolescent and suffered great mishaps in concerts when the mind kept coming back and forth.. of course he means being completely well rehearsed in order to have the mind float above, but still classical piano requires constant control  ... AND being able to enjoy it simultaneously. The enjoyment comes by itself anyhow when one has complete control and has internalized the music.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Annie Lennox has never been on my most favorite list, so when I saw the album I hesitated..  I finally bought it and after listening to it more than once, I am in love with it!  The harmonies, and the way she has put together arrangements in a not so traditional fashion, make the album very rich, and the songs fresh and new..  If you are in doubt, just buy it.. its worth it for sure!!
B00004WEJZ|5.0|This is 1 of the best James Bond Films ever, I loved it. I have been a Bond fan 4 a long time and no one did it like Sean Connery could, he was the best.<br /><br />Thank U,<br />Kris L. CocKayne
B0000669JL|5.0|This new remastered version of Legend by Bob Marley has a great like 28 page front booklet and 2 bonus tracks. Love that \\"easy skanking\\" song and the \\"punk reggae party\\" tune also isnt too bad. Im not a big reggae fan but Bob Marley is it's godfather. The other songs without a doubt are classics and put Marley at the legend statis for this genre of music. Go buy this CD just if you like music. You wont be disappointed.
0811876373|3.0|While the idea is great & how the cake pops are decorated is very nice. The recipe itself is a very soft cake, not something normal people like. You don't expect it to be so soft. I'll try to work on the cake part to make it not so soft  & see if that will make it better. Too bad....
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Remember hearing \\"Unchained\\" on the radio like a million times in '81 and I was like who is this? This song ROCKS!! However,in addition \\"Mean Street\\", \\"Dirty Movies\\" and the other tracks make this a great album to listen to LOUD! Michael Anthony's bass comes through very clearly on the songs but Eddie's guitar work is undeniable. Fair Warning is another DLR Van Halen favorite!
B002ZG981E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot. I am a casual movie goer, I don't have a degree in film watching like some people seem to these days.  I had fun watching this movie in the theater, and wanted to see it again right after it was over. This rarely happens for me, so there you have it!
B000002LPD|2.0|This album F or  U nlawful C arnal K nowledge is the worst Van Halen next to VH3. \\"Right Now\\" is the only descent song on it and thats not because they play it on the radio all the time! They tryed to rock harder but it just doesnt do it for me. Hagar has ruined this band. PeeUUU!!!!
0307591549|5.0|Absolutely brilliant. I know that I'm going to remember the things that I've read in this book for years to come. This is a must read for anyone interested in improving their life and success at home and at work.
B00008BXJG|4.0|This isnt my favorite AC/DC album but with the title track, Shot down in flames, and Night prowler it aint that bad. The last with the late great Bon Scott...yes RIP...it is a great sounding album from start to finish. I still highly recommend it for any fan!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|It ranks #1 and I am a huge masterpiece theater  fan. I loved it.. it's a must. Richard Armitage was beyond perfect. If only the studio's would  start producing Georgette Heyer's books I would be a happy Camper ..Imagine Richard Armitage as Vidal!
B00004Y6OA|5.0|I love all the DLR Van Halen CDs and own each one. Songs like \\"and the cradle will rock\\", \\"Everybody wants some!!\\" and \\"Take your whiskey home\\"(not sure that is a good idea Dave)highlight Women and Children First. This is one of VH's best! I also recommend VH 1&2 along with FAir warning, Diver Down...not their strongest thou',and 1984. The remastering job is quite good and the songs sound great!
B003NFM3JK|2.0|The animation is great...however for younger children this movie is hard to understand.  Some parts of the story were quite scary and I don't know why they had to go so far as to have the ghost of Jacob Marley's jaw break apart and what's with the ghost of Christmas present and those scary looking horses?  I was hoping for a Christmas movie that we would want to watch over and over again, unfortunately we watched it once and now it's collecting dust.  Again this is totally my opinion, someone else might love this movie.  My 3 (out of 5) children watched it, their ages are 10, 5 and 4.  My ten year old son had a lot of questions, things didn't make sense like the scene with the 2 nasty looking children that hang around the feet of one of the ghosts.  So just be prepared, I was even scratching my head thinking, \\"what..\\"  Hope this review helps you, have a Merry Christmas.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|The debut Van Halen album in one word....ROCKS from the first track to the last track. It introduced us to a guy whose guitar playing was unlike any heard in the late 70's. Not to repeat what others might have said but this CD probably saved hard rock as it was way back then for you kiddies not yet even born. So if you dont own this one, you should pick up a copy and listen to it...then repeat again.  AT LOUD VOLUMES!!!
B001UV4XFQ|2.0|First off, I pre-ordered this movie for my wife and I recieved the movie two days after its dvd release date. As an Amazon prime member I'm guaranteed to have this movie on its day of release, instead she had to wait while everybody else was running down the street to Wal-Mart and getting it Saturday morning. My biggest complaint though is the packaging of the Special Edition Blu-ray and Dvd combo!! They actually want to charge upwards to $30.00 for a single disc release that contains the blu-ray on one side and the dvd on the other! I and others find this completely unacceptable and just another way cheapen their product while cheating the consumers!! Also, for a blu-ray that costs around $30.00 where's the freaking digital copy?
B000002LEM|4.0|Ou812 was musically a very good album with some poppy songs but like I noticed and alot of other reviewers noticed....where's the bass? Did Michael Anthony drop out for this one hoping that David Lee Roth would come back? Or did Eddie, Alex, and Sammy just turn down the bass volume on this one? Whatever, its ok and my highest rated VH album w/Hagar. So if u like Sammy...I would go out and buy it. Really I would. NOT!!!
4770031246|5.0|I've barely made any of the recipes in this book, but I'm already happy I bought it; it's exactly what I was looking for in a book about bento. I was not looking for a book to teach me how to spend hours making cute manga charaben lunches for kids (though I appreciate the artistry), I wasn't looking for a book to suggest ridiculously, inaccessibly gourmet dishes, or dishes with ingredients I can't easily find...I was looking for a book that had quick, healthy, balanced, tasty meal suggestions, with some Japanese influence, but with non-Japanese dishes as well.<br /><br />This is it.<br /><br />It has great tips about what kind of food to look for for a particular dish, which parts to make when, planning ahead, food safety, which parts are optional, and little details that many cookbooks seem to assume you may know, without getting all fussy (the explanations about how to make good, basic white rice were great). The photographs are nicely done, though I do wish more of them were in color (I know, color printing is expensive), but the presentations were simple, elegant and visually appealing, the format of the book is easy to parse, and the glossary of Japanese ingredients she mentions in recipes is helpful.<br /><br />The one gripe I have (and it's certainly not enough to deduct a star) is that some of the ingredients use weight instead of volume measurements--most people use cups and tablespoons where she suggests grams. I've checked out several bento books from the library, and while some had useful suggestions, I wouldn't bother owning any--I'm glad I own this one, I'll be gleefully trying most of these recipes.
B00008WT5E|5.0|This is a great album. The first 6 tracks are the meat and potatoes of the CD like the standouts \\"Down Payment Blues\\", \\"Riff Raff\\", the radio popular vegas tune \\"Sin City\\", and \\"Whats next to the Moon\\". I like this more than most AC/DC critics because I feel it was a great precursor to what was to come next. If your a fan go out and buy Powerage....NOW!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when I saw the previews for this show prior to Halloween (2010).  I was blown away and hooked after the very first episode!  It was so well done, realistic and the acting was stellar!  The zombies and special effects were awesome and the gore was where it should be.  What impressed me was how the show captured the true emotions of people in the unique circumstances that these characters were thrown into.  You could identify with the characters and what they were feeling.  I also liked the rollercoaster of emotions that you felt for certain characters.  At first, you can't stand certain people, then you like them, then you loath them and later they do not seem that bad...  I began telling all of my friends about this program and they loved it too.  Being from Atlanta, it was also interesting to see all the locations that I could recognize.  In my opinion, the series began to lose a tiny bit of steam around the \\"Vatos\\" episode.  You have to watch to see what I mean.  The CGI could also be improved and may as the budget increases.  The CGI for the zombie headshots was fine, but the explosions were pretty bad.  For example, the grenade in the last episode was pretty weak and the final explosion of the building was laughable (Will not be specific so that I do not spoil anything).  These are picky little details that can be ignored.  This is a 5 star show and I will buy this season for sure!  There were a lot of loose ends at the end of the first season that I wanted to see, at least touched upon.  For instance, what happened to the black father and son who helped the main character?  I really liked those folks and wanted to see more of them.  What happened to the racist jerk from the roof?  Normally I would not care since you have to assume that they will be in season 2.  Unfortunately, there are rumors that Frank Darabont may drop the official writing staff and pursue freelance writers instead.  This would be a horrible idea since it would kill the continuity of the story and characters (If every episode was done by a different writer).  Watch the movie \\"The Signal\\", which was also filmed in Atlanta and you will see what can happen when you do this kind of thing.  This show is a gem and I really hope that they do not ruin it!  If you have not seen it, watch it and you will not be disappointed!
B000002L99|3.0|5150 contains songs that on the listening point of view sound good but then u bring in Hagar and then you tell yourself..oh man this is NOW Van Halen. Doesnt sound like 'em with him on vocals as opposed to Roth singing. NOt saying that Hagar is a bad singer..hes good. But, i dont think he was ever a good fit with VH. None of the Van Hagar CD's ever did as well as when Roth was the vocalist. Just a fact to throw out there. I would steer clear of these so called \\"Van Halen\\" recordings...w/Hagar.
1439163146|5.0|At first I didn't know what to expect because I hadn't heard anything on what the book was about. What intrigued me, the reason I bought it, was because I was interested in James Franco as a writer.  I had no idea that the book was split into sections, and that the stories were told in first-person by those whose stories they were. All of the stories were of young teens living in Palo Alto, and each story was beautifully and simply written, and moving.  It made me want to know these teenagers personally. I loved everything and every second of reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone.  But it is a quick read, you may finish faster than you'd expect, which is unfortunate because after you start reading you won't want to stop.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|Now I know alot of Police fans wish that \\"When The World Is Running Down, You Make The Best Of What's Still Around\\" was on the 2CD set but with the long title,maybe it just wouldnt fit. Anyway, this is a good compilation of songs and a must for any younger generation that wants to get a taste of one of the best rock bands to come out of the late 70's & early 80's. Being I had a couple of their albums on cassette, I had to get this knowing the best of the best were on them without having to buy all their albums on CD.
B003274QH6|5.0|I watched the main actor (Bryan Cranston) win an Emmy, so I thought I would watch the first episode of the show just to see if it intrigued me. I had no clue what the show was about or what to expect. It turned out to be the best series I've watched on television (previously was 24-mainly the first couple of seasons). The acting is far beyond any tv and even most movies. Aaron Paul has improved immensely since season 1. Bryan Cranston has won the Emmy for best actor every single year since the show started-that speaks for itself in my opinion, and then Dean Norris-wow, he came out of nowhere and just blew me away. He has some amazing scenes in seasons 2 & 3 that he just blew me away in. The show is raw, gory, and brutal, but it's also all honest without being preachy. I have finished all 3 seasons and can't wait for July '11 when it comes back on air. I've shared the show with 6 other people and all have became huge fans. AMC has really got an amazing lineup with this, Mad Men, and their new Walking Dead show. The blu-ray is great and worth the couple dollars more than the DVD set, looks great in a lot of the outdoor scenes.
B000002MUQ|1.0|What was Van halen thinking when they put this one together? The songs are just this....GARBAGE! They try and rock out but make a very uneven and [...] recording. The CD just doesnt flow and w/Sammy Van Hagar on vocals it just makes things worse. 2 thumbs way down!! Come back Dave we miss you.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I love this show!  I am so disappointed it was not picked up for a third season.  The acting was much better than I thought for a fantasy series.  I will miss these characters.
B000002WYT|4.0|In the interest of full disclosure, I've never been a big fan of Matthews' voice, and that remains an issue with me.  That said, his band is terrific, and goes a long way towards overcoming that weakness.  \\"So Much to Say\\" is a great opener with its funky beat and a tight horn arrangement.  \\"Two Step\\" is pretty good, too.  I was less impressed by \\"Crash Into Me\\" which is I guess is supposed to be quiet and tender, but winds up kind of a sleeper.  \\"Too Much\\" is my personal favorite; Matthews sings with real power and the band gets funky like a monkey.  \\"#41\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\" are just okay, although the latter opens with a nice jam for flute and percussion.  \\"Drive In, Drive Out\\" has a memorable chorus (often a problem with Dave's writing) but the rest of the song doesn't hang together very well.  \\"Let You Down\\" is another piece that strives for intimacy and warmth, but I'm just not feeling it.  \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" has a nice bouncy beat, and some fine instrumental solos - good stuff.  \\"Cry Freedom\\" is yet another ballad.  \\"Tripping Billies\\" features some country-style fiddle-playing that kind of dominates the song, but it really rocks, too.  \\"Proudest Monkey\\" has a cool sax solo but it wasn't enough to save this 9 minute plus track.  I really enjoyed this CD despite some weak tracks.  Fans of Matthews' voice should add another star to my rating.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Everybody knows Nicki Minaj one of the hottest rappers around these days.    Notice I said \\"hottest\\" and not \\"best.\\"    Don't get me wrong, Nicki can rhyme without a doubt, but this effort is subpar at best. Nicki seems to be nice enough for a verse on your album, but she CANNOT CARRY AN ENTIRE ALBUM! Trust me on this folks. Nicki can absolutely destroy a verse on a posse cut, or a quick sixteen bars on an R&B song but Nicki's voice is unbearable over the span of an album. And the album is essentially song after song of \\"I'm the best, I'm the best, I'm the best.\\" Gimme a break. If you're a die-hard Minaj fan, my review won't matter, you probably own it already. If you're considering purchasing the album, don't.
B000M53GM2|5.0|After 6 years a new Bond film came out now with Pierce Brosnan in the role of 007 directed by Martin Campbell he directed Casino Royale which is an ok James Bond movie & Edge of Darkness. This is probably his best movie. It stars Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, Sean Bean as Alec Trevelyan Judi Dench as the new M Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp Izabella Scorpio asa Natalya Simonova, Alan Cumming as Boris Grishinko Gottfried John as Ourumov Robbie Coltrane as Valentin Dimitrovich Zukovsky Desmond Llewlyn as Q & Joe Don Baker as Jack Wade. Story is James Bond & Alec Trevelyn 006 are on a mission at this Chemical Factory in Arkanglsk Russia. Bond's setting the explosives Trevelyan is held at gun point & shot in the head dead by Colonel Arkady Ourmov. Bond escapes from the plant & the gas plant blows up we get the opening theme by Tina Turner Golden Eye. 9 Years later James Bond is in Monte Carlo he runs into Janus Crime syndicate member Xenia Onatopp. The Janus groups plan is to steal a key card called Golden Eye. Well Xenia takes this Adniral & ph uc k s him to death & her & Ourmov who is now a General take steal the tiger helicopter cause it's EMP proof Bond attempts to stop them but is stoopped by security or whatever. Ourmov & Xenia go to Severnaya to steal the Golden Eye key card Xenia massacures the staff it's pretty brutal they set 1 of the Satallites to destory the complex they leave with genius programer Boris Grishenko who works for the Janus group. 1 other programmer survived Natalya Simonva a level 2 programmer Natalya makes her way to ST Petersburg Russia where she's eventually captured by Xenia & Boris. Bond heads to ST Petersburg & meets his contact there Jack Wade from the CIA in a real entertaining scene he points him to Janus's competition Valentine Zukovsky who Bond has a history with. Zukovsky tells him that Janus is a Leinz Cossack who wants revenge on The British Government at any cost Zukovsky sets up a meeting with with Janus. There Janus revels himself as MI6 agent Alec Trevelyan his face is scarred from the blast 9 years ago. Bond is about to shoot him he gets hit with a dart. Bond narrowly escapes the tiger helicopter with Natalya. He & Natalya are taken to a military complex by Russian Defense Minister Dimitri Miskin. Natalys tells Miskin that General Ourmov's involment in the Golden Eye theft. Ourmov comes in kills Miskin Bond & Natalya escape she's captured Bond follows Ourmov in a Tank which is an entertaining well done scene that took 4 weeks to film. He follows Ourmov to a train where Trevelyan & Xenia are on board. Bond stops the train with the Tank he goes in & kills Ourmov but Trevelyan & Xenia escape Trevelyan put a self destruct timmer on the train Natalya finds out there base is in Cuba. They go to Cuba to go after Trevelyan while flying over the jungle the plane is shot down they survive & Xenia was sent in to finish the job Bond overcomes it shoots the helicopter Xenia is crushed against the tree which leads to a line I like a lot \\"You know she always did enjoy a good squeeze.\\" The make there way to Trevelyan's base basically Trevelyan is going to steal money from every bank in England then using the Golden Eye he will erase any trace of it & kill England's economy. Natalya progamed the satillite to destroy itself. Bond uses a pen gernade Q gave him & blows part of the control room up. Bond & Natalya escaspe to the surface which leads to a fight between Bond & Trevelyan Bond stops the Golden Eye by putting a rod in some machinery that's pretty much the movie. Several stuff had to be changed from the script cause it was almost identical to True Lies. This was the longest gap between Bond movies. The Rolling Stones were offered to sing the opening theme. M's real name is revealed in the script Barbra Meowurdsky. Renny Harlin was offered to direct which would've been cool. Alec Trevelyan was originally suppose to be called Augestus Trevelyan & they wanted Anthony Hopkins for the role but he turned it down as did Alan Rickman he said he was tired of playing bad guys.  Some stuff had to be cut to accquire to get a PG 13 rating. Martin Campbell did a good job directing he put a lot of action into this great energy. Pierce Brosnan was great. Sean Bean did a good job he gives good performances when he has good scripts & a capeable director to work with. Izabella Scorpio was pretty good Alan Cumming worked fine for what he had to do. Famke Janssen was did a good job as always. Gottfried John was good Robbie Coltrane didn't get a whole lot of screen time but he was good too. Judi Dench I like as M I think she's the best M. Desmond Llewlyn always entertains. I love the song at the end The Experance Of Love By Eric Serria which should've been a bigger hit. I'd rather hear The Experience Of Love than My Heart Will Go On from Titanic or the end theme from The Body Gaurd.  1 thing I have to mention is the game on the N64 you should play it & get this movie you will not be disappointed.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This is simply the funniest show on television. I had only seen one episode prior to purchasing the DVD so I really didn't know what to expect. When I cracked the case and started watching from the beginning, I was hooked FAST. This show is successful to me on so many fronts. There are tons of characters that you just can't get enough of. The situations for each of the families are unique and fresh and really, simply put, FUNNY. I also like the fact that there isn't a lot of sexuality or even references to sex. The show is very clean with only slight nods toward the adult humor that most sitcoms seem to rely on. This makes the show a great one to watch with ANY audience or age group and it also makes a great background show for parties and get togethers. I really can't get enough of the show, and there are a lot of extras on the DVD like bloopers and such for fans of the show. Go buy it today!
B00407PO2S|2.0|Hey, I'm a big fan of the series, and the first film was tolerable.  Sadly, this film isn't.  It's a succession of ever-disimproving set pieces, outlandish story lines, and over-styled (yes, that's possible, even in SATC)actresses.  Film quality is fine, and the girls are reasonably game, but they are badly let down by a ridiculous story line with zero emotional depth (which was always the bed rock of the series).  Probably no point saying 'avoid', cos all the fans will want to see it, but maybe rent rather than buy.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|I am a huge fan of James Cameron but I was beyond disappointed in this film.  It was derivative, badly-written, and (worst of all) just plain boring.  Heaven only knows why people seem to like it so much.  I can truly say I hated it with every fiber of my being!
B000641D2Y|5.0|We just ordered this movie from Amazon and, like always, it came in the mail pretty quickly. We actually just watched it last night and I was again reminded how awesome the Home Alone movies are (the first two - NOT the new ones!). This is definitely a movie that all children should see during the Christmas season. Great little lessons about friendship and compassion, and a wonderful fun little story to keep any child entertained!

B00288KNJU|5.0|Coraline is a very imaginative move, and the 2D Blu-Ray feature looks great on an HD television.    If you're buying it for the 3D version of the movie, don't.  You lose all the colors of the original, leaving a washed-out mess that doesn't have much of a 3D appearance.  I think this will be true of any movie that uses the red/blue glasses for the 3D effect.    For 3D, wait until the hardware confusion settles down, as it eventually did for Blu-Ray vs HD DVD, and then get a true 3D version.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Now maturing into young adults, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are on their own and on the run from Death Eaters as they search for the scattered pieces of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul and an ultimate weapon that will destroy it forever.    The ultimate judgment of this final installment must await the release of Part II next year, but this is a promising start.  In a series with such a large cast and such a convoluted storyline, it is good to see a renewed emphasis on character.  This is the brilliance in spreading this final episode out over two films (apart from the extra dollars to be made).  Many of the other films have felt rushed, and the scenes in which our heroes camp out in isolation would surely have been greatly curtailed if not cut altogether without the breathing room this approach provides.  I appreciate that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves did not pack in a few more breathless escapes or big action set pieces.  Instead, we have a chance to get reacquainted with the three protagonists and spend some quiet time with them before the explosive climax that is sure to come.
4770030096|5.0|This is a very good material to start learning Japanese without a teacher. The lessons have a very logical structure. The themes of the lessons are useful in the everyday life, interesting for adults too. All new words are collected on the bottom of the pages and at the end of the book. I uploaded the audio to my phone and I listened it during travelling.<br /><br />First I only purchased the first part, but since learning went very well with it, soon I purchased parts II and III as well.
0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss has been hyped beyond belief in the book blogging community. Sometimes hype turns out to be really right, and sometimes it ends up letting me down. Either way, I knew I had to buy this book the day it came out. There was no way I could not.<br /><br />And luckily - Anna and the French Kiss more than impressed me. In fact, I would go so far as to say it was my favourite book of 2010. Really. I really, truly mean that. There was such an awesome combination of various elements in Anna and the French Kiss that really worked and made it what it was. Separately, I don't know that I would have likde it as much, but the way everything in the story came together rocked.<br /><br />I am a sucker for boarding schools. And books that take place in foreign countries. And books that deal with issues other than just getting the guy. This book had several other issues - friend problems, parent problems, etc. I'm also a fan of  sexy guys. And you know what? Not only was the love interest in this book totally sexy, he was British. Do you guys see how all these elements are starting to add up?<br /><br />And Anna? I loved her. And I love Stephanie Perkins. I AM SUCH A FILM GEEK. So add into the melting pot of awesome elements Anna's film geekiness that rivaled my own. Seriously. I want her to be my best friend. Anna is my version of Anna Reads and Makeshift Bookmark's Jessica Darling.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. Etienne St. Clair. I have no other words. Isn't his name enough?<br /><br />What really, really gets me about Anna and the French Kiss, though, is that Stephanie Perkins is a debut author. And she is phenomenal. Her characters, her story - her writing. She is phenomenal. Here, see for yourself -<br /><br />\\"If this were vacation, I'm sure I'd be charmed. I'd buy an Eiffel Tower key chain, take pictures of the cobblestones, and order a platter of escargot. But I'm not on vacation. I am here to live, and I feel small.\\" - Anna and the French Kiss, page 19<br /><br />I just don't know what else to say about this book. It is SO FREAKING GOOD. Stephanie Perkins has another book coming out , Lola and the Boy Next Door (2011), and recently announced the sale of her third book, Isla and the Happily Ever After (2012).

0545123275|5.0|Okay. Lots of people have told me to read Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater. I didn't listen. I said, \\"pah, werewolves? That's creepy and unfun.\\" And then I read Nightshade by Andrea Cremer and I realized - werewolves? They're actually kind of sexy. So I finally decided to pick up Shiver.<br /><br />And I admit it. You guys were right. Maggie Stiefvater rocks. She is a werewolf goddess. I am officially converted. I've never been a huge vampire/werewolf fan, but I loved Shiver.<br /><br />What I like most about Maggie Stiefvater's werewolves is that they're not actually werewolves. Just like Carrie Ryan and her zombies, Maggie doesn't really ever call the wolves \\"werewolves\\" which is classy. These wolves were unlike any other werewolf I've seen in books or TV or movies. She really took the idea and made it her own.<br /><br />Grace was an interesting character in that I didn't understand her logic. If there were wolves chilling around my house, I'd keep my cats inside and flip out. And probably move. ESPECIALLY considering what happened to her as a kid. Grace was also interesting in that she was an interesting character, but mostly I really wanted to understand why she was so calm with the wolves.<br /><br />Sam was great. I'm usually not into the protective doting loving guy in literature. They usually bore me - I want danger and mystery and mixed signals and what not. But Sam was kind of all the above. He was sweet and nice, but still dangerous and mysterious.<br /><br />The storyline was great. Even if there were moments where I could totally tell what was coming next, I was usually wrong. Although Sam and Grace were the main characters in Shiver, there were a ton of other really great characters that helped to shape the storyline into what it was and make everything more interesting. If it had just been about the love story between Grace and Sam, I think I would have gotten bored very quickly, but that and all the other events and characters really helped to make a great book.<br /><br />And agh! The ending. It was closure enough so that I didn't have to rush out and buy the next book, which is great for several reasons. Number one being, I like closure. Number two - I really enjoy the anticipation of waiting for a book. I hate reading a book and reading the next one in the series immediately after it. But, despite the semi-closure, I still really, really want to read the next book.<br /><br />Overall - fantastic book. I loved Shiver and I will definitely be picking up Linger, and eagerly awaiting the third book in the series, Forever, which releases July 2011.closure enough so that I didn't have to rush out and buy the next book, which is great for several reasons.

B0006GANN2|5.0|In \\"The French Connection,\\" French drug-dealer Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) plans to smuggle 120 pounds of heroin into New York City and return to France with the money that he would receive from the sale of the dope, but NYC detective Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) exhibits reckless determination in attempting to put the kibosh on the transaction and bring the smugglers to justice.<br /><br />Hackman won his first Academy Award in this spectacular film which netted five Oscars overall, including Best Picture for 1971.  The tension builds slowly throughout the movie as Doyle and fellow detective Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) stalk the villains.  Judicious use of dramatic music heightens the suspense, and the portrayal of New York City is so gritty that the Big Apple of the early Seventies ends up being another star in the film.  The chase scene is legendary (one of the pleasures of the film is seeing all of the period cars), and the movie culminates in a shocking ending.<br /><br />If you like adventure films, you simply have to see this movie at some point in life.  Nearly four decades after its release, \\"The French Connection\\" is not simply one of the best crime/adventure films ever, it is one of the best films ever, period.

0141439807|4.0|I suppose that this being an Austen novel makes what I'm about to write less of a review and more of a \\"here's my thoughts on a classic novel\\" bit.<br /><br />The thing is, I love me some Austen and therefore...I liked Mansfield Park just fine. I liked it the way I liked Emma...that being, I'm glad I read it, I may read it again, but it didn't hold sway with me the way Sense & Sensibility (by far my favorite Austen novel) did.<br /><br />Part of my problem was, I think, that I read the introduction included in my version of the novel before I read the novel itself--and this particular introduction basically revealed the entire plot! Had it not been for reading this, I think I may have liked this novel more because I would have maybe been a bit surprised at the goings-on in the last 100-150 pages. Hence why I thought about giving this novel three stars, but instead gave it four (can't fault Austen because some modern-day person wrote a spoiler-filled intro!)<br /><br />As is, I do feel that the ending of Mansfield Park was a bit of a cop-out. I have to admit that I wish this particular Austen novel had taken a different road. At the risk of putting a spoiler out there for anyone who hasn't read this novel or seen the movies based on it--I really was hoping that in this case, a rake wasn't always a rake and that for once Austen would go a different way with some of her characters. Ah well.

1400032717|5.0|One of the books I've read over the past week was \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.\\" This book was written by Mark Haddon; a good author to follow and read.  The book talks about a guy named Christopher John Francis who is a big fan of the Sherlock Holmes novels and works on finding out who was responsible for the gruesome crime of killing a little French poodle.  As you read on Christopher is not the kind of guy who makes run on sentences.  Christopher is a young boy and has autism which is a little bit of what I have.  Later in the story, he starts to discover less about how the dog was killed but ultimately learns who is responsible for this act of killing a defenseless animal.       This book is great for those who are getting started in High School.  When I first read this book I was already inspired by the character Christopher and his endeavor of revealing the truth.  This book is very impressive in lots of ways and from numerous other reviews seems to be a winning novel.  This is one book that you don't want to miss in your High School year.  I'm looking forward to other books that are similar like this great story.

B00428ZRFY|3.0|Somehow I have slipped up & become a Rihanna fan!  Initially I wasn't going to purchase the whole album because I didn't like the lead track, ONLY GIRL IN THE WORLD. The release of the insanely catchy track, WHAT'S MY NAME convinced me that the album might be made of different variations of danceable, fun tracks instead of all techno sounding tracks.<br /><br />Rihanna along with her team is doing a great job of making her a chameleon in the music industry.  They always seem to pick great songs that she can put her stamp on with unique vocals.  At first I thought that I'd get tired of her changing up her style and not really creating a signature sound but music is supposed to be fun and since she debuted I have enjoyed quite a few of her songs so maybe just the fact that she totally OWNS her singing style and is confident in that style IS her signature!<br /><br />The tracks I really like are:<br /><br />WMN - definitely one of my favorite tracks, I like the Drake assist but wish that instead of just the opening lyrics, he'd rapped throughout the song to give it more balance;<br /><br />S&M - although the lyrics are really racy, I like this track (the beat reminds me a little of DISTURBIA);<br /><br />FADING - the opening of this song reminds me a little of Beyonce's HALO before it segues into a bouncy kiss-off track detailing fading feelings for an ex;<br /><br />CALIFORNIA KING BED - has a kind of neo-soulish feel, I like the softer moments of the song and hope it gets released as a single;<br /><br />SKIN - sexy moody ballad;<br /><br />CHEERS (DRINK TO THAT) - this one grew on me, I love the Avril Levigne sample and the ending where the crowd is singing without music.<br /><br />My ok tracks: RAINING MEN F/ NICKI MINAJ - it's catchy but \\"meh\\" to me, LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE (PT II)- the edgy song is made softer coming from the woman's perspective but I never warmed up to the original so this isn't a track I like to listen to & OGITW - a techno-synthy sounding dance track that I think is too big a song for her vocal ability but since I've gotten a chance to hear it a few times, I don't hate it as much as I originally did but it's just not a favorite of mine.<br /><br />The tracks I really don't like are: MAN DOWN - a dark lyrical song detailing her shooting of her boyfriend, her accent is really thick on this track giving it a dancehall feel but the song does nothing for me & COMPLICATED - I hate when she hits that high note of the word complicated.<br /><br />This album is more on par with GGGB in terms of having a lot of tracks that are radio-friendly and that will probably chart well. Overall I wish they had gone all out and created a thematic LOUD album (like Kelis').

0316098337|5.0|Not often, will I pick up a book and then not put it down until I have finished.   But that is what happened with this book.    From the opening pages, the story of a mother and son, being held captive by a depraved loner and the life these 2 prisoners lead, fascinates the reader.     The story of the mother's kidnapping and subsequent imprisonment is slowly revealed, all relayed to us via the narrator of this story - her son, Jack.        This book also mirrors some real life stories of recent years, where young women have been kept imprisoned for gratification by evil men.    The author provides a glimpse into what that life must be like, especially through the eyes of a child, who has never known what \\"normal life\\" is like.   Plus what life is like, after escaping such torment.      I highly recommend this book to all.    Its thought provoking, well written and an all round, good read.
B00004SA8A|5.0|My greatest disappointment was not hearing Kempff live. I had tickets for a Sunday afternoon recital he was due to give at London's Royal Festival Hall late in his career, and it was only after taking our seats I discovered he had cancelled: we heard Shura Cherkassky instead. He was good - but I so wanted to hear Kempff!<br /><br />These recordings were made over 4 years in the pianists late 60's/early 70's. The technique is still good - though there is the occasional splash [as in the last movement of D.784]. But their chief value is that Kempff allows us to hear Schubert as his friends must have heard him when he first played them in private. There is nothing at all flashy about the performances, no concert-hall projection, just intimate music making that gets to the heart of these elusive scores. Here we get 18 of the 21 sonatas which survive either complete or as fragments. Missing are sonatas #7 - D.567, #9 - D.571 with D.640 and D.570 i&ii, and #11 - D.613.  Those unfinished by the composer are left as torsos, without any moderate [Badura Skoda] or radical [Tirimo] re-constructions and conjectural completions.<br /><br />There are pianists who play these works with greater [often misplaced] bravura: but none, I suggest, who get to the heart of the music with such directness and selfless simplicity. These are performances to hear and hear again; and they warm the heart as few others can.<br /><br />Edit: In a recent survey of all available recordings of Schubert's last sonata [D960] for 'Gramophone' magazine, Bryce Morrison chose Kempff's recording as the finest of all. [Kempff, incidentally, includes the first movement exposition repeat which many pianists omit.]

0891419063|5.0|I enjoy first-hand accounts of what the war was actually like, and this is the best book I've read along those lines. What comes across after a while is that there are just no words to adequately descibe the feelings, emotions, and sights that these men had to come to grips with and endure. It is also very good at describing what it's like to hump ammo and supplies through the mud as part of the day to day routine of a frontline Marine, and having to forgo sleep and food for days on end if you wanted to survive. Things like that, that are never mentioned in other books or movies, are what make this book unique. You definitely won't be disapointed with this well written personal account of hell on earth. I've given 2 copies as gifts since reading it.
030726999X|5.0|The Stieg Larsson dance passed me by for months. Suspicion at this wave of adulation held me off.  But after seeing half the sentient, book reading world transfixed in airports and trains by his books, I succumbed by catching  the first two books at the movies.  Both films are thrilling.  Seduced,  I bought the third book  and found this mystery either a wonderful seat mate for a long flight or a tale to  rob you of your sleep time.  In the 700 + pages, Larsson grabs the reader as he sustains three fascinating story lines, all tangentially linked to the main story of Lisbeth Salander. Characters are substantive, refreshing, good and even evil doers get equal treatment regardless if they are wrapped in warped views of national security or committed to freedom of the press or justice for the battered past of Ms. Salander.  Larsson never rushes the story along, he takes his time to develop and enliven their personalities. His action scenes are quick and deadly and the ending wonderfully drawn out and clever.  A distinct undercurrent of Larsson's politics and gender preference pervades but this adds to the drama. Sadly, the dance ends with Larsson's untimely death. The rumor of another book gives this reader hope.
B0043RT8JU|5.0|For starters, I don't typically write reviews. It's difficult for me to think a novel is fantastic enough to write about and when I actually come across one of those rare books it's difficult to put into words how I felt about it. I hadn't heard of John Green but I came across Paper Towns at my local bookstore. I normally don't read YA books, but after reading the prologue and first chapter I knew I wouldn't be putting it down anytime soon.<br /><br />On the surface it's just another coming of age story; dorky kid in love with gorgeous, popular, well-loved girl, said girl takes boy on a wild ride, boy finds himself doing things he wouldn't ordinarily do. But there was something so profound, err...special about this book that while reading it I was falling in love with each and every word on each and every page.<br /><br />Before I knew it I was hearing \\"we will be closing in ten minutes\\" over the loud speaker and realized I had sat in store reading the entire book all day. I remember laughing out loud at parts of the story (meanly the dialogue between the three best friends) and having strangers look at me funny, but other than that the world could have ended and I wouldn't have noticed because I was lost in Paper Towns with paper people in paper houses and minivans and characters that made me laugh and made me want to cry and made me realize things about myself that haunted me for days after reading (and purchasing) this book.<br /><br />I proceeded to be a zombie the next few weeks in classes and at work because I could not, for the life of me, get this book and these characters out of my head.  I had never had a book affect me so much, and trust me, I read A LOT of books. So of course it came as a surprised that a YA book did this to me. For anyone in doubt about giving this book a try, don't hesitate. You have nothing to lose and I hope it keeps you thinking about it for days (and weeks) afterward as it did me.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I am very picky about image quality and I will say that this is a phenomenal looking series! I did see some of the ISO Noise in the Pilot disc and I understand this is noise from the LOW LIGHT taping. Other parts of the first series look sharp and incredibly detailed.<br /><br />I know this is HD because I can see the blemishes on the actors' faces! HD is almost too honest!<br /><br />Well worth picking up, if you missed the series, HD is beautiful! I will update this as I get through the series! ps make sure you watch the deleted scenes for the pilot!
B003L77TZI|1.0|If ever a singer was born with a flat boring voice,Katy Perry was/is. Her top song \\"Fireworks\\",is another example of a dumb song sung by an even more juvenile singer.When I see Katy Perry sing on award shows I realize that she isn't a singer at all,just another minimal talent dressed up like a sexy lady with silly props to prop up the no-talent. Calling her Generic would be too kind.She is a parody of a singer.Don't buy this rubbish.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|I owned the previous set that only had the first and second movies and this one is even better. My daughter and I spent a whole saturday watching all three movies plus all the extras. The Toy Box case is cute but makes it hard to get the movies out sometimes. Other than that, if you like the Toy Story series, its a great set.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I don't usually review movies on Amazon since I buy so many but figured I would for this one because it really surprised me.  A friend of mine talked about how much he enjoyed the  movie, but I had no interest in a \\"fake superhero\\" movie.  Turns out, Kick Ass, is  more than that.  It's part love story, part crime drama, part comedy.  Plus, there are moments of gratuitous violence.    All in all, a strange, but good movie.  I really enjoyed it.
0061684384|5.0|Kat Von D is one of the best.  This book gives you a look at Kat behind the scenes.  Excellent reading.
1400079144|1.0|My friends warned me, but still I bought the book and read it.  I had read Dan Brown's previous books, but I guess I was hoping he would have fixed a few things by now.  He had not.  The book is overlong and preachy.  In the beginning we are told that the main character suffers from claustrophobia, something that was never mentioned in previous books to which this is a sequel.  Flexi-time is used again shamelessly - nobody can do all those things within that time!  The book must have been commissioned by either the Freemasons or the Washington DC Tourist Board, because it certainly read like a tourist guide.  I don't know if Dan Brown has any more books in the pipeline, but if he has, I think I'll steer clear from them.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|Well this was amazing.  It was as good as the first Predator movie and if you ask me it is due to the writing.  I won't spoil anything but it adds to the Predator mythology and was a great action packed film with great actors and amazing directing.  I really hope they make another one with the same writers and director.  I did not expect this movie to be this good.  I am so buying this and it will sit next to Predator on my shelf and when my child is old enough I will let him see them and never mention the other ones like I will do with Star Wars.  A must see film.

0805047905|2.0|Like all of the author's books, the characters in this book are so stylized that they hardly hold any semblance to reality.  Really seems inappropriate for young chilldren if you actually want to teach them what these animals look like.  It is certainly passable if teaching colors is the only goal.
0307593525|5.0|I was trying to find a French book for a few months now and found this one.  It is worth the price!  Child is such a good detailed writer and explains everything step by step.<br /><br />If I were you, I would buy this book!
B0011HOEY4|2.0|Rusell Crow gives an OSCAR PERFORMANCE. Crowe is spectacular; he salvages the movie. Unfortunately for Crow that particular year the Oscars were not given based on good acting. It was one of those political based years. The movie is worth renting, perhaps on a rainy when you arrive late at the video store.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a great CPU cooler for its price. Current I have 3.00 GHZ Pentium Dual core overclocked to 3.6 GHZ, before my CPU idle temp would sit at 58-59C, with the cooler my CPU temp dropped to 41C at idle and the highest my CPU temp has gotten under load is 49C. Couldn't be happier.
B000008H4E|4.0|There's a mystical place out there in the stars most people can't even dream of these days, but way back when, Jon and Vangelis had a real knack for taking us there. From my first listening when this first came out on LP, I distinctly recall saying to myself,\\"That's it! That's the music of some distant world I've visited before in my dreams but couldn't put my finger on\\". \\"Love is\\" remains one of the most spellbinding melodies ever crafted by these two voyagers. This is more than just music... this is where we came from and where we're going to. Give it a listen.
0812469496|3.0|My sister was given this book by her MIL when she had her baby. Her MIL said she used to read this to her kids when they were little. We had never heard of it, but we sat and laughed and laughed over the creepiness of the mom sneaking into her grown son's room. Just plain old weird. Parts of the book are cute, but the end ruins it for me and takes all of the sweetness out of it.
0525423273|4.0|This was such a sweet book.  Such a light, cute young adult love story.  And I loved it!        First off, I love the idea of a boarding school in Paris.  Who wouldn't want to go there!  It sounds like it would have been so much fun.       I really liked all of the characters.  They were fun and they seemed like real teens.  They were all normal.  Not in the popular group, and not out of it.  Not awesome students but not bad either.  Just regular teenagers.   And St. Clair makes me want a boy born in the US but raised in England who can speak French!       The only complaint I have about this book is that I would have liked it to go on!  It's already a bigger book, but I would have loved to know what happened at the end of the school year, over the summer, and even into the freshman year of college!
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I have to say the makeup is much better on Rob as Edward.  But Kristen Stewarts wig is way way noticable.  You can tell it's a wig big time they should have found a lighter brown to match her skin tone.  My opinion Eclipse isn't as good as the first movie Twilight at all.  I think the movies would have been much better if they're all directed by Catherine Hardwicke to eliminate the jumpiness of the films to me.  You can definitely tell there were different directors and the moods and feelings of the cast shines through.  I do think the other two directors were good at they're job but Summit should have just picked one director and stayed with it.  I also think that the only real actors that were really into the movie and captivated the characters were the quilette pack, Charlie, and Alice.  The others seemed out of character from the first movie and ruined it for me.<br /><br />On a good note the cgi wolves were awesome!  The fight scenes were great!  I do find it weird that when the vampires were ripped apart they crumbled like rock instead of how the would just rip apart like regular flesh in the first movie.  The crumbling effect was cool but it should have been started in the first movie not something that up and changes and they expect no one to notice.  The actor that played Riley captivated him perfectly!  He couldn't have been better!  And Jaspers accent, I know he didn't talk much in the first two movies but his accent got really thick all of a sudden in this third movie.<br /><br />What us up with changing the Victoria character.  I understand Rachael L was demanding more money and the picked someone else but she didn't seem to play the character as well.  And again the wig the new girl was wearing was atrocious!  Who did the costumes and the wig picking!?!?!  They need to step back and take a look at what they send out of the trailer.  I'm not a fan of how they portrayed Bella in this movie.  She acted like a brat, ya she didn't want them to fight over her but at least act like you care for one of them.  The internal strife that Kristen tried to play was way off from the book big time.  Maybe if they filmed these more closely to each other and with the same director they would seem like a contination not a shredded frayed ribbon where one ends and anther movie starts.  They just didn't tie into each other they way they should have.act like you care for one of them.  The internal strife that Kristen tried to play was way off from the book big time.

B0013TTLDE|5.0|I can't even remember how I stumbled across this book, but from the first page, I was hooked. Kate Morton tells a wonderful tale and captures the reader in another time and eloquently weaves her way through time. I have also read The Forgotten Garden and equally loved every moment of that story. I'm just starting her new book and it seems to be every bit as wonderful as the first two. I truly hope Kate Morton continues to write such masterful works of family, friendship, and a little bit of love. She is a wonderfully gifted author and she deserves nothing less than 5 stars!!
143350393X|5.0|I absolutely love the ESV Study Bible. There is so much information, maps, commentary, and much more. If you are just starting out in God's word or in need of a good Study Bible that has a wealth of information, this is it.
B0043URV8M|2.0|Desplat is surely one of the better film music composers out there. I loved his soundtracks for New Moon and for Seriana. Although I hoped John Williams would return to HP7, I was nevertheless expecting a great musical work from Desplat. But now I'm truly deeply disappointed!!! Desplat didn't keep his promise that \\"I would take every opportunity to use the fabulous theme composed by John Williams. I'd say it has not sufficiently been used in the latest movies, so if I have the opportunity and if the footage allows me, I'm going to arrange it...I shall make it with great honour and pleasure.\\" I cannot remember a HP soundtrack which has used the Hedwig-Theme fewer than Desplat's has!    Some of the positive reviews the soundtrack has received were written by people who have listened to and reviewed the music before watching the movie. Well, I think it is not a bad soundtrack; but it is certainly a bad Harry Potter soundtrack!
B0046IGOIO|5.0|Ever since I first listened to Live in Detroit back in 2003, I was hooked on The Doors' live sets. There's a rawness and unpredictability that makes it a satisfying listen. You never know what Jimbo is going to spout out next.<br /><br />The sound quality isn't as vibrant as Live in Detroit and the song list isn't as diverse, but this concert features its own persona with the blues infusion. The CD comes in a cheap paper sleave but the price is reasonable. Another enjoyable time-capsule of The Doors live experience circa 1970.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. Inventive, imaginative and engaging, it will draw mature and young audiences alike. I never tire of warning this flick.
B00003CXB4|2.0|Although the new version of this classic is beautiful (I don't care for it- don't like alterations of originals) I bought this DVD for the sole purpose of owning the original version in DVD format. This DVD claims to have both versions of the film and that the viewer will be prompted to choose one. However, the screen that is supposed to give the viewer that choice NEVER happens.  I am very disappointed with this DVD and am hopeful to hear from the seller soon.  Perhaps he/she didn't know about this issue.
B0000DZTIL|4.0|This is a great imaginative flick. I recall watching this as a young teen and never understood why you could not seem to find it playing on cable or satellite over the years. Cool movie and great effects for it's time.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|I previously bought the Nite-Ize LED AA Maglite replacement without the switch and was very impressed with the brightness.  This unit was the same except it came with the tail-cap switch, which I elected not to use since it works great with the standard Maglite turn-to-activate.  The brightness is really impressive - you really can't look at it directly.  I would have preferred to purchase only the LED for a bit less money, but this combo package was worth the price, it included free shipping and the product worked great.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This was absolutely fabulous - so much more than I expected.  Even my grandchildren (3 and 1) loved it.  I highly recommend it.
B002N5N5M0|3.0|I ordered a dvd, it arrived in record time I was very impress.  However the 1 disc was loose in the cover & scratched so much it is impossible to watch it, contacted the company & did not receive any response.
1439177783|5.0|This was a very insightful look not only at the author but at the challenges and struggles she represents throughout the telling. It is sad that such a beautiful person (inside and out) would feel compelled to \\"punish\\" herself and seem to never measure up to her own standards and expectations. Her book is a true testament to the bias not only in Hollywood but deep within in our culture. It is definitely a must read for anyone who has ever felt unaccepted or as though they just didn't fit in. Beauty is not what others see when they look at us, it's what reflections we see in ourselves.
B000UFLSBA|2.0|I ordered this movie, \\"Sleuth\\" and was not told that it was in a foreign language.  When i contacted the woman who sent it to me, she told be to try looking for the english overlay.  I couldn't make it play in English, so the movie is of no use to me.  I am greatly disappointed, but will keep it anyway because I work with people who may help me to get it voiced in English.  Too much trouble for what I should have gotten.  Nowhere on the site does it say that the movie is Polish, or Russian, or any other language than English.
1439107955|5.0|Siddhartha Mukherjee attempts to thread a very difficult needle with this book -- address arguably the most significant pathology of our time (certainly in terms of the public imagination); offer a strong foundation in its history, basic mechanics, and prognosis; and all the while, do so in a way that is interesting to a knowledgeable reader yet accessible to a general reader.  In my view, he succeeds wonderfully.  No, he doesn't comprehensively detail the current leading edge of science -- but given the pace of recent change, to do so in more than a general way would render a large component of the book obsolete in a matter of years.  Instead, he gives us something far more substantial, and something likely to retain a place of permanent relevance in books about the field: a look into the nature of this disease as it relates to the nature of ourselves, couched elegantly in an thoughtful and articulate survey of its history with particular attention paid to several individuals seminal to this history and others who are among an endless stream of passing bit players affected by this history ... consistently drawing the universal from the specific.  Whether it is Farber or one of his own patients, Mukherjee has carefully framed a cast of characters that give body to this stubborn and ethereal disease.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and highly recommend it to anyone interested in cancer or the nature of disease in the modern era.
0061914177|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a client, and I ended up reading it in two days, which says a lot. Normally because of how busy I am, when I attempt to read a book, by the time I get halfway through it the pages have discoloured. It was literally impossible for me to put this book down.<br /><br />From a freelance writer's perspective, Crush It! is perfect for those writers who want to turn their passion into a full-time career, and it gives a step-by-step approach on how to use social marketing properly to create your own opportunities, instead of depending on a mindrotting 9-5 job that dictates your existence.  I have always felt very strongly about being happy with what you do, and that who you are and what you do are heavily intertwined; this book has given me a revised perspective on my career, as I have always felt the same way that Gary does, I just wasn't able to clearly define my viewpoint before.<br /><br />Favourite quote:<br />\\"Too many people ignore their DNA... to conform to what their families or society expects of them. A lot of people also decide that professional success has to look a certain way. That's how someone born to design bikes winds up becoming a lawyer, or someone who loves experimenting with makeup works every day pitching someone else's overpriced brand to malls around the country, or someone who cannot go a day without jotting down some ideas for their next poem spends most of their time at the helm of an emergency IT department. To me that's insane... it drives me crazy to know that there are still people out there who haven't figured out that they don't have to settle.\\"<br /><br />I especially recommend this book to other bloggers, and those who write for niche markets. Your time is now!
B001UV4XFG|3.0|the product will be fine (i suppose) whenever it gets here.  i have used amazon for years and never had any problems.  BUT when i purchased New Moon, I was able to watch it on the release date on my Roku instant player at home.  SOOO i assumed (bad, i know) that this video, Eclipse, would be the same.  it seems I was wrong.  now the delivery date is pushed back from dec.6 to DEC.10 ---- WHY?  i could have already bought it at the store.  c'mon amazon - you're better than this.  yuck.
B003EYVXTG|2.0|Kept waiting for something to happen.  Riveting - I don't think so.  More of a slice of \\"Deliverance\\" life than a thriller.  The acting was well done, but I have to honestly say that I was extremely disappointed after what I read and having such high hopes.  Good, but not great storytelling.  Could have been done better.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|If you are not a Maroon 5, fan this album will make you one!  I cant stop listening to it.  The brilliant combination of sexuality and emotion that you can feel and hear in these songs makes Maroon 5 amazing musicans/songwriters .  The music and lyrics just capture you.  Never Gonna Leave This Bed and How are ones I recommend you listen to loud, in fact, the whole album is blairable.  Fanfreakintastic!
B001VNB54A|5.0|OUTSTANDING will enjoy watching for years to come. I will also advise others what a spectacular work this really is.
1439177783|5.0|An inspiring story written with brutal honesty.  Portia de Rossi is as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I thought it was a great idea to make a tv series about zombies. Each episode is entertaining and suspenseful. The zombie effects and gore are amazing. You get to know the characters and begin to care for them in their struggle to survive a zombie apocalypse. When waking up from a coma, police officer Rick Grimes is thrust into a chaotic world. He is looking for his wife and son, who are surviving with another group in Atlanta. When they all meet up, they must work together and trust each other if they wanna live to fight another day. I highly recommend THE WALKING DEAD: SEASON ONE!!!
B003QZ5222|3.0|This set is a great value.  Unfortunately, there seems to be something wrong with the \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" discs.  I've purchased two copies of this set: one at a local music store which I returned because of this problem, and then one from Amazon... which has the same problem. That disc in both sets could not be read on my computer.  The other discs were fine, and I can play the disc in my car.  But given that I rip everything to iTunes and will mainly listen to it on my iPod, it's an annoyance.  At this point, I'm just going to give up and buy it separately.
B003UYV08E|5.0|I usually watch the second installment to a really good movie with low expectations.  Iron Man 2 actually improved on the original Iron Man in every aspect.  The story picks up right where we left off, but immediately introduces us to one bad Russian dude who can seriously challenge Iron Man with the same technology he created in the first movie.  Tony's arrogance is expanded and the new characters who want to see Iron Man fail and who want the technology for their own benefit are perfectly cast.  Seeing the \\"good guy\\" played with a twisted personality could only have be done by Robert Downey, Jr.  It was a totally enjoyable movie that I quickly added to my DVD library.
0307454541|1.0|Ditto to all the reviewers who said \\"I can't believe the hype on this book \\" . Too many meaningless side stories which I did not care about--plus I figured out from almost the beginning what the deal was with Harriet and the flower pictures, which I thought was supposed to be the whole focus of the book (i.e., the mystery of her disappearance). I asked a friend who highly recommended the book, to put me out of my misery and just TELL ME if I was right, because I JUST COULD NOT GET PAST THE FIRST THIRD of the book (yes it took that long to set up the main story)
B000XCZGV8|5.0|God I love this movie! First of all I love David Fincher but this film is for me his best. I just watched it again yesterday. Every time I watch it I think \\"this is the best movie ever\\". There is something about the pace of the movie that makes it so good. Earlier this year I was reading through reviews for the best movies of the decade:2000-2009 and this movie was on many lists. It's in the storytelling. I remember that one reviewer said that the mood of this movie was like another character in the movie. Some people says it's too long, I don't agree it's perfect! The way the story unfolds piece by piece makes it an excellent thriller. I am looking for more movies with this kind of pace so if you have any suggestions let me know. Thx
0887431461|5.0|I teach my grand daughter at home as she wouldn't go to preschool.  She has learned so fast with all these work books, we are now doing the Kindergarten work books!  She loves the coloring and fun things to do in each book.
0439023513|2.0|My heart was pounding, alright, but that was during the first two books. In the beginning of this one, I was rather amazed at the kind of subjects being touched upon, but later I just felt like the characters were becoming less and less visible. Yes, the events are important, but to me characters are the most important part of the story. Especially in a series, it's amazing to see how they change, evolve, etc., but that didn't happen in this book.<br /><br />The war and violence seemed to just swallow the characters. I feel like these two subjects, unfortunately, aren't strangers to our generation. But when the characters weren't really there, it pretty much felt like watching the news on the television screen. Many times it made me wanna scream, \\"once more, please, WITH FEELING!\\" But nope.<br /><br />I also didn't like how Gale was nowhere to be found in the ending. I'm pretty sure a lot of the readers who made a connection with him were upset about that, too.<br /><br />I do like these series in general. While the second book is my favorite, I thought the first one was very good, too. I might just pretend this last one never happened.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Harking back to her classic work on albums such as The Mask and Mirror, Elemental, and The Visit (prior to her breakout hit with The Mummers' Dance), this is one of the strongest sets of work that Loreena has ever put out there.  These songs are bold, passionate and haunting.  And I simply had to write a review to say that the melancholy songs, from The Lady of Shalott to Dante's Prayer to The Highwayman, are some of my favorites.  The Celtic landscape has a dark side, and it is a beautiful one.  More like this please!
B003F256T0|5.0|I bought this for my 16 year old who LOVES ANYTHING DragonBall Z and he's going to be very happy to be getting this one for Christmas!  He collects (and plays) with them and this is one of the best - with all the faces and hands and very articulated!  Although I haven't personally inspected this toy (my son will do that), it looks very well made and the detail is excellent!  I would definately not hesitate to purchase such an item again.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Rihanna's highly anticipated 5th album delivers something for everyone to enjoy. The album is infused with dance tracks, ballads, stadium music and overall fun music. LOUD is a conglomeration of love & sex themed hits that make you listen to the whole album. Ms. Fenty takes you on a journey through a fantasy world of sexual stimulated hotness! The album is perfectly flowing which allows you to enjoy the album from head to toe.<br /><br />Best Tracks: S&M, What's My Name, Cheers (Drink To That), Only Girl, Man Down, Skin, Love The Way You Lie Part II (Piano Version)<br /><br />S&M: The album opener blows you away with a sexy and sassy lyrics over rock n' roll drums!<br /><br />What's My Name? (Feat. Drake): The island vibe of the track brings a funny and flirty vibe to the album. The hook is so infectious.<br /><br />Cheers (Drink To That): An anthem for any bar or group of friends getting ready to hit the town for some alcoholic fun!<br /><br />Fading: A great mid-tempo ballad that is playful.<br /><br />Only Girl (In The World): Addictive from the beginning and a great fun dance track!<br /><br />California King Bed: A thought ballad that shows Rihanna's vocal ability.<br /><br />Man Down: G4L Part II in my opinion with the Bajan Beauty's accent in full mode!<br /><br />Raining Man (Feat. Nicki Minaj): A fun track that is great, really didn't need any help from Nicki Minaj because it stands on its own.<br /><br />Complicated: A favorite of most people and Rihanna pours her heart out on this song.<br /><br />Skin: A very very sexy song that shows a very progressive side of Rihanna that could be a great stripper song or bedroom bang. The title says it all.<br /><br />Love The Way You Lie (Part II) (Feat. Eminem): Actually better than the original because it showcases more of Rihanna's vocals and she sounds amazing.
B0042AEOG0|4.0|If you like Mariah's old style, you will like this CD. It is very traditional and nice to listen to. One of my favorites is her Charlie Brown Christmas interpretation.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I throughly enjoy this album. Kanye West continues to be a hip hop storyteller and it not afraid to explore all his options with music. The album is put together with the upmost thoughtfulness and the flow is seamless. Some of the songs could have been a little bit shorter but once you actually start listening to the album you just fall into a zone. My favorite Kanye West album is still \\"Graduation\\" but this is my second favorite. It is great that the 808 & Heartbreak's Era is over because it wasn't the Kanye that I feel in love with. Their is an art to making music and Mr. West is continually mastering that ability.<br /><br />Best Tracks: Dark Fantasy (minus the narrator intro), Monster, Blame Game, Hell of A Life
B004A8EI9M|5.0|I've seen dozens of Zombie movies, mostly bad, and mostly for the comedy and makeup factors, but this TV series breaks the molds.  The writing, the acting, the pacing, the Zombies, the story line, the unpredictability of it make this series so refreshing, so surprising, so wonderful it's no wonder it's an instant hit.    These are shows I can watch again and again. I hope the series holds up, I really do.
0316113506|5.0|This book does a terrific job at explaining why physical exercise is key across the lifespan: Every educator and parent should read it. The author shows how physical exercise cues the brain to learning and affects mood, anxiety and attention skills. The science is there and easy to understand. However cognitive development and performance depend on several key elements. Physical exercise is one, the need for mental stimulation of the appropriate kind is another, along with stress management, a balanced diet, etc. Readers interested in a more comprehensive perspective on brain fitness based on the latest brain science could also take a look at the recent [[ASIN:0982362900 The Sharp Brains Guide to Brain Fitness: 18 Interviews with Scientists, Practical Advice, and Product Reviews, to Keep Your Brain Sharp]].
0385512104|4.0|This book had a lot of hidden meaning and 'dramatic irony' because of somethings Christopher did not understand. His voice is simplistic and logical. He is a very unique character. The author is incredibly talented. However, he's kind of a punk: maybe it's because I disagree with him on a lot of things. But that could also be another form of dramatic irony, and maybe the fact that he makes me mad sometimes means that the author is really really good. Definitely worth a read.

It was ordered on Nov. 2, 2010 and was suppose to be here at the latest on Nov. 26th and it is still not here.  I need the movie immediately or I need my refund immediately.  Please take care of this matter today!!  I'm very unhappy with Amazon.com, this was a birthday gift for my grandchild in Japan, and she is still waiting for that part of her present.  All of her presents were sent late because of waiting for this movie.    Please settle this matter now.    Marcia Hackerson
B004BSDKUE|3.0|As someone who hated \\"Your Love\\" when everyone was falling in love with it and someone who generally hates Young Money (except for Drake and ESPECIALLY Weezy!) I must admit that, thanks to \\"Right Through Me\\", I might be a fan. I read the other comments and listened to the whole album after falling in love with Right Through Me and had to admit that she is more pop that hardcore hiphop, which is why I like her. She is definitely the softer side of Young Money and thank God for that. The only thing stopping me from owning this CD is how impressed she is with herself, which is why I stay away from a lot of rap albums as a whole.
1439156816|5.0|I am a Realtor Emeritus in Montgomery County, Maryland. But I am writing this review as a former High School English teacher(NYC) and Advertising Copywriter. The grammer portion of this book is incredible. It should be required study in every high school and college in the US. It not only explains the rules of grammer in the simplest, easiest-to-understand terms, it shows readers how to write in a more colorful and dramatic way. I am sometimes asked to teach classes for Realtors on how to write ad copy that sells houses--( my ad copy does)  and I use this book as a text. Maxinwe Schwartzman
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I can see why so many teenagers and young adults have a hard time with this book.  Even though it was written for YA it definitely has a older edge to the book.  I really enjoyed the book (yes, there would have been a few things that I would have changed if I was the author) but since I am not, I think that Stephenie Meyer did an excellent job putting a happy ending to a wonderful series.  It all began with a meeting in a HS biology class and ended with Bella becoming an adult (yes, this can even happen when you are 18). Bella experienced so many dramatic changes in her life from the moment that she met Edward.  I am sure that most of the readers would not have expected Bella to become pregnant on her honeymoon.  OR that Jacob would imprint on Bella and Edward's daughter Renesmee, but there had to be a way to tie the story together so that Bella would have been able to keep both of the men that she loved in her life.  In the end, the reason that I give this book 5 stars is because I am not your typical targeted age group for this book series and I have to say that I was thoroughly please from the beginning to the end.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I will try my best to not exaggerate, but... here it goes:<br /><br />As others have mentioned, this show really isn't about zombies, it's about humanity when being faced with death. The season just wrapped up on AMC, and what can I say... it was a whirlwind of a ride! So much raw emotion, I have never come across a show, play, book... anything with this much humanity and emotion. This show will go down as one of the greatest of all time. My heart is still pounding from the finale! Great to know that the 2nd season was picked up. I can not wait! Thank you, AMC.
B000L53D4O|3.0|If you're just looking for a push toy or something for your little one to use to walk, this is good.  I wouldn't recommend it though if you want something that can double as an activity toy for sitting babies to use.  The different spinning and flipping things don't hold babies' attention because they are all the same concept and get boring and repetative.  I do like that it isn't musical though because not everything needs to be.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I watched Serenity with a friend. I hadn't seen any of the one and only year that Firefly was on TV so I had to get the bluray. I was not disappoined. I have to admit that part of the reason that I bought this was because I had been watching Summer Glau in the Terminator and thought she did such a wonderful job that I had to see what she had done in this series. This was a fun yet serious adventure story and well worth the cost. The picture quality is excellent. Unfortunately Fox terminated this series as well as the Terminator series when they would have done very well if they had kept them on air and done a little promotion.
0061730335|5.0|Jamie Rowe     The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind by William Kamkwamba and Bryan Mealer, tells the story of William Kamkwamba's life in poverty that drove him to teach himself about physics and determination in order to make electric wind and save his family from extreme famine. William's story is an inspiration to everyone. He teaches each and every one of us that we can truly learn anything. We can teach ourselves whatever our hearts desire. William teaches us that all we need is determination. All that we need to make our dreams come true, all that we need to learn anything is determination, and William is certainly determined. William also teaches us that an education, however we achieve it, can stretch so much farther than ourselves. We can use what we learn in order to change our lives, change our views and the views of others, and like William, we can use our knowledge to change the world.     I absolutely loved this book because William refuses to give up. He refuses to accept that just because he does not have the money for an education, it does not mean that he has to give up. So he teaches himself, he uses his imagination and unbridled determination to not only educate himself, but to build a windmill, provide electricity for his family, and change their lives forever. This book is heartwarming and inspirational. You become immediate friends with William and want only the best for him and his family. He is a humble boy in a humble town that changes his world, and it was a pleasure to read his story. He can teach all of us so much about teaching, life, hope and the power of our dreams.

0061777250|5.0|This and the book by Chris Carter very much demonstrate why dualism is the best explanation for NDEs. Both of these books demonstrate why competing explanations used to explain NDEs do not remotely explain the data. I would strongly encourage anyone who wants to study this fascinating subject to read this book.    Ignore the one star by Gerry. He has zero credibility anymore as an NDE researcher. I showed in the discussion part of his book review how his explanations cannot remotely account for features in  NDEs and I showed how he  makes basic logical fallacies.

I read this book to see if I would like it and as soon as I finished I could not wait to read the rest of this series.  This book is great for all ages.  There is nothing in this book that is inaporpreate for younger children.
0393072231|5.0|A great read and explanation for what occured.  The book is far more engaging then the topic suggests.  The writing and research are excellent; I enjoyed it immensely.
067960085X|1.0|I read the reviews on this story, the 5 stars and the 1 one, but I thought I would give it a try.  Wish I hadn't.<br /><br />What does nonsensical mean?  \\"Having no meaning or direction or purpose.\\"  Exactly what this story represents.  There is no depth to Holly Golightly's character.  She talks in trivial roundabouts, is selfish and did nothing but try my patience.  The narrator is flat, a wimp, and has no backbone.  The story consists of mostly dialog, giving the reader no sense of being there.  When I read it, I was thinking \\"blah, blah, blah\\" the whole time.<br /><br />As a librarian, I really do give every book I read a try, but I felt this story was nothing but complete DRIVEL!
B001O4MZ6I|4.0|For some reason I hadn't purchased this Soundtrack earlier, but we went to see the Broadway play which is an automatic gotta have the soundtrack. This particular soundtrack is my favorite. The Broadway edition is okay - but Olivia and John did such a memorable job.     I would have given this five stars easy - EXCEPT the way this downloads is a real pain. It downloads in something like 4 folders and it's hard to find all the folders to get the songs to show up in the player.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I thought I was over zombies. I was wrong, and I found that out half way through the first episode of The Walking Dead. Like the original \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" all really great zombie pictures have been \\"life boat\\" stories: Strangers trapped in a confined space surrounded by danger. That means that at the heart of the story are the emotional dynamics between the living characters, but one character is going to really stand out; in The Walking Dead, that character is Sheriff Rick Grimes played by Andrew Lincoln. From the very first scene we know that he is a vulnerable man with heart and emotional pain, a man who must have entered law enforcement to help people, and rises to the need of the moment. Andrew Lincoln portrays Grimes with subtlety and depth. By the second episode I was hooked: I really cared about Rick, and then about his family, and finally about the circle of people whom he comes to lead. Not since Jack Shepard (Matthew Fox) in Lost have I felt this connected with a character. I am SO looking forward to season 2!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|When my husband told me I needed to check out this new zombie show, I was a bit skeptical, to say the least. However, I quickly became hooked. \\"The Walking Dead\\" is an amazing, character-driven drama that also includes an amazing global zombie plot. (Side note: I am dying to win a stagger-on role in Season 2!) It's a fantastic show and I encourage everyone to check it out. The only two things that bug me about it are the fact that Season 1 was only six episodes long (whose stupid idea was that?!) and also that, except for the characters of Rick and his young son, Carl, most of the other characters really annoy the heck out of me. I find myself hoping that they all get killed by zombies. Hopefully the show introduces some more likable characters in Season 2.
B001HN69AY|2.0|This is one of those movies that when reading the case I thought was going to become one of my favorite movies.  I was wrong. It is definately a different kind of movie which is usually what I like to see, new ground.  It seems to me though, it is just weird for the sake of being as weird as possible.  The story is kind of dull however and I was never really drawn in. I almost fell asleep. If you want to see some really awesome visuals, the like of which you've never seen rent or buy it, otherwise forget it.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|A friend suggested this band to me so when I saw it on sale for Cyber Monday, I thought \\"why not?\\". Best decision ever!! I have found myself stunned by some of the songs and it is now on repeat in my car. Im a big fan!
B0041OOJNU|5.0|I thought we had lost Shakira's original essence after the mediocre \\"She Wolf\\", where she pretty much became one more Britney Spears.    With this new album, though, she is back to prove once again why she is the best.  Her new songs show much of her latin yet rock-infused creations.  You can hear a little bit of Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones in some of these songs.  There is an evident Dominican merengue influence as well.    I truly admire her voice and all she can do with it, but I wish she would work on her vocalization.  I am originally from her same country, and I have a hard time understanding her lyrics in Spanish. My wife is American and she can't understand her lyrics in English.  You pretty much have to follow the booklet to fully understand her lyrics regardless of the language, but nevertheless she is awesome on this new CD. Highly recommended.

B003UYUP58|5.0|Siddhartha Mukherjee's writing informs but more importantly enlightens the reader. I learned so much. I only wish I had known about this book earlier.
0439023513|3.0|I thought the second book was the best in the series and I was very excited after reading it to get to the third book, but after reading Mockingjay I felt manipulated.  And I couldn't shake the feeling that the success of the previous two books had somehow made SC lazy.  Her style is sloppier in this book. The pacing, one of her strongsuits, is also off balance in this book.  It feels a little phoned in.  The plot twists at the end, compelling though they are, are cheap tricks compared to the tougher work of rounding out Katniss's character and finding a way to give the readers what you've spent two books conditioning them expect and still surprise them.  She had a tremendous opportunity here to grow as a writer and leave behind a series that might be considered literature some day, but she blew it.    SC threw the whole series away with this book.  The key conflicts she sets up: the confrontation with Snow and the Peeta/Gale thing.  She spends two and half books setting them up and throws Snow out for the sake of a last minute twist. She glosses over the Peeta/Gale thing like it was some minor issue that never really mattered in the first place.  Maybe the whole thing with Coin was a twist for the sake of a twist because she thinks twists are what people expect in their fiction these days.  At this point a more unconventional ending to a series might be to actually give the readers what you set them up to expect.  Nobody does that anymore.  It might surprise a reader more if there was no last minute twist.  Giving her the benefit of the doubt on that, I'm left to conclude that maybe she was trying to make a political statement about the fatalism of real world politics.  I don't know.  Problem is, her style gets in the way when she reaches that far.  Every time SC tries to dig a little deeper, delve into bigger themes or get sentimental, she fails.  Because she's good at writing action, and little else.  She might have sold me on a dark, muddy ending if she had thewriting chops to do it, if she'd made us love Katniss more than we hate Snow, but she didn't pull that off.    SC is good at action and pacing, but she's not the kind of writer that makes you admire her writing.  You admire her story.  Every time she attempts to be sentimental or deep, it comes off trite.  Don't get me wrong.  I read all three books in five days and anybody who can make you do that has talent, but every now and then, she tries some rhetorical flourish that just makes you cringe.  I didn't notice this as much in the first book, but as the books progress (and the series gets more popular), I get the sense that her editors did less to reign in the bad Hallmark movie stuff.    SC had a good idea and she did a decent job developing it, but I would love to have seen this same premise in more capable hands.
0312600844|4.0|This novel is a great read that kept me up for several nights past my bed time.  At first, I loved it.  I even had the thought, \\"This might be the best book I've ever read!\\"    What I loved about it was its genius at mimesis, as Ruth Franklin said in her review of it in The New Republic.  Franzen is very, very good at holding a mirror up to nature in the 21st century.  At points the book is very funny because of this accuracy, which easily becomes satirical since our own age is so absurd.    Also at first I found the characters interesting, and their evolution from childhood to middle age compelling.  In this way, the novel is like a Dickens novel, kind of like Great Expectations.    But the neatly tied up \\"happy\\" ending seemed really implausible to me, and kind of a betrayal of everything that went before.    Also, like Ruth Franklin, I thought Franzen had a masculinist view of female sexuality that was not very accurate.  The women in the novel are mostly pitiful and piteous, hankering after unavailable men, and humiliating themselves to make themselves pleasing to the men, in ways that Franzen doesn't seem to see as pathological.  He even seems to endorse the long-suffering Connie's hanging on to JOey, for which she is in the end rewarded, just as Patty is rewarded for totally humiliating herself at the end vis a vis Walter, to the point of almost freezing to death \\"for love.\\"  Barf.
142311339X|3.0|After reading the Percy Jackson series, I was hungry for more, and was disappointed that there wasn't going to be another one.  Now The Lost Hero, is very much related to the Percy Jackson series, but this first book isn't really as good.  I do miss following Percy and Annabeth and would rather it be them, who do have a minor role in this first book, but it hints at a larger role in the books to follow.  The book jumps is in a third person perspective and switches between the three main characters, Jason, Piper, and Leo.  So while yes, I miss the adventures of Percy and Annabeth, and this overall story isn't as captivating, I would still recommend reading it as it was still a fairly fun read.  The next book is called the Lost Hero, Son of Neptune and I do plan on reading that when it releases as the way it sounds it will be a parallel with this book, but from Percy's perspective.  Hopefully this can bring us closer to what the Original Percy Jackson books were and then on third installment they can maybe combine what's best between the two series.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|I dont really understand the 4 or 5 star reviews for this movie.  Maybe the reviewer was too young to see Heat when it came out in the mid-90's.  While the Town is a good movie and I enjoyed it, I couldn't help feeling that I was watching Heat 2.  Everything was predictable, I wasn't watching anything that hadn't been done before.  Dont get me wrong, the acting was good, the directing was good.  It was just new flesh thrown on old bones.
0783219695|5.0|So many reviews have already been written, critiquing the details. I, therefore, would just like categorize this as a great movie that triumphs the imagination, inventiveness, and creative ability of the human person. In such a time-critical situation with such limited resources at best, separated by hundreds of thousands of miles of empty space, the engineers of NASA pulled off a rescue mission with such real suspense that it was beyond the scope of an imaginative plot. Looking back at the reality of this historical event, it shines as one of our country's \\"finest hours.\\"<br /><br />The great acting and directing put us right there in the middle of the drama.
B003L77G06|5.0|This show is just the funniest ever.  I agree that if you can't laugh at this show, you should really up your medication.  We love watching it over again. Can't find more fun in front of the boob tube.
0307474712|5.0|Ever since I read the premise of this book, I wanted to dive right in and read this. Now that I've completed it, I applaud Nicholls for his storytelling twist - the lives of two great friends as shown through the same date, July 15, over a span of twenty years. I found this book entertaining and the two main characters, Emma and Dexter, well developed. The pace of the book was just right and the story was realistic. It takes talent to write dialogue found in this book. Emma was a lovable character, but I had issues with Dexter, not because he wasn't well developed as a character in the story, but because he was often not likable. I often wondered what Emma or any girl found in him. He was an alcoholic jerk for much of the book and only in the end, when he was settled with Emma, did I feel like he finally matured. And just when you think you've read the ending (very abrupt, by the way), Nicholls takes the reader back in time to the Emma and Dexter's first date and leaves you falling in love again.<br /><br />This is a story that mirrors life, for what is life but a series of relationships, some of which get complicated and stretch several decades. I look forward to seeing how the movie turns out.
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I was compelled to write a review because I really enjoyed Oprah's narration.  It is especially nice when I watch it with my son who is 5.  But, truthfully, even without my son I enjoy her tone and her silly (albeit scripted) commentary. Sometimes it is hard for me to understand British English, despite the fact that it is the original! Either narrator, though, this series is unparalleled.

B002WY65UQ|1.0|I seldom write negative reviews--I'd much rather rave about the movies and music that delight and surprise. The surprise here was that this movie is so bad that I was delighted to turn it off after twenty minutes and watch something worth a couple of hour of my life. I like silly humor (Rowan Atkinson in \\"Johnny English\\" and \\"The Thin Blue Line\\" comes to mind). This movie is silly, but it's difficult to see how it qualifies as humor.

B003TML0VO|3.0|Most of the 3 star reviews here get it right.  This isn't your typical Santana album.  The man's signature licks have been abandoned in favor of a more generic approach.  There's nothing distinctive in Santana's sound that tells the listener that THIS IS SANTANA channelling rock's greatest classics, because quite frankly (a) the repertoire here is somewhat uneven ( \\"Dance the Night Away\\" a \\"Greatest Guitar Classic\\"?? C'mon! )  and (b) the production is too straightahead and veers on soundalike in some cases.  Or what Simon Cowell would cry \\"Kara-oke night\\" - due to the arrangements and singers.<br /><br />Santana is most at home when he plays songs from his closest period contemporaries - i.e. the Doors' \\"Riders on the Storm\\" - (the first listen sounded a tad too fast, but I got used to it) or even the Beatles \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" - or \\"Little Wing\\" - the songs are slow enough for Santana to emit some feel.  But on power rockers like \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" - Santana becomes anonymous.  Chris Cornell's vocals are so compressed (as with many other tracks) that the feel of the songs become simply uninteresting.  Creating a more analogue feel or warmer sound would have helped immensely.<br /><br />So overall, the more discerning fans are going to find heaps to quibble about this effort.  It's never easy to better a classic like \\"Smoke on the Water\\" or \\"Back in Black\\" without sounding mildly redundant.  That's the real challenge that anyone - even Santana faces.  When he does something different, as in collaborating with Yo-yo Ma and India Aire, people sit up and listen.  When he works with Chris Daughtry on Def Leppard's \\"Photograph\\" - it's nice but adds nothing new to the song.  First time listeners may however be inspired to search out the original material, so who knows?<br /><br />Whatever the faults, the album will be listenable to the general public and may grow on you.  It's just not essential listening, and one wishes that Santana would've found better songs to work with.  Nothing wrong with most of the tracks, but some choices were unspectacular. The novelty of using different vocalists was a smart move, but then again, felt like a ploy from a recording company??<br /><br />When one listens to Santana, one expects much more than a straight cover version, and that's where \\"GUITAR HEAVEN\\" falls short.ing wrong with most of the tracks, but some choices were unspectacular.

031603438X|5.0|I read a lot, mostly international current affairs. But I do love KR.   I did not know what to expect, but I knew it would be interesting.  Turned out to be one of the best books that I have read.  I recommend it highly, a great read.
4770031246|5.0|For many non-Japanese who enjoy Japanese culture, especially the pop culture and have watched many anime series or drama series, or even read the manga, it is no surprise if you are curious about bento.  The way they are put together and how creative they are (as well as economical), it's no surprise that more people outside of Japan are catching bento fever and wanting to make bento at home.<br /><br />So, what is bento?  Think Japanese version of the school lunch but instead of a big thick lunchbox, there is creativity on the portions of what one eats and are typically set in a special container in which food is split.  There is no big bulky apples or bananas or a big sandwich, for the Japanese, you have your steam rice, egg, vegetables, meats, etc. and it all fits into a container.<br /><br />And it's no surprise that bento boxes have become popular outside of Japan.  People wanting to create economically cool bento boxes and who best to write about it than food blogger Makiko Itoh, owner of justhungry.com and justbento.com.<br /><br />Makiko has written \\"The Just Bento Cookbook: Everyday Lunches to Go\\" featuring 25 attractive bento menus and features more than 150 recipes which include the Sushi Roll Bento, the Chicken Karaage Bento but as it does feature Japanese style bentos, she also has a not-so-Japanese section which has a Summer Vegetable Casserole Beto and Every Loves a Pie Bento.<br /><br />And what is important is that Makiko doesn't focus on cuteness or for the sake of having cute bento, she writes with care about nutrition and has easy-to-read, concise instructions that go along with photos.<br /><br />For example, using the cover image (featured above), the photo is for \\"Chicken and Three-color Pepper Stir-fry Bento\\".  She shows you how to create the stir-fry with a recipe, plus how to make instant cabbage and cucumber pickles and blanched broccoli.  Also, information on how to prepare basic white rice.<br /><br />She also has a time line of how long it takes to create the dish as well.<br /><br />After you make the dish, she then features how to prepare the food and place it into a single-tier and two-tier box.<br /><br />So, these are easy-to-follow instructions.<br /><br />So, what about the rolled up egg?  How do they roll it up?  No problem, she has pictures on how she does it.<br /><br />What about the zig zagged vegetables?  No problem, she explains how to do it as well.<br /><br />And it's important to note that the ingredients featured on the Japanese recipes are ingredients you can find at your local grocery store.  Especially if you have an Asian grocery store nearby.  Granted, sesame salt or kabocha squash may not be at your local grocery store, but the goal is to improvise if you don't find some of these ingredients.<br /><br />Now, by using Makiko Itoh's \\"Just Bento Cookbook\\", you may be thinking...great, we got the recipe down, ingredients for the Japanese and non-Japanese dishes can be found but what about the actual bento box and equipment that Makiko uses.  Now, this is the cool part of the book where she actually showcases bento boxes and accessories and where you can purchase them.<br /><br />Itoh also goes into foods that can be refrigerated or frozen and for those who are not familiar with the Japanese ingredients, she also has a glossary at the end of the book.  So, for those who read and are not sure what \\"bonito flakes\\", \\"miso\\" or what \\"edamame\\" are... no problem, she explains what they are.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic book for those wanting to prepare bento dishes.  Sometimes blogs on how to prepare bento are hard to follow and Itoh recognizes the weaknesses of what others have tried to do and focuses on making the experience as easy as possible for those creating bento for the first time.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in making bento, I can easily say that \\"The Just Bento Cookbook: Everyday Lunches to Go\\" is perhaps the best book I have reviewed on bento thus far.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0446698342|5.0|I received this book very quickly. It was in great shape and not expensive at all. This book was definitely an attention grabber. I could not put it down!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I love this soundtrack!<br />Christina and Cher did an amazing job on this album!<br />I feel that this soundtrack does a justice to the film and still keeps in theme with the movie!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Excellent sound quality with excellent build quality.    Sound Quality  I typically hate the cheap sound of digitally processed stereo equipment but these head phones have such a great tone and warmth to there sound its incredible. I have a Sansui stereo from 1983 with to solid sony floor speakers that produce great movie theater like sound that I was not expecting the X41 headset to come close to in sound quality however it strides right along with it as far as tone and warmth the only difference is the 7.1 surround on the Turtle Beaches the only way you can improve the headset it to give it a 3-way EQ just for further fine tuning    As far as gaming goes with this headset I play a lot of Gears of War 2 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 and the experience is more immersive because of the 7.1 which is truly impressive.    Build Quality  This for me is what i was buying them for and hoping my expectations were exceeded. When I was unpacking this product two things came to mind and that was man these are light weight and wow they made these to last even with someone who is hard on there stuff.    The one gripe i have is the set up and whats needed is misleading when it comes to plugging this unit into the Xbox 360 it plugs into the new ones with out much work but if your using HDMI on the older fat models you either going to need to buy the hdmi optical adapter for the 360 or take the protective casing off your 360s av cable

B002ZG981E|2.0|First, let's start with the fact that Leo has gotten fat...I mean fat!  It shows in this movie.  Second, the story is such a maze, that you literally do not know if you are in the \\"here and now\\" or in an altered state...hence too many sub-plots.  Third, the story line is laughable at best and fourth, the only redeeming feature of this movie is Tom Hardy...who is excellent in his role. So, if you feel like taking a bad roller coaster ride where the effects tell the story, and the story is non-existent, than have it...this is your movie.  By the way, did I mention Leo has gotten FAT!
030745455X|5.0|I wasn't impressed with the first book of this trilogy.  200 pages in and Lisbeth (the girl the books about) was barely a blurb.  Thank god it picked up or I might not have made it far enough to finish that one let alone 2nd.<br /><br />I sampled the this 2nd book on my kindle and my first through was that it was at least starting with active movement in the characters and 200 pages of dull backstory.  So I decide to commmit to the 2nd book...The Girl Who Played with Fire.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  This book has constant movement that keeps you intrigued throughout.  It picks up a few months after the first but you don't feel you've left out anything. And hey, this one actually has the title character in it from beginning to end.<br /><br />I'm reading the 3rd and final one now.  It has started right where this book left off so it feels less like a new book and more like the story of this one continuing.<br /><br />If you can make it through the first one...this one is worth it.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|This is a very funny animated story. It is basically about 2 villians who are competing against each other to pull off the biggest caper. On one hand there is Gru (Steve Carell also of Date Night and the Office), who has constantly been made fun of by his mother (Julie Andrews), since he was a child. On the other side is a younger, more hip villian that goes by the name, Vector, this name is to relate the direction and magnitude of his exploits.<br /><br />As the story progresses it reminds me of 'Spy VS Spy' in the Mad Magazine, so the stage is set for the competition to progress to a whole new level.  One pleasant set of extras in the show was Gru's minions: these little yellow guys are very funny and entertaining, there is always a little side-show going on with them, and they add an extra fun factor to the movie.<br /><br />Gru needs for his greatest ever exploit the use of a shrinking ray gun, which Vector possesses. In order to get this gun, Gru decides to adopt 3 orphan girls, who will while selling cookies to Vector, facilitate the theft of this gun. However, Gru really has taken on much more of a challenge in these little girls than he expects.<br /><br />The movie is a very nice enjoyable family show that everyone can relate to and enjoy. Its plot has different dimensions and also contains emotional elements as well as a lot of action.
B002ZJCQT2|4.0|I'm a physics nerd wannabe.  I enjoy dogs.  I thought the author did a great job explaining the concepts.  And Emmy was entertaining.  I would give 5 stars but have to critique the Kindle version which contained no table of contents (inexcusable for non-free Kindle product).  And the Kindle version costs more than the hardcover.  I bought it anyway as I found the concept intriguing.  And I was rewarded with a nice read from an effective and funny educator.  But honestly, the publisher really dropped the ball for the e-reader crowd.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|The Only Difference between the Oringal Re-lease and re-Packged Is that Season 3 Orignal Has a Booklet of the epsodies and Re-Packged dosnt.

0439023483|5.0|This was an outstanding book. The action was perfectly paced and heartstopping. The characters were well drawn, complicated, and very human. The world is sketched bit by bit in a way that doesn't seemed forced at all, and it is a horrifying world indeed. I've been hearing that this and the second in the trilogy are fantastic and the third drops off. If it's half as good, it'll still be a great novel.
193413712X|3.0|Not real sure about this one..kind of leaves me stunned (stoned?) Picked it up and finished it within hours and it hasn't hit me yet to what it was about..maybe that life is what you make it? Or we all turn out to be crazy old people?  Should you read it? Eh..if your bored..If you have other stuff to read then choose that first.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This is one movie that keeps coming up in conversation and in my memory over and over again. In fact, it's probably one of the most memorable movies of all time. Everything about it is absolutely brilliant - the writing, directing, and acting are all just phenomenal. I just read the description of the film on Wikipedia, and after learning some of the history and historical context of the film, I can now even appreciate the humor even more, which I would not have thought possible.    Years ago I saw a car with the license plate \\"PLAN R\\", and even now, years later, that license plate still makes me smile and laugh.     The reason I looked the film up on Amazon is because I just realized that it's time to own a copy of this movie!
B001FB55MG|1.0|I ordered the movie on November 2 and its December 5th and i still DONT have the DVD. i dont know what it is, but i will never use this person again to buy items from. Thats the nicest of a review i could give without being rude.
031603438X|3.0|The book \\"Life\\" by Kieth Richard dispelled some of the misinformation that I had about the Rolling Stones.  Mick Jagger was the lead singer but the group was more of a collaborative effort of mainly Kieth Richards and Mick Jagger.  Drugs and alcohol played a big part in the middle years of this incredible groups history and as I know from personal experience you can really get off track playing with this kind of fire, pharmaceutical or otherwise.  I am sorry I am not a musician because he uses quite a few pieces of technical jargon about strings and frets etc and the only thing I can play is a CD player.  Overall, the book is about life, and not just Keith Richards, life in general. The women, the road trips, the relationships, the brother hood. Life.  Good book. I saw the Stones in Hong Kong in November of 2003. They were old then. But they were incredible. AWESOME.
B002DKGWSE|3.0|Any review of this remake by the film's original director is likely to include comparisons to the original. Considering the original budget, that was a better movie, especially for its time.      The remake changes a few plot aspects and creates a tighter script. The acting is more professional and the video quality is superb in comparison to the first movie. Inexplicably the audio seems actually worse in the new version. Some key lines are swallowed. Despite slightly more modern acting techniques and better overall sets, props, special effects, and cameras, this remake is a poor cousin to the original shocker. Gone are the effects of horror experienced by the girls as well as their marred innocence. As well, the events are curtailed a lot in the remake.  Maybe we don't need to see such nasty detail, but if we saw it in the first movie, we probably wanted to see it again or we would not be watching the new version.     Any attempt to explain or justify the actions of the killers should be lost on an audience. There is no reason for their behavior and it is ridiculous to try to delve into that aspect. The implausible story seemed almost an aside to the horror and action in the original. In the remake, even the unrated one, it appears the director was attempting to pacify the ratings committee to create a wider appeal for the movie. Unfortunately I am sure that did not happen. I am guessing more people still watch the original than the remake and I would guess most prefer the original to its slicker more modern version.      I would regret not seeing the original. I could have survived quite well with no remake or at least this particular remake.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is a truly fantastic movie. The people that do not like the movie are automatic Twilight Series Haters. They are not appreciating it solely due to all the hype that the movie receives. Needless to say, this is action-packed, a great love story, and a worth-while buy!

B001FBSMF8|5.0|Love Chris Cornell's voice! Who knew it would take Timberlake to push Chris Cornell into greatness? This cd is addicting I tell you! Listen to this cd with an open mind and you will love it. If you are expecting music that sounds like Audioslave or Soundgarden, you will be disappointed.
B004EI3ON4|3.0|Have to say it is just OK. Just can't go any higher than that even though it may get played often enough as background music while I hammer away at the keyboard while drawing door / window elevations. I don't dis-like it but can not say it is great by any means. My first thought was that this is all of the same stuff I hear on NPR all the time. Small parts of it keep giving me flashbacks to the \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" soundtrack!? Holy smokes, Flynn Lives is straight off of the \\"Last of the Mohicans\\"!
0061134007|1.0|Admittedly am in the minority per the reviews but in sync with at least a few others.         This book seems to suffer from an identity crisis.  The author periodically references multiple personality disorder. The book is a perfect example:  is it to document some history(WWII)? Detective fiction?  Or, a romance novel designated for the sub-teen set?   It has many elements of all.   I'd also assess at least 30 percent as page filler much of which is flashbacks.  That went on for every other chapter for way too long.  The novel is complete with the trite, \\"formula\\" gorgeous heroine who immediately falls \\"in love\\" with the detective as he does her.       In total the book is so predictable, it almost wasn't worth reading.   Per the interaction between the gorgeous female and our hero, Harry Hole, he states several times that he felt like a teenager.  The content and elements of their entire involvement reads exactly like that -- up to and including the end of the book.      This could hardly be called \\"a suspense thriller\\" .  The \\"who-done-it\\" was fairly evident mid-way though the book and became more so with each page.  Of course in the concluding pages, Harry arrives just in the nick of time to \\"save the day\\".   That element of the story required some 30-40 pages to describe in boring,endless detail including (as referenced by another reviewer) pages and pages of the villain's diary notes of still more flashbacks to explain his motives.    I bought the book used and was glad of it. How something like this could win such praises and awards is puzzling unless it's quite dated and has been revised for the English speaking market only recently.   That would explain a great deal of it.

0316098337|1.0|As a senior, I had the opportunity to pick from a variety of English courses. Because I am an avid reader, I chose Contemporary Bestsellers, a course that focuses on bestselling novels published in the last five to ten years.    Our teacher gave us the chance to organize our own curriculum; we got to decide what books to read.    And I have to say, the reviews I read for this (Prior to purchasing the book) are misleading. At best, I would only give \\"Room\\" one star.     The first 120 pages of the book seem more like a list of things the boy does each day than an actual story. Even for a five year old his grammar is horrible and unrealistic. To be honest, it was a struggle to make it past the first half of the book. Once Jack managed to escape, I thought things would get a little more interesting, and I was wrong.     At most, I would call this a last resort book, the kind of book you read when there's nothing else to pick up. My entire group disliked the book and had a difficult time getting through it without nodding off.    What it comes down to: It's boring, it sucks, and I would not recommend it for anyone.
B003S898SG|2.0|Rebirth and Aurora Consurgens were way much better, maybe the hiatus affected them a bit.  I'm sure the next one will be great
B002ZG9800|4.0|\\"I Love You Philip Morris\\" tells the real life story of Steven Jay Russell, who in 1998 received an unprecedented 144-year prison sentence for fraud, conning, impersonating, and multiple escapes from Houston's Harris County Jail. The film shows us sequences that seem utterly impossible, but in fact actually happened, which only goes to show that truth really is stranger than fiction. No, I will not describe them to you. Enjoying the film depends on the audience's reaction to Russell's actions. It's a little like a magician revealing his secrets; the trick itself is a lot of fun, but seeing what went into making the trick work can be quite fascinating, especially when you realize just how much effort goes into making something look simple. The apparent ease with which he executes his schemes is equally mind boggling.    Jim Carrey's portrayal of Russell is a delightful bag of contradictions. He's funny but touching, exaggerated but believable, contemptible but justified, caring but manipulative. There are times when it seems like he's thinking of no one other than himself, and there are other times when it's clear that he does what he does out of love. It's a daring, complex performance, and it's for reasons other than the fact that his character is gay; it establishes that Carrey is capable of something deeper than outlandish personalities and extreme physical comedy. His take on Russell is engaging, although it's not necessarily understandable. This isn't a criticism. Sometimes, it's preferable for audiences to figure out characters for themselves, for them to put their own spin on why certain people are they are way they are.    We're given a small glimpse of his childhood, in which he learns that he was adopted. We then flash forward to his early adult years; he's married to a woman who's a bit too religious and perhaps a little ignorant but sweet nonetheless, he has a delightful daughter, and he's the manager of a Texas food service company. But after survivinga car accident, he decides to live his life as an openly gay man, and he leaves his family behind for Miami. It's there he realizes that living a gay lifestyle is more expensive than his salary as a sales manager will allow. So he does what any man vowing to live authentically would do - he becomes a conman. After relatively simple schemes like feigning slips and falls in public places, he plunges headfirst into various types of fraud, including credit card, passport, and insurance. He even sells bad tomatoes.    Unfortunately, his crimes catch up with him, and he's arrested and sent to jail in Texas. He learns the ropes quickly; everything essentially boils down to a choice between paying someone off, learning how to fight, or giving someone oral sex. He knows who to talk to and where to guide someone should they need something. He spends all his free time in the library, where he reads nothing but law books. Into his life enters Philip Morris (Ewan McGregor), a soft spoken gay man who was tried and convicted for theft of service. He wants to see if there's a legal way to help an AIDS patient lying in the infirmary. Russell lies and tells Morris that he's a lawyer. The two immediately hit it off. Over the next few weeks, they form their own little slice of heaven in a jail cell, oblivious to the yard beatings and the cell searches.    At this point, I'm going to stop describing the plot, for I want you to be surprised by the lengths Russell will go to be with Morris. I will say that what the film, in its own offbeat way, is surprisingly sweet. Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's screenplay, based on Steve McVicker's book \\"I Love You Philip Morris: A True Story of Life, Love, and Prison Breaks,\\" reveals a delicate and finely crafted balancing act between humor and drama; it's funny, though it never resorts to desperate slapstick or gross-out vulgarities, and it's heartfelt, yet it steers clear of broad, contrived sentimentalism. It's bold and appealing - a romantic comedy that refuses to follow the rules of a romantic comedy.    Apart from Carrey and McGregor, I was pleasantly surprised by Leslie Mann, who appears briefly but is no less important as Russell's ex-wife, Debbie. Even after learning that he's gay, even after they get divorced, even after he gets sent to jail, the two remain on fairly good terms. This is amazing coming from a woman perpetually hung up on what the Lord does and does not intend to have happen. She believes that Russell is a man who doesn't know who he is and is always searching for something. I guess that makes sense. Why else would he be so reckless in his attempts at pretending to be what he isn't? Part of what makes \\"I Love You Philip Morris\\" such a good movie is that it presents Steven Jay Russell without forcing us towards any definite conclusions about him. True, he may be serving an unusually long jail sentence (in solitary confinement, no less), but you have to admit, he is a romantic.

B001VNB54A|5.0|I absolutely loved Band of Brothers so I anxious to get a hold of the Pacific. It absolutely lived up to my expectations. The story line, and accuracy of the production was dead on. I think Tom Hanks and his team really provided a realistic and eye opening view of what our boys went through. There were a few deviations from Sledge's book, but I am sure that that is hollywood.     Truly shows that this was the greatest generation.
0061353248|3.0|I recall as an economics student plaguing my lecturers and tutors with, 'yes, but people do not behave like this'.  I was also disappointed with my post-grad marketing course which focused on case studies of other people's ideas, rather than delving into the psychology of human behaviour, so I could find the buttons to push to Svengali-like, control my fellow man.  So I have been waiting for the 'dismal science' to 'get more real' for about 40 years!  Given this I greedily grabbed this book.  It is 'interesting' but with its pedestrian prose, did not set me on fire.  I ended up not particularly enlightened.  I guess I was again expecting a 'disclosure' of the deep inner recesses of the human psyche as our 'Svengali' author took us in hand.  I didn't get this.  Still it is good that economists are at last looking at the interaction of human psychology and the essential irrationality that drives most of us us (but not I).
0891419063|5.0|With the old Breed is one of my most cherished books. The son of a WWII vet I crave to understand what happened during that time. Mr. Sledge puts everything into perspective. His portrayal of the battles are real and not sensationalized. He does not present himself as a hero and shows the realities of war.<br /><br />Wonderful read that I could not put down.
031603438X|4.0|The Keith Richards autobiography is remarkable for the many things it is not. No doubt, this is a source of disappointment for many hoping to get a gossipy tell-all or an in-depth blow-by-blow account of every Stones recording session. It is clearly neither of those two things. Keith's breezy, often superficial accounting of his life skips over songwriting, lacks the day-to-day minutia of Bill Wyman's recounting, doesn't dish a whole lot of celebrity dirt, nor does it offer gritty details of the drug world that swirled around him for so, so long. It's more like how Liz Phair described it in her N.Y. Times review; it's like you had the rare chance to sit down with the guy, pour a couple of vodka and Sunkist orange, fire up a fattie or three, and listen to the old man tell tales. So much so in fact, that it reads as if it were transcribed grunt by grunt from the notoriously hard to understand Keef.<br />For Richards, songwriting is as much a mystery as a skill. He's long credited the cosmos for his songs e.g., wisps of brilliance pulled out of the air, that when he does take credit, he's an odd mix of humility and braggadocio. Guitar players won't get much insight save a quickie take on open G tuning, but there are scores of magazine articles devoted to his style. Moreover, he does not wrap his tale around recording sessions or tours as much as he haphazardly spills stories that seem to support common philosophical threads; enjoy life, cherish friends and family, stay loyal, only the strong survive, don't be an arsehole, and only use pharmaceutical dope. Life lessons ala The Soul Survivor.<br />Keith's story is truly his story, and as such, does not linger long on Jagger, Watts, Wyman, Woods, Taylor, or Brian Jones except as they pertain to Keith's history. Keith demonstrates his brotherly love for his musical spouse. Mick Jagger is \\"Brenda,\\" the maddening prima donna always searching for the next musical trend to convert to on one page, and a brilliant songwriter who just happens to be the greatest rock singer ever on another. Clearly, Keith's view is that he can make fun of or criticize Mick as much as he wishes but if someone else does, they will feel his knife-wielding wrath. Additionally, Keith's opinion of Jones has long been documented. If you've read any of the many other Stones' books out there, you'll find that Richard's account of what happened stays consistent with those others, i.e.; Brian Jones was a musically gifted but psychologically weak and insecure guy who fell in more with being a star and being adored than he did with making music. Once the juggernaut of Jagger/Richards got rolling, \\"his band\\" was gone. Keith may split hairs about the genesis of the band, but a stronger case for the Rolling Stones being Keith's band can be made than for it being Brian's, even back in the early days. Jones may have gathered the group together with his Elmore James mimicry and charm, but when push came to shove and the band had to decide whether to be a local cover band or write their own songs and shoot for the stars, it was Keith and Mick who rose to the top. Sadly, Brian felt betrayed by this and, instead of pushing himself to write and bring something to the band, he chose to fall into a downward spiral of drugs and whoring out his celebrity status. He may have resented The Glimmer Twins' ascent to power, but he was quite comfortable soaking up the media coverage and taking credit for the work of others. Furthermore, he became increasingly erratic and Keith was often left to carry the guitar load for what was supposed to be a two-guitar band. When the band was in the middle of the insanity of non-stop touring, Jones would take gigs off for \\"health reasons,\\" only to be found later out on the town hanging with those who would worship him. During what is generally regarded as the band's zenith, it was Keith and Keith alone playing guitar on most of the songs. Needless to say, Brian's drugged-out abandonment of the band, a sin against loyalty, left Keith unforgiving and cold-blooded about things. I can't blame the guy one bit.<br />\\"Life\\" is an entertaining if long read that probably could've used a bit more editing. It also bears mentioning that one needs to take things with more than a few grains of salt. Keith has long been known for embellishing his own image and one can almost see the winking smile on his weathered face as they read of his exploits dodging the law, juggling women, catching musical lightning in a bottle, or opining on the world of rock and roll excess that he defined like no other before or since. This isn't the history of The Rolling Stones but rather Keith's life story. Perhaps it's so refreshing and amusing for all that it is not. Keith has always come across as direct and pragmatic, much like the songs he writes. As his compositions are driven by comfortingly reliable trademark riffs; so his life has been a long example of similarly trusted virtues: loyalty, hard work, and knowing one's limitations.

0312427646|5.0|This short book by humorist and playwright Bennett is a delight. It celebrates reading as a universal activity with the Queen of England being initiated into the club by a lowly page who is an avid reader with surprising results for both.<br />A slim volume and a great gift.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This amp isn't the greatest thing, but it certainly does what you would expect it to do. My only gripe is that the battery dies without warning, cutting out the audio. I use the device for work, and this can be detrimental. It would be nice if there was some sort of an audio or visual cue to signal a low battery so I could charge it before it completely goes dead. The sound quality isn't what audiophiles would seek, but it provides more volume to headphones if that's what you're needing. I'm still satisfied using it daily.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have been following Josh's career since almost the beginning, but I'm not a hard core Grobanite.  I don't hang out on his website anymore or follow his every move like a desperate puppy.  I listen to his music with an open mind, just like I would any artist, and try to judge it on its own merits, without comparing it to what has come before.  I know it's hard to accept something different from an artist when you have grown to love their previous style so much.  I'm a huge Queen fan, and I remember how shocked I was when they released \\"Hot Space,\\" but I came to love it in time.  An artist wouldn't be an artist if they stayed in the same safe groove their entire career.  They have to branch out.    I don't think Josh has done anything shockingly different with this release, but he has changed and evolved in small, subtle ways.  I must confess, I really LIKE it.  That doesn't mean his earlier work wasn't good, this is just another side of his talent.      I personally find these songs so beautiful, they break my heart.  The arrangements are wonderful, with instruments used in ways one doesn't normally hear in this context, and Josh's voice in these songs - there are simply no words to describe it.  I love the deep richness and the expanded range - I think he is relying more on his baritone here and not trying so hard to be a tenor.  And contrary to what others have written, I think he has poured every ounce of passion he has into writing and singing these songs.  I can almost feel his yearning for something he hasn't found yet.  It makes me want to cry.  I'm still trying to decipher what all the lyrics mean, and I doubt my interpretations will be the same as his or anyone else's, but that doesn't really matter.  And I love the subtle Irish/Celtic/Bluegrass flavor of so many of the songs.  I'm not going to review each song individually, but there is something wonderful about every one of them.  There are none that I just don't want to listen to, like on some of his previous releases.  I'm really not a fan of the French language in song, but I can't bring myself to dislike that song either.    Again, this is an honest review.  I haven't listened to any of Josh's past music in quite a while, so maybe I'm able to be more open-minded with this release because I'm not comparing it so closely to what has come before.  But I think it's very good and I applaud Josh for not playing it safe and trying something new, regardless of what the fans might think.  He doesn't have anything to be ashamed of here.  This may be his \\"Hot Space,\\" an album that is loved more by his fans in 20 years than right now, but there's no doubt it's a work of quality and he should be proud.  I'm extremely proud of him and I hope he keeps branching out and reaching for excellence in his art.    Just listen to these songs without preconceptions and comparisons.  Put aside what YOU expect and want to hear and just listen as you would a new artist you hadn't heard before.  I think you will find much that is wonderful in this release, and those that criticize it now may come to love it as time goes on.  New music, as with new shoes, often requires a \\"breaking in\\" period before a listener can fully appreciate it, especially when that music is a departure from what the listener is expecting. Give this release the benefit of that breaking in period and I think you will find Josh doesn't let you down.    I would not hesitate to recommend this album to any music lover, either for themselves or as a gift.  I'll be giving it as a Christmas gift myself.
B000RZIGVS|3.0|If you're pondering ordering the complete series of Star Trek: The Next Generation, then you obviously know what the premise of the show is so let's go to the packaging.  The DVDs are placed into unlabeled trays which hold either one DVD or two DVDs (front & back).  These trays are unlabeled, divided into three groups rather than the seven seasons, and are held together by what appears to be a clear strip of packaging tape.  These three groups of trays are placed in a silver tray which is adequately sturdy.  The clear plastic cover that drops down over the trays, however, is far from sturdy.  The lid is reminiscent of the clear plastic one would find in disposable packaging.  Needless to say, the packaging left much to be desired.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|This is a really nice soundtrack effort by Daft punk. I have listened to some electronica albums by them and thought I would give this album a try. After a couple of listens I really like this fast paced soundtrack. Can't wait to watch with with the full movie in 3D. Thanks Amazon for a wonderful deal.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|This is an interesting documentary of the life of Robert McNamara.  I have used it for teaching a course in International Relations and American foreign policy to advanced high school students.  My students love it, and it really gets them talking about issues like the use of nuclear weapons, choice of targets in war (military or civilian), war crimes, etc.  If you are thinking of using it in class, check out the films official website ([...]) which includes lesson plans and lists of concepts that the film is useful for teaching.

B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I am a country fan so I've listened to a lot of country songs and she is my favorite female singer, next to Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, and Lady Antabellum. If you are reading this and you are going to look at the 1-4 star ratings STOP! This album should get a 5 star and nothing less. Not to mention  that she has talent and looks all in one beautiful package. Also all of Taylor's songs were writen from her own experences and feelings: Back to December really is about someone she hurt in December, Picture to Burn is about a guy who hurt her. Don't belive me check her web site. Also don't think her songs are only for girls of a young age because I'm a guy with a set of six pack abs that would blow your mind, and I listen to Taylor Swift songs all the time.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|Say what you say about Kanye's personal life but no one can deny that the man is a musical genius. With his fifth album, Kanye easily shrugs off any negavity from the last year. The singles POWER, Runaway, Monster have impacted the radio and the opening song Dark Fanasty has a lyric in it, that shows how much Kanye has grown lyrically. As for the short film it's a work of art.
031603438X|5.0|I saw a review by someone who hadn't read the book but trashed it based the sensationalist excerpts that are floating around (comments about Micks \\"equipment\\", etc). His complaint is it isn't candid or honest ... that it just panders to the legend as all RnR autobios do.     My response ... So what? Who cares? This book is entertaining. It's facinating. Keith does some self promotion, some preserving of the legend but he also speaks tirelessly and lovingly of the music, the people he played with and partied with over the years. He touches on the politics and trends of the times. It's history seen through the eyes of an adventurer. And it's funny.    I recommend the audiobook ... read in part by Johnny Depp and Keith himself. His love of the music is vivid and contagious. It makes me wish I hadn't stopped playing guitar, it brings back fond memories of my younger days listening to music and absorbing everything I could get my hands on. It makes me want to write and sing and play.    I love this man. Thank you Keith.
1439177783|5.0|This book was one of the most amazing story of a battle to gain control in your life against the odds that Portia lived with.  I never knew exactly how anorexia and bulimic would affect a person and what she did before she was able to win her battle. She is so lucky to have met Ellen who helped her even further.
B0043KK4N6|3.0|I wasn't too impressed with this CD.  I guess I had high expectations after seeing the movie; and those expectations weren't met.  Although I liked all of the songs in the theatre, it didn't have the same thrill when I listened to it in the car or in the house (and I have good systems in both).  The performances, at the movies, had a lot to do with it as well.  The only songs I care for on the CD are Express, Show Me How You Burlesque and Beautiful People.  The rest are ok but I could do without.
1590171993|5.0|I ordered \\"Stoner\\" after reading John Williams' masterful book, \\"Augustus\\".  The books could have been produced by two different authors--the writing is so different.  What the works have in common is that their characters are presented in ways that the reader is emotionally hooked and vested pretty much from the first chapters on.  The books also share a clarity of language that is rare.<br /><br />In \\"Stoner\\", we are presented with the fictional biography of a man (William Stoner) who would, by many definitions, be deemed a failure.  But in the end he isn't.  And throughout the chronicle of his life as a university professor and scholar, his considerable personal limitations, poorly informed decisions, lack of street smarts, etc. are not enough to obscure the curious nobility of the man.  Above all else, he is dedicated to the profession of teaching.  And in this context, he prevails against unpromising family origins, an unwise and very long lasting marriage, a general lack of professional ambition (other than to be a great teacher) and a vicious and unrelenting academic rival.  Stoner has moments of triumph and happiness--recognition of his unique teaching skills by his students and a rapturous love affair at mid-life--but they are oases in an otherwise difficult life.<br /><br />The quality of writing in this book is so good that you have to assume that \\"Stoner\\" must be often included in the curricula of modern literature classes.  Author Williams' use of descriptive narrative is close to peerless in 20th Century writing and his characters unmatched in effecting response from the reader.  With respect to the latter observation, you don't have to go further than the Amazon reviews of the book to see how strongly readers are touched by the story; much of this reaction is fiercely negative, but is rarely indifferent.<br /><br />A terrific, compelling book.  Highly recommended.
0312600844|1.0|I bought into the hype and bought the book. It's bad. Just bad. Embarrassingly bad, at some points. I can't add much beyond what the other negative reviewers already have written, but would simply say that I just finished Steinbeck's \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" (and have started \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\"), and it's striking--the contrast between quality writing and this crap.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I normally don't care for Daft Punk, but I am a huge Tron fan so I couldn't skip this. I have yet to see the film but just listening to the soundtrack has made me even more excited to, they even successfully made it feel like it would fit perfectly with the original movie.
0143039482|4.0|Having recently read the over-hyped \\"Freedom\\" by Jonathan Franzen, \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\" proved an excellent respite from all the drivel that's being passed off these days as modern masterworks. Steinbeck is amazing.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|i bought this after finding out that my man liked it and wanted it. so i didnt know till something was said. i did watch it. it was fairly good. lots of action with equal low points.
B00438BTJ6|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I was a little disappointed.  It was completely different than Foundation, and to me, it didn't have the ZBB sound.  I had spent the money though, and I was bound and determined to give it another listen, then another and another.<br /><br />Well, it's grown on me.  This is quintessential ZBB.  Probably 1/2 the songs on this album could be #1 sounds.  They are catchy, easy to sing along with, have great harmony, and and are well recorded.  The album has a mix of happy, uplifting songs, like Knee Deep with Jimmy Buffet.  At the same time, there are pensive songs, like Martin and Colder Weather.  Both of these are amazing songs that make you take pause with whatever you are doing.<br /><br />Remarkably, some of the best tracks are NOT available on the standard album.<br />Sweet Carolina - an amazing live tune that definitely makes you appreciate what you've got<br />Father and Son - a remake of a Cat Stevens tune, that Zac Brown does amazingly well.<br /><br />Overall, this album has shown that ZBB is here for the long haul.<br /><br />As a side note, if you get a chance to see them in concert, it is well worth the price of a concert ticket.
1423101499|3.0|Started reading these books when he found out about the movie coming out to theatres. He fell in love with them and this was the only thing he asked for as a birthday or christmas present for this year. I have all 5 and he won't know anything about them till he's surprised on the 18th and 25th of December. I also purchased the Demi God files that goes along with the series and he's got the movie too.
B003405MF6|5.0|Jeff Beck once again proves he is a master of fusion music, in that he melds together rock, jazz, in his interpretation of \\"I put a spell on you\\" with Joss Stone, show tunes with his version of \\"Over the rainbow\\", and his interpretation of the classic aria \\"Nessun Dorma\\" from La Boheme by Puccini gives me goose bumps. It seems that every album Jeff puts out is better than the last one. I can't wait until the next one!
0307266303|4.0|I read this book to have something to add in conversations with my wife on the topic of her sport. She is a cross country coach and has always enjoyed running for as long as I have known her. I am not a runner. I have raced a few 10Ks and burn calories on my local treadmill, but I don't enjoy running. However, I did enjoy this book.<br /><br />It follows a journalist's path to becoming a great runner by way of a tribe of natural athletes. He casts off the conventional wisdom and shoes of the Nikes of the world, exploring the world of barefoot running while training for super marathons with a cast of endearing characters. I found the links to humanity's past the most interesting, explaining how we may have evolved to be great runners. I highly recommend this book if you have any interest in moving quickly without a vehicle.
0802473156|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It seems like a simple idea yet so many of us don't know how to do it.  I think all couples should try and incorporate these ideals into their relationships.  It would certainly make for much happier relationships.  It shouldn't be a secret.
0061801313|1.0|I am sure this book is great for teens that are older - but after my 9 year old came home with this book, I read a few chapters and quickly discovered that this book talks about, sex, drugs, stealing alcohol from parents etc.  Not necessarily appropriate for a 9 year old.  Plenty of time to learn about that stuff later.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|At last the OST for \\"TRON: Legacy\\" has arrived, and, having anticipated it for quite some time, I can truly say that this work by far exceeds all my highest expectations. Taken as a whole, this soundtrack \\"fits\\" together nicely. It sounds like a logical flow from the same central idea (viz. the film) whilst still retaining diversity and differing, nuanced emotions. It is also obvious that, though it is true that there is a substantial orchestral component, Daft Punk was the guiding force behind this soundtrack's creation; indeed, the electronic music of traditional Daft Punk plus the more traditionally-scored analog orchestra do not disagree with each other or cancel each other out--rather, they complement one another, as (in my opinion) is proper for this project.<br /><br />In comparison with the original \\"TRON\\" score by Wendy Carlos, this too in my opinion nicely complements the original. In addition to showing some continuity nods to the original TRON (as John Green \\"Darkwriter\\" has meticulously and excellently pointed out in a previous review), the feel of the soundtrack is appropriate in its difference. The score to the 1982 film is replete with both synthesizers and traditional instruments, but the synthesizers had that '70s-'80s feel about them, which, combined with the imagery of the original \\"TRON\\", was quite apropos for its era and worked quite well (especially when considered in retrospect). The \\"TRON: Legacy\\" score achieves much the same for its era, but, thankfully, it does not forget its roots. The progression of the franchise evidences an expansion on similar themes, not a replacement: The stylistic underpinnings of the imagery and score have evolved considerably in the twenty-eight intervening years, but the aura exuded by the current project is obviously rooted in the expression of the original as opposed to burning it to the ground and starting anew.<br /><br />TL;DR: Superb album, and a worthy successor to the original.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|Maybe I had lower expectations than most others, but this box set was pretty much what I imagined. I only had TS1 and 2 on video before, so it was definitely a worthwhile purchase as I hadn't seen any special features etc. Also good for me since most blu-rays are way overpriced in Australia. There is a trilogy available at JB hi-fi in Australia (all 3 movies on blu-ray for $55 I think), but if you're after the DVD copies as well, this is probably the way to go. On that note, the NTSC region 1 DVDs work fine on my DVD player from Australia (not my old computer drive though) and the blu-rays work fine in my region B player. I could just have been fortunate though.    The kids definitely love the packaging, which looks pretty groovy. Just make sure you take care when handling the discs because they aren't really well protected. (wasn't a deal breaker for me, though some really loathe this packaging apparently)    So pretty much, the main advantage is that you get all 3 movies (3 different copies of each) pretty cheap in a cool looking box set. If you don't care for digital copies (or DVDs for that matter) and you want the case to fit in with the rest of your blu-ray library, then probably spend the extra few $$ on the 3 individual titles.
1400031001|4.0|Any Human Heart is the novel reframed in journal form with dates and indexes.The novel covers every decade of the 20th century.The title is ironical, as it is not just about `any human heart',as Logan Gonzago Mounstuart went to public school and Oxford,wrote novels,was a journalist,worked in an art gallery,was a spy,knew Hemingway, Virginia Woolf,Anthony Powell,Ian Fleming,the Abstract Expressionists,Picasso,the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.Any human heart?He talks all the time how life is about the balance of good and bad luck.     We also have his many love liaisons,marriages,children,step children.We cover many of the events of the 20th century,the Crash,2nd World War,Spanish Civil War,Biafran War,the Baader-Meinhoff Gang.He travels from Uruguay(where he was born), England,New York,Biafra,Switzerland,France.In some ways the novel covers an itinerary not unknown to William Boyd,the writer,if you look at his own biography,although this is not autobiography,but a way of hypothetically capturing the 20th century,in a way that Boyd was enthused to do so,through leading real time figures,to stitch in the narrative,to give its leading character some sustenance.     The novel captures the randomness of a person's life.There's no real plotting and you move from scene to scene in the random fashion of Mounstuart's life.However he largely avoids the 2nd World War by being a spy,going to Biarritz,Barbados,Switzerland,but he is incarcerated for 2 years in Switzerland.Although the love of his life is Freya,she dies in an air raid while he is abroad spying,so he spends little time with her.We don't get to see his love mature.His daughter and his son die early,so nothing of solidity to build a better picture.We get momentum.     His Catholicism appears to be dropped quite early.We have a novel of breadth rather than depth.I liked the account of his various publications,how they evolved, and his time as director of an art gallery in New York.He genuinely comes into his own when describing the various Abstract Expressionists,introducing his fake artist Alan Tate.He also manages to bring alive the Simpsons very well.Its strange that he doesn't talk about Orwell in his account of Spain,Hemingway suits his extrovert musings better,introducing Martha Gellhorn.     The book really comes into its own in the `2nd London Journal' and `The French Journal'where Boyd's description of failure,poverty and old age is extremely moving.Mounstuart is an interesting invention in the depiction of his sex drive,his aging from boy to old man and his experience of major events and personages of the 20th century.He is anchored through time by his relationship to Ben and Peter,his 2 main friends,showing their lives too.I found his involvement with SPK as well as the Simpsons implausible but good fun.The style is succinct,clear,cool and sensuous.An engaging,entertaining novel.I look forward to reading 'Restless' and 'The New Confessions'.
B0047O2HJW|5.0|Awesome packaging, with original LP sleeves and cover inserts. Killer sound. Save your $ on the CD version and invest on a turntable to properly appreciate these recordings. For $139.99, this was a great deal; just over $15 for each vinyl + you get a book as well.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I left this book sit for a few months before picking it up - much to my deep regret. The story almost takes a back seat to the character development while keeping the action steady. there are several surprises but none that come outside of what we know of the characters involved. Very well done.
0982743726|5.0|Walter Rhein's THE BONE SWORD takes you on an adventure that is fast-paced and action-packed from the first paragraph to the last. The characters are compelling and the story is entertaining, moving and gruesome all at the same time. Walter Rhein builds his world with such strong, descriptive language that it transports you to another place and time. This is definitely a fun book and I'm looking forward to reading the sequel.

I cannot figure out which disc this is on Amazon to purchase.  Netflix sends the cover art as \\"collector's edition\\", which does not exist in Blu Ray.  The reviews of Blu Ray Predator discs seem not to be the disc i just saw.  This would be the all time demo disc, if I knew what it was.

0385738757|2.0|I loved the first book in the series and eagerly awaited the sequel. The Scorch Trials was such a let down.  As I read, I kept wondering why the editor of this book let some of the similies and metaphors even get past the red pencil. I kept reading them aloud to anyone who would listen.  The first part of the book was not as coherent as the second part of the book. The second part of the book read much like the Maze Runners.  I really don't feel that the author fully explored the issues surrounding the control group and the experimental group. The new characters were thinly developed. I special ordered this book .... was greatly disappointed...not sure I will even bother with the next book.

Wide-eyed and innocent.    Cool water.    At the heart of this book, and flowing through all its pages, is Patti's enormous love for Robert. She loved him enough to let him go.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are legendary.  I got these because they were recommended by my teacher for sound engineering.  There are others a lot more expensive, i did not get to compare them, but I really don't need to, this works great.  You can hear everything, this is great for mixing or listening for errors in your music or just listening to music in general.  You will hear a lot of detail on these that you won't hear with other headphones or regular speakers.  It also slightly cancels the surrounding noise even though they are not noise canceling headphones.  They are not extremely bass heavy so if you boost the bass too much it will distort (but that's not what they're designed for anyways).  This is an all around great product, it does what it's designed to do.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|It's Daft Punk and it's the soundtrack to the new movie TRON: LEGACY.  It's a good soundtrack, but not a great one.  Parts are quite repetitive in sound and not very imaginative and others are total Tron like electronica with fantastic soundscapes.      On it's own, its a good effort, with what I can see via clips it looks like an excellent support for the action.  But sadly when compared to the original TRON soundtrack by the father/mother of electronic music Wendy Carlos it pales mostly.  The few standouts are THE GAME HAS CHANGED, END OF LINE, FALL, RECTIFIER, SEA OF SIMULATION and the almost homage to Ms. Carlos; ADAGIO FOR TRON.      Still it's worth buying if you are a Tron fan like me, but I would have loved to see what would Wendy write for Legacy had he been asked to.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet. This album is awsome. There isn't a song on it I don't like. I am looking forward to the movie even more now that I have heard the soundtrack.

The biggest problem is the belt clip is on the top of the unit so if the bottom comes off (which it has a number of times) your iPod goes crashing to the ground unprotected.  I put a piece of tape in the inside to stop that from happening.  This works, but since you have to remove the iPod from the case if you use most; headsets,adapters,charger,or speakers... that isn't a great solution.
B004259BMM|3.0|I am a die hard Keith Urban fan. I have every single album that man created.  My all time favorites are \\"Golden Road\\" and now \\"Defying Gravity\\".  I have to say I was disappointed in this CD. The entire album is tribute songs to his wife which is very, very nice.  However it lacked his extraordinary guitar playing ability and savvy vocals. I know most folks find it very good but I find it lacking \\"Keith\\".  I am a fan, will always be a fan and will always buy his work regardless!  He is one of the best recording artist across all genres.  Sorry Keith it just didn't grab me like your other work has :-)
B00004ZAV3|5.0|One issue that comes up every time that a compilation album comes out is why some songs were left out while others get included. On this album, there's little if any room for argument; the criteria is that each song was #1 in either Britain, the US or both. So, as much as I'd like to hear other favorite Beatles songs here, the point (aside from making money on sales, of course) was to highlight the highest-charting singles from the Fab Four.<br /><br />OK, now with that issue out of the way, onward. Thanks to the shorter song times from back in the early days of recorded music, a lot of older songs can fit on a CD. Thanks to the large number of top-of-the-chart tunes that the Beatles earned, there are a lot of their early #1 songs to put on a CD without \\"fudging\\" things a little. So this one disc provides a lot of proverbial \\"bang for the buck.\\" The songs on this disc are set in chronological order so that you can listen to the band evolve their style over time. And last but by no means least, the recording quality is very good. (As an aside, I become really impressed with how well older songs have been remastered lately for both CD and digital download formats. Most folks seem to be doing their homework quite well in this area, but there are exceptions still. And a lot of older and less well done collections are still floating around.)<br /><br />So after all is said and done, I can confidently state that this is a pretty good collection for anybody who, for whatever reason, has been looking for a one-source compilation of songs by the Beatles.
1442337966|5.0|It is the perfect sequel to \\"The Secret\\" but more powerful and with more precise instructions on how to integrate The Law of Attraction into your life.  I read the book twice and then bought the audio version to listen to in the car. I recommend it strongly, it will take stress and  anxiety out of your life and teach you how to address and control constant worries and negative thoughts and replace them with a more positive outlook.  Not to mention the making of your dreams!!

B0035F0MTG|5.0|Ms Wang plays with a swiftness and a crispness ( a separation of the fingers) that surpasses Lang Lang, Litsia, Horowitz- possibly not Rachmaninoff; no one could criticize her although I'll bet some will for unfeeling of mechanicalness (did I just coin a word)- even though the pieces she plays on this cd require that- they are fiendishly difficult and do not lie easily under the fingers...the Brahms is the best version I have heard.
0141036257|4.0|By looking at groups of successful people in various fields such as sports, business, legal profession, the author comes up with startling conclusions. His research can be useful for parents and young people in choosing where to focus their attention. As an older person, I can recommend it as a good read and passing it on to the younger generations.
B00006FDCD|4.0|The movie IT, can make you want to cringe, especially if you have one of those Clown Phobias.  Oh, Pennywise is cute, at first, then shows his terrifing side.  He plays on peoples fears, fears from childhood, that some may not quite get over.  Great movie, was originally a mini-series on TV, great to watch sraight through, without all those pesty commercial breaks. Mr. King, at his best.
0525423273|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. The characters are likeable, flawed and real. I felt myself rooting for different characters and feeling conflicted when they didn't get what they wanted. The author really captures the CRUSH, the wondering if the boy likes you, daydreaming about the boy, and being unable to articulate how you feel. Halfway through, I was absolutely invested in the ending. I cared about the characters and what happened to them, because the author makes them so relatable.  It's a dreamy teen romance, but relateable to older adults, and chaste enough for younger ones.
0307474275|5.0|Bottom-Line: Anyone with an interest in religious history should enjoy this book, as well as those who enjoy a challenge for their brain<br /><br />I am not a religious man; truth be told I am an agnostic, a man of logic, reason, and a tad too many questions about the whole God thing for most religious folk to answer.  Organized religion is not for me, there has been and continues to be far to much suffering in the name of God, and far too much hypocrisy at the hands of those we should trust to live virtuous lives.  That I view religious institutions as those set up to control the masses.  But at the same time I am not ready to give up on the idea that there is a higher being responsible for all that we see, and all that we are under the stars.<br /><br />The being said, the search for the mythical Holy Grail, that cup of life Jesus Christ and his followers are said to have drunk from at the last supper, has intrigued me for a very long time from a purely historical standpoint.  \\"According to tradition, Joseph of Arimathea kept the Grail after the Last Supper and collected Jesus' blood in it when Jesus was crucified. After being conveyed to Britain, the vessel was passed down from generation to generation in Joseph's family. The Grail supposedly possessed many miraculous properties. It could furnish food for those without sin, and it could blind the impure of heart and strike mute the irreverent who came into its presence\\"...Microsoft Encarta Reference Library 2005.<br /><br />The Holy Grail has been the subject of legend since the crucifixion of Jesus Christ some 2005 years ago.  For the faithful it holds enormous meaning, but for those of us on the edge of belief, it is more of a curiosity then anything else.  Legend tells of course that the Holy Grail is a chalice, but in his controversial new book \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" author Dan Brown explores another meaning; that the Holy Grail is actually a collection of writings (Gospels) that prove Jesus Christ was a mere mortal, a child of God like the rest of us as opposed to the Son of God's flesh as the world was always led to believe.  Not only that, but Mary Magdalene far from being a prostitute was the chosen companion (wife) of Jesus Christ and that the two had a child together.  He also asserts that Jesus' bloodline survives to this day, a living, breathing testament to Herald's mortality.<br /><br />But wait, there is more: Brown avows The New Testament of the Holy Bible is a re-telling of Christian history commissioned by the Roman Emperor Constantine (the first Roman ruler to covert to the new religion) when he presided over the first ecumenical council of the church at Nicaea in 325.  The purpose of the New Testament was to elevate Jesus from mere mortal to the Son of God in an effort to unite the Empire under one spiritual conviction, and in the process fuse Pagan symbols with Christian faith, creating one Catholic faith for all to follow.  The Holy Grail as Dan Brown tells it in \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" is a collection of religious writing about the life of Jesus that were left out of the New Testament; again proving that Jesus, though a righteous man, was just a man, nothing more.<br /><br />It is a historical fact that there were as many as 50 Gospels in circulation at the time the New Testament was written and that only 27 made it into the New Testament of the Holy Bible.  What happened the other 23 and what did they have to say about the life and times of Jesus?<br /><br />Of course \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a novel, a work of fiction, but with a lot of facts woven into the tightly written text for effect.  Enough factual material is contained in the book to earn the ire of the Catholic Church and the Catholic organization, know as Opus Dei, both of which are portrayed as less than pious with the book.<br /><br />The Plot<br /><br />The renowned curator of the famed Louvre Art Museum in Paris France, Jacques Sauniere is dead, slain by a single assassins bullet to the stomach.  But before he died, he left a number of intriguing clues to a closely guarded secret he and four other men (also slain the same night) were the guardians of.  The clues can only be deciphered by his Grand daughter, Sophie Neveu a cryptologist with the French Judicial Police, and a renowned professor of Religious Symbology Robert Langdon, who teaches at Harvard University and in Paris to give a lecture and slide show \\"about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of Chartres Cathedral...\\"<br /><br />After Jacques Sauniere's is found dead a captain of the France's Direction Centrale Police Judiciaire, one Bezu Fache, is called in to investigate.  He sends his able right hand Lieutenant Jerome Collet over to the Ritz Hotel in the middle of the night to collect Langdon to help explain the clues Jacques Sauniere has left, or so he says.<br /><br />Sophie Neveu, understands some clues in the from of codes, puzzle boxes, and poems her Grand-pere (Grandfather) has left behind, and together with Langdon, who lends his knowledge to her own, she traverses Paris, London and finally Glasgow in a search for the Holy Grail's final resting place.  Along the way we are treated to quite a history lesson.  We learn for instance that Sauniere was the Grand Master of an ages old secret religious society that was formed to protect the Holy Grail and the heirs of Jesus from the Church since the 12th century.  The secret society called the Priory of Sion, which Sir Isaac Newton and Leonardo Da Vinci were members, is a real organization.  As are the places Langdon and Sophie visit in search of clues to the Holy Grail's location.<br /><br />Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is not the search for the Holy Grail, but the fascinating, and oft eye-opening journey into human history I was treated to along the way.  In writing the \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" Dan Brown did a fair amount of detailed research and it shows in the pages of his book.  The book is rich in historical and artistic detail; his descriptions of the churches and other places Langdon and Sophie visited left me wanting for more; so much so, that I was compelled to do my own research into people, places, and things mentioned in the book, in order to satisfy my own need to know.<br /><br />In the end, \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" became an obsession, a book I couldn't put down because it intrigued me so.  It is a brain teaser, a book that engages the mind in a quest to figure out the codes before the characters do, and it fueled my hunger to know more about the often shrouded past of the Catholic Church, and ultimately the Holy Grail itself.

B003TXSF5C|4.0|OK the math is not there as others have mentioned. No matter I wouldn't understand it anyway.      It has also been noted that Hawking has only chosen the physics that lead to this conclusion.  All others get no mention.    The end result is an interesting study in physics. But leaves us having to  accept the  things mysterious, just as trying to understand God.  This could be the Old Testament of physics. At least he hasn't asked us to write it Physics.
1582406723|5.0|I picked this book up after a friend told me it was being made into a television show. I didn't know what to expect out of it but for $10 I had nothing to lose. It is now one of my favorite series and I am on volume 8 of the trades. For how cheap this book is, it is definitely worth picking up. This series continuously brings new stuff to the table and never seems to get stale. The writing is very creative and I have yet to read a bad volume of The Walking Dead.    This opening volume is great from open to finish, and is probably one of my favorites as hard as that is to pick out in this series. It throws the reader right into the fire and is a page turner all the way through. This is a book that can easily be read in one sitting.

B00448SE4S|1.0|Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, what does one say about this film other than: \\"That which has been seen cannot be unseen\\"?  Because, trust me, I have been trying for the last 24 hours and it's not working.<br /><br />Every now and then in one's life they are confronted with something that is to mystifyingly odd that they feel like they have been forced back into the cluelessness of adolescence.  I suspect (and hope) that this was the overall message that everyone in this film intended; because if it wasn't, then I think each and every one of them is guilty of the crime of oxygen theft and aggravated intellectual assault.<br /><br />I sat through this film cringing as if I was stuck in some teenaged boy's wet dream sans the moisture.  I kept waiting for it to rejoin reality and make sense on some primitive level, but it never happened.  What I was left with was a miasma produced by the  melding of such travesties as `Donnie Darko' , `Napoleon Dynamite', and `Gymkata', with a really bad remake of `Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.<br /><br />In short, I want my 112 minutes back and for the people responsible for this to be launched from a trebuchet into the cauldron of an active volcano.  I cannot believe anyone with more than two synapses firing could like this movie.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|I wish you could return DVD's you have already opened cause this would go right back to the store, Beyonce is one of the worst actors I have ever seen right up there with J-Lo and Paris Hilton, I mean come on the only reason why she is in the movie is because she is one of the Executive producers along with her father. If you look at the credits she's the only one who has her very own makeup artist, dresser and hair stylist. She needs to stick to a microphone and leave the acting to the profesionals, money can buy a lot of things but I dont think there is any amount of money that can buy Beyonce an acting career, hopefully this was a learning experience for her. Ali Larter's performance was a little to dramatic but not over played with the one liners as Beyonce. Over all I would like the $16 I spent back on this as well as the 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life back.

B00000D9TQ|5.0|I may be the laughing stock of all my `same age friends', but I have a total `thing' for Phil Collins.  I think he's kind of brilliant, and this `Hits' album is a perfect example as to why.  I mean, in an age where every artist under the sun desires to be universal and refuses to be pigeonholed to the point where they will step outside their comfort zone and dabble in genres that only make them look foolish, it's a refreshing thing to listen to an artist who can, in a way, do anything.<br /><br />Yes, `Against All Odds' is like one of my favorite songs ever.<br /><br />But the true colors of Phil Collins can be seen, to ridiculously successful lengths, on his more upbeat numbers.  In fact, over half the album relishes in that groovy atmosphere created by the luscious sounds of `Easy Lover' and `Something Happened on the Way to Heaven'.  `Easy Lover' is just so catchy and so effortless in texture and tone.  The `snap your fingers' beat to `You Can't Hurry Love' and even `Two Hearts' bring the entire era to your living room and just make you want to dance.  And who doesn't just melt every time `Sussudio' comes on?!?<br /><br />There aren't many `white boys' who can call to mind the 80's nostalgia of Michael Jackson and Whitney Houston whilst remaining completely true to himself.<br /><br />And then there are the ballads.<br /><br />`Another Day In Paradise' is classic Collins, and the beautiful duet with Marilyn Martin (`Separate Lives') is just a soul stunner.  They complement one another gloriously.  I also love the simplicity within `A Groovy Kind Of Love'; it just hits all the right notes.  The closing track, `Take Me Home', is also a nice way to go out; soft and subtle and memorable.<br /><br />`True Colors' is one of those songs that has been done and redone and sampled and exploited in grotesque ways, but Collins take will always be the very, very best.<br /><br />I'm weird like this, but `In the Air Tonight' is just NOT one of my favorites.  I know, I know, don't take that wrong, for it is a good song, but I just never understood the hype.  Outside of the controversy within the subject matter, the song is a tad bland for my tastes.  `I Wish It Would Rain Down' almost gets it, but it comes off a little anti-climactic, and this song needed a little oomph in the end to make it really sparkle.  `Dance Into The Light' is fun and lighthearted, but compared to the better `upbeat' tracks on the album, it comes off a tad silly and `cruise ship like'.<br /><br />So that just leaves the eternally bland `One More Night' and the Bob Dylanesque `Both Sides of the Story', which is just overly long and underwhelming.<br /><br />Alas, not album is perfect, but in all honesty, `Hits' is pretty darn close.  I mean, sure, I squawked at like four or five tracks (only two of which I really don't like), but there are sixteen on this album.<br /><br />Solid A, no doubt!<br /><br />For those interested, my personal ranking:<br /><br />1) Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)<br />2) Easy Lover<br />3) Something Happened on the Way to Heaven<br />4) Separate Lives<br />5) You Can't Hurry Love<br />6) True Colors<br />7) Sussudio<br />8) Two Hearts<br />9) Another Day in Paradise<br />10) A Groovy Kind of Love<br />11) Take Me Home<br />12) I Wish It Would Rain Down<br />13) In the Air Tonight<br />14) Dance Into the Light<br />15) One More Night<br />16) Both Sides of the Storynever understood the hype.

B003YK42LQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This album does sound good. It just all sounds the same. The cover artwork fits very well, because the whole album all sounds very chill and smooth. And if you've been a fan of KOL for a while, you probably love their old school, grittier rock sound--\\"Happy Alone,\\" \\"California Waiting,\\" \\"Holy Roller Novocaine,\\" \\"Pistol of Fire,\\" \\"Razz,\\" \\"Charmer,\\" \\"Black Thumbnail,\\" and my personal favorite \\"Four Kicks.\\" Well, don't expect any of that sound on this album. You can hear very little of their older sound anywhere in this album.    There are two exceptions to the variety issue (\\"Mary,\\" an awkwardly doo wop sounding song, and \\"Back Down South,\\" a unapologetically countrified song), but neither one quite fits right. I know I sound contradictory--\\"It's not diverse enough! The diverse tracks don't belong!\\"--but there's a difference between a different sounding song that contributes to the sound and feel of the album, and one that just feels weird. It's like painting one wall of your living room a different color. If it looks right, it's called an accent color. If it doesn't look right, it's called a clashing color. These two songs \\"Mary\\" and \\"Back Down South\\" are clashing colors.    Again, I need to reiterate, this is not a bad album. It actually sounds very good. It's enjoyable to listen to. And I think that's the problem. It's just enjoyable to listen to. The previous albums that KOL have put out I would end up craving. I'd listen to them all day in the office and then couldn't wait to get out to the car so I could blast them through the speakers. This one though, I listen to it, I enjoy it, and when it's over I move on to something else.    In short, it's good, but it's not to the caliber that I have come to expect from Kings of Leon.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These are great headphones I have a Panasonic Theater setup w/ tv and it was a streamline hook-up process. As soon as I got them I hooked them up to my system and went Live. All the expectations were met. The only downside is that my ears heat up after one 5-minute match. Resolution = put them around my neck in between matches. Definitely  a must buy if you take your electronics seriously.

0061997811|5.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I have read each book numerous times. I own all of the movies, and have watched them several times each. I check my favorite Harry Potter news site-The Leaky Cauldron-daily for all the latest stories on the fandom. This led me to believe that I knew a good deal about the behind-the-scenes going on in the movies. Harry Potter Film Wizardry quickly made me realize I was wrong.      The first thing I noticed when opening the book was the amazing graphics. Flipping through the pages leads to many beautiful eye-catching pictures, text, and maps. Upon opening the book, I immediately flipped through it and soaked in all the images. This allowed me to check out the book's layout. Each section represents a different Harry Potter movie. In each chapter you will find \\"A Production Designer's Notebook and Producer's Diary,\\" with sections that describe various characters, locations, or creatures from that movie.    A great example of the layout can be see when looking at the chapter which discuses Goblet of Fire. This section contains information on the Quidditch World Cup (QWC), Miranda Richardson's portrayal of Rita Skeeter, and the Dark Mark. The pages containing information about the QWC contain an extra pull-out section; something that can be found throughout the book. In this case the bonus material is a program from the Quibbler. Other extras include a Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes product catalog and Marauder's Map.       Review: I found this book to be a readable version of the DVD extras. The format allowed me to take in the images and text at a leisurely pace. The text held details that even I-a rabid Harry Potter fan-didn't know. I thought this book was very informative and entertaining. I recommend it as a must-read for fans of the Harry Potter books and movies.
B0044XV3QY|4.0|Has anyone else noticed that this movie is Ferngully? I mean, it's almost exactly the same movie.

B004498KPU|1.0|I have all the Michael Jackson DVDs at home. I've always been disappointed with the sound and picture quality. I am sad to see that this box set is on DVD and not remastered for bluray. I am also disappointed that it is in 2 channel stereo and not even DTS 5.1. I am definitely giving this one a skip. Been disappointed too many times and behind the pretty wrapping, I can see that this is exactly the same as the previous bad releases. Please remaster this material! I would rather download the youtube videos. it'll probably be around the same quality. So disappointed because this would've made the perfect gift on bluray :(
0553805371|1.0|I saw the Larry King \\"interview\\" with Hawking (et al) and rushed right out (to Amazon.com) to buy this book.<br />What a disappointment.  It is as if Hawking ran out of gas.  I suspect the real problem with this book is the co-writer.  This book is all style and no substance.  There are no new ideas and the \\"Grand Design\\" is, apparently, a model including the flotsom and jetsom of the various theories of physics.<br /><br />I think this book's greatest strength is its accidental slamming of Science and Atheism.  Philosophy is dead?  Perhaps you gentlemen were thinking Pop Physics.<br /><br />Again I am compelled to comment: As they say in Texas, El Paso.
0375507256|3.0|\\"Cloud Atlas\\" contains several stories, though none of them are particularly interesting.  What I did find interesting about the book was the way the stories were put together.  They were all loosely related though they spanned the globe and spanned centuries.    David Mitchell is a tremendously talented storyteller as he takes the reader around the world, from the past, to the present and even into a science fictional future and then back again.  I almost got the impression that the author wrote this book just to showcase his talents.  Though all the stories are well written I did not find any of them compelling. I found \\"Cloud  Atlas\\" easy to put down.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|We have given this film a low rating for many reasons listed as follows:     Historically inaccurate     Excessive profanity   My husband was in the 2nd Marine Division, participating in five assault landings, and found the depiction of the Marines to be insulting.  Militarily the depiction of an offense did not seem possible. He doesn't believe that they  could make an advance being so closely grouped together. He wondered where the 1st Division obtained the dress blues they wore in several scenes, since dress blues were not issued during the entire war.      We could go on at greater length, but you get the idea.  This was a great disappointment.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I've been reading the \\"Walking Dead\\" series for several years and was pleased to hear that it had been adapted for TV.  Like the comic, the show focusses on the emotional impact of the zombie plague on the human survivors... There is some violence, and some gory gross-out stuff, but for the most part the zombie \\"walkers\\" are in the background, an ever-present, overwhelming danger but not the main focus of the drama.  There is already some plot divergence from the books, and I'm still waiting for some of my favorite characters to show up... But for the most part, this is a satisfying, suspenseful zombie epic, and is a nice compliment to the original graphic novels.  I'm looking forward to seeing where they take it from here... So far, so good!  (Joe Sixpack)<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />POSTSCRIPT: After Season Two came out (which totally rocks!) I went back and watched this season again, this time on the DVD release. I really was surprised to find that the DVD edition _edited out_ the gruesome, graphic sequence in the episode \\"Guts\\" in which the Rick and Glenn chop up a zombie corpse and coat themselves in its gore and viscera in order to \\"pass\\" as zombies themselves in order to escape a zombie herd. It's one of the most genuinely horrifying scenes in a zombie show that goes to great pains to elevate itself from being a mere splatterfest, but it's also one of the greatest dramatic successes of Season One -- it's a horrible scene which really makes the stakes of survival feel visceral and real. Editing it out was lame. The third disc of bonus features also deserves some comment: the \\"black and white\\" version of Episode One seems pointless, and doesn't really look that good. (Whatever.) But the \\"making of\\" featurettes are fun... Overall, I found the DVD release to be more enjoyable than the streaming video I bought when the show was new - no buffering issues or visual jumps. But the decision to edit gross stuff out seems pretty bizarre, if you ask me.e decision to edit gross stuff out seems pretty bizarre, if you ask me.
B004EI3ON4|1.0|I downloaded this and listened to it on the way to work this morning. I was very disappointed at how \\"generic movie score\\" it sounded to me. There were a few techno elements in the songs and a couple of songs have Daft Punk-style introductions. But, I really thought that this movie score was going to be something special given that the Daft Punk boys created it. It sounded more like Hans Zimmer with a modicum of added techno flair.    Daft Punk really missed an opportunity at making something new and great for a movie, like they did for music in general.    I am a very disappointed fan.
B003YOEXUM|2.0|I do not feel that this album is as good as some of their earlier albums i.e Metal Heart and Balls to the Wall. The lead singer's vocals on those two albums is truly amazing.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|If somebody told me I would ever like a band with a banjo in it I would have slapped them in the face with a leather glove!  I can't believe how much I love this album.  Very catchy instrumentation, amazing voice, changes in tempo within songs so they all sound like multiple songs in one, and lyrics with spiritual undertones similar to U2.  What more could you ask for?

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I have been awaiting this soundtrack eagerly, first as a HUGE Daft Punk fan, and second as a big fan of TRON. I am more than elated with this whole album, and am very surprised at the amazing amount of depth and subtlety that Daft Punk has worked into these compositions, as well as exploring and utilizing vast tonal palette like they never have before. I was not expecting this!     Of course, according to the CD booklet, they have been working on this project for about three and a half years. So you can tell that they are bringing their craft to a completely new level.    Great album, and hopefully, a great movie!    P.S. - Don't miss the awesome track \\"End of the line!\\" So good!

0525951652|2.0|Let me preface my review by saying that Ken Follett is on the short list of authors whose books I read without question. After reading \\"Eye of the Needle\\" in highschool, I read all I could find as fast as I possibly could.  For every new release since getting caught up, I have traditionally read within a month of the release.<br /><br />It took me 2.5 weeks to read \\"Fall of Giants\\".  That's about 13 days longer than a usual KF volume.  Unfortunately, the about the same as \\"World without End\\".<br /><br />WWE and FoG are strike 1 and 2 respectively.  I will probably read the sequel to FoG, but if that's strike 3, KF will fall of my short list.<br /><br />Regarding FoG specifically, my impression after reading is that it was, in order:<br />a) a history textook;<br />b) social and political commentary<br />c) a story.<br /><br />A fantastic historical novel has to concentrate on the story first and all else as secondary.  It is very possible to write in such a way (see Cornwell, Bernard).  Unfortunately, in FoG, KF has failed.  What's even more disappointing is that we all know how well he can write a historical novel.  Who knows what has caused the decline.<br /><br />I must state here, to be fair, that I thoroughly enjoyed the historical facts communicated in this novel.  WW1 was an era of history about which I knew relatively little.  Every night after reading, I found myself going to wikipedia and other WW1 websites to supplement my knowledge of the era.  So I must commend KF on his compilation of hte facts, which (for the most part) are accurate, when compared with the sources readily available on the internet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't open a KF novel to learn.  I open it to be entertained and to be sucked into the story.  Perhaps my expectations are too high.<br /><br />I expect complex characters, who through his writing either love and cheer on, or hate and wish evil upon.<br />I expect fascinating storylines and interpersonal conflicts<br />And I expect page-turning drama.<br /><br />Instead, I was \\"treated\\" to 1 dimentional characters who caused no emotional response.  I really wanted to like and cheer for the Williams children but found myself yawning.  I really wanted to hate Otto and Fitz and the \\"ruling classes\\", but...yawn.  KF usually illicits much stronger and more profound reactions to his characters.<br /><br />The storylines while mostly independent were forcefully (with a sledgehammer) interwoven such that the coincidences and the overlaps were predictable and without effect.  The battle lines I expected were (not to over use the word) forced.<br /><br />This all resulted in a blase and flat story.<br /><br />Maybe it's time to lower my expectations of a Ken Follett novel.<br /><br />My rating 2/5.characters who caused no emotional response.

B00428ZRFE|4.0|I'll admit when i first popped Rihanna's new album \\"Loud\\" into my player I was disappointed. Initially, the only two songs I liked were \\"Whats my name\\" and \\"California King Bed\\". However, the second time I listened to it,I found myself walkin around humming the tunes to some of her other songs. The more I listen to this album, the more I like it. Unlike her 4th CD \\"Rated R\\" which was a bit dark and edgy, Rihanna's \\"LOud\\" is a lot more upbeat and fun. I particularly like \\"Fading\\", \\"Rainin Men\\" and \\"LOve the way you lie part 2\\"... I'm dancin and singin so much when I listen to this album in my car that other drivers are probably tryin to figure out what I'm listenin to. All in all, is this Rihanna's best album? I don't think so but its definitely worth buying.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|Love this movie and while the blu-ray is best enjoyed with current flicks and digital technology, it still looks much better than I had expected. Worthy purchase.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|It's not often that I sit down and write a review for an album, but for this one I feel I must. It's rare that I have such an emotional reaction to an album, where not only do I feel like the lyrics are speaking to me, but also the music. Oh, the music. It's incredible. There is not one song where I feel tempted to skip over it.<br /><br />Basically, buy this album. I don't care who you are. Give it a listen. You'll feel something, I promise.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|As it seems to be often said, I wish there were a difference between the movie itself and specific versions. In this case, I would rate the movie itself as five stars!        But...there are some drawbacks to this edition. I own the Platinum Edition of this film, and after reading the back of the Diamond Edition, I found there were only a few differences.        First off, the aspect ratio is NOT 2.35! They have cropped this film to 1.78! The original aspect ratio, as it was seen in the theatre, was 1.85, which the Platinum sports. It might not seem like a lot, but Disney's new fling is with cutting and cropping films to make it \\"perfect\\" for those with widescreen televisions. I have no problem with seeing black bars at the bottom of my widescreen tv, because at least I know that I'm getting what I hope is the full picture.        Most of the special features as exactly the same as the Platinum. I can't tell you what the picture looks like, but I've heard the rumors that the DVD copy of the Diamond Edition is actually much better than the bluray. Once upon a time, when films were not made in high definition digital, there was something called film, which would wear after a time, and not all mistakes could be magically undone.        I will say though, the new music video for the love song is much better than Platinum's. Jordin Spark's rendition is much more beautiful, with a hint of mystery and discovery, not to mention the music video itself is quite beautiful. Jump 5's version hinted a little more at friends getting together and singing favourite Disney songs, and rather lacked at the emotional lyrics penned by Howard Ashman.        So, the Platinum Edition triumphs over the Diamond DVD copy, and the Diamond DVD copy towers over the cringe-worthy bluray.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|Extremely happy with this collector's set.  Quality of video and audio is worth the extra money.  Love the little extras it comes with...the collector cards, mini photo book...etc.  Plus the extended version includes the removed scenes and you have the option to watch either version. Well worth the money!
0312600844|1.0|This is an elaborate effort to disguise an essentially (liberal) political book as fiction (a \\"novel\\").  Unless you are a liberal who resents America and our Judeo-Christian heritage, do not reward this author with your hard-earned dollars.      The world \\"over-population\\" theme in this book is nothing but another manifestation of the disrespect liberals have for human life (created in the image of God)... abortion, population control, euthanasia through \\"health care reform\\", etc
1597801585|5.0|This book is awesome both for it's original concept/ideas, but also for the writing style that is skilled and creative.  I am so sick of writers with no skill with language (a la Dan Brown) and Paolo is a breath of fresh air.  I understand the vitriol directed at the reviewers who don't get this book and genre because I would hate to have someone not read this because a reviewer wandered out of the \\"religious/learn to read\\" section of the library and didn't like a few big words.  There is some sexual content but it brief and is NOT gratuitous and is necessary for the character development.  Paolo does build a unique and intriguing dystopian world, much in the way that William Gibson did in his early works, but I don't think Gibson is half the writer that Paolo Bacigalupi is.  I put Neal Stephenson in a class of his own, but The Windup Girl should be on the short list for Stephenson fans.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I believe this to be what blu-ray transfer should be about. I know everyone raves about the visual transfer of the second film, but I believe that the true magic lies in the transfer of the first movie! I mean it was released in 1979 and there is no way you can tell from the color and detail of the film. Of course you can tell the movie's age by the ancient Hercules computer screens, but outside of that...wow! The other movies get a little more vivid and detailed as you get to later releases and the sounds get better, but that is to be expected as technologies in filmaking continues to get better. My hat is off to the team that revived this Sci-Fi slash Horror Phenomenon!!!

0307272702|4.0|New York Times science writer Gary Taubes' book [[ASIN:1400033462 Good Calories, Bad Calories: Fats, Carbs, and the Controversial Science of Diet and Health]] has been a touchstone for everyone who has suspected that the conventional wisdom about nutrition and diet is highly flawed.  Through meticulous research and a careful reading of a massive amount of medical literature, Taubes demonstrated how hundreds of years of science showing the fattening effects of carbohydrates was set aside in the 60's in favor of unsupported advice about whole grains, lean meat and lenience on sugary and starchy foods.<br /><br />Many, including me, found Good Calories, Bad Calories a slog to get through.  Even Taubes, in public interviews, has admitted that it can be dull reading.  He says he set out to write Why We Get Fat both as a shorter and more readable version of his arguments, basing it on the lectures he has been giving to hospital staffs for the last few years.  The good news: it is more readable than Good Calories.  The bad news: it is still a bit dull.<br /><br />In order to get his arguments from Good Calories, Bad Calories slimmed down to less than 250 pages, as well as add new information about the effects of exercise, the calories-in/calories-out hypothesis and his own specific information about what we should be eating (reluctantly crammed in an appendix), he and his Knopf editor have created a book that often loses the thread of the narrative.  Often medical studies or persons are brought up without contextualizing them.  I know Taubes is deeply familiar with all the personalities who have written in this field in the last two hundred years, but if I hadn't just finished Good Calories, Bad Calories, where he does a better job of introducing them, I would have been completely lost.<br /><br />Taubes often hammers the same point repetitively.  It may be that the calories-in/calories-out hypothesis deserves an utter demolition, but too much of the start of the book is spent on this, pushing a lot of the more compelling and useful information further back where a casual reader might never bother to venture.<br /><br />That said, it is worth overlooking these flaws in the structuring of the book because there is just too much worthwhile information therein.  Taubes, like many smart people who have made use of Occam's razor, choosing the simplest explanation for why we get fat (and what to do about it), has moved towards a paleo/primal understanding of diet and exercise.  If you've already read (more readable) books like [[ASIN:0982207700 The Primal Blueprint]], [[ASIN:0471267554 The Paleo Diet]] or [[ASIN:0757001424 Deadly Harvest]], then much of what Taubes says will be familiar, if couched in a more technical and scientific way.  Ever the careful researcher, he does not go so far as promoting grass-fed meat or barring the use of peanut oil, confining himself only to advice that he can support with the evidence which he has personally scrutinized.<br /><br />Taubes has certainly written a book that doctors and other medical professionals can read and will find compelling.  I'd also highly recommend this book for the layperson who has already read a bit in the area of diet and nutrition.  If you've managed to make it all the way through Good Calories, Bad Calories, you're already well-prepared.  If the only diet books you have read have been more on the popular, mass-market side, I'd recommend reading the three books above first before jumping into the Taubes.lot of the more compelling and useful information further back where a casual reader might never bother to venture.

B0025KVLTM|4.0|The main reason I got the Sgt. Pepper's album is because of the accolade that it's number uno on Rolling Stone's magazine of \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time,\\" but I don't agree with them. It's a matter of opinion of course.<br /><br />You have your slow catchy melody \\"With A Little Help From My Friends,\\" a song I first heard by Joe Cocker, you got the classic \\"Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,\\" you got your optimistic \\"Getting Better,\\" you got the spectacular rhythm of \\"Fixing a Hole,\\" and the rest of the songs take you on a creative journey.

B000002H97|5.0|I think my review for Metallica's Black Album has been long overdue. I won't go into detail on how this fantastic album became a milestone in heavy metal history. I will, however, describe how the songs fair out. \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"The Unforgiven,\\" and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" are obviously three of the most famous songs in the band's repertoire. They're splendid songs, though I will say that \\"Enter Sandman\\" has been overplayed on the radio for a long time. \\"Sad But True\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" are grossly underrated: the percussive beats and guitar melodies are pure ecstasy. \\"Holier Than Thou,\\" \\"Don't Tread On Me,\\" and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" are also brilliant, no surprise there. \\"Through the Never\\" isn't that great in my opinion, but the last three songs (\\"The God That Failed,\\" \\"My Friend of Misery,\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\") would make a metal fan proud.<br /><br />This album isn't really perfect, so I can't really give it a perfect 10 out of 10. But since I admire this album so much, that I'll make it a 9.8. The Black Album is heavy, lyrical, and best of all, full of meaning.<br /><br />Grade: 9.8/10
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|A masterful work from an atheist who has the guts to stand up to the religious establishment and challenge the sacredness of the widespread superstition known as religion.    Dawkins' work is a fine academic piece of passionate discourse about (non) existence of God, the role of religion, its (non-supernatural) origins and how and why humanity should abandon it.     Although Dawkins is unapologetically, passionately anti religious, his book is not just some Christian bashing. It is a well spoken, elegant, well researched work.    The only complaint I have is the first one third of the book where the author discusses the possibility of God's existence and where and how religion originated. The language is sometimes too academic and the arguments very philosophical and scientific. I have university education and I'm well read, but despite this I sometimes had trouble understanding his arguments.     Dawkins is an academic living and writing in the world of high academia. He must remember that most of his readers are not. I am not saying that he should assume that people are stupid, but without very high education it is sometimes hard to follow him.     Dawkins himself notes many times the relationship between religiosity and education. The higher the education, the less religious a person tends to be. Since the purpose of this book is to convince religious people to abandon religion, by necessity it is targeting an  audience who, statistically speaking, lacks the education necessary to fully comprehend the book's arguments.

B000002LND|5.0|This a strong collection of Madonna from the 80s and 90's.  I got the chance to enjoy her music once I hit my teenage years in the 90's. This collection is so good that I can safely say that this is one of the oldest cds that I have. She has so many good songs on the cd that the best way I can summarize it is that her first 14 songs span the time period through the 80s. The last 3 songs Vogue, Justify My Love, and Rescue Me are from the early 90s (1990)(15-17). My favorite songs in the collection are \\"Open Your Heart\\", and \\"Like A Virgin\\". Both of these songs also contain good musical videos to accompany them. However, \\"Like A Virgin\\" is currently my favorite song on this collection. Definitely get this collection if you can musically appreciate any of the following: any of the Madonna songs (even if you may only like one of her songs), pop music, dance music, and/or music from the 80's and 90s.

I have five sets of earphones including:  Sennhauser HD 580, two Bose triports and Bose QC15. I also have played classical and jazz piano for over 50 years and have been listening to all kinds of music; live, with speakers and headphones most of this time. I never had one product that has excited me so much in making the quality of my collection sound markedly better. Try it for yourself.  We all have different tastes. But in my opinion you get, for less than $100.00, a major positive difference in you're headphone listening quality.  You might even find that headphones you did not like but you kept will work much better with this product.      If you look at all aspects of the E7 together in my opinion I give it a definite five star!!!!!!!!!    I am not connected in any way with the manufacturer or distributor of this product other than buying their product.    This review is my opinion only.  Larry
B001UV4XFQ|4.0|The movie is fantastic and by far my favorite in the series with a job well done with staying as faithful as possible to the book. Regarding the blu-ray plus dvd release, I would have prefered two separate discs-one blu-ray and one-standard rather than a double-sided \\"two discs in one\\" option. I may be being overly picky, but it is difficult to keep fingerprints off of the dvd when popping it back into place in the case.

1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon breaks new ground in the literary world which is difficult to do at this time in Earth history. His lively novel reads like a short story, quick but oh so filling. His character Christopher Boone will open your eyes to the fact that just because a person is different it does not mean they are unlike us. We are all human beings, great and small. Christopher Boone's humanity will remind you of that. This is another one on my MUST READ list. And this is another book I could not put down, reading it in one sitting. Delicious and oh so filling but not heavy at all, light and refreshing. A perfect pick me up to tuck into your travel bag to bring with you this holiday season. Enjoy!

Unfortunately I felt like the classifications (nodes) were way off.  The introduction made perfect sense to be but as I started to read my node I felt like I was reading about a different person.  I'm letting some friends borrow the book to get their opinion.  Maybe I'll re-read again later, but for now I wouldn't recommend this book.

B003EYVY04|5.0|The Ultimate Edition movies are simply excellent. They give you more of what goes on behind the scenes and the making of the movie. I can see why it takes so long for the Ultimate Edition movies to come out. There is so much in the other discs, that we of course didn't get to see. I can't wait for the other UE to come out, especially for the movies I hold dear to me.
0439023513|5.0|Very satisfying, disturbing, but real third book in the series.  This book has a darker, older feel than the other two.  I would recommend for mature 8th graders and above.
0470913029|5.0|The Paleo Diet is one of the best diet plans out there- and by diet plan, I don't mean a fad that will help you lose weight in an unsustainable way. PD focuses on sustainable eating of the healthiest foods and healthy exercise (evidently the CrossFit movement has adopted PD as their diet of choice). You cannot argue with the menu: lean meats and fish, fresh fruits, snacks, and non-starchy vegetables; or their benefits: weight loss and the prevention of heart disease, cancer, osteoporosis. The point is get rid of the crap on today's modern fast-food Styrofoam plate and you're going to be healthy.<br /><br />One glaring miss here (as in with the original PD) is the separation of macronutrients (as described in [[ASIN:1600200478 The Evolution Diet]]). This is, simply, to reflect the natural diet of man by eating fruits and veggies throughout the day and a large lean-meat selection after exercise. The benefits of this separation is well documented in Evolution Diet, but gets no PT here, unfortunately.<br /><br />Still, aside from its misses, PD is highly recommended. You will be a healthier person if you follow this plan, I guarantee it.

B002ZG981E|3.0|\\"A director makes only one movie in his life. Then he breaks it into pieces and makes it again.\\"   - Jean Renoir    (SPOILERS)    There's a great deal of applicability of this quote when it comes to Christopher Nolan. In Memento a man accidentally kills his wife and can't deal with the guilt so he creates a world of his own to live in in order to come to terms with what happened; in Inception basically the same thing happens but instead of telling the story backwards & from the perspective of someone who no longer has any short term memory this time the gimmick is dreams.    Being the spontaneous internet forum wanderer that I am I'd heard here & there comparisons to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of just how intensely visceral of an impact the film has on one's psyche. Now, I didn't go into my viewing with this in mind, but it lingered there back in my subconscious where the guy from Third Rock from the Sun & Bronson were trying to steal whatever secrets I have.    The difference between a film like Kubrick's awe inspiring masterpiece and Nolan's film which only makes it to the level of 'just good' is that there's this sense in Nolan's film of being scared of alienating too many people from enjoying his film. \\"Well, I'll make it sort of complex, but only include the most base ideas and the most placid dreams imaginable. Oh, and the end will be kind of ambiguous but not too much, don't want to make anyone angry or instigate any kind of lengthy discussions.\\"    As seems to be the deal with Nolan his main actor is really cringe worthy or laugh inducing (\\"OH JESUS CHRIST!!!!\\") DiCaprio doesn't go through the film growling at people but he is still pretty bad. To be honest the only one who doesn't seem to be phoning in a performance is Tom Hardy, and that's only barely the case.    The folding of Paris was pretty nice, but everything else just seemed flat and Nolan never, in 150 minutes, gets the feel of a dream quite down; not when DiCaprio is Mr. Charles inthe bar, not when Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Jamiroquai-ing it up with some guys in a hall or hauling a floating bundle of his buddies into an elevator. There's nothing in this film that you can't learn about dreams from Richard Linklater's phenomenal film \\"Waking Life\\", so, Inception proves to be a fairly useless film in the end, but it is, oddly enough, worth at least one viewing.
0399536108|1.0|Here's yet another book written to cash in on the \\"I hate my life and would change if only I knew what to do\\" craze. This book has been written at least 20 times already. Save your money; nothing new here. I started skimming about half-way through. Has anyone noticed that from psychologists to gurus to career advisers, the real money seems to be in telling people how to break out of \\"the mold\\" rather than in actually breaking out of the mold? Or is it just me?
0399536108|4.0|So many people say they want to be great, but they never actually do anything to make that a reality.    Chris breaks down the myths and assumptions people hold onto that keep them from living their full life, using their unique voice, and taking personal responsibility.     I found myself nodding, sometimes snorkling with laughter, and often smiling as I read this book. The stories and examples are nicely real and grounded so each of us can see how we can make choices that align our dreams and aspirations with our daily life.
B004EI3ON4|3.0|While listening to this soundtrack I found myself playing a game of \\"Match the track to the movie scene.\\"  \\"Something is probably being absconded during this track.\\"  \\"I would peg this one for an epic battle piece.\\"  \\"This one would make a pretty good character death track.\\"  \\"Alright, this one has to be the ending credits.\\" *checks track* \\"Yep, ending credits.\\"  Naturally, given the time of this review, I haven't seen the film yet.  The point I'm trying to make though is that this soundtrack is pretty standard stuff and really doesn't tread over any new ground that hasn't been covered before.  That's not to say that it isn't well-composed.  The album mostly consists of sweeping orchestra pieces, lightly sprinkled with electronica.  However, with exception of Derezzed, most of the tracks often felt repetitive.  It's a decent listen and worth the price that I paid for it (which was $3.99 at the time).  It probably will also do an excellent job complementing the movie.  However it doesn't stand too well on its own. If you're looking for that edgy, new, innovative electronica album that you can throw on repeat, you won't find it here.  Rob Dougan would probably be a better bet if you're looking for an artist that blends electronica and orchestral music well.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I purchased this memory module in order to upgrade the current memory which I have installed on the Asus 1215N netbook. Unfortunately, Asus hasn't updated their firmware to support many memory manufacturers and one of the few modules which can be used in the Asus 1215N is the Kingston 2GB SODIMM 204 pin DDR3 model #KVR1333D3S8S9/2G.    Note that there are other memory modules by Kingston which have a very similar name but that currently DO NOT work with the Asus 1215N.    So far I'm very pleased with this purchase.

B002MW50KO|5.0|THis is the second year that I have been blessed to have Bob's CHRISTMAS IN THE HEART.  I cannot recommend it enough, if you love to watch old Xmas movies and listen to great, traditional Xmas songs.  This collection, when first released last year, made me stop and think \\"no...NOT Dylan too!\\".  The more I thought about it, I thought it was too kitsch, and being a huge Dylan Fan, I thought at the time 'what the heck'.  Also sent some to friends for the holidays.<br /><br />Well, this is my all-time fav Xmas music to listen to!!  Dylan's honest, heartfelt renditions (of course!) are excellent, and when you add the kitschy soundtracks and background vocals, it can't be beat.  It warms my heart as a nice hot toddy warms my body.  I cannot recommend this enough!  My friends called and emailed when they got this delivered for Xmas, and they all said the same thing: Bob Dylan for Christmas - OF COURSE!  The fact that all the royalties are donated to his favorite feed the hungry NP makes it all that much sweeter.  If you 'do' the Xmas music thing every year, then you MUST have this for your Spirits, Friends and Family for Christmas.  Even E. Scrooge would have run right out and slapped down his shillings for this one, mate!
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Works as advertised.  I like the long mic cord it comes with.  I did purchase a two into one plug ($2.99 @ Radio Shack)to get the sound onto both soundtracks, otherwise you'll only get sound out of one playback speaker.  This is a mono (one track) mic.
1439177783|5.0|Portia has been able to put all her demons on to paper, writing is a wonderful way of releasing inner demons, I do hope for Portia's sake she has done this. With Ellen by her side she can only go forward, as Ellen is her rock. The book is beautifully written and very tastefully described, the haunting, the torture she went through. It came through warts and all. It should be read by everyone that wants the knowledge of life this really gives it all. Congratulations Portia I wish you happiness and health for the rest of your life, from one gay Geelong girl to another.

The twist was even predictable.I enjoyed reading Safe Have just not my favorite expecially by Sparks
B0041EVYVK|2.0|This could have been a great cd.  Lanois has made wonderful things for other people, but this set of tunes seem to have missing parts.

B002RI9PKO|4.0|The good Gladwell has generally some problems keeping a stringent argumentation in his books, one chapter can actually contradict another, and other parts of the book might seem off topic. I have had this feeling in all his books which I have read. But the different stories/anecdotes/analyses are interesting and sometimes funny stand alone. So as a collection of cultural, external and random influence on social behavior (and sometimes success) it is a nice read -- but remember it is not science.

0307594777|4.0|I have actually received the books sooner than i was expecting it which I'm very very happy about.  Because of that I could start reading it earlier.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Let me just start out saying I loved the first 2 books. I've read them over and over again, and eagerly awaited this book. I made my mom drive me ro Barnes & Noble to by it as soon as it came out. The books only got better as they went along, so I assumed this book would be amazing.    Boy, was I wrong!   I don't like the deaths of my favorite characters, but I understand SOME are nesseciary. Like with Rue. I cried when she died, but I understand why she did. It seemed like Collins introduced us to all these great characters and events but then had to go and say, &#34;Ha ha, remember who controls this story? You're going to die now!&#34;    I was getting VERY annoyed with all the deaths. It seemed like she made a point to surprise us at every turn - and not in a good way. So don't get me started about Prim's death. I was so confused, allthe sudden Katniss was crying in a room somewhere. I had to go back and reread what happened, and when I realized who had died, I sat there bawling. I mean, the whole story started with Prim's name being called at the reaping. And then she died in a senseless death, basically as a result of the rebellion started by her sister, trying to save her life? I really don't get it.    And then the ending. I'm more team Gale then Peeta, but I just wanted a good ending. Did I get one? No. Prim is dead. Gale and Katniss don't ever talk. Katniss, mother doesn't talk to her either. Haymitch is silent too. And of course we're left with a depressed feeling about Peeta and Katniss along with their children. I could go on on, but it's hard to type on a Kindle.     So overall, the book did not meet my expetcaions in anyway. I promied myself I would never read it again, but I will because we will be reading The Hunger Games in class, so minds well finish them off. The one thing I want to know is, why does everyone like it so much?
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A picture for the whole family, beautiful scenery, extraordinary horse and a woman who believed in that horse.  A worthwhile watch with actors who were meant to play the roles.
B0041KKYDI|4.0|Before I watched \\"127 Hours\\" I think I wasn't alone in wondering how even a great director like Danny Boyle could make a full length film about a guy with his arm pinned against a wall. I'm pleased to say that Boyle pulled it off, and not only did he pull it off, he made an excellent film in the process. \\"127 Hours\\" tells the harrowing story of Aron Ralston(played by James Franco), an adventure seeking outdoors man who has the misfortune of falling down a crevasse and getting his arm pinned against the wall by a huge rock. All that Ralston has is a dull knife, climbing equipment, a camcorder and a limited water supply. Where Boyle and Franco shine is the time spent after the fateful accident. Boyle implements many familiar tricks from his directing arsenal but they only add color and depth to what otherwise could of been a simple and straight forward tale of survival.     Boyle uses stunning images of Utah's Canyonlands National park and numerous zoom outs to show just how secluded Ralston really was. Franco on the other hand, pulls off a masterful performance of a man face to face with his mortality. Franco plays Ralston as a man who knows that the last moments of his life are slowly ticking away and he goes through the gauntlet of emotions. After being shocked and enraged with his situation, Ralston enters into zen like clarity and acceptance. \\"Whoever finds this camcorder can keep it\\" Ralston calmly states \\"Just let my parents know what happened to me\\". As the hours pass, and his valiant attempts to free himself fail(At one point Ralston creates a pulley system with his climbing equipment. it fails but it was still pretty ingenuous)    Ralston reflects on his life's triumphs and shortcomings, most of which revolve around his family and failed relationships, things that most of us would be thinking about in the same situation. As desperation mounts, Ralston finally goes for broke and decides to become his own surgeon. The scene is hard to watch but I found it impossible to turn away. 127 Hours is a fantastic film about how Ralston showed amazing perseverance and processed the metal fortitude not to give into despair. I only hope that if I'm faced with the same situation I process the same qualities. I guess you don't know until it happens to you.
0525951652|3.0|I adored Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and the World Without End, so I was really excited about reading the Fall of Giants especially because it takes place during one of my favorite time periods before WWI. This book is about a cast of characters from different backgrounds American, British, Welsh, German, and Russian and their interactions with each other before, during and after the events of WWI. I really enjoyed the historical information and even though I am not usually a fan of battle scenes I thought all of this added to the book. All of the major aspects of the war, political ramifications and major world events of the time period can be found in detail. There really is something for everyone. The only problem I had with the novel was the blending of the character's lives and the relationship with each other and history. It seemed like there was too many characters to keep up with and too many story lines to blend into history. Some sections read a bit to choppy. It might have been more beneficial to have made this particular book into a trilogy in itself instead of making the next two books about later periods of the century. Despite this, I found myself turing pages rapidly and constantly thinking about the book and wondering what was going to happen to the charcaters.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Hello,    I have seen a lot of martial arts movies and none have recently impressed me so much. The martial arts look realistic with what looks like minimal wire work and the story although sometimes a little thin on the acting skills was interesting and well scripted. Donnie Yen is a great hero who will have you cheering during many of his excellently choreographed scenes. The film has a nice balance of comedy and drama and it is great to see a martial arts film in the unique setting of China during the Japanese occupation. Highly recommended.

1400032717|4.0|I really enjoyed The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time.  I've never known anyone with autism or studied it so it was fascinating to be suddenly dropped into an autistic first-person narration. I think the intention was to show how differently and similarly someone with autism thinks, the reasons behind actions other people don't understand, the extra strain on family dynamics and how difficult it is to live in a world where people predominately don't think like you do. Everything was so methodical, rational and logical and yet most people responded by thinking Christopher was stupid, crazy or bizarre. I've never read a novel with this POV before and I think it was well done how Haddon balanced everything. On one hand, everything Christopher does seems perfectly logical because we're sucked into the narrative but peoples' reactions and Siobhan's (his teacher) coaching to keep a compare/contrast going throughout to show how different Christopher thinks from the other characters' in the novel.     Again, I don't know much about autism. I just know that this was well-written and very different from any fiction I've read before.
B002ZG981E|2.0|Saw this film in the theater. The acting is credible--even fantastic in parts. It is a showcase of extraordinarily creative special effects, mostly. It does have an amazing \\"wow\\" factor, but that fails to hide the fact that the story itself relies far too heavily on the viewer being distracted by all of that to the point that the thin story line isn't obvious.     As for plot, it's not what you think it is.  It is not brilliant, nor groundbreaking, nor unprecedented. Using dreams as the backdrop, the writers felt as though they could pass off anything they wished and it would hold together.  It does not. It is circuitous--annoyingly so. The \\"layers\\" of dreams created are no different than looking at a reflection in a fun house mirror that goes on and on and on. The storyline trips all over itself, but the viewer is expected to marvel at its complex layers. Viewers become engaged in startling special effects, and think they are so cool, they forgive the movie's inconsistencies and pointless scenes. You obviously can kick back and get lost in the sheer fantasy of this film, but instead of experiencing breathtakingly intelligent drama, it is a mish-mash.      Picture the concept session for this movie: a bunch of doubtlessly talented minds come together to make a brilliant movie...but...EGO gets in the way, and each creative mind wants to include his or her pet idea(s), unyielding in any way,  not cooperating in any way, until....a movie is pushed out that has everything in it but the kitchen sink, is ridiculously long, and drags unmercifully at many parts. About 3/4 of the way through, I was yawning at the utterly pointless use of even more explosives(for the umpteenth time) and even more death (for the umpteenth time).    The dream scenario as a plot basis does not excuse directionless storytelling, which by the way, is constantly \\"told\\" by the characters.  A good film would not need this crutch--the story would tell itself.    This film's best aspect is the art direction and special effects, with the music a close second. The story, weak as it is, hides behind the film's production excellence.    Expect this film to win awards for its creative technical production and execution.  With \\"blockbuster\\" status, it may also win, but does not deserve, accolades for its screenplay.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|The sound out of this headset is great, especially it's surround features. It's very easy to decipher whether something is behind you, to whichever side, etc. through the comfortable and breathable ear speakers.<br /><br />1 huge flaw to the device is the mute feature, which is highly valuable for online play. XBOX's standard headset that comes with the console has the mute button right at the tip of your thumb on the controller where it plugs in, incredibly easy use and highly more convenient. The Ear Force X41's mute button is located halfway up the wire connecting to the controller and is a sliding button, serving as a huge inconvenience for fast, quick muting options (you have to find the button, which is also a volume control, up the wire, feel around for the button slider and then slide to mute, sometimes having to look down at it and maybe even use 2 hands!). If you're single and/or living alone/playing only in solitude, it's no big deal as there are no secondary conversations to be had.<br /><br />The base station for the Ear Force X41 also cannot be turned off wirelessly. You have to get up and find the power button on the back of the device to turn it off. While you can turn the actual headset off by the button on the left ear speaker, the base stays on until you get up to turn it off. Nobody wants to get up just to turn the headphones base station off, they don't even want to get up to turn the console off, hence the wireless shutdown feature on the 360.<br /><br />The range of the headset is also a disadvantage. Getting up to grab something out of the next room 15 feet away with the headset on resulted in crazy loud static as the headset was out of range from it's base as wells as disconnection from communication capabilities, which were incredibly hard to reconnect without shutting off the communication device and turning it back on again.<br /><br />These are good things to know and consider for this product.
0465092764|5.0|In what is sure to be a resurgence of interest in less fashionable theories of physics, Mr. Woit is the first to state a lucid case against string theory.    The correct word for \\"string theory\\" as it now stands may indeed be \\"pataphysics\\", rather than physics. (Take the nomenclature as a critical cool rather than yet another pointlessly esoteric reality.) Pataphysics (a fun concept delineated by 19th-century playwright Alfred Jarry) has been described as \\"that which extends as far beyond metaphysics as metaphysics extends beyond physics\\" ... which is a fancy way of saying \\"speculation based on speculation.\\"    And this, in essence, is where string theory now stands. As a speculation whose roots are grounded *in other* speculative areas, string theory might be best described as \\"mathematics run amok,\\" now creating a context unto itself.    (A pataphor, after all, is but a metaphor that has set sail from its root and created its own context, on choppy seas where small fish live.)    When math no longer describes the real world, but exists to create (and support) its own reality, the physical world may be deemed ultimately unnecessary as a reference point.    But that, unfortunately,  is not the role of physical sciences.    That being the case, Mr. Woit's book presents a refreshing wake-up call, regardless of whether string theory ends up adding value to science's explication of the physical world.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Definitivamente, valio la pena la compra de este par de piezas clave para un mejor uso del control del PS3 cuando no lo tienes pues como que notas que algo le falta a los triggers y ahi la vas librando pero cuando los compras y los utilizas, te das cuenta de que es un valor agregado para tu control, sobre todo en first person shooters como Call of Duty o en juegos de carreras tipo Need For Speed o de batallas cuerpo a cuerpo como Dragon Ball Burst Limit. El soporte que ofrecen permite una mejoria al momento de \\"disparar\\" y son muy comodos, ni siquiera notas que hay algo extra en el control, son livianos de un color casi igual pues estan hechos con un material similar en un 90-95 % de manera que jamas te haran estorbo. Deben tener cuidado de no botar el control pues si este cae del lado de los trigger, generalmente asi cae, se pueden quebrar los sooprtes pues son sensibles, y por ser plastico es facil de que se rompa, pero solo si es una caida fuerte, cuando a mi me paso 1 vez, salieron volando... ES UNA EXCELENTE COMPRA, VALE LA PENA!    This purchase definitively worth it! when you don't have this things well it seems that something is missing from the controll but it's ok... but when you buy this littles things ant try it! you can realize that add an extra value to the controll. this things are perfect in FPS games like Call of Duty and in Race Games like Need for Speed or the fight ones like Dragon Ball Burst Limit ! i recommend widely are so comfortable, light and are made of almost the same material that the original triggers maybe a 90-95% of similarity.  You should be careful to not let the controll falls because this things can be broke because are made of plastic and are kinda sensible, first times maybe will fly by the air!   IT IS AN EXCELENT PURCHASE i recommend!
B000002U94|5.0|BOB SEGER AND THE SILVER BULLET BAND-NINE TONIGHT: Although his earlier breakthrough concert disc LIVE BULLET is a stone classic in rock music circles, NINE TONIGHT is the 1980 sequel that rounds up all the heartland soul man's undisputed biggies in one helluva party platter; nothing he did after this packed half as much punch, power or passion. Seger is in superb raspy voice throughout the festivities, his Silver Bullets back him with slick righteous power, and the fun threshhold is cranked to \\"ten\\". Signature anthem OLD TIME ROCK & ROLL is given a lengthy, crank-yankin' intro you'll never hear elsewhere, RNB nugget TRYIN' TO LIVE MY LIFE WITHOUT YOU cooks with feverish gospel backing vocals, and teen angst showpiece NIGHT MOVES sounds as crisp and poignant as it ever did. The only misstep is the finale, a cover of Chuck Berry's LET IT ROCK already done to better effect on LIVE BULLET.

1423101472|2.0|*** Warning: This review contains spoilers! ***<br /><br />I was disappointed in this final book of the series. I gave previous books in the series from 2 1/2 to 4 stars, but this one I really thought was the worst. I know it was written for a younger audience, and maybe my expectations were too high, but I just felt it was lacking in so many ways.<br /><br />As usual, there was too much re-cap in re-introducing characters. I guess there's value in making each book a stand-alone book, but I still think it could have been done more naturally, less explicitly.<br /><br />As the series progressed, both Annabeth and Percy became torn between two love interests, and I think Riordan did a good job portraying their feelings. However, Annabeth's hypocritical behavior was nothing short of bitchy. I am loath to use profanity, but that is honestly the best word to describe her. By the end, I was rooting for Rachel (who, by the way, became one of my favorite characters). Even after all the back-and-forth with Annabeth's emotions, the closing scenes didn't give her enough credit - with a repentant Luke dying in her arms, she tells him she didn't love him, even though she pined for him through all five books?! Whatever.<br /><br />Rachel's new-found clairvoyance was a nice development, but did Riordan have to do it &agrave; la Isaac Mendez from Heroes?<br /><br />All the characters remained too one-dimensional, and Riordan unfortunately passed up opportunities for some real character development. Clarisse is given a soft side via Chris and Silena, but she remained unapologetically hot-tempered, stubborn, and proud. Silena, for her part, made a valiant eleventh-hour push to help the heroes, but her role as spy was completely brushed aside, chalked up to her naivet&eacute; and Luke's manipulation. Apparently, since she was otherwise well-liked, there was no need to be concerned about the deaths her espionage caused, including that of her boyfriend Beckendorf.<br /><br />There was a definite annoyingly Harry Potter-esque moment when Percy wanted to contact Rachel but didn't know how to do it. Apparently, the most common means of mythological communication - the Iris-message - slipped his mind.<br /><br />Throughout most of the story, the heroes are fully engaged in a war with the Titans, and much of the book describes one battle scene after another. Unfortunately, rather than making the reader feel as if he is caught up in the action as well, the battle descriptions read more like matter-of-fact reporting. And, as usual, there's a lot of being saved at the last minute by an unexpected third party.<br /><br />At the close of the series, I was unimpressed with the entire story arc. The Titan lord Kronos was re-formed only because of Luke's actions, and in the end, it was Luke himself who saved the world from Kronos. It just seems kind of lame that the potential ruin of the known world, and it's savior, came down to one person changing his mind.<br /><br />Finally, there was quite a bit of discussion about fate in the book, and how nobody, including Hermes, could have stopped Luke's fate. Love of friends, good education, not even better parenting could have helped Luke to make better decisions. This type of defeatism really bothered me, especially since the intended audience is middle schoolers; I don't like the idea of giving impressionable youth the message that no matter what they do, no matter what their parents do, no matter what path they take in life, they have one undeniable and immutable fate.rcy wanted to contact Rachel but didn't know how to do it.

B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Great sticker package.  Redid our daughter's room and she absolutely loves it.  First time she walked in she just looked around with her mouth hanging open.  Used the jewels as \\"bling\\" for her horse step stool that she uses to get into bed.  Very nice extra.
B00275EHJG|5.0|My family and I are huge fans of anything Pixar, but the Toy Story series are the best. Toy Story 3 is by far the most emotional and heart wrenching of the three. When you know this is the last one in the series, when you've seen the relationships develop through the years, you cannot help but tear up and cry during the movie. Ok, so my daughter is going off to college this year and everything in this movie hit close to home as well. If you have a heart and soul, you cannot help but be affected by this movie. Kudos to Pixar for producing such quality entertainment that touches us so deeply that you forget it's an animated flick. We're going to miss you, Toy Story crew!
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Some people say that BTR is just a show to mimic Jonas from Disney channel.... Wrong!! I've watched both shows and they are nothing alike. Jonas brothers are already famous, yet BTR are a brand new band struggling with becoming famous. They literally started from the ground up. I love the show and theyre CD album has a song for everyone. It has pop and hip hop with a dash of rap in a few songs. I dont think they rap but there are featured artists who do. I would really recommend this to preteens. They would love it! And watch the show please on Nickelodeon. It's funnier than Jonas. Just my opinion. I love the Jonas Brothers too, though, dont get me wrong.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Awesome movie!  I've like both the other Toy Story movies, and I like most other Disney movies in general, but this was definitely one of the best cartoons ever.  Its just a really funny, exciting, and touching movie.  A must buy.
B0028IDXDS|2.0|My son is 4 months old and will only take a pacifier if attached to a stuffed animal. It nakes it easier for him if he drops it, he can get it back into his mouth mostly on his own. I thought we would try this brand as a back up for his other one. When it arrived, I felt the quality was poor and there is no way to change the pacifier. The other one we have can easily detach so the stuffed animal can be washed in the machine. I can carry extra pacis in case one gets dropped or spit up on and I am not in a place to wash or at least rinse it off. I would not suggest this brand.
B0041T52S6|4.0|It seems that Hollywood, as always, never quite gets the things they take an option on to make films from. A best selling novel ends up omitting the things people loved about it for the flashier scenes. A TV series has the heart of it tossed aside for the shiny surface of the recognizable characters. And comic books are more often than not done as if the film makers had a fear of making a movie that, well, looks like a comic book. Until recently comic book based films tossed aside all that made them what fans loved and instead turned them into stereotypical films that used the characters names and little more.<br /><br />SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD is not one of those films. Director Edgar Wright, who made SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, understands what fans of this comic book loved. The quirkiness of the characters, the unimaginable situations and the slam bang fight sequences that comics fans adore. Yes Wright understands these things, gets the fact that comic fans look for them and doses them out slowly but surely here.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is an early twenties something guitar player in a band that has yet to find success. Having recently found a new girlfriend in high school student Knives Chau (Ellen Wong), things are looking up. The band has an important gig coming up that may land them an actual contract and a chance at being paid. And then Scott sees Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).<br /><br />Quickly dumping Knives, Scott sets his sights on Ramona, attempting to gain her favor. The pair eventually take a liking to one another. But then something odd happens. One of Ramona's ex lovers' shows up and challenges Scott to a duel to the death. For some odd reason, all of Ramona's seven ex lovers must battle anyone who wants to be her new boyfriend, an unfortunate circumstance for Scott.<br /><br />Until this point the movie seems a bit slow, but that's all to set up what follows. We get to know the characters, where they stand in one another's lives and how they fit into the story. Once the ex lovers appear to duke it out with Scott, the film veers quickly into the whole comic book world of ultra violence that never gets much more serious than a Road Runner cartoon. Kicks land people across rooms, into skyscrapers and disappearing. And no one ever questions if this is right or not let alone police showing up to ask what happened. It's accepted as part of the story.<br /><br />As the ex lover count winds down we finally find out the real reason for the battles, just how they began and why Scott must defeat each one if he is to claim the hand of Ramona. It's an interesting journey and one that offers some dynamic visuals and fight sequences. Keep in mind though this isn't a serious film by any means but more of a fun filled adventure with plenty of humor.<br /><br />So is it a good movie? Yes, it is, though as I said you have to give it a bit of time for it all to come together. As it began I found myself thinking oh no, another Michael Cera movie where he's all teen angst and he's a goofy dorky nerd who can't put a sentence together without seeming pathetic. But it isn't that at all. And while I'm not the biggest fan of Cera, he actually does a good job here as does the entire cast.<br /><br />But it's the comic book come to life portion of this movie that makes it worthwhile. Not just in the fact that this world involves seven ex lovers who come back not to reunite with their past girlfriend but to stop her from having someone new in her life, no that's not enough. We even get the chance to have the long loved graphically displayed sound effects projected on screen for us. If \\"POW!\\" is the word on the page then \\"POW!\\" actually shows on the screen.<br /><br />I've only read on SCOTT PILGRIM comic and wasn't thrilled with it. I am a fan of Edgar Wright though. And with this film he solidifies his role as one of the better directors that have come along in some time. While this film didn't find theaudience that the studio thought it would, it might be one of those films that finds an audience on DVD. If you're looking for something a little different, a little fun and definitely tied to the world of comics, you won't do much better right now than SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD.those films that finds an audience on DVD.

B00402FGE4|5.0|This is a darker, edgier Stargate than the previous shows. I have always been a fan of the Stargate shows but they have been lighter and more family fun shows, while these are complex and have more unexpected twists in the story. I really like most of the characters, even when they don't act with the perfect nobility so common on tv, when faced with extraordinary situations. Robert Carlyle does a great job as the most necessary character that everyone on board loves to hate. The rest of the cast are excellent as well. This show is like Stargate meets Hitchcock or Harlan Ellison. Great fun! I highly recommend it !
B0043A0PXU|5.0|I don't want to bash anyone's negative review of the is CD but I'll simply state that those who had negative things to say about this CD are all wrong.  What CD were you listening to?    I'm a fan of really well done Christmas songs and Christmas albums or which there are very few of the latter.  I saw this in the store and I thought I'd give it a listen.  It was simply amazing!  For the last number of years we've been treated to so much treacle from top 40 artists who release a Christmas CD at the height of their careers to earn big from the Cash Cow of holiday music shoppers.  Give me a break!  With the exception of Leigh Nash and Sixpence None The Richer and their wonderful Christmas CDs, there has been nothing else outstanding in Christmas music...until now!    I'm not a huge fan of Lennox.  In fact, I don't own any of her other music but I did enjoy \\"Pavement Cracks\\" & \\"The Saddest Song I've Got\\" from a few years ago.  Lennox does have the chops though, I'll give her that.  In this CD her voice is loud and raw and gentle and everything you want in a Christmas CD.  A word of caution, you'll want to play this CD loud because that's how she sings it.  There's full emotion in every song and you feel it because Annie Lennox puts everything she has into every song.  The orchestration is beautiful and at times you wonder if the music is accompanying Lennox or is she accompanying the music.  And that's it really, her voice is an instrument, as another has said, and it melds with the music.      Very rarely do you listen to something like this for the first time and are extremely moved.  When it comes to Christmas music that has only happened a few times for me in the past few years.  The first was a couple of years ago when I heard Frank Sinatra's version of Silent Night from 1991 while I was driving in my car.  I hadn't heard it before and it was his last recorded song and it's full of that same rawness that's in this CD but Sinatra's is quieter and meant to be heardthat way.  The other time was with the aforementioned Sixpence None The Richer's \\"Dawn of Grade\\" Christmas CD.  Leader singer Leigh Nash has such a beautiful voice and on \\"Dawn of Grace\\" and her own Christmas EP \\"Wishing For This\\", you find yourself entranced and honestly, I listen to her Christmas music throughout the year...it's that good.    But Christmas Cornucopia is about Annie Lennox and the selections are distinct and what Christmas is all about.  You'll sing loud when you sing along and you'll listen hard when you just sit there and are amazed by her voice.  For those who said they chucked this one in the garbage, I say dig it out and unplug from the top 40 and give this another listen.  It doesn't get any better than this.  Thank you Annie!
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I won't go into the great writing and acting on this show, as they've been covered exhaustively.  Let me make this clear:  I love this show.  Can't wait for season 2. Etc. etc.      However, I was severely disappointed in the picture quality of the DVD.  The first scene looks like it was filmed on a flip camera, and sadly doesn't improve much from there.  They might have been going for \\"gritty realism\\" but this is almost to the point of pixelated.  \\"Jaggies\\" with camera movement, highly distracting, I've seen better home movies.  This looks like a third-gen VHS.  I would have been better off just burning a DVD from my DVR drive.  Reading other reviews I found Blu-ray customers with similar complaints, so I'm glad I didn't shell out extra at least.      That being said, the extras are meaty and worth every penny.  Sad to say though I'm not terribly tempted by the promise of a \\"limited edition\\" in October unless they clean up the picture a little.  This show deserves better.
B004259BMM|5.0|I have every one of his albums, and this definitely is the best yet! I wanna hear it over and over again ALL DAY! I highly recommend it.
B004132I20|5.0|As a fan of the original books and of Jermery Brett's incredible portrayal of Holmes, I was worried about this adaptation of the world's first consulting detective. However, my worries were unfounded. As I watched the first film starting, I noticed that it was created by Steven Moffet who brought us the brilliant BBC series \\"Coupling\\" and I knew I was in for a treat. While Holmes is not a romantic comedy, Moffet has proven to be a creative powerhouse.<br /><br />He has taken Sherlock into the 21st century with a flair that I  believe Doyle would approve of without question. If one thinks for a moment about just how you would take the stories, dust of 100 years and keep faith with the original. Quite a task, indeed.<br /><br />The casting is brilliant, the production values are simply amazing and with this disk you get the pilot as well that was filmed as a 60 minute piece and when the BBC ordered 3 90 minute shows, instead of just shooting some filler for the 60 minute pilot, they went back and revamped the script and shot a 90 minute episode. Hollywood could relearn how to produce by taking methods from these folks.<br /><br />If you are a die hard Sherlock Holmes purist as I am, order this now, you are in for a real treat!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|THank you for an efficient purchase!  We ordered and received our DVD with in days.  Very fast, very trouble free.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I preordered this set and have not been disappointed. I don't intend to gripe about the price, it is posted before you choose to spend your money, so why are you whining? As for the movies, I personally like all four and do NOT accept the reviews that state as fact that there are only two \\"good\\" movies in the Aliens collection. I respect other's opinions but like the incessant whining about the price, you knew it was a 4 movie set before you bought it, get over it. Now for my rant: they load slow due to all the \\"crap\\" razzle dazzle that it seems have been forced upon us by either the studios to make more $$ or from idiots that need, want or crave  for some completely insane BS instead of the MOVIES! OK, end of rant.    I believe the production values are super. Define that as sound, transfer or  whatever technical aspect you wish, again in MY opinion all of the movies are great in this respect. I have owned all of these films in all of their prior release formats and this set tops them all. I took my other DVDs and donated them to various Veterans hospitals and homes who were thrilled to have them for our Veterans entertainment. I urge everyone to do this with all of their old media (and anything else) as there is a need by those  who care for our Vets for everything, even entertainment items.     I'm glad I made this purchase and Amazon has been great. On my 56\\" TV, 7.1 surround sound blu-ray setup, these films kick ass!
0316098337|2.0|Although I found this book to be highly readable and I zoomed through it, I cannot agree with all the raves.  It is a compelling story, but it has some BIG problems.  Jack's voice is annoying and he is inconsistent-sometimes sounding wise beyond his years and at others, he makes no sense.  The escape story is not plausible.  It is a desperate attempt by Ma that put her son at great risk.  The fact that she still breast feeds him at 5 years old is disturbing.  Ma's suicide attempt is probably the worst plot development of the entire book! If she's in a psychiatric facility, how did she ever get pills for an over-dose?  Also, it feels as if there wasn't much effort put into finding her.  It seems like her family wrote her off. Not recommended.
B003Q6D27S|1.0|The dvd is going to be the r rated cut.Only the blu ray will be the unrated version.It is good if you have a bluray player but at this time I still only have a dvd player.In my opinion it is a ploy to try to make people buy bluray.They are doing the same thing with the town bluray dvd releases.It sucks for us who cant afford to switch to bluray.
0545302862|5.0|I'm buying this set for my daughter to read for the second time!  We borrowed the books from a friend to read for the first time, but my daughter loved them so much, she put the set at the top of her Christmas list.  I pre-read the books before my daughter, and ended up loving them as much as she does.
0596805888|5.0|so far it is fantastic!  I have not read the whole book but the science is fun and interesting and has already made changes in how I prepare a few meals.
B004FDY4LE|4.0|I am disappointed in many of the departures this series has made from the graphic novel, as well as the oversimplified characterizations of many key characters. This series would have been much better if they had stuck to the original script and if they had made their characters less \\"Hollywood\\" and more real life (Dale).    I won't mention any spoilers. But if they had been faithful to the script and strayed less into bizarre areas, such as the politically correct inner city gangsters, this show would be truly epic.    But I have to admit this series is well done. I can understand that TV is not the same format as a graphic novel and departures had to be made. I think the only real complaint is that the first season was criminally short. It was hard to develop many of the characters, and feels about a third of the way through what a full season should be.
B000001FDQ|5.0|I can't explain the influence that this album had on me as guitarist. By now most everyone is familiar with it and it seems a shame that this album seems to be almost forgotten. This is mostly instrumental music and it's of a very high caliber. Songs like \\"Black Star\\", \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\", \\"Little Savage\\", \\"Icarus: Dream Suite\\", \\"Evil Eye\\" are just great songs brilliantly played. These were songs that inspired me to practice and I remember them for that. It says something that Yngwie still covers many of these in concert to this very day. Find a concert video without \\"Black Star\\" or \\"Far Beyond The Sun\\".
B002BU0DPE|1.0|Product started failing about 5 months after purchase. I'm thinking the very thin wires going into the earpieces get worn out because they swivel to fit your ears. I'm no longer a TB customer.
0743454537|4.0|This is the first book i've read from this author...i did enjoy the story and the topic at which the story is about. Now i'm going to watch the movie...However I rated the book 3.5 stars because i thought the author bounced around to much and had to much going on with the story that i was a little confused at times about when events happened who she she was talking about.      I will be reading  \\"The Pact\\" next.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Again, a wonderful example of Josh's ability...I just don't care for the songs yet; it will take a while to listen over and over and decide which I like...
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I got these to replace/complement my Grado 225's so I had high standards for headphone sound quality. The great thing about the Grado's is the sound quality, the bad thing is the comfort. I felt, after reading countless headphone reviews, that these would be a good choice. I did not expect them to equal the Grado sound, and they are not. Then again, they are less than 1/3 the price of Grados. The comfort level is very, very good. I am occasionally bothered by the band pressing on my head, but that is after many hours of listening. Another reviewer of this line of Sonys complained that the wire going to the ear cup broke from taking the headphones on and off. Being forewarned was a good thing as I was able to pull some of the excess wire down so that the headphone flipping as I take them off did not put stress on the wire. These are designed to fold up and that is my only real complaint. The ear cup flips into the folded position when I take them off, and then requires a few seconds to flip them back into position before putting them on. This happens ALL the time and though the time involved is small, the irritation is not. It took about 50 hours to break them in, and the sound quality is fine for TV, movies, and background listening while I read. They are absolutely a good value and I would absolutely buy them again.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Never used an amp before, so I can't compare it to others, or for that matter what it's supposed to do.  I have it connected to my PC, using the built in sound card, and my Grado 80i.  The sound does appear a bit fuller than without it.      The main reason I decided I needed an amp was because there are some movie files I downloaded that are just too soft to hear.  That shouldn't be an issue anymore.
B000286SCO|5.0|As the title states one DVD is Images and Words live in Tokyo and the other is a sort of an \\"on the road\\" documentary. If you like \\"Images and Words\\" you'll probably like the DVD of the same name. The documentary mostly interviews and reminicses about this particular period in their career when apparently they had just broken through with \\"Pull Me Under\\" from Images and Words. Don't try to sit through both dvd's in one day just whenever the mood strikes you. There's probably about three hours worth of concerts, videos and interviews here. I have just found it more enjoyable in small amounts.
B0025KVLU6|4.0|Time has a funny way of making you think certain things were SO much better than they were and The White Album is a perfect example of this. Now, don't get me wrong; I still think this album is good but not the fantastic Beatles work I once believed it to be ;(
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I were temp seperated and i got this book and WOW oh WOW opened my eyes and let me see his love language along with mine. We are back together going strong! !100% reccommended!!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I guess I'm a kid at heart. Thought the movie with the special effects was just great. As usual it has a good moral story to it. Highly recommend it to all ages.
