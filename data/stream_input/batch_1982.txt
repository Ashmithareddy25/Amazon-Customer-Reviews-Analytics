0380729407|4.0|I'd like to start this review by getting the negatives out of the way first. My main problem with the book was how wordy it was at certain points, which I felt somewhat disrupted the flow of the novel. I would assume I'm in the minority about disliking this style, but I read purely for fun, not for themes and life lessons(though if a novel has them, as this certainly does, it's not a bad thing). Some of Mr. Halloway's long-winded perspective in the novel, his philosphy, slowed the book down. It's not that Bradbury was over descriptive in general (I read Stephen King, so I'm no stranger to descriptions), but it was the fact that he describes one thing with about a dozen different adjectives, which almost tempted me to skim through, even though it was such a short novel. Perhaps it's just that I wanted to get back to the exciting parts. I'd really love to say \\"screw it\\" and give this book 5 stars, but I pride myself on giving my honest opinions. Just these minor issues kept it from being 5 stars.<br /><br />As for the other 90% of the story, no doubt about it, it's very good. Not many books could be enjoyed equally by a teenager and a middle-aged reader, but I feel like this could. There's enough carnival-type fun and fantastic images for the young adult (as well as an older) reader to enjoy, while maintaining enough serious writing for an adult. It's quite a nice balance and Bradbury deserves a lot of credit here.<br /><br />I'd also like to say that I was pleased with how much horror/supernatural there is. I knew before going into this that it was considered a dark fantasy, but I didn't expect much genuine horror, but there was more than enough to be found. As for the fantasy parts, well, they were pretty great as well. Add in some supernatural and the coming-of-age feel to it, and you have a recipe for success.<br /><br />Overall, a lot of good imagination, mixed with some real life issues and struggles, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a unique book. A whole lot of story goes on in less than 300 pages, and this is one of them books that makes you realize how gratifying reading a good book can be.of story goes on in less than 300 pages, and this is one of them books that makes you realize how gratifying reading a good book can be.

B000NTPDSW|5.0|One of the most amazing sagas ine history, in one little case. What more can you say, its amazing!!! WOOW
B006LSZECO|4.0|So many twists and Turns! It is so hard to put down. It was so interesting to see a relationship dissected from each side. I would definitely recommend this easy and exciting read!!!!
0547995660|5.0|I haven't read all of it yet but I have read parts and I have read Gathering Blue (yes out of order) and Lois Lowry writes beautifully and the books plays out in front of me with so much detail.
B005JY1NIK|5.0|Great book, my daughter loves Rick Riordan! Why do you insist on wasting my time asking for more words ?
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Well, what I like about this HandyNote is that it's actually pretty handy. Ya' know it also can be usefull for documents I think...I dont know haha. I use this just for my journal and did you know you could even set a ' password' to your private stuff like say a journal, plans, or whatever fits your boot. I also use this as a the lovely helper of my ausome stories and poems too. But anyways it is fun to use and easy. :)
B0053O89JM|5.0|Great season, good conclusion to the series. La la la la di da da la la di dah da la!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book full of  action and suspense I will definitely read the other books  in the series Suzanne is a great author
B000007XUQ|5.0|This CD brought back a lot of great memories of Christmases past. Love and miss the voice of Karen Carpenter.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have never read a Nicolas Sparks book before...it was the first book I purchased on my new Kindle Fire.. I loved the story and didn't see the ending coming at all, and when I got to the letter that Carly wrote to Katie I sobbed...as it would be exactly what my best friend had asked of me six years ago before she died, she knew that she wanted someone to love her family as she did.  At that time I had know idea that she knew how ours lives go, but she did and I have kept my promise to this day.  Mike and I were married a little over a year ago and I can't imagine my life any different...a wonderful husband, three adult children and seven grandchildren...life is good!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I took me a while to get into this book, and trust me, it's not because it had kinky sex in it. But after a while the characters grow on you. Very clever ending making you want to read the second and third books. Would've given it five, but for me it was a little slow, though perhaps necessary. Maybe it is my mood that is holding me back from a five star. All in all definitely worth the time and money.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Ever since I purchased my Kindle Fire HD it has been a race to find anti virus protection. Since reading all the positive reviews on avast I downloaded/installed, the security is awesome and complete! Get this app, it' s a must!!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think everyone should read this book!!  I have recommended this book to several 6th grade teachers.  The story is so compassionate and so real.  It is a true heart warming story..amazing.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Another strong effort by this former American Idol winner. Of course, be has to wonder about some of her precious relationships given the nature of a few of her songs.
1481251880|5.0|Loved the characters and the story. Definitely a page turner..couldnt put it down. Her other ones were also a great read.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|The book wasn't awful but it wasn't great either. Basically it's a porn with a story line and not a terribly great story line.  I'm guessing that if your looking into this book that your interested in that stuff. If not, then I wouldn't look any further.  The Crossfire books are the first books I've read by Day, so I can't tell you if these are better than her other ones. I can tell you that I thought Reflected was better than the first, Bared. Reflected was just lacking and it was as if she was making it all about the sex. I didn't feel the love just desperation to screw. The characters had no depth or personality. I know it can't be easy to write a story in one perspective and capture every emotion from every character. But ya have to give us something. I don't want to feel sorry for them, but I want to relate to them on some level. Reflected pretty much summed everything up for me so I won't be getting the third book, nor do I think Day can give me anything new that I haven't already figured out.
0765325950|5.0|The book is well written and flows so intensely that it was difficult to put down when it was tome to go to sleep.  As it was I spent a whole Sunday readying almost half the book just to finish, could not stop.  It is a plot that keeps you guessing and had me on the edge of my sleep.  The crown jewel of the Wheel of Time series.<br />  As for everyone giving it one star reviews because of the delayed e-book release.  Really??????  I always remember the hard cover coming out first and then the paperback being released later.  There is no doubt I will get the e-book, but you can't have a Kindle edition autographed by the author :)

B005IQZB14|5.0|This is the first book i read that made me cry.  I found it to be really touching.  Cheryl has excellent writing skills and i couldn't put it down.  A recommended read.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the proof part is not really there. I understand that Eben being normal after his illness is nothing short of a miracle but the book does not floor me and convince me that this is proof. The story is a testament to the love of his family for him and the bond that they share. I am glad he recovered the way he did and is on a mission to share his story and message with others.  But, believing in the afterlife is very personal and from my point of view will never be able to be proven, that is the whole point of faith. People are going to fade in and out of believing and always have that question mark hovering in the background, that is our human condition.<br />  With that point made, his publicist is a wizard, because I likely would not have given the book a second look if it was not named as such. \\"Proof of Heaven\\" simple, sticky and brilliant from a marketing standpoint. I had come back to it on Amazon many times and hovered over the buy button, but could not justify getting it because I knew that I would likely not be convinced of the proof. I ended up getting it as a Christmas gift and was pleased to be able to read it. Great job!<br />  People have different path's that they travel thru life and after reading his story I feel that Eben had been yearning for his sense of wholeness all his life. I am glad that he was able to come to terms with everything. The quote \\"Seek and ye shall find\\" comes to my mind. Looking back on the story it seems that Eben never allowed himself to do this seeking with his conscious around, so his self took the opportunity to do it when his conscience was out of commission. With such a determined personality, I think that it was likely the only time in his life that it could happen. Overall I liked it and would recommend it to people looking for uplifting stories.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /> Eben has written a good story about his near death experience from his professional technical point of view which changed his outlook on life. It is worth reading if you are looking for something to believe in or need further reinforcement. If you come to the book a skeptic, you will likely remain a skeptic.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved reading the Hunger Games even after I saw the movie first!<br />The book is always better.<br />I love having my kindle read to me while I drive to and from work.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have enjoyed all of John Grisham's books. It's an easy read and entertaining with a diffferent twist. This was my first Kindle read and I like it.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|I rented this movie for my wife as a surprise and she enjoyed it thoroughly! It has music, and better than most similar movies, it has a capella music! While the plot wasnt exactly the best, it was entertaining enough to keep watching. I felt like the movie couldve been longer to develop some of the relationships of the main character, and even more background on how or why the other characters were important in the movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I want to first say that I don't understand all of the folks that rated this book 1 Star! Are you kidding me? There's definitely much worse books out there than this. I've seen other reviews where people have picked this book apart for every little detail and my question is who made everyone editors all of a sudden? Until you all write your own book I really don't think anyone is entitled to say what the author should and shouldn't do with her own book. Just don't read it, it's that simple and move on!  After hearing mixed reviews about it, and seeing numerous coworkers stuck to this book, I decided to try it out and I'm glad that I did. This book is so intriguing and interesting that I read all 3 books in one week!  It reminded me of the Twilight Series just an 'Adult' Version. There was so much emotion displayed throughout the entire book That I couldnt put it down. I commend E L James for this Trilogy and I can say that this is probably one of the best reads..better yet best romance novels I've read in a long time if not ever. I will be definitely recommending these books to all my friends and family! Keep up the Good Work! Looking Forward to more books in the future and me and my other half will definitely be seeing the movie when it comes out!

B001PJRAUS|5.0|What an orignal and fun idea to place a modern woman back in time to Jane Austen's Sense an d Sensibility. Loved all the characters and how they stay on track about the book but lovely Amanda starts mucking it all up.  You get some insight into the characters that the original book never gave and it makes for a great series.  I highly recommend it!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Keeps to the book, has great emotional characters which the actors stay true to.  I have seen many different productions but this movie blows them all out of the water- I have never seen someone take on Mr. Rochester so perfectly.  Highly recommended for any Jane Eyre fan!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The English certainly have a way with words.  They can insult you and you still feel like you are being respected!  I was drawn into the drama, the characters and the acting.  The dynamic between the &#34;upper&#34; and &#34;lower&#34; parts of the house makes for a very interesting series with many different storylines.  All of this with no vulgar language and the absence of either &#34;in-your-face&#34; sex or sexual sugestiveness make it an extremely worthwhile watch.  If only American TV would take notice.
B004WYT06U|5.0|Another great book by Pink.  He is a must read for all managers.  You will find his work very interesting and it will help you with making decisions in this hectic business world.

B009CFXRQ8|5.0|This film has an impact on me on every level: story, characters, visuals, action, cinematography, atmosphere.<br /><br />I cared about Theo and his ex-wife, the girl and her child, Jasper and his wife. I cared what happened to them. As far as film-making goes, this movie is a powerhouse. It's got some of the most intense action scenes I've ever seen filmed, and several of the best ones done in one continuous shot, which has the effect of making them seem all the more brutal and immediate.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Strange and fun, didn't want to put it down. can't wait to see the movie! Hope the movie does it justice.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved &#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34;. It is different from all the other books, which makes it unique and a great reading experience. It is written very well and even though the main character never really describes himself, the author gives you such a detailed impression of him. This book is amazing.
1250006341|5.0|I gave this as a present for fans of the show and it was well received. It's a beautiful book filled with photographs and insider information about the popular show.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great book.  Keeps you wondering till the end.  I would recommend this to everyone I know.  Even though it is Stephen King, it is not scary like most of his books are.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I love Castle and season three is one of the best. Great character development, great cast, great stories and exceptional writing. I highly recommend the entire Castle experience.
030758836X|4.0|After reading many reviews about the book I expected a more exciting experience. The book was very good, well written but... it did not grabbed all my attention at all, it was kind of &#34;slow&#34; but a good reading anyway.

B007THA4FI|4.0|The story started a little slow and there was some predictability in the plot.  However, overall, a nice job from this author
B00004SCX6|1.0|Good grief, they call this music?  Someone gave me this CD, and I gave it as a donation to a thrift store, but regret not tossing it in the trash.  This floozy named Britney Spears and her musical style is for the immature and morally vacant and is so lacking in content and class.  Sorry, I can't stand this gal's music (good grief I said that word again...THIS IS NOT MUSIC, IT'S GARBAGE).  Worth ZERO stars, but I regretfully am forced to rank it with a minimum of 1 star....ISH!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Okay, I thought I was coming to the end of the series.  About halfway through, I realized that Book Five would have to be VERY long to tie up all the loose story lines left in the book.  Plus I kept waiting for more to happen beyond the wall.  I whizzed through this so I could finally find out how everyone and everything come to a conclusion. (Now on to my review of Book Five)
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Many times The Greatest Hits albums are not the artist's greatest hits; however, in this case these are truly Phil Collins' best songs the ones that we all remember.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I began this book thinking that the story was finally ending.  Instead, I am just left with more questions.  And now I find out that the next book may or may not be out by 2015?!?  I sincerely hope that the author is experiencing excellent health or has made arrangements for someone else to finish this series in case he meets an untimely end. I will be very put out if there is not some resolution to some of the plot lines and some well-deserved someupptances for certain characters.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It was my first ever item I bought from Amazon. The item delivered few days earlier than the indicated deadline. The package is good and the item is the same as described. Have not opened it yet to play, but already know the movie is awesome. Thanks Amazon!
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I didn't know anything about Firefly until I started hearing the buzz about this movie &#34;Serenity&#34;. I saw the movie in the theater and have been a raving Firefly fan ever since. If you're already a fan then you know what I mean. If you're not then I urge you to give it a try. I don't recommend that you do it the way I did. Instead, borrow or rent episode 1. Shiny!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Getting more copies for friends. It is understandable with actionable ideas.  I am happier already after reading it.  It combines other authors work which I respect.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I can't say enough good stuff about Firefly. It's part science fiction; part western; and all heart. The characters are what makes this tale come to life. They are all complex and multidimensional, and they all complement each other. Fox's mishandling of this series will go down in history as one of the biggest bungles of all time.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was so good and I loved the characters so much that I read it and then immediately began reading it again. Couldn't get enough.
B005LAII80|5.0|I also did not expect much but it was a good movie. One of the better action movies I have watched over the past few months.<br /><br />I would opt for the bluray because the computer effects are worth it. It's more bloody than I expected but entertaining and funny.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless - Loved the mystery and romance. Fell in love with the characters and I couldn't put it down. One of my all time favorites.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|Funny and stressful. I'm not going to summarize the book if you need to entertain yourself for a few hours this is a good choice.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|The game works wonderfully.  I love the graphics and the functionality.  I started with the free version and was impressed enough to purchase the next level.  However, there are still the four colors/levels but have a second screen for each.  These don't seem to be as challenging as the free version though.  Maybe its me, maybe I'm just getting better with all the practice but I will be flying through these pretty quickly.
0439023513|4.0|I enjoyed how fast-paced Mockingjay was compared to the second book, Catching Fire, which I also read after seeing the Hunger Games movie.  The Hunger Games trilogy centers around a teenage Appalachian girl who becomes the symbol of a rebellion in a  post-apocalypse North American country named Panem.  Panem, for students of history, has its fictional roots in tales of Greece, Sparta, and ancient Rome.<br /><br />In this book, I like the complexity of the main character's emotions, the overall message of the devastation of war, the role of the media in propaganda, and how opposing sides in war can be strangely similar.  Peeta and Gail are fantastic supporting characters - although Gail is a little one-sided at times.  Haymitch is a well rounded, manipulative, cynical but caring booze addict, and I kept seeing actor Malcolm MacDowell utter his lines.  In this book, we finally get to know his back-story and what motivates his addition and need to control.  Just about the time things start to get a little slow-paced or stale, the writer rips the rug out from under us - although foreshadowing abounds as well and adult readers should pick up on it fairly easily.<br /><br />If I had kids, I would read the Hunger Games triology along with them and have a discussion about it.  There is A LOT of violence in these books, complex motivations, and politics.  I want to stress being cautious about letting kids under the age of 16 read it without the guidance of a discussion group, English class teacher, or parent.  This is not Harry Potter by a long shot.  The last third of the book takes place in a Syria-like civil war for control of the Capitol.  Aside from the suspenseful plotline, I would want to make sure that whoever reads the book is able to grasp the overall message of nonviolence within the subtext.<br /><br />Finally, Kateniss is a great study in character writing for any author that wants to make his or her lead female character strong, vulnerable, and action-oriented.A shrinking violet she is not!

B002M9WW30|4.0|I'll admit. I never really thought that I'd ever invest in the Rocky series. I think I only saw Rocky IV in the theatre, and I thought that their entry of the home robot maid was just stupid as hell, so I dismissed the thought of ever looking into any of the other Rocky films.<br /><br />But, Stallone is Rocky, just as he is Rambo.  So, since I always seem to scan various Blu-Ray releases of classic films here on Amazon, I saw the complete box set of all the Rocky films for just a penny less than twenty bucks, I mindlessly clicked \\"yes\\" to order it on the spot. Afterwards, I contacted a few of my friends and family to ask them if having all the Rocky films on Blu-Ray was a value at about twenty bucks. Everybody said Yes! And, then they all said that they would jump on the deal too.<br /><br />But, the next day, everybody called or text me and said that this Rocky box set on Blu-ray was selling for 44 dollars on Amazon. Not $19.99. As I checked on Amazon, it was true. The price suddenly jumped to 44 dollars, the very next day.<br /><br />I now have to show everybody my invoice to prove that I only got billed for $19.99 for my box set.  If Amazon waited just one more day before they raised the price to 44 dollars, I'm sure that they would have sold another three box sets that day.<br /><br />So, lucky me, huh?
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Great read. Quick. Some parts are slow and there is a lot more emotion and inner dialogue, which makes the book drag on for a while. Otherwise great & interesting
B004W89N72|5.0|My Kindle goes everywhere with me and I find it's a convenient way to get reminded of an appointment when I have my nose buried in a book.  It's an easy to use application too.

B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Downton Abbey never disappoints. The story line is compelling, the acting superb, and the characters are well-developed. Every time an episode ends, my husband and I are left wanting more. Sometimes evil versus good is painted a bit too black and white and needs a bit of gray; many humans who are selfish or sly or demanding or self-willed can also do something unselfish or kind occasionally. Some can also find through self-examination how to end the self-inflicted wounds, which come from self-seeking thoughts and actions, and thus become better people. I like the show's willingness to have characters grow and change, but a couple characters do seem to remain evil personified. Overall, I recommend the show as a good study in human nature, a grand view of a bygone era, and an entertaining story.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|This is not a suitable replacement for the original kindle fire charger. The light turns red for 15 minutes, then claim the battery is still too, then I plugged it in for another, fifteen minutes and it said the same thing. This went on for several hours. i am still trying to replace my bent charger.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Two Graves is another great read about Agent Pendergast. Was waiting for this book as the last book ended in suspense. Hard to put this one down.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Great book. Keeps you guessing. Third book got a little slow at times, but otherwise a very exciting read. Will have to read more of her books.
B004X75RK4|3.0|Generally, I liked this movie. Sandra Bullock gives her regular rom-com performance and Ryan Reynolds is passable as her assistant-turned-amour. They had absolutely no chemistry together though, and their getting together is kind of unbelievable. And that end of the movie kiss, where you're supposed to believe anything is possible? Appeared completely fake and over the top to me. All in all, a good piece of fluff to watch when you have absolutely nothing else better to do.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|my husband and I both loved this ! It had lot  of action for him and some romance go..me! would  watch again
B0090XLDKY|5.0|What is there not to love about his movie? It's fantastic and one I could watch over and over again.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is a giant challenge, it drags you in and you think you are too smart for this, then it grabs you and become like a moth<br />to a flame. Can't get enough.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Entertaining! The kids are able to improve their abilities to understand the principles of geometry and physics with this game.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This movie was really cute and my 9 year old daughter enjoyed it, she just wanted it to have a little bit longer.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The kids really enjoy it because of it's entertainment value, and it also helps to improve their understanding of the principles of physics and geometry..
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Simply put... I love these! They sound great and they are affordable!  For the first time, I can really hear my vocals gut through in mixes. They even sound good while connected to my Roland v drum set.  I like these so much that I plan on ordering about 3 more pair!
0811879542|5.0|Even at 19 months old, my son could follow some of the simple instructions in this book and loves to see what's on the next page.  Loved it so much we had to buy it as a gift for a our son's 2 year old friend.
B000LX0RBI|5.0|In this listeners' opinion. Best &#34;band&#34; album from that period. All 4 members of Kiss shine throughout. A must for any new Kiss fan.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|If you've seen the previews, you've seen the movie.  Not much happens in between, and it's rather predictable and boring.  My husband and I were able to predict every single thing in the movie by the end of the first 30 minutes.
B000FC10WU|5.0|The Body in the Library is another of Agatha Christie's excellent books. This book with Miss Marple shines because the reader is always kept guessing even though the clues are usually evident. I would highly recommend this book.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|It was well written, but not very fast paced.  It was interesting to learn that much detail about the 60s, as obviously a lot of research went into the book.  A good read, if you don't mind a slower moving book
B0088P2A7A|5.0|The interface adaption for the Kindle Fire works very well on the smaller footprint compared to the standard laptop/desktop interface.
B0053O89KG|4.0|The first season was fantastic.  Then it started to go down hill.  Where did all the comedy go?  Sure it's a cops and robbers series, but so are 90% of all the TV shows.  The interspersed family comedy kept it from becoming a run of the mill C&R show.  Season 4 finally brought back some of that comedy.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie really caught me off guard, its set up is simple but it offers great moments of both brutal bleak action and strong characterization from the two leads and the villian. It never looses it focus with no truly weak parts.
B0053O89IS|5.0|It was just as good as all the rest.  WOW what a cliff hanger.  Now I can't wait for the next season to come out.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|It is a Lego product.  You get what you pay for.  Well, okay, Lego's are over priced generally speaking.  But the product if full Lego quality and works as expected.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the first app game I got for my new Kindle and is a fun eye candy game.. and don't feel like I wasted my time playing as does take some brain power to do..sort of a mini brain exercise..even got my husband to play and he never does games..works perfect with the touch screen.. Loaded easy and quick.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't wait until February when it begins again! Exciting  new characters  and  interesting  character development  in the veterans ... I love me some  Daryl.... redneck badass :)
B0086700CM|5.0|for a simple concept -- just run, jump, turn, jump, run -- this game is surprisingly compelling. Occasionally on my Kindle Fire 1st gen, the graphics get a bit herky, likely when cache memory is getting backed up.  A reboot &amp; then restart of the game always takes care of it. If you don't have many background apps running, or have more than 512 M of ram, this will likely never be an issue. Leaderboards are neat -- see where you rank. Don't be put off from downloading (as I nearly was) by the &quot;in App purchasing&quot; -- that's only there if you want to BUY additional coins, beyond what you collect in the game itself -- 2,500 coins is 99&cent;, but in about 3 or 4 days playing, you'll likely collect 30 to 50,000 coins, so there's plenty fun &amp; upgrades available without buying anything.<br />  So install it -- then run, jump, turn -- &amp; don't forget to Duck!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Once again, not sure if I my Motorola is just old but this game would never load.  I guess it is unfair of me to only give this game one star so I really cannot rate something that I have never been able to play.
B004J88SGC|4.0|Un concierto disfrutable del principio al fin. Excelente puesta en escena muy buen sonido y la calidad de un grande como Billy Joel
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I watch American Idol every year and, as one would expect, some finalists are better than others.  The main reason for the purchase was the song &#34;Home&#34;.  After listening to the complete CD, I can hardly wait until another comes out by Phillip.  Love his voice.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is an awesome app, but my only problem is that kindle fire doesn't have the cool updates iPod, iPad, etc. has. But still awesome. TeamLava, if you are reading this, I have a new update idea: being able to trade dragons with other people!
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|My daughter has been playing this game for 2 months, and was loving it. She had built up so much money and so many dragons. It is her favorite game. This morning the game reset itself, and will not sync back with facebook. All of her hard work is lost, and she is a heartbroken 6 year old now. :(
B000N0W9WO|5.0|Just watch it again in last Christmas. Good timing to enjoy the movie. Should watch it every christmas. it's good.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Beautifully restored, terrific bonus features, insightful commentary. I couldn't ask for more!  Anyone who is a fan of film classics, and certainly all Godfather fans, need to get this set. Mark my words, you won't be disappointed.
B008476HBM|5.0|Two hundred years after it was written this book remains as witty, insightful and entertaining as ever.  I cannot recommend it enough!
B006WZIETG|5.0|Great sequel haven't actually seen it on blu ray so i can't comment about quality sound but the price was very good value, y i bought was the fact that i have already first film.....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|wow. cool game,  loved it. didn't want to put it down but didn't want it to end.  Good story not to hard not to easy it was such good entertainment.  I'm spoiler I want more! MORE!!!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Ended up watching this series in a matter of a couple of days.  Truly a well-written and engaging show.  Not for minors though.
B00004Z459|5.0|I have liked every Linkin Park album they have released, some more than others.  However, this has got to be by far the best album, in my opinion.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|If you enjoy the old standard songs you will love this CD.<br />The recording quality is outstanding, having been recorded at Capitol Studio.<br />The back up musicians are superb, Diana Krall, Joe Walsh, terrific string band.<br />The song listings are terrific and the addition of &#34;My Valentine&#34; is fabulous.<br />If I could call My Valentine an instant Old Standard I would.<br />Just reinforces what a terrific song writer and musician Paul McCartney is.<br />I was blown away by the whole thing. Have since bought the DVD of it too.
B000069CWE|5.0|I thought this was a very unique album.  Thought they should have waited until they had a few more albums under their belt instead of releasing this after &#34;Hybrid Theory&#34;, or better yet, maybe they should revisit this idea with a few of their new tracks?  Favorite song, by far?  My December.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My wife and I both like CASTLE.  We had been watching reruns on another channel and missed all of season 5 thru 12/31/12. So we downloaded these to catch up.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|A book to help inspire your life.  A must read for anyone who is depressed.  It is a book you can reread whenever you need it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|By now, if you had already read the other reviews from amazon, it is largely in opposite poles. On one hand, it is a piece of garbage. On the other hand it is a good fiction romance novel, better than Harlequin romance series. Rather than give you a reason to buy or not to buy the book, I tell you some things I like and I didn't like. Reason why is novels cater to different people. What you think is garbage is actually appealing to someone else. Also, I haven't read all of it (only a 100 pages). So take that into consideration.<br />Let me list what I didn't like. First, I didn't like the main character Anastasia Steele. She wasn't interesting enough. To compare, let's take Libby Day from Gillian Flynn's novel, Dark Places (which by the way, if you haven't read it, read it please. Promise it is a good novel). What they both have in common is they are immature. Anastasia Steele sees this handsome man and she asks him about his sex life. What all Libby Day wanted is money. But Libby Day is more interesting than Anastasia Steele because we, the readers, see a darker thought in Libby Day's mind about people, especially the ones who are investigating her case. Anastasia Steele's thoughts are similar to an eighteen year old. Second thing, and I hate the most, is how the female and male characters fall in love. It is just too cliche (star-crossed lovers) and unrealistic. I think that cliche should be ban.<br />What I like about the novel is the mysterious nature of Christian Grey. I like to know his past. Someone that likes BDSM probably has a funny past and as far as I read, I could only speculate. But I'm pretty sure the next two novels had explained his past but I'm not there yet because I'm distracted reading other novels, such as Dark Places.<br />There you have it. If you haven't read it, please read it and form your own opinion. But for the curious people, I think it is just boring all together.
0761169431|4.0|Sent it to my college student to make him smile . He LOVED Origami as a kid and this picked up his spirits to have the Star Wars version.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|A CONTINUATION OF THE GREAT SERIES FOLLOWS IN LINE WITH THE OTHER BOOKS OF THE SERIES.  HOPE THIS WILL CONTINUE.
0761171703|5.0|The pictures are beautiful ... they capture the full spectrum of emotions.  I'll enjoy it again, and again, and again.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy this game it's a nice way to relax when the kids lay down and I need to unwind.
B009MO5960|4.0|OK zombie flicks are kind of a sick addiction, but .... what can I say?  Seeing the undead get made dead is entertaining stuff. This entry in the series delivers what it's supposed to. Fans of the series will be OK with it as I am. Heck I'm already waiting for the next one. It's too late for me, I'm infected! Save your selves! Never, EVER watch any of this series if you don't want to be infected also.  Project Alice will go on .......
B000EYK4GW|5.0|One of my favorite disney movies and the part with Jumbo always makes me cry. Love Dumbo and so glad i know own it on DVD
B002KS1IJC|4.0|OK, I streamed this movie based on the of the good reviews it has. BOY HOWDY! were they ever correct! I can't wait to get this on Blu Ray! I'm going to buy this critter. I always have a spot on my Sci-Fi shelf for films as good as it is.<br /><br />23Jan2015 I ended up buying the Blu Ray of this which is very very good imho.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I love the cast and the story. not too gruesome and hilarious! love this movie and so glad i now own it on dvd
B00APUQPX6|5.0|I chose this movie because I have watched the others and have enjoyed them as well.  Besides you just have to love the Teradactile (sp) type squirrel and the nut.<br /><br />The dialog is super and entertaining.<br /><br />I would caution anyone that has a data limitation, I have a Kindle Fire HD, and when i downloaded the HD version of the movie, it took a little over 3 gig, the clarity was supurb but be aware.<br /><br />I'm 68 and really enjoyed it for it's entertainment, I would think children would be a given.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This app I downloaded for my son to play but one day I found myself playing it and fell in love. Lol. This app teaches you actual technical things like keys and most importantly tempo. I say it's a must download.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I picked this item because I wanted an alarm clock on my Kindle Fire HD, what was on the machine simply would not wake me up because the volumn was so low, and my hearing in the 4000 range is impacting my ability to hear.<br /><br />This makes the noise and gets louder, there is no way I would sleep through it.<br /><br />Just be aware, I would have given it a 5 star rating, if not for one failing that I considered.  That failing, you cannot chose a date in the future, which I believe is wrong and a key point the company missed.  You can select any day out that is within 7 days and that is all, or you can do repeats.<br /><br />I wrote to the company, they said thank you and they would consider upgrading and installing the ability to key in a date in the future, say, December 31, 2015, so if you fell asleep and wanted to celebrate New Years it would wake you up.<br /><br />No idea as to when or if they will actually do this.  I would then give it a full 5 stars.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Personally, I think this is a good book for young readers with an active mind. It is filled with adventure, action, and magic. If you like the stories of the Greek gods, you're going to love this series.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I thought it was a book for teenagers but it had a surprising twist that held my interest, it was light reading and a good story. A great read for the holidays
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Watched this on HBO and saved it on my DVR.  Now I want to make sure I never lose this so I am buying the DVD to keep.  He was such a wonderful and loving man.  His wife just adored him as you can tell and this documentary led me to look into his son's music.  Check it out, he sounds just like his dad.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I liked the sideburns in the song about piper.it was radical.me liked this lovely house of Hermes and Ares. Cool.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Very imaginative and love that her sisters are involved in the story. I thought like in the movie, sophie would turn back in some instances, but she didn't. I also thought the idea of putting in the modern world was cool too. I didn't think it would be exactly the same as the movie. But the book is good in it's on way.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Excellent!!!!!!  Probably recommend more to women than men. Only the Brits can make good choices for Masterpiece<br />Theatre. I love it!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|What I expected from Clint Eastwood, a wonderful performance and entertaining to boot!  A good family movie.  Think I will actually purchase this one for my movie collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not a dull moment. Way better than watching any movie because everything looks the way I want it to. Sorry it had to end, but on to book two.
B009PAETCG|1.0|I have a kindle fire, and I really like soccer. So i go to the app store, and I find this app with an amazing four and a half stars. So I got interested. I read the top three reviews and thought, &quot;hey this looks cool. I'm gonna download it!&quot; So I get all excited, and I download it. Well I start  to play the game, and it seems neat so far. Then it's the same thing only with a goalie. It was very boring to me. Then, I finish the game and it says, &quot;PLAY&quot;so I pushed PLAY. It froze and it never responded. Then it just force closed. I was like, &quot;wait what?&quot; So I uninstalled it..... i don't like it but you can give it.  Chance. Not recommended though.......
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Always been a Nicholas Sparks fan! This book was great from beginning to end and held my attention, as always did not let me down!!
159413586X|4.0|but it felt rushed. would really like to know more about Katniss & Peeta's life during the fifteen years before they had children up until they had children. re-read this book three times as well!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I was somewhat leery of purchasing this case based on some reviews regarding the angle of the kindle standing in the case.  I've had no issues with the angle.  I can usually adjust my body position to find a good viewing angle.  I really like the upright standing feature also.
1594135851|5.0|thought this was the best of the three! re-read this book three times & still loving it! looking forward to the movie!!
0765325950|4.0|Brandon did a good job wrapping things up.  It was a monumental task and glad he got it done.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />The acceleration of the plotlines continued to an epic conclusion.<br />This book is action packed.<br />It stayed true to RJ's original vision.<br />Did not get too philosophical unlike some other (cough Goodkind) books I've read recently.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />Too much fighting.  I can't take yet another cavalry charge.<br />Lost a little bit of the personal touch and build up to some epic confrontations.<br />Some plot lines were just wrapped up too fast.  There are some great heroic moments in here which just don't get enough screen time.<br />Some mysteries are not answered.<br />Climax to end of story only left about 10 pages to \\"cool down\\".  After 14 books I would have hoped for a little more \\"what happened after\\".<br /><br />The Bottom Line:<br /><br />If you've stuck it out this far with the series, this is a must read.  Bit of a slog (so much fighting) but Brandon Sanderson makes a heroic effort to finally end the biggest fantasy series ever written and that's no small task.  If you've never read Wheel of Time, it's a big commitment to read all 14 but worth it, especially if you can read them in succession (now possible).
0441013597|5.0|All the hype about the book turned out to be true.  The story has a great plot, with the climax executed very well.  This is truly one of the best science fiction books of all time.  Its a rather long read, but so are many classics.  Recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|For weeks now it's been popping up the new update icon. When I go to download the update the app store says I have the latest version. What the heck? Update or no update? I'm getting annoyed with the notification popping up. Love the app though. I have it on my phone, tablet, and desktop so that I can make and access Notre wherever and whenever I need to.
1400069289|4.0|This book has very interesting stuff in it and I totally recommend this to people who are interested to learn more about habits.
B0099G3I96|2.0|Sounds all synthesized.  I could not find a single song that I enjoyed listening to.  Can I get my money back?
B002APU580|5.0|I enjoy this version of Pride and Prejudice more than others that have come out. It's one of my favourite movies and Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen are both fantastic.
0753539470|5.0|I listened to the audio version and will listen to it again. It has encouraged me to be mindful of negative mental habits and to turn them around.
B008LY9AWG|3.0|Doesn't deliver the fast pace which is normally noted in a Harry Bosch novel.  But the indepth knowledge that leads to the end is evident.
030758836X|1.0|This is a great read, until 3/4 of the way through.  The characters were very interesting, the plot and all its twists was exciting.  And then, nothing.  I don't want to give away anything, but when I read a book, I expect AN ENDING!!  Not a cookie-cutter everyone gets what they want and all live happily ever after ending; I love it when writers take me by surprise - but this book just ends, and I seriously turned the last page and kept looking for missing pages, thinking my copy must have been damaged.  But nope.  Just over and that's it.  Very disappointing and feels like I just wasted my time.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box is an intelligent thriller which delivers the suspence and closure that Harry Bosch has needed for may years.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I love the artistry of this film, it's epic feel, it's weirdness, it's scope. I've never read the book so I didn't know what I was in for when I first watched it, it's a bit theatrical sure but the film entices you right away with it's multitude of odd characters and the fact that clearly there's never been anything out there like it, there still isn't. At its heart its story is a simple one, the choosen one,to lead his men to glory, goes thorough a journey of self discovery to triumph in the end. The effects are dated but the film still engages. I would be really interest if Peter Jackson were to direct a remake.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I was spellbound! I could not stop watching. The acting is superb! I cannot wait for Season 2 and 3.
B0072OFM28|4.0|I remember this series when it originally aired. This collection of DVD's is well produced and was a great bargin for the price.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|It was a wonderful movie and I think everyone should watch this especially young couples with children.We need more husbands to take the spiritual leadership in the home just like these guys in this movie.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This item was purchased to give as gift to a Bruno Mars fan, so far she has really enjoyed and recommends it to other Bruno fans.
B008N1V11U|5.0|IN THIS GAME YOU CAN GO WHERE EVER YOU WANT, ride the bat pod, rid the bat wing, good around with your cape, beat up bad guys, go into buildings, and use your grappling hook gun and batawings!
B005LCECU6|5.0|For all those Rush fans out there, this is a great CD of one of there original US shows. The song selection is interesting, several Rush songs are played which I have not seen before. A definite must for the Rush fans out there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this series. If you can look past the sex there is a fantastic story line. I would recommend this book to ANYONE.
B00377Z0Y4|4.0|This CD is a must for any Tull fans, it is a great collection of Tull Christmas music. I listen all year round and it doesn't get old.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was hard to follow, I thought it made \\"Katniss\\" look weak, when the author took so much time making her strong.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|This item was purchased to give as gift to a fan of fantasy/ Sy Fy movies, so far he has really enjoyed and recommends it to other fans.
B00846REIS|4.0|Very well written, hard to put down. A real page turner<br />Had me hooked from the start, so ready to read the rest of the series.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This item was purchased to give as gift to a Bruno Mars fan, so far she has really enjoyed and recommends it to other Bruno fans.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|it is amazing.  We loved it. We would recommend both to adults and teen-agers.  It is very enjoyable.  Very well done
B004HW7JMO|4.0|I remember this series when it originally aired. This collection of DVD's is well produced and was a great bargin for the price.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Monotonous at the beginning; previous &#34;Bourne movies&#34; had more action. I was expecting more from this movie other than a motorcycle chase.
B000002P2V|5.0|This CD adds several tracks to the original release. A definite must for any Who fan. Sound quality and song selection is excellent.
0316227706|5.0|These photos are hilarious and somehow heartwarming. I love seeing how much fun all the dogs are having in the water! I really admire the photography skills and the creativity it took to create this wonderful book. I flip through it again and again when I need a smile.<br /><br />It's printed on good quality paper, showing off the photographs well.
B007EECSFA|5.0|What an amazing writer!!!  I traveled last June and picked up House at Riverton (her best book) at the airport.  Since then I have read all of her books and can't wait for the next.  What is most impressive to me is her ability to bring every character and setting to life.  Sometimes you feel like she is decribing you and your deepest thoughts.  Ms Morton writes without using any 'curse' words, which I find refreshing...an escape from cable TV's obsession with street language.  Instead she uses language that recognizes the reader as intelligent and imaginative.  I envy the reader who is making this purchase and on page one.  ENJOY THE RIDE!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Every December, I pull out my stack of Christmas videos, from &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34; to &#34;Bad Santa&#34; and start watching them daily until Christmas Day. I'm always on the lookout for a new contender. There are a lot of movies that pertain to Christmas, but many of them aren't appealing to anyone beyond the age of 3-5. This one can be enjoyed by all ages. Wonderful animation and an appealing story, with good &#34;acting&#34; by the voice actors. This will definitely be in the annual rotation from now on.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The film shooting was OK, but it was logically flawed, thus not very exciting. The actors and actress are fine.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Like all the other apps I've downloaded for our Kindle Fire bought Nov. 2012 it works<br />beautifully. I hope Amazon comes up with an Android app in the near future that will allow us<br />to receive live CNN and ESPN broadcasts through Xfinity while we are on trips with our Kindle. So far<br />there is nothing available for Adobe or Windows Silverlight. But until they do we're satisfied with what we can get<br />and we can get a lot.
4871878309|5.0|the book describes the very basic thing that we are going to do daily which is to solve the problem. It's way is simple but fundamental, and it emphasis it again and again. It greatly helped my thinking process and would serve the basic onto other books targeting at problem solving.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|Received for Christmas. Great packing, great product. Lived up to the hype around it.  Just remember how old these guys are!
B008WCP2PG|5.0|The story was average at best, but the dance numbers were incredible! I wish there had been more since they were the most entertaining thing about the whole film.
B002V092B0|5.0|This book confirmed what I have always believed - If you can think it you can do it!<br />Neuroplasticity is a fascinating subject. And I really enjoyed this book.<br />I would also recommend &#34;The Brain that changes itself - Norman Doidge.
6305128952|5.0|This film touches on so many aspects of daily life. Traumatic event, children, family, marriage, love, pets...it was perfect in so many ways because regardless of how &#34;Hollywood&#34; it was, it still had realistic moments and ending, most of all. It stays pretty true to the novel (from what I can remember since I read it so long ago) and Robert Redford is incredible as both a supporting actor and director.
B002TJLEY6|5.0|I found this subject matter in the book (neuroplasticity) very well researced and very well written.<br />It has peaked my curiousity in the subject of brain, neuroplasticity and the mind. And I am slowly working my way towards reading many more books on neuroplasticity. I also find it very inspiring, especially the realization that the brain is never to old to develop new neural pathways.

0762777931|5.0|First, I'd like to respond to a previous reviewer's comments because I want to ensure you, dear reader, aren't dissuaded from this powerful journey. A reviewer mentioned that Kris is a) a potty mouth, and b) too political. On the first point, Kris is hysterical. She is real, approachable, honest, vulnerable, and completely down to earth. Sure, she uses some colorful language, but it is always in a way to help drive a point home with a little laughter (for example, the bit on enemas and colonics left me gasping for breath between tears of laughter).<br /><br />Regarding the complaint that she is too political, I just don't get it. I read that comment prior to reading the book, so I was watching out for something that support the reviewer's comments. I never found it. Does Kris talk about the environment? Sure. Does she stress the importance of recycling, organic eating, and taking an empowered approach to your health? Abso-f'ing-lutely. But at no point does she cross any kind of political line or engage in finger pointing. I think the reviewer just didn't connect with her approach.<br /><br />That said, this book changed my life. It's as simple as that. Kris Carr reached into my heart, and it unlocked something in me that's been desperately trying to get out. I have been giving this book to friends, family, and co-workers because I think it's that important.<br /><br />Empowered, empathetic, enthusiastic, engaging, ecstatic. This book, and Kris, are all that and more.<br /><br />I start her 21-day cleanse in a few days, but over the last month or so I've gone almost entirely vegan. I juice every day. And I have never felt better in my entire life.<br /><br />Treat yourself to something magical and invest in this book.

B005LAIHCW|3.0|Producers of \\"House at the End of the Street\\" couldn't buy better advertising for their low-budget thriller. First, the movie is given a boost by the success of \\"The Hunger Games\\" and the spotlight it shined on Jennifer Lawrence. Secondly, Lawrence wins a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical a mere five days after the movie's release on Blu-ray and DVD. This further guarantees that more people who weren't familiar with the star now are and will likely give any project she's in a chance.<br /><br />Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) and her mother (Elisabeth Shue) move to the suburbs to start a new life. They lease a home in an upper-middle class neighborhood that's affordable to them because of the horrific murders that took place in the house next door. A few years before, a girl killed her mother and father there before running out into the woods and disappearing. She's been long thought dead, but some residents believe she still lives in the woods next to the neighborhood. Elissa befriends the killer's brother, Ryan (Max Thieriot), against her mother's wishes. She soon discovers the boy might be hiding a dark secret from her and the rest of the town.<br /><br />If \\"House at the End of the Street\\" is guilty of anything, it's trying to be everything to everyone. It feels as if writers David Loucka and Jonathan Mostow couldn't figure out what genre they wanted to tackle, so they just touched on all of them. While sometimes this can work, it really creates a schizophrenic vibe here. They throw in everything AND the kitchen sink. We get a pinch of slasher films, a handful of ingredients from both thriller and suspense movies, and it gets topped off with the recently overused twist ending everyone's come to expect from these types of movies.<br /><br />The pacing is erratic under the helm of director Mark Tonderai. However, I'll give credit where credit is due. The camerawork helps to redeem it by capturing a sense of creepy nostalgia thanks to cinematographer Miroslaw Baszak. He chose to use a type of film that makes it look grainy and similar to older classic horror movies.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence puts forth her best effort in the role of flirty and rebellious teen Elissa. Max Thieriot is convincing as the enigmatic Ryan. He's both creepy and charming at the same time, which can be hard to pull off by some actors. Elisabeth Shue does an adequate job portraying the concerned, yet distant mother. Although, she sometimes feels a little disconnected from the role.<br /><br />The high-definition audio and video transfer for the movie is excellent. The grainy, \\"real\\" film look isn't tainted by the Blu-ray treatment. The 5.1 surround mix gives viewers plenty of sounds to immerse themselves in. This is very much a movie that relies on loud bumps and noises for its scares and won't let the home audience down in that respect.<br /><br />There's not much here when it comes to bonus material for the \\"House at the End of the Street\\" Blu-ray. They include a near-10-minute\\"making of\\" featurette entitled \\"Journey Into Terror: Inside 'House at the End of the Street,'\\" and a theatrical trailer. It also features the unrated and theatrical version of the movie.<br /><br />I'm not going to say that \\"House at the End of the Street\\" doesn't have some enjoyable moments or isn't worth your time. It's just more of the same thing we've come to expect from these types of films. It's like a meal you walk away from full but not satisfied. Nothing you ate was necessarily bad, it just wasn't fantastic. It's one of those PG-13 thriller films we'll see being played repeatedly on the Lifetime Movie Network in a year or so.Miroslaw Baszak.

0802473156|5.0|I have been married for quite a few years, and this book was recommended to me by my pastor. There is no more clear and simple way to communicate this information than the author has done. I knew some of these things, and it gave me some self-realization when reading this book. I was completely in-sync with his writing and his examples. I have lived some of these things and the book really felt like it was written for me. There is no way this book was actually written for me, thus my only conclusion is Dr. Gary Chapman is a very smart man and a knows how to communicate better than most.<br /><br />If you feel like your spouse doesn't love you like you think they should, read this book and suggest they do the same.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very well written.  I saw the movie first (usually I do the opposite) and then read the book.  It has a cohesive, exciting story with lots of action, some horror, and even a touch of romance.  I can't wait to read the next two books in this series!

0451228731|2.0|I'll give the author credit for an inventive idea and story, but I would say there really are no good parts of this book. I kept waiting for something good to happen for the protagonists but this book is a progressive series of increasingly violent victories for the bad guys. Several parts made me appalled and sick to my stomach. There's even some pornographic scenarios. The whole book kept me intrigued because it's an interesting idea, but it's too unrealistic, violent and sexually perverse for my taste. So there ya go.

0679720200|5.0|\\"The Stranger\\" is one of those strange, but incredibly fascinating works that you likely read in high school, college, or on another occasion because everyone else around you read this during high school or college. If you are not one of the following, I would highly suggest joining the crowd on this one and reading this incredibly short novel of 123 pages (that's right, just 123 pages).<br /><br />Dealing with the death of his mother at the beginning of the story, we show that Monsieur Meursault is not a very emotional person and does not express signs of sorrow or weakness as he loses someone who should reasonably be an important person in his life. His life takes an unexpected turn when he engages in a shooting on a beach for no apparent reason, though there is a chance that he could have been threatened by the alleged victims knife. His emotion and his faith are put into question throughout the remaining half of the book.<br /><br />\\"The Stranger\\" is bound to make you think. You wonder about the enigma that is Meursault and why he thinks the way he does, why he is not an emotional individual, and why he shows no faith in God. There is even a bit of comic relief in the story with the character of Salamano and his dog, both of which are blind. Definitely check this book out if for some reason you were not introduced to it in high school.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Better than trhe first one. It's the perfect mix of history and novel. I can't wait for the next book!!!!!
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Drive to me was one of those movies that I saw the previews for and thought I'd eventually see.  Essentially, however, I forgot about it until I was looking for a movie to watch the other night.  I decided to watch it, mainly because it was \\"free\\" as part of a streaming subscription.  I'm glad I finally watched this movie.<br /><br />The first ten minutes or so has little dialogue, and it's mainly the main character (Gosling) doing his job as a for-hire getaway driver.  It's a great scene as the movie focuses on the driver's method of listening to police radio, watching traffic, and showing off his driving skills.<br /><br />After that, the first half of the movie is quiet, almost maddeningly so.  The Driver seems to be somewhat uncomfortable outside of working in a garage and stunt-driving, which are basically his jobs outside of being a getaway driver.  He meets his neighbor and her son when her car breaks down, and the scenes with him and her conversing are almost awkward.  He says very little and seems to be unsure of himself, very much the opposite of how sure he is as a driver.<br /><br />Just as the Driver and Irene are getting close, she tells him that her husband is coming home from prison.  True to his character, the Driver doesn't say anything, doesn't change his facial expression.  There is a very tense moment when the Driver meets the husband, Standard, in the hallway.  You get the feeling that Standard can be a mean guy.<br /><br />Once the Driver finds out that Irene and her son are in danger due to some people who are after Standard, he steps in to be the getaway driver for a heist during which Standard will get the money to pay off those after him and his family.  It's at this point where the movie goes from quiet to very violent, almost without warning.<br /><br />The last half of the movie is a 180 from the quiet, subdued first half.  We learn more about the characters of Bryan Cranston, Ron Perlman, and a surprising Albert Brooks.  It seems thatthe Driver is more than meets the eye as he takes on some nasty people while trying to protect Irene and her son.  There's a scene in an elevator that is one of the most violent I've seen in a long time; a scene in which we see a very different side of the quiet Driver.<br /><br />There's a buildup to a final confrontation between the Driver and the nasty folks.  Much blood is shed, and the body count rises.  Overall, what happens is both cringe-worthy and satisfying.<br /><br />This is very entertaining movie with some great performaances by Gosling, Cranston, Perlman, and Brooks.  As I mentioned, the shift in the film from quiet to violent happens in a matter of seconds.  Everything the Driver does is to protect Irene and her son, and the first part of the movie is necessary to see why he does what he does.<br /><br />I recommend this movie, and I encourage anyone who watches it to pay attention to the first half.  Don't let the quiet, subdued theme fool you.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The story is a little messed up and maybe a little slow in the middle, but when you reach the end of the book, your mouth drops open. Totally unexpected.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|Having the books on Kindle was great - they were incredibly easy to read this way.  No huge books to lug around and easy to just lay in bed or on the couch and read for hours.  Plus, when you're done with one, it's easily on to the next one!  The only thing I hated about having it on Kindle was that it made the maps almost impossible to easily reference.  I read the fifth book in hardback, and it was awesome to just be able to look at the maps, or go back to a previous chapter to remember what is going on with a particular character.  With the Kindle version, you get the convenience of avoiding awkward hardbacks or huge paperbacks, BUT you lose the ability to easily skip around.

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I liked the first half of the book and the author could have wrapped it up nicely half way through and had a great book! However the author didn't seem to know when to STOP WRITING!!!! I began to ask myself after every page would this book ever ever end? Jeesh...some self control would have made this a great read.I however will not be buying anything else from this author unless the page count is low.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I might very well be wrong but something in the last chapter in this latest Jack Ryan Novel makes me think it could be the last one. If that would be the case, well all good things must come to an end. Unfortunately - if it is so - this novel is not one of the best in this series. It hasn't quite the vigour of the earlier novels about Jack Ryan. Could it be because Clancy is using co-authors also here? In spite of that I give the book 4 stars since Clancy is always Clancy and I would sure miss both him and Jack Ryan. In this novel it's his son - Jack Jr - who is the main character and he hasn't grown into his father's shoes yet. The plot is typical Clancy, high politics, high tech and lots of action. This time the theme is cyber warfare which shows that Clancy as usual is up to date with events. Even the very special language used by so called cyber punks seems corret. The battle scenes are also written with insight and realism as usual. The love story is a little bit awkwardly described (perhaps not Clancy's strongest side). The prose is also a little bit different, not always as crisp as usual but that could be because of the co-author, Mark Greaney. In spite of some negative criticism I can still recommend this book to all the usual fans of techno thrillers in general and of Tom Clancy in particular. Finally, do the USA really need a new president as long as Jack Ryan stays in the White House.<br />Best regards<br />Hans Nilsson<br />Stockholm 14.01.2013

B00AEFXL5W|5.0|BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S won Hank Mancini a pair of music Oscars. Audrey Hepburn also was nominated for Best Actress.<br /><br />There's many legends (some verifiable) surrounding this classic drama:<br />1.) Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play call girl Holly, but she thought the role would be bad for her image.<br />2.) Jean Seberg and Kim Novak were considered for Holly before the film's producers decided on Miss Hepburn.<br />3.) Steve McQueen was offered George Peppard's part but was unavailable.<br />4.) The film doesn't follow Truman Copote's story.<br />5.) It DOES follow his story.<br />6.) 19-year-old Holly likes herb, has a dirty mouth, once terminated a pregnancy and dates both men and women.<br />7.) Her brother Fred also isn't \\"straight.\\"<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />Sight aione verifies the obvious:<br />Hepburn's rare beauty is ideally enhanced by an exquisitely accessorized black sheath dress. Mr. Peppard is equally as pulchritudinous and they make a gorgeous couple. Their bittersweet rainy alleyway scene at story's end is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history.<br /><br />Mickey Rooney is highly annoying (and incredibly un-P.C.) in his comic relief role as a mule-toothed, Coke bottle eyeglass-wearing Oriental. Buddy Ebsen defines acting perfection as Holly's abandoned husband, come from the country to NYC to bring his \\"Lullamae\\" home.<br /><br />Blake Edwards' early masterpiece is a complex tale of a mercurial young lady who freely accepts cash gifts from men, is most at ease in overcrowded, swinging cocktail parties, and at her neurotic worst when alone with the one man she's attracted to, a handsome young author of a single book who struggles to write anything new. Theirs is a beautiful love story with tragic overtones that's one of this reviewer's all-time favorite movies.

B003FHMHPQ|4.0|I was skeptical about some of the information in the book and really would like further elaboration on much of the book, but I understand that the 'field' of research is still new and going through much discovery. It is helpful to find this information and feel that there are explanations to our place in the world beyond what we've been told through many channels of traditional information.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|This series was my first venture into using the Kindle and it raised my expectations so much that unfortunately nothing else has lived up to it. What a shame Stieg Larson is no longer with us. The characters he created have gone forever when so much more could have been done with them.
145210655X|5.0|This is a must have for Star Wars Fans!!  Very funny illustrations and a cute story of what if Darth Vader would have been around to raise Luke!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Just plain awesome, really enjoyed and would highly recommend to anyone interested in how events unfolded on the day bin Laden was brought to justice.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is a definite improvement over the last installment.  In this adventure we're returned to current times and Mitch Rapp is back in good form as the no-nonsense terrorist hunter.  A bout with amnesia from a head injury goes to show he's human and adds a dose of reality and recognition that he's not as young anymore.  I think fans of the series will be pleased with this effort.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|While most certainly a work of fiction, The Racketeer is a quick and fun read that held my attention from beginning to end.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I bought this on the kindle app I have on my tablet and read it in a few hours. I had heard it had received great reviews and I knew people who had raved about it. It is very insightful and I discovered that my love language is &#34;Quality Time&#34;, which made perfect sense. I would highly suggest reading this; it is fantastic.
B000000OXH|5.0|Christmas gift for my father, first on his list.  CD and case arrived in time and unharmed.  I loved it and Dad loved it more.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Lately I've found myself groaning at kids movies full of fart jokes and face palming at adult comedies that really just force the R-rating to get teenage viewers... this movie is a nice go between, there are a jokes that are purely centered around kids, but they are actually well done, then there are the much more hidden adult jokes that kids will laugh at, but they aren't going to understand them. And the fact that there's a Seinfeld reference is pretty stinkin cool!<br /><br />The point of this review is to say this: If you are tired of watching kid shows with overacted jokes, this movie is a GREAT option to make you laugh WITH your kids!
B000000OMB|5.0|Christmas gift for my father, first on his list.  CD and case arrived in time and unharmed.  I loved it and Dad loved it more.
B0019EXZYE|5.0|What's not to like about this movie if you like action this is among some of the best anyone can get.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I believe this is the best, by far, comic book based movie ever.  It had it all.  No weaknesses. None.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Spent the Christmas break catching up on the series.  Can not wait for season 3 to resume.  The disk were in great shape, no skipping like I sometimes get when purchasing seasons on sale.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Meh. The movie never really had an ending. It was just over without tying up many of the story-lines.<br />There's some time I'll never get back....
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My husband and I spent Christmas break catching up on the Walking Dead Series.  Lets just say I am glad to be married so I can snuggle up after watching zombies attack.  LOL  The disk were of good quality, no complaints.
B0024F13NC|5.0|My fiance has had this cd on his wishlist for a while and he's quite a music critic.  He was pretty happy to get it for Christmas!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love these books. This one was good but it felt very slow at the beginning and super fast paced at the end. Still liked it though.
B005LAIISA|4.0|we love these types of movies.  great family pick.  laughed allot at the squirrel per usual with Ice Age.  four year old was a little scared of the monkey
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. This is the best out of the series. Katniss shows her true colors not just to her loved ones but to all of Panel. Best ending ever. Go Peeta!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I picked this book because it was free and honestly, I can see why. It's not that it was a &#34;Bad&#34; book, rather it was very predictable in it's nature. Plus I found some situations and emotions portrayed were extremely far fetched, even for a romance novel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Could hardly put the book down until I finished the last sentence.  It left me wanting more.  I love that about a good book.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book starts out slow but if you stay with it, there are many twist… I really enjoy the last 40%!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|My family loves this game.  We play together and help each other to expand the zoo.  However, we are at a point in the game that the only way to expand or add to our zoo is to spend real money for peanuts (the games currency).  We have tried twice to purchase these peanuts only to have the transaction processed without actually receiving the peanuts in our account.  Amazon refunded us our money, but we now have a game that we cannot play because we need to spend real money to play a free game.  I would also caution parents to turn on parental controls because the game encourages you to purchase these fake peanuts for real money with options as high as $99.00 with only 1 click.  Fun game to play with too many frustrating obstacles.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Just amazing great book you will love it like I did it took me 2 days to read it it just amazing
B009I2UH2W|5.0|I already owned other Power Jolts for the 30-pin iDevices.  This product is a must have for every iDevice user.  It's 10W supportability do work amazing with your lightning iDevices. Full recommended!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have Spider installed on three devices. I have had no problems with any of them. A fast game helps clear the mind.
0525953728|3.0|In the early pages of No Easy Day, Mark Owens discusses his desire to create a book<br />which will inspire young men to follow his footsteps as a Navy SEAL. This follows<br />he his own reading of a book about the SEALS he read while in middle school. Unfortunately<br />he hits the mark. This book is written at a middle school level. Much of it is<br />awkwardly written and difficult to follow. Owens' stultifying use of acronyms is<br />maddening. The continuity is difficult to follow because no dates are used.<br />One has to respect Owens' attempt to maintain security but to include at<br />least the year of certain events or some detail of SEAL training wouldn't<br />have violated national security.<br /><br />Were if not for the subject matter, this book would be easily forgettable.<br />As it is it's a murky disappointment.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved this book... once again Stephen King amazes. Highly recommend this book to any and that love a great story.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I found this biographical story as exciting as the plots of many of my favorite novels.  The story is very inspiring and was personally motivating.  It has coused me to do a great deal of personal introspection and motivated me to take steps to improve myself!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|It was so amazing to read I loved it. All the books were perfect. I am so glad I read them all.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great Music!  I enjoy this music so much.  Oh my Gosh!  I just loved it!  Is there anything new out there.  I just love this stuff.  I really do.  WoW!
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|this is a marginal movie with little to offer in comedy 9 more words required 5 more words required 1
B00122HPDU|3.0|Would love to hear an entire album of original songs ... still waiting.  If you know of one from Buble, just let me know.
0765325950|5.0|I've been loosely following the reviewers of this product and am saddened by the childishness of the entire situation.  I won't spend my time discussing the ridiculousness of what everyone who has been giving this book 1 star have done but instead give those people who actually want and use the rating system a reliable evaluation of what we come here for... A Memory of Light, Book 14 of the Wheel of Time Series.<br /><br />Besides, those of you who remember hefting these tomes around in your backpack and sneaking 5 minutes between class in the halls of your high school will understand that the purchase of this book in Hardback is worth the nostalgia if nothing else! As a mater of fact, I'm now a high school teacher so I've come full-circle and find myself doing the same thing now!<br /><br />Although I have been very busy over the past 3 days, I've managed to squeeze in 300 pages so far.  If the first 3rd of this book is any indication of how fantastic the conclusion of this magnificent series is going to be,then the \\"15 year\\" old me will not be disappointed. I've been waiting 22 years for this instillation and have not been disappointing!<br /><br />If you are a fan of this series, don't let the 1 star rating from the wool-heads who are complaining about the e-book release fool you, the story wrap-up has been extraordinary so far and I already plan to re-read the series on the merits of this book!<br /><br />So, if you are a true Robert Jordan fan, give praise to Brandon Sanderson and Harriet McDougal and thanks for their efforts in completing this series with the love and panache it truly deserves!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this a while ago and recently saw the movie. Both were awesome. Charlie has problems, which are revealed throughtout the story and is told by letters written to someone you never meet. The story covers every topic from sex, drugs, belonging, and homosexuality. Charlie befriends a group of older teenagers who take him down the path where he discovers that they hold dark secrets and pasts as well, and he's not so different as he originally imagined. Through his friendships, he learns that he's not alone and how to deal with the trauma he experienced as a child. Beautifully written and brutally honest. The characters come to life on the page, and the ending was satifying without the cliche of HEA.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|The Newtown shooting prompted me to read this book.  It's a fascinating tale of raising a school shooter from the perspective of his mother who was an ambivalent parent to begin with and then had this odd child who would not bond with her.  The writing caught me up in the story right away and gave me a lot to think about.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. Awesome story at a bargain price. I look forward to reading the remaining series books. Excellent job Mr. Howey. Thank you! Thisseties was recommended to me and I will pass that advice on to all my friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy ready kept my attention will probably purchase the other two volumes.Great Christmas gift for my wife and I. we both are enjoying it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey contains so many stories on so many levels.  Each character has a story.  There interactions are all a story.  There's the story of culture- the culture of the building, aristocracy, furnishings, clothing, customs, attitudes.  There's the story of World War I and how it affected the British.  There's the story of how the lower classes mixed with the upper classes.  The story of how the Americans and British got along.  Just marvelous.  Even my boyfriend loves it and looks forward to watching it.<br />We caught up to the 3rd season by spending 2 weeks watching the first 2 seasons and both looked forward to each new episode.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was ok for me.  I've read most of Grisham's books, and this one moved rather slowly.  Perhaps the character's quiet demeanor also subdued my reaction, but I never received the rush of his other novels.
B0086700CM|3.0|this game seems to speed up as you move on. that is something I truely hate that because I cant make it far in the game. So that sucks.  otherwise the game is good but I also hate it when you get to a turn and it just cuts off. I don't suggest this app if you give up easily. But I do NOT GIVE UP EASILY!!
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This game is fun but there is not enough room to place things and its all on one side. Other then that I love this game. Get it. It rocks!!!
B0077EBWVI|1.0|My husband and I laughed all through this movie.  So stupid.  We are going to watch the original just to get the bad acting and songs out of our heads.  DUMB.  DUMB!  Leave the 80s movies alone and quit making remakes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have to make sure I have a chunk of time to spare before I start this game.  It is really hard to put down.  I only wish there was an explanation of the objectives, i.e. how to go about meeting some of the challenges that are not self-explanatory.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this book. Cute, funny and romantic. I will definitely recommending this book to everyone. I have finished reading this book in one sitting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really fun challenge for us visual learners.  I love searching for the patterns before I begin connecting the dots.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the best book I've read in FOREVER!!! Definitely a mature readers book though. Characters and plot well thought out =) Go Charlie!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game!  It has given me something in common with my students and gives them a chance to teach me something.  Since I could not locate any &#34;directions&#34; on how to play the game, I ask my students.  I think they enjoy instructing me, and they have recommended other games for me to try.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This application is a must. It tells you how long you can read, listen, watch, or play your various applications. So far no problems at all.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Graphics and gameplay are great! only gotta pay for the rest of the game. but not bad and would pay for the rest as I think its well worth it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved loved this book..confused on the ending though. I am writing to read the third book. I'm sure it will be full of surprises!!!!
B00594XOZU|4.0|Great app for messaging without sharing personal info or phone numbers. Could use updates, including:<br /><br />-Delete specific messages off your phone, not just whole conversations.<br />-Log out feature.<br />-Ability to turn notifications off (not just sounds, the actual notification... like a &#34;silent&#34; mode)<br />-More smileys :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Me and my little brothers love it (: It is a money loving challenging game and am always on it my mom has to take it for me to stop playing it
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This classic novel was totally enjoyable!  Although I have seen and loved several movie versions of the story, I had not read the novel since I was a young schoolgirl.  Having watched my favorite version of the movie, I got the bug to reread the book, so I ordered the Kindle edition.  It was wonderful!  The illustrations were beautifully done, and the book was a fun and quick read.  It doesn't get much better than this - a Christmas classic, which takes only a short time to read, added to my enjoyment of the holiday season.  Five stars for this classic!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Admittedly I have a pretty high bar for comedy, and this came nowhere close. The best I can say about this movie was that it was okay. It's seemed like Bring it on/Step Up meets Glee. Which means it was a little cheesy, sophomoric, and predictable but it had a few laughs. Nothing great though. Maybe worth a rental, but wouldn't have been worth the movie price for me. Some have touted it as the best comedy of the year. No way. I recently watched End of Watch and although not a comedy it was a lot funnier than this movie, if that says anything. Maybe it just wasn't for me.
B003VIW8DK|3.0|Like T.Rex is Marc Bolan, Roxy Music is Brian Ferry. But for some reason I never figured out, Brian Ferry is at his best when he's part of Roxy Music. His solo albums are great, but never reach the perfection of Avalon or Stranded, my two favourite Roxy Music albums.<br /><br />Olympia is almost a Roxy Music album: The jacket reminds us of the very first album, the intro of \\"You can dance\\" is taken directly from Avalon's \\"True to life\\", three members of Roxy Music are one some tracks (MacKay, Manzanera, Brian Eno) and we can sometimes feel the spirit of the later edition of Roxy Music, say, from Manifesto.<br /><br />But it is not a Roxy Music album. Most tracks are good, but they will wear out after a while. I don't think I'll revisit Olympia in 10 years from now. But I will still be listening to Roxy Music.<br /><br />Brian Ferry, we love you but, for our pleasure, stick with Roxy Music. Your old pals know your the boss, but boy, do they know how to extract the best of you.<br /><br />That said, Olympia is still way above the crowd, well worth one's attention.
B005LAJ212|5.0|This is a fascinating story, engaging me from beginning to end and holding my interest.  As it is long, there is perhaps unavoidably some sense of repetitiveness in some ways, since a key story line is our heroine's dealing with the people who brought about her father's death one by one over a long list.  Highly recommended.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is amazing.  After reading the it, I tried losing wheat from my diet.  Bingo! I lost two pounds. That's the way I used to lose weight.  Had it not been for the holiday season and WANTING to eat some cookies and breads I would have continued.  I am trying to get back on it now that the sweets and breads are gone, but doing it slowly.  In the process I find that the author is correct in saying that eating wheat makes you hungry soon after eating it, but I also find that I get hungry soon after eating white potatoes.  He addresses all of this in the comprehensive book.  Well researched, well written and well thought out.  I highly recommend this book to anyone suffering from weight issues to ill health issues.
B006LSZECO|2.0|None of this will have a spoiler, but clearly some things can be guessed by reading the review.<br /><br />I like the format - the dueling journal entries, so it is he said she said.<br />I like the voice of the two - I think the author breathes life into each<br /><br />It starts off okay and then really gets interesting about half way through.  It is really quite good for a while.  Then it starts to lose focus and fall off before ending in a steaming pile.<br />I am all for unclear endings.  I am all for things not working out in books.  But not so much with pulp like this . . . this is a summer page turner, not an emotional tale that is deep.  You got to wrap things up here.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series should be required reading for high school students. Some of my friends thought the &#34;gore&#34; was a bit much but I really didn't find it to be any worse than today's popular video games.
B001XUY818|1.0|Slow moving plot, unecessary vulgarity and poor performances by the cast made this movie a waste of time and money.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I enjoy this app. I've had no problems running it on my Kindle Fire HD whatsoever. Anyone concerned about in-game, real money transactions can simply adjust their settings, on the Kindle Fire HD, to require a password for app purchases.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|So I'm not in to dancing movies and don't watch Glee etc.  This movie is just hilarious and Anna Kendrick is amazing.  If you don't think this is one of the best movies ever made, I would love to find out how and why.  I saw a reviewer compare it to Glee, I don't think you get it. This movie makes fun of stuff like that and puts it down.  It's just a great movie, I've probably watched it 14 times in the last 2 weeks.  I ended up buying it after I rented it.
B004J5366M|5.0|I discovered this album through the free single 'We Don't Eat'. This was a great discovery and I enjoyed every bit of this album. Definitely an artist to discover.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Cute and original fable about preteen boy and girl who fall in love and run away together in 1965 New England, causing the adults in the entire region to get their knickers in a twist and  propose electroshock therapy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of the games are fairly easy, but enjoyable. It's a nice way to pass time. It is a good variety of games and difficulties. It is a little difficult to earn enough points to unlock the games. Some of the games I don't enjoy, but tire of playing the same ones all the time.
B001NHNG64|4.0|When I decided to read the Jack Reacher series, I decided to start with the first and read them in the sequence that they were written.  So far (two), I really like Jack Reacher and think that he is the best of his genre.  The action starts on the first page and doesn't let up until &#34;The End&#34;.  Great action scenes, great characters, lotsa interesting plot twists.<br /><br />My only knock against Lee Child and his Jack Reacher character, based on the first two novels, is that the scenarios in both novels were instigated by highly improbably coincidences.  In #1, Reacher decides to get off a bus in a strange town, and is immediately caught up in an action-packed drama that has no relation to him, except that he was there.  In #2, he's walking by a dry cleaner and helps a woman carry her packages to her car, and gets kidnapped along with the woman.  To compound matters, the authorities think he was in on the kidnapping, so they're after him too!  Not that it really detracts from the overall work of fiction, but I'll be interested in seeing if this trend continues.<br /><br />Bottom line, great read, great fun, looking forward to the next one!
B001CZJKS0|5.0|Got this as a gift for my girlfriend and we both love it! We are both huge Michael Myers fans!<br /><br />Product was just as described and was received very quickly! A+!
0307742997|4.0|I'm always looking for exciting new authors.  I enjoyed \\"The Snowman\\" very much and will read more in the Harry Hole series.  Lots of twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat.  Great read!!!
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I can' really say I hate it because I have never heard it. I am trying to receive my local NPR station. I contacted Tunein but they haven't gotten back to me.
0307744434|5.0|So, I guess I'm not alone in loving this book and I wanted to talk about it without sounding clichéd but it truly is magical.  I don't think I've ever read a book like this.  While at its heart, it's a romantic tale involving star-crossed lovers, its so so much more.  Morgenstern's style is refreshing and crisp.  She crafts a world that is so visual that you can absolutely picture these fantastical elements.  At times the reader isn't supposed to completely grasp what's going on because the characters themselves are in the same situation.  Rest assured everything is fleshed out and ends extremely well.  Overall a simply fantastic book.
B003WMA7BU|2.0|I appreciate the idea behind this story but the execution failed severely. It needs editing. It is so flawed that I think the author may have not even proofread. I suggest that you skip this book and watch the film which is magnificent.
B000002KGT|5.0|Many consider Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumors\\" to be one of the ultimate pop / rock albums ever recorded.  The album was a huge hit when it was released back in 1977 and remains one of the biggest sellers of all time 35 years later.  Time has been kind to most of this material and \\"Rumors\\" still holds up well today.  The mix of songwriting styles of Buckingham, Nicks, and McVie never melded better than on this album.  The only weak track on the disc in my opinion is the McVie penned \\"Oh Daddy\\" and even that one is ok.  The inner turmoil that was going on between the couples in the band is today well documented.  At the time the honestly and humanness of the lyrics show through and I think is a big part of the reason this album resonated with so many people.  The pain, anger, and occasional joy reflected in these songs are about as honest as it gets.  This album is a classic that deserves all of the sales that it achieved.
B0013FSXT6|3.0|I love Kubrick, or I'd never have given this film three stars.<br /><br />I just didn't enjoy it. I've know reviews have decried those who devalued this movie because the sexual side of it never really materialized...or that there was too much hype given to the marriage dynamic of Kidman and Cruise working on the same movie. There are those who felt the work was too polarizing.<br /><br />But, simply put, this is not a great film.<br /><br />In fact, it came close to being horribly boring. I love Kubrick, and I hate saying this, but I had a lot of trouble staying involved with this movie.  It's just not very good.<br /><br />I've noticed that many of the Kubrick camp fight viciously on this film, and I think I know why: great films like [[ASIN:B001DJLCPE Dr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000Q66J1M 2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000UJ48WC The Shining [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000UJ48UO Full Metal Jacket [Blu-ray]]] don't need protecting...Kubrick's art is evident in them, and so what if some don't see it?<br /><br />But here? Kubrick missed it on this one, and it it simply has to go into the \\"Loss\\" column, and that hurts.  So they attack the naysayers, citing our inability to discern what art is, that we just don't \\"get\\" the film's message, that the film was too subtle, and on and on.<br /><br />But folks, it's just slow moving, and it promised much more than it gave. It wan't that it wasn't sexy--it wasn't, but that isn't the problem--it was that when all was said and done the movie never gelled, never achieved what I perceive to be the Stanley Kubrick vision, a unique story that only he could have told.  Given the plot (I'm not going to; it's at the top of the page), a lot of directors could have come up with a more compelling movie.<br /><br />I definitely COULD get into the fact that Cruise's character was obsessed with the fact that his wife considered cheating on him.  But that's just clever casting...is there anyone who couldn't see Cruise--the perfect Tom Cruise, control freak that he is--obsessing over something like that?<br /><br />Beyond that, the \\"night out\\" and the unusual events that followed, should have made for a more powerful movie.  But that's it: it didn't.  If you recite the things that happen during this movie it sounds exciting...so why wasn't it?<br /><br />I don't feel that every director owes me, and that they must keep me \\"amused,\\" but I do believe a story should be compelling.  A slow pace CAN BE forceful...certainly, \\"2001\\" was slow, but it was EXTREMELY powerful.<br /><br />This wasn't, and that's the problem.e perfect Tom Cruise, control freak that he is--obsessing over something like that?<br /><br />Beyond that, the \\"night out\\" and the unusual events that followed, should have made for a more powerful movie.

B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a very interesting read I didn't want to put  it down or could have had a little more action or drama in it but it was still a very good book
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I purchased two (2) Kindle Fires as Christmas presents for my 6 and 4 year old daughters. They LOVE this game.  I walked them through the tutorial steps and helped them start up their \\"island\\", but after that they are both able to play without my help.<br /><br />Great, fun app!
0765325950|3.0|Even though the battle scenes were drawn out a lot longer than necessary, I was still set to give this book 5 stars until I got to the last 50 pages or so, and I don't mean the last 50 pages that are in the book, I mean the 50 or more that should be here but aren't!!!  I remember \\"Return of the King\\" got some flack for having way too much info after the final battle was over and the heroes had won.  This book has exactly the opposite problem!  Chapter 37 alone ran for 190 pages, but after the battle is over, we get a whole 16 pages to let us know what happened to those who survived.  Basically you're left with a sense of \\"these people lived, these died, this one gets a job they don't want...\\" and that's about it.  Nicola's foretelling that everyone has theorized over for years??? Isn't fulfilled.  There is one sentence in there that maybe hints at how it might be, but not really.  And considering that at least one of the girls from that foretelling has a country to rule, I don't see how it's going to be fulfilled at all with the info we're given.  Nothing on whether or not the Seanchan ever come to realize their Empress can actually channel, etc.  We are left with a TON of unanswered questions that just left me feeling hollow.  I waited 23 years for this???  If there was another book yet to come, even a short story, I could handle it. This book itself was really well done, but those of us who have stuck with this series through the past 2 decades (and there was some rough going in the middle of that) deserve a more solid telling of what happens after than we're given.  Part of me wishes I'd done like my brother and given up on the whole thing around book 10.<br /><br />And I thought the Inheritance Trilogy butchered its ending.  So I'll give it 3 stars because other than the missing pages that should be in the epilogue, it was a good read.  This book is about 50 pages shy of perfection.  What a waste!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|the way it was written threw me off when i first started reading it, but by the end i really enjoyed the book!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book has been a great help as I've used it to help me in the formatting of two books for the kindle. I will be using it again, without doubt, and have recommended it to those friends of mine considering kindle publishing in the future. I am very pleased with it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again another great book from Sparks.  I wish the ending would have been extended a little bit more. Besides that , I can't wait to see the movie!
B000FC1MM8|4.0|We are in the middle of reading it and so far it is quite good.  It's keeping our attention at the moment, as looking forward to the end.
B004I744AS|5.0|Of course, I always enjoyed learning new vocabulary and daily snippets of history, news, and interesting quotes.  I also like that it includes a weather report.  Good stuff, definitely recommend!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I really loved this book I mean for real this book I wish house of hades would come sooner ,but I wished the book had not finished so suddenly
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am very much enjoying have this app on my tablet and phone.  Accessing my books (and having the bookmarks intact between devices) is a very nice perk when waiting -- anywhere!  Thank you for making it accessible for Android users :)
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Only started playing because my daughters talked about it so much. But it is cute and fun.  Plus being forced to watch the show I know who the ponies are.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Every album is amazing by Barbra! No one can sing the way she does. I probably have all her albums and love them all. She is the best!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was lucky enough to receive an ARC of HOPELESS from Ms. Hoover and I have to say, after reading SLAMMED and POINT OF RETREAT, I was super excited to get started on her next release.  I have to mention that the only reason it took me TWO nights to read HOPELESS was because I have a two-month-old, but for the rest of you, it will be a One-Nighter...be ready for a night with no sleep!!<br /><br />HOPELESS touches on some very serious subject matter, but Hoover writes it in such a way that you won't be discouraged to continue reading.  If anything, she gets you so deeply involved with the characters lives that you want to know where the storyline is going, no...more like you NEED to know where the storyline is going.  I think I was literally sitting on edge, waiting to find out what piece of the puzzle Sky and Holder would uncover next.<br /><br />Sky is almost your typical heroine, well, except for the no phone, no T.V. and no internet rules at her house, but she does have an unhealthy obsession for chocolate.  The bad reputation aside, she is a strong young lady with a good head on her shoulders.  Then she meets Holder, Dean Holder, who has her wanting to break the rules...just a little.  Holder is your misunderstood, crush-worthy bad-boy who has you wishing that you could rewind time and head back to high school.<br /><br />The interactions between Holder and Sky are so innocent, yet intense and as the story unwinds, and the layers start peeling away, you begin to find out how deep that connection really is, and as the story unravels, you will be left speechless.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover has mastered her craft.  If this is what she has in store for her readers, well, Mark her down as ONE TO WATCH!!<br /><br />Enjoy and Happy Reading!!
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I guess it's working as intended. But it's not very intuitive. I don't feel like I have control over its functions and the Help information isn't very helpful. If I can find someone more familiar with it, I'll ask for some coaching. Otherwise I'll delete it.
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|These are some of her best of the best songs. Yes you can get them one at a time on iTunes but get them all at once and enjoy.
0765325950|1.0|I'll buy the book when it comes out in a format I can enjoy on my digital devices.  It's 2013, I'm not going to lug around a hardback to read on the bus, in line at the grocery, or even snuggled in bed.  Invariably, my tablet is more comfortable to read on, rather than having a hulking physical book perched on my chest or weighing down my backpack.  Even my phone, with its small screen, is a more desirable reading device since I'm always carrying it, and it lets me *not* carry a huge book around that only serves one purpose.<br /><br />Super lame that the ebook version is delayed so long.  I love the series, but I can damn well wait to purchase A Memory of Light--my reading list is a mile long, and I've waited so long for this series to end, I can stand to wait a few more months.  I would have enjoyed reading the book as soon as possible, though, and there's no reason for the ebook to not come out at the same time as the hardback.  I don't believe this delay was Mr. Sanderson's choice, but rather at the insistence of Robert Jordan's widow.  Shame.
B009FHRRAA|5.0|Greatest rock band that make you think and performs great music. They have influence many other bands but they are the best.

B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an amazing violinist, and I hope she keeps creating music.  Her artistic composure of each of the songs on this album is simply fantastic, and is well balanced with the electric, and dub-step beats that she uses to back her up.  A must own!
1476715904|5.0|HUGE 5 STARS!<br /><br />\\"Don't take life too seriously. Punch it in the face when it needs a good hit. Laugh at it.\\"<br /><br />I read this book a long time ago, and I wrote a little review, but there was a lot of emotions I couldn't put into words until now, when I sat down and made myself write them :)<br /><br /> Until this book, I had never heard of slam poetry. Regular poetry? sure, I read it from time to time, but this slam poetry? WOW it blew my mind into a million pieces! the poetry was amazing and heartfelt, I cried and laughed at the different characters' poetry.<br /><br />\\"Never judge others. You both know good and well how unexpected events can change who a person is. Always keep that in mind. You never know what someone else is experiencing within their own life.\\"<br /><br />The first book I read from Colleen was Hopeless, it left me with such a big impact, that I had to immediately check out her other books and get them ASAP, and sure enough they didn't disappoint, this book taught me so many things about: grieving, forgiveness, second chances, love, responsibilities, hard choices, heartbreak, and last of all but the best HOPE. What Will and Lake go through in this book with losing parents, and growing up too quickly to be there for their families, it breaks your heart, how could it not?<br /><br />\\"I got schooled this year<br />by<br />a<br />boy.<br /><br />A boy that I'm seriously, deeply, madly, incredibly, and undeniably inlove with.<br />And he taught me the most important thing of all...<br /><br />To put the emphasis<br />On life .\\"<br /><br />Colleen has created characters that you instantly connect and relate to, and she makes you believe in their struggle, in the feelings and the best of all? she makes you feel like your right there going through it all with them, yeah there are times where you get frustrated and think \\"What? no! don't do that, get back together now!\\" but that is just a testament on how emotional invested you are in the book, for me? anytime an author make me feel like that in a book, proves they have done a bloody brilliant job, it is a great achievement when an reader feels like they're part of the story and its characters.<br /><br />A well deserved clap on the shoulder Colleen!<br />This book is incredible, everything about it from the story, to the characters was amazing the poetry and lyrics? just icing on the top.<br /><br />I definetely recommend this to all who wants to read a really great book, A MUST READ.<br />5 star, well done Colleen,a really great job!ok, for me? anytime an author make me feel like that in a book, proves they have done a bloody brilliant job, it is a great achievement when an reader feels like they're part of the story and its characters.<br /><br />A well deserved clap on the shoulder Colleen!<br />This book is incredible, everything about it from the story, to the characters was amazing the poetry and lyrics? just icing on the top.<br /><br />I definetely recommend this to all who wants to read a really great book, A MUST READ.<br />5 star, well done Colleen,a really great job!

B003L77GRY|4.0|If you start watching Dexter on DVD you will just have to see all of them.  I am working my way up to Season 7.  This season I liked but the newer ones are even better.
0765325950|5.0|An excellent final chapter to this saga. However it does leave room for further books in the series and we most likely can expect them in the coming years. Doubtful though, they will be able to trump the scale of this massive, 900 pages long battle scene.<br /><br />A grand finale that the fans of the series waited for.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think the book is pretty good. Not the best but definitely good enough for me to buy the second book.
0143119680|4.0|It was a little slow going at first but really got into it after the 6 th chapter can't wait to start book 2
B009JBZH54|4.0|Couldn't wait to get this to watch in the privacy of my own home theatre! Just wish it had the dvd versions included so I could put them on my hard drive/media server. I thought Violet would allow me to download the digital version but it only streams it - tried to set up an account but maybe my connection is too slooowww - after three tries at 5' ea, I said screw it - just stick with the discs. The included booklet is pretty cool, but so what- wish the cover design was better (some frank miller art maybe?). Well I'm going to watch it again in a few minutes. I know there are critics out there who point out some gaps in the story line with incredulity. I read comics and I read the news.  Gaps in the story line of real life or imagination land are not rare. The movies are bl@p#$n awesome!!!
0425263916|5.0|GREAT BOOK,GREAT AUTHOR, CAN'T WAIT FOR THE THIRD BOOK TO COME OUT IN MAY. LOVE THEM. AS GOOD AS FIFTY SHADES OF GREY
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I love cute movies! I was very touched and surprised about how tear-jerking it is. As a big sister I cant wait to share this with my little sister. Defiantly worth the money.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|Interesting way to include player in the story. The different types of games require some logical thinking although repetition of same game can be annoying. Still like this game enough to get the next Azada game.
0765325950|1.0|In a misguided attempt to ensure AMoL reaches #1 on the hardcover book list Tor have alienated a large and loyal following by following the advice of Jordan's widow, despite the best efforts of Sanderson to have the ebook released as soon as possible.<br /><br />This has resulted in the final book of Wheel of Time being a hugely negative experience.
178022219X|4.0|Defending Jacob was our book club's November selection.  It's a thought provoking novel and with the recent tragedy at Sandy Hook, makes it a very current topic.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Such a heartwarming,  hopeful and inspiring example of great humanity! A wonderful model for humble self expression in the arts.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great read. I would only expect to read for a half hour to an hour at a time, but once I started reading I didn't want to stop. The book keeps you guessing the whole time.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Works great in my camera. I couldn't find it in any stores in my home town. Being able to get the new card saved me the costs of buying a new camera.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|The new birds and their different powers are just he reboot this game needed.  Light sabers, force powers and blasters are just a few of the surprises you'll discover
B00992CF6W|3.0|Hey everyone. For those used to the Xbox version, this is nothing like it, hence pocket edition. It is difficult manoever around and it frequently freezes or glitches and there are not as many building materials available.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 8 year old LOVES this game and is fanastic at it.  He creates machines that we grown ups cannot eve conceive.
1476719071|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! The story line and the writing style of the author!  I couldn't put it down!  A love hate relationship between Abby and Travis.  But, it is done so beautifully.  I am purchasing the second book!

0061251321|5.0|This book made me look at myself and the world around me (at my company) in a different light. I have not only grown as a business leader because of it, but as a person as well. This is more psychology than it is strict business principles and if you are open to it can help you to change your business and your life.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|the application is not very clear and the Kindle Fire HD camera is only one sided and that is not a good design I am NOT pleased with this feature a'll.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Usually don't like this type of book but fell in love and fully engaged from the beginning. Must read for all ages.
B0058W74UY|2.0|didn't revolve my issue to play like e stream on my church website, will keep looking to find out what I need to get it to work.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Simply put, this was by far the best fantasy novel I read in 2012. It is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. Anthony Ryan's work is comparable to Rothfuss', Sanderson's or Abercombie's. It is enjoyable from beginning to end on the first read through or subsequent ones. I cannot recommend this book enough, particularly if you enjoy a warrior-type protagonist as I am wont to.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I GIVE DIS SHOW 5 STARS CAUSE ITS THE BEST SHOW EVER!!!!! I WOULD RECOMMEND DIS SHOW TO EVERYONE I KNOW......
B009VB97EY|4.0|Within the first 10 minutes of this movie, I decided I wanted to buy it. Hotness!!!!! Totally a chick flick and do NOT watch it with kids around! I didn't realize there would be so much sex in this movie and watched it with my 14 year old little sister cuz she's all about Channing Tatum, OOPS! Too many times I had to cover her eyes with the couch pillows haha! But very hot, ok story line, things I didn't expect. All in all, I'll watch it again for sure!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This product arrived ahead of schedule, and was in pristine condition. We love this movie and is one of the best family oriented Christmas movies yet! So happy we made this purchase.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|It isn't an over exaggeration to call Food, Inc. one of the most powerful and timely documentaries ever filmed. What is more important to life than health, and what more important factor is there to health than the food that we put into our bodies? This documentary examines what has become of the streamlined food industry that has resulted in a very small number of companies and distributors controlling the majority of the food eaten by consumers. In fact, Food, Inc. blisteringly exposes the fact that what looks like variety on the shelves of supermarkets is just an illusion for the consumer.<br /><br />One of the more incredible takeaways from the film is the explanation of how much weight the purchasing power of a company like McDonald's holds. If McDonald's is the number one purchaser of beef and potatoes in the nation, and they want something changed in farming, fertilizing or the feeding of cows, what do you think is going to happen? At the end of the day, you might not be eating McDonald's fries, but chances are you're eating potatoes cultivated according to McDonald's specifications. Another problematic take-away is the understanding that the skewed nature of our agricultural system (both in business and politics) makes it much harder for impoverished individuals to eat healthy instead of resorting to the dollar menu.<br /><br />Food, Inc. covers the entire spectrum of agriculture, including the aforementioned streamlining of the food industry, the ill-advised use of corn to feed cows that weren't meant to digest such food, the confrontational business tactics of GMO companies like Monsanto, and all of the consequences to our health - both physical and economic. As an alternative, Food, Inc. looks into the organic food industry and the more sustainable farming practices of those involved, such as Polyface Farm in Virginia. Despite all the current issues with our agricultural industries, informed consumers are starting to make decisions about their eating habits that are forcing companies such as Walmart to start carrying more and more organic foods. Food, Inc. encourages us to stay informed, and tells us that we have a choice in this matter by voting three times a day with the decision of which foods to eat: Buy organic; Buy local.

0988262592|5.0|I had the pleasure of meeting Gene Kim in October of 2011 at the Security B-Sides conference in Portland, OR. He had just presented on the concept for his novel, and I was immediately intrigued. It seemed like he intended to bring the concept of the business parable to IT management. I joked it looked like a [[ASIN:B000M65KDO Who Moved My Cheese?]] for the ITIL crowd.<br /><br />In speaking with Gene following his presentation, I thanked him in person for [[ASIN:0975568612 The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps]] (which I maintain is still the best $20 I ever spent). Through our conversation, he flagged me as the type of \\"boundary spanner\\" who would benefit from a more thorough reading of his new effort, and he nailed that assessment. I didn't want to put it down. [[ASIN:0988262592 The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win]] reads like a techo-thriller. I found it very engaging and definitely wanted to read the whole thing all in one sprint. I hadn't found myself that thoroughly engrossed in a read in quite some time.<br /><br />The cast is spot-on. Each is clearly meant to represent a specific organizational perspective or archetype. If you aren't one of these characters, you at least know someone who is. A few may seem a little exaggerated or caricatured, but that is more from a sense of literary license and less in any manner to offend. The roles are readily identifiable and it is easy to see oneself as any member of the cast. If this causes the reader any discomfort, one should perhaps take the hint.<br /><br />As I joined Bill Palmer, the story's main protagonist, on his odyssey as he deals with \\"late projects, chronic outages, massive audit findings and the imminent threat of outsourcing\\" and - having lived that adventure myself - I thought, \\"Been there. Done that.\\" It is well known that projects, and corresponding confidence in IT, fail in predictable and repeatable ways. So, it is both disheartening and reassuring to see us doing things so perfectly wrong. Even more important is the illumination of a clear path out of that death spiral of angst and despair.<br /><br />Also of considerable use is the extensive bibliography of business literature from which Gene & co. have drawn. The reader is introduced to key concepts, from the Theory of Constraints outlined in Eli Goldratt's parable, [[ASIN:0884270610 The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement]], to the agile management techniques of David J. Anderson's [[ASIN:B0057H2M70 Kanban]] and the leadership and team-building dynamics found in Patrick Lencioni's [[ASIN:0787960756 The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable]] without being hit over the head. The story informs, educates and provides a jumping-off point for those seeking additional knowledge in the fields of Lean IT and Agile Management.<br /><br />I believe [[ASIN:0988262592 The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win]] is already sold to my colleagues working in or managing IT operations. It will also be of interest to those IT professionals who are inclined to think outside of their silos and concern themselves with bigger picture issues relevant to the entire business. I see this becoming mandatory reading for executive staff and other enterprise stakeholders being enabled or constrained by their own IT processes. I will certainly attempt to influence that outcome in my own organization.

B0019HQIGS|5.0|awesome concert  John Mayer is a master on the guitar and I've been a big fan ever since the beginning.
B009E3EY38|5.0|FANTASTIC! Plant sounds like he did 40 years ago, Page shows why he is the best rock and roll guitarist of all time and Jones is a virtuoso on bass and keyboards.  This is the best recorded concert they have ever done!  Not a bunch of show, just doing their music.  Yeah the editing will make you twitch every so often, but it's ALL about the music.  Better buy the collection because I doubt if it will be televised soon if ever.  5 is not enough stars to rate this masterpiece!
B002BI6SMI|1.0|....but the movie was dreadful. Neeson was the only good thing about it, but he couldn't save it.  Amazed to see there's a sequel.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Piano Guys from their youtube channel ever since I first saw Cello Wars and started to listen to their other works. Now, I like a lot of different kinds of music and this cd features songs taken from many different genres. If you have more particular tastes in your music then you might want to look over the song list and listen to the Piano Guys version on youtube before you commit to buying a full album. For example, if you don't like classical instrumental music then you might want to think carefully before you lay down the money for this. If you are unfamiliar with the Piano Guys think of something in the same vein as the Trans-Siberian Orchestra or the Manheim Steamrollers all of which are adept at taken well-known songs and putting a new, unique, catchy, and modern spin on it to make it more appealing. Most of all, especially if you watch the youtube videos, you can tell they genuinely have fun as they play.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What can i not say about these books.... besides im left hanging after the 2nd one...... cant wait to finish with the 3rd!!
B007RXRSEY|3.0|Overall this album isn't bad. Like with most albums you have some songs that are hits which catch your attention and tempt you to replay it over and over and then there are other songs which are more lackluster and find you hitting the skip button. For the price, 5 dollars, it is a good buy but I am not sure if the price I got was a temporary sale to promote the new release or if it will be the standard.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|Bought this movie for my son who is a huge fan of the HALO video games and toys. He liked it!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The movie is great, just as advertised thre package arived quickly and in good condition.<br />I haven't tried the ultraviolet feature yet.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This series was amazing, could not put it down once I got started. The author kept my interest during the entire series and that was a great deal of reading.  Each character in the series was presented as very unique and moved throughout the series with new pieces of their lives exposed throughout.  I hope there is a sequel or maybe I will just let my imagination take to the rest!!!

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Bought this for my brother-in-law as a Christmas present. He has really enjoyed them and the vvideo quality is great. This is a must buy for any Community fan.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Everything I expected it to be. Great product! Great Service and delivery.. Bought this for my son for Christmas along with the Kindle Fire...He has read more books than he has in his life and is really lost on the show LOST... The stand makes viewing so easy!
0765325950|1.0|It seems that delaying the e-publishing \\"was the widow's decision based off of the author's wish. In wanting to make sure her deceased husband's book found its place on the best seller list regardless of the poor way those lists handle e-books, she made the unpopular decision in order to safeguard his legacy\\".<br /><br />I discovered this series on e-book. I've read each book twice. I was really excited to read the final book. I wonder what legacy the widow ensured when she designated e-readers as second class citizens? Would there have been any 1 reviews?<br /><br />For me, I am reading the reviews and other online sources to find out what happens. If I get enough information, I won't have to read the book at all. There are so many wonderful authors who do not discriminate against e-readers that I'd rather support them (as long as my curiosity about what happens is satisfied).
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Good action and strong bad guy!  Could have used a little more support to the different characters though...I would watch it again!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Arrived quickly and in good condition.  I enjoyed this CD, it was jazzy and reminded me of music in the late 50's.  And, of course, Rod puts his own spin on the classics.
1558908846|5.0|My boyfriend is a huge fan of this movie, I believe I bought a used copy and it did not disappoint!
B00633W614|4.0|The Clifton Chronicles is typical Archer.  All Archer books are worth the read.  Can't wait for the last of this trilogy.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book keeps you guessing till the end. It is romantically up and down. I can't wait to read the next one. If u love a good book read this book.
B008DVJO8C|4.0|This was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves this band. However he was not that impressed with the entire cd. I think he was looking for something a little less pop-ish and more heavy. I am not a fan of the screaming music if thats what you want to call it and he assured me it would be something I would like because it isn' t that hardcore.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoy this drama thoroughly nice change of pace. Great perspective. Looking forward to reading the book and cookbook. Interesting facets of daily life.
B003L20IJM|1.0|GOT THE DVD IN GOOD TIME, BUT IT RAN ABOUT 15 MINUTES, THEN STOPPED AND THEN STARTED AGAIN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE.  I SENT IT BACK, BUT SENT IT TO THE WRONG COMPANY, THEREFORE, BY MY OWN FAULT, I AM OUT THE MONEY OF THIS CD.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|His album was good, and quite surprising. He mixes it up, and it seems different from some of his Idol stuff. Highly recommend it!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is my first Kindle book. and I love it, read the first one and this one is even better.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This is a good movie, but my expectations were HIGH after watching the trilogy starring Mar Damon. I recommend it.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This is an amazing box of my favorite things!!!  The Discs with special features give such great insight to understand the story of the Sound of Music even better!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  I am hooked now on Lee Child's Jack Reacher series.  Fast moving, fun to read.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I have been using Documents to go for many years and I love it, if you need and app that's compatiable with any version of MS Office then this app is for you.  It does not replace Office its just a simple tool.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I have fallen in love with this group's music, so I love the CD.  It arrived quickly and in perfect shape
B008CPZNL6|3.0|Decent app - doesn't quite do Facebook correctly  (but then, Facebook doesn't really do it right anymore either!).  Great for my google reader (RSS) feeds since it marks things as read and away they go.  Wish it would function in landscape.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I bought this as a small Christmas gift for my wife, who has been listening to Lindsey's music on YouTube for awhile now.  She loves this CD, it's on constant rotation in her car right now.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Makes shopping even easier (maybe that's not a good thing!).  Easy to use.  Wish it was comparable with my nexus 10. Weird.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was such a great  book I'm so happy I started this series I just loved it so much :)
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This is alot of fun, what is great about it, you can play it with one hand, and some great tunes.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was awesome loved it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wish there were more books to read!! After Rockingham I mean. Loved it and always will.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|My husband and I agree that this is one of the few movies that can be watched over and over again and still love every time! It also has a great soundtrack!
6304983778|5.0|I watched this movie as a child and wanted my son to have it to watch also. We both love it!
0060763280|5.0|I chose this rating because it opens your mind to what is required to be successful, not just financial success, but success at whatever one is striving for.<br />I recommend this book to anyone that is committed to financial success.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|Trouble with the curve.<br />It was not as good as I thought it would be. The story was to predictable.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As a long-time fan, I began to wonder how the Navy & Marines are surviving all the murders in the DC area but this season has some new excitement running through it.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Definitely a great read.  Nothing corny or ridiculous, but then say the story is told through individual accounts gives a really authentic feel for the story.  I like how it explains how it would be possible for people to let it get to that point and the only way a truly global zombie catastrophe could be dealt with.  Highly recommended!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I never thought I would like a story about 1920's England but I find myself captivated and entralled with the characters and storylines.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Very funny exciting and plain awsome it was a very good book probably my 3rd favorite wish there was a number 2
B005HSL626|5.0|We love fruit ninja it is so fun and entertaining, my 9 yr old son loves it and always tries to beat his last score
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this read !! Great ups and downs throughout. This was the first I downloaded on my kindle and it was free! Awesome.
B009VB97EY|3.0|It has a sweet love story and some hot guys. But other than that it was totally stupid. I wouldn't say its a &#34;must see&#34;.
B005HJU7HA|4.0|Excellent for the price.  It is really a complete edition. A few typos here and there are the only irritating things.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I found a Bible reading plan that I love to get me through the entire Bible in a year. I like having access to different versions to help in Bible study.
B009MF56GC|5.0|The movie is great entertaining but the extras of this DVD are amazing: deleted scenes, featurettes, gag reel, and even a real documentary on real &#34;expendables&#34; (private military contractors), even a take on the real guns used on the movies. The Djokovic scene is here. I think it's a great Blu-Ray and if you liked the movie, you should get this one.
B008602KQI|5.0|Before seeing it theaters, I hadn't read the books or had any real expectations of greatness; I was pleasantly surprised by I saw. Now I've read the trilogy, and just re-watched the movie. The movie does a great job of following the first book, and I was overall happy with the few changes that were made. I would recommend this film for those who have read the book, as well as for those who haven't. Obviously, there is violence, so I wouldn't recommend showing this to young children. The story is great, the movie is well-done, and I'm really excited for the next to movies to come out!
B005ZOLW4Y|5.0|I'm an avid fan of the rock star and own every album. I saw this purchase on my recommendations list and decided, especially given the price, that this is a must have! The live tracks are great, mixed very well. The album itself is wonderful, including his major hit &#34;piano man&#34;.<br /><br />If you are a fan, there's no question...add it to your cart!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Like a few other reader apps out there, the Kindle app is good. I have Amazon Prime and this app but they won't count that for the lending library. :(
1594487154|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is interested in learning how to be more persuasive.  Buy it if you want to be more influential and successful.<br /><br />The longer version:<br /><br />One of the first ideas I try to impress upon people when I teach presentation skills and public speaking is that we're all presenters. You don't have to speak to packed ballrooms or create huge decks of PowerPoint slides to be in the presentation business. If you're not a hermit or a shut-in chances are you give several presentations every day, even if you are just demonstrating that you're competent at your job, getting your kids to eat their dinner, or earning a free upgrade when you check in at your hotel. Every interaction should be thought of as a presentation because each one should be persuasive. Otherwise you're wasting an opportunity.<br /><br />In To Sell is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others, Daniel Pink approaches the same idea from a different angle. Not only are we all presenters but \\"we're all in sales now.\\" Technological changes and the rise of entrepreneurship have required each of us to be more involved in persuading, influencing, and \\"moving\\" others. But Pink doesn't mean that we should start behaving like the stereotypical used-car salesmen so many of us loathe and fear. To the contrary, those smarmy techniques don't really work anymore.<br /><br />Using engaging anecdotes and scientific studies, Pink shows us the kinds of strategies and specific tactics that DO work when you need to be persuasive. Things like understanding the perspective of the people you want to persuade, being flexible in making your pitch, and working to honestly meet the needs of your \\"clients\\". He even provides sample cases at the end of each chapter to show exactly how you can apply these ideas.<br /><br />I look at a lot of these kinds of books, and this is really one of the best. It's a good read and provides advice that you can start using right away. I've said it before, but buy this book if you're interested in being more influential and more successful.e, but buy this book if you're interested in being more influential and more successful.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Always my favorite show and three lightening deal at Christmas was just fantastic. Fat and cheap for a favorite? Sweet!
1935251740|5.0|Robert Lanza writes with the right combination of scholarly scientific acumen and down to earth explanation about the deepest mysteries of reality..
B000JWTX3Y|4.0|cute movie. mild innuendo, but good acting and fun storyline. Funny, interesting and entertaining. Lindsay is one of my favorites!
B0091REZMW|5.0|it is a great mysterious game with many twist and turns! you will love it if you a mystery solver! no doubt about it
B007FJFDXS|5.0|great graphics, responsiveness and game play. challenging but fun. i love playing this and would definitely recommend it to a friend.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I stumbled across these talented guys (one plays the piano, the other the cello) on YouTube.  Their videos are awesome. Take the cover of this CD, for instance.  It is a picture taken on the top of a huge huge bolder where they used a helicopter to get the piano up there.  They either have a funny, intense, inspirational, or just 'good listening' song, with concert sound. I hope they make another CD sometime this year!  They have a passion for what they do, making music!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|love the book. great to read after the son of neptune. It's informative and somewhat challenging, yet still just plain fun to read. good job, Rick!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|The points that are discussed in this book have changed my life. The author takes you through not just what you can do to change your own level of happiness, but talks about the studies that back up his point and his own personal experiences. This is an amazing book.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|A good watch. Would recommend to one and all. Especially good for longtime Sherlock Holmes fans who always wished someone would make a film deserving of the World's Greatest Detective.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This one is great for the holidays!!!!  You will be laughing all the way through this movie!  Makes you think about your own family craziness during the holidays.  I would recommend this one to all!
B000HEWEEE|5.0|this movie is great it was very cheap and awesome quality i would definatlyy recommend the movie and the seller to all my friends
B003XDZN7G|5.0|I found these for a great price!  And they are great for my job, I needed something close toed that can get wet without getting ruined.
B004BSFC46|1.0|Don't bother with these.  I thought they'd be great for my grandson since he was dropping everthing you put in his hands, but you can't even hear the rattle and neither did he.  Was a waste of money.
B000069KE0|5.0|BEST ALBUM THEY MADE.  TERRY KATH WAS EXTRAORDINARY AND THE BRASS WAS USED A LOT TO GREAT EFFECT.  LOVE THIS ALBUM.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|i'M NOT A PET PERSON, BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BOOK. GLAD I FINISHED IT BEFORE I LOST MY KINDLE
0345803485|1.0|Probably one of the hardest books to finish.  But, too each its own opinion.  Maybe I missed something or missed a charter or two.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!! Colleen Hoover does it again. This book is amazing from beginning to end. I love Holder and Sky. It was perfection.
B005R32L66|5.0|Awesome sound, pics,  clear sound,  pics, very handy on holidays or any day use. Buisness, and personal use. I would recomend it to other people.
0307593312|4.0|This book is definitely unlike any other that I have read and its characters and plot are sure to stay with me for a while. First work I've read by Murakami, amazing. Sure, the book was long and it started off a little slow, but wow, what a journey. A must read.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|I thoght this movie was very funny. its good for kids and adults alike. Will Ferrell is funny like usual
0618680004|5.0|This should be a mandatory item for all bookshelves.  Atheists should own this as a basic answer to the question from friends &#34;Why are you an atheist?&#34;, it will give them as simple an avenue of answer as theists when they hand someone their religious book.  Not only does this displace the old axioms or religion, but gives multiple reasons and ideas behind each world view.  This is a great book, that is one of the best works of the 21st Century, and should be heralded as such (as it most likely will be) for many years to come.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|good read - I love John Grisham his books are always a fast and easy read this one<br />was not his best but still pretty good
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another thriller from Tom Clancy!  Jack Ryan keeps you in suspense throughout the entire book!  The Clancy style has always been one of the best in the field of war stories!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wish I could have given more than 5 stars!!! This book left me with only 2 hrs sleep before my next day began because I just could not stop reading it.  I was completely hooked. This author took an extremely delicate subject matter and handled it with much needed grace.  I have read this book twice so far and will definitely read it again at a later date.  I was able to put myself in the character's shoes to laugh, cry and feel the love and pain.  I can not say enough good things about this book!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I absolutely LOVED the movie. I laughed, I cringed, I cried. And I had the same reactions to the songs on the soundtrack. However...because this is just highlights of the movie music, there's a lot of stuff missing. It's a good summary, but I would've rather had all the songs. And, the biggest problem of all is that they've cut \\"Do You Hear The People Sing\\" from this CD!! There's the different, shortened version of it at the very end of the epilogue, but I wanted to hear the Barricade Boy's cast version, the one with such emotion and power. I'm disappointed that it's not on this cd.<br /><br />But all in all, it's pretty good. I adore Jackman and Hathaway's voices, along with the other supporting cast members. I wasn't crazy about Crowe's at first, but it grows on you. Les Miserables is a beautiful piece of work, both cinematically and musically. This soundtrack celebrates some of the best of the best. I just wish there was more.
B007SGM084|5.0|A friend let me borrow the 1st book and I was reluctant about reading it, but once I started, I couldn't put it down.  The 1st book was not my favorite, but as the characters grew, I fell in love with them. By the end of the 1st one, I couldn't wait to read the 2nd and so on.  This book is graphic in some areas, but not so much so that I felt uncomfortable.  The 2nd and 3rd books are not focused so much on the characters sex lives and the story line really progresses. These books are so much more than sex and bondage. You get to know the characters, laugh, love and cry with them.  The series was filled with action, suspense, fun, thrill and drama.  I have read the series twice so far and will definitely read it again soon.  This book made me think about my marriage and want to be a better wife to my hard working husband.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I bought the entire season one and had no issues. So, Amazon was my first choice when I missed the original airing of this episode.
B0015DROBO|3.0|interesting story line. The violence was too rough for my taste that part was very distasteful surprise ending was not anticipated
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I first saw this movie over the summer and have been introducing it to all my grandkids. They love it too.
0765325950|3.0|A Memory of Light is a quick read.  Yes, that's right, 800+ pages of a quick read.  It will grab fans and race along with them as they read, barely stopping for a breath, leaving everyone thrilled and worn out at the end.  Then some time will pass and you will ultimately feel betrayed by the book.<br /><br />That break neck pace, 800 plus pages of pretty much nothing but the Last Battle, counter almost everything that has made The Wheel of Time so great.  Characters became cartoons of the way they were developing.  Story arcs that were brought through hundreds of pages and complex development are solved in a couple of paragraphs.  Those arcs are nothing compared to the ones that are completely dropped and not explained at all.  Not small and inconsequential stories, these are points that were stressed again and again throughout, with the threads of closure laid out there for us all, just never tied together by Sanderson.  All of it feels totally unbalanced to the rest of the series, where a careful and deliberate pace is used until incredible climaxes that brought forth real emotion.  I wish that the story could have flipped these absent and quick solutions with some true development, while cutting down on the length and detail around the Last Battle.<br /><br />I won't even go into some of the blatant, in your face commentaries that are aimed directly at the online community discussions.  They are simply a slap in the face to all fans.<br /><br />The book will thrill upon first reading and then come off as cheap and lacking that trademark emotion from the rest of the series.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|If you own a home ...this is the movie to see. If you are thinking of owning a home...watch before you buy.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|Recommended by Joel Spolsky so I picked it up and it's a great example of how minds with Asperger's Syndrome think. Highly recommended. Although from a story point of view the last half was a little disengaging.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|What can i say... it's the Avengers and I have a 6 year old boy. Of course we loved it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow, this book was great!  I couldn't put it down. I think it is definitely one of his best yet!
B009GIPDQS|2.0|I'm a Grisham fan and always look for his most recent book. But The Racketeer was a real disappointment: an overly complex plot that tests the reader's credulity to and beyond the limit. I'll still buy his next book, but this was a rare exception to Grisham's 'can't put it down' storytelling.
B008IGP8QE|5.0|Bought this for our 6 year old Granddaughter for Christmas.  She loves it and sings along with all the songs.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Really, really love this!!!  Many, many of Elton John's great hits.  I am so sorry I didn't buy it sooner.
B001MSMULG|5.0|Silva is an excellent writer, with a style I find easy to read.  His plots are relatively easy to follow, although one must pay attention for clues that are dropped along the way, but not explained or expanded upon until much later..I especially like the Gabriel Allon character.
B009157BWU|5.0|I had been wanting to see this for some time. I found it to be interesting and wonderfully done. Oscar is just adorable and it is so amazing they were able to get all this footage. Tim Allen was a great narrator too.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|but then it took off like a shot.  One of the best car chase scenes I've seen in the movies, and the end is superbly balanced.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child has another winner!  This is a typical Jack Reacher novel, full of suspense, unassuming heroics, and exactly what I want in a good read.
B002CPMB9O|3.0|Denzel Washington isn't believable as a villain for the first hour or so...he eventually grows into the role.  The problem is that Frank Lucas is an &#34;ethical&#34; mobster who provides top-class product and goes to church, and Richie (Russell Crowe's character) is a &#34;nasty&#34; good guy who womanizes, and neither are really successful in creating that ambivalence in each case.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I lost my daughter three years ago. My sorrow has been for her sad life as a sufferer of mental illness.  She had multiple myeloma and.suffered so much.  To have her gone from me is so painful.  Especially when I remember her last day here with us.  She was in a nursing home and was rushed to the hospital.  When I came in she said \\" Thank you for coming\\"'  To this day it tears at my soul.  We knew this was the end and she died without gaining consciousness. I believe Mr. Alexander and now I rejoice to think she is with God.  I will see her and my loved ones. \\"Now we look through a glass darkly\\"............  Yesterday in church, everything made so much more to me.  Read this book.
030746363X|5.0|4HB was an easy read and truly motivated me to try new ways to get more healthy and fit than ever before! I consistently look back at all of my highlights for motivation and new things to try!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Very good... Not the easiest read but a fantastic story.  Better not read while focus is on studies no way you can read and want to study!! This will get you thinking
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not stop reading this book until I finished it. Each chapter was a cliff hanger that begged you to read the next. The characters are riveting. I immediately bought the next book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love a book that keeps you guessing. Almost done reading it and can't wait to see how it ends.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I felt as though this book did not have as much of a plot line as I would have liked. It was kind of all over the place and seemed to lack a definite point. I would recommend this book to teens who are working on &#34;finding themselves,&#34; but I would highly discourage them from paying particular attention to the drug references. I disliked how Charlie came to rely on drugs and smoking, even becoming reliant on cigarettes. Other than that, I thought this book deserved an &#34;ok&#34; rating overall, because it was decent but not exceptional.
B001OG3VOQ|3.0|Still a good cd. Good memories. I just remember it being ROCK. I think the whole studio musician deal is the problem. If it were re-recorded with her band that toured with her following this cd it would've been amazing. I mean, really, just having Taylor Hawkins drumming. Done.
B001JRB16U|5.0|We hope that this is the last time we have to purchase &#34;Mary Poppins&#34; since our kids have destroyed a few copies already. It is great family entertainment, and we were glad to be able to purchase it at a reasonable price.
B004VN5MNC|4.0|Wow. All the talk about how heavy this album was going to be after all the others... a little dissappointing. But Mr. Grohl, you are forgiven. For all the years of excellence. &#34;One of these days&#34;, they'll find another classic Foo song to put back on repeat on radio and give my ears a break from that one. At least play &#34;rope&#34; more. I Should've Known is great.<br />If your reading this, and haven't bought this cd yet, do it. While your at it, get &#34;Back and Fourth&#34; dvd/blu ray, you'll appreciate the Foo's more than you ever have.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|Got it for my 2 kids who love Lego's and Star Wars. Not easy to build, takes time but worth it at the end. Has become some kind of art masterpiece for people who come over. Kids Love it! Thanks.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|The acting is great! Storyline is well crafted. I just wish Andy Whitfield was still here. Hopefully his family still gets a cut of the procedes. In my opinion they should out of all of the &#34;Spartacus&#34; seasons.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|yea this game is very addictive.  I'm on level something so I'm doing pretty good so over all this game is very good
B003UMW68O|5.0|We've watched this quite a few times. The combo is great, so when he wants to watch it, he has the DVD for his room. Disney Classic.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am still reading this end to the trilogy, loving what I have read so far.  This is a great set of romance novels.
B0090CMMIC|4.0|Needed to be mixed better. The guitars are muddy, I guess maybe i just listen too intently. But its a little distracting. Great vocals, and melodies. Just buy it.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|The size is perfect and could ask for nothing less. Hope all who buy this enjoy the snot of out it.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|It seems like i've seen this before. I guess a lot of what was going to happen, my wife was baffled. haha. But as always the acting is awesome. These two could pull off any role, perfectly. I bought this on n***er tuesday, and the ultraviolet code already expired. Stoopid. Why have an expiration date in the first place? its not that old of a movie. Thats the main reason i took off a star.
0385340559|5.0|This just might be my favorite reacher novel; he's back in the saddle with the special investigators, and someone is gonna get the mojo put on them.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I can't wait till &quot;Slender Man! Chapter 2&quot; this is the most terrifying game on the Kindle. It is so amazing I suggest trying hard w/ fog on! they fixed the whole turning problem. Its a MUST buy if you like slender man games!!! please please please make a Chapter 2!!!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Seems like Clint plays pretty much the same character in every movie these days, but it was an enjoyable movie with a good mix of humor and drama.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Good movie for Family movie night. Some good laughs and a sweet story. Steve Carrel and Jason Segal voice the main characters and are both funny.
B008MM9630|5.0|this is the cutest app ever and its relaxing to play too<br />this is the cutest app ever and fun to play
034544678X|4.0|The Other End of the Lead<br />This book offers a different approach to dog training.  It is not a how to book but one that helps you understand why your dog reacts to what you do.  It is a very sensible approach and is good to read before going forward with training.  It helps you understand why what you are doing isn't working. My vet recommended it to me to help with some temperment issues. Wish I had it a year ago.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was fun and light hearted, I had a smile on my face much of the book.  Typical romance in many ways.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|If you want to laugh at something dumb... this is the movie for you.  Nothing serious about a teddy bear who comes to life and makes his owners life troublesome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK. I felt everything Hope felt through the book. Absolutely worth reading.  Great storyline that kept me on the edge of my seat.
B008NEVP1S|5.0|A great album of pop inspired tunes from Ms. Mann.  Once again, she does not disapoint.  Only the last song seems oddly out of place.  Not to be missed!
B00884GR0W|2.0|Can't play. Closes and freezes phone every time I try to play it! I have a Droid razr by Motorola
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Keeps it protected well as well as works as a stand for the device. Very well done. Needs more color options though.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is fantastic. It doesn't tell you about Alzheimer's, it takes you on a journey into it.  Brilliant!  Scary!  Eye opening! You find yourself becoming Alice.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really enjoyed this second book in the sequel.  It hooked me from the very beginning and held my interest until the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book, I couldn't put it down at all<br /><br />I would read it again and again<br />Thanks
B003UN409Q|5.0|Very interesting and didnt have any problems with the movie! It was a simple download and I had enough time to watch it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. It was cute and kept my attention throughout. I would definitely read more by this author!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Believable account of living and reliving a childhood trauma. Really enjoyed how characters were so carefully crafted and developed. You can actually feel the story working for the reader. Loved it.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have a large collection of cartoons. I have a lot of small neices and nephews that visit often. Anything that can keep them quiet for awhile is well worth the money.
B00628SJJS|5.0|This movie has it's own way of telling a moral through the innocent eyes of 8 year old Bruno, who is naïve and oblivious to the horrible situation of WWII and the holocaust. He soon finds out that the world he thought he knew is nothing of the sort. He realizes that his father's job as a Nazi is not something to proudly show off to his friends, as he is exposed to the trauma in the concentration camps shortly after meeting Shmuel, a boy of 8 who he befriends. I very much enjoyed watching this HD movie on my kindle fire. The movie was displayed very clearly and the graphics and audio was exceptional.

B003V5CFV8|5.0|An absolute gem from the Coen brothers, and that's saying a lot about the team that created Fargo, Raising Arizona, A Serious Man, and The Big Lebowski.
B005ILYW1E|4.0|gritty & good. Some talented people make a nifty little thriller. Surprised me on a Saturday night. Had not heard about this. IMDB'd it saw the original author and stayed. Very glad I did. A good one.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This thriller flies by fast. it is packed with action and surprises. Far fetched, but that makes its charm.. Hard to put down.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|My 4 year old son and I both love this movie. I would watch this by myself. It's one of those movies that's for kids, but has subtleties in it that adults will find enjoyable. Definitely one of my favorite movies to watch as a family.
B007V65R54|4.0|If you already know Bayes and prediction in depth, this book won't help. But if you want a brief primer, buy it.<br /><br />He does not by the way share much about the 2012 election, look elsewhere for that discussion.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Omg This movie is freaking amazing all the super heroes  coming together have a great chemistry together the storyline is great , the action is perfect .the comedy is just right. this movie hit all your senses perfect
B007ZXK08C|4.0|From the moment go we are intrigued by the relationship between the &#34;ideal&#34; couple, Ken and Barbie. No, they are not really called that ... But may very well have been, so perfect and lacking in standout features they seem to be. At first. But, then the wife disappears, and it becomes slowly but chillingly clear: things are not so cool in the world of Nick and Amy Dunne.<br />I read this on my iPad, but had it been pages, I think they would have been set alight by the sheer force of this edgy thriller. Not a dull moment anywhere, and just when you think you've figured it out, Gillian Flynn brings another twisted turn to the plot.<br />Wonderful -- Ms Flynn seems to up the stakes with every book she writes.<br />But perhaps the ending could've been stronger? It seems to kind of end just because it has to. Or is it just me who wanted more!
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game. My kids (age 2 &amp; 4) like to watch me play, and giggle each time I finish a level.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you like twist and turns, this book has plenty, it starts in action with interesting portraits of the characters, but are they who they seem to be? The action with the coating of interesting psychological insights makes it morethan your regular thriller.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Written by my 16-yr-old daughter:  &#34;Alright, to be quite honest I thought this would suck. BUT, this app proved really proved me wrong, the minute I started playing. Easy controls and no rip offs`. All I can really say is if you like my little pony, then do get this game! I don`t regret it. The only weird thing is, is that I there is no option to save...so idk about that. But try it, you just might like it.&#34;
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot. It's great to look at it repeatedly to find the little details that I missed the first time around.
0061992860|5.0|My husband wanted this book to learn survival tips. He is a hunter of all seasons. He has found this book helpful. He has recommended it to friends.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I had an appreciation for what the Seals did, knowing that they are capable of handling extreme tasks& knowing that their lives are on the line for our benefit. However, until I read this book, I really had no concept of the effort, the training & the preparation that is involved. Aside from that, on the personal side, he shared with us (and his wife, family & friends) the struggles that he had, asking for & depending on their support & prayers. Also, love his wife, what a warrior she is!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|They say everybody has a &#34;take&#34; or &#34;view&#34; of things in life, Oren Klaff has his unique view on how business relationships are, and using his view has been a great help to me. In fact, I would've never thought why some people become overlords to others, well Klaff nows and shows us why.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|The actors were all very good.  The story was enjoyable for baseball fans and those who just want a good story.
0060557818|5.0|Wow, what an unusual book!  After reading American Gods, I really shouldn't be surprised, as Neil Gaiman is certainly making a name for himself in the modern, urban fantasy genre.  In this novel, we are introduced to a cast of characters that are among the most original, unusual and thought provoking I've ever encountered.<br /><br />The basis of the novel is the existence of an \\"underground\\" London, inhabited by all those who have fallen between the cracks of society.  Designated as London Below, as opposed to London Above, these highly unusual inhabitants make their way through sewers, underground passages and subterranean vaults and caverns, as well as abandoned tube stations.  In addition, things and people aren't \\"normal\\" in London Below.  Time and space do not follow the same rules as London Above.  Elements of minor magic exist and animals take on human traits (for example, rats are exalted and can communicate).  Once relegated to London Below, there is no return to the surface.  Inhabitants virtually cease to exist and can move unseen and unrecognized on the surface.<br /><br />There were moments when I thought Gaiman went a little too far in his fantasy world, but by and large, it worked for me.  The characters in the novel are amazingly well presented and fleshed out.  The subject of the novel, Richard Mayhew, a drone of sorts in the London financial community, gets drawn into the underworld through accidental contact with one of its denizens, an unlikely heroine by the name of Lady Door.  There, he undergoes a metamorphosis of sorts, as he undertakes the quest that is the backbone of the novel.<br /><br />There are elements of medieval custom and society, as well as characters that you would find in 17th century England.  Most engaging to me, however, were a pair of supernaturally gifted murderous cut throats by the name of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar who appear frequently throughout the story.  As Mr. Croup explains, \\"\\"We are, after all, famed across the entirety of creation for our skills in the excruciatory arts\\"<br /><br />When their methods are questioned by their \\"employer\\" and they are accused of being unprofessional, Mr. Croup proudly explains:<br /><br />\\"Unprofessional?  Us?  Sir.  Might I with due respect remind you that Mister Vandemar and myself burned down the city if Troy?  We brought the Black Plague to Flanders.  We have assassinated a dozen kings, five popes, half a hundred heroes and two accredited gods.  Our last commission before this was the torturing of an entire monastery in sixteenth century Tuscany.  We are utterly professional.\\"<br /><br />There is actually an honest to goodness angel (Islington) who evolves into a fascinating character.  There are references to Atlantis and other mythological personages and places.  And while there is ample violence and scenes of brutality, as Mr. Vandemar notes at one point, \\"\\"Can't make an omelette without killing a few people\\".entirety of creation for our skills in the excruciatory arts\\"<br /><br />When their methods are questioned by their \\"employer\\" and they are accused of being unprofessional, Mr. Croup proudly explains:<br /><br />\\"Unprofessional?

B0053O89K6|5.0|Our family has loved House from the beginning, and this final season completes our collection of the complete series. Hugh Laurie is wonderful!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a good romance novel.  The leading man was wonderful and made for a great fantasy. It does feel like eating candy, though.
B00008G7UF|4.0|Bonita película, entretiene y es agradable incluso para verla en familia.  Me agradó verla en casa y la he recomendado.
B004NELBPC|4.0|The app makes it easy to get the articles on your phone without hunting on the internet. Works well. Happy with it.
B000UBONPW|5.0|This is a winner. Think of it! All the great established blues players loved Stevie and it was because Stevie had magic. What a pity he had to die after he'd cleaned up his act. He was just a boy when he started out and everyone recognized his talent. The fact that Albert King did this record with Stevie Ray Vaughan is living proof of Stevie's great talent. One of my fav's of Stevie's is Tax man - not on this album and originally written by the beatles but when they sang it - it just didn't have the pizazz that Stevie's voice lent it. Any case, this album is great if you are fans of these two blues men.<br /><br />If you drive a car, I'll tax the street,<br />If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat.<br />If you get too cold I'll tax the heat,<br />If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|I was entertained from start to finish.  Maybe these kind of films are geared for the younger set, but I, as a senior, just loved it!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|...and I miss these two....Gus + Hazel.  Yes this book is about kids with cancer which is why I didn't rush to read it but it was non -cloying and beautiful.
B00AHSINKO|2.0|Although both great actors, this movie was boring and sad.  It was not my favorite.  2 Hours I'll never get back.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This had enough differences from the original version to make it worthwhile, and I especially liked the logic of the slightly altered climax. All the acting is fine, but Mara Wilson is completely wonderful.
0062068423|5.0|Alas, those of us reading Nesbo in English have had the books well out of order. This was the second novel in the series but (I think) the first widely available here. Nesbo is a clear leader in Scandinavian Noir, the writing and plotting are quite excellent. Also, it seems like the the translations by Don Bartlett from Norwegian are spot on as well.<br /><br />Ingenious character and plot. Read this before Nemesis and Devil's Star, if you can. Earlier developments are referred to in all the books and it was only late last year that the first book in the series -- The Bat -- was available in the US. In the first book the anti-hero Harry Hole (pronounced Hoew-leh, more or less, NOTthe way it reads in English) is introduced, sent to Australia on a seeming unimportant task to coordinate with the Sydney police on the murder of a Norwegian woman, and winds up uncovering and killing an Australian serial killer.<br /><br />Love to see any of these as a motion picture as long as Tom Cruise isn't cast as Harry...he's more like Dr. House than anyone else.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|This is one of the better movies I have seen in a long time. A bit cheesy at times, but that kinda makes the movie!
1589795474|5.0|If you're really made of the right stuff then by now you'll have discovered that you can buy a used hardcover copy of this book for less than a $1.00 and know that's the way to go ...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|That's how long it took me to read this book. I read it during my work breaks, lunch, and any little spare time.  I can't begin to describe how  great this book is. It  vivid, raw, and  just plain beautiful. I'm really glad  I had a chance  to read  this  and  I hope it is a  enjoyed as much as \\"The Rocky horror Picture Show\\".
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|Chilling and suspenseful. Truly enjoyed this one...we talked about this for awhile after watching about all the details that just made this film such an original. It has twists and turns that are unexpected. It does start off a little slow but not disappointing one bit.
B006MPKD54|4.0|Harry Bosch is a good detective and always gets his man, very entertaining and another one of Michael's books that is hard to put down. Highly recommended to Harry Bosch fans.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|First - purchase of game tokens results in a charge but no credit on my game.... and still waiting for any human responce to fix that.<br />Then go to open game and told it is corrupted and all my efforts are gone - along with anything I paid for.<br />Try again - but the game won't let me expand.<br />I am DONE! TOO MANY ISSUES!

B009YX02T8|4.0|The redeeming quality of the Twilight franchise is its soundtracks, and this one did not disappoint. If you've enjoyed the other four, than this is a must to add to your collection. My personal favorites are:<br /><br />#2: Bittersweet<br />#4: Fire in the Water<br />#5: Everything and Nothing<br />#8: Heart of Stone<br />#11: All I've Ever Needed<br />#13: A Thousand Years (Pt 2)<br /><br />Don't hesitate to pick this up if you're a fan.
B00005MP58|5.0|Firth.  Done.  Just kidding.  This is my favorite film adaptation of my favorite jane austen novel.  True to the book unlike some others I've seen.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The latest installment definitely did not disappoint. There were a few hiccups with the video streaming but very minor. I was thoroughly entertained pretty much from start to finish. Well done.
B006MPK9SU|4.0|Harry Bosch is a good detective and always gets his man, very entertaining and another one of Michael's books that is hard to put down. Highly recommended to Harry Bosch fans. Harry locks heads with Irvin Irving but again he comes out on top even though Irving is an ex cop with a grudge.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The subject matter is quite upsetting and there were many times I didn't think I could take any more tragedies, but I found that I just could not put the book down.  It kept my attention and was a quick, engaging read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved this book....extremely exciting with many twist and turns...couldn't put it down!  I highly recommend this book. Now the 2nd book
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed the romance of this book. The way the main characters meet and fall in love is beautifully written, as well as the love scenes between the two of them. My only complaint is that I do not like reading about childhood sexual abuse and this is one of the main themes. I guess I didn't look at this closely enough before purchasing it.
B005DOKIYG|4.0|I'm loving my new Kindle Fire and was pleased to receive this Zip Sleeve with it.  I tend to bump, drop and knock my books and was afraid of owning an electronic reader.  This zip sleeve may not protect from a really forceful drop, but it has saved my Kindle several times already.  I only wish it doubled as a stand/holder somehow.  I'm still not quite comfortable with holding this new e-reader.
630542845X|1.0|I ordered this Movie to watch with my daughter and the recorded version in it's original format is American English.  However, the version I received was recorded in French.  Very Disappointed.  The cover is in the English Langauge but the DVD again is a French Language Recorded version.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is the first and only book I have ever read front to back and immediately read again. Since then,I have read it and reflected on my life and learned more about my life and myself. It is a must read.
B0025KVLTW|5.0|Great music from the past by the Beatles.Well written music.You will not be disappointed with this musical cd.Buy it now.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It was a very good and interesting book.  I could not put it down.  This book really gets one thinking.
B000FA6720|5.0|The book is simply written, but full of heart and soul.  I believe the only way one can truly appreciate this book or believe this type of love and dedication exist.....is  simply to have lived one of the parts.
B009DKFSUA|5.0|Pitbull is great as usual with this new album.  I love the upbeat dance tracks on it.  It is great for working out!
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is a good movie.  It did have some dull parts but otherwise we enjoyed it very much. Thank you
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Darker is my favorite book in the trilogy. My heart went out to Christian in this book. I don't think I have fallen quite so in love with a character. He is one of the most put together yet seriously broken characters I have ever read. His submissive scene is one I will not forget. I have read that part over so many times now that I've lost count. I think that it is everyone's fantasy to have someone love them so much that the person would give up the deepest part of themselves, and in Christian we witness that fantasy.
B006TTC590|2.0|A very dated movie from the past.I only like the car chase in the movie.Acting was poor and not well written.
B002ZBZNPO|5.0|I was really stoked to purchase my second evanescence cd!!! I can't wait to buy more!!! Evanescence has always been my favorite band!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter's new IPhone, she tested it and said it's &#34;perfect&#34;.  She tested it in the water etc. and said it does what it says.  This was a great purchase on my part and my granddaughter is thrilled.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love this album of Bruno Mars.  It is even better than his last one...if that is even possible...great purchase!
B009UKUGXC|5.0|You don't have to love maths to love this book. Fermat's Last Theorem is an inspirational story that makes maths interesting.
B003SHDSRE|3.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a good writer.  Do I find her particularly insightful, or her story interesting? Not really. Then again, this is one woman's story. To critique someone's personal story amounts to expressing whether or not we &#34;like&#34; the person or what she has to say. The writing is good enough and her story inoffensive. For a treatment on spirituality, this isn't the book to read and it doesn't pretend to be. For a leisurely read about someone with whom the reader might have some experience in common, I can see it being enjoyable.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Great action pack movie by Clint Eastwood.Well written story and as well produce.The acting was very good by all the players.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|if this game was a banana it would be a good banana. the only thing wrong is it is not a banana
B003O86FMW|4.0|I hate cliff hangers... but it's worth the read I can't wait to start the next book. All in all a good book.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I am always a huge fan of Christina Aguilera's music.  She didn't dissappoint on this one either.  I am very glad I bought it.
B009MB682W|5.0|The Bond films have had a lot of good music by great performers. This collection captures it! It's really a pretty diverse set of music, but I can't imagine any music lover that wouldn't enjoy it.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|This is definitely an entertaining book.  Bourdain writes the way he speaks: candidly, bluntly and with style. He is an intelligent and unpretentious writer. Of course it isn't going to be everyone's cup o'tea nor should this book be a textbook at Le Cordon Bleu. If you like Bourdain on &#34;No Reservations&#34; or even his guest spots on &#34;Top Chef&#34;, this book is exactly how you might imagine a book by him. Read it and enjoy.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|This music cd was rated as a general rock n roll music.It should been rated as alternitive music. I was disappointed with this one.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|This has helped me improve my personality. Also helps me improve my social skills. My problem is public speaking,it has not quite fixed my problem yet but has helped a little. Thanks:) very good book
0765325950|5.0|I started reading WOT when I was in high school and am now 25. There were times when I could see Brandon Sanderson's work instead of RG's, but Sanderson was able to bring all the weaves together to give us our ending. By they way I also have a kindle and hardly read paperback books, but had this book on my doorstep on the day it was released. For someone who grew up with these books, it is upsetting to see people give bad reviews because the book is not yet available on kindle, get over it! I would just like to say thank you Robert Jordon for opening the world of fantasy to a 13 year old and Thank you Brandon Sanderson for continuing his legacy.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love every single track on this album.  I think this is the first Alicia Keys album I have bought.  What have I been waiting for :)
1433502445|4.0|Like the ESV Version, the study notes are very small print.  Otherwise it is great.<br /><br />ESV Study Bible.  Ilike the maps and study notes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is great. I use it for everything - work home writing receipts meeting minutes phone calls pictures websites - on multiple devices -laptop phone kindle etc
B0043URV5U|5.0|Great music old and new.Alot of hits by Bob.Very well written songs and produce well.You will not be disappointed with this one.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|My single best air travel tech purchase following noise canceling headset. It rejuvinates sound from in flight movies and the eq gives me back bass and fullness of sound without that airline hiss that you get when cranking up the volume on the in flight entertainment system. Good for ten hours worth of use. Loved it on yesterday's flight between sfo and hong kong.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|A thoroughly half-assed development of a truly fascinating premise. It was like a high school student's work. Immature! A  team of sceintist/astronauts that takes space travel more casually than a night walk in central park, a geologist that does not once look at a rock, a biologist who looks at a new species and simply goes she's beautiful without showing any caution, a fetus that grows 50 times in size without any food ... I could go on and on, but it will be enough to say that if i pulled out one hair from my beard for every time my intelligence was insulted in the movie, I would not need a razor by the end of it.
1416549447|5.0|I can't  say enough. This book should be worth more than I purchased it! I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Creative movie that inspired some thought at times. Good Sunday afternoon movie. Both young and old alike can find a reason to enjoy this movie.
B001U3Y5XE|1.0|I was very disappointed with this game.  We love Pictionary and I thought the combination with Legos would be fun.  It was way too slow.  Maybe the generation that grew up with Legos would appreciate it, but our 7 year old grandson found it had to do and as adults we felt the things we were asked to create were nearly impossible to create with Legos.  It was also, very expensive compared to other games we have purchased.
B0087ZG7NO|5.0|Plenty of action in this movie.A well written story as well produce.Very good special effects.The acting by the stars is very good.
B008Z9L94O|3.0|This is my favorite SP album, so I was really excited about this box set being released.  It didn't start out well, since Amazon shipping it WITHOUT a box!  Seriously, it was wrapped in shrink wrap and sitting in the snow of my front porch.  WTH Amazon?!  The sound quality of the records themselves leave a lot to be desired.  I'm happy to have it, but for the money, you better really love the SP.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|This box set is about as good as it gets!<br />I missed most of season one, and being able to see all of it now is great!
B000002IO1|5.0|Perfect is the word that comes to mind when I try to describe your gift. I don't think I could have given myself anything better
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The movie was great but the video stream to my TV kept stopping & I had to restart.  It's not my equipment ..this has never happened before...
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Victor Hugo made it also a refresher in history about Waterloo - in depth. He jumps around with different dates sometimes hard to follow. I wanted to read the book because I saw the play years ago and never had the time to read the book before. The play is much easier to follow. When the opportunity arrises I plan on seeing  the movie as well.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie has plenty of action in it.The special effects are great.Well written story as well produce.The acting is good.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Good and entertaining book. The whole storyline is rather unrealistic, but the scenario as such is well described and you feel entertained after having read the book.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages.  The only thing that is missing is closed captioning, other than that, we love it!!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|It was an exciting movie with a lot of action. Jeremy Renner brought a nice new fresh feel to the franchise
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I downloaded the free version of this alarm clock and found it very user friendly and quite handy. The music that the alarm uses isn't jarring, but actually quite pleasant. I decided to pay for the upgrade in order to be able to set multiple alarms as well as to have access to the weather summary. This is for my kindle fire if that's helpful to you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book so much I could read it twelve thousand times! It's almost like the best book I've ever read! I could go on and on
B000022TSY|3.0|A dated movie from the late sixties.The acting was poor and not well written as well as produce.Save your money.
1449410243|5.0|though I don't own a cat, I'm now able, with certainly, to confirm that my aunt's cat is loaded with evil and hairballs. A must read for those who fear felonious felines.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Entertaining and interesting.  Very good insights into the personalities and strategies of those that lead this Nation. I'd recommend it to anyone interested on the operations of government at the highest levels.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I really loved the music and I really enjoyed the music and the songs on the cd. It is solid sounds from great a singer with enjoyable tunes.

B005Q1W0ZQ|1.0|wouldn't play.... I'm returning it. tried on two different players and it would not play.  so disappointed with the christmas gift.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We are totally addicted to this series.  We can't get enough.  We pulled the plug on cable about 2 years ago so were always a day behind.  We don't care.  It has been so thrilling this season.  If your not watching this you don't know what your missing!
0767803434|5.0|A great action pack movie.Alot of good acting from everyone in the movie. Well written story and produce.A real thiller.
0425252868|5.0|Compassion, that word speaks through this book. I believe pilots share a bond between each other, even if they are on the other side of the wire.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Too derivative and remindful of many other movies, like it borrowed from The Terminator, Back to the Future, Twelve Monkeys, Blade Runner, Inception, Scanners/Matilda/and even the Twilight Zone episode with Bill Mumy as the boy with special powers who can make dead the adults who annoy him. Bruce Willis' subdued performances are always his best, and this was another one. Quite good. Emily Blunt does very well coming across as a rural farm woman of the Plains -- not bad for an English actor! And the ending has a couple nice twists.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Then it started to shut down. Then lost everything and it started over. Started playing again and it did it again. Unfortunately I uninstalled the game.
0385486804|3.0|I needed to buy this book for a college course and I knew our book store was over priced, After searching the Web, Amazon was the cheapest I found. Not the greatest book though, but then again I don't like to read...

B0025KVLTM|5.0|Great music from the beatles from the late sixties.You will not be disappointed with this cd.Well written songs and produce.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|A predictable movie with no surprises. It doesn't reach any great heights but reminds us of older times when parents held themselves aloof from their children without considering the consequences their (supposedly) noble actions may have on the children.
1573229725|5.0|Wow!! it has been a long time since I read a book like this! Its a total page turner. Each chapter keeps you at the edge of your seat and makes you want to keep reading. Very entertaining and it has twists. It had me in a total: what!, no way!, uuhhh!Omg!<br />You won't want the book to end!! Guaranteed!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this book was very good I would have given it 4 1/2 stars but it wouldn't let me.  It was well written in feelings, deep I mean.  Made me realize just how I'd feel if I were Holden and this had happen to me.  From Holden's view point it was insightful.  Well worth the money
B007SGM084|5.0|Good value on this book. very dumb it requires so many words to post a review on this product review
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I had been looking in the stores for this for a long time. I could never find it anywhere. I then ordered it online, it came in no time at all, I love this movie.....
B001OQCV2E|5.0|A very good sci-fi movie about the end of the world.The acting is real good.Well written story and produce well.
1451696191|5.0|This book is GREAT.  A truly personal and down to Earth story, told from a young man's perspective through first person as a letter to an unknown friend.  This book is gripping and brushes topics such as  sex, drugs, and the rock horror picture show through a unique perspective.<br /><br />At most times, I didn't feel like I was reading a novel.  I felt like I was reading a brutaly honest and effective autobiography, written by a young man and what it means to grow up.  It's not always pretty, and it usually is not.  This book will remind you of what we often too soon forget as people.  It also might make you laugh and cry.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is not as good as Bad Piggies or Angry Birds, but it is fun and a good way to waste some time in an airport.

B0025KVLTC|4.0|Another great cd by the beatles from the past.Very well written music.You will not be disappointed with this one.Buy it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Everyone in public life needs to be able to inspire and encourage by the power of oratory, but when the man destined to be King has a painful stammer, the future looks bleak indeed.<br />But with kindness, patience, and unfailing, strong support, the King discovers strength to inspire the allied world at war.  King George VI  was never expected to become the Monarch of Great Britain and the Commonwealth of Nations, but he overcame his own personal difficulties with such determination he was able to lead his nation to victory!<br />The crowned King of the British Commonwealth of Nations and an Australian speech therapist form an amazing working partnership to give the King the freedom to address crowds and inspire them with hope and the conviction to challenge the horror of war on English soil.
B0085RZ9C4|4.0|Dawkins does a very good job of making his case.  I think he is probably right in his thesis about there being no god.  But, my only hesitation is that Dawkins is as fervent in his disbelief as any preacher on Sunday morning is in his belief.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|I just luv watching the Bundy's. I've been a fan for years. As others have said it is the complete season and the discs are just in one big case, not individually in boxes for each season. But to me it is not a big deal, it's still the Bundy's.  ---  \\"Go Bundy's!\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good light reading.  Felt like this was more of a teenage type book rather than an adult book but it was quick, light reading.
B005LAII12|5.0|The DVD worked great!  My boyfriend loved this as a gift.  I can't wait to watch it the unrated version
B001AP11KW|3.0|An ok music cd.A few good songs on it.Spend your money on something else that you might like so you wont be disappointed like me.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great app for the kids. It is fast paced and alot of fun. Adults even enjoyed playing this app. Good for the $$$$$$ (free).  :)
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|We loved the Lorax movie. I bought a new copy just in time for Christmas. This seller was great and sent it quick. Thanks for making my son happy with the DVD. I would buy from this seller again anytime. Thanks again!
B00APUQT7I|3.0|there were some funny parts but overall it was boring and predicable. i don't think i would buy it.... sad i rented it for 4 when i could have gone to redbox and gotten it for 1.  ohwell.... at least i didn't have to drive out in the snow.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Very enjoyable read. I am a big fan of Lee Child's writing and also Jack Reacher as a character anyway, so that helped!
0765325950|3.0|My first feeling upon putting the book down after finishing it on friday evening was melancholy. I can't believe this series, which has been a part of my life for 20 years, longer than my marriage (!)is actually over. I have not been able to shake this sadness since. I do want to thank Ms. MacDougal and Mr. Sanderson for deciding to and perservering to finish this enormous series. It was a very difficult decision and task and they did it quickly and as well as could be expected under the circumstances.<br /><br />After reading this final volume, it became clearer to me that the three final volumes TGS, TOM, and AMOL should be all considered one volume, as Mr. Jordan had intended. In other words, AMOL cannot really stand on its own, even as a single volume of a series ... it simply does not have enough variety. If one considers it as a third of a single volume, however, the concentration and sheer number of pages devoted to Tarmon Gaidon makes sense.<br /><br />Spoiler alert: read no further if you don't want detailed book info ...<br /><br />Successes: the series is truly ended in that all major plot lines are addressed. this is, I'll admit, a huge success on a very difficult task. I was very satisfied about the treatment of the Egwene storyline (what a heroic end and what a beautiful answer to Balefire), the Lan storyline, Birgitte and the horn were worked in nicely, the forsaken, especially Demandred and M'Heal handled well, nice (and appropriate!) endings for Graendal and Moghedien. Tarmon Gaidon itself was well-described and Mat was handled well there. Loved the bit about the use of the dragin canons at the end of the battle using gateways ... awesome.<br /><br />The failures: First and most important, what the hell happened to Shaitan??? Here's this unbelievably evil and powerful figure built up through all the previous volumes and in this book he looks quite petty and small and can be fooled easily. A force that can sicken the entire world (while barely touching it) and Rand with the help of two women and (unwilling) help of Moridin can pin him down completely? Very unrealistic and unsatisfying. Btw, should the result of the imprisoning of the Dark One again not have been a new floating crystal prison (Shaitan's prison which was broken by Lanfear to begin the end of the age of legends)? After all, the wheel is returning here to the beginning, is it not?<br /><br />Secondly, several of the major characters and stories, some of them with us from the beginning, did not receive enough closure in my view. The Fain and Moridin endings especially seemed weird and abrupt. Loial was given a little love but, not like Mr. Jordan would have. Perrin was generally missing, but, again, if the three final volumes are counted as one, his storyline was adequately addressed. The Aiel future and Seanchan future were also left up in the air ... some hints would have been appropriate.<br /><br />At the end of the first volume (Eye of the World), the temporary victory over shadow produced a tremendous result in the health of the world ... the much more definitive victory over the shadow in this book should have had tremendous impacts, no? Very very abrupt ending after the victory ... needed an extended epilogue, in my view.<br /><br />Finally, what the heck happened with Rand/Moridin? Is the ending of riding off into the sunset (with three loved women left behind) a realistic end for the personality of Rand? Really? Unsatisfying, to say the least.<br /><br />Well, for WOT fans, a chapter of our life is completed. It needed to be and thanks to those who made it so. It was not perfect ... probably could not be for this complex a story. But it is done.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Alot of action.Very good acting by all the stars.Very well written story and produce well.Denzel is top of his game.
B005LAII80|5.0|I loved the Stallone Judge Dredd movie as a kid.  It was my only exposure to the character before this movie, Dredd.  I heard good things about this movie, and bought it to check it out.<br /><br />I missed the futuristic flying cars, and robots, and mutants of Stallone's movie because I love that type of stuff, and Stallone's uniform almost perfectly matched the comics, but this movie was so much better, as far as plot and characters.  Production design and cityscapes felt like we could live in this world in my lifetime, and I found that to be really scary, and it made me nervous the whole movie (in a good way).  After watching the extras on the Blu Ray, I feel like they made a very faithful adaptation of the character, and stayed true to who he is.  Karl Urban is one of my favorite actors, and he did a fantastic job at being a badass. Lena was great as Ma-Ma.  I don't think there was a poor performance by anyone in this movie.  It was VERY gory (really earned that R rating), and had some innovative kills, if you like that sort of thing.  Slow motion shots were impressive, and I'd love to see it on a 3D tv.  One of the highest compliments I could pay is to the CGI, as I often could not tell that some of the city or the main building, Peach Trees, was computer animated (only realized it after watching featurettes, and I always look for CGI during a movie).  These filmakers should be very, very proud of what they did with the limited budget they had.  I would definetely recommend it to action movie fans, and would see the sequel in theaters, if they get to make one.  It wasn't just a shoot 'em up, as the Judges had to use their wits and skills to make it out alive, not just their guns (which when used, were awesome).  The mini-gun scene was so visceral and real, it was fantastic.<br /><br />Botton line - I bought it at full price without seeing it before purchase, and I'm glad I did.  No regrets.  I actively regret not seeing it in theaters in 3D.  I hope there is asequel with a higher budget.
B00AFWEPVI|5.0|I have only recently started to use everything on the Kindle. I am sure that this will be a wonderful camera.
B007MU85D0|4.0|I highly recommended this cd for fans of the Head and the Heart or Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros.
067960085X|4.0|The novella is of a woman of much experience though only 20 who the narrator meets in his New York apartment house.  She is Holly Golightly, who was married at 14 but says that does not count since whe was so young.  The narrator, who seems like Capote himself, is attracted to her as she lives her wild extravagant life, wih many men friends, and her escape at the end.  A Pretty entertaining wild story.  Of the three short stories, the most appreciated was \\"A Christmas Memory\\" which tells of a 7-year-old boy and his 60 year old cousin preparing for Christmas, making 30 fruitcakes, including one for President Roosevelt, finding a Christmas tree, and making gifts for each other.  I found it poignant and memorable.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies every. The lines in this movie are just classic and now it's here to enjoy in full-HD.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|A great mob movie.De Niro is once again at his best. A very well written story and produce well also.The acting is good
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|I was really excited about this movie only to be highly disappointed. I was hoping it would be more of a time travel thriller and was disappointed that time travel only happened once in the movie. The story line was a good concept that went wrong and came across as more cheesy then serious. I don't normally make fun of or laugh at movies like this but my husband and I found ourselves laughing at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives an amazing performance as well as Emily Blunt...if it weren't for the cheesy parts that made me laugh more than sympathize.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Really wasn't that interesting of a read after having seen the movie. I hope the second is more g gripping for me. I'm sure it's far better for those who haven't seen the film.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Lets you see both sides and there are decent people on both sides of war, very uplifting and sad at times
B00A8ECU24|2.0|I played the game for about 2 weeks buying (With earned in-game money. I'm not paying cash for this crap) ponies, land , and shops, only to lose it all. I was playing earlier today with no problem. I went to get back on just recently and it completely restarted itself for some reason. My 3 year old wanted to play but it is far too easy to accidentally buy the money and gems that the game wants you to. I'll be deleting this app since there is no point with trying to get anywhere since it doesn't save your progress.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book will have you on the edge throughout.  It was a fantastic read with a surprise ending.  Just when you think you've got it figured out Mr. Grisham throws you a monkey wrench.  Malcolm Bannister is exceptional with the story he created to get out of jail.  It was his &#34;get out of jail free card&#34; and in the end there was nothing anyone could do about it.  If you like a book that's going to keep you on the edge of your seat, then The Racketeer is the book for you.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Great new R & B music.If you like this kind of sound you will not be disappointed by this artist.
B00890JFMW|5.0|I love the composer. Most of his themes make me fly somewhere during the composition. It has a good selection of themes
B00APUQRPC|3.0|It was a nice little movie. I would not run out and see it right away. You could wait until it came on really tv or cable.
B009ZQ8FQG|1.0|I just wanted to see the marriage, and see how they were all doing. I know I will be sorry when the series ends.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I thought this was an excellent action movie that is humorous too. The movie, with its star studded cast, is highly recommended.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My wife and I recently attended the play &#34;Wicked&#34; in NYC for the first time and decided to buy this soundtrack as a followup. It exceeded our expectations and is an wonderful reminder of the performance we enjoyed in person. Although the cast is different now, the lyrics are clear and the music is beautiful and haunting. It is easy to recall the spectacular scenes and performances as you listen/sing along. A special bonus that comes with this CD is the liner notes that include the full text of the songs as well as some interesting photographs and an introduction by the author of the original book &#34;Wicked&#34; (1995) the the play is based upon. If you are a fan of the play then this is an essential item to add to your collection.
B00005QY5Y|3.0|I found only one good song. It was from a movie sound track ,other wise it is not worth buying.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I had some doubts as it was clear this is a &#34;woman's book&#34; but as a guy I had a lot of fun reading the gossip and chatter about people I have often seen on television. Also, learned a lot about the elusive 'art of improv' which Ms. Fey explains so well. She is a fine writer and it is fun to share in her life.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|There is nothing better then getting the entire series and be able to watch it when you want to.  The set includes a booklet describing all of the episodes and each season.  The extra features on the DVD are also excellent.  Watching this series is addicting.I highly recommend this.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wanted to read this because of the movie coming out. Now I am  not sure the movie could do justice to the book. Charlie is a salute to all kids who feel left out and don't know how to fix that. It's gave me a good feeling when he began to find his way. Whether you have seen the movie or not, you should read this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful series...fascinating to imagine the sense of reality each of the characters lived within. Worth the watch...you will be grateful the time frame we live in.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It was a great story, I laughed and cried. I didn't want it to end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because kids love it I mean  like even my brother loves it because you can play them over and over he even snuck my  tablet over night to play this game so I think you should get it
B009MF56GC|5.0|This is an even bigger celebration of everything we love about these guys and their movies!<br /><br />Although I really liked the first one too much to give a damn about its flaws, the second is an obvious improvement in a lot of ways. The best for me is Simon West's directing style. Now here's a guy that knows not just how to make the action hit you hard and fast, but also give the whole thing the right tone so that it didn't seem to take itself too seriously for us to just have fun with it (even though the stupid cover doesn't give that impression). And it sure is loads of fun, way more than the first in fact, not to mention funnier. The Chuck Norris bits were piss-your-pants hilarious! And it should be a sad fact that even Jet Li has very little screen time, but there's just so much asskicking going by so many bad asses, it's hard to think who's missing.<br /><br />My only minor little complaint - and maybe I'm being too greedy here - is that the final stand-off between Stallone and Van Damme feels like it should've lasted longer. Then again, I don't know what would have been long enough for us to be satisfied to watch these two guys beat the crap out of each other.<br /><br />Whatever happens, and a lot does, the movie still leaves you feeling like you just got back from the reunion of a lifetime. Buy it, watch it, love it!
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Great Family fun and connection with our adult children.  Life gets busy and We don't always keep in touch with friends and family. This great little game is a nice way to interact with both friends and family (even chat messaging) on a daily basis.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Great CD; love his voice & talent.  Very different from all the others that we own.  It's jazzy ~ good background music.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It took me no time to read all three books. The first book had a few parts that made me uncomfortable.  The second and third books, had a developing relationship between the characters that kept me HOOKED!!! :-) Great series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|omg when I first got it it was boring now I'm addicted to this game and I love it I think it is better than temple run 1 reason for sure this game doesn't have a cheat. so th I recommend all u people yo get this game u guys might not get the same effect as me but u knw we are all &quot;different&quot;  rate this 5 stars plz I want it to be the best game plz oh plz do thy for me and the one who created this game.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Was also a Christmas gift. Order arrived promptly and in perfect condition. The CD itself is great! My niece listened to it all day Christmas!
B00594XOZU|3.0|my daughter loves it<br />and she tells all her friends about it and they also love using this app and are happy
B003I55BIA|5.0|I could not put it down! It was amazing because I can relate to Alex in so many ways including our culture.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I was very disappointed in the book.  Once I got a handle on the all of the characters (there is around 22) the book seemed dragged on and on.  The premise of the book is great but it could of been written  a 100 pages shorter
111846446X|5.0|Sorry for the quick review but I haven't read the book front to back yet, just skimmed most of the book.  The book provides a great overview for the Raspberry Pi, what it can do, and the linux operating system.  A great quick starter/introduction guide.  Although it doesn't go into great detail on any of the subjects it is a good introduction to what you can do with the Pi and how to get started with linux and everything else.  Definitely can't beat it for the price and it's good to have on hand to get some ideas.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|This book is thoroughly researched, written concisely and understandably. It's a truly terrifying look at the systematic biases that lie behind our best attempts to deliver quality medicine.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is great! Love the graphics and story. I play lots of these and this is close to the top. Thanks!
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a good game if you want to kill some time. There is lots to do in it. The only thing I don't like about it is that you only have to find three things in each level.
B0012IWHDW|5.0|Haunting, the soundtrack that will take you elsewhere if you're not careful. I mean without any enhancements<br />you may miss those exits and keep driving for as long as you have this soundtrack playing.<br />Back in the day when it came out I used to ask my boyfriend to &#34;skip&#34; to &#34;Heavens Door&#34;<br />but, when I finally bought the cassett (back in the day) I played the whole album and never &#34;skipped&#34;<br />again. Then of course I bought the CD. Just had to have it.  Could not get it on itunes.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I like all the selections, but it's quite varied so if you don't enjoy one as much you'll like the next one.  Keeps growing on me.<br />I have given it to family members also.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|loved the movie I had to own a copy after renting it.It's definitely a keeper.  Johnny Depp is yummy<br />streaming was perfect
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as much suspense as I thought it would be. Easy to figure out. Not enough insight about the reason he didn't question the money transfer that started his downfall.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME ITS SOOOO ADDICTING . This saves my life when I'm bored or I just don't wanna hear someone talk (:
B004V9MU86|4.0|This was a wonderful book. Different, authentic, powerful. The characters will stay with me a long time. I enjoyed every word and it made me see the world differently. I thought having Death as narrator was a brilliant way to approach this. Since reading it I find myself noticing the colours of nature around me more. Not just sky colours - all colours.  To me this was a positive story in a very negative setting.<br />The only reason I give four stars and not five was nothing to do with the story itself. It was the handwritten sections which really troubled me. I was reading late at night on my kindle and wished to continue reading but could not read the tiny handwriting. I had to wait until next day and go and find a magnifying glass. A normal one was no use. I had to find a super-powerful magnifying glass to read that handwriting.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Fun movie.  Our 3 and 5 year olds both liked the movie.  I might have liked it more than them, but they definitely liked it also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|so addicting I love it! you must get this game and try and top your friends high scores. let all your friends and family know about this awesome game they wont be disappointed.<br />good luck and have fun! so many levels and missions to beat it never gets old.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like a few others I`m stuck in the manager`s office.  The cabinet door is locked with no key anywhere.  I`'ve been thru almost to the end because the piece(s) from the cabinet aren't needed `til then.  THREE TIMES!!!  Also no sign of a key in the strategy guide or the walkthrough on YouTube.  I've gotten pretty good at these types of games but I`m lost on this one.  Is it me or the game?<br />I usually don`t mind paying for a good game - and the game was GREAT `til I got stuck - but when I can`t finish it it doesn't seem worth it...  Playing on Kindle Fire 2nd gen. And PLEASE people, wait `til you finish a game before you give it a good review.  Some of us base our purchases on what you say.<br /><br />**UPDATE**3-26-13**I read in one of the newer reviews about the key for the cabinet being in the book on the desk.  Well, it is.  And you can find it as soon as you get into the manager's office.  (Yes, it was me and not the game that was lame.) This is a really great game.  I highly recommend. I now give it **5 stars**.  Thank you, kind reviewer, for getting me unstuck!  And thanks, G5, for a terrific game.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I like this book because it teaches me about Greek mythology.I will read the next book after this book! Yeah!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|My daughter has played Temple Run on an iPhone and enjoys it, so when I found that I could get for the Kindle I did.  She loves it and it entertains her for a few minutes here and there when I need her occupied!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Just mediocre, hods your attention but a weak plot and too many drawn out chase scenes.<br />Poor acting and poor characterization.  Won't watch it again.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun game and challenging enough to keep you going. I used up all my hints! I didnt know you only got three for the game before you can buy more but st least they are cheap.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|The show is great and the blu-ray picture is perfect on my 42&#34; lcd, sound is also good on my 5.1 surroud sound.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love having Yahoo! mail. It keeps up updated with the latest version. And it keeps my mail in order. I have no problems.
1476715904|3.0|SPOILERS**<br />  I neither liked nor disliked this book. If you're looking for a book with a lot of happy moments, I wouldn't suggest this one. Not to say it doesn't have a good ending. The two main characters struggle with their relationship throughout the entire book, only resolving it in the last chapter. The main character started out ok but once she foundout her mom had cancer, it went downhill for me. What kid would be more upset that their parent didnt tell them right away instead of being upset that they're dying? It takes her days to get over it and actually talk to her mom again. So to sum it up, her mothers sickness overtook their struggling relatoinship for me.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Not much to do.  Some Challenges, but all you can really do is buy animals and click to feed.  Only good if you are huge Ice Age fan.
0439023491|5.0|I read this series and now my niece is reading it as well and she loved it so much!  Great way to connect to your young reader to find some common ground when they are just starting to get into the teenage years and finding ways to not connect lol.
1401902197|5.0|this book is really good it gives good afirmations and its and easy read.  would defintely recommend.  Nicely illustrated.  thanks.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I'm about 40 hours into Persona 4 Golden. I didn't have a chance to play Persona 4 when it graced the PS2. Considering the age of the game, it doesn't feel dated at all. The alternating periods between managing your social life and dungeon crawling are perfectly timed to keep game play fun and exciting. The story is deep and captivating, bringing you into the Persona 4 world so much so that you really feel connected to the characters in the game. I can't wait to play Persona 4 Arena once I complete P4.<br /><br />Borderlands 2 was my favorite game heading towards the end of the year, but P4 really won out quite handily through its exciting story and game play.
B004UHSB5A|2.0|I really don't get dominoes. It would have been easier if I new how to play. But it also would have been nice to be able to have help and better instructions on how to play.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|oh the money I spent...the hours...the joy... the heartache...the stratagey...even the occasional &quot;bump&quot;..snickers..hehe.  loved the game then love it now.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great MLP app, very interactive.  get to play games with ponies, and build your own ponyville.  My 4yr old and 10yr old both love to play.<br />We play all the time.
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one of those albums were you can simply press play and enjoy.  They have an interesting sound, but very melodic.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another great book by Patricia Cornwell! Full of suspense keeping the reader intrigued! I have always loved her writing and this book is no different. Can't wait to read more by her!!!
0525478817|4.0|Once I started reading it, I couldn't stop. Read it in basically one sitting. Wonderful love story. It was simply amazing.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a great book to read. I have read them twice and it will stay in my collection. I would recommend this book to teens and young adults. I think that it could be bad for younger kids to read.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|I watched This is England on Netflix and found it to be an enjoyable albeit a vague movie about the skinhead culture or counter culture depending on how you perceive it. The movie basically has to do with the segregation between the skinheads, one section is just the traditional skinhead while the other section is the new nationalist skinhead. I was uninformed about what a skinhead actually was, it was my understanding that skinhead instantly meant a racist, however this wasn't the case as one of the skinheads is of Jamaican descent. All in all it's an enjoyable movie if you are looking for something a little different, a fan of British, movies or just want to check out a movie with solid performances and a good story.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Love its simple and just what I needed. I love how you can use it in many ways. Love it.!.!.!.!.!.!.!.!
0345803507|5.0|This was by far the best of all three books.  In fact I read it in just one day, just couldn't put it down.
B007V65R54|5.0|A remarkable review of the complex concepts of prediction and forecasting.  The book is a real-world application of statistical approaches, tempered with a grounding in the human assessment of risk; it's a must read for anyone interested in understanding the world around us.  Silver turns what can be a dry and somewhat mind-numbing topic into a page-turner.  While he gained his fame in political prognostication, this book reveals him to be a very bright guy who enjoys in an almost playful way the rigors of statistics.
034580404X|3.0|You can see how this originally started as Twilight fanfiction. It's basically a mature twilight with an abundance of sex.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good read.
B0064T6LV8|3.0|I have not played pinball for a long time it was great to play. It is great for when I need something to do.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|if you like querky movies this is it . slighty offbeat but funny with great 50s music. Johnny Depp  plays the part great
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The perks of being a wallflower was a very easy yet interesting read! I couldn't stop reading once I started.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|It was a lot of fun! This would be a fantastic movie to watch with a group. I would see this one again.
B00A5052YE|5.0|The music is great.  It's nice to see someone who has become a mother not lose traction in her career, and she appears to have incorporated that part of her life beautifully.
0545265355|5.0|The story of Katniss Everdeen and how she unwillingly started an all-out revolution. They will leave you wanting for more.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This app was a waste of my money. It was just not fun at all I would not play the game again. It had not story really, had not hints and just made no sense to me.
0385535147|5.0|I have read ever single John Grisham book like many other people and I can not get enough of his books. This one was as exciting as all of t he others.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book goes on and on and on....Very interesting, but way too wordy for me.  I would not read it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i have  been waiting for this but well its theres no caves no obsidian no tp/ but its the best app to come to kindle fire oh and no armor and it even shows a picture on the craft table
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|Love this movie! The kids love super heroes. We have watched it several times. I fall in love with the Captain everytime.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book brought me to tears. By far the most inspirational book that I have ever read. I am left wanting to read everything Coelho has written.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this app. I would like having maybe 2 to 3 levels of this app instead of one for each game played.
038572179X|3.0|This story is unnecessarily long. I wouldn't have to struggle through the war in France, which occupies almost one third of the book. And the events in France feel arbitrary as I find out in the ending chapter.<br /><br />The first part is amazing. It tells about the demon in a writer's heart.<br /><br />I feel being fooled in the last part. It is like to say here that all I have written above in this review is a lie. I would have given the book five stars were there be a bad headache like the one I have just had. I would even say the story is too short. It all depends.
B0031CO3WA|4.0|I had been looking for a plane for my son's 3rd birthday, and finding a larger plane that wasn't remote controlled was very hard. I have bought Schleich products and have been very pleased, so when i saw this plane I had to purchase it. It's a bit large for my 3 year but looks good, has lots of neat features. It is very easy to put together, feels durable, opens up to put a pilot and cargo inside.  I do believe this will be fun for years to come.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd is one of those movies that just gets it right. From the stunning 3D slo-mo (no pun intended) action sequences to the solid story line that stays true to it's comic book counterpart, this adaptation is well worth the watch. The score is very interesting and fits perfectly into the narrative and no corn-ball acting, as seen in the old sly version, is to be found. This movie takes itself seriously and by all means it should. If you want to invest in a flick that will do your 3D tv justice or just add a solid entry into your blu-ray collection, Dredd delivers. I judge this title 5/5 stars!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Love the game. Hate to ad interruptions. Our family plays this for hours and can't wait for their own turns.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|For the book I thought it was a good read.  I actually only got this book though because my daughter needed to have it for her English class.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The games really just didn't have any appeal to me to keep playing and keep the app. I really got board with it after and hour.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Bruce Willis was more involved in the action and story line than his previous film. The young Bruce Willis was a great fit and reminiscent of Start Trek young crew picks. His voice even sounded familiar. Had a great ending.
B00APUQKDG|1.0|Worst movie ever! And not even I'm that cool sense of low_budget cult following art films that aren't necessarily pretentious, but are uniquely different. No, this was a complete and utter waste of time! Also, the image quality of Amazon instant HD videos are horrible, with the constant fluttering.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Stallone? check. Statham? check. Norris? check. Arnie? Check. Van Damme? check. 5-star rating from this user? check. Everything you could ever want in a action movie and so much more! Want a bonus? NO F-BOMBS so you can watch it with your parents!
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My girls love this. They get very creative. Now I just have to manage the fighting over whose turn it is.
B00006LFGD|5.0|I hadn't listen to music in quite a while. This brought back so many wonderful moments in my life, I was so glad a I Looked for the cd.  This is music for every age.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am on it all the time. I don't have any problems being able to use it on my phone or kindle fire.
B0076DELIG|3.0|but this one didn't hit it out of the park. He's still the best writer of the genre. I will look forward to his next book.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Stream to Roku over wireless worked flawlessly. No observable artifacts seen on bedroom 32&#34; LCD at 720P. Being Pixar, the quality of animation and more importantly, story line, were top notch.
B000002G0P|5.0|Extreme's third installment of music history didn't disappoint.  After their debut, self-titled, album and Pornograffitti, expectations were high.  While I can't say I'm certain that the lyrical work stacks up to their first two, the music is great, and the guitar work is stellar.  All in all, the third side of the story is that this was a really solid album from a band I wish had never broken up, which is ironic, because I really wish they'd never released their fourth album.
B005HSL626|4.0|Good fun. My son really gets a kick out slicing through the fruit with his finger like a sword. He even avoids the bombs.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Thanks to you Mr. tony BEnnett  for painting some wonderful music to enhance  the moon, the sun and the  sky.<br />I want to thank you for opening up many closed doors for me. You have opened my spirits, my mind and my soul.<br />Thank you!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I don't mind this version. But I tried others and this one is not my favorite app to play mahjong with.
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst book I have ever read, and I have read my fair share of unrealistic romance novels. I love Disney films, and I am a total sucker for the whole fantasy of a rich but flawed Prince Charming coming into my life to sweep me off of my feet, and who unwittingly falls in love with me and becomes the perfect Prince Charming because of his love for me. However, this book is awful. For a female protagonist who is supposed to be beautiful, charming, witty and intelligent, Ana's actions paints her as the stupidest woman alive, and I find nothing arousing about her! Christian is no less insufferable. This is an \\"erotic\\" novel written by an author with very little, if any, experience in sex and relationships. It would be more worthwhile to read a silent film review written by a blind person.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great great great book!! All I can say!! Really really really enjoyed it. Have recommened to several friends and they loved it too. Several friends have read it as well and they loved it too!
0802473156|5.0|The Five Love Languages takes an approach to relationships and communication that I never would have considered before reading this book.  It definitely applies to all relationships, regardless of whether or not you're married.  The author, Gary Chapman, asks the reader to examine the ways people in relationships relate to one another.  Expressions of love can come in various forms, and I found it so interesting to learn about the ways we can show our love to one another.  Not only was I able to better understand my love language, but I also gained insight into my boyfriend's love language as well as new ways to fill his \\"love tank.\\"  This book has shed light on so many ways we can love, and as a result my relationship is better than ever!<br /><br />If this book appeals to you, I highly recommend a book by Ariel and Shya Kane entitled, [[ASIN:1888043024 How to Have A Match Made in Heaven: A Transformational Approach to Dating, Relating, and Marriage]]. Like Chapman, the authors present ways of relating, both with your partner and with yourself, that can have a profound impact on your  relationship and overall well-being.  The principles in How to Have a Match Made in Heaven have really allowed my relationship with my boyfriend to blossom, and The Five Love Languages has invigorated our partnership in many meaningful ways.  I highly recommend you read both books!
B0034G4P80|4.0|Good movie. The Thor character is good and I love all the scenes in his world and the ice world.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Interesting, compelling and historical..makes me want to come back to it night after night.  A very good read..exciting but long list of characters and possibly a bit difficult to keep track.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I would like it a little more if you had levels of expertise instead of just the one level. I think that it would have made it more challenging.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great series! Can't wait for the other movies to come out. Ending was a little unexpected but overall very good
B007SGM084|5.0|Great great great book!! All I can say!! Really really really enjoyed it. Have recommened to several friends and they loved it too. Several friends have read it as well and they loved it too!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is a Christmas classic and my son and I watch it together every year for the past 12 years and now he and his son are watching it.  It is a great change of pace during the very busy holiday times.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|We love it. Hours of entertainment for the whole family. We all fight over turns on my husband's kindle fire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book really got me back to Sci-Fi as genre! From little bit slower start to hypersonic speed in 500 pages.<br /><br />If you ever liked Sci-Fi, you MUST read this!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I like the book the series ended great. I would still recommend to teens and up. I would not let younger kids read it.
B00447G29S|5.0|We love Polar Express, and now we have it in 3D it's even better. the grand kids are going to love it
0321525655|3.0|There are a lot of ideas and printing about this topic, and therefore competition in the field. Very helpful anyway
0600006042|4.0|I say it's good and not great because in this particular volume the print is rather small and the plays are arranged in the &#34;traditional&#34; sequence (&#34;traditional&#34; = the sequence found in most editions of Shakespeare) rather than chronologically which is what I personally prefer. But, it's Shakespeare. How can it not be good?
B009C7JS14|4.0|Nice. Doesn't update on weekends though. It is a nice quick reference tool. My husband doesn't have to pull up the news website now.
B002HL3PN4|5.0|We're starting the HP marathon that the Lady wanted to start. I didn't want to watch it on regular old DVD so we got the HD version of it for streaming. It was great!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked the book. It is written great. Simple. It is also kinda sad I think. I would recommend this book series to teens and young adults.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This is a typical Bosch story with perhaps less action than most of Connelly's books.  I would never miss a Connelly book; however, this is not one of his most intriguing stories.
0596522347|4.0|I make a lot of presentations and therefore it was very useful for my work and sorroundings. Really liked it
B0076DCT2G|5.0|One of DeMille's, make sure you have time when you start reading because,you don't want to stop. Also make sure your Kindle is charged.
B004SBX112|5.0|Hours of fun without the constant interruption of ads. Our family plays this all the time. It is fun to switch themes.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If I could give this movie 20 stars I would.  Absolutely loved it.  Very funny, and I was so surprised by Anna Kendrick's singing talent.  Rebel is amazing.  Great movie.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Yay  wonderful book can't wait for the next book  to come out such a romance they have love love love it!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I missed this  Picoult book when it was first published several years ago--don't know how!  It is such a good read.  Her books are always engrossing and thought-provoking.  This one is no exception.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|I caught the end of a television special featuring Blackberry Smoke and this CD &#34;Whipporill&#34;. I could not get to Amazon.com fast enough to buy the CD.  Over the holidays I played it for a lot of family, friends, and associates and they all fell in love with it as well.  I am a 40 year veteran of the music industry and I know something spectacular when I hear it and this is nothing short of spectacular for this genre of music.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I love this album. Every song is very good not counting the two insrumentals and Ashes to Ashes, that song is just okay. The new singer is very good also, though maybe not as good as Khan, his voice is not as strong and lacks the deepness that Khan has or rather had. Still, if you love Kamelot like I do, you'll love this album! Definately buy it!
B0063IH60K|3.0|OK. Not as easy to navigate as I had hoped. I had trouble trying to figure out how to change from one card draw to 3. I played a little while but it wasn't addictive.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken collet has a way of bringing history to life.I also like the way he ties this book  almost seamlessly from the first novel
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite app! It is really fun to build anything that you want to it is definenetly worth 7 $
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|The book is exciting and unpredictable.  A few things<br />need a good editor.  He must have had his characters<br />&#34;shrug&#34; about 200 times.  He does not explain how<br />Jack, traveling with no suitcase, change of closes or toiletries for months, does not smell<br />like a goat and look like a homeless wino. Still, I intend to read<br />the entire series and which his technique improve.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Simple and sweet. A nice book to lose yourself in. Love the detail of emotions and thoughts of the characters.
B004BGH8ZO|5.0|This album is really very good. Every song is good. I really enjoyed it!  The only drawback to it, is Nikki's talking thoughout it, yeah I know, I realize he's telling his life story or whatever, but it gets tiresome to hear it over and over again and again. I mean this is something you're going to want to listen to for the rest of your life, right! But saying that, I can't take away from the music. It's terrific! and worth five stars!
B0058VW36U|5.0|My six year old granddaughter absolutely loves this app.  She plays it all the time.  It is the first thing that she reaches for when she comes to my house.  Of course, I can't work the thing, but she is amazing.  Hours of inexpensive fun for her!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|It was great it reinforces what the secret teaches and gives you more knowledge to have anything we want, I will read it again just like the secret, every time I read it I learn more
B005LAIIJY|4.0|We are all intimately familiar with Tarantino's bag of tricks (splicing together all of his favorite generic bits/tropes from all of his favorite genre films, juxtaposing extreme violence with humor, underscoring and amplifying everything with sly musical selections) and we have all learned how to react to what Tarantino does, so, if you're a fan, this film will satisfy you in the way that each of Tarantino's previous films have satisfied you, and if you are still uncertain about how you feel about Tarantino this one isn't going to sway you one way or the other. Everyone knows by now that Tarantino films are all about revenge and the only real question is who will be the one seeking revenge and how cool will they look while settling their score. Maybe the one surprise with Django Unchained is that Tarantino doesn't do as much icon building with Django (Jamie Foxx) as he usually does with his leads. For most of the film, Django remains the strong silent type simply doing what Dr. Schultz (Christoph Waltz) tells him to do, and he expresses himself only with strong looks of confusion (early on) or disapproval (in the latter half). But then western heroes are never talkers. They talk with their gun, and, of course, in Tarantino films, they talk with the soundtrack which is probably the most exciting thing about Django Unchained. The soundtrack is a strange mix of traditional cowboy balladry, classic Ennio Morricone theme music, classic folk (Ritchie Havens), and hard-edged hip hop (2pac). Thats how Tarantino turns Django into a legend, not with incredible acts of courage but with incredible musical selections. So its odd that Tarantino won an original screenplay Golden Globe for this film because this one is much less dialogue-driven than any of his previous films. Since all of the characters are generic types (by design) and since they all hold generic attitudes (by design), there is not a lot of need for words in this film, so the memorable bits are not really the verbal exchanges between characters but the musical interludes that place the central character on a plane, a level of intensity, of righteousness, that no one else has access to. The most fitting award for a film like this would be soundtrack or sound design or mix tape award. Its the soundtrack more than the stars that breathes life into the genre. Its the soundtrack that makes it all seem both old and new, both corny and cool, both iconographic and iconoclastic at the same time. I think what we ultimately have here is a cool exploitation picture that examines the mechanisms of cool. And thats pretty cool. The thing that I most appreciate about Tarantino is that you can tell he has a great time making his films and as you watch his films you can't help but smile at how much fun you are having watching them.bal exchanges between characters but the musical interludes that place the central character on a plane, a level of intensity, of righteousness, that no one else has access to.

B0062NAX1U|2.0|I enjoyed this video for values contained in the plot--for one man's change of attitude toward his family when a child dies and his committment to be a better father--how this change affected his friends and how they made changes in their own lives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is such an easy way to catch up on favorite shows.  It downloaded fairly quickly and was easy to manage.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I am addicted to it. Play it on my Kindle...what a lot of fun. A must have for game playing
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the drama and the time period of this series! The buildings and the clothes are also quite beautiful.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Amaxing DVD! The Blu-ray quality is amazing.  We were able to order the Blu-ray, soundtrack, and an additional item for the same price we would have paid elsewhere.  Totally worth it! If you want to experience it on stage but can't go see it live, this is a wonderful alternative!
B0007TKH66|5.0|I am a trekke fan and it is awesome to have this season in my collection and i am thrilled.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|i like this game so far the gravity pull from the planets add a new twist on how you think
B009NXV2RK|5.0|So far it is a good read. Hopefully I can finish it soon. so so so so so so so
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This was another one of Nicholas amazing books. The talent he has is more then words can express. What a wonderful story from beginning to end. This story touched my heart. Very well written.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Could not put it down! Flynn paints images you won't soon forget. Loved this book and this author.  Have also read Gone Girl (loved it) and her other novel Sharp Objects is now on my Kindle.
B005LAII1C|3.0|Blu ray disk was good. I was surprise by the movie.  I was expecting more comedy.  Definitely not for kids...
B0002V7O3S|5.0|This is a great Syfy  movie and a true story I enjoy the finding out what happened.  I would tell people about this story.
B002MW50KO|4.0|This record is not the best thing he's ever done by any means, but I still enjoy listening to it during the Christmas season.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This movie had some funny parts, but just the same thing over and over and it was very predictable. I'm glad I just rented.
B000053VJI|5.0|What an amazing talent!  Juan Luis pleases with the sheer romantic poety of his verses.  His songs are so romantic or whimsical.  It's a must have in your collection!
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Good blu ray product.  Needed the disk to complete the collection.  Movie was definitely a little different than the rest of the storyline.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|It takes a new look at the old series that I did see growing up.  Johnny Depp is great at this story line.. I do think it could have went in a better direction so the story could have contiued beyond this first movie...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Tried another one before I found this one and promply deleted that one. This calculator is great! Easy to use and I like being able to see my calculations as I go.
0316227706|5.0|The photos in this book will makes you smile! When I am in a mood I get this out and there I am smiling!
B000VZYPB4|5.0|Was down sick in bed, feeling low. Watched the whole season, back to back. Laughter is indeed the best medicine!Great ensemble cast. Looking forward to the next 5 seasons.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Excellent way to bring in the new character into the sequel.  The movie was  very well directed and the actors played a great role.  Great blu ray!
B002ZG999U|5.0|It shows that your never to old and these guys are awesome to watch and enjoy,  And to see a group of old actors working together  is neat to see and I would recomend this movie to all....
B0031YJFCQ|2.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />TOO MANY CHARACTERS.  JUMPS AROUND ALOT.  NAMES IMPOSSIBLE TO REMEMBER.  BETTER MOVIE THAN BOOK.
B006TMMSLC|5.0|Not Harryhausen's best but it has a certain charm.  Good score.  James Franciscus is very good as Tuck Kirby.  The animation is up to Harryhausen's high standards except for the constantly changing color of Gwangi.  The ending in the blazing cathedral<br />is excellent.
0765325950|5.0|First off, I am sickened by the chumps on here giving such an amazing book 1 star because they couldn't get it on their precious Kindle. You have to be kidding me. I started reading this series in 1995, and whereas I thought I just wanted him to finish it, I learned after reading it that I wasn't ready for it to end. I've always thought it was cheesy when people say they \\"grew up\\" with the characters and became more emotionally attached because of it. I can say now that it definitely happened to me with this book. I am glad that when I started the series it wouldn't be finished for over a decade and that I didn't go back and reread any of them; finishing this book really was an emotional and memorable experience. Not everything went 100% the way I wanted it to, but Sanderson did a great job finishing this epic series. Not only are books like this MEANT for hardcover, rating a book based on anything other than its content is reprehensible.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie is one that the entire family watches (a lot) and enjoys.  We like it because it is something a little different from other cartoons that are out.  The main character inspires us all to be BRAVE!
B002436WJE|5.0|Very action packed and Love Liam in this movie.  If you have a child this will make you want to take on anything to save them....
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I like Tina Fey's work, so this was a great read. It helps that she's hilarious so I highly recommend this book . :)
B004FEFS5E|5.0|I was completely new at DSLR photography, after reading this book, I was comfortable with shooting my camera in manual mode.  The book was written in very simple and understandable terms.  It gave great examples of photographs with the effects show proper and improper exposure and how to ensure you do it correctly every time.  This book assumes that flash is not used.  While it does explain how ISO affects shutter time and aperture, I would have preferred it give more detail on the benefits and detriments of using different ISO's.  Overall an awesome book that exceeded my expections and one I will go back to time and time again as I get my reminders of producing excellent photographs.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I especially loved this book because I am not only a neurological patient but someone who has been so blessed to have traveled to heavenly realms without really knowing why.  But I found that I had experienced many of it's rich wonders like Dr. Alexander.  I thank God for his miracle and wish to God he was my neurologist at present. AWESOME book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All 3 of my girls play this game on a daily basis.  My 4 year old even plays it and actually can do better than her two older sisters.  They have shown it to many of their friends and they too are addicted to it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was wonderfully written and a great read.  It does justice for the Percy Jackson series, anybody who wants to read a great book read this one.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|yeah this game is so bang that its worth the buck<br />oh wait its free never mind fhfhrhhf fhfhd dfhf
B007TNS6JI|5.0|this game is amazing!! I love it. I cant seem to put it down. also if their is anyone looking for a friend on multiplayer please add me lol. :)
B008FYZIVY|4.0|We hadn't watched any of Downton Abbey.  Just started it and even my redneck husband is intrigued!  Now we have a lot to catch up on.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The entire family enjoys this movie.  This is one that we watch over and over again.  You can't beat Dr. Seuss!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book was told by a friend not to bother with the second and third books after the first book, they were wrong!
044024367X|3.0|I heard great things about Jack Reacher. Even reading online the synopsis of some of the books, Reacher was intriguing in his loner aspect. An outlaw, not to be a criminal, but to live his life free. I know I've dreamed many times of being able to be the big silent guy who lays down the law when the law won't leave him be.<br /><br />Spoiler: I understand that some may think the End Times preacher/bad guy could possibly be a character to show that not all Christians are like this, but the book lays no ground work for such separation as Reacher relentlessly mocks the preacher AND the Bible; he calls the preacher an atheist for not believing in Zues and other false gods; he includes a young Anglican preacher to portray a modern day hip brand of religion, who also condemns his own Bible for its fallacies.<br /><br />In many instances, even repetitively, Child uses phrases and symbology that you hear in the Bible (\\"the right does not know what the left hand is doing\\", \\"camel through the eye of a needle\\", etc). I thought there would be redemption by the end of the book for Reacher/Child's disdain, but I read no other view points but that of mockery. Most of his barbs and jabs were cliche of one who heard things about Christianity and the Bible, not one who has experienced either.<br /><br />I'll pick up a second Reacher novel, to get that mysterious, hard-hitting, outlaw detective that I've heard so much about. I'll even enjoy a man who questions God's motives and timing, as we all do under His own pressing. I hope the religion class is over though.
B003GK2216|5.0|Excellent story telling with an easy flow connecting every dot. Such a pleasure to read a well written book. Highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good long read.
B006H5120E|5.0|TITANIC was the first major blockbuster that I have ever seen in the theaters at the age of seven or eight. TITANIC was one of those films that gave me a better understanding of life and death at a young age and it's one of those films to treasure at any age. On Blu-Ray you can certainly witness the beauty of TITANIC in the way you were meant to see it. I almost had to hold back tears when I saw the scene of Jack and Rose on the bow of the ship where Rose goes \\"I'm flying,\\" and then you see the amazing shot of the ship turning. Those were one of the experiences that I'll never forget from watching this film on blu-ray. Blu-Ray captures those moments in a way that you were meant to see it and it makes you feel like you're really there. I think the blu-ray version of TITANIC captures the experience of seeing the movie in the way audiences were meant to see it in 1997 when it was first released and I think this blu-ray version will stand the test of time for as long as blu-ray movies continue to be released. It'a a whole new way of seeing the film in a whole new way.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is probably one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  If you enjoy family guy, you will love this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger games was a good science fiction read. book kept your intrest and was a fun escape from reality. A good read.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|My husband loves this combo pack as well as all it's extra features. I am happy that he is happy,
B003N3FVQE|5.0|I watched this series previously and enjoyed it so much I wanted to own the DVDs. My parents purchased them for me Christmas.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey a hit for the 21st century! The challenges of an English Lord, his family and their servants unfold as they face constant changes brought about by the dawning of the 20th century! Automobiles replace horse drawn carriages, buffet stye cabaret nights replace formal dining, and class lines blur and reform as the inhabitants live their lives each day at the manor house. But human nature never changes, and the politics of  life 'below stairs' and sibling rivalries above continue apace. It is a story to make you appreciate the difficulty of trying to be a good man or woman in any situation. The actors are amazing, the writing on target for the period with a few nods to modern slang, and as always the locations and sets bring the place alive. Great work once again, Mr. Fellowes and crew!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I love this album- \\"Somebody I used to know\\" is a song that I can listen to over and over again......... the other songs are great as well. Good stuff!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|American Sniper by Chris Kyle is a great read about a once looked down job with in the US military. Now we see the training & effectiveness in which 1 sniper can save the lives of so many US soliders.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|watched it several times, really good very funny, some parts a lil inappropriate for smaller children but good movies. thanks
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander is a respected professional and highly educated.  His book gives a lot of validity that there is a God and a afterlife.<br />An easy read!
B004GCC6IM|5.0|The classic Mastering the Art of French Cooking was a book I ordered for my sister, heir to the title of 'World's Greatest Chef' from our award winning Mom, Sue! {When award winning New Orleans chefs have followed your mother around the farmer's market and asked the vendors what she was ordering her ingredients for... you know that is no exaggeration!} The condition was as promised. The cover was in good shape, as described. And I know from meals cooked with those recipes that we have since eaten that the professional advice within has not lost any of its power. I highly recommend making a book purchase from Amazon, based on this positive experience.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I thought the movie was good, I would recommend for childeren 9+ in my opinion. Must see for daughters and there moms.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|The Harry Potter movie collection is the complete movie series, all in a small single case. No bells or whistles, just the movies. A great, affordable gift for my kids.
0446554995|5.0|WIthout giving too much away, this book was a fitting end to the &#34;Helen&#34; Trilogy.  I am looking forward to Preston and Child's next novel (that they say is written already!)...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am currently reading book 2 so I cannot comment on the trilogy yet but it definitely is a page turner!
B0095R64AO|1.0|There were some laugh out loud moments, but overall a very boring movie.  Sorry Jason, not your best work.  Not your best work at all.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Keeps you on your toes guessing till the end. Can't wait to see what the third book has in store.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the most well written book I have ever read describing the angst that a child goes through when he/.she is the odd man out. The technique of telling Auggie's story from different points of viiew forces the reader to consider- &#34;Have I ever been guilty of hurting someone like this?&#34;  Auggie is very witty, self deprecating, and charming. Within minutes the reader is cheering for him to succeed and excel.  I believe that this book has the ability to transform the reader's reaction to and interaction with those who are diifferent from themselves. It is a life changing book.
B006O6F932|2.0|Not worth the money . Have it a few weeks and things already started breaking and when you need to fold the school up there is no place to store contents that come with.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|I like the pdf reader except that when I have it in larger format it switches back to a smaller format without prompting and while on same page.  I do like that fact that I can highlight and underline at my leisure.  I would however, like it if I could access 2 files at the same time so I could reference one with the other when necessary.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|Keanu Reeves plays a fresh from the academy FBI agent who goes under cover as a surfer to find a bank robbing group who calls themselves the ex-presidents, action ensues. The movie never takes it's self too seriously though, so as long as you don't either, it's enjoyable. This was after Keanu's Bill and Ted days but before the Speed and Matrix days. Since Keanu already sort of talks with a surfer accent people who are turned off by this normally might not mind. Patrick Swayze is the cool head surfer/ spiritual leader, Lori Petty is great as the love interest, and Gary Busey is great as crazy Gary Busey. Style wise, I would put it on par with Speed for action, plot, and corny/awesome one liners. If you liked Speed for any reason other than just Sandra Bulock, then you may like Point Break as well.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|Loved this book. I chose five stars as I found no fault in it. If  I had the opportunity to change anything I wouldn't.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone . Overall brilliant book a must read!
B00942Y94I|5.0|Best one yet. I haven't seen Twilight Breaking Dawn &#34;Part 2&#34; yet but so far Eclipse is my favorite!!!! Great action, wonderful story, beautifully done special effects. A+ from me and my daughter.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|good pace through the movie<br />good tangent and (supposed) insight into our government and the dark secrets that could be out there...LOL
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's awesome because it's Star Wars and you get to smash storm troopers!!  So says my seven year old son!
B000M53GM2|4.0|Remington Steele was just before my tv watching time so I knew Pierce Brosnan as Bond first. This is an excellent kick start to the franchise that had not produced a movie in nearly a decade. While no one will live up to the original standard set by Sean Connery, I enjoy Brosnan's portrayal more than most bonds before him and since. The action is great including a car and tank chase scene. Silly innuendoes worked in as women characters' names are still there. And i always love the opening sequence before the opening credits. This movie brought bond into the nineties when that phrase was still contemporary.
B0063GORYU|4.0|A fun game. Easy to learn. Liked the hint and undo move option. Size is small compared to play on a computer screen.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out! If it's anything like the book it will be absolutely amazing!!!!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I bought this to use on my Acer tablet to be able to read and download e books. Great app.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really good.  Didn't really like making her pregnant, he didn't deserve that.  Could have ended better.  Real good book though.
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|I hadn't read any of Lee Child books before but will definately purchase to read them in near future a enjoyable read
B009O07NDY|5.0|Went beyond my expectations. A classic. I'm sure to listen to this over and over as I remember scenes from the movie.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|We've always loved Transformers, so we had to get this item to complete our collection.  We will buy any new ones that come out!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|Husband had fun and thought it was a pretty cool game.  My lil boy cant really play.  It is too difficult for him
0316017930|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read from a practical standpoint.  Very motivating and helped me really see the &#34;big picture&#34; of hard work, keeping my eyes peeled for opportunities, and allows me to view success just a bit differently than I had in the past.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I just love ice so I thought it was just an awesome game . It just a great interacted game .
B0090XLDKY|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my sisters! We have themed &#34;Christmas&#34;. Favorite movie, favorite movie snack, favorite movie drink. This was her favorite movie! She loved it!!
B009MO57H6|5.0|Hard to rate this since it's my son's favorite Franchise.  He loves all the movies and watches them over and over.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|Great book with an engaging storyline just too short. I read this whole book in 45 minutes. But otherwise great book.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Haller gets my vote for lawyer of the year! I'd like to go to LA just to see some of the places he talks about in the book. It all seems so realistic.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I love the way this book is actually written out. And its really easy to skim through, the words in this dictionary has been broken down from one definition too the next!.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|It's a fun game, but how do you see how many bombs you have and any many coins you have and how you get more.  Do they all require money?  Also, how do you get more colors...maybe there should be a help button for questions like this that's easy to locate while playing the game.
B000FIMG68|5.0|If you're a fan of Lost, you should have this in your collection.  My son has the whole collection and likes to watch it over and over.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I loved this book very entertaining and attention grabbing. I recommend this book to teenagers and young adults. Great book.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This was a very in-depth and well researched work highlighting personal stories of defectors.  The author did well to place those stories in the larger context of the situation the DPRK finds itself in at this time.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|I think this bag is a great deal for the price .  Honestly, I have always been a big Tamarac fan but the last and most expensive holster bag I bought from them split on two sides in places that should have never torn.  I am a professional photographer so I really use my equipment and bags throughly and I will use this one a lot.  This material is different and feels durable enough to last a while.  They did not forget to add some pockets for things like flash cards (which have their own closures) and there are two inside the front smaller pocket but then there is a zipper pouch on both sides of the main bag too.  I would have given it five starts had it been just a bit more taylored and not as bulky.  Overall a nice holster bag you can wear over your shoulder or around  your waist like a gun belt but there it is a bit bulky.
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great movie, watched it with the kids too.  My Grandmother may have given it the best endorsement, saying &#34;every family should watch this&#34;
B0019LY5IM|5.0|All the discs played well.  My son's seen the show several times and wanted to be able to watch it over and over, so that why we got it!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book fascinated me from beginning to end.<br />Yes, is it fact or fiction?  Is it a true story?<br />I am still wondering.  I read the book first then saw<br />the moving in 3D.  Both most enjoyable
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|I really thought Amazon was more proactive in not allowing vendors to over price their items.  I did expect to pay more for it because it was so close to Christmas, but after when I was shopping found the game to be 1/2 the amount I paid for it.  I will never do this again.  This company should be banned from Amazon
B00APUYN0I|4.0|My wife picked this one.  As far as chick flicks are concerened this one was tolerable.  A few funny parts and the music was not too bad.  I imagine this is similar to a Hollywood &#34;Glee&#34; movie.  Much better than the usual sappy love storeis, but very predictable.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|There is so much Greek stuff gods and goddesses and titans and Roman God's and goddesses wow that is Asome
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Aca-Awesome movie!! Great music, talent, funny!! I think I've seen it 5 times at least! My whole family loves it!
B0026NBZDU|5.0|Early on, the writer lets you know that you are reading a riff on Oliver Twist.  The story begins in a 19th Century den of thieves that uses children as pickpockets;  and, as a young child, the heroine is spooked by Nancy's murder when she sees a play of Oliver Twist.  There are also themes of character and social class that pervade the novel, similar to those in Oliver Twist.  Fingersmiths can also be read, I think, as a feminist exploration of the choices available to 19th Century women who must rely on their limited resources.  Some of those choices leave little room for moral nicety.<br /><br />Enough faux-smarty-pants analysis.  This is a fun, sexy book with great characters and a plot that will keep you glued to the page and guessing what will happen.  If you are uncomfortable with a little innocent girl on girl sex, well this may not be the book for you.  But otherwise, go for it.  You won't be disappointed.
B000X1MCTI|5.0|The book was published in the early '70's.  It was in excellent condition just as the seller stated.  It arrived much earlier than expected (during the Christmas rush, too).  Our grandson (1 1/2 yr. who lives in Austria loves to have Grandpa read it to him via skype.
0882847953|5.0|I've tried to play by ear, but it never got me anywhere. I look forward to learning the techniques in this book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought this from the app store and it does not work on my sons android phone...I do not like it!!
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Typical MIB story line with a time travel twist.  It was much better than other movie sequels that have come out.
B008X9Z37A|2.0|This case is fine. There are not bells or whistles. I knew that going into it, but it doesn't hybernate the kindle. It doesn't fold back and work as a stand. I don't like it. My son immediately took it off and won't put it back on. It was a waste of money.
B003274QH6|5.0|This show is a must see... every season is so worth it! The entire cast is just fabulous! Order and enjoy!
B00ARAO1LC|3.0|Maybe I need to watch it again but l just didn't get the ending<br />I liked it until then. My kind of movie, but...?
B009JBZH54|2.0|I expected to be able to put the digital version of these movies on my iPad, but nope.  Warner Bros will not allow it.  In order to use the UltraViolet digital files you have to get an account with UltraViolet and with Flixter.  Then you have to use their applications to watch the movies.  If you want to watch the digital movie you have to dowload their app on every device you want to watch the movie on.  I am not going to maintain accounts on two different sites to do this and I am not going to install another application to user their digital media... its not happening.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game can be played by many ages.  Given to nephews and they played it right away and also given to 25 year old daughter.  It can be fun or competitive; I prefer the competitive.  Plan on buying my own so that they next time we play as a family; I can be better than second!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Since I too am a NDEr (1977), I find the scientific evaluation interesting.  Alexander is a brave man to take on the materialistic reductionist scientific community.  However, the experience itself demands and fortifies one for such an undertaking.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book was purchased by my child. They keep buying books on my wife's Kindle and downloading them to their iPads. It allows them to read the books from their iPads.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Quick easy read.  I enjoyed it very much. I also liked the way the book was written in letters. Check it out
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a page turner, great book, could not put it down.  Would recommend to anyone who likes, dark, mysterious novels.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I really love playing this game. The graphics are awesome, the dragons are so detailed and beautiful! There are lots of things to do and watching the dragons grow is a lot of fun. Building structures or hatching eggs can take up to 24 hours which can get a little frustrating. You can make it go faster, but only with crystals and those cost actual money. I like building different habitats and seeing what new hybrid dragon hatches out of an egg from my breeding cave.<br />I do wish that there was a way that I could add friends to the game without adding them to my Facebook account. I know that if you play Dragonvale on your iphone they have a Gamers Circle that allows you to add friends. Amazon has a Gamers Center, but you can't add friends onto the game from this. Adding friends would be a plus because not only do you get to see the cool set up of their islands and beautiful dragons, but you can also get money by clicking on party hats.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|I love these people and their music. This DVD did not disappoint me at all, it was better than I expected.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|No problems at all. I use this adaptor with my external drives and my new iMac and it is working fine.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|this app is very fluid in it's functionality, the user interface is very friendly to even those who May be New to smartphone and tablet devices. your local weather is displayed on a beautifully Sharp interface. couldn't have found a more simple way to get my weather on my tablet. highly recommend it.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|The story line is a bit disturbing, but Gillian Flynn is such a good writer you can overlook that and just get enthralled in the story.  Good pacing, characters were extremely interesting if not likeable.  I thought this was a great read, especially for Gone Girl fans.  Gillian Flynn has a great ability to tell a story.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this excellent whodunit. Miss Marple is always one step ahead of the police and me! Can hardly wait to read another!
0395645662|5.0|I know why this book was chosen for a Newberry Medal. It is extremely well-written and is thought-provoking, I found it to be almost terrifying in that, are we not careful, we might have the imagined world Lowry creates in her book as a reality for our future world. I would hope that we would guard against allowing our families, as we know them, to be taken from us. The world of Jonas is one without any true happiness and lacks love and color. I was somewhat hopeful throughout the book that Jonas, the hero of the story, and his young charge, might find a better world. I suppose the message for all is to be aware. Sameness has been tried and found wanting in the world's history. I enjoyed the book as an adult. I would not have liked it as a young teen (the intended audience) because I would have found the parallels between the attempts of Germany to create such a world during World War II, where my father and uncles fought, and the world of the Giver too harsh for my tender young heart.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Absolutely what we expected from it! A real gem in the family and personal collection!<br />Represents one of the all-time classics and we already passed a word of mouth to other friends
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I am reading this book now and having a seriously difficult time putting it down.  It's always that way for me when I pick up any novel by THE KING.  He makes the unbelievable believable and puts you directly in the middle of the story like a character that sits in the background watching everything.  He is THE MASTER STORY TELLER.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Im very impressed about this running clock .. wow really if you like practice sports and wants to know how is your heart rate and how long was the jogging this is the clock.. i bought it in december .. delivery as they said .
B00A757EFW|5.0|I LOVE this PAC-MAN game it is SO MUCH like the real deal and the controler is awesome that it works with your thumb.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This has been a great show to watch.  We went back to season 1 and watched all of them. The clothes and buidlings are so true to the time.  Everyone should watch these.
0345803485|4.0|I read a few of the reviews of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" with a sinking heart.  As a struggling writer who just self-published on Amazon.com, my book \\"Anatomy of an Infidelity\\" (Sharon Jensen), at times eerily resembles \\"Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"  My novel is about two third-year medical students--married to different people--who fall in love.  It echoes some of the eroticism of \\"Fifty...\\"<br /><br />The resemblance ends there as \\"Anatomy...\\" unfolds:  how do you keep your spouse from shooting you when he finds out you've been unfaithful?  How can you manage the stress of being a medical student when your personal life is falling apart?  The tension mounts when powder-keg emotions spill over into their daily lives at Hardin School of Medicine.<br /><br />In \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" Ms. James has narrowed her focus to very specific actions.  These are at times a bit repetitive, you can't f@#$%@# all the time, eventually you have to get out of bed and go to work.  Still, she is an accomplished writer, achieving exactly what the back cover promises:  \\"a tale that will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you forever.\\"<br /><br />Her writing appears effortless; the prose is seamless with the reader compulsively turning pages to find out what happens next.  But the real genius of the story is that she makes us like Anastasia and Christian, eccentricities and all.  The writing is also crisp and clever; I wish I'd thought of having an \\"inner goddess\\" with pom-poms to cheer my characters on.<br /><br />Over-the-top sometimes, yes, who wouldn't adore having an amply endowed, billionaire, pianist, pilot, etc. who was gorgeous and wanted only you? I couldn't help but like her characterization of weird and wounded Christian.<br /><br />Besides, all the best Romance and Gothic novels from the 17th century on have heroes and heroines who are over the top.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is effings awesome - Me and mom are hooked. I hope we don't run out of levels... buy this game.
1250006341|5.0|I loved this book! Yes, I love the series, so it's only inevitable that I love the book too.<br /><br />First, the book is beautiful! The pictures and layout of the pages are stunning and I love to simply flip through the book.<br /><br />The book is broken up into nine chapters: Family Life, Society, Change, Life in Service, Style, House & Estate, Romances, War, and Behind the Scenes. Each chapter talks about the history of that different topic as it relates to people in that time period and also a bit on how it relates to the characters. This is not a book about the actual storyline as much as it is a book about the history of that time period and how that history might fit into some of the storyline. There are quotes and interview questions from the cast members throughout the book on each of the topics. Many pictures from the series and behind the scenes information.<br /><br />I re-watched series 1-2 the past couple of weeks in preparation for series 3 beginning last weekend. After reading this book, then re-watching the series, I noticed many more things that I hadn't noticed before and could tell my husband about as he was watching it all for the first time. I feel like this book adds a lot to the story line, at least for series 1-2, and is a must read for anyone who loves the history of the time period as much as they love Downton Abbey as a series. Excellent book!
0316044695|5.0|First, Mr. Luttrell is worthy of the commendations, PERIOD.<br /><br />In addition, the support for President George W. Bush against the liberal media's assassination of his character, invaluable.<br /><br />However, four things in this book bothered me.<br /><br />1) The insertion to take out the Al Qaeda leader was flawed, and the SEALs knew it.<br />2) That lead to the exposure to the goatherders, giving away their position.<br />3) The rescue mission was flawed from get-go, and men died. Dropping on the original position? Outrageous. You cannot follow a pattern or previous path. And that many special forces in one copter? Not a good idea.<br />4) And I will leave this as a question: Should Marcus have taken out Ahmad Shah when he had him in his Mark 12 sights? After all, that was their mission. (He died, violently, eventually, so maybe a moot point.)<br /><br />Conclusion: The honor and spirit Marcus Luttrell showed in battle and other decisions gained respect from the Afghanis, specifically the Pushtan, and that was the highest level of diplomacy exhibited for the United States, and may I add the Lone Star State. Marcus Luttrell honored the United States at the highest level.
B00005Y6YB|3.0|The reason I only gave this 3 stars is because there was alot of scenes edited out of this copy!  I would rerind to rewatch thinking I missed the parts I was looking for but those scenes were not there!  I first saw this on tv as a mini-series, and  there were more scenes!!  The story itself is fantastic but I will be investigating and exploring to look for a copy with no editing.  Otherwise good movie, love all the actors, excellant story!!
B008I34ZFW|3.0|It was a silly movie, that certainly met any expectation of it - actually pretty good effects for such a small budget.<br /><br />Certainly good on the carnage, story line, could have used some more T & A.<br /><br />All in all worth $20.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book when I was 9 years old an 40 years later, it still intrigued and delighted me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids love this. Have to peel them away. Ages:12.5, 10, and 8. I am ok because it is good clean fun.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|...and i love it!!! I am a writer and this app is perfect for jotting down ideas. Great app plus it has a test drive, which I took advantage of, so you can try it out first..
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Great movie for the kids.  They love the series and were so excited to get this movie along with several others.
B00942S4OY|5.0|I like it very much! It's cool, and very exciting because it comes from America, I remember, so very far: I'm in Italy.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|love this, all of the songs are great!  Usually when I buy a whole album I'll only listen to a couple of songs, but I love all of the ones on this.
B008HT4FUW|1.0|This was a gift. I was pleased that it arrived on time, but  I did not opend package and did not play the DVD.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|So glad to get this series and start watching it.  It is so intriguing and the DVD's got here quickly and was just what I expected.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great way to have the bible read to you or to read it yourself.  The voice actors have done a wonderful job.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|It came quickly...had no flaws either in the movie or it's packaging. The only problem I had<br />was submitting this review.  You put people through a lot.  Just hitting five stars should<br />satisfy you.
1419705849|5.0|He loved everything about this book! I gave him this book as a present at Christmas and he was pleasantly surprised as he loves reading all of these books and going to see these movies. He has already completed the book and is ready for another one!
0634022296|5.0|This is a fantastic book to own. It's full of songs that are simple enough to learn very quickly and play around a campfire and it's small enough to fit into a gig bag. I've even taken this to parties and sight-read and sang along to songs that I had never tried to play before. This definitely exceeded my expectations. It's a simple yet very handy book.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|My kids loved getting the rest of the series and were so excited to watch it.  Exactly what I expected.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was simply amazing. It was a great buy. I loved the way the story was told and just how realistic it was. There were so many shocking/surprise moments.  I fell in love with Sky's character, overall I read this book straight through, I couldn't put it down.
1568363931|4.0|I found the American recipes to be really unappealing, but the Japanese ones were easy, fast, healthy, and fun. This book is not about how to make your bento box cute, it is about how to feed yourself a healthy lunch in a traditional manner.<br /><br />Sadly there isn't a lot of huge variety in here (it's a short book), so you'll probably want to get another book before you get sick of the (completely excellent) instant pickles.
B0050N8N0Q|5.0|Excellent. Great uplifting music with a groovy beat. Missing you, waste, and I would do anything for you are my faves.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I loved the game layout.  I don't like how the ads are so overpowering, making it difficult to get back to the game.  I've had to exit the game and go back in order to get out of the ads.  If the ads were just small banners at the bottom or the top of the screen, I could live with it.  I got sick of the ads taking over my screen after the couple of times I tried the game, so I uninstalled it.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|The item arrived sooner that it was expected. Excellent service and price. This is an old movie not available in regular stores.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|The Time Keeper really made me take a second look at my time and the ways I choose to spend it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I think Tina Fey's style is very sarcastic and funny. If you love her show, you will understand her humor. Even if you don't it is still a great funny read.
B0036UO56G|1.0|I thought I was buying the album and not the download, I have tried in vain multiple times to reach someone , anyone to correct MY error. But Amazon is impossible to get on the phone . Hopefully someone will contact me  now.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book is a page turner. Author did a great job of keeping the reader informed of when it was present day vs. flash back. Love books that you can't figure out the ending until the last chapter!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute fun quick read! Would recommend to anyone looking for something quick and cute. Glad I read this book and it was free.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Fun but not as cool as I thought. More for playing around on creative mod. Mobs are cool and creative.
B0063IH60K|4.0|One of my favorite card games !!  Can play on kindle even when traveling.  Might even win someday, I hope...
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Read this based on the other reviews from Amazon readers.  This is a great book, very compelling. WHile it would help to know something about the great mythological religions of the past, no knowledge is necessary to find this book intricate and satisfying.
B00705GEO4|5.0|Carolus Rex is Sabaton's strongest release to date, and that does not take anything away from their previous releases that are all very good albums.  Carolus Rex, however, is a head above the rest.  As a concept album it compares well to other similarly themed releases from groups like Virgin Steele (The House of Atreus) or Blind Guardian (Nightfall in Middle Earth).  The well written lyrics are available in both English and Swedish (and sung in both languages) and weave a well told narrative about the Swedish Empire in the decades before and during the reign of King Karl (Carolus Rex).  As is usual for their albums the songs bring a mix of emotions about war from sadness to patriotism.  One thing to remember when listening to their music is that they try to write from the perspective of the people being written about, not just from the victors point of view.  This sometimes leads to songs that are misunderstood as supporting that viewpoint.<br /><br />Check out their other albums.  Primo Victoria, Art of War, Coat of Arms, Attero Dominatus, and Metalizer are the order in which I find their albums from best to good.  See them live if you can, the energy they put into even the smallest venues is astounding!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie was great. Rented for my teen daughter and was pleasently surprised at the comedy in this movie.<br />Only reason giving 4 stars instead of 5 is the language and sexual innuendos. Not appropriate in my opinion for 16 and under. My daughter is 12 ....needless to say, not a good idea.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Love this movie. Fun, light. Adventurous. I had bought before but not watched it. I saw it 4 times this go round.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|A great book and a true classic. I would recommend it to beginner book lovers.  And teens with good vocabulary
B007GCY8FS|5.0|That being said, the movie was better then I thought.  However, in this novel, Lee Child has expanded on the theme of the last good man roaming the nation.  Like Lot he seems to be constantly searching for other good men and women.  As usual he finds more good women then he does good men. The concept of the plot was incredibly inventive.  Good to see that fame hasne to his head!
0425252868|5.0|My husband couldn't put it down. He's a WWII buff and he said it gave him a whole different view of the Germans and airmen on both sides.
0061997811|5.0|THIS IS DEFINITELY A COLLECTIBLE ITEM.<br />I LOVE THE BOOK IDEA.<br />VERY ATTRACTIVE.<br />AMAZING CONCEPT TO PROMOTE AND SELL THE ITEMS.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I rented this movie to see what it was like after reading many of the reviews here.  I think what I am going to do from now on is NOT read those reviews longer than one paragraph because in my opinion, the long reviewers get extremely detailed and even somewhat anal in their descriptions.  This is a MOVIE  This is not a documentary, nor was it conceived to adhere to anyone's standards except for the writer/screenwriter.  If you don't like it, fine.  If you like it, please like it for it's entertainment value, not for how it adheres to someones script as to how it should be.  That's hogwash.  I thought it was an excellent movie, hence 5 stars.  I base this review on it's ability to keep me entertained.  My feelings may or may not be like yours, but that's why we live in a free society.  I rented it from REDBOX for a buck and a half, and it was worth that.  I also plan on buying it as it would be a valuable addition to my collection.
B005COO1X6|3.0|No milestone for the King.  Is the well going dry?<br />Why do I have to use so many words for this review?
