B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Slick little item.  For $35 you can't complain much.  It's a little deceiving the way it's marketed.  It makes it look like it'll just plug and play in the HDMI port, like a USB stick, but it does have to plug into a power source to function so make sure you have another outlet handy nearby.  There is a little delay on the Chrome browser to Chromecast but the Netflix and YouTube player is seamless.  At the office, everyone on the network using Chrome (even on the iPads), automatically saw the cast icon so it was instant for anyone to cast without having to setup any machines. It would be great if they add Amazon Prime or Hulu Plus to the player capabilities.  We'll see.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I truly loved this book! After connecting with the characters for so long, my emotions were greatly affected. There was triumph and devastating lose but at the end, everything seemed just as it should be. Excellent read!
B001N44BVQ|4.0|Cold War over since 1990. Behind the Iron Curtain scenarios out of date. There is no more Iron Curtain (so labelled first by Winston Churchill in 1946). This is Arab Terrorism vs. the CIA and its Arab allies and enemies. Nobody is to be trusted. Not only hidden political sympathies but also personal ambition can  turn an apparent friend into an enemy, and enemy to friend. This is one fine picture of the many that are coming off the assembly line to fit the new circumstances, circumstances which can never fully be understood by those involved with them much less the casual onlooker. I don't have anything resembling an understanding of the multiple political, religious, social, economic revolutions rocking the Muslim world, a vast territory stretching from the shores of Spain (once under Moorish domination) to the islands of Indonesia. So I can enjoy, as I did this movie, this Entertainment (in Graham Greene's word) without trying to judge how close it comes to any reality. It possesses a fiction's reality, one that can be accepted for the duration of the movie, and that is all that matters. Aside from a tight script and exotic (though not romantic) settings,  it does have budding love which serves to create the coda for the film. I probably have seen the two stars in a few things but have no memory of what they were;  here, they contribute an admirable quality to the proceedings. Possibly, Crowe overdoes his role of the cynical \\"Chief\\" under whom Agent DiCaprio serves. I think, however, it was what the film's creators wanted to say with that role. Supporting players were quite good, with the young woman playing DiCaprio's friend conveying an air of experienced innocence which was fitting to the role.<br />Action and drama fans should take to the movie, the squeamish will only have a few minutes of brutality, for the rest, it is the Old Spy Game. If you like that type of film, you should like this one. (As a footnote, one hopes that we do not, once more, fall into thetrap of suspecting all Muslims or Arabs living in the West of nefarious behavior or support of it.)
B00B5P37IG|3.0|Have not used it a lot yet, it on a table I don't use much, maybe in the future I will use it more.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I never played a game like this turns out it is more fun than I thought it would be.  The other reviews were very helpful.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I chose that rating because it is a great well plotted movie loved the twist never saw that coming,  action from beginning to end.  I love all the star trek movies and it doesn't  hurt that they got  an all star cast whom by the way all did a great job.  A must see!
0345440757|5.0|Very helpful! In depth and easy to understand. Helped pinpoint problems and get us back on track. Thank you so much!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I rated it wiyh a 5 star because it a grear cd by JT he has really grown in his years and matured.  He can sing, dance, rap, etc., that's an entertainer and If you see the BET Awards he gave a performamce of a life time it was 20 min of pure showmanship, it was as if no one else was there  so if you haven' t seen it I urge you to see it you will enjoy.<br /><br />Would recommend
B00F91RYL8|4.0|If you like zombie/action flicks this was a really fun movie. Fast moving zombies are much scarier than slow moving ones.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|First of all, I have to admit that it was really difficult for me at first to read this book. Just the very premise, and the very opening, were truly difficult to swallow. A brilliantly harsh opening. But just as the characters are going through those difficult early moments, and just as it seems so very, incredibly hard to go on under those circumstances, the life of the people in the silo drags you in and you very quickly feel part of their environment, and just as quickly you can´t help it but wonder what´s really going on. This is a book which finds the perfect balance between an intriguing, dark premise, lovable complex characters and unexpected plot twists. You will surely hear the words &#34;post-apocalyptic dystopia&#34; associated with this book, but such a definition doesn´t even start scratching the surface of the story.<br />Now, on to Shift!
B003VPWX6K|3.0|Nothing like the movie but enjoyable if you take your time.  It was thought provoking with a lesson or two that we can take to heart.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was beautifully and artistically done. Great story line and great ending. Can't wait till the next one comes out. I recommend seeing this for anyone who has not and even buying. It is worth seeing.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I wouldn't want a phone without this alarm clock on it. Makes up for my human errors like when I have the sound turned off or when I accidentally turn off my first alarm while I'm asleep &amp; grabbing the phone. When the sound is off on my phone the alarm still comes on. I can set it several ways. I have different tones for each alarm.  I use the stop watch to time my breaks at work. The standard alarm clocks can't do what this one does. More options to personalize it from the sounds to how you tell it to snooze, a shake, a button, a screen tap, a code. wether it starts loud or quiet. You can set it to your particular needs to make sure you're up and going on time.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This is a great suspensful movie and very good acting. I recommend this to anyone. I have seen it a few times how and love watching it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its so much fun to play. it doesn't make you pay too much. and the graphics are awesome. just keepsbgetting better and better
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie is full of suspense, funny moments, action, and great story and great acting. Love the series, and Tom Cruise and the rest of the cast do a great job of pulling off another good movie in the series. Love watching this.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|As a self proclaimed music \\"maven\\" over the past 40 years or so, I am ashamed to admit that I never realized what a classic album this was until recently. It contains 2 iconic songs of modern music in Bridge Over Troubled Water and The Boxer. It includes 3 other well known tracks in Cecilia, El Condor Pasa and Keep the Customer Satisfied. As well as one of Simon's most underrated songs in So Long Frank Lloyd Wright and one of his greatest songs, The Only Living Boy In New York. The album itself is simply an embarrassment of riches. To look back and realize that this was their final studio album is simply amazing and it really showcases Paul Simon's genius as a songwriter.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun  and challenging. options allow for custom configuration play with rules you like. Saves best score.<br />adds are limited and reasonable.
B000VOORJK|1.0|The book was very old and it came apart. Got a bad deal on this one. It doesn't desire a star, but I have to give it at least 1 not my choice. Hands down a zero.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I've never understood the up-and-then-down popularity of M. Night Shyamalan.  I think he's still an extremely talented film maker.  This is a true Sci-fi epic, slow at times, predictable if you're an avid watcher of the genre; but in no way as bad as a lot of people have stated.  I think the father and Son bond demonstrated in this movie is one of the strongest I've ever seen.  In addition, there is a basic theme in this movie about the choice associated with experiencing fear in life; we choose to interpret life's events and then we create fear in our minds about it.  The actual danger present needs to be dealt with but the fear connected to it is our personal choice.  I can't say enough how powerful this message is.  So, give it a shot it might surprise you if you watch with your eyes open!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|We are having a hard time living without all the walking dead right now. Cannot wait to start watching again!!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Where to begin...disapointing. We waited forever to get something very typical...that STILL doesn't end!?! We loved this series because it completely outdid FIFTY as Day is a MUCH better writer and clearly less narcissistic than EL James.  Sure, Sylvia never disappoints in the sizzle dept but I can't get into these pathetic women who get walked on. I try to take it for what it is...not realistic and a bit fantasy-like but just felt like this one KEPT reaching.  Probably one &#34;typical happy ending&#34; I won't be reading anytime soon.
B000001ESP|5.0|So why not have their CDs.  I don't know what others are talking about when they say the recording remaster is not good.  I think this sounds great.  I've had some CDs that the remastering of the CD was really bad and you couldn't enjoy the music but this one is fine.
B00F2362IE|2.0|my son loves the game but it takes like 2 minutes just to load.  and seems to be crashing and freezing a lot.  waste of $3.99
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Very few series hold my interest past the first or second book. The Parasol Protectorate, however, kept me riveted til the end. It's an amazing set of books, and one that I will be reading again and again. Bravo Gail Carriger!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This is a hilarious book with some hardship and mysteries but, everything works out in the end. I love Diary of a Wimpy Kid!!!!
0670026603|5.0|This exceptional book gets into the head of someone once fully capable and now needing 24/7 caregiving ... and those who love them and are doing what they believe is best for them.  Offers a different perspective that is honest and not often spoken (especially so well and compelling).  This is the best book I've read this year! Tough subject, well done!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|the force is strong with this one if you want a good game do not get this on the other hand if you want a great app get it now
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|The reason I made this purchase was because I couldn't afford a fancy-smancy ELMO, but I needed something to enhance my math instruction.  It was eating up so much class time for me to write and turn and write and turn because kids either couldn't see what I was writing or misbehaved every time I turned around.  This item allows me to sit among my students and work on the same paper they have while instructing.<br /> I did read a review previous to my purchase that mentioned the joints being rather flimsy.  The joints and body are plastic and very lightweight, however, if you are careful and take good care, it should be fine.  So far, I have been very gently and cautionary with it and of course, never let my students near it.  :)<br />I also read that some had trouble with the installing, but it was a snap for me.  I installed it on a laptop that has Windows 7.  The install took, maybe 5 minutes.<br />For $95 + the 2 year warranty and free shipping, I feel like my purchase was a good one.  Also, the students love when I use it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it and so does my kids we could sit around and play this game for hours at a time.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This was a very good book, but also extremely confusing at times. It even felt as if the author confused himself at certain points. For example the protagonist gets attacked by a creature ' and has his stomach sliced open right down to the muscles, and the creature is about to dig in and have lunch'. Any way Mr Protagonist escapes this and many other amazing injuries, with no mention of severe blood leakage and is able to climb tall buildings ( rock walls) in a single bound! Not believable at times and very confusing...but I still do recommend it and will buy the next one.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book was great and it seemed like it could have been a Greek myth. Our group of hero's, fought against almost insurmountable odds, and won because they never gave up. A great end to an awesome series. I look forward to reading the next series.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I came back to write this review after seeing the price jump astronomically!  I bought 2 or 3 of these a year or so ago and at the time they were about 10 dollars.  I bought two or three because I'd bought a pair in the past but it lasted for about a year.  I have since gone through another pair that lasted about a year.  They are by far the most comfortable headphones (for me) that I've found but given that they only last a year or less there is no way I would pay 40 dollars for them!!!  The sound quality wasn't anything special for me, seemed okay.  I mainly wanted something comfortable for jogging and these fit the bill (at 10 dollars, not at 40)  It's a little misleading that there are all these great reviews for these things b/c people were probably reviewing the product based on about a 10 dollar or less price tag.  At the old price, I would have given these 4 or 5 stars.  This ridiculous price change is something I will definately keep in mind when reading and writing future reviews.  Don't buy these at this price!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book felt like you were getting to replay all your favorite role playing games with a fantastic twist - saving the world!  I highly recommend it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had MDR-V6's for over 14 years for DJ'ing purposes and set out on a misson to find a suitable replacement as I was starting to look like a hobo when playing gigs. All the pleather had almost completly worn off the headband, the earpads had been replaced 3 times, the cable going to each earpad was a lil crimped and every night I was left with black flecks all over my shirts/face .. however still working like a dream (yes they sound SOOO much better after a few hundred hours burn-in).<br /><br />So after buying (and subsequently selling) oodles of pairs of \\"modern\\" earphones I literally could not find anything sub $200 that could touch them for both studio and live work - they literally tick EVERY box, including portability and when I saw them on Amazon for $77 I just bit the bullet (again)... and my old friends return.<br /><br />.... SOME of the headphones I tested against:<br /><br />HD25 - these are a million times more comfortable for long hours, soundwise however on-par IMHO.<br />Audio Technica ATH-50's - Felt like comparing a Galaxy -S to an Iphone 4, Mid / top end was horrible.<br />Marshall Majors - In a NON-A/B test the Marshalls actually sounded Decent, and I bought a pair on a whim - A/B tested at home and sold them a week later<br />Marshsall Studio's - Sounded Nice until I did a comparison.<br />Pioneer HDJ500's - Probably the biggest TURD in the bunch, these felt like I had actual pieces of vinyl stuck to my ears and were wayyyy too big<br />TMA-1's - decent except for the size was huge on my tiny head and have quite an exaggerated bass end.<br /><br />In fact the only headphones that really shined in comparison were the Superlux 661's for $30, which almost sound identical and I probably would have bought a pair except they didn't fit my head properly and the pads felt yukkie !!<br /><br />Some people will complain about the cables being non-replacable, well in this department sony got it right, becuase the cable will never NEED to be replaced itsseriously tough and been through the wars, however I'm going to modify mine with a shorter straight cable for DJ use !<br /><br />I would go so far as to say the only headphone that I would consider using if these ever get stolen/eaten/run over by a car would be the MDR-1 which have almost exactly the same sound characteristics and are a better looking headphone - but for $230 more !!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Finding Pride is a very sweet story. Its about an abused divorcee and a great big man who loves to protect. Who wouldn't love that. As some other reviews stated, there are a lot of flaws in punctuation and use of words. However, if you look past all that and just read the book, you will love it. It has a great story line. There is some repetition that annoyed me at times, but I got the book for free so I am willing to overlook the little things. It could use an edit then be released again, in an updated version. Overall, I recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My son downloaded this without my permission but it's ok to play...kind of like playing temple run with minions running around.....
B000BISBDY|5.0|This disc has all of my favorite Cash tunes and more. I greatly enjoy this compilation and would recommend it for anyone who is trying to get into Johnny Cash for the first time. This has a lot of his essentials and the tracks range over several decades of his career, which gives you a good sense of his music as a whole.
B0087ITBPC|3.0|The only reason I watched this is because Barbra Streisand is in it, but it is not much of a movie
0385341075|5.0|This is an amazing little novel, one of the best I've read in recent years. A friend of mine recommended this one to me a few years ago, but I only got around to reading it this month. I'm sorry that it took me so long! This novel serves as both a love letter to \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, and the powerful, uplifting story of a young girl living on a remote island country torn apart by civil war. \\"Mister Pip\\" refers to the character in the Dickens novel, but it also ends up as a reference to young Matlida's eccentric yet inspiring teacher, Mr. Watts, the lone white man living in the village. The book has more than it's share of funny, lovely, and tender moments, but before its conclusion the reader is also confronted with tragic and horrific passages too. In the end, however, this book is a triumph, showcasing the magic and power of a good teacher and that of a good book, and more importantly the power to believe in yourself. Highly recommended.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this film, how could it be bad with so many great 'old' star in it, I would love it if they made a sequel
B00E6890RG|5.0|I have been listening to Haken since their full length debut and will say this album does not disappoint. Ross Jennings is at his best vocally, Griffiths and Henshall knock it out of the park on guitar, Hearne supplies a great pulse on drums, MacLean's bass lines are tasteful and Tejeida delivers some nice key work and sound design.  This is an album to sit down and experience, it does not do any justice to explicate the work track by track.  Some of my favorite tracks are Cockroach King, Falling Back to Earth and Somebody.  Every song on this album is exceptional, my favorites are based solely on my taste and lyrical content.  Check this album out!
B00914JWSW|5.0|What can I say she has the voice of an angel & I love her, I have every album she has ever made
B00AEFY08O|5.0|This movie is for all the family, part of te history, good story, everyone enjoys it. Blue ray version is good.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am a big fan of the James Bond films, especially like Daniel Craig but was sad that they killed 'M'
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Life advice and very easy to use as an every day guide whereby to live life and conduct your life.
B002361MLA|5.0|Read often and read with attention. This book is revolutionary in its simple yet powerful message. Give it a try and see what happens.
B00DZVKQGY|2.0|It's hard for me to believe that so many people rated this book so highly. Yes, the concept of a family torn apart by tragedy and learning to live again is appealing and has the potential to be inspiring. However, this book is so badly written that its appeal is lost in the struggle to continue reading, and the potential for inspiration is wasted.<br /><br />Perhaps it gets better as it goes along, but after reading 6% of it I decided it wasn't worth any more of my time. The sad part is that a competent editor could have saved this book.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Although Batman II  was the best of the three in my opinion,  this was an excellent ending to the story's.  I'd like to see a 4th movie with the same actors in it.
B00AAQWMB4|1.0|and even when I tried it was still boring. It was nothing like tetris at all. boring boring boring boring
B001HN697M|4.0|I enjoyed watching this move and have added it to my collection of Underworld DVD's.  I'd purchase a fifth Underworld story if it was ever made.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It's a little different, which I like! I haven't seen the movie to see if it did the book justice.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this move and have added it to my collection of Underworld DVD's.  I'd purchase a fifth Underworld story if it was ever made.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have watched it through twice now and also gotten my family addicted to it as well.  Even my dad and husband!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game has kept me occupied for hours while waiting for a doctor appointment or any other time I have time to kill. I recommend it to anyone. It's a great way to entertain your kids or grand kids while you are out of the house.
B004JMY312|5.0|What's not to love about Bette, Kathy and Sarah who play The Sanderson Sisters of Salem back in the days of witch trials who were all hanged for sucking the breath of life out of Emily Binks. They are brought back to modern day on Halloween night after a virgin teen lights a candle that had a spell on it and hilarity ensues. This movie is fantastic! My whole family loved it and it is suitable for children of all ages. It's our favorite movie for Halloween. They don't call Bette Midler the Divine M for nothing! I more than highly recommend this movie!!
B00699SDR8|5.0|I like how fast it arrived and how fast you can read it. I don't have any dislike yet. If you love Philosophy this one will make you think and enjoy it at the same time. All points make you think and there's no answer right or wrong just helps you create your own. Sophie is a young school girl but she is representing all thoughts you might have about life, origin, and perception of your surroundings. The philosopher is the one who puts the description in front of you to think about it. I am having a great time reading. When I have to stop all questions made on the book stay in mind for a long time trying to put all points together. Great book!
1878424777|5.0|Wonderful...really hit a home run with me!  If one really listens and follows this as closely as they can...and WANTS to become a better and more enlightened individual in our world today, they can do it!  You need to keep it around and listen to it more that once...maybe to refresh themselves on occasion!  I have become a more peaceful individual because of this CD!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|This show is a show that you watch when you want to relax and kick back.  It doesn't have detailed plot but is enjoyable.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Need more levels!! A great way to occupy my time and make me think! I highly recommend to anyone who likes to be challenged.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I definitely am enjoying the game,  &amp; . How  there are zero ho scenes! I like how all the items that need to be found are in the regular game. I mostly enjoyed grooming &amp; taking care of the horse! Feeding him, washing,  Brushing, watering &amp; changing his horse shoe! That was absolutely darling, Being I'm such an animal lover! Keep em coming, . But come on....FIVE BUCKS!!??? TOO MUCH! . I will stick with . Alawar &amp; Big Fish games, this cost too much
B000W453KQ|5.0|Nice, naustalgic with beautiful actors, music and era. The flashback style serves good the story line of a love story, ruined by misunderstanding and unccompromising positions.
0007466064|4.0|Bought this for my son and he has just started reading it but I'm sure he will enjoy it,he has enjoyed the rest of the series.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|I like this movie too much to give it less than 5 stars but I wish I hadn't purchased the unrated version. All it adds is a few moments that had been left on the cutting room floor for the original release because that's where they belonged. I recommend this movie in it's original theatrical release version.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I like reading self-help book, but I can't really get the point of the book or chapter. I stop reading after finishing experiment#1. experiment#1 keeps talking about god and jesus. I still don't know what it does, or the purpose of the experiment, until i reach the end of the chapter. Maybe it's just not my style.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this to use with a GoPro3 (you need the overpriced GoPro mini USB to 3.5mm adapter). Even though the dynamic range is not quite covering the 20Hz to 20kHz range, the quality is good and I love the long cable that allows for example to record video in front of the car while recording the audio of the exhaust.<br /><br />Only problem is the short battery life and no way of knowing when the battery died.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, it was amazing. I couldn't put it down, didn't want to either. The evil guy, that i didn't expect it, at all, i was like WTH!! Dan Bown writes beautifully!!

B005544TRQ|5.0|I am not much TV and there is a little too much skin here and there, but overall-very entertaining and well written.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Wow, i really liked this book, but i refuse to accept that end! i do, i really do, i can't wait for the movie and see if they made it justice. Highly recommended.
B001CQONKY|5.0|I would like to take the time and thank you. This set was very well priced, in awsome conditon ,and i will do bussness  you again.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|The album opens with a back-to-back set of four awesome, heavy rock songs. \\"Love Bites\\" kicks the album into high gear right from the start, and it continues through \\"Mz.Hyde\\", \\"I Miss the Misery\\" and \\"Freak Like Me\\". After that, the album gets a whole lot softer with the still enjoyable \\"Beautiful With You\\", \\"In Your Room\\" and \\"Break In\\". \\"Rock Show\\" starts picking back up the pace slow and steady, leading into another full-on heavy song, \\"Daughters of Darkness\\". \\"You Call me a Bitch Like it's a Bad Thing\\" is right up there in terms of awesomeness with the opening four. \\"American Boys\\" slows the pace down a bit again, ending off with the always enjoyable \\"Here's to Us\\", followed by the epic \\"Guest Version\\" featuring the likes of Slash, Myles Kennedy, David Draiman, Brent Smith, and more in a who's who of rock music today joining in for the final set of choruses.<br /><br />While the pacing flusters a bit mid way into the album, the songs are all enjoyable. I highly recommend this album, even if only for the heavy set of four at the beginning (and \\"You Call Me a Bitch\\" later on in the album) because they are so awesome.
B00BGI08GG|4.0|The TV series Arrow is \\"grounded\\" take on Green Arrow. As far as the Blu ray and DVD combo pack goes, it's a bit of a waste. Some people may like having both, but DVDs play on BD players too. I wish they sold Blu ray only box sets because I've got a bulky season 1 collection and 5 DVD discs I don't need.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|3 words Epic, Funny, Exciting<br />Love this game so freaking much<br />Can't stop playing<br />Love love love<br />Must buy this GAME 1 more word Legendary!!!!!
B0000DJYQQ|5.0|I have heard many of the songs on this album but did not get to hear the whole album til  20 years after it was released. Is is one of their finest albums. Definitely in top 3 for me. Check it out if you have not.

B00COCY67A|5.0|Thanks for Sony/ Legacy for finally releasing Elvis's Stax output in one compilation.  With numerous outtakes, in which Elvis is in a creative a good mood we get a &#34;fly on the wall&#34; chance to hear the songs materialize which to the closest will ever get to actually being in the room with Elvis as he is laying down tracks.  All the masters from the July and December 1973 session are here.  finally we have a title in 'Elvis At Stax' which highlight the obvious which should have been done with the original albums, highlight the fact the Elvis is recording at the legendary Stax Studio in Memphis.  the booklet is great and feature the whole story of how Elvis came to record at Stax and where his personal life was taking him at the time of these sessions.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is one of those books that brings you with the adventurer in his travels, in this case Christoper, and makes you feel like you are a part of his journy towards discovery and friendship.  I couldn't put this book down and it motivated me to run again after having not run for several years due to injury.
B003VTZTU8|5.0|Very critical analysis of the public's science perception and a funny read about pseudoscience. Great read for people that are not quite convinced of how science works.

B0049J5EWW|5.0|Started easing our 3-year old into Pixar films , beginning with Toy Story.  It was a good choice, holds the attention, and has been enjoyed a lot.  Watching it as an adult, the film has stood up well over time.  As a parent, you can make of it whatever you would like - something to keep the kids still for a while and/or something to spur a light &#34;parent talk&#34; conversation with them  once in a while about being nice, friendship, moving, taking care of your toys , etc.
B00CATSONE|1.0|Not much to this book.  Not much about Tesla at all.  I felt similar to other reviewers, seemed more like the author was promoting his self help books more than giving info on Tesla.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett does it again!  Intriguing story with personal drama encapsulated in historical context.  I wish history class had been ths engaging!  Can't wait for the next installment...
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book and could hardly put it down.  It seemed very honest and showed Cheryl's lowest of lows and celebrated her victories in a real way.  I loved reading about a real woman who suffered; made mistakes; and through her own determination and will for survival she changed the direction of her life.

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Just saying I enjoyed this book would be an understatement. I've already read the first collection and this one is just more of the same great stuff. Hoping for a third collection.
B007JZGIMS|5.0|This is one of the best players that I have ever<br />Ever used. The interface is easy to use, the equalizer is the best, and overall you get what you pay for when you use premium unlocked. I currently use a nexus 4, but for any device I would highly recommend this to you.
B00COHAUD4|4.0|This was a great movie. Scary without trying to overdo. It was very creepy and makes you jump several times. I was a bit messed up but in a good way. I'm looking forward to mama 2---I hope they don't mess it up.

B009LDD54K|5.0|Intriguing plot and subplots.  Beautiful costumes and settings.  Exceptionally good acting. Lots of nudity and sex so would suggest that  children and teens not be allowed to see it.
B00F35BV64|5.0|WOW! Very impressed....so much better than I anticipated for being a sequel especially with being a &#34;Star Trek&#34; fan. Also, WOW...... Eve!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The music and graphics were so good but the game itself was not fun.  Without directions on how to play the game it was simply guesswork.  Could have been very entertaining for my seven-year old granddaughter.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really enjoyed the way the characters all &#34;touched&#34; each other.  Anyone who enjoys 'surprises' will like this book immensely.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I'm glad my husband introduced me to Band of Brothers. Being transported to that time and experiencing the war through the eyes of the soldiers was enlightening. There was never a dull moment. I truly enjoyed it. Great cast too.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|What a tapestry of cinematic beauty. From the haunting score, to the gorgeous sylvan vistas, to the impeccable period costumes, to the cracking good story line, this is a must see for anyone animated by a good movie. As Gable said about Rhett Butler, the role of Nathaniel Poe should appear prominently in the obituary of Daniel Day Lewis. It is well nigh his artistic masterpiece. A caveat however. As has been noted in other reviews, for some reason there are many alternate versions of this film out there on DVD/Blu Ray. When I want to watch the beautiful unexpurgated version, I always go back to the widescreen VHS edition of the movie house edition. I have been distressed with other versions that mutilate dialogue or sound score.For instance: the haunting scene where Nathaniel and his Indian father and brother are running desperately through crags and forests to rescue Cora Munro and the &#34;I will find you&#34; choral and instrumental music is in the background. Other versions truncate this so badly that it has the effect of taking a chisel to the Pieta. A final comment about the picture's political correctness which castigates the war-mongering and greedy Europeans as it exalts the life of the Rousseauian Savage. These things are said by Nathaniel in a fiery Philipic against bad guy Magua. Yet elsewhere the movie shows the harsh cruelty of Indian warfare as it was historically recorded by Jesuits and others. This sort of disconnect is tolerable but the haughty polelmics become tiresome. Still, put these reservations aside and enjoy the masterpiece that is Last of the Mohicans.
B00AEKFLOQ|5.0|One of the greatest batman films made by Nolan, something tells me that there wont be any more dark knight films close to Nolan's trilogy by class of actors and story telling. Now back to this steal case book of blue ray and DVD, inside you will find three discs two of blue rays and one DVD format. Two blue rays contain a film on one disc and extra special features on the other where as DVD has film on. Case it self is looking great and feels to touch even better, I absolutely would recommend getting steal case book over regular plastic one to any dark knight fan as this one would stand out in your collection of hard copy movies for sure.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and I hope that they are making a second subway surfer. This game doesn't<br />take much skill to play but challenging enough to be fun get this AWESOME game in the app store.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Can't figure out how to play this game....have had several people try. Instructions not great. My kids got past 2 levels and then gave up.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|This book is a good read. The romance between Megan and Todd was very sweet although I felt like it happened a little. The author characters were very well written and I'm half in love with the brother Iian lol. Altogether I really enjoyed this book and plan to read more of Jill Sanders' work.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i like this game. We play each other to see who can get the fastest time. something to do when waiting at appts etc.
1451696191|5.0|I first saw the film based off this novel and I loved it and purchased this book days later. I love it just as much, if not more. However there is a much grander and deeper emotion and purpose within this novel that not only immediately connects you to the protagonist and his friends, but it takes you back to when you were in high school, surviving just as Charlie does in the novel. Another wonderful aspect of this novel is the pained unrequited love Charlie holds for Sam in the novel, which I believe everyone can understand. The main character, Charlie is both very adolescent and at times extremely prolific, which is perhaps one of the greatest allusions the book has to offer to teens in this day and age (or possibly any age), that although they (we) feel wise beyond our years, we still continue to fumble and stumble into the same pitfalls plenty of teens have fallen into throughout the ages.<br /><br />I feel I cannot say enough about this novel, but I do believe it is something anyone of any age should be able to relate to and it will cause you to reflect on your own high school life. This novel deserves to be held in high regard alongside the likes of Salinger's 'Catcher in the Rye' and Judith Guest's 'Ordinary People.' A must read.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The plot was interesting and fast paced but there was zero character development or inner working of the people and their respective thought processes, feelings, fears or motivations.<br /><br />It was fun and you are definitely rooting for the main character but overall, even though it ends well, the story is very flat.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|This is a great quality sounding cd.<br />The songs are great on this cd.<br />The Passenger music is excellent.<br />The service was great, and delivery of the cd was very fast.<br />It only took a few days to receive this cd.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great sci-fi dystopian thriller. Good characters with a good ending. Will be a movie someday. Can't wait to read Shift!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|One of the greatest thing ever invented since the caveman discovered the fire! The most inexpensive way to make an older HD tvs(like my Panasonic &#34;50 plasma) get with the program to the rest of the modern and more highly advance tv sets out there.  It plays well with my android phone and HP touchpad(with Android OS - dual boot). It took me awhile to receive this item due to Amazon running out of stock, but I  only paid $35 compare to others selling for more on their site.  Highly recommended, you'll be glad you did!
6302820448|4.0|Television reporter Bill Murray is assigned to report on the Ground Hog Day festivities, he is less than happy.  When he wakes up the next day and it is the same day all over again he is dumb-founded.  He realizes he can do whatever he wants and nothing happens.  Later he realizes he needs to figure out what is wrong and fix it.
B008CX2A2I|2.0|In principle, the product works easy and flawlessly.  Except for one issue, the bluetooth range is AWEFUL.  It skips and chops with me just sitting on my couch at the other end of the room from the device with zero items in between for interference.  I'm talking about 9-10 ft away.  The audio quality is great while it's working, but it makes the product basically pointless and useless for me.  Don't buy if you plan to walk around anywhere with your phone.  (which is the purpose of one of these devices).
B00000JGEN|4.0|Similar to [[ASIN:6304864264 Death Race 2000]] about a time in the not too distant future (NOW) when a game show (run by Richard Dawson) features people who partake in a game a la survivor to win--or die.  He faces a group of characters, meets a girl along the way. Engaging.  Commentary on society.

B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is incredibly witty and entertaining. I have only made it half way through season one so far, but I'm hooked...
B006IYG5HE|3.0|This is my first Nesbo novel, and it will likely be my last.  For me, it wasn't the time shifting between WWII and present day (well, '99-'00) that was off-putting, as others have said; it was that the storylines and characters were not compelling enough for me to want to keep reading.  Nonetheless, I kept coming back to it and finally finished, but the denouement seemed contrived, and readers were left with some unsolved threads.  This may be a Nesbo trait to get one to read the next book where those questions are resolved--I don't know, since, again, this is my first Nesbo.  I ended up liking Harry Hole, but not enough to read another one.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I found the film respectful of its lineage and the actors respectful of their predecessors. Mannerisms and cadences were nearly flawless, and the heart of the story was true to its roots. Fantastic.
0979019710|5.0|What an amazing book def a must read for those who desire change and are ready to make it. I was never an am person and now I'm up most days by 5:15 ready to rock!!!! #millionairemindset

B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|LOVED IT.  I JUST LOVE BRUNO MARS.  HIS MUSIC IS AWESOME AND I SAW HIM IN CONCERT AND HE WAS THE BOMB
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 1990's are aware of who The Smashing Pumpkins are. You have that one kid who knows songs like \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" or \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\" Unfortunately, many people are missing out on what I think is one of the best albums music has ever generated. This album just happens to be the 2 disc/Triple LP \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" This album takes you on a journey. Literally. Once you flip the album on, your mind soars out of reality and into pure space. You can see planets and the moon. The front cover and other art from the album really sums up what I mean. Take the first song \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\\" A gorgeous piano song that perfectly opens the album. I find this song to be complimentary to the next song \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\" At this point, your mind is calm and tearful, since both songs are really gripping and emotional. The next thing you know, BAM! The third track, \\"Jellybelly,\\" bursts into your ears. The song is loud but amazing at the same time. As track four \\"Zero\\" comes on, you are completely into the rock genre mood. Track 5 \\"Here is No Why\\" (probably the best song on the album,) comes on. The song is so great I can barely put it into words. The vocals and heroic guitar solo send shivers down your spine. As the next few songs come on, your musical atmosphere gets bigger and more explosive; with the exception of track 7 \\"To Forgive.\\" The fuzz of \\"Love\\" and the salt shaker/harp ballad of \\"Cupid de Locke\\" starts to slow the album down to a more digestible pace. \\"Galapogos\\" turns gorgeous rock into hope, and \\"Muzzle\\" is a song about an epiphany, giving you insight on Billy Corgan's life. \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" soars over your entire body. The song is a perfect combination of psychedelia and pure rock. The first disc closes with James Iha's (the 2nd guitarist) song \\"Take Me Down,\\" a quiet yet breathtaking performance.<br /><br />Disc 2 opens up with \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\" and \\"Bodies.\\" Two loud and dark songs with excellent guitar riffs and awesome lyrics. As \\"Thirty-Three\\" and \\"In the Arms of Sleep\\" come on, your musical pace starts to die down. The songs perfectly slow down the rate of speed that the album gives off. Both songs are dreamy and magnificent. \\"1979\\" comes on. It is a softer song with electronic influences. The song is a little faster than the previous two. Corgan perfectly pieces the three together to get your mind tempo back up. \\"Tales of a Scorched Earth\\" comes on and blows your brain out of your butt. The song definitely takes some getting used to, but after a couple of listens you can understand why the song is necessary on the album. The 7th track, \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\" comes on. It is easily the most beautiful track on the 2nd disc. The song is slow, psychedelic, loud, heroic and emotional at the same time. The soft mood carries itself into the next track \\"Stumbleine.\\" The next track, \\"XYU,\\" is a real rocker. It's loud and angry. The next track \\"We Only Come Out at Night,\\" is definitely different than the other songs on the album. It's cheery and catchy. It reminds me of a childhood singalong. \\"Beautiful\\" is a successful mix of dream pop and classic rock. \\"Lily (My One and Only,)\\" and \\"By Starlight\\" start to send the album down the goodbye path. They serve as pieces that mature the album; reminding the listener that a journey cannot last forever. \\"Farewell and Goodnight\\" closes the entire 28 song album. The song features vocals from every band member. The incorporation of several vocals is a way to say goodbye to the listener, personally.<br /><br />As you can see by reading the review, Mellon Collie is the most gorgeous piece of musical art that any artist has put out. Albums like \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Ok Computer\\" are perfect albums, but they don't take you on a journey like Mellon Collie does. If you haven't bought this album, it is a must do for any music lover looking for a ride into Pumpkinland.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game you no y because it is so awesome it even has a sideboard<br />Subway surfers is like the best game in the world
B008JFC6F0|5.0|I was a fan of the song \\"Solitude Is Bliss\\" from T.I.'s first album Innerspeaker. I didn' t get the album as I figured (wrongly) that T.I. was a 1-hit wonder. About 6 months ago I was tipped off that Lonerism was the best alt-rock record of the year so I decided to purchase it. I don't normally write reviews, but I'm a huge music fan and believe most people my age (40's) are completely lost in the 1970's classic rock scene- I mean I love Floyd and Led Zep too, but after 1000 listens it gets old. Of course the music today isn't anywhere near as fresh as that stuff was back then, but it doesn't change the fact that there are some amazing bands out there that the rock loving public has no clue about, and that's sad. To me, there has been a lot of great music over the last 20 years or so, but only 1 band, that being Radiohead, has transformed music- making 3 completely epic, yet completely different records back to back to back. Which gets me to the point of the review. Tame Impala, to me, has the best chance of being that kind of transformative band. I say that because every song they've put out so far (including the EP and B sides) is simply great. The progression from Innerspeaker which is an amalgamation of great tunes one after the other to Lonerism which flows perfectly from song 1 to 12 is the kind of progression you want in an \\"epic\\" band early in their career. Yes, Kevin Parker sounds like Lennon and the music is a psych blend of Beatles meets Floyd meets the White Stripes, but it's uplifting and dreamy. Parker's genius is to hook you constantly with melodies-for instance the 4 minute looping in \\"Keep On Lying\\" that any other band attempting something similar would have you hitting the \\"fast fwd\\" button after a minute- Parker makes you want even more after the song is over. The guitar riff at the end of \\"Music To Walk Home By\\" nails it, the tantalizing drum beat in \\"Nothing that Has Happened..\\", the amazing building burst of sounds in \\"Endors Toi\\" and the the wild psych ride of \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\", which imo is a song that rivals Radiohead's \\"Paranoid Android\\". I saw these guys live a few months ago in NYC and it was like going to a Floyd show and will see them again next month, and I can't wait to see what Mr. Parker comes up with on the next album.
B003K16P3M|5.0|It was very entertaining and very good you will not be able to put the book down it is good
078619619X|5.0|This book is a masterful mixture of hilarious pranks, fun stories, and a grand tour of the life of one of our greatest Physicists.  I greatly enjoyed listening to it.<br /><br />Feynman's way of seeing the world made for a very fun narrative, and oh the pranks and accomplishments he pulled off... Take the fact that there was a guy sneaking around the Manhattan Project breaking into safes, but he was on our side and doing it to prove they were insecure (and because it was fun).  That was Feynman.  He took a vacation by studying another field of science (biology), instead of hitting the beach.  He was a womanizer, a professor, a prankster, and a physicist.  And yet he fit all these together seamlessly into a single, coherent, brilliant person.  The contrasts make him all the more likable.<br /><br />There are some dark or sobering moments in the book as well, including: his reactions to seeing the nuclear bomb's power and imagining what might come next, his scary brush with the threat of alcoholism, trying to fix the problems with Brazil's educational system at the time, and his frustrations with people believing in bad (poorly done) and outright fake science.  These moments help balance the story's hilarity, but such moments are still rare.  Overall the book is very upbeat and funny.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I'm loving using my SamsungS3 phone with Amazon MP3 app + RunDouble's C25K app.  It's great to be able to add new songs to my training play list without having to doc to my PC; keeps my training runs fresh.<br /><br />Finally time to retire my iPod Shuffle and the original C25K podcasts.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|When I started watching this movie I thought \\"that's just great...another dragging around zombie movie\\"....but I was pleasantly surprised.  Nothing like the cheap ones...this had a story.  Brad Pitt was excellent, I forgot he was Brad Pitt.
0399255370|5.0|We read this with our 4-year-old this summer and we loved it. We had his 6 and 9-year-old cousins read it and they said, &#34;That's a really funny book!&#34; Especially fun if you like to read using different voices for the characters.<br /><br />My only question for the author -- why didn't brown crayon write a letter? Guess he/she was satisfied with coloring turkeys and tree trucks.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|I'm one of those that haven't actually played the game (and have no intention, as this type of game isn't really my cup of tea) but bought the soundtrack anyway. I watched a lets-play on YouTube and immediately fell in love with the premise of the game (I just have a thing for post-apocalyptic story lines), the way the story was told, the stunningly beautiful scenes (yeah, even in a world full of despair this game shows some surprising beauty), the very believable \\"acting\\" (movie-quality, if you ask me), and lastly the lovely soundtrack that fittingly amplified the effect of the events in the game. I'm going to point out the giraffe scene in particular, which was underscored by what is in my opinion the most beautiful theme on this CD (Vanishing Grace). That scene, together with that song, quite honestly brought a few manly tears to my eyes ;-) and certainly is by far the most memorable part of the whole game to me.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|A great app for providing a check of your local weather, and for locations to which you may be traveling.  Colorful and easy to read and understand. It's the Weather App to have!

B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I have never cared more about a protagonist in a movie. I had no idea Mark O'Brien was a real person until the end. John Hawkes was sublime, his performance was flawless & incredibly touching. Helen Hunt's best work, especially loved William Macy & Moon Bloodgood, but every single actor was equally wonderful. What a script, director, score, it was all perfect. You don't see many films these days celebrating compassion, kindness & class. It's all violence, hate, degradation of women, cynicism and vulgar humor. Thank You Ben Lewin, for making this film. One of my all-time favorites.
B004LWZW24|2.0|Wow. Where to begin. Most of the films ideas were taken from the movie Poltergeist.  A child gets lost in another world. Two bumbling ghost busters and a paranormal expert are called in. And a parent has to go after the child.  Just like the move poltergeist.  The rest of the movies ideas must have come from a teenager. It was that bad

0691126658|4.0|A great guide especially as it gives range maps on the same page as the pictures/drawings. The down side is that they use drawings and not photographs. I wound definately recommend it but I would also suggest using it with a companion guide that uses photos.

B004X6PRO6|3.0|...it got so sad half way in that I stopped reading.  I'm, 70 yrs old and don't have time for such sadness.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally a game that works on kindle fire and tablets!!!! this game is awesome it works does not freeze it works for my child I would give this game 10 stars if I could!!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Excellent show, very on the edge of your seat kinda show, keeps you wanting to see more. Thrill to watch.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Action packed, twists and turns, you don't know who to believe, it's definitely an adventure. Enjoyed the the books together-!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie brings the stage show to life. unfortunately not all the actors are accomplished singers. Most are and it is a worthy experience.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The Room keeps me thinking where clues would be hidden. I have not solved the puzzle but enjoy the lure of success.
B00D9RQO56|5.0|I grew up to watching this movie, and I can watch it over and over! Tim Burton is amazing. The characters, and singing is so unique and awesome! Wished there was a part 2!<br /> Lol, sometimes I wish I was Mrs. Skellington, anyone else!? ^_^
0140120416|5.0|I am starting Russian lessons as a very intimidated beginner. This book dispelled a lot of my fears (i.e. How can I ever learn a language about which I know absolutely nothing?) and then pushes right away. There is no dawdling around with silly or unnecessary chapters; each one builds on the prior and if you stay focused, you will feel like there is substantial progress with each page turned and learned. I am learning from a native Russian and we use this book as our textbook because it is so intuitive to the language learning process. There are also some fantastic (free) resources online that I have used to supplement as well (FSI Language Institute offers a free course that is excellent) . The only minor drawback is that this version is written for a British audience so some of the pronunciation guides are slightly different than I would have expected from an 'American' version. This is no big deal, because the quality of the book is unparalleled for a beginning or intermediate Russian learner.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|I will never understand why the visionaries of today's TV and film so often go umrecognized. Kudos to Boss for an excellent series. I'm extremely encouraged that this program received the cult following it deserved
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great story. Hard to put this one down. Looking forward to the next Grisham book to add to my collection.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I am thrilled this was my introduction to using the Kindle I got for my birthday:) Her strong sense of self is an inspiration to everyone, while the humor carries her points beautifully.<br />This book belongs on my list of  &#34;Oh, you have to read this !&#34;.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|The beginning was good but it dragged on and became a bit far fetched. at least it ended on a good note - i.e. left you wondering
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Its nice for the price.  It's cool to cast youtube and netflix, but you can't really cast anything else.  Give it a year and see if HBOGo supports it in the native app, then it great!
B009NH6AOQ|3.0|It was ok you got to a point where you knew what was going to happen next so it was ok
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, demeaning to females, a poor innocent virgin (who by the way is totally gorgeous but doesn't realize it) meets a gorgeous, rich man who not only deflowers her , but also awakens her sexually to need, to crave being bound, gagged and dominated sexually. Seriously? Did somebody say, \\"Hmmm lets see, how many different hackneyed themes and scenarios can I string together using sex and ok, I'll throw in SOME dialogue not about sex so it seems like the characters can string a few thoughts together  and oh yes, MORE sex and call it a book, maybe even a LOVE story!\\" ?<br />You know how when you were a teenager, you got a sexy book and kinda read it just to get to the \\"hot\\" parts and be titillated? Well with this you skip the sex and try to find a story line to justify reading it. Oh and let's not forget this stud not only  has an enormous fortune and an enormous penis but an enormous heart and is trying to end world hunger ! And he is a tormented soul just waiting for the right girl  to open his heart, home  and soul to. Honestly,  I am an avid reader and I always try to finish every book I start even if it is crap. When I finished the last page  I was just relieved to be done and sad I had wasted part of my lifespan reading it. Just  tripe. There should be negative star ratings. Maybe it WAS written by a teenager?
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I probably should give it a 3. Season 1 was more entertaining. The episodes have a very negative feeling, but still keeps you entertained.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Such a good feel time movie. Get up and dance, sing along and just let the world go by as you watch this silly, fun and loving story. Meryl Streep shows her versatility. Fun to see the direction that shows over reactions and big gestures. We watch this with the kids and all get up and dance.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am so pleased to be able to rate this Kindle book published by Amazon. I used this book to produce my first book, and will be using it as THE resource to guide me in putting together every book I publish on KDP. It is a step-by-step guide that, when followed, will get your book published without faults -- what we all want to have happen!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|CHROMECAST: I purchased Google's new toy. The first problem is compatibility. It will not work with Windows XP so the tower in the living room will not work with it. My Amazon Kindle uses Google's operating system but it will not work any way. I tried to install it on my AT&T Samsung Galaxy III that uses the Android operating system but could not get it to work. The only place it works is on my Samsung laptop with Windows 7 but only with the Google Chrome browser.<br /><br />Then a message pops up saying that using Chromecast can degrade the video. It is true. Some video sources are OK but if the original is not the best  or if the server can not keep up with the buffering it is worse.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Makes me want to watch the movies. Very fun and allows you to collect dollars easier than some build games. The graphics and sound effects are fabulous.
B00CATSONE|5.0|It is a abook that amazed me.  Learning about the knowledge his vision of the future, lead to many new inventions.  I also learned about the way he managed to finance his developments and al the mistakes he made and all the troubles he went thru.  All of the above geve me a human view of a real inventor.  A masterpiece!!![[ASIN:B00CATSONE Nikola Tesla: Imagination and the Man That Invented the 20th Century]]
B00ESY77LO|5.0|Amazing makes me want to be there. You dont know whats coming next great effects. Would watch over and over and see something new each time

B0084LQHN6|5.0|Fun, young, fresh, witty, candid. I want to dance, and I can feel the ferocity of her artistry in every song!
B008FRFN7A|3.0|It used to work but now whenever I open the app it takes me to the appstore. I click open but it does'nt open. I tried to delete the app but it says &quot;app not found in list of installed applications&quot;. Please fix it.
B00C32REYI|5.0|This album has so much depth in each song. You think a song is going one way, and then James Blake takes you to an unforeseen level of listening. Bravo!
B0031RS8SA|4.0|The book is a good insight into life in an immigrant area and how various newcomers adjust to the move to a different culture.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Can't help but wonder if we would take the long walk if we were chosen. Gripping and fascinating all at the same time. Good read.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Me and the new wife love this. Very fun we are going to watch the next season's hope there as good as the first.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Easy to use, very clear and accurate. Only thing I'd want to change is the layout for daily forecast - let us tap the cross button to get hour by hour temperature changes
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I love my Garmin! Its been really great to use on runs. I've had it for 5 months and have thoroughly enjoyed it. The best feature is being able to upload it to the garmin connect and see the data over a period of time. The only problem is that the touch feature is not very sensitive, so sometimes it takes a little effort to scroll through information. But, since I don't do that while I'm running, it really hasn't bothered me too much.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|What an awesome series. My husband and I were up very late. We didn't want to stop watching it!!! I can't wait to watch the next one!!!
B00F1BFRA6|5.0|My title says it all,, after watching TV for almost 60 years,, this was the BEST I have ever seen..  I can not say a word more than what has already been written about this EXCELLENT program!!
0805047905|5.0|Came in a timely manner and the book was in great condition. My daughter loves it definitly a flashback moment for me when i was a child.
B00DW5IM9Q|4.0|I was afraid this album would be like so many other collections of demos and unreleased tunes-just a vault mining exercise to generate profits by a record company trying to maximize profits of an artist while he is still relevant. These types of recordings often contain scraps and junk from the editing sessions and are usually not worth the time of anyone except the most diehard of collectors. This is not one of those albums-it is very strong and contains material that is listenable in both content, the re-mixing and editing of old material. It is a must have for all Dylan-philes and fans of that era's music.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used this app almost every day. It was wonderful.  I liked the format and the easy accessibility.  I definitely recommended it.  Now, I realize it took up a lot of space.  My kindle was so slow.  Half the time it wouldn't even open.  Now I have weather bug.  So much more helpful.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Fantastic plot, never a dull moment.  The first five to six chapters were a bit confusing with the numerous characters and families that changed per chapter. If you hang in there and keep reading, you soon come to realize how the families and individual characters get intertwined and know one another...I was looking for chapter headings to help me along the way and there weren't any. I am glad I didn't give up!  This was a well written novel.
0345529057|5.0|wonderful read, engaging characters and well-developed plot.  you won't be disappointed! can't wait to get the rest of the series!
1844137872|5.0|Once again, Banksy has no problem with satirically setting up words and images to really get people to think about the ridiculousness that is everyday life. The book was organized well and in Preston's condition when I received it.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This magnificent, exquisite film is so superior to most of what Hollywood turns out that any self-aware producer should be acutely embarrassed by it. Nevertheless, I'd like to offer a slightly negative perspective.<br /><br />\\"Life of Pi\\" is easy to criticize for being a bit sentimental and unduly \\"cute\\" *. Its worst failing is a glib ambiguity as to what it's \\"about\\". After promising the Writer that, after hearing the story, he will believe in God, Pi says \\"It simply happened. Does it have to have a meaning?\\" This suggests the author has no intended meaning for this story, which is reinforced by the suggestion that what we believe is what we would like to believe -- be it about Pi's adventures or the nature of God.<br /><br />Nevertheless, don't miss it -- especially if you have a 60\\" or larger display. The PG rating is apt; there are moments that will frighten some pre-teens.<br /><br />On a technical level, CGI artists still don't understand F=ma (the lifeboats slide on the water like fried eggs on Teflon), and the orangutan doesn't really look like an orangutan, and moves an awful lot like a human being.<br /><br />* Richard Parker's name is supposed to be amusing. It was a result of inadvertently assigning the name of the man who caught him to the animal. I suspect the misnaming is supposed to parallel Pi's assertion that he can see the animal's soul in its eyes.
B00D7JGUB4|4.0|I bought this album on vinyl. The US edition is a single LP and it is colored. I don't know if they all are of the same color. Mine is blue. Simple 180gm vinyl. No CD, no MP3 code included.<br /><br />The vinyl on the first play is a little noisy on my system (more noticeable when music is quiet). Also with the whole album being on a single LP, the sound is not that open and rich.<br /><br />The album itself gets a solid B from me. People will always judge new stuff from a band they like differently. Some will say new album is horrible, some - it is the best. I liked this one. It is not sensational. Just very good.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Got it for my 13 year old daughter, she loved it! Since she liked it so much I thought I would read it. I had a hard time with the book because of the subject matter. My best friend died of cancer, my sister-in-law died of cancer, my grandfather died of cancer, my nephew lost his leg to bone cancer, and my husband is a cancer survivor. So, I think this book is directed and written for YA who have not experienced the tragedies of cancer first hand.
0307341577|4.0|I like it a lot. At first it was a little boring to be honest but I kept continue reading it and it was getting really interesting. Then I cannot put this book down. It is WOW.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|My child loves this show.  I think I have seen it 80 times now.  This was the only way I could find this movie where it was not on VHS from her daycare provider's house.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This book relly SUCKS! It is so boring pleased don't read this just don't read it. PLEASE! ! ! !
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A most of Neil Gaiman's stories do, this drew me right in. I loved being caught up in the world he created, and read this through quickly.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I like the game but I don't like all the lag that happens once in a while otherwise I really just enjoy playing the game.
B00B1TJO10|5.0|This guide is well-organized, readable, thorough, and best of all -- not boring!  This book (along with a Great teacher) has actually reduced much of the anxiety that attends attempting to dig into any topic that is typically produced in a dry, pedantic manner but especially math.  The contents are colorful, the humor sophomoric, sometimes dark (and British) and the authors humble, self-deprecating tone, further serves to reduce math anxiety.  This is my go-to book for most purposes.  It doesn't go quite far enough -- there is no mention of Bayes, or SEM, for instance -- but it does include factor analysis and is quite modern in its coverage of effect sizes, power, and such.  The publisher has power points etc for teacher usage, and content for students that reflects Field's style: real research on, er, not always the most serious of topics.  Love this book!  (I'd probably get my copy signed if the author ever came to California, and that's not something I'd say about many, any?, textbooks.
0307352153|4.0|Love the book. Enjoying it now. Worth the wait. Very good and efficient service. Will definitely order again in the future.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green's &#34;The Fault in Our Stars&#34; is one of those books whose recommendation comes with a rather large, red, pulsating asterisk. Here is a list of conditions that are the only reasons that you shouldn't read this book.<br />1. You don't like books about cancer.<br />2. You don't like love stories.<br />3. You don't like being sad.<br />4. You don't like reading.<br />Well I can't exactly put up a title like that, give it five stars, and then tell you not to read this. So yes, if none of the above restrictions apply to you, then I highly suggest you take as much space as possible out of the way between your eyeballs and this book.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|Was intrigued by the title and the reviews sounded good, but after reading this book I felt as if I wasted my time.  Not much here and the premise was absurd.  One positive thing about the book was that it wasn't long.  Bottom line:  don't bother.
B004XWLIJS|5.0|A lot of action scenes, decent plot and a few unexpected surprises. I liked the movie. It was very entertaining.
B009NX409M|3.0|Nice movie without too many complications. One can watch it and follow it while doing something else. The performances are good.
B00CE0ZY46|5.0|Watching Shaun the Sheep or Wallace and Gromit is a terrific way to relax and unwind with some great laughs.  I am always totally amazed that this is claymation; the skill and artistry of these productions is incredible.  I also happen to be delighted by the British architecture and style.  Great stuff!  Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
B0064MGU98|5.0|It was great, & addicting, you can't wait to find out what will happen next!!  Same goes for season 2
B00F91H666|2.0|Brad Pitt in crazy go wrong world.  Not rated to violent.  Parents don't let kids under 17 see it.  It could never happen zombie part. Don't know why they added.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|And it does that very well with the tapered hone.  The knife sharpeners are a good bonus, and wide enough for most blades.
B00F35BV64|5.0|A very goood film hard to get use to new actors miss old ones.  One has cameo in it.  I recommend for all ages.
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|(long time fan here) lets make this clear, there is no way to replace, recapture, or recreate a Queensryche of 'EP' through 'Promised Land'.  i was not impressed the first time i listened to this (Q-2013), but i have warmed up to it more and more with repeated listening.  my biggest problem is not with Todd's singing, but that it seems so buried in the mix - needs to be more prominent. not quite as good of a match as what happened to 'Journey', but there are times i find myself saying \\"DAMN the sounds just like Geoff! - WOW\\".  i also would have liked a little more keyboards and creativity - like in 'Rage' or 'Warning', this is more strait forward in comparison. like others have said, it is a step in the right direction, and they are putting some \\"metal\\" back into Queensryche. i had pretty much given up after Q2k, although i think 'Tribe' is a pretty damn good cd and is at least tied maybe a bit better than 'Promised Land'.  I do not think either new incarnation of Queensryche can give us what we are REALLY craving for ever again. what made Geoff's voice so special EP-EMPIRE (his range and what he did with it).... he simply doesn't/can't do it anymore.  Todd doesnt quite sound 'enough' like him to really replace him.  i do think \\"Queensryche\\" needs a singer with a high register.... but not necessarily one who sounds that(occasionally)close to Geoff. i bought mine at the concert for $10 and pre-autographed, i cant say as i have buyers remorse, and this is the best thing in a LONG time, but it is not good enough (to me) to be in heavy rotation like EP-EMPIRE..... which music is so creative and of such high quality makes Q an even better band (musicianship) than even Zep and Sabbath.  like i said, for me, this does get better with every listen (probably about 10 now)but if your on the fence because you got burned on some later releases and have lost faith.... use youtube and listen a few times WITH AN OPEN MIND. because this is most of the original band i didnt care toomuch if i was less than impressed, they deserve as much money and recognition as possible for giving us such a large back catalog of stunning music. this is a welcome and new and fresh and long overdue \\"beginning\\" for Queensryche, but do not believe either party will ever produce another cd that can stand up to their older work. but compared to \\"todays\\" music........ 11 out of 10!!!!
B000OVLINI|2.0|I was really excited to read this book but I'm only about a third of the way through and don't really want to finish it. It moves too slow. I can tell the main plot is interesting and I want to know what happens but there is so much other stuff going on that I don't care about! I don't know if I'll ever get to the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever you should make another one of thers please.and one more thing it should be free because i love it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was exactly what I was expecting, it's on par with every other Nicholas Sparks book. If you like his other works you'll enjoy this, if you don't like his stuff don't expect something different in Safe Haven. It's a quick, easy read - a good book for taking on vacation.
B000002L7Y|3.0|got this one for my gal. She likes it and always has it on the list to listen too with her other favorites
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Sort of Dorothy meets The Richest Man in Babylon - a classic style tale with a wise message.  A really inspiring read.
B00004Y6NP|4.0|like the sound and the hits that keep coming with each track ,nice to sit back to something cold to drink and smoke too
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I really liked the way that Thor &#34;grew&#34; in his understanding of Grace and Mercy similar to how a boy grows up into a man.  Unlike most Hollywood/New York media these days, His charactor acurately shows what Manhood is really supposed to look like...sacrificing oneself for the good of others.  Our Military does this every day.
B0009XNUK0|4.0|what can you add to the gloved one. Such a long list of hits a good sound from boy to man, and a lot to listen too
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have found the Bible to be easy to use on the Kindle, though it shuts down unexpectedly.  It is easier to carry than a large book.
B007WOFXB8|4.0|what can you say about the little/big band from Texas, pull out 1 of the C D's and let her rip
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Sandra is one of my favorite actress. This movie totally surprised me with her nude scene, yet not nude. This lady has a lot of class as you can see in this funny movie. Betty White was her usual calm hilarious self. They paired super stars up just right in this movie.<br />There was a delightful plot, beautiful scenery, even the puppies was super stars. I really enjoyed this movie. Soon to become a classic. I have a collection of Ms. Bullock movies which I look at repeatedly. I give this one a 5 star rating.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Loved this story which I \\"read\\" on audio and would highly recommend.  Both narrators did tremendous job but \\"Park\\" was especially amazing - a voice like honey.<br />A story of first love that's really beautiful in that it features a boy and a girl who both consider themselves misfits of sorts and yet are beautiful in each others eyes.  It's not a love at first sight but a slow realization of what they mean to each other.  The 80s references are great - funny for those of us who grew up at that time.  Some swearing but overall a clean read.  Good recommendation for teens struggling with acceptance or self-esteem issues.  Great message about getting to know someone and then falling in love with the whole package.  The things you may hate about your physical appearance may be what attracts a future boyfriend/girlfriend. Highly recommended.
B00471Z3CI|5.0|This was a great movie, not sure what age group is appropriate for watching but I forgot that this movie had drug usage and swearing in the majority of the movie.  Still a classic movie and highly recommend....
B004HD61KE|3.0|I'm not done with James Rollins yet...but this definitely wasn't one of his best.  He always proposes intriguing possibilities that seem to come out of left field (at high speed, pursued by grenade-hucking hotties in black leather...oh yeah: plus a heroic dog), but this one fell a bit short of breathtaking for me.  If you read them all--this one will do; if you read just one or two--pick another.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I just love John Mayer. Anything he does will get 5 stars. This album has more of a country swang to it, but not necessarily country music. The only thing I dislike about the album is that Frank Ocean's song is not longer in it. Such a pretty voice.

B005GIS1WA|3.0|it is cute and shows the reason for saving our environment and wildlife. the color is great and the length of time is good
B0026772N8|5.0|I read this when I was young...and took off cross-country on my motorcycle.  I re-read the book and am now ready to buy another motorcycle in my retirement.  If my wife will let me!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love historical fiction, especially about WWII. I especially enjoyed how we saw this from all angles, an American perspective, a German perspective, etc. It really made for a well rounded story, because every story has more than one side.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This is one that my children love to play with. It can easily keep us busy and engaged for a while which comes in handy when waiting for an appointment, etc.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Dark and a little disturbing, but definitely interesting. Pretty much kept me guessing the whole time which is always nice. I even felt bad for the characters, pitied their situation a little bit.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I saw the movie at the theater so wanted to have it in my home collection.  This was a complimentary rental that had terrible audio levels.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great!!!!!! This game continues to change making it a challenge for me and my family. My children love this game.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I very much enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing until well into it. I like a plot with some twists and turns and this definitely had it. I would recommend it. I read it on the beach in a day.
030758836X|5.0|Very we'll written - not just a chick read - my husband couldn't put it down.  There's a reason it's been in the NY TIMES Best Seller List.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|In the first person voice of our main character Charlie, [[ASIN:B003TSEEDY The Perks of Being a Wallflower]] leads the reader through the day to day moments in one young teenager's life, during his first year in high school.<br /><br />The narration comes through letters written to \\"Dear Friend,\\" an unknown recipient.  We know that Charlie lives in a city, but not which one.  The time period is the early 1990s.<br /><br />It is clear that Charlie is very bright, judging from the books he is reading, given to him by a teacher who takes a special interest in him.  He also is very introspective, almost too much so, as he tends to hold himself back from others, like an observer rather than a participant.  He develops friendships, but only after a period of time, and by the end of the year, he realizes that all of these friends, older than he, are leaving for college and he will be alone again.  At this point, an emotional crisis brings him to a point where he must examine some issues.<br /><br />What moments in Charlie's early life changed how he views and engages with others?  How will he finally learn or remember about those events?<br /><br />It took me awhile to connect with the story and the writing style, but when I did, I literally could not put it down.  And this book is not my usual reading genre.  But Charlie stands out from other teen characters I have encountered, so that says something about why the story resonated with me.<br /><br />By the end of the story, I was so invested in Charlie and his story that I didn't want it to end.  He is definitely not the typical teen, yet he experiences all the usual emotions of that time in a teenager's life.  A very memorable young man.  A five star read.
0439023513|5.0|This entire series was wonderful. From the first chapter to the very last, you are sucked into the world Collins writes about. The first movie did not do the first book justice, but I suppose that is almost always the case. These books leave you thinking, and wanting to read them again. The final in the series is no exception.
1559409010|5.0|The film arrived quickly and were in great shape. I will use them again for future purchases. Thank you for your interest

I'm not done with the book yet and I will finish it cause I rarely leave a book unfinished but probably not going to get the next in the series.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a classic movie that every crime/drama fan must have in their arsenal! Excellent characters, fantastic movie. Kevin Spacey is incredible.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining. try to save your gems when tougher quests come. and I love the music.<br /><br />,
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It meet my expectation, and charge my son kindle HD fine compared to the other take 6 hour to Charge.
B00COHIFQS|3.0|Ok I was all into this movie until right before the ending or what they called the ending. The movie starts off great with a good storyline that had me just in wonder of what was going on or what was going to happen next. I am a big fan of movies that keep you guessing/ trying to place pieces together but as far as current movies I am really not seeing any creativity nor great endings.  I would say yes to watching the movie but don't except a good ending.
B00C6B8EJK|5.0|This review is for the 2013 steelbook. No complaints, graphics are cool front and back. It's everything you'd expect it to be.
B00ECU2SGS|2.0|A movie to watch if your bored no action just somewhat of a drama storyline. No need to go out of your way to watch (if on your list of movies make it the last one).
B00AB2DNBU|5.0|EVERYTING ABOUT THE STEELBOOK BLURAY IS SWEET. First of all all the art on the case itself looks cool. Secondly this is PACKED with special features. I cant really compare the amount of extras to other releases because i don't really know for sure what the others have on them, BUT this release has ALOT of cool interviews commentary and behind the scenes footage and more.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Good movie to watch has a good storyline and a good ending. Matthew McConaughey plays his role really well and just like in real life in the movie karma comes around like a b***h.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is an easy read yet it has all of the wit, charisma, and hilarity expected from Tina Fey. Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book gave some insight into NDEs.  I highly recommend it to both believers and non-believers.  It will change the way you look at this world.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This game is better than the first Angry birds star wars. The graphics are great, you get new birds and abilities, you can even join the pigs!
B008LXZFH6|4.0|Will Farrel at his best with a great comedic ensemble. Do not miss this movie if enjoy a quirky and fun-filled entertaining comedy!
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Some of the levels were easy to figure out but others took several tries. You do have to use logic in playing the game and I like that. The one thing I did not like was you do not have the option of turning off the music...at least I did not see that option. I am looking forward to playing Sugar Sugar 2.
B009AY04A8|1.0|Great games until chapter 16.  It stops working in the church basement and proceeds to list the names of people who created it.  Ads say 65 levels. No way. I tried 4 times and it blew up at beginning of chapter 16 Each time.<br /><br />Was fun while it lasted.!
B00ET47USI|4.0|Once you get it,  it's a lot of fun, . And I love that you don't have to do black red black red.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Yes, I have an iPhone, but that doesn't mean I want to spend hundreds of dollars on all the accessories, so it was nice to find a good quality case that wasn't a lot of money.<br /><br />The only suggestion I have is to put on the screen protector, then let it sit and &#34;cure&#34; for a while before you try to put on the case.  Of course, I wanted to do it all at once because I have no patience.  When I was trying to get the last corner of the case over the phone, it pushed on the screen protector and pulled up the edge so that it didn't want to lay down right.  I had to take the case off, fix the screen protector, then tried again.  I was able to get it on the second try.  Probably would have been easier if it came with a small plastic tool to help get the edge of the case over the phone because it is pretty tight.  But, you want it tight so that your phone is snug, so what are ya gonna do?<br /><br />I have dropped my phone multiple times (wood floor, concrete driveway, tile floor, etc) and...knock on wood...have yet to crack my screen.  Also, the case is made of rubber, so it does not get damaged when I drop it.  I have had previsions cases that were made of hard plastic and even though they protected my phone, they eventually cracked and broke.  So in my mind, this case has gone above and beyond my expectations.<br /><br />Keep in mind, this case is not easy to get on and off, so if you like to switch things up a lot, then this probably isn't for you.  Once it's on, it's best to leave it on.  I don't switch my case so this worked great for me.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|THE GAME IS FUN TO PLAY ONCE IT LOADED. TOO BAD IT TAKES FOR EVER TO LOAD AND SOME TIMES SLOWS DOWN.
1439190275|4.0|This is a good book. It gives all of the latest research on low carb eating while staying true to Dr. Atkins original plan. Things that have been updated is being able to eat things like yogurt and tomatoes while losing weight is great. That being said, if you really want to know the WHY of low carb eating, then you need Dr. Atkin's New Diet Revolution. That book is going to give you the in-depth explanation of why low cab (not no carb) eating is superior to low cal. Buy both books and you'll have your bases covered.<br /><br />If this book had the same in-depth info that the older book has, I would have given this 5 stars.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Perhaps one of the greatest science fiction films of the 1950s, after The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Thing from Another World.  The special effects, color, the sets and even the matte paintings are magnificent. The iconic Robbie the Robot is great and at times a hoot.  The story is great, though a bit cerebral for lovers of B films. I would not call this a B film.  I can see where the idea for the original Star Trek might have come from this movie.  My only gripe is that I wish cover art was the original poster.  This DVD release also includes The Invisible Boy, a minor black and white B sci-fi film that has the distinction of having Robbie the Robot in it.  Highly recommended.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I watch old movies and love the fact I can Google an actors name from the 30's.  My cup of tea,searching names from my childhood.  Love it!
B004ZH66XO|3.0|This was already the free app of the day, near the beginning.  I don't like repeats.  So, technically there was not free app of the day today....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great fun for the whole family! It makes you really remember where everything is at. So looking forward to more levels, hopefully coming very soon!
B00F91H666|5.0|I'm a girl and don't normally like the zombie thing. But this movie showed different sides to it and was actually really good. Highly recommend it.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|ordered this series on 9/17 got it on 9/19 and I live on an island! I am just about to watch the magic, do yourself a favor and order this series now.
B000067FP8|5.0|Really fun movie to watch with friends over who are just as crazy as &#34;new batch&#34; in the movie, a great time was had by all.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|still haven't figured how to link this game to my face book, but I love the game and play everyday.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|My two nieces and nephew simple love this movie - smile all around and now they want a little gizmo to play with, okay, just as long as he/she doesn't get wet!
B0063M22QO|3.0|very easy to play from my kindle fire, seems easier to play then from my computer. I play this game everyday.
B00D4K8SBQ|4.0|I haven't used the camera connector yet, just the memory card reader.  It seems to work great!  I bought it because I travel with an iPad and wanted to email and post pictures taken with my camera while I was on the road.  This seemed like a lightweight and easily portable solution to getting my photos from the memory card onto my iPad so I could send/post from there.  It couldn't have been easier.  I plugged the reader into my iPad and inserted the memory card and right away the screen came up with my photos.  You can pick which ones you want to import (if you don't want to import all) and it imported them quickly.<br /><br />My only wish is that they made one for CF memory cards - the camera I use for most of my pictures takes these cards so I could only import pictures taken with the other camera. This was my only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5.
B00CTT9646|4.0|If you're getting this item for the phaser replica, be warned:  it is an inert piece of metal and plastic.  Not even a flashing light.  It's a hefty, attractive ornament, but that's all.  I got it because I thought the phaser was somehow a disk case (like the Enterprise replica for the first movie), but it's not.<br /><br />But this movie is AMAZING!  Every bit as good as the first one, and that is saying quite a lot.  J.J. Abrams and the writers and the cast and the crew are brilliant, and I'd like to hug them all and shake their hands.  Breathtakingly fabulous!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|Wow!  This 2CD pack has it all. If you like the BeeGees you will love this pack. They cover everything and sound so great. My only warning is to be ready to get out of you chair and move!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This is one of my most favorite movies - this is a replacement copy for a previous release that was worn out.
B009NY43NY|1.0|How could anyone give this book anything above 1 star? I have followed this series for years and was so disappointed at the way Charlaine Harris ended the series. It was as though she did not take the time to do it right. The ending was not for the loyal fans she has had over the years, where was the effort? Over the years I put up with her poor writing and her forgetting her books but this was not at all acceptable. Charlaine you made your money and now you are gone! I cannot put into words how heartbroken I was over you not caring.
B00F91G5BS|1.0|Unfortunately, this is a really terrible adaptation of World War Z.  The book was thoughtful, compelling, insightful.  Much more than a zombie thriller.  The movie has pretty much nothing to do with the book.  It's more of a remake of 28 Days Later (or whatever that other zombie movie was), where the zombies are super-fast like werewolves.  It's really awful.  And the Brad Pitt family is terrible.  You actually want his kids and wife to get eaten just to get them out of the storyline, because they are nothing but hindrance and annoyance.  Especially the crying kid who then insists she's not a baby.  I know it's supposed to impart a human touch, but seriously all you want is for them to get eaten and get off the screen.  The compelling part of the film is when there aren't millions of digital zombies, and there's real human drama.  Unfortunately, that's about 15 minutes of the movie.  The remainder is typical car crashes, explosions, aerial shots at locations around the world, and pretty much people doing stupid things in the midst of crisis.  Definitely NOT worth renting.  5 minutes into it I was sorry I spent the money.
B003XDZNLW|5.0|I love these shoes. I wear them for work and going out. They are very comfortable. I would recommend them to anyone who has problem feet.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game has exciting new puzzles to figure out. You will not get bored with this game and will have lots of fun.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I really like the book . The story is written well. It keeps you constantly guessing about what will happen or who did it. I highly recommend the book. Do prepare for violence.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|\\"The sleepwalkers\\" is a truly fascinating read. Yes, you get the facts, the context, but you also get a vivid picture of the characters involved in the massive drama that was WW1. The author has recreated with great skill the time, and the places and the humans that shaped those events.  I felt transported  one hundred years back.  I was a fly on  the wall in the smoky, noisy coffee houses of Belgrade where  a revolution was brewing.  I was a witness to  the  most exclusive conversations of the power brokers of that era. I got to see their strengths, their most human of weaknesses, flaws and  foibles.  To me the story  resembles the story of the final stages of a long and opulent  party  permeated by our hindsight of  an impending devastating hangover.    The opinions, preconceptions  and decisions  of the leaders of that era were shaped by their time, and in turn, their decisions shaped their epoch, and helped ushered in the \\"modern\\" period of our common history. WW1 was one of the most consequential of human events, and this story of how it came to be  shows that reality beats fiction everytime.
0316113506|5.0|I used this to prove a point in my school. I hope this will soon create change in the school systems. It will be a fight but the author proves the validity in what he is saying. Cross your fingers that school systems will listen to his research.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Great story with lots of potential but I think the story telling fell short of making it a great movie. Stunning visually and a great watch for sci-fi fans.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson is a genius at creating worlds for his stories to reside in.  His descriptions are through, and show a lot of effort being put into background development.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|apply this to your life and ask where do i stand<br />and how do every day things impact your life
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book hit the nail on the head. Was very on point, i Love this book, its a must get

B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is very enjoyable to play. It's great that you can play the game even when you aren't on WiFi.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|Very good story. Great comedy. Good history lesson. Makes one think about the world and human relations. Laughter is good for the soul.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is so much fun, I recommend it highly! The sweet little guy has such a funny look when you don't give the treat to him....wait and see!
B00006GFAB|3.0|I'm not a Kiss fan but I like some of their songs.As is the case in compilations,there's always something that you wish was on it .Would have liked the live version of Firehouse from Alive and Domino.All in all, a decent collection for the casual listener.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of John Green's work (including his novels and various web shows - mental floss, vlog brothers, etc) and this book was one of the best. It's bring made into a movie and I am really looking forward to that. Read this book and DFTBA!
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|This movie was a sleeper hit, I didn't watch it in the theater because I didn't have high expectations for it.  I rented and was amazed on how good this movie was, so I had to buy it.  If you haven't seen it you have to give this movie a chance.
B007P2DQJI|1.0|I bought this replacement &#34;original&#34; battery thinking it would be as good as, if not better than my current Samsung stock battery which is quite old now.<br /><br />Sadly, I was wrong. The first few charges ran down fast, but I expected that from a new battery. I thought after some conditioning, it would find its groove. It didn't.<br /><br />Three months later, a full charge only lasts about 8 hours, with minimal use. My original stock battery is way better than this. Fortunately, I found another stock battery and I started using it with my original, and now I get way more life from the pair of those than this.<br /><br />I think either this was a bad batch, or this is not an original Galaxy Nexus Battery.<br /><br />Or maybe it was just a bad seller. My seller was PNE Enterprises, INC by the way.<br /><br />Golden Rule: Only buy from Amazon.
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|Novak caught my attention because of his fighting spirit and exemplary technique. He and several others broke into the top tennis ranks out of war torn Serbia enduring hardship and luck of training facilities. This is an unbelievable achievement in tennis sport by itself. I started to follow his matches but saw him gasping for air being unable to compete further in tough final sets. Suddenly he made a break through and broke into top 3! What happened? It was gluten! Novak went gluten free. At first I thought he follows a new popular fad, but I met people suffering with gluten allergies and saw how it could be bad in extreme sensitivity cases. When I saw his book, I read it right away captivated with his adventure with tennis, diet and meditation. Meditation could be recommended to anybody, but gluten free diet? Sports nutritionists featured in Tennis magazine advise to eat pasta before matches. I did that and it kept me going in final sets. What about gluten free, should I try it?  Novak in his book advises to listen to your body and to pay attention to signals it is sending to you. This summer I was suffering with a prolonged case of allergies: my eyes would burn, eyelids swollen, sinuses and nose was clogged. It was difficult to breath through the nose during play; I was breathing through the mouth. I found relief in daily regiment of 24h allegra-D. As a sportsman I am afraid of allergy drugs: they affect thinking and balance, and this nasty pseudoephedrine every day! Ten years ago I started to drink beer during dinners and while watching TV at night, just a few, not much. As a result I added pretty fast 10 stubborn pounds around my waist. So I thought, maybe I should try to go gluten free also? I like veggies, it was easy for me. Pasta, bread, and beer - out! Next day I was able to breath without allergy pill, my nose cleared. On the third day while watching US Open I habitually grabbed a beer, 5 min later my nose got clogged. Aha! This is a gluten sensitivity symptom! Two weeks later on gluten free regiment I'm writing this review: my mind is clearer, I am calmer, more at peace with the world and myself, I can breath through my nose during the game, my sugar balance is better, I do not have urges to eat something right away to fight off sudden hunger, and I shed 7 pounds! Thank you Nole, you showed me an exemplary way to follow. Life without beer and pasta is possible - and it is bright and beautiful! Read this book, maybe it will help you too in some way :)<br />Large portion of Djokovic book is devoted to various recipes of gluten-free meals. I skipped it for now to return to them later and try them out.<br />Few word about myself: 5.0 NTRP, one handed backhand, idols: Sampras, Federer.
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|A great show where I have to give thanks to my friend for not stopping telling me to watch. The Doctor was hilarious in the way his attitude was. *Spoiler alert* I was very sad at the end of the last episode when The Doctor had to transform. I really liked him. And since I still have yet to watch the season 1 Christmas special, I like the Doctor's voice from all of season 1 better. I have a lot to catch up on so maybe I'll warm up to David. But in all, this is a great show so far. I will suggest friends to watch it
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I didn't like this film.  Poor acting, visuals, poorly made movie.  I am glad i had amazon prime so it was free.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Definitely a movie everyone should see! I like how it is more pg than the book was, so we were able to watch it as a family. My husband is thankful for the encouragement to be more purposeful in parenting.
B000SJJCX4|1.0|Works poorly, it takes several times to get the pedal to even register a note,  once it does finally realize that  then it works.  I don't know, maybe there is something wrong with mine but this is how it always has worked.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Story line not as intricate in this season but still we love the show. An emotionally traumatic season for sure!
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This was a great series and did like the good and bad.. battles that went on in the mystery series
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|like the challenge, very addictive, not enough time lapse between plays.  do not like the boosters provided, please change if possible
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|enjoyed watching this with my family! but who would love some Matthew Anyway!! good story line and had a pretty good ending
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Downloaded the app cant download books as I am not a uk resident triead on the french site but still cannot download books as they say I haven,t got the app.
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is a nice combo of humor, lite drama, relationships set in a law office with good vs evil. Fun to watch!
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yes this is great to have and I use it ofen.  I recommend this to every one who has the kindle
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app. The alarm clock works great and you can use any music that is on your kindle. The weather feature is great for planning your day without having to open another app.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Very easy to use &amp; fast! Even for someone my age. Frees up cache &amp; deletes browser history. Would highly recommend for anyone using a tablet!!
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|great graphics.gopher has an evil laugh but knowsh<br /> how to motivate you. I like the commentary just like watching the PGA.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Very nice. Love the dual functionality and the smaller tip. It makes it more precise for me to use. The price is excellent too, as expected of Amazon Basic products. I will buy this item again if i need another one or lose this one.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Same rich world, same interesting characters, same hundreds of pages that don't forward the plot much and then kill a well liked character to make us gasp.<br /><br />I've read this before. Four times. Get on with it already.
B000002KZ6|5.0|\\"Speaking in Tongues\\" by Talking Heads is their best album. The reason I think that because the music is tight, wildly original, and experimental. This album was released in 1983 and \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" was the epitome of New Wave and for me personally, this album is a New Wave masterpiece. This was the first album that Talking Heads produced on their own. They ended their long-term collaboration with producer Brian Eno and what could've been a disaster without his expertise, turned out to be the Talking Heads finest moment. There are A LOT of synths on \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" which makes this album memorable and perfect for the time period. Synths can either strengthen or weaken a song if not done correctly, but the Talking Heads use the synths/loops/samples to display their musical abilities/talents and this album brought them into the mainstream with the first single, \\"Burning Down the House\\". \\"Burning...\\" is a timeless song that still sounds relevant/fresh all these years later (love the record scratching), but I'm glad that's not the only standout track from \\"Speaking in Tongues\\". There are 9 tracks and there is not one I skip over. David Byrne proves he's a fantastic songwriter and vocalist (I like when he sings in his lower register especially in the song \\"Swamp\\"). He was called a \\"mad genius\\" during his peak and it's pretty obvious why. He knew how to write a quirky song, give it flavor and then add his special touch of \\"weirdness\\" flawlessly. All these songs on \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" I would classify as dance tracks expect \\"This Must Be The Place (Naïve Melody)\\" which is Byrne's most beautiful ballad. The dance tracks have some very confusing, contradicting lyrics but somehow they work when they shouldn't. The theme of this album can best be described when Byrne decided to \\"stop making sense\\" literally and who knew making sense out of nonsense could be so awesome? I think my favorite track is \\"Pull Up the Roots\\" in which Byrne fully embraces his \\"neurotic\\" nature and doesn't mind losing his marbles: \\"Well I have a good time, when I go out of my mind. And it's a wonderful place, and I can't wait to be there. I hear beautiful sounds coming out of the ground...\\". But I think the best track is \\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\". The keyboards, blistering guitars from Jerry Harrison are so fluid and rich, and the song also contains my favorite lyric from Byrne: \\"And the sound inside your mind is playing all the time, playing with a heart of steel...\\" Tina Weymouth proves she's got the goods (her bass pulsates effortlessly) on the deliciously wicked, \\"Girlfriend is Better\\", and \\"Moon Rocks\\" has some spacey/trippy sound effects. Keep in mind, there is nothing artificial about these dance cuts. These songs clock in around or over 5 minutes, they are intellectual and have aged amazingly well. And of course, there is \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\". I have no clue what this song is about? At first I thought it was about making babies but each verse talks about something different and even touches on capitalism. Also Byrne openly \\"disses\\" Ronald Reagan in the lyrics which I can't help but chuckle at: \\"I can't believe it and people are strange. Our President's crazy, did you hear what he said? Business and pleasure lie right to your face. Divide it in sections and give it away...\\" The last song I will discuss is \\"Slippery People\\". This song has some gorgeous harmonies from Nona Hendryx and Dolette MacDonald. \\"Slippery People is another track that makes me scratch my head in terms of the lyrical content but musically, it's the most engaging. I think this album is brilliant. Every time I listen to it, it makes me joyful. If you're looking for a fun, zany New Wave album from the early '80s (that has substance) then \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" is the one for you. Enjoy!ature and doesn't mind losing his marbles: \\"Well I have a good time, when I go out of my mind. And it's a wonderful place, and I can't wait to be there.

B0034G4P80|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I grew up reading these comic books with my brother and would recommend this movie to everyone.
B00AS88FKG|5.0|It is truly a &#34;must-have&#34;, especially if you already own the rest of the Batman/ Dark knight movies. I'm so glad I bought it!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The seller was great.  When I was unable to play the third season I contacted her and was issued a return label and she sent me a new season 3!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am trying the 100 floor game and this game outshines it. It's not too hard and very satisfying to play. I can't wait for more updates! Smooth running on my kindle fire HD and good design! Get this app! Play it! You'll be hooked!
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you like music from the 70's to the 90's and want some history this is well worth the time.  Just a great documentary about a sound board and the performers who used it.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I haven't finished it yet but so far I am enjoying it.....first time I started it was about 1100pm..thought I would just take a look before bed....finally went to bed at 2 15 am.....sadly it was a work night....lol
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the character development in the show. The zombie issue is always there, but I love a show that is only 1 dimensional. This show is not that at all. However, the show is not for everyone. It is definitely an adult show. Kids and the delicate should stay away.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Fits my Britain B-agile stroller, and holds my giant 30 oz cup of water I carry everywhere. Great product, and the price makes it that much better!
B00DU73T08|3.0|I have this problem with just about all shows that I have read the book first, but in all fairness, the movie was faithful to the book. Some corners were cut to keep it short enough, but the major flaw was it could have had better actors. All were good, but none really stood out to me as great.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|Great 5.1 remix. Sounds amazing!<br />Lots of new info in the included booklet.<br />A worthwhile acquisition for any Crimson fan
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Good game! My three year old loves to help me find everything and gather the evidence! Good graphics and figuring out the puzzles is  challenging but not impossible. Definitely with paying a little bit for. Fun stuff.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The difference between Rodriguez and Dylan (a brilliant poet) is that Rodriguez is much more direct. His lyrics are so clean, so pure,so honest from the heart! And of course, his voice is achingly beautiful. How could his label have not promoted his albums? It's surely a crime, and I don't mean that metaphorically!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Really great story! Tom Hardy is amazing! Worth a watch for sure! I like most movies, I dont tend to be to critical. But I thought this was a great movie
B000024L0T|5.0|Contemporary tunes are so achingly bereft of complex rhythms and melodies, that we're often left feeling unsatisfied. This old album helps fill that void.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|A great book if you a great book with lots plot twists and mysteries I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the Percy Jackson novels
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I like this game because it makes you think hard about everything. I enjoy playing it since I unload it .
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard lots about this series and after my nephew and his wife highly recommended it I started watching it on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I usually have a hard time getting into the story line of these English period pieces but my nephew said it would grow on me and it has! The story is very well written and addictive!  I am in the third season and I hate to see it coming to an end.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|This is a really great product, thicker and stronger than a credit card.<br />Bright color and nice logo where the brand still in small font size (I hate branded product but i'm ok with this small font).<br />They are rewritable. Shipped and received fast.<br />I Strongly recommend this product. Definitely a must have for my Samsung Galaxy S4 !
B009GX69RK|5.0|I love this show!! I had to buy this and I watch it all the time. Cant wait for season 3!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|The used DVD is as clear as thout it were new.  I wouldn't hesitate to buy a used DVD since it's much cheaper than a new one
B00CWVFZ8W|5.0|I watched this 3 times within a 48 hour period, absolutely love it, first time i read a book and enjoyed the movie.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent story, filled with suspense. Could have used a bit of editing, as at times the narrative bogs down with repetitive detail. But this was a minor drawback for a nicely crafted novel that has interesting characters and lots of twists and turns.
B00AYB0YFQ|3.0|It was funny at the time it was released. Most of the jokes show their age but, all in all, it's still humorous.
034580404X|2.0|I purchased the first of this series brand new from a local bookstore after hearing it mentioned in the news and online and receiving rave reviews from co-workers. I NEVER spend full price on a book, but I was so intrigued by all the hype and the library had a huge waiting list and no used copies were available. I've never read an erotic novel, and after this series, I don't think I'll read another. I am one of those people who must finish a series when I've started it, no mater how horrible the first book is. I waited and waited, hoping the library would have a copy available but there was a 600 or so waiting list, so I purchased the second book in rough condition on Amazon. By the time I convinced myself to read the third and final book, the library had a copy available, so I was delighted to waste no more of my money.<br /><br />The story line was okay, but as many other reviewers stated, the main character was annoying in her naivety (really, by the end of the first book I hated this chick. Her level of knowledge about her own body is best described as Victorian) and the sex scenes were just too much, too frequent, and boring. Even in the first novel I was skipping through the sex scenes. How do you skip a sex scene? I found out it's easy. Skim the first word of each line down the page. When the repetitive \\"Ooh!\\" \\"Ah!\\" \\"Oh Christian!\\" \\"Oh Ana!\\" is replaced by, \\"They lay silently...,\\" start reading again. This alone will save you about half the book.<br /><br />I recommend you save your money and rent it from the library. It's worth reading if just to know what all the hype is about; but unless you are looking for an over-the-top, repetitive, ridiculous sex scene that is drug out over three novels, this will disappoint.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using this for a few weeks now.  As far as streaming youtube and netflix is concerned this does the best job among all its competitors in the market. It is so unbelievably easy to use and streams in full HD quality as promised. Also very easy to operate the apps themselves via mobile devices. Frankly, the amount of time I spent in front of my TV has increased many fold since I bought this.<br />The next big step would be effective wireless HDMI transfer of chrome tabs from the browser on a PC to the TV. I assume that it would take some time given the extreme heterogeneity of the content to be streamed.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was much better and held my attention more than Gone Girl.  I believe I will read dark places right away!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|It took 74 chapters before anything interesting happened.  It was like reading a soap opera- very repetetive.  The protagonist was hollow and shallow, getting by on smart remarks which became tiresome and annoying.  I'll never let anyone talk me into reading another Nelson DeMille book.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Show is great except for the nudity and the fact it keeps killing off major actors-but the storyline is great for a fantasy!
B00F034OXQ|4.0|I absolutely love Jack Johnson. I have listened to this cd several times and I hear something new each time.
6305537798|5.0|10 Things I Hate About You is a finely crafted and well-acted masterpiece in the teen movie genre. The young actors in this comedy play their updated Shakespeare-inspired characters well, and help explain the Bard to a younger generation in a much easier and less \\"Thou-filled\\" manner.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie was released at a time when a lot of teen movies were coming out, and all of the movies seemed to have a common thread of a guy getting paid to take out a girl (or betting on dates). At that time it seemed a bit annoying, but now, it's just cool that so many were released because it gives teens a better selection. 10 Things is definitely one of the best selections that a teen (or a person of any age) could make.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I have only played two games but I enjoyed playing the game and seeing a picture revealed.  I love the challenge to this old brain..
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Lots of fun but the game, (like all other games) is designed to make money. You will need more gems and coins then you think and they are quite expensive. It can be very addictive and time consuming. I would give it more than 3 stars but with the constant need of coins, gems and adding new friends, I just can't.
1476733953|5.0|Story reads like a post apocalyptic adventure. Plot twists and thrills kept me fascinated.  Great character development made you feel attached to characters. My husband and I could not stop reading. At the end of the novel we spent all day and most that night reading it. It was just that good. I think this might turn into a movie someday.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|My husband loves this app! He uses it on our kindle fire HD and it works well. He loves the auto scroll.
0062280228|4.0|I liked it. Something about it reminded me of a Miyazaki movie. Cute kid stumbles into a world with witches and monsters. The ending was a slight let down but it did leave some to the imagination.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Love, love, love!  A gem in young adult literature.  A book not to be missed by a girl of any age.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|Always fun to shoot fake guns. When I have a conversation with the cuckoo and I am a bit of my brother was young and old school of lately.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Very long, yet amazingly detailed and amazing. Yes, it had it's down times where it seems as if the book will never speed back up, but that just makes the up Tempo parts that much more interesting and anticipated! Would definitely recommend to any (mature) audience (sex,words, etc), but I am definitely looking forward to getting the next book, then the next 2 GRRM is making after that!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|Lots of fun, for kids and adults too. Very simple controls. My 4 and 6 year old love it! After several weeks it is still a go to game for them.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|It's is one of his best, even if it was the first one. Nobody will be disappointed. Go ahead and read it....
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very well written, looking forward to the movie. Hope it can hold up. A little warning, I thought this was something aimed towards children in upper elementary school and middle school. However, there are some instances that might not be best for them. Always love science fiction, and if you lie sci fi, definitely consider!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Not a huge science fiction reader but this one got me! A must read! Will definitely look into authors other writings.
B008MM9630|4.0|A cute and well designed game to help you relax. Easy gameplay and many variations. No internet needed is a big pro. ....give it a try!
B0053O89JM|5.0|I remember seeing the last episode of this great series and how exciting it was.  My husband did not get to view many of the last episodes so I have purchased this set to give him as a gift at Christmas.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Got this for free an tried it for a little while. Absolutely loved the prediction and autocomplete modes but the app itself is kinda heavy. It made my phone really slow and the ram signature is very big. Had to uninstall to make my phone usable again. If that problem is fixed this will be a 5 star app. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 Int. version
B0057LUI0O|5.0|I love it and my kid absolutely loves it! He has watched it non stop for the last week. It's great entertainment - expect for that Nigel bird but I love it  - Plus it's about a Brasilian Bird - Eu amei
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Read both books and they are amazing,, cant wait for another one. Its like a mixture between the hunger games and the bachelor.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|At first I was sciptical of this movie, but turned out to be really great and full of twist, nad suprise ending. I would highly recommend to watch.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Amazing book could not put it down all the little kiddy nightmares are real !!!! Quiet well priced as well
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This show was well done and for a cange a different perspective on how Zombies affected toher people. I highly recommend to watch.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Just an extremely interesting storyline that drew me in quick! Did nothing one weekend but read, read, read this trilogy!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|This is another good Die Hard full of action and supence, but it's the the typical Die Hard and not much of a story line. Alot of shooting and explosion,but still greta to watch.
0802473156|5.0|I like this book so much that it has become one of my standard wedding gifts -- it helped my family understand the way we think so much better.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|My wife and my self really ejoyed this classic fairy tale revamped to modern age. It was fun and full of action. Would not recommend for little children.
B00AYB0YFQ|2.0|it is neither funny or scary. i waste 1 hour watching this movie, then switch to another better foreign movie.
B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|This was a grest story and had lots of action involved in it. This is diffently not for little children to watch, but greta if your looking for something action packed.
B008OW1SAC|5.0|Alt-J is amazing, and this vinyl pressing has worked swimmingly for me for months, even on my crappy Crosley. I definitely recommend it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love that you can tailor the game to user's age. it takes a while to download, but once that's done it's a fun game
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Good love story and learned we all struggle with adversity  food for thought about end of life decisions. I would highly recommend
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This was an awesome movie, I wish I would have just bought it instead of renting it. Would definitely  recommend this.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie. Very entertaining. Comical too. It brings you back to that era in time. Will watch it again.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|These zombies are actually scary.  They are fast and intelligent.  What a great movie.  I can't wait to read the book :)
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|Dave Grohl has taken the time and energy to produce a documentary that is a beautiful memorial to the end of REAL music. Dave tells the story of Sound City studios, a Van Nuys recording studio where many amazing sounding albums were made. Dave turned out purchasing the sound mixer, and recorded an album with some of the performers that also recorded there. The music is real and raw and wonderful sounding.<br /><br />If you like Rock music this is a really great movie, Dave is one talented guy. Have to admit though, I went to high school with Georg (AKA Pat Smear), and I am so envious of his relationship with Nirvana and Foo Fighters! How awesome his life must have been! Mine, not so awesome, LOL. Very cool movie, highly recommended.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Tucker & Dale vs Evil is hilarious. A new twist to college kids in the woods prusued by murderous rednecks. The kids think Tucker and Dale are the worst kind of killers, but the opposite is true. They are just two good ole country boys trying to fix up an old shack in the woods, then one night while fishing on the lake, one of the college girls dives in and knocks herself out on a rock. They rescue her and take her back to their cabin. The remaining students think she has been kidnapped and try to mount a rescue. Their efforts result in their own deaths, and Tucker and Dale can't understand why these college kids keep killing themselves on their property. The arrival of the local sheriff complicates the situation. This is so funny, I watched it four time on netflix and finally decided to buy it. Try it you will laugh yourself out of your chair.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book. Has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. It all ends up making sense in the end and shows the things we do for love.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I just wanted to say that you don't have to like Tool to enjoy this dark ride of excellent songs.<br />Tool for me is overblown and lacks that emotional thing he achieves here.<br />this record feels so real,so experienced.<br />I saw them on this tour and wow!<br />I'm just a big fan of this period in MJK's artistic life.
B00A7KKPDK|5.0|If you love Ellen, then you will love this book. It is a very fast read and you will laugh. I could not put it down and will pass it on to someone else who loves Ellen. It is nice to have a light read and laugh!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it<br />Wish it keep going-can't wait for more room very challenging<br /><br />My son loves it too. As well as other family
B0057R5G6E|5.0|Any movie fan, even someone who hates these movies, will love these movies. THEY ARE SO AWESOME! Did you see the part where they were all like &#34;oh no, a dinosaur!&#34; then the dinosaur was all &#34;rargh!!!!!!&#34; And then it eats them. My only complaint in these movies is they are running all the time, don't they ever go to the bathroom? Hold on T-Rex.... I gotta pee! I mean there is plenty of dino feces in the movies (I mean who doesn't want that, I wish dino feces were the main plot in EVERY movie) but not enough human feces. Lets try and even that out for the 4th one! Smell that? Oscar season!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Sam Neil as Woolsy is terrific, and the young man  playing Henry is also wonderful.  It irritates me that you have a certain number of words necessary for this review.  Sometimes, &#34; I really loved it&#34; is sufficient.  Many times I can't find the time to write a review when one sentence would suffice, in those instances I just don't send a review.
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|Carcass  doing  what they do best..The instruments have been sharpened and are ready to dissect your rotting corpse with sterile precision...a great album
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|I like the game, the story's premise is interesting, the graphics are good and the minigames are good, but it took FOREVER to download. For that reason I am giving the game only three stars..
B009RX7IX8|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SEASON YET! I CANT GET ENOUGH OF CASTLE!  I WATCH IT OVER AND OVER BECAUSE IT IS JUST THAT GOOD!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fell in love with the characters. The plot of the story was really good. I would recommend this show to my friends.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great read. Nothing like the movie. This was expertly written post war interviews that tell the story of a zombie war we all should prepare for. Highly recommended.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this game made my kids stop what they were doing and play with me.. as a mom I loved seeing them attempt to find the way out. A great use of. their brains!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is easy to use and was useful while I traveled through several countries on 3 continents. The information is very detailed.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I wasn't to sure about this TV show when it first aired and decided not to watch it. Man was i wrong for doing that. I bought the tv series due to the fact I was bored at work and wanted to try a new tv series. This show is great!!!! Even though this aired on the same station as smallville. This show is no smallville...Its even better and a much darker DC comic book series. There are a lot of cool twist to this show and it is a must watch for any DC comic book fan. This is a dark comic book series with some hints of humor on the way. I cant wait for season 2 to start in October. I highly recommend this show!!!!!
B000001Y5X|5.0|From the manic whirlwind Prelude to the shocking Cake and Sodomy, Portrait of an American family is an album that stands on its own two feet as being catchy and memorable. Cake and Sodomy dishes out the obscene gestures, Lunchbox is told with a twist of humor, Organ Grinder is pleasing vocally, Cyclops is addictingly wild, Get your gunn is catchy (if not overly insulting), Dope Hat is great and fierce, and My Monkey is hysterically enjoyable. Snake Eyes and Sissies is another winner, easy to get lost in. The rest all work to varying degrees, though not as appealing. Every song on this album is worth listening to, from fast paced and rock style to techno overload.
0811821846|5.0|This book is great! Lots of Puns on the Stars Wars, amazing for boys who want to get into cooking with out &#34;girly&#34; cookbooks.  Got this for a 7 year old who has been recently watching Star Wars.  He loves it!  I thought it was hilarious too.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|They aren't kidding with all these featurettes, photso, interviews, various EVERYTHING. All you wanted to know on these films has been covered and yes, really, you DO get about 50 hours of entertainment watching these. From reading the scripts, to acting out takes, the behind the scenes stories, this set is worth it for ANY Alien fan!<br /><br />People have said they would have liked a bit more juicy stuff concerning Alien3, and I do agree that Fox screwed us over a little bit on that regard. However, it's definitely not enought to take away any points when you see the rest of this fan's dream come true. I enjoyed all the movies to an extint, part 4 being by far the least enjoyed. The first was horrifying, the second perfectly action-packed, the third dark and depressing (but fantastic), and the fourth a major let down that changed the formula. Still, I didn't \\"hate\\" it.<br /><br />All in all I have never seen this much effort put into a set. Especially to make 2 different versions of each, and the little bonus book was great fun as well =)<br /><br />Some have complained on the packaging...well, I can see where it *IS* annoying getting dvds out of the plastic containers from time to time. I see this in most DVDs I buy now though. It wasn't anything different in the way they make individual or box cases.And I actually liked how they did the fold out. Unrolling something that keeps going and going and making your friends and familys mouths DROP is always worth a good time =)<br />I wasn't crazy about some of the artwork on the box, but then again some of it still blew me away.<br /><br />Those are the only complaints I have found out of hours and hours of Alien history.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Top-notch, as always - watching this series never gets old - the characters are so interesting it's addicting! Love it!  A+
0780626966|5.0|Although the DVD is lower on the standards of some others, it should be remember that this one was released when DVD was brand spanking new, and that at the time it was seriously pushing the limits. Even if you keep its age in check, this is still one of the supreme examples of how to do a box set. My Walmart is still selling this set, and they never do that with DVD releases this old. The movies have their ups and downs, my favorite being the first, third, and seventh. 6th is the only one I truly hate and despise.<br /><br />While the DVDs themselves don't offer many extras, except perhaps part 1 and some of 4, the nightmare encyclopedia dvd more than makes up for any qualms. This thing will take hours to get through (if you ever make it that is, it's hard) as well as countless music videos, interviews, clips, mtv hosting, behind the scenes stuff, pictures, trailers and amazing DVD menu design.<br /><br />Overall I have faults with it (such as how annoying it is that it sends you all the way to the beginning if you miss a beat, or that using the control gets really old. I would have also liked seeing more extras on the discs themselves instead of divided so much.) but because of sheer effort and blood,sweat, and tears alone - I couldn't just give this one four stars.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|This was the first 3D movie I had seen. It was great and since have bought a few more to go with it
0140177396|5.0|Wow - how tragic.<br /><br />This emotionally stunning book has become a classic for good reason. Steinbeck employs a direct, everyday language, keeping the point at all times, using only scenes which enhance the main moral (or immoral depending how you see it) messages, and while this tale is not fiercely fast-paced, it is always riveting, always important.<br /><br />Characterization is powerful, yet this is a plot-focused story rather than a character-focused one. The goal is to be realistic about the men and not necessarily to get you to like any of them much. The more sympathetic of the group is the tragic Lennie, who's low IQ and mental incompetence results in him accidentally screwing about everything up. People, typically with low tolerance and quick judgement and blood-thirst, fail to understand the scope of his childlike limitations as he innocently attempts functioning in a depressing, adult world.<br /><br />George, always the caregiver of Lennie, has average intelligence. Both men work hard to get little in life. They're both stuck within their own mental, class and societal limitations. The book is driven by George's promise to always take care of Lennie, that one day soon they will get their own place, a place with animals and peace. For a time George himself may even believe this, as do many of the men who want to join in their dream. Some are skeptical, some just as joyfully hopeful as Lennie, which is even more depressing.<br /><br />It seems some hold issues about Curley's wife, that she didn't even have a name, and that she was referred to as the husbands property in a way. She was also shown as being manipulative, sluttish, and dishonest. However, I think Steinbeck did this not to disrespect women but to emphasize the story's larger moral message. They were all stuck, for different reasons, in their roles they couldn't climb out of. On the other side of the coin, the negative aspects of her personality helped Steinbeck also showcase his other point - others messing with Lennie, innocent Lennie, and resulting in tragedy as they interact with him.<br /><br />It is not just she who is a victim, but all of them. The focus is this, not repression of only one minority.<br /><br />I consider Of Mice and Men an anti-change book. This is especially interesting since almost all novels embrace change and the wonders, miracles, and plot-forward propelling aspects of it. Here Steinbeck is showing that the American dream was NOT obtainable by everyone, that the speech that all could climb up and have their own home and dreams was not accurate for the lower level working man. Despite hard work, saving what could be saved, and struggle, it could not always be dished out to everyone.<br /><br />Despite all their attempts, and that they have dreamed their entire lives for the same thing, they could not always get the dream. Some lost hope completely long ago, but other characters had a rekindling of it and tried yet again.<br /><br />It could at first be argued about George changing with how it ended with Lennie during the last chapter, but with deeper inspection it proved still the same, no change. George kept his promise to always take care of Lennie the best he could, to protect him, despite whatever circumstances life threw his way.int - others messing with Lennie, innocent Lennie, and resulting in tragedy as they interact with him.<br /><br />It is not just she who is a victim, but all of them.

B008JFUO36|5.0|While this is a pretty basic science fiction story I found it surprisingly fascinating. I even enjoyed the ending, which surprised and delighted me. Without spoiling the story line let me just say this guy is not what we have come to expect from this genre. While searching for answers amid loss and betrayal he is as confused as any one would be. The choices he is forced to make are thought provoking and heartbreaking. With as much action as anyone could wish for there are many levels to the future depicted here. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would tell anyone to give it a chance.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I can not stop playing. This is a cute game but a lot of fun. I love that the minions can change outfits, but I have a hard time getting around the tall lasers.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is a great app.  You can set alarms, or do countdown.  (My kids already have a countdown to Christmas.)  Much used in out house.
B00EZZ77ZM|4.0|I love Jack Johnson! In Between Dreams remains my favorite album, but this one is great! If you love Jack, you won't regret this purchase!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was so excited to get this Media Player.  However, my excitement soon turned to frustration.  After several hours of trying to connect with my Kindle HD I called KIndle and was told that it was not compatible with the Chromecast.  I then tried to connect with my labtop.  This to was not fruitful. I called Google and requested help.  After about an hour of talking to someone on the telephone I was told that he really could not help me.<br /><br />So, after having the devise for over a month Ihave still not able to get it to work.  A real disappointment.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Recorded the old fashioned way on analog recording tape (ATR Magnetics USA) with the musicians all present and working together makes this album a Blast from the Past. Even the jacket replicating a 1&#34; reel of master tape is awsome!<br />Thanks to Grohl the custom &#34;Neve&#34; mixer lives on. Lets be honest, our world is analog and we hear analog not digital. Anyone can compose music on a computer with little or no talent but true musicians get together in a studio and jam!<br />Sound City, Thats It Man!
0920668372|5.0|Has been a family favorite for 25 years. It is a book always given at a baby shower. Circle of life
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A pretty depressing book and starts out slow but all worth it in the end.  Some really poignant lines and lessons.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|Saw a link to this book on a website I have no recollection of, however, while deployed to Afghanistan I was able to conduct an experiment using Tim Ferriss' guide on a two of my Soldiers and myself while we were in a controlled environment.  The rapid weight loss worked wonders on one (he lost about 35 lbs in 8 weeks); the other actually gained weight (about 5 lbs), and I lost 25 lbs in the same amount of time.  I would argue the jury is still out on whether or not this diet / life style will actually work for anyone.  Truth is, everybody is different.  You have to figure out what works for you and go for it.  If what you're doing isn't working, change.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this series and could not wait until the next<br />episode.  I do not like to watch nudity so I was put off by that, but I could<br />fast forward or just not watch. I look forward to watching season 3.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I'm still trying to finish it! I made it to &#34;Epilogue&#34;. Just when I want to quit I'll figure out another step. Sure hope I'll get to the end!!
B008JFUO36|3.0|The special effects were great but ultimately it was a disappointment!  They needed a better story teller to tell the tale!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works very very well and is very efficient and I think it is amazingly amazing so that is my opinion.
B000NH7SZ0|4.0|it is all about speed I needed this for my brothers laser printers. you have a short list of memory that will work in these printers and this was the best priced. works flawlessly and the seller got me the product in a timely manner (quite quickly actually well done)  and at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />GOOD JOB
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's something I use on long road trips or even just to pass the time at home. I love horses so this is just my kind of game. The only down point of this game is using so much energy to complete training for competitions.
B005U9RE1Y|1.0|It was not what I expected. I was trying to teach my juniors about the complications of a Labyrinth and it didn't do what I had wanted.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Excellent and addictive game. Only complaint is you can't read the word you get wrong in the yellow theme because the letters are yellow. Please fix
B00A5IWS5M|4.0|It is one of the weirdest movies I have every seen. It is also very inventive and disturbing. Only David Lynch could pull this off.

0375869026|5.0|I read this with my middle schooler to support his summer prep for Fall classes at his new private middle class.  We LOVED the story.  Will make you cry, laugh, sigh, and want to remember why the human spirit is worth protecting.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|the game requires you to rate it to complete a task.  Also requires you to like on facebook and twitter.  This is ok I guess.  You get diamonds so that is cool.<br />Biggest problem is that I am having a hard time getting the review to &quot;submit&quot;.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing Flow. It starts out easy, and gets progressively more challenging, building on what you've learned before, so that you continue to succeed. I played Bridges, an offshoot of Flow, with my gamer 19 &amp; 23 year old kids thinking they would think it was easy, but they also found it challenging.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Really cool creative new obstacles,characters, and scenery.  I am a big fan of Angry Birds...and this is the best one yet. Graphics are awesome, game play is great.  A couple things I don't like : the little icons over each birds head to tell u what he does.  They also give you hints when u should touch the screen after you shoot.  Totally unnecessary!!! When u get a new character it shows you how to use it in a short pictorial.....  That's all we need !!! Unless they expect a bunch of senior citizens to be playing the game there is no need for the rest of it.  It's really not that difficult to figure out how to use each bird, and remember what each one does. This feature should be like an idiot mode that you can switch off. But other than that this game rocks.  Well done Anger Bird Team....just loose the &quot;F&quot;-tard features
0804148937|2.0|5 stars if all you want is a mindless entertaining beach read. I did think the depiction of prison life was interesting. But the plot is unbelievable as many reviewers have pointed out. I'm talking fantasy land. Worse yet, I didn't really like our guy enough to root for him. I guess Grisham wanted to give Bannister some moral points by suddenly making him a concerned Virginia environmentalist near the end, when all you got from the rest of the novel was that Bannister is for Bannister. Pulp fiction.
B00009NHC5|5.0|I was expecting it to be a little below the acting standards of today and was pleasantly surprised. It was well-written, gripping and a delight to watch. It had me getting up from the couch and walking around to get rid of the nervous energy I felt FOR the character. I recommend this to EVERYONE; particularly those who enjoy character driven movies with thematic suspense!<br /><br />Great job! Even my oldest brother was amazed at how well the acting was done, and how engaging the storyline was.

B00E193TM2|5.0|In my opinion, this album is amazing. Hard, loud, yet very well executed. The guest vocals are awesome and help make the album what it is. To hear Ivan sing with some of the greats on this album is mind blowing. I'm not sure why some of the bands fans are not \\"satisfied\\" with this album, but if you still love the Five Finger Death Punch sound and feeling, get this F'in album. Period.
B005J4A8AY|2.0|I already had Season 1, but purchased this because of the promise of the 'Zombie Mask' and I liked the packaging.  Zombie mask is brown & black - no blood.  Packaging is extremely flimsy.  It arrived caved in and torn when I opened the shipping box.  Now it won't even stand up properly - it leans.  I had to stuff the mask back in the box just to get the effect of the front flaps opening!  Definitely not worth what I paid for it.

B00DG86ARK|5.0|If you are familiar with Anathema's recent work, you know what to expect with this.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too many details on the set list to avoid spoilers for people who don't like to know the set list before watching the first time.  Let's just say that you will be happy with the selections if you are a fan of everything they've done from Judgement on.<br /><br />The performance, production quality, camera angles, venue, etc. are all top notch.  It is great to see Anathema doing well enough in their career at this point to pull off something like this.<br /><br />Regarding the orchestra, they mostly provides subtle accompaniment.  Don't get me wrong.  The orchestra is there and provides a great addition to Anathema's sound but this isn't like Metallica S&M where the orchestra is very prominent in the mix.<br /><br />One warning -- it is stereo audio.  There is no 5.1 mix.  I thought this was odd given the production quality otherwise but it is what it is.  The stereo audio sounds great on my system so I'm not complaining.<br /><br />In short -- this is a must-have for any Anathema fan.

1400069742|4.0|&#34;Those Angry Days&#34; by Lynne Olson is a very enjoyable read. Her book describes the 1930s when many Americans were instinctively isolationist and considered what was happening in Europe to be none of their business. Most people are aware of America's reluctance to participate in World War II, but the ferocity of the debates over entering World War II have largely been forgotten. The historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. has stated that it was the &#34;most savage political debate in my lifetime,&#34; eclipsing those over McCarthyism and Vietnam in its intensity.<br /><br />Many Americans felt that their country had been conned into WWI by clever British propaganda. American isolationists were probably right that Germany had been badly treated by the allies at Versailles. The punishment that was imposed just invited the Germans to seek revenge. Hitler was elected to reverse the wrongs of Versailles, and his plan involved war. Nazism unleashed a new kind of evil, that Americans were slow to grasp<br /><br />Opponents to the war included: Henry Ford, Joseph P. Kennedy (JFK's father), Wall Street Journal, Harvard Crimson, Chicago Tribune, America's communists, and numerous senators. Supporting them was a grass-roots student organization called the America First Committee, born at Yale University its supporters included JFK, Gerald Ford, and Sargent Shriver.<br /><br />The British were unpopular in most parts of the country, but they did have some supporters. These were mostly east-coast Anglophiles and Wall Street millionaires. The interventionist counterpart of America First was the Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies. Headed by newspaper editor William Allen White, it employed writer Robert Sherwood and Adlai Stevenson to influence public opinion. In government, the interventionists were supported by Secretary of War Henry Stimson. After visiting Europe in 1941, Wendell Willkie, the Republican presidential candidate in 1940, campaigned for Americans to be conscripted and trained for war and for Britain to be sent aid.<br /><br />Charles Lindbergh was Roose­velt's most troublesome opponent and a lot time is spent examining his character and motivations. Lindbergh told Americans that Britain was finished and the US should befriend the Nazis. He claimed that the real enemy was internal and Jewish. Lindbergh comes across as clueless and unlikeable. We learn that he later fathered seven children by three different German women.<br /><br />Olson focuses on US views and politics so Germany's war aims are not explained. Mein Kampf and its sequel Zweites Buch, show that Hitler's long term objective was world domination. Hitler considered the US Germany's most powerful long term rival. None of the Americans described by Olson who opposed the war, including Lindbergh, seemed aware of Hitler's ambitions. Unfortunately, Olson does not discuss them either.<br /><br />Olson is pro-British and criticizes Roosevelt for being led by public opinion polls. She  believes that Roosevelt was too timorous and should have done more to help Britain earlier. However, Roosevelt was a canny politician and probably knew what he was doing. Germany declared war on America after Pearl Harbor. According to Olson, without Hitler's intervention it is likely that the US would have focused its attention on defeating Japan rather than assisting Britain. Britain and Russia would have been left to fight the war in Europe mostly on their own. Unfortunately there is no discussion of Roosevelt's war aims.<br /><br />Olson also reports that numerous high-ranking officers in the Army, Navy and Army Air Corps sought to sabotage Roosevelt efforts to help Britain. I was surprised by the pro-German sympathies of many senior military commanders, including George Marshall. After the war Marshall admitted that he regretted the pre-war Anglophobia of the US military. Olson writes about General Albert Wedemeyer, the author of the Victory Plan, which served as the basis for US strategy in the war. He spent time in Germany before the war and viewed the Slavs as an inferior race.  Wedemeyer didn't like Jews either and was sympathetic for the German need for lebensraum (living space).<br /><br />Olson points out that had Hitler not declared war on the United States, after Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt would have focused America's resources on defeating Japan. Britain would have been fighting a two front war on its own. Olson states that Churchill declared war on Japan after Pearl Harbor and this was unnecessary. She does not seem aware that on the same morning as the attack on Pearl Harbor, forces of the Empire of Japan invaded the British colony of Hong Kong.<br /><br />The book is well written book and it tells a fascinating story. However, it is popular history and is aimed at the general reader rather than academics.and viewed the Slavs as an inferior race.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great story.  But even with careful investments in thought control, some of our distant dystopian posterity become incorrigible potty mouths.  Other than that, every word rings true.  I was riveted by the story, characters, and vision of Wool.  As thought provoking and eye-opening as anything I've read.  it makes you wonder not just about the story but yourself and your place in the world.  How do our choices impose on our children and their children? How much of our path did our ancestors choose for us?  Can children ever escape the sins of their fathers?  And one of the biggest questions of all:  Hugh Howey, what did IT ever do to you?<br /><br />Thank you for a wonderful read.

B007XF0X6G|4.0|I took a chance and saw Wrath of the Titans. I say took a chance because I saw Clash of the Titans (2010) and I felt it was just terrible. Well, this time I was pleasantly surprised. This movie had a good storyline, lots of  action, and some really effective C.G.I. Is it perfect? no but all in all I can say that I watched the movie far more than my watch. If you haven't seen it ,give this one a try.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Although I am currently stuck on a level, I still play and enjoy it. It's not only addicting, but entertaining. Great way to just chill out.

B004742Y68|5.0|This movie is still awesome after all these years! The effects are a bit dated but the movie is perfect!
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a great movie! Thanks to the composers and editors that realize the impact of music in the movies and sharing it in a form that allows us to close our eyes and remember our favorite parts!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very enjoyable book.  I found it hard to put down. The caricatures were well defined, you felt like you really knew them.  It made you think what would you do if you were in there position.  This was a real thought provoking story.  I am anxious to here what my friend think of this book!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars except the ending went on and on... but it's fabulous fiction set in North Korea.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Very simple premise, but with good execution and a film that understands exactly what it's delivering, that's not a bad thing. More satire and commentary from the source would make this a 5 star for sure. Still, just a good action movie with pretty good acting throughout.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|And he doesn't disappoint with this one! &#34;Ordinary&#34; magic, ethereal monsters, endearing characters. I would highly recommend it to Gaiman fans.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I dismissed this movie as soon as I saw the open scene of the preview, but this movie was done very well.  The movie is done very well and it reflects the feel of the comic greatly.  I'm not a comic book fan, but enjoy some comic book based movies and this is definitely a good one.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is an amazing series! MOST amazing is how each and every show ends at the perfect intersection...always leaving you wanting more yet blown away by what you have watched!

B002QRWJA4|5.0|Highly recommended to anyone even for those have watched the live Opera. Will be watching it a few more times again!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this read very much; however the end bothers me a little bit.  I was hoping to get more understanding, but the end seemed to have allowed another possibility that was never explained.  Overall, the book was great.  Very easy to read and the issues are made very clear.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|The movie looked great, although it had a few too many slow-mo scenes.  The actors were clearly into what they were doing.  But it was like a giant pinwheel; they had voice-over scene, then an action scene, then a talking scene, and then they just spun those in a circle and watched the same three scenarios fly by over and over again.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|The book had no plot and made no sense.  I couldn't decide if it was sci-fiction, Horror tale or written by a person who lived in a dream world, or should I say nightmare world.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is so awesome I could play the game all day if I could but too bad I cant
B000OXHRRC|4.0|This is a lovely movie to watch with a group.  It takes place in a great French villa, and is a delightful light love story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The way this author writes made me feel like I was inside of the story watching it unfold. I could not put it down. I loved it!
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|An unusually entertaining book - something we don't usually find in the IT industry - it was possible to read it cover to cover.  Of course I will go back to some of the concepts mentioned, as I did not have a &#34;business case&#34; in mind for them all.  However, I will know exactly where to go when the requirement is there.<br />Onwards now to the books from Chris Webb and &#34;the Italians&#34;!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I finally broke down and bought it because, just as I like to see 'To Kill a Mockingbird' once a year, this has become one of those movies for me.  I didn't realize how outstanding Julia Child was before I saw this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game!  The level of difficulty is just right; the game is challenging, but not frustrating. I actually find it relaxing as you get to explore the room at your own pace and are able to inspect items and revisit places as many times as you need to. The game currently has 10 levels or rooms; I can't wait for more rooms to be available. Love it!!!

0345803485|2.0|A friend of mine recommended this book very highly.  She said it was all about sex and thought I would love it.  Right from the beginning I wondered how this book could have been a bestseller.  If you can respect a story about a 22 year old college graduate who will submit to all sorts of sexual humiliations for the love of a handsome and rich man, then you will love this.  I found it insulting to women.  The woman in this story will stoop to almost anything to have fantastic sex.  She decides she will not stand for it and then melts into Christian's arms as he makes love to her.  That is the entire plot.  As others have said, who in their right mind wrote this book?  If this is the quality of reading  that entertains most Americans, I fear for this country.  Not recommended.
159514188X|2.0|I enjoyed it but that's because i was just desperate for something to read. It was interesting but I didn't truly fall in love with any characters.
B008Y78M60|5.0|I knew practically nothing about this part of the assassination. Found it fascinating...and it is prompting me to read more, really enjoyed this fictional but very intriguing piece of history!

B001UTW7QU|5.0|My wife got me to watch the first couple of episodes and at first I was put off by the pseudo science. However, I was soon sucked in by the characters and the evolving story line. I am now half way through season three and this is my go-to &#34;comfort&#34; TV show. (Especially now that Breaking Bad is coming to an end). Highly recommended to those who enjoy lots of plot twists and excellent (if somewhat  odd) characters.

B000ICKPOQ|5.0|best show ever. i think ever one should watch it at least once. the story line is gold. must watch.
B0091VTISO|3.0|Nice cast line up.  However, the scenes turned characters into cookie cutter roles sometimes.  Over all OK entertainment for a quiet evening at home. I wouldn't compare the versions as Schwarzenegger is pretty bad and his acting has always been bad.
B00D3NSDVO|4.0|Hayes has done some pretty good screenplays.<br />His novel is pretty good too. I felt a little like he threw everything - including the kitchen sink - into it, though. But his protagonist is one of those smart, intuitive guys, a little like Jack Reacher.<br />Hayes tells a good story. I look forward to the next one.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was so surprised when I finished reading the hunger games. As a certified lefty living in Alabama, I often despair that our kids aren't being taught how to think critically about what adults (politicians, teachers, preachers, parents, etc.) tell them. And then I heard my daughter and her friends talking about these books.<br /><br />*sigh* Thanks, Suzanne Collins. You snuck deep thinking into redneck Alabama, and no one is the wiser. ;-)<br /><br />This last one is the best, by the way! Make sure you finish the series before the other movies come out! The first movie did follow the book fairly well, but the books are so well-written that they really should be required reading for middle to high school students. The message has the potential to be lost amidst the visually stunning movie. Let the kids (and adults!) imagine the horrors themselves first. They'll get the picture.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This author has a way of writing that not only enables the reader to see the scene, become evolved with the characters but you feel, smell, hear everything as if you were part of the action.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first I thought this was another yuppy marriage trouble blah blah blah story. And then there are hints of...questions...it couldn't be, could it? Wait...and then...<br /><br />BAM. Amy starts narrating. And you can't help but sneer.<br /><br />You will change your mind about the characters over and over again...your head will be spinning by the time you finish this book. Keep reading. It WILL be worth it.<br /><br />Artful.

B00EEN7CAK|5.0|Marc (Israel Broussard) is the new kid in school. He is an average guy who is befriended by the light fingered Rebecca (Katie Chang). He goes along with her antics as he gets to hang out with her, her hot friends, and do drugs. It isn't long before things escalate as their inner circle of friends desire to partake in the robbing of celebrities.<br /><br />The celebrities post their schedule so everyone knows when they are out of town. Using Google and Google Earth their homes are easy to pinpoint and it seems their security is less than my broken window double-wide guarded by feral kittens.<br /><br />The film, like the event, makes a statement about when consumerism and celebrity society collide. I found the movie amusing in that regard. After they rob Paris Hilton for the third time, someone asks, &#34;Won't she know?&#34;<br /><br />Someone answers, &#34;She's Paris.&#34;<br /><br />When Rebecca gets arrested she asks, &#34;Did you talk to any of the victims?&#34;<br /><br />Officer: &#34;I talked to all the victims.<br /><br />Rebecca: &#34;Really? What did Lindsey say?&#34;<br /><br />It is a film that is hard not to like while shaking your head. The production could have been better if the celebrities who were robbed played the kids who robbed them and they diss themselves. I found the movie entertaining and enjoyable.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, brief near sex, no nudity. Emma Watson showing off a great set of gams.<br /><br /> I loved it, if you didn't.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|A great series... The last one felt kind of lacking, but nothing like it on earth.. Truly innovative ideal...<br /><br />A travesty NetFlix doesn't even have it... A year after I called about.. So I figure, why not buy the entire &#34;cult&#34; trilogy in Blue Ray
B00F91RYL8|1.0|I should have turned it off right at the start.  Yay! Another zombie movie where a virus is responsible and this time its a magical virus that does the impossible and takes over a host in seconds.  It is an insult to your intelligence.  Whoever wrote this pile of garbage could have at least found an undergrad in the biological field in college and asked if it was even remotely possible which it isn't.  Then enter the main character who has a vague and hackneyed backstory.  Oh yay another mysterious ex-special forces guy who is the only one who can save the world.  I am not even sure if Brad Pitt is acting in this one.  It is almost like he is aware that this pile of crap is just out to make a quick buck off star power so he is just going through the motions.  There was absolutely no character development.  No story development just scene to scene of &#34;action&#34; with disappointing results.  Then we get to an ending with a plan to beat the zombies which is just stupid.... I mean stupid.  They do a quick recap of maybe everyone it going to die maybe not... the end.  The zombies weren't even scary... more annoying with their high pitched wailing than frightening.<br /><br />TERRIBLE.. don't watch.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Great read. It kept me interested every step along the trail! Highly recommended! Makes me want to get back into hiking the Appalacian Trail.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game, requires patience but a lot of fun. You have to use coins to get coins! Up to level 51
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I recommend this to all.  This product revolutionized the way I watch YouTube and Netflix.  I control them via my Samsung Galaxy S4  and that is way easier to use than my TV remote!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Purchased this DVD for my home gym set up / 7 channel Denon with Klipsch speakers 52 in plasma .<br />The sound & video are superb , the show is beyond my expectations & then some . Out of 5 I give 7 rating .<br />The depth of talent on stage is world class with Stuart Mathewman leading the way . Arrangements are extremely well thought out . Sade 's voice has a wonderful range & comes through perfectly . Buy it , you will not be disappointed .
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I always use Google for my work.  I can always find what I need using it.  I know there are other search engines out there, but I have never  been successful using anything else.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|The movie was kind if strange but it was surprisingly funny. I've found myself playing this movie when I have nothing to do or as background noise, good audio tracks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|ok...the season ended tragically and took me awhile to get over that...however, the season as a whole was awesome!  Love it!
B0085OELXK|5.0|Very exciting story line..I love Matt Damon in these kind of roles. There is a nice twist in this film
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I was very disappointed! Loved the first two... This one, not so much. I did not like how Katniss's future ended up.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Great for the purpose for which it was design for... It's the best one on the market, and it works
B004J64QSI|4.0|This is the cast that started it all. Definitive tenor lead and interesting interpretation of Javier by Roger Allam. Original cast brings out religious over tones of the show.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Have to know what makes Christian the way he is. Makes him intriguing on so many levels, deliciously mysterious.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|there is only one reason I give it 4 stars<br /><br />The reason is even though its a good no great game its always cutting connections with your device and you can hardly ever get on a multieplayer match and when you do its pretty much always almost over<br /><br />But I love the game great FPS and its like TF2 for the kindle fire phone and tablet I phone maybe even a...<br />well its just a great game.<br />I'm 10 and I just think they should really put a story behind the game.<br /><br />GREAT FPS<br />BUT NEEDS A STORY!<br />LOVE IT!
B00DONVMFM|5.0|I missed seeing the 2nd season  before I watched the 3rd season on TV - so it was great fun to go back and fill in all the info that I missed - a lot happened in season 2.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Enjoyable, well-written story. A little twisted psychologically and at times unbelievable but I couldn't put it down. I find a lot of novels to be predictable but not this one. Mind games on steroids. If I had read it before I got married, I'm not sure I'd have gotten married.
B0045XGRQE|4.0|Not as good as the first but much more action! A must see! My four year loved it and he's excited for part 3!
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I like the game, think it's quite fun, but I HATE the ads, they are so annoying! The ads keep cutting off the game and video clips keep popping up. I finally paid to go ad-free and now I'm having fun with the game.
B00E00P5JC|5.0|My wife and I watched Turbo this summer and we loved the movie! I don't why nobody went to see the movie. We don't have any kids and we thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was entertaining, the story line and the humor was funny. The movie deserved more. We felt it was one of the best animated movies of the year! I collect a lot of movies over 2,000 and Turbo will be one of those buys this winter. Watch the movie and you won't be disappointed. It was a pleasant surprise to say the least. It was refreshing and just not one of those sequels like the rest of the bunch.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|I loved the book.  It met my expectations of what life must be like in North Korea...well done! Pulitzer Prize!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love this movie. I watch it whenever I can and I have yet to tire of it. It's overall a funny movie that will always be one of my favorites.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|To keep it short and sweet, the sequel to Star Trek by director JJ Abrams was  entertaining. I agree that the villain help made this movie and that once again the new Kirk and Spock tandem worked here. I look forward to the next movie, even hoping somehow they can bring back some of this magic.
1455526959|5.0|I really like the way Michael Connelly writes. And I enjoy all of his books. I also like the main character.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Shhh! This is a Christmas present for a grandkid, but it surely looks cute and should be a hit when given.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|Simply put, a masterpiece of filmmaking, story telling. Hitchcock is proven by this movie to be the best in suspence
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was an amazing man with an equally wife, Taya. A true patriot, a good husband and father and a warrior. This is a great read and I am just so sorry for his family when he was murdered recently. God bless his family!
B00CHNKJFO|4.0|If you have ever actually played pinball (my favorite was the KISS game at the local roller rink) then this is for you.  The only thing you can't do is bump...  which would be a huge improvement... but the tables offer a lot of bonus features and it was a great way to entertain myself on a long car ride.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The audio quality of these \\"cans\\" is absolutely clear and clean. They're comfortable for wearing for several hours (could be a bit more comfortable, but comfortable enough)and I've taken to wearing them when I watch TV. I have another pair of these for editing.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Hubbs and I are so into this show! We watch it every night almost without fail! Great season 1, season 2 is awesome too!
B004D7GU3M|5.0|This has been heralded as Kanye's greatest album to date, and I find it difficult to disagree. If you're on this page considering a purchase, I'm sure you are already aware of the music itself. As for the vinyl pressing, some other reviewers who claim to be &#34;audiophiles&#34; complain that this was poorly mastered from digital back to analog. I can understand the frustration if they did not receive what they expected, but I have not been able to detect any issues. It sounds great to me, though I'll admit that I don't listen to records for the enhanced sound. I am all about the experience of sitting and enjoying a piece of art in its entirety, and any imperfections in quality that may appear only add character to my experience. $23 for a triple LP is a PHENOMENAL deal. I would buy this album again in a heartbeat.
B008M7JODC|5.0|My hubby and I have started watching it and love it so far! No complaints yet to report. Good Job!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This whole series is so good, it has everything, drama, comedy, suspense, mystery, you are never going to guess what is about to happen next. So sad to see it will be ending in just a few weeks but with this dvd you have it forever.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Flow is a good game, I still remember the first time when I got it on my PSP and how amazing is looks. Flower is a great game. Journey... is the best game I've played in my life.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of WWII.  I really like that the book alternates between the US Airmen experience and the Luftwaffe flyers experience.  The story is well researched and very easy to read.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|Great show. All four seasons are adorable and funny. Comedy, a little fun drama and Vanessa Williams! I really like Betty!
1400034205|1.0|i read maugham's \\"of human bondage\\" about 5 years ago, and although it wasn't exactly to my taste, i really appreciated the pacing and evolution of the main character. might i add that the recent edition of \\"of human bondage\\" is around 700 pages long. this being said, \\"the razor's edge\\" was UNBEARABLE at 314 pages.<br /><br />here are some of the many things i found completely annoying about this book:<br />1) it had sentences that i read, then i reflected, then i read them again and then said to myself \\"that sentence sucked\\"<br />2) it felt like something profound or enlightening was going to happen around every corner, then instead whatever happened sucked.<br />3) there were many statements made in the book that seemed like they had some underlying symbolism, but then i realized, \\"no, this is not that kind of book\\" and dismissed them.<br />4) to reinforce point number 3, there were conversations and observations in this book that just went on forever, and it is almost like one had to sort thorough all these little trivial statements and words to get to the point of what the author was trying to say or depict. it would be a useful talent for one to be able to speed read through this with an adeptitude for mining information like finding a needle in a haystack.  not that this text was dense or hard to read, it was just inflated with lots of words that have no value to the story.<br /><br />i could go on, but i feel that this is enough to make my point for now.<br />when i was trying to \\"power\\" through this 314 page monstrosity, i would try to sit down to read 10 pages in a row,<br />then after 2 pages i would groan and grow angry and want to throw the book because it was so boring and pointless.<br />it was very difficult to get through because it was so utterly unrewarding.<br />the author even tells you about 50 pages to the end that you really shouldn't bother finishing the book you are reading, i wished i had taken his advice.
B00BAXFCPO|3.0|I had originally rated my review with a 2-star rating.  I'm changing this to 3 stars.<br /><br />I am leaving all of my original lengthy posting as-is, which you can read below, if you choose.  I am also leaving all of the extensive comment section as-is.<br /><br />The reason I'm changing my rating to 3 stars is this:  I recently noticed a blog at Dr. Perlmutter's website where he explains that eating a vegetarian or vegan diet is not inconsistent with the diet that he recommends.  I was surprised at this, since the recommendations in his book lean toward the consumption of plenty of animal products -- beef, chicken, cheese and butter.  (I am not vegetarian or vegan myself, but I am close to vegan as I eat only limited amounts of fish and eggs.) I opened the blog and read it, and it still was hard for me to understand because the way I had interpreted Dr. P's book, I thought it would be nearly impossible for a vegan to adopt his recommendations regarding foods to avoid -- and still have enough to eat at all!  And so I posted a question to the blog, and in response, Dr. Perlmutter agreed that eating lentils and beans in moderation (in addition to garbanzo beans, specifically, in any amount) would be healthful.  Vegans could also eat, of course, vegetables, nuts and nut butters, limited amounts of fruits and whatever very small amounts of whole grains are permitted, as reflected in the book.  (However, a video at Dr. Perlmutter's blog says to not eat grains ever; there is quite a bit of inconsistency in his advice, and he doesn't seem quite able to make up his mind.)<br /><br />Regardless of whether this new advice from Dr. P is somewhat modified from that expressed in the book or whether I had misinterpreted the book, this advice convinced me that Dr. P's \\"program\\" can be followed even by those who, for the reasons I discuss below and throughout the comment section, do not believe animal products are healthful, sustainable for the planet, and/or consistent with their feelings regarding animal rights.<br /><br />I still cannot give the book a 4 or 5 rating because I believe it is important for readers and potential readers of Dr. P's book to know that his advice to severely curtail carbs and eat lots of fats continues to be disputed by much of the mainstream medical community (especially by cardiologists and oncologists), including other well known doctor-authors in our popular culture.  There also continues to be considerable disagreement whether animal products (even if from grass-grazed animals)are ever healthful.  But I do believe that acknowledging that a vegan diet can be healthful alleviates any concern that Dr. P. may be \\"in bed\\" with the beef industry and thus lends to his credibility.  I very much appreciate that.  I do recommend Dr. P's book, believe it includes important information not widely disseminated to the general public elsewhere, but only caution that some of the advice remains quite controversial.<br /><br />My original post:<br /><br />I applaud Dr. David Perlmutter's effort to help conquer Alzheimer's and other neurologic disease, from autism to migraines, through the use of nutrition.  Information abounds elsewhere on heart health and cancer nutrition, with little focus on diseases of the brain.  Dr. Perlmutter also brings our attention to the potential dangers of taking daily pills and our nearly century-long experiment of abandoning real food for processed food.  (Unfortunately, he advocates the use of pills that are supplements, which also should be unnecessary for those who have appropriate nutrition.)<br /><br />The gist of Dr. Perlmutter's recommendations is to eliminate sugars, gluten (wheat and barley), and processed foods, and to greatly limit whole carb foods like fruits and whole grains, and also potatoes, beans and lentils.  He also advocates eating more fats from nuts, olive and coconut oil, and avocados, but also from beef, butter and cheese.<br /><br />I compare his book to those of other\\"popular\\" doctors who make names for themselves writing books, appearing on TV, and treating prominent personalities, doctors like Caldwell Esselstyn from the Cleveland Clinic, Dean Ornish, Neal Barnard, Susan Blum, and T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional science professor and researcher.  It is noteworthy that among them, Dr. Perlmutter is the only neurologist.<br /><br />Eliminating sugars, refined wheat products and processed foods from the diet is agreed upon by all.  Dr. Perlmutter's assertions about gluten's adverse affects on the brain are supported by Dr. Blum's warnings about its association with autoimmune disease.  While Dr. Esselstyn, who focuses on heart disease, argues that only small amounts of plant-based fats are required by the body, perhaps he could be convinced to concede a bit on this point, as he seems to have done with regard to people who are not already suffering from heart disease, although the proper amount of fats needed for good health remains in dispute.<br /><br />But what remains most controversial are Dr. Perlmutter's contentions that food products derived from animals are healthy, that saturated fats are necessary, that whole carbs are dangerous, and that high total cholesterol and LDLs are healthy.  Some of the doctors listed above might concede that a little fish and the occasional egg in the diet may be beneficial (though some would not).  One or two of these doctors might sign off on a piece of chicken a couple of times a week.  One or two might be okay with limited amounts of dairy products (though Dr. Perlmutter too restricts milk, for reasons he does not explain well).<br /><br />What I believe is unanimous among the doctors listed above, as well as cardiologists everywhere, if not oncologists, is that the excessive amounts of beef and eggs prescribed by Dr. Perlmutter, the three-times-a-day consumption of animal products, and the elimination of beans, legumes and most whole carbs, are a dangerous prescription for heart healthand cancer prevention, if not also for brain health.  And therein rest the holes in Dr. Perlmutter's hypotheses.  I list below some obvious ones.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter overemphasizes our need to return to the diet of our hunter-gatherer \\"caveman\\" ancestors in order to stave off diseases like Alzheimer's.  Let's return to the non-packaged diet of our grandparents.  But to advocate the \\"caveman\\" (i.e., Paleo) diet is naïve.  Members of today's rare remaining hunter-gather societies who survive infant mortality and childhood disease live on average into their early 50's.  [...] While it's true that our increased life expectancy in the developed world may be nearly entirely attributed to the eradication of infectious disease with antibiotics and vaccines and certain other safety, hygiene, and medical advances, rather than to improvements in our diet, it is also true that \\"cavemen\\" did not live long enough to contract Alzheimer's in their 70's and 80's.  Returning to a caveman diet may argue well for accepting that human beings were simply designed to only live to their 30's-50's and does little to convince those of us who would like to live well into our 90's.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter points out that our caveman ancestors could eat fruit only when it was in season, not every day of the year (implying that we too should not eat it year round), but says nothing of the fact that in the same geographic locations they also would not have had green vegetables all year round (but does not advise us to abstain from greens, ever).  He does not talk about the fact that caveman diets differed in different parts of the world.  Some ate more plant foods than animal foods.  Those who ate animal foods were not \\"hunting\\" primarily for cows but for deer, rabbits, duck, mountain goats, or whatever the locale offered.  The Paleo argument borders on absurdity and does not support a diet based on cows.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter points to the increased consumption of grains during the20th century as a cause for declining health but ignores the exponential increase in the consumption of cheese and beef.  [...]  Moreover, Dr. Perlmutter ignores the diets of modern societies with extraordinarily long life expectancies.  For example, the staple in Okinawa, which enjoys one of the world's longest life expectancies, is the sweet potato, which Dr. Perlmutter shuns.  [...]<br /><br />The Mediterranean diet of residents in Ikaria, Greece is low in dairy and meat and emphasizes potatoes, beans and legumes.  A recent study there revealed residents living 8 to 10 years longer than Americans and suffering only a quarter as much dementia.  [...]  In the \\"Comments\\" section following this review, I have listed a number of other societies as examples, with links to the supporting data.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Dr. Perlmutter's attack on potatoes, whole grains, beans and legumes is unfounded.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter cites a study (Barberger-Gateau, et al.) that he claims supports the notion that people who don't consume Omega-3 rich fish have a higher risk of dementia and Alzheimer's.  The study's actual conclusion was that those who consumed Omega-6 oils without compensating with sufficient Omega-3 oils were at higher risk.  In other words, as long as a person doesn't consume inappropriate Omega-6 rich oils, s/he can be amply healthy without fish.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter's assertions about cholesterol are contested by much scientific literature in addition to many or all of the doctors listed above.  Moreover, Dr. Perlmutter's opinions are positively confusing for the casual reader.  He acknowledges that high oxidized LDL's are unhealthful but gives no advice on how to determine one's oxidized LDL's rather than the LDL levels as presented on common blood test reports.  He believes that total cholesterol should be high, but triglycerides shouldn't be.  But nowhere does he give clear guidance on what ideal cholesterol levels would look like.  He cites a 1994 article (Location 1230, Kindle) that demonstrates that the risk of heart attack with total cholesterol under 200 was as high as for total cholesterol over 240.  In his book on heart disease, Dr. Esselstyn agrees that 200 is not safe but presents evidence instead to support the fact that total cholesterol should be even lower, 150 or less.  And while improving diet before resorting to pills would always make good sense, doctors at Columbia University just this year reiterated the opinion that high LDL's are dangerous, and they continue to believe that statins have saved lives.  [...].  The bottom line here is that the public needs a lot more guidance, untainted by the pharmaceutical industry.  And Dr. Perlmutter should remember that before people worry about getting Alzheimer's in their 70's and 80's, they must survive their 50's and 60's without heart disease and cancer.  His discussions on cholesterol may have some validity, but they are are too confusing to be convincing.  I found Dr. Esselstyn, who has brought heart patients back from the brink of death, to be a lot more convincing.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter advises to eat grass-grazed beef, free-range chickens and wild-caught fish, ignoring the fact that most people can't afford these products, and even if they could, the planet could not sustain a sufficient supply of them.  Even the relatively affluent would be hard-pressed to be able to eat these products three times a day at home and in restaurants.  They're difficult to find, and he offers no alternatives in his menu plans.  It is not clear whether he would favor factory-farmed beef over plant-based proteins like beans, or vice versa, when those are the choices.<br /><br />Dr. Perlmutter ignores the research by T. Colin Campbell at Cornell University, which showed that the protein casein, found in dairy products including milk and cheese, promotes cancer growth.  He also ignores Dr. Campbell's extensive research in rural China during the 1980's that revealed that a plant-based diet with very little animal products resulted in extremely low levels of heart disease and cancer (and total cholesterol in the 120-150 range, without dementia).  A more recent study at Loma Linda University showed that vegetarian and vegan diets were protective against a large number of cancers. [...].  Dr. Neal Barnard's book Power Foods for the Brain presents ample evidence to support the benefit of a plant-based diet for brain health.<br /><br />Finally, Dr. Perlmutter's book does not include sufficient numbers of footnotes, and some of those that he does include reference websites without referencing specific pages, making it all but impossible to find his sources.<br /><br />In summary, I believe that Dr. Perlmutter offers a lot of useful information, and some good advice.  But he concludes his book by saying, \\"It's hard to separate truth from fiction, and to know the difference between what's healthful and harmful...\\"  He's right about that, and his book fails to end the confusion.  I do believe that I learned some useful things from this book and have made slight changes to my diet (which, in my opinion, was already very healthful).  But I can't give the book more than two stars because Dr. Perlmutter's opinions about eating so many cow and chicken products and saturated fats, and cutting out nearly all whole-food carbs, are too controversial to endorse.  It seems that unless and until his theories are better proven, they are too potentially dangerous to follow.<br /><br />It is noted that wherever you see \\"[...]\\" above, I had included links to the supporting documentation for the facts cited.  Apparently, Amazon has bleeped out these links.  I suggest that if you google the subject matter, you will find the supporting studies.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thought this book, was very well written, great story line, & I just loved it.<br />I would highly recommend this book!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This book cannot be put down. Period!<br />If you love fantasy, you cannot let this series go by. It's a very unique story.

B008GXHOFW|4.0|Game is very well developed and is very close in game play to a console game which is very refreshing.
B000094P3P|1.0|My fault for not reading that this was a disk that would not work in my DVD player...would have returned it but I had already opened it
B00CKJ2KK2|3.0|Overall the game is ok, but the movement and aiming are a challenge at times.<br />It is really easy to get lost on the screen the gyroscopic feature on or off.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|So. You want to make a movie? You want to make a really bad, terrible, awful, stupid, rotten movie about star ships? Well, you have a difficult fence to climb. That movie has already been made, my friend. And it is called \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\".<br /><br />If you wish to compete with this cesspool of a movie, you have several challenges to overcome: First you must find a script written by a demented, half-witted sixth grader who does not speak English and who has never, ever seen a good movie, ever in his life. Then, you have to gather together a collection of incompetent, inept, terrible actors: the kind of actors who couldn't get into the third-grade production of Horton Hears A Who, even if they bribed the teacher. Actors who cannot act; actors for whom \\"acting\\" is a completely unfamiliar concept. Third: you have to find a director who is not only a microcephalic mollusk with delusions of sapience, but who also is illiterate, feckless and blind. It is absolutely essential that your director also be a great admirer of Ed Wood, but with far less talent. And finally, it is crucial that you find a special effects master who desires and aspires, above all other things in life, to reach the pinnacle of special effects magic of a blind, spastic, epileptic, bedwetting, drooling lobotomy patient. You put those folks together in combination, and they will make a movie that is at least six hundred and eighty times better than \\"Star Trek: Into Darkness\\". At least. It might even turn out to be six hundred and eighty WARP better.<br /><br />This movie was astoundingly bad. Astoundingly times warp to the googol power bad. Bad. Worse than any bad you can think of. So very, very bad. Really. Bad. Beyond all the bad you have ever seen, imagined, dreamed or contemplated. Bad. Awful. Bad. Seriously. Bad. This movie: very, very, very bad. Really. Bad!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I like games with a storyline and this one is great. I am fast becoming addicted to hidden object games and this one is just involved enough to keep you hooked without being too long. Good job, game creators.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I found this book to be very well-written and thought provoking.  It is refreshing to read a book by someone who ISN'T saying that she has all the answers, just her experiences for what they are worth.
B001U7ADZ4|5.0|This is a great deal for a great price!!! Love all three albums and saved so much on the price and the ability to receive all three in one package!!! Would recommend to everyone!!!
B00CF34B2I|3.0|the reason the app doesn't work on the kindle fire is cos the app is 1.5 gigs and the fires app storage compacity is 1.17 gigs .... apply should read the specs first before downloading and giving bad reviews... all it does is show how much ppl pay attention and blame others for their ignorance
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is fun so far. I've played the first level and it was entertaining. I would recommend this game to my friends.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Breaking Bad is very interesting.<br /><br />The acting is superb.<br />Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:<br /><br />l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.<br /><br />2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.<br /><br />3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.<br /><br />4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over.<br /><br />5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.<br /><br />6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.<br /><br />7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.<br /><br />8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.<br /><br />9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.<br /><br />10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.<br /><br />11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.<br /><br />12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.<br /><br />13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.<br /><br />14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.<br /><br />15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town. The local car dealers rely on them to spend their cash and everyone turns a blind eye.<br /><br />16. Someone with the DEA would be on Walt and Jesse's side. The money is just too much of a temptation. They could have paid off their own informant.<br /><br />17. Jesse and Walt's DNA would be in the UHaul Truck that did the magnet thing. The magnets would get traced back to the junk yard and case closed.<br /><br />18. All junk yards have to give account for cars that are smashed. Even though they got rid of the RV, there wouldbe enough left for DNA, even fingerprints. Case closed at that point.<br /><br />19. Someone would notice that Walt was visiting Jesse in the hospital. Case closed.<br /><br />20. The mask found in the desert would have had fingerprints or DNA from Walt. Case closed. It did lead them back to the school. DEA would have put in cameras and found Walt stealing more property. Most schools have cameras inside anyway. Case closed.<br /><br />21. Once Walt gets all that money, women would be after him.<br /><br />22. There are not enough female characters in this show. Women are always around where money is being made. Walt would have been tempted with plenty of 15 to 20 year olds. Hot chicks can sniff out cash.<br /><br />23. Walt would have been using cough drops with all that coughing.<br /><br />24. There is a mouth wash that cancer doctors prescribe for lung patients because of the dry mouth and odors. Walt would constantly be using mouthwash and cough drops.<br /><br />25. NO one with lung disease can run up and down steps. He would be on oxygen therapy with the air tanks needed at all times. Uncle Tio has them and he is sitting. Walt would not be that active with real lung cancer. Lungs determine all movement of the body. He would not be able to move like he does. Even driving a car is difficult with lung cancer and chemo.<br /><br />26. Nothing is said about the raids on Gus's delivery trucks. Law enforcement would have been involved, this would lead to Gus; case over.<br /><br />27. Ted would not be all goo goo over a 40 year old pregnant woman. He would have a long line of 20 year olds in his bed.<br /><br />28. Once Skylar found problems with Ted's books, he would have fired her. Men do not like bad news.<br /><br />29. They can pay $800,000 for a car wash????? How is that money laundering????<br /><br />30. Walt would have been traveling to the Caymen islands or other sites that will launder money for him. He could afford to hire a private plane.<br /><br />31.Walt would have an alternate plan of escape. With 80 million he would have many options.<br /><br />32. He would have been sending the family on long vacations, as in Europe or Australia. People with new money travel. He would keep them out of town and out of his way and out of harm.<br /><br />33. Most people who live in the West do speak Spanish. A person with Walt's intelligence would pick it up easily.<br /><br />34. Walt would buy diamonds and expensive shoes for Skylar. Woman can be bought off. Logically, he would appeal to her ego. As Ron White says, &#34;Diamonds, that will shut her up.&#34;<br /><br />35. The baby does not seem to grow very fast. Most children will not fit into a bassinet at age 6 to 9 months. Is that a real baby? Looks fake. Why is it always wearing a hat? In New Mexicto with heat in the 100's to 110's?<br /><br />36. Skylar would have followed Walt to the laundry. case closed.<br /><br />37. Friends of Crazy 8 would have gone to see Jesse as he was last seen with him.<br /><br />38. The police are portrayed as bunbling fools. Not so. They are generally very thorough. Not believeable that no police officer can put two and two together.<br /><br />39. There would have been a police report filed when Walt crashed the new car he bought for Walt Jr. Noone gets away with that kind of damage without someone noticing. cash closed<br /><br />40. Hank has plenty of chances to bug Walt's home or car. He would have just to find out the truth, then, he could have built his case.<br /><br />41. Gus's operation was way to big for him to rely on one person to cook. He would have had cooks all over the place. He could have set up labs in his trucks. He was too smart to put all his eggs in one basket.<br /><br />42. Tio would not pee in a pool in front of the Don--never happen. pee on flowers or people, but not the pool where gals are gonna be swimming.<br /><br />43. Walt Jr. never changes. A kid at age 16 changes in many ways. His hair style is not modern. His clothes are like circa 1995.<br /><br />44. Jesse's shirts never get dirty. The white stays the whitest. He sleeps in clothes, but they do not wrinkle and he does not smell. Not believeable.<br /><br />45. Hospitals film all visitors. Hank would have reviewed the tapes to see who was visiting Jesse. case closed<br /><br />46. All in all, too many things just are not believeable. Police are not that bad at their jobs and criminals are not that lucky.
B000YMFCS4|5.0|Love love love this movie!!! Makes my heart melt every time I watch it. A true love that we all can hope and pray for.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Yes, I am a fan of Breaking Bad, however, there are major flaws in the story that just have to be addressed. Here are a few:<br /><br />l. Walt Jr. is far too cooperative for a 16 year old boy. When asked to do chores, he always says, &#34;Sure, Mom!&#34; like he is soooo happy. Most 16 year olds are sassy, self-centered, sleep all day-up all night, talk back, spend 99% of time with friends, NEVER do housework, and more. His grades would tank, too, if his dad was as much trouble as Walt Senior.<br /><br />2. Jesse's teeth are too perfect. A heavy meth user's teeth ground away with the constant use and gums are red, bloody, soft. Other users on the show have bad teeth, but not Jesse. NOT believeable.<br /><br />3. There is hardly any mention of DNA. At all murder scenes in which Walt just walks away, his DNA would be everywhere. BOTH their DNA and fingerprints were all over Uncle Tio's house--case over.<br /><br />4. At Tio's when Tuko throws Jesse and Walt's phones into the back yard, police would have found them, found their fingerprints and case over.<br /><br />5. Jesse is not that attractive that super hot chicks would be after him. The actresses chosen to play his love interests are way too pretty for a guy who is a big loser. They are also too tall and too big for him. He seems overpowered by them.<br /><br />6. The theft of lab equipment would have been noticed. Other teachers would have complained that things were missing. Schools keep up with stuff better than that. Each teacher uses the equipment, so someone would have noticed. There is always a bitchy woman on the staff who keeps up with stuff right down to pencils and erasers.<br /><br />7. No one ever seems to be looking out a window to see murders and kidnappings. Just not realistic.<br /><br />8. Mike would have immediately killed Walt when Walt killed Gus. Mike would know he had to get to Walt before Walt got to him.<br /><br />9. Killing 9 in prisons? Come on!! Prisons have cameras everywhere. Someone would have seen something. NOT believeable.<br /><br />10. When Hank was driving by the laundry, he would have seen Walt's car. We cannot believe that a skilled detective would rely on one person to drive him by that place only one time. He would have driven by at all hours of the day and night.<br /><br />11. Walt would have spent his money all along for basic household needs. They were barely getting by, so he would have been buying groceries, new shoes for Walt, Jr., baby clothes, gas, etc. He would have always had a pocket full of cash, to make Skyler's life smoother. She would have liked that and he could have eased her along better.<br /><br />12. Why did Walt make a pass at the principal? Does not make sense for him logically. We are to believe he does all things out of logic. This would only harm him.<br /><br />13. We are told over and over how he does this for his family. All right-----we get it. You do not have to remind us....enough already.<br /><br />14. Jesse throwing money away would not happen. He would be doing his best to show that he is a winner to his parents. He would have been buying things for his parents, sending his mom flowers on all occasions, and spending the cash on the girlfriends for diamonds, clothes, etc.<br /><br />15. Jesse would not drive a beat up car. He would have a Lexus or Mercedes. All drug dealers drive the best cars in town.

All major roads have &#34;eye in the sky&#34; cameras. When people die, relatives know who the last person is that was with them.<br /><br />47. All in all, too many things just are not believeable.

B006YMLE7G|5.0|I rented this movie on a whim off of Netflix.  Watched it and loved it so much I bought the Bluray the same night.<br /><br />Go watch the trailer right now.  Everything you see is entirely hand-drawn!  There are some wacky elements to it, but the soundtrack, characters, and action are phenomenal.<br /><br />Very solid and highly enjoyable overall.  The last moments of the movie had me at the edge of my seat and the movie left me breathless.<br /><br />If you like any combination of action, anime, or racing movies, you owe it to yourself to watch this.

My brothers both use automatic weapons and I know plenty of law enforcement officials who tell me that when the bullets fly from an automatic rifle, someone dies. Oh, Hank falls to the ground as his defense against automatic weapon fire. Hank would be dead. He would have been hit with many bullets and his head would explode like a watermelon bursting open.<br /><br />46. Too many dead bodies and no one seems to be missing them.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|A great game. The pics are so realistic, and definitely kid-friendly. And no ads. Only one thing that's not great: it takes a while for it to load upon opening and to download. Still, awesome!
B00976NY6A|5.0|There's a sort of majesty to alot of The Killers songs these days.  Bigger and more epic than most of the songs out there.  They have a kind of (thess rock opera) Jim Steinman grandness to their music. This album is no different. For anyone thinking of getting into The Killers for the first time I personally would reccommend starting with &#34;Sam's Town&#34; but you can't go wrong with this album either.  Great music.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is right there on my Kindle to click on. So much easier than having to go through the whole Web route. Thank yu for creating an app for Yahoo!
B000TEPKS4|5.0|I've been a big fan of &#34;The Band&#34; for many years.  Even had the honor of seeing them live many years ago (minus guitarist Robbie Robertson).  There's an understated elegence to their music that kind of sneaks up on you over time.  You think you're listening to simple songs but as time goes by you realize the genius in their music.  I think that the great thing about buying a collection like this is you get to experience the full range of their music.  There is nothing wrong with a &#34;greatest hits&#34; album for a band (any band) but sometimes what happens is that some of their truly best music is omitted.  That is why I would reccommend this album. If you know about The Band then you do not need me opining on their greatness.  If you are thinking about listening for the first time I do reccomend this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|We were so excited when we found an app for the Minions!  It is easy to use. But does take a few moments to download onto my Kindle.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|I am often annoyed at how easy many games are but this one was more challenging than most. The puzzles were unique and fun; a great game to pass the time. :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved it so much<br />I was crying so much at the end.<br />Everyone should read it just saying.<br />Its the best
B00DYTKKGI|2.0|It's weird. not like you would think.  It repeats itself.  I like games that are more like flo's diner where you buy stuff go to different levels.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is one of the most unique and entertaining games I've played. A combined hidden object and puzzle solving it can get you hooked quickly! Highly enjoyable and recommended.
B003UESJDI|4.0|Clever adaptation of a graphic novel that keeps viewers engaged right to the surprising twist at the end.  I've watched this movie several times, and it's always great fun.  Lively characters and plot.  A delightful comedy!
B009A882D0|5.0|very good sound ilike a lot the sound it so good that alike a lot i welel recomend a lot
B005MLOOJA|4.0|Season 2 continues to maintain the intensity and pace of Season 1.  And character development continues throughout the season to build out the cadre of intriguing cast that make up this fine series.
630514415X|1.0|The 'He Got Game' DVD I purchased from Amazon was pretty much a bootleg movie. It had terrible picture quality!!
B0014BC3C2|5.0|I did not hear about this movie coming to the theaters and I am sure glad I saw it on Amazon. I would highly recommend this for anyone who likes stories about the issue of terrorism.

B009GED3HS|5.0|I am really gonna miss this show.  Only one season left.  It has been the best sitcom for 8 years
B00CM9JKQM|4.0|Queensryche's thirteenth studio long-player, 2013's eponymously-entitled effort, is the prog metal-originators' first with a new man behind the mic. Todd La Torre (of Crimson Glory fame) fills in for the recently fired Geoff Tate, a vocalist that had fronted the band for some twenty-eight-plus years. But La Torre fills in his shoes perfectly well. So well, in fact, that one just might have to look at the linear notes to make sure it is indeed La Torre and not Tate behind the mic. He fills these eleven cuts with memorable vocal harmonies, epically huge choruses, and infectious sing-along refrains.<br /><br />The terrifically dark and atmospheric introductory mood-enhancer that is \\"X2\\" sets the stage for and flows perfectly well into \\"Where Dreams Go To Die,\\" an up-tempo piece of almost pure power metal propelled forward by crunchy guitar licks, a strong, grumbling bass line, and dramatic, drum roll-style fills. And Todd's vocals? They ice the whole thing off with soaring, Ronnie James Dio-esque soaring clean vocals (although La Torre most likely meant them to be more of a homage to the dude's influences rather than just an overt rip off of Dio's style.) But then, following that \\"Spore,\\" a heavy and crunchy chugger, comes \\"In This Light,\\" a gorgeous ballad that boldly showcases Geoff's warm pipes and soulful-upper register crooning.<br /><br />The rest of the album works in similar fashion, with up-tempo rockers setting the stage for and giving way to more involved melodic ventures. \\"Redemption\\" is a tasty heavy number with deliciously crunchy, cascading, chugga-chugga riffs, and some emphatic, pyrotechnic guitar soloing; and \\"Vindication\\" is a surprisingly heavy speed metal anthem with a propulsive, grumbling bass line underpinning some really dexterous drumming and twiddly melodic guitar leads. \\"A World Without,\\" a soaring, symphonic-tinged ballad; \\"Don't Look Back,\\" a Judas Priest-inspired speed metaller with brisk, fiery, chugging riffs, deftly pounding double-time drumming, and screaming guitar solos; and \\"Fallout,\\" a heavy rocker with some of the album's best and most epic and deliciously air-guitar-able soloing, are a few of the album's other most memorable moments.

B005MMY9A8|5.0|I love these super hero movies, especially when they are well written and well cast. This is one of the best.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Kitchen House is a lovely, beautifully crafted novel. The characters are rich and intense. The book also reads quite quickly.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love love the shows. I watch them over and over. Blessed it great no commercials and the actors seem to really care about the show. But maybe that's why there actors.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|What a delightful discovery this book was. Howey creates a fully realized world, then populates it with three-dimensional characters, and puts them in interesting, often thrilling, situations. I'm very much looking forward to reading Shift and Dust.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Graphics are clear and crisp on Kindle Fire. Great, well-developed story. Tools were at just the right level for me, not too much, but just really useful/helpful.
B009LDD54K|5.0|Can't wait to see what happens next.  Watched Episode 1 of Season 1 and the characters have evolved so much.
B00740FMTS|5.0|I love the game so the book was a must.
0385349947|5.0|Fantastic read! This book gets your mind Rollin about all the opportunists you have to grab business by the horns and become a leader. I am applying for two promotions since reading this book. It showed me how men and women are different and women need to advocate for themselves.
B007HACDLK|2.0|I bought this book at the recommendation of my dad and read it while traveling for work.  Other reviewers seemed to love it.  But frankly, it's kind of boring.  It's so frequently mentioned how awesome and skilled and deadly Mitch Rapp is, for me, it detracted from the suspense. I never felt I was given a chance to think that Mitch couldn't win, he's never humanized enough. Furthermore, the book is full of spelling errors. Though this doesn't ruin the plot or anything it's just a bit annoying when reading.<br /><br />Overall, the author's nearly constant praising of Mitch Rapp detracts from the believability and suspense of the plot.  Thus the fun of an espionage/spy suspense thriller is heavily diminished.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I am not really into zombie movies, but my kids love them. We purchased this movie and watched it yesterday. It really was a lot better than I expected. I would recommend this movie even if you aren't a huge zombie fan.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|This is a fun adventure I didn't like the last movie but the rest of them make it worth it I'm really happy with the set
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My 9 year old niece introduced me to this game and it is lots of fun. Never forget your inner child!
B002M9WW30|5.0|Fix a rocky series as well as some of the best drama out there it always keeps you on the edge you see GG that spirit of wanting to push yourself further this is a great series
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I love these physics based games. Sugar, sugar is one that takes some thinking to get the paths for the sugar exactly right. Some have to be turned upside down to go into a cup, then turned back to go into another. Challenging but really fun!
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really didn't like the idea of bringing back con when it was done so well the first time but this was a good movie I enjoyed it so I hope you enjoy to
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I really liked this book - an easy and entertaining read. I liked the story line and the way the author ties it all together in the end.
B00001OH80|5.0|Those like David Bowie this is some of his classwork I really enjoy this album and I think you will too if you like
B001TW68P4|5.0|Saw these guys the past two years at their Happy Together tour. They are great performers, line up fun &#34;oldies&#34; performers, and are delightful to watch and listen to... enjoyed them back in the 60-70 but  smile and laugh when I think of them... fun duo.
B0015XWUCC|5.0|This is one of Bowie extremely where awesome album I really like all of his work but this one seems to me be a little different from the rest I think if you guys gave it a chance you would like it as much as me
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|This game would have gotten 5 stars but it needs a different ending I would like . To know if there I'd going to be a sequel beyond that realy fun worth the buck it cost graphics are color and details a are amazing and really challenging
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|I grew up watching movies of mad Max I really enjoyed and then I'm glad they're on Blu-ray I think they're worth it
B0052OSTOS|5.0|This is great!  Easy to follow.  Soothing.  I think half the time I am in a restful sleep even before the meditation is over.  Very glad I purchased this.  I use it often at night to fall asleep.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun occasional crashing but all in all a good time decent graphics ok interface. takes some time to level up
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really good game because it has 101 games its the best game I have ever played.people should try it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Hats off to author very well written a journey of a Hero that involves a heroic artistic guy with revolutionary vision for computing products.
B00D2I8E46|5.0|Another fantastic album from Mr. Costello, highly recommended stuff. Great lyrics (as usual) paired w/ some funky beats for a fresh spin on Costello's style. Love it!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I have numerous photo albums saved to Facebook. Most do not show up when using this app. If I go back to the mobile app, they appear there.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|Amazing what this guy leaves in the vaults for years. My only quibble would be that they could have included even more unreleased covers from this project, but maybe they weren't that great.... yeah, right. This box set to me was worth every penny. If you are any kind of a fan of Bob, you will enjoy this!
B0000VCZKW|5.0|this is about a little girl that gets witch powers.  after a while of her family treating her like crap she gets even.
B00632HWOG|3.0|It deletes stuff to easy. Not real easy to work with. Can only view so many e-mails at a time. I removed it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I absolutely love this book. The movie wasn't to bad either. The book was definitely better but I enjoyed both.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I enjoyed the show very much. The actors did a great job as did the writers. Can't wait to watch other seasons.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was funny, I could not imagine but I did enjoy the book. I am a very visual reader so my mind was rolling this film.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Interesting light reading<br />Kiernan-Lewis knows France - her narrative makes you feel as though you are actually experiencing the streets, shops, and food of France.
0425252868|5.0|Great story about war time and the valor and respect that enemies have for each other. A must read if you like history.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Not sure why this was panned by critics.  I felt that on a visual level alone, and perhaps on a musical level as well, this movie was mesmerizing and quite worth while.
B00CRS88IO|1.0|Horrible writing.  Is the author a 15 year old?  I bought this because I am interested in Ian Flemming, not because I'm interested in somebody's romantic fantasies of who Flemming was.  I got about 60 percent through the book when I decided to toss it.  A complete waste of time.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|In this film I found myself not caring about the characters, the plot or the conflict.  It felt like they were making it up as they went along.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Love the zombie mode its pretty awesome but there story thing is pretty hard including the harder ones but its a fun game so injoy if u like it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent book.  Put a great spin on all of the conspiracy theories surrounding the Kennedy assassination.  I would highly recommend this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so awesome! I read through it in a day. I can't wait to watch the movie. Definitely recommend!
B000002KCV|5.0|When you just have to listen to Neil Young.  Love the duets with Nicolette Larson.  One of my old time favorites.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I am very happy to have seen this movie.<br />Not too much gore, yet an intriguing story line.<br />Finally a zombie movie with a happy ending.<br />Kudos!
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I give this a 5 star rating! My son loves Legos and Minecraft so this made the perfect gift! I plan to buy the Nether Legos as well! Great doing business here~ Thanks!
B005CRQ4XI|3.0|This was recommended by a friend who knew that I'd recently lost my mother. It is very interesting and enlightening, but the author's style is too 'earthy' for me. That is, it's a good story, well told, but not a great story wonderfully told.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I am not a religious scholar or a biblical historian - just someone who likes to read thought-provoking books. I found this book enlightening as to explaining the myths that grew around the historical Jesus.  The author cites many historical and scholarly sources to make the point that Jesus was a man of his times and his geography, yet his early followers and the gospel writers rewrote that story to transform Jesus of Nazarus to Jesus the Christ. I found the writing action-filled and intellectually sophisticated.  Fundamentalist Christians will probably not like this book if they are looking for historical information to buttress their faith. The book provides an detailed descriptions of the rancor that existed between Rome and the Jews, as well as the enmity between the commom jewish peasants and the temple priesthood. The book also reveals information I didn't know about the relationship between Jesus and John the Baptist and between Jesus and his brother James the Just.<br /><br />I recommend a similar book: [[ASIN:0060675578 Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes]]  by John Shelby Spong.
B000GWE44U|5.0|I watched this movie with  my son and I had forgotten how good the movie is and what a great actor Jack Nicholson is in this movie.
6304722303|5.0|If you love alien you will really love aliens.  I haven't seen it in a while and I had to purchase it.  The product came on time and had no problems.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Creepy &compelling , the story line is such is that one must continue on to see what happens next.<br />He's a killer with a code and  YET.??
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd how he's meant to be! Finally a adaptation of Dredd that is true to the character. I hope there are sequels!
1579128149|5.0|I recommend strongly this wonderful book, that's why one of my students, asked for one and I bought it for him.
B00E63OMEM|5.0|I'm10 years old and I loved this book it's funny and cool and it tells every thing about adventue time you should buy this book it was worth every penny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Well done Gillian Flynn. Bravo.<br /><br />Another great psychological thriller by Ms. Flynn. This is my second book that I've read by her. The first was Gone Girl, which was a total mindfreak.<br /><br />This one, although a lot of the suspense and momentum building was good, was not as spectacular as Gone Girl.<br /><br />The abuse, violence, and hostility that went on made me squeamish. This is not for the faint of heart. And then the parts about the slaughterhouse....I wanted to vomit.<br /><br />You learned to hate the characters as much as you wanted them to personally suffer. All the pain that Camille went through...I can't believe it. The ending...with that surprised, shock and awe twist. WOW. I had to re-read that paragraph, because I did a headshake &#34;whoa, wait WHAT?!&#34;<br /><br />Reason for 4 stars only - I wanted to see the ending tied up a little better. So much effort was placed on the pain and abuse in this book, and I understand why, but then I felt the ending was just left hanging... With so much time spent on other trivialities, I felt that the ending for this one character should have had more closure for her. Oh well. I just wanted her to be happy.<br /><br />Bottom line: Good read. I could see myself liking it more if I hadn't read Gone Girl first. Not recommended for the squeamish or faint of heart. Gillian Flynn truly delivers another mindffreak.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Though these movies lack some of the essence of the original cast they are in them self great movies with strong story lines, good  actors and lots of action
B000FC1192|5.0|I watched the movie and loved it. Then decided to read the book. Neil has a wonderful way of writing. I definitely plan on reading more of his work.
B008B403VS|5.0|This is the greatest Soundwave G1 toy to really have  for ur collection and Everybody should get this Soundwave It's the real one like the 80's cartoon. I'm glad I got him for my collection when I was a kid I couldn't even fine him in the stores they where all sold out now today I'm in my 30's and finally I got him in my collection and Everyone should get him NOW and Quickly Amazon and the Seller gets 5 stars and a A+ in my book.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so addicting and way better than the previous ones. Definately worth the couple dollars i spent on it. Works pretty good on my kindle fire hd, it has only froze when i accidently clicked on internet stuff when my wireless was off.
0425266060|4.0|This book is a little bit like Fifty Shades of Grey the plot and characters but the romance it's different
B0064X7FVE|2.0|It is not as easy to use as the old app.  I wish I did not update it.  Plus the &quot;pretty&quot; photos are distracting and too busy so it's difficult to read the weather information.  It is not an improvement.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I am the king at my Twitter name Facebook page and my istagram my Skype my Kim and my MySpace page and I am 11 you can't touch this
0802473156|5.0|This book CAN change things dramatically! Just being aware of what your own love language is,, gets you in touch with why you get frustrated with your partner.<br />If you know how your partner receives love (what makes them feel MOST loved) than you have the tools to really make them feel loved. It is HUGE in showing how we think we are communicating and how we really may not be.<br />I think ANY love relationship would benefit from the awareness this book can open up. IF you want your partner to feel loved by you than READ IT! You may just be speaking different love languages, and you CAN do something about it.<br />I have bought 4 copies for others now because it is not a technique book, it is a 'definition' book. It's SO simple, and SO easy once you figure out how you give and want to receive love.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Absolutely love this game!! Amazing on the computer and even better on my tablet! The new powerups and gems are very nice features! And I love the new levels and enemies.
1587613379|4.0|As long as we realize that it is a journey that not everyone can or should take, than it may be useful. It was good to read that everyone has struggles and challenges in alternative relationships. But, there are no easy answers and those relationships are not without pain and adjustments.
0756686970|5.0|My grandson has memorized every character in this book.  I am glad that it made him so happy.  One of his favorite books.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I placed five stars because it was very romantic, mysterious, and lots of suspense. I would recommend this to people that like science fiction and romantic mixed together.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Thes movie is by far the greatest movie of all time, it tells you about Johnny's love for music, addiction, depression, his love, and his whole life, highly recommend this!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Hey , I love Percy Jackson's book , it's awesome , I love the way the author wrote the story and it is funny how Percy narrates it ..
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|I was trying to like this film, but the plot mechanics went from reasonable to ridiculous after about 20 minutes.  I guessed the \\"twist\\" half way through the film, so lazy is the writing.  Even top character actors could not save this attempt at a clockwork caper film.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Perfection is to some extent a very personal determination. On the other hand, perfection is earned. Bowie gets the category of the latter. Few lifelong-active recording artists maintain such fresh rose originality as Bowie, who comes back with an amazing surprise album after ten years. Did we expect anything more? Did we expect less? Bowie, in his own way, is a perfectionist. There is no other explanation for why his work still keeps coming out brilliant-sounding, year after year, decade after decade. Since he may have been more conscious of legacy in making \\"The Next Day\\" than in profitability, this album may stand as one of his greatest recording achievements, raw, ambiguous, the mark of a genius imitating errs--only to show the errs are clearly intentionally part the song. Without those subtle off-kilter changes in chord progression, for instance, we would have mundane three-bar sameness. Bowie rises above the belowness.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Because I found the Mistborn Trilogy so intriguing and enjoyable, I purchased The Way of Kings.  During the first few pages, I thought, \\"Oh, this is a going to be a guy book.\\"  I was so wrong!  This is a fully human book, embracing male AND female--the animus and animus in all of us.  It is not an easy read because one's questions about people, places, and situations are not immediately answered.  One must gradually learn about them, growing in understanding.  What makes understanding possible is that every character, every conflict, every struggle resonates so vibrantly with what I believe is experienced by all of us.  Have you ever been torn apart by apparent contradictions in trying to determine what is \\"right\\"?  Have you pondered who you really are; your purpose for existing?  Do you wonder about the evolution of mankind, the direction that is best for us, and your role in it?  Are you delighted with the ideas of quantum physics, bioengineering, the ways of the brain and potential powers of the mind?  Have you ever experienced angst considering the positive as well as negative characteristics of all human institutions (including religion), realizing that EVERY human characteristic, belief, decision, way of life is necessarily a construct of BOTH light and shadow?  Do you believe that many of our most cherished beliefs are really metaphors for a reality we cannot fully understand with our finite minds?  Do you consider power both necessary and corrupting?  If so, I believe you will love this novel!  With the artistic skill of a Japanese painter, Sanderson creates an entire, vivid world peopled with multifaceted characters using minimal brushstrokes of words; and, every character has his own, genuine voice.  This is an amazing accomplishment.  Further, we are enabled to enter into each character's mind and heart, sharing their mental and physical experiences with empathy.  Have you ever been really engaged in a story when, suddenly, you feel like a voyeur insteadof a compassionate observer; and, find yourself distancing yourself from the situation in order to protect your soul and keep from being dragged down into feelings that destroy instead of enlighten?  Sanderson never does this in The Way of Kings.  He writes with perfect aesthetic distance.  To me, this book masterpiece!
0385535147|4.0|He still is one of the great mystery writers to have...compelling, descriptive, captivating.I hate to put it down but love to come back to it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book has so many characters, it's hard to keep up with all the names. Yet, I was hooked all the time. I want to read all the series of books. I care for the characters and I want to know what will happen to them
B003G94BZC|5.0|While the whole Amy - Rory - Doctor thing stretched out a bit too long, it is still about the best thing on TV.  Thoughtful, long-term character development, silliness and absolute absurdity all rolled into one.
0385345054|5.0|This book is one of the best craft books I've ever seen.  Yes the flowers are beautiful, but the booked is organized excellently.  It starts off with pictures of the flowers, then goes into the materials in detail, follows up with the tools used, then skill and technique, includes a step by step for each flower referencing back to the page numbers of the skills, templates for each flower and ends with a list of sources.<br /><br />The source list in the back doesn't just list a bunch of stores and websites.  It actually tells you which items they purchased from each source.  This is a crafters dream come true!  It has something for a newbie as well as a more experienced crafter.  I think this book can be used in two ways:<br /> - Pick one of the flowers, buy the materials for that and make it<br /> - Check out the skill section and practice the various techniques until your perfect them to your liking<br /><br />If you want to learn the art of making crepe paper flowers, this is the book to teach you!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie is unique in is own way. Imagine your younger brother or sister name came up then their name was picked from a bowl to participate in the hunger games. Would you be strong enough to take there place in a game of true survival?  Out of 12 districts only one person will survive and win to life a life of luxury.  Well done. strong actors, I was pleasantly surprise how this movie ended.
B000FC11JW|5.0|I read The Effective Executive last year at the recommendation of a good friend. It is a great book on leadership, not just for executives, but for anyone regardless of your title. The book was originally published in 1967, so I was reading it 45 years after the fact. Yet, by and large, the content was as relevant for today’s business leaders as it was when it was first written.
B00BE97ONM|5.0|If you like your books gritty, suspenseful and utterly unpredictable, then this book has your name on it. The author takes you into the most intimately terrifying reaches of the mind of a serial killer and if you happen to be the sort who can easily become queasy, then you should stay far, far, away. On the other hand if you are enamored of stories that zig when you expect them to zag and keep you guessing to the very end, you are in precisely the right place. \\"The Phantom\\" is highly skilled in the \\"art\\" of murder and butchery and the riveting chase is on. The question is this: will he be caught and if so, how and when? Highly, highly recommended in every way and I am very intrigued as to where Jams talents will take us next time.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|This book tells the story of a young woman, Grace, who works  as a maid in the era of WW I and into the twenties in the House at Riverton.  She developes an intense loyalty to the two daughters of the house.  As events begin to unfold she becomes more and more entangled in the lives of the two girls and their longing to be free of their father's and society's constraints.  The narrative goes back and forth between the time of her employment at Riverton and her old age in the 1990's.  This book has many twists and turns and surprising outcomes that will keep the reader engaged to the last page.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It's like watching it on t.v. I'm glad Amazon offers these shows. I will be ordering more episodes! I love it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I am definitely picking this for my book club, could not put it down.  My sister had recommended it to me.
B005C0DHEY|4.0|This was an excellent, convincing view of fracking. The footage and interviews definitely got their point across well.  I hope it helps those being affected by fracking get their story more widely known and accepted.<br /><br />I was a bit disappointed at the extreme bias, however. I think more of an effort could have been made to make it more evident that there is another side of the story - why not interview the many who live next to natural gas wells who /don't/ have negative feelings about the wells?<br /><br />Also, while I understand these are amateurs who put together the film, the poor videography was painfully difficult to watch at times. Don't watch this while you have a headache.
B0053ZOQMK|5.0|smart, imaginative, wonderfully and wildly exaggerated animation using bright colors and magnificent use of space, all with dynamic vocal performances by Johnny Depp and others...<br /><br />a GREAT story with multiple layers of homage to other classic film scenes and a satirical wit that keeps you both giggling and on your toes.
B00BESM14U|3.0|Very well-acted and relatable for all of us socially inept when we were young folks. Emma shines as well as her brother! Shows the deep wounds abuse can cause and teaches valuable lessons...
B003VANOFY|5.0|My family loves these.  The kids use them for video games, we use them for music or to talk on Skype with family or friends.  You can walk to the kitchen and cook dinner while they are on, with the push to talk feature above the left ear.  When you push up the microphone it automutes (which comes in really handy when the kids are screaming and you are on a business call).  They were super easy to connect, and the on screen software to set them up was easy enough for the computer illiterate (like myself) to use to set them up.  I like these alot!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|The best business book I have ever read. Almost mystical in the way it weaves life and performance theory into one along with some tech pathways to getting where you want to go. After you say it the best there is no other place to go. And he is funny.
0143124544|5.0|An unusual love story of two people who have practically nothing in common and how each of them deals with almost insurmountable odds.  Very touching and romantic while, at the same time, it breaks your heart!
B0019IB0II|1.0|This book was not very good at all. I only got through the first couple of chapters before I couldn't read any farther.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|A zombie movie that finally sinks it's teeth into you. Great storyline concerning the origins of this disease. I thought it to be a non stop thriller through and through. Brad Pitt does an great job in his quest for the truth. Would love to have this one for my video collection.
1594204217|5.0|Absolutely right on the money!  It says it all.  A Must Read  worth your time and it just might get you back in the kitchen
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The story is good and the writing is easy to read. One can tell, the writer speaks from experience.  There were a few parts that didn't make sense to me and didn't seem to flow well- almost like those parts were written by a man rather than a woman.  My husband enjoyed me reading the book too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I was so shock by the story.  I keep thinking what would I have done in the same situation , WOW.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has really outdone herself with this series! I can't get enough of Gideon and Eva!! Please hurry with book four! I didn't want the third book to end. I suggested this series to many friends who have fallen in love with these characters as much as I have. I was a Fifty Shades fan but have to say this is so much BETTER!
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|I was enjoying the game but when I got to level 18 it started crashing on start up. Very frustrating, andI'm glad I didn't spend much money on this just allot of wasted time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the landdcapes and animals. Creative mode is awesome!! :) don't worry if you can't a few items. there are usually updates.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I can't seem to stop playing this one! Love hidden object games and love puzzle solving. Entertains me for as long as I have energy the play the levels! Really enjoy the sort of steampunk feel and look if the interface. Look forward to more seek and find games like this one.
0307272702|5.0|This is an update from Taube, very readable with critical knowledge for every individual. also a great book to give to someone you love to help with there understanding of today's food offerings.
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved this show as a child and began re-watching on a lark. I was surprised to find how well it has aged. Sure, some of the computing technology is a bit hilariously outdated, but MacGyver's knowledge in the building blocks of the universe -- physics, geology, astrology and chemistry -- have not. The ways in which he employs that knowledge to get out of delightfully campy jams is still clever and thoroughly entertaining.
B001F12J0C|5.0|This has been my favorite spy trilogy since way back when it was just novels by Robert Ludlum. They brought them up to date without betraying the intrigue and story lines. I do think that a large portion of the audience may not have made the leap between #2 and #3, but being able to watch them all together (like chapters in a book) that clarifies any confusion. Two thumbs up!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I felt blessed to read this book.  The insight into disease and death by these young people was very enlightening and uplifting for me.  My hesitation in recommending it comes because of the life philosophies of the individuals, very worldly.  I am grateful for my faith in God and what He has promised for the next life.

B00A0ABQLM|4.0|Purchased the Anker Uspeed adapter to go with the Anker Uspeed 3.0 USB PCIe card previously reviewed, to replace the onboard 10/100 ethernet on the motherboard.  Using the motherboard, my transfers were in the 10 mb/s range.  Plugging in this device upped the speed to about 43 mb/s.  Using some suggestions found online for WIndows 7, I disabled IPv6, turned off the packet compression, and enabled Jumbo packets (my server allowed several choices up to 9kb, while the Anker driver maxed out at 4kb) so I set both at 4kb.  WIth those settings, I got 56 mb/s, which is also the speed I get transferring files from my 7200 rpm drive to my SSD, so that limitation was on the hard drive subsystem, not the Uspeed adapter.  Very pleased.  Only reason for the negative one star, is it causes a little interference with the USB mouse plugged into a separate USB bus if the Uspeed adapter is close to the mouses USB dongle.  Moving them apart inproved things, but will need to investigate this further.<br />Would recommend this to anyone wishing to upgrade their 10/100 system.  Driver on the disc installed with no problem, and Windows Update immediately installed a newer version.  Took right over from the 10/100 adapter without even having to disable it in bios.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great books--read all three in less than two weeks! Great storyline--keeps you on edge; great setting--interesting to ponder about the future; great characters.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|i like this game, but it does take a while to open the app on my kindle fire. other than that, this app is very fun and addictive.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Usually I don't write reviews. This one is worth. Enjoy it. My wife liked too. I am sure u will like as well<br />Best regards
B008XG1X18|5.0|Im addicted to pinterest and having it on my kindle fire makes it that much more awesome! The app does time out fairly easily, thoigj
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Lovely music to hear while you're getting ready in the morning, cleaning the house or riding in the car. :)
B001P5HI4A|5.0|This is an extraordinary film. Barbra is unparalleled in her talents, skills, and accomplishments. It's easy to understand why the industry, dominated by males, shunned her at the Oscars.  She continues to get her message out there that so many, for some frightening reason, find offensive.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film - musically, thematically, artistically.
B000S1M9LY|1.0|dry and belabored, I gave it the prelude and first chapter but found as was waned in the prelude that this book was just not my style.
0763644765|5.0|I read this book to both of my sons prior to potty training. It was a good simple book to teach them how to go potty. Their favorite part of the book was &#34;Tinkle tinkle toot!&#34; It's a super cute book! I love all the Leslie Patricelli books. Great buy!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is an excellent TV series.  I'm will into season 2 and still no let down in twists and turns.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|There's a lot of buzz about this novel including the fact that it is a going to be or is already a series on Netflix. I guess at some point everyone is curious as to what would have happened if they had been caught doing something illegal, and here's this privileged, pretty blond girl who did get caught being a drug mule.<br />It was horrifying but also it felt as if even in prison her life was a bit happier than the others because she had so much contact with friends, newspapers, books and magazines. She describes the other inmates in a very real and honest way. It is funny at times and sometimes very sad.<br />The ending seemed very rushed, as if she was tired of writing and just  ended the book. Although I enjoyed the book I  still found it hard to relate to her. I think it's a very worthwhile book to read and very educational, but I'm stopping a four stars, just my personal taste.
0744014956|5.0|Incredibly detailed and informative. For a game of this size and scope, a guide like this is a must have. Not to mention that Gamestop offers this very same book for $36.99. Buy the guide, select one day shipping and you'll still manage to save ten bucks. It's a no brainer.
B00821OX98|3.0|Its not the DOME.<br />Too predictable<br />Scrip needs better timing.<br />Monsters are too plastic.<br />Where is the suspense?<br />I will not order Season 2.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Cool game if u like this sort of thing.  Its hard to play when u dont spend any money on it... fustrating sometimes, but i do notice than when i play a level over and over, the game seems to almost make the board a bit easier as if it has taken pity on you.  I appreciate that very much.  Just one thing- couldnt seem to figure out who to contact to say that my two year old accidentally purchased a bubble with my amazon coins so i gave it up as a bad job. Otherwise very happy with tbe game.  Oh, they could make it a bit easier to earn coins too.
0345545338|5.0|A great read - when I read the first three chapters that were provided at the end of his novel, Calico Joe, I had to get this one and read it through.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|As allways thrilling, most Iike the John Geisham Style. Now the location is Chicago, and I only missed more description of the place. If you're a John Grisham fan, must read it
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Glad I got it....for free!!!!!!!!!  You can also..  I think you will enjoy it. So what are you waiting for?
B002KVCA1O|5.0|If you're in search of the big hits of the Rolling Stones from between the very early 70's to the early 90's, then you'll LOVE this, because they're ALL there! If you're a Rolling Stones fan, and would love to have all those early hits in one shot--this is definitely for you! All the songs are re-mastered, and are very high quality sound, which alone makes it worth replacing all those &#34;originals&#34; you already have. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase, and listen to it quite frequently. Absolutely no complaints!
0525478817|5.0|Okay so before I read this book I heard a lot about it and how great it was and at first I didn't know to believe the sources or not but I tried this book and I  literally finished it in pretty much a day. This book is absolutely amazing it basically stole my heart. It's funny sad happy all the good qualities u could want in a book. I think everyone she read this book it really is such a good book. Highly recommend this book to anyone.

B0045HCJ9E|5.0|VistaVision was Paramount's widescreen process. The film frame was about 4 times the area of regular 35mm. That's why you can hardly see any grain. Paramount first used VistaVision on their 1954 release of WHITE CHRISTMAS and all of their bigger pictures through the early 60's. Paramount's opening credit on these films proclaimed \\"VistaVision, Motion Picture High Fidelity\\". And it was SHARP, SHARP, SHARP! Hitchcock had been doing his films for Paramount in the mid 50's and used VistaVision for all of them including TO CATCH A THIEF, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY and VERTIGO among others. He evidently liked it so much that he probably insisted that MGM used it on NORTHWEST. Of course the transfer has to be good also to wind up with the superior quality seen on this disc. Want to show off your system...use this disc. The Blu Ray is out now and I can't begin to wonder how great the quality of that must be! NORTHWEST, REAR WINDOW and VERTIGO are my favorite Hitchcock films of the 50's. I was lucky to have seen them all in theatres when they were first released.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I purchased the LifeProof Case for my iPhone 4S after my husband come home with one on his new iPhone.  I wasn't wild about the pink color at first, but it was $40 cheaper, so I went for it.  The case works great and the pink really has grown on me :-)  It took a while to figure out how to switch the mute on and off, but that is really the only problem I experienced to date.  I now feel more confident that my phone is protected when I go to the gym or are out an about.  I'm even contemplating taking it swimming (not quite there yet).  I wish I had purchased this case sooner.
B00F6E4J2A|5.0|As someone before me said, listen to the hype.<br /><br />As an avid Elton John listener, under 40 (I'm 25), I've been disappointed with every album Elton John has released SINCE I'VE BEEN ALIVE. This despite him being one of my major musical influences. This Album, I would argue, is the best thing he's released since Captain Fantastic, maybe before. It is the best he's released in decades, and easily stands up to his earlier works.<br /><br />Listening to songs, you hear elements from Yellow Brick Road, Tumbleweed Connection, Madman Across the Water, and even some of his better recent work (a couple of the songs closely echo his single \\"I Guess That's Why They Call It The Blues.\\" He also delves into some new territory, but this is a landmark work by an artist at the top of his game, and going back to the roots that made him great. It's like he took the best of everything he did over the years and compiled it into 15 songs. He and Taupin are at the top of his game, and anyone who likes listening to him for more than just the hits, will love this album.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Being a huge Neil Gaiman fan, I rarely find anything he's written or been involved in which I don't love, and this book is no exception. It's a short, quick read which I finished in one evening and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of. The imagery of the book is wonderful, as is the magical story in general. Don't want to say too much - just read it!
B0000CNY27|5.0|One of Kurt Russell's favorite movies, mine to,  really gritty and dark, for today's standards they could do more, but back in the day it was ground breaking.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I really like like book it is  super funny book and I can not start reading a new diary of a wimpy kid.

B009NQZVKG|4.0|Just another great Rollins read.! I am glad to add this to my Rollins collection and to my library. Thanks.!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Overall it was an interesting read, but you get bogged down in spots.  Some of the 'interviews' are kind of long winded which doesn't help at all.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|simple fun power ups perfect graphics enjoyable gameplay for a good game it'll take half your battery and that's after 10 levels. happy fun.
1401232590|4.0|Great story. Really draws you in. It proves to be a nice detective story. My only problem was Tim Sale art work; I'm not a fan. :/
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Phenominal show so well written with such compelling characters, that it's hard to miss or wait for the next episode.  Even the villians are delicious.  Great show.
0380807343|4.0|\\"Through The Looking Glass\\" gets a modern, 'Gaimanesque' twist.<br />Phenomenally well done and spooky as hell.<br />I read this so I could discuss it with my nine-year old who has just started it and, as usual, found myself enthralled by Mr. Gaiman's writing.<br />He has such an amazing talent for getting the reader to not only empathize with his protagonist, but to truly see through his/her eyes.<br />Don't blink.<br /><br />Coraline, so very bored finds that life is not always greener on the other side.<br />Enter into a world fraught with peril and richly described.<br />I hear echoes of Danny Elfman singing in the background (though I don't think he had anything to do with the film version...I will have to see that now come to think of it).<br />Black and white stripy socks fill my head.<br />This one gives Alice a run for her money.<br /><br />A truly dark fairy tale with flavors of old storytelling infused with Gaiman's inimitable style.<br />I see why this is enjoyed by schools, children, adults and critics.<br />A classic and not to be missed.<br /><br />Say hello to \\"other-Mother\\" as you turn out the light and don't forget to feed the rats.<br /><br />Goodnight!<br /><br />Namaste~
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This ap is one of the best I've come across. A fun one that makes you think and problem solve. I got it for free but would definitely have paid for something this good. Sweet Success!
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Well written movie with interesting twists. Definitely enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this movie to a friend or family member.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The setup was ingeniously designed, but I kept running into hiccups all along the way. I have 50mps and have great wireless speeds everywhere in my home, but this thing doesn't seem to be working right. Only one mobile phone works well with it in our family. The laptops work OK, but it produces a lot of lag and buffering videos rendering it useless in most cases.<br />The only bonus is that it wasn't expensive so I feel I only wasted $35.
B008602KQI|5.0|This film moved me at the deepest levels.  In this day of statism and government/control it was refreshing and heartening to see the individual triumph in the fight for freedom versus oppression.  Idealist, perhaps, but inspiring.  A good handbook for the day we are pawns in the \\"Hunger Games.\\"  The music was intense and beautiful, especially the lullaby.  Thanks to the author of this story and the many persons who brought it to life on the screen!
B00A0SLTCU|1.0|First off, any review of Total Recall (2012) must compare it to Total Recall (1990), and in just about every way possible, the newer one comes up short.  Say what you want about Schwarzenegger's acting, he owned and sold the role in a way that Colin Farrell's sleepy, ballet-choreographed-fighting could not.<br /><br />Then there was the appalling decision to combine the Sharon Stone and Michael Ironside characters into a single Kate Beckinsale role, which failed on every possible level.<br /><br />Set design was accomplished by blatantly ripping off \\"Blade Runner,\\" with additional contributions from \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Minority Report.\\"  The Rekall store went from looking like a futuristic dentist's office to a hidden P.F. Chang's restaurant, for reasons that are utterly baffling -- isn't this supposed to be a major corporation, that advertises world-wide, like McDonald's?  Why would it be hard to find?<br /><br />The CGI wizardry of the modern day somehow looks tired and absurd compared to the effects Verhoeven achieved with technology 20 years older.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure there was a paragraph of dialogue that was lifted nearly verbatim from \\"The Matrix\\" when Morpheus is explaining to Neo that the brain simply detects electro-chemical inputs.<br /><br />Pacing was an absolute nightmare.  It went from slow, when Quaid is trying to figure things out, to slower, when they would commence one of the combat-ballets.<br /><br />Nothing was set up, and nothing was paid off.  There are battle droids, and sometimes they're bulletproof, and sometimes, you can shoot them.  There's a subway that goes through the Earth's molten rock and solid iron core.  (BTW, the ENTIRE trip on \\"The Fall\\" would be at Zero-G to the occupants, not just the middle five seconds.)  The rest of the world is uninhabitable because of \\"chemical weapons,\\" but you can survive in it just by wearing a gas mask.  Cohaagen, the chief bad guy (and \\"Chancellor\\"), is out there wearing a bulletproof vest with his suit trousers, on the front line with his troops.  It would be like if President Obama had personally accompanied Seal Team Six to track and kill Osama Bin Laden.  Jessica Biel's character was a cipher - we knew nothing about her, and she had nothing to do but provide occasional support for Colin Farrell.  We didn't care about any of the characters.  What's that?  You're going to launch a genocidal invasion?  Okay.  Go ahead.  I have nothing invested in anybody here.  Most of the characters with speaking parts don't even live in that part of the world, anyway.<br /><br />Want to watch \\"Total Recall?\\" Get the 1990 version and have a blast.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|exactly as needed. has given me no problems and opens quickly no frills and straight forward what id needed sometimes
B0060MYM3S|5.0|GREAT SERIES FOR HBO AND OWNING THE SET IAM ALWAYS LENDING TO OTHERS TO WATCH AND LOVE IT AS WELL
B004JN1D2I|4.0|When you purchase this item on a kindle all 4 books are rolled up into a single file. This makes it difficult to gauge progress on a book as you look down after the first one and see you're only between 16-19% through the file. The books themselves are great.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play while watching tv or before I go to bed. I never get tired of it! I recommend this game to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I couldn't play it on my kindle fire and this is my third time trying. I do not recommend it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have just started playing a few days ago and have found the game to be really relaxing and enjoyable.  Some artifacts I have problems matching at times and I am not sure exactly what is happening but I am learning.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|It has been a really long time since I enjoyed a book that much .The multiple layers stories within the main one , all the characters are equally well crafted and interesting . I had to finish &#34; I Am Pilgrim&#34;  , couldn't put it down and already recommend this book to few people .
B0016JBCJW|2.0|This movie was just unappealing. I didn't like the plot, and I feel like the message behind it was poorly represented.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I've read the book and now watched the movie. Both are AWESOME! Sometimes details are lost in the transition from book to screen but in this case it was not. Katie is on the run and looking for a safe place. Alex is just trying to do the best for his family. Neither one is looking for anything more but somehow stumble upon each other. This is not a typical love story. You have suspense and intrigue along with a twist in the end that leaves you feeling that everyone does deserve a second chance. I have highly recommended this movie as well as the book to my friends--even the ones who thought it was going to be just another love story and found out it wasn't. Pull up a chair, pop in the movie and, when it's over, be prepared to look at things with a different perspective. People are brought into our lives for a reason.
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|This pointless remake has almost none of the campy charm of the original series.  Worse, it takes many of the same jokes & gags from evil dead 2, except they all fall flat here.  It's terrible.  Avoid.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|I have 4 dogs and understand the energy they bring to owners, and appreciate the author's insight. Used my speed reading skills on some chapters that were ho hum.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great for kids and adults. There are so many characters, locations, and power-up upgrades that makes that game so addicting.
B000RO9PXC|3.0|Massive Doors fan here, so I am of course going to give it the benefit of the doubt; however I can only give this 3 stars max and here's why:  about 85% of this set is basically a drunk and mumbling incoherent Jimbo, along with a solid-sounding Doors background. However that being said, die-hard fans like me will enjoy about 15% of the material (mostly from the 2nd show) where Jim is clear and creative/ funny / engaging and in fact (spoiler alert) the last song they sing on disc 3 was a very cool hybrid of Jim singing the lyrics to 'Down so Long' (from LA Woman) over the top of the Doors playing the baseline music for what eventually became 'Maggie McGill' . So that was pretty cool and and it makes you wonder, was Jim trying to be creative or did his mind just meld those two songs together accidentally that night in Boston?
B007XNAQLA|5.0|This is a top notch CD, and video package. This particular incarnation<br />of RTF features: Stan Clarke, (bass) Chick Corea, (keyboards) Lenny White (Drums) with the addition<br />of Jean Luc Ponty on violin and Frank Gambale (Guitar). These are welcome additions<br />as they breathed life into the old material and really made it awesome. The video<br />documentary was very insightful and featured great insight on how the group started.<br />Standout performances by all but especially Stanley Clarke. These first rate performances show<br />that when the masters get older they sometimes get better.

1449410243|5.0|I paid $11.48 for this book with Prime, way way less than what it was going for in retail stores. The book was a gift for my mom, a crazy cat lady. She loved it. I would describe the book as a giant cat comic book, with tons of pictures of cat cartoons doing silly things. It made her laugh as well as myself. I recommend this as a great gift idea for any cat lover out there or for self amusement if you love cats.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I always like the information that Kathy Reichs places in her books.  I learn a lot.  However I feel this book was a trifle &#34;forced&#34; in order to make the connection between the initial murders and the solution far to the north.  The conclusion was abrupt but worth the wait.
B00CITOS4A|4.0|Scott provides many interesting tips for amateur photographers even if wedding photography won't be on the to do list. I plan on re-reading the book as I progress with this hobby. I can see there is much to learn and practice as I start taking more pictures.

I tried several things checking and verifying my installation everything is installed as indicated by documents. First Asus mobo I every owned that fail right off the bat. I guess I will return it, this was m y first crossfire setup too.
B00DWHWOFC|4.0|This game is fun. The colorful ones are my favourite. I would like more instructions on the ones with numbers. Also it would be great if the numbers disappeared or were crossed out when correct. However even like it is would not stop me from playing it. Thank you for creating it.

0718178130|2.0|Meh. That's how I feel about The Rosie Project. This book received 4.11 stars on Goodreads. I usually really trust the star rating on Goodreads ... I use it constantly to give myself an idea of what to expect from a book and this time, I felt betrayed. I expected a four star book and I was saddled with a 1.5 star book. I decided to go ahead and give the book the extra half a star because at least the author was grammatically correct throughout the entire thing.<br /><br />When I first heard about The Rosie Project, I was really excited. I thought that the premise was adorable and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. To my surprise, I won an ARC of the book through a Goodreads giveaway and I would get to read it before everyone else (insert nana-nana-na-na).<br /><br />My excitement was quickly extinguished once I cracked open that book and read the first page. BORRRRING! Hell, I know that sounds so rude but it's what is going through my head. I would hate to sugarcoat things and spew sunshine and rainbows when that's not how I feel.<br /><br />The main character is Don Tillman ... this Don character was a freaking nut job. He micromanaged his life down to the second. He is so stuck in the routine of his life that he doesn't actually live. He just exists. That's fine ... be anal retentive. Be weird. I have no problem with that. I have a problem with it a book being written like the back of a shampoo bottle. It was boring and I just couldn't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />Every single person that Don met, he would calculate their BMI. Every. Single. Time. It got old. Really quickly. Don also pointed out a persons faults in his head. Every time he spoke to someone. I found myself saying, \\"OH, MY GOSH\\" quite frequently because after a while of reading about these weird things Don does, it just became annoyingly annoying (that's the worst kind of annoying).<br /><br />It makes me wonder ... are books like children? Do they just want attention, no matter what kind it is? Good attention, bad attention ... kids don't care one iota, they just want attention. Is bad attention for a book good as well? By writing this scathing review, am I sending people to pick up this book? Will I be held responsible if someone drops into a coma because of my review?!? I sure hope not. Because there won't be enough hospital beds for the victims.t is? Good attention, bad attention ... kids don't care one iota, they just want attention. Is bad attention for a book good as well? By writing this scathing review, am I sending people to pick up this book? Will I be held responsible if someone drops into a coma because of my review?!? I sure hope not.

B00DHRLK84|5.0|In a world when zombie movies are becoming stale, boring and overused, there comes a film that defies popular zombie and disaster movie tropes, giving the viewer a genuinely fun, entertaining and well-made Zombie movie, until it's ultimately eventually by an unnecessary sequel.<br /><br />World War Z is a rare instance of an action-oriented zombie movie that's reasonably clever and thoroughly entertaining. The 3D is decent, not necessary but it works. Rather than being your typical &#34;the world is going to hell, everyone is a selfish dick and ends up being a bigger threat then the zombies&#34; movie or TV series, it's actually refreshing to see people act like believable people. After the initial panic, some people are in denial, some people really are pricks, some people help themselves, some people help others. The action is well shot and acted, the acting is spot-on, there's a diverse cast of characters that don't just behave like ridiculous racial stereotypes. Some of the characters could have used a bit more characterization, but the plot moves at a brisk pace and characters aren't completely wasted. There is a bit of hand-holding in the narrative but they actually show important plot details first, then touch on them later in quick, simple exposition. Overall a very well-made movie that hits pretty much all the right spots for me as a zombie flick.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game.  Keeps me coming back for more.  Wish I had know about this much sooner. I'm a fan.
B00EZZ77ZM|5.0|Johnson was redeemed himself.  His previous effort was a huge disappointment.  If you are a truly  dedicated J.J. fan/follower, you will NOT be disappointed this time around. I like that entire album/CD. Track 10 Is a personal favorite.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I've found all of Hosseini's books to be both enthralling and enlightening; A Thousand Splendid Suns may, however, be my favorite of all of his books. It gave me a glimpse of what it means to be a woman in Afghanistan - I found it both heartbreaking and hopeful.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I love action or thought provoking scifi. This is neither. Almost the entire movie is spent waiting for something to happen. Its about 80 min of a whiny kid transforming from a rebel to a leader, and ten minutes of alien invasion. Basically, a long preview for another movie or the game.

B000HF6XV8|4.0|Sweet little family film. This classic can be enjoyed at face value with your family. It's also a movie about healing from damaging core beliefs.<br />I know stories of a healing family does not an exciting movie make. But they did a great job of keeping our interest. The drama is tuned up, and it relies heavily on the reveal when introducing each character. It wasn't corny, but obvious enough that I didn't have to explain the plot too often to my 6 yr old boy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!! The characters are captivating! Loved everything about this book! I want more from this author.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Seriously whoever said the movie is based on the book needs to stop. Im sure it was bit they are entirely different stories. In fact i wouldnt mind a movie actually going scene for scene with this book. It could be done. PKD is awesome and shows just what really great sci fi writing is about. Never read PKD read this first.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Found this book through a facebook recommendation. Just finished reading\\"the Host\\", another tale of the last days of human kind. What a contrast! Howey' s characters are folksie but rich with feeling. Meyers tried to achieve the same thing, but hers seemed wooden and vanilla.<br />  In Wool, everyone was flawed, but not stupid(aren't we all a little dumb every once in awhile), which I loved. I connected with every character, and respected the big choices that were made on both sides....not sure I could have had the courage. Suspense full, elegant, and a little Shakespeare thrown in the mix...what more could you ask for?<br />  ...thank you Hugh!

I imagine this dvd has a lot to offer a professional as well. Even the yoga sections are very fun. I found the workout quite satisfying and the dancing challenging and fun.
B004SEUIWY|4.0|A very funny film which is nothing but a patchwork of Grimm characters and Grimm fairy tales, all mixed up and all crisscrossed together with some unavoidable details or situations, though there is no kissing of frogs, yet a little bit of licking a toad, and of course the kissing of a princess who is a witch and yet a princess and finally the kissing of a Grimm brother by the witch princess, or is it Veronica, and all that works.<br /><br />Nature is totally crazy with walking trees, burning forests and magic towers in the middle of a bewitched country. The Grimm Brothers are nothing but perambulating crooks that make believe they can kill or capture witches and other wizards and free villages of all the bad demons they can imagine. There are so many suckers in this world that the Grimm brothers or their modern equivalents can make a fortune and at the same time have great fun. Walt Disney or Miramax are the least offensive ones among those.<br /><br />But nothing is simple in Germany in 1811 under the occupation of Napoleon's troops. The frogs are no longer the jumping neobatrachias we enjoy in ponds and other lakes, but these strange human beings wearing tricolor feathers on their heads and advocating the non existence of fairies, witches and other supernatural beings inhabiting the minds of superstitious simple minded people. They are not afraid of what does not exist though they are ready to fight a real battle against that haunted forest.<br /><br />The Frenchies have also brought with them snails and they use them to torture good Germans who cannot stand snails of course, whereas Frenchies are eating them, generally cooked in some tomato stew. There are all kinds of tastes in this world but Frenchies sure have the most surprising - and disgusting - ones.<br /><br />Entertaining and never really humdrum because of the innumerable distortions performed on the tales we know they introduce at every single moment of the story. And they destroy the witch who believes she is the most beautiful girl in the world since her mirror is telling her so with the typical action dictated by the simple logic of a child: break her mirror and she will be shattered into smithereens.<br /><br />And then they can be happy finally like good boys and good girls and we will not speak of the children they will make because after all we are working for a family audience and in a world where marriage is for everyone and not only for those who can collect little babies in lilies or whatever other flower or accept babies delivered to them by some storks. Let the others adopt some orphans.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUs she is the most beautiful girl in the world since her mirror is telling her so with the typical action dictated by the simple logic of a child: break her mirror and she will be shattered into smithereens.<br /><br />And then they can be happy finally like good boys and good girls and we will not speak of the children they will make because after all we are working for a family audience and in a world where marriage is for everyone and not only for those who can collect little babies in lilies or whatever other flower or accept babies delivered to them by some storks.

B00BTHWFHE|3.0|Black Sabbath's newest record is a masterpiece. Yes, a masterpiece. These guys don't seem to age at all, and they sound as good as they've ever sounded here. This could easily be a follow-up to 'Paranoid' or 'Master of Reality.' Geezer's bass lines are as creative as they've ever been, Ozzy sounds amazing (shocking when you consider all the abuse he has put himself through throughout the years), and Tony Iommi? Well what can you say? The guy is the riff master, and his riffing abilities are on full display throughout this album. He's a guitar genius, and you can see it very clearly here.<br /><br />I saw these guys in concert last month and they kicked some major behind. They rocked. They blazed through the hits (like 'Iron Man') and sounded easily as good as they did in 1971 and they dug deep into the catalogue with other tracks like 'Under the Sun' (from 'Vol. 4'). The new songs sounded amazing in concert, with 'God is Dead?' and 'End of the Beginning' being highlights.<br /><br />The tracks here are expertly written and performed. This is Sabbath at their best, minus Bill Ward. Brad Wilk is a more than able replacement, as he shows throughout. He's not as jazzy a player as Ward is, but he still plays in a way that is appropriate. This is definitely the classic Sabbath sound. Throughout the record, it is unmistakably Sabbath. Just listen to 'Methademic,' featuring an amazing acoustic intro played by Iommi. It then goes full speed ahead into a blazing rocker, with Ozzy singing his brains out. If one had no idea about the history of this band, they'd think Ozzy was 24, not 64.<br /><br />This is easily a five star album. So why the three stars?<br /><br />Well, the mastering flat out sucks. This is, hands down, one of the worst recordings I've ever heard. I've heard some bad ones too, including the recent Rolling Stones remasters, the new Queensryche record, and even the 2007 Genesis remasters. But this one is a special case.<br /><br />As other reviewers have accurately stated, there is compression, distortion, and yes, even clipping throughout this CD. It is truly awful mastering, courtesy of Rick Rubin. Rubin, once considered to be one of the great producers, has been behind some truly awful-sounding recordings as of recently. Metallica's 'Death Magnetic' (a great album and a return to form that was destroyed by the \\"loudness war\\"), the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 'I'm With You' (a rock solid album that is compressed from start to finish), and even ZZ Top's much awaited album 'La Futura' (their first album in 9 years -- and it's great, too -- was destroyed by the awful mastering). Rick Rubin was considered one of the great producers, but lately, his work has been shoddy at best.<br /><br />For an example, listen to 'God is Dead?.' The track starts out with a \\"quiet\\" passage (still mastered loudly) and then the toms kick in, and the distortion is incredible. Literally, it will ring in your ears if your volume is turned up loud enough. Even with the volume low, the distortion is incredible. It's almost deafening. \\"Ear fatigue\\" doesn't even begin to do it justice.<br /><br />'End of the Beginning' also features tons of distortion as well, and 'Zeitgeist,' a quiet, 'Planet Caravan'-type track, also has some distortion in parts. This is a terrible shame, because this is easily a contender for album of the year this year, but it is barely listenable.<br /><br />Rush is coming out with a remix of their heavily distorted 2002 album 'Vapor Trails.' This is supposed to correct many of the mastering and loudness issues that surround it. Somewhere down the road, a remix of this and other recent Rubin productions might not be a bad idea.<br /><br />I don't know what's gotten into Rubin. Johnny Cash's American Recordings sound great. Rubin's work on the two Red Hot Chili Peppers '90s albums are great ('One Hot Minute' and 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik,' but 'Californication' is a mess from a production standpoint). Hell, call me crazy, but I don't find his recent work with Slayer deafening either (although lately Rubin has only been credited as \\"executive producer,\\" so his involvement on the record is questionable). But lately, his work has been a distorted, overcompressed mess.<br /><br />Overall, this is a spectacular album. Ozzy, Geezer, and Tony sound as good as they've ever sounded on this album. It would appear that these guys will never get old. You could easily fool someone into thinking this record came out in the '70s. It is as if they haven't missed a step since 'Never Say Die!.' But, it's been absolutely destroyed by the \\"loudness war.\\" This is a great album that has been horrendously mixed.<br /><br />5 stars for the music, 1 star for the mastering. That comes to three stars. I hate to do this, but I'm forced to.<br /><br />And by the way, if anyone gets the chance, go see these guys in concert while you still can. The tickets are worth every cent. These guys are playing as good as they've ever played, and Ozzy still has it. Add Black Sabbath to your \\"must see\\" list.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I like to see beyond the story and I think while a great & entertaining movie that I'd recommend, it also says alot about the world we live in today.  It just depends on if you want to think that deeply about it.  If you don't want to go any deeper than the movie itself, enjoy it because it's a great movie I'd recommend.

B008RJFRTK|5.0|Works great with my 5&#34; tablet. You can freely download maps for each state or country that you are in or visiting. These maps can be used off line without any internet or phone connection. It easily makes use of my tablets build in GPS pin pointing my location and tracking it as I move about. I have used this in the car on trips, bike rides and on the trail hiking. The maps while not all complete are pretty good and they are improving them all the time. You can (at least on my tablet) zoom in and out on the maps easily. Checking your location and ensuring you are on the right track. Many times it has saved me from getting lost, doing a quick check with the program only to find I'm closer to my desired location then I thought.<br /><br />Now this program is NOT a &#34;Tom Tom&#34; like GPS where it gives you step-by-step instructions. It does NOT talk to you at all. What it does is just provides you with downloadable maps, on which the program will show your current location using you devices built in GPS hardware. It does NOT track your movements! But it (the Pro version) does allow you to place a marker on the map for any location you wish to remember, such as where you parked your car. You can zoom in, to any location on the map, helping you to plan your trip.<br /><br />I just used it on a trip across two states and it tracked my movement with no issues at all. It even had the trails in the National Park I was visiting also.<br /><br />I great simple program, that while it doesn't do much, what it does do, it does right!<br /><br />Not much different between the free version and the pro version. The pro just adds a search function (for food, stores, attractions. etc.) and the ability to place markers on the maps. But after using the free version for a couple of years felt that $5 was a fair price to pay for the couple of extras features. The maps are updated regularly and lets you know when there is an update for those that you have on your device.

1609611543|5.0|My Gastroenterologist strongly suggested that I read this book and it was recommended to him by his physician.  It seems we both had the same reaction - If we didn't have to change our diet, we still would!  I was astounded by the information provided in this book.  My sister has a severe case of RA, rashes and itching among  a plethora of other ailments.  I strongly recommended the book to her, which she purchased and now can't put it down and is in the process of changing her diet.  My son knows how sick he gets eating wheat, but is in college and has no extra time for book reading so the only thing cut out so far is wheat bread.  I try to counsel him, but you know hoe that goes! I wish they had the book on tape so , maybe he would listen to it on his way to school!  I tell everyone about it.

0740797719|4.0|This book by Dinotopia author, James Gurney, explores the realist painter's most essential tools: color and light.  Mr. Gurney's many years of acclaimed oil painting experience are behind this carefully crafted study on the best way to render color and light in paintings.<br /><br />The book deals with color in a very practical sense, including rethinking the color wheel, mixing colors, and the history of pigments.  Mr. Gurney also helps to remove some of the confusion in setting up an appropriate and workable palette.<br /><br />I found the lessons on sources of light, visual perception, atmospheric effects, and his explanation of how light reacts with surfaces and other elements to be both helpful and fascinating.  You'll find information on gamut mapping, underpainting, glazes, and the painting of hair to name just a few.  There are numerous techniques and painting tips scattered throughout the book.<br /><br />The various theories of color and light are demonstrated on beautiful color depictions of James Gurney's own paintings as well as the work of a number of other accomplished artists who have perfected the portrayal of color and light in their own paintings.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly informative and enjoyable book and I highly recommend it to any artist working to improve their own paintings.

B00E6F155E|5.0|I was really frustrated this was not released sooner but it was likely smart strategy and we are benefitting from recent restoration and processing technology. I honestly don't know if there's a more powerful and meaningful live show available. While [[ASIN:B007XNAQL0 Peter Gabriel: Secret World - Live [Blu-ray]]] is excellent and offers more theatrical elements, it was photographed in 16mm and the graininess is a bit revealing on Blu-ray. Live in Athens was photographed in 35mm and the impact is stunning. The Athens show captures emotional music played by elite musicians. Manu Katche's drumming is so musical while Tony Levin, David Sancious and David Rhodes are all superhuman.<br /><br />Also worth noting, we finally get to see and hear Youssou N Dour's opening set with his band Le Super Etoile de Dakar which, alone, might be worth the discs's price.<br /><br />I paid just over $20 in 1990 for the VHS so the $18 Blu-ray disc is a bargain.

193700788X|2.0|I have read much about the hate that has flowed Charlaine's way since the release of the final SOOKIE book-----------are we happy with the ending, no ,but we were not writing the books.  My gut tells me that this beloved author was suffering from the absolute mess that HBO made of her characters in the series TRUE BLOOD.  I must admit that I was fond of the initial season and felt that the writers were sticking close enough to the story and more importantly the characters that we had come to love.  As the series progressed things went from bad to worse..........I am not a prude but really, so much of the sex and/or nudity was unnecessary and sometimes even laughable to the point of embarasment.  Why the writers felt compelled to go in the direction they did is beyond me--the story was great as it stood, what showed up on HBO was laughable and sometimes just plain ugly.  I think that had they been MY stories, MY characters, I would have been sick at heart to see what happened to them and I feel that is what happened to Charlaine.  She has moved on to other characters and storylines that she has control over.  Yes, I am sure she was well paid for the rights to the series but she certainly did not have creative control---someone purchasing the books because they actually LIKED the series (which I and my daughter-in-law took to calling the \\"White Trash Series\\" or WTS for short)would be very surprised at the storyline of the books because they are SO different.  There were so many great characters in these books that never came to light in the series, they really missed the boat on that and , yes, I know it has a good following but I have no idea why.  As a big fan of George R.R. Martin I have been more impressed with the care HBO has taken with this massive work and feel that with the exception of a few miscastings they have done a much better job of it. Bottomline, no, I was not happy with this final book but I was not happy with the last 3 overall and I think the author had really lost interest , I do, however, look forward to the final book coming out this October and will be anxious to see her resolutions for so many of the great characters in this series.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very creative bingo game that has a wide variety of different themed rooms.  It doesn't get boring.  Slot rooms are fun too.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Masterpiece Theater does it again!  If you liked Upstairs/Downstairs, you'll like this.  I hope they continue the series.  I will certainly watch it.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|Horror, but not gore.  Intelligent plot.  Liked it much better than I thought I would!  Not for kids, obviously, but if you some thing that will keep you on the edge of your seat, with characters that you like, and no gore for the sake of gore, then this is a good flick for you
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Samsung swipe that came with my Galaxy 1 was better than this.  Perhaps I just got more used to it, but it seemed to be much better at predicting words.  I find that with Swiftkey, if you see the word that you want, you have to STOP at that letter or the word will change, even if you slide your finger over the right characters.  Or and Our is a problem every time, it seems to always choose OR and not give OUR as an option...  Perhaps it'll get better with time?
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the variety of dragons and habitats. Though I wish some of the extras weren't so expensive for a virtual object I understand that there are costs involved in making it available to us. Not to mention that these purchases are totally optional. I do love the game.
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|I remember seeing Field of Dreams in the theater when it first came out.  I was one of the very last to leave the theater.  I could not stop crying.  Though I've seen it too many times to count, there as never been a time when I did not tear up at the end.  It is that rare film that one can watch over and over, and still feel the magic.  All recollection of having seen it before evaporates and one is swept away to Iowa all over again.
B00915G6MG|5.0|We love our tenth season and have already watched it twice. I'm sure we will be watching it again as we have done with the previous seasons 1 - 9 that we purchased.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time!  Very well-made and great acting from all cast members.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I couldn't put the book down! It kept me in suspense all the time so I'm excited to read the next book!!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Cried, laughed,then cried some more. GRR Martin has even made me afraid to watch television. I'm in constant fear of characters dying suddenly.
B00EY8ARYS|5.0|Ok I'm a big fan of the avengers movie and I love firefly which was done by Whedon as well. So when I hear Agents of Shield I'm all in and can't wait to watch this show. What could be better then highly trained operatives mingling with superheroes and villians. Nothing! So I'm going to have the popcorn ready when this airs.<br /><br />Now for the Predictions:<br /><br />It's Not Good - Right off the pat I noticed the logo looks like it was done by cartoon network. ABC is a family channel and I hope to god they don't make this into some sort of power rangers deal. As I look at it I'm seeing the typical jock character, the rebel bad girl, the asian kung fu chick, a tech geek, and a geekette. All under the command of a familiar face who will no doubt play caretaker to this group.<br /><br />Characters have perfect makeup and look as if they could play high school seniors in another ABC show about a senior year in highschool. They are all dress like JCPenny models and are devoid of tattoos, unique style, or anything that suggests professional badass. They look like the cast of GLEE more than members of the worlds most secret and advanced spies/agents.<br /><br />Here is to hoping this doesn't kill the show!!!!<br />PS- If you disagree or agree with my view of the cast please comment. I'd want to like this but I just don't have faith in the cast to deliver. Change my mind!<br /><br />****** UPDATE 5 STARS*****<br />WHEDON DELIVERS!!! The cast may not be that imaginitive but the interactions are perfect. I am going to leave my earlier post intact for now but stereotypes aside this show is Firefly meets Avengers and its done SO WELL!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|If you want a book that makes you think - this is the book!  I could not put it down and when I had to, all I could do was think, think, think!  I highly recommend not only this book but any book written by this author.
B0024FADDI|5.0|Great DVD of fun flick.  Perhaps not everyone's bag, but most people can get into it. Time travel, zombies, chain saws.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Even though emojis don't go on kindles it is still a supper FUN game. I recommend buying it.plus the emojis are easy to understand
B00005JN8Z|5.0|When the Roman Empire &#34;WAS SUPPOSEDLY INVINSIBLE&#34;, we, the human beigns, that are imperfect, believe, especially &#34;THE EMPERORS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE THAT THEY WERE GODS&#34;!!!!!!!!!!! Wrong my friends, a special person comes, from heaven, and demostrate the opposite, that only God is &#34;PERFECT&#34;. I'm speaking of Jesus, speaking about our &#34;FATHER(GOD)&#34;, about the real love, to love the enemy, destroy the &#34;ROMAN EMPIRE&#34;.<br />  Of course, the &#34;ROMAN EMPEROR NERON&#34;, that was crazy, materialistic, egocentristic, believeing &#34;HE WAS GOD(JA,JA,JA)&#34; destroy Rome with fire, murderer of his own people, and then accuse the &#34;CHRISTIANS OF BERNING ROME(THIS IS HISTORY)&#34;, but love prevailed. &#34;AN EXTRAORDINARY PICTURE, FIVE(5)STARS&#34;!!!!!!!!!!ARTHUR.
B000UNYK76|1.0|Wasn't able to watch the video because it not coded for US DVD players. Im pretty disappointed. Awesome*<br /><br />*not awesome
8866135879|5.0|Best purchase ever! I never wanted to buy because of a high price, however, the quality is amazing!  I will always recommend this product.
B00E3BK0QQ|2.0|When you try to play it, it doesn't work.  You can't get beyond the first screen.  I do not like it.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I could not stop reading. The previous book ended without an ending so I had to start reading this immediately. The author shows the loving relationship between the characters like a roller coaster while several other things happen around them at same time in a way that I could not stop reading. It is a pity that the next book will take so long to be released.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  this app its great for my little sister. she loves her horses... its a woonderfil app no issues
B007IXWKUK|5.0|AWSOME. Can't wait to read book three in the series but I am a little worried  to do so for Christian
B008US4PBY|5.0|I bought GTA 5 for my PS3 and I'm loving it but the control layout was killing my right hand. My hands are kind of large, and having to reach forward for the R2 & L2 triggers put the PS3 controller so far back in my hand that I couldn't reach back to the \\"X\\" button without discomfort in my thumb joint.<br /><br />So I ordered the Cronus and the Microsoft XBox 360 Wireless Receiver from Gimika yesterday afternoon after researching how to use an XBox 360 controller on a PS3. My order shipped within a few hours and I received it this afternoon.<br /><br />1st let me say my experience was 99% plug-n-play. Connected the Cronus to the PS3 with a USB extension, connected the receiver to the Cronus, powered on the PS3 with the console button, powered on the XBox controller, then paired it with the receiver. The controller was immediately recognized and I was able to navigate the PS3 menus and launch GTA 5.<br /><br />After GTA 5 loaded, I had the one and ONLY problem I've experienced - GTA reported that no wireless controller was detected :(  I checked and the XBox controller had paired as controller #2, so I quit GTA, powered off the controller, then powered it back on.  This time (and every time since) it connected as Controller #1 and GTA sees it with no probs.<br /><br />As others report, I have experienced NO lag at all. It's no different than using the PS3 controller, except that it's a LOT more comfortable since the XBox controller is sized for adult hands whereas PS3 controller is sized for 6-year old hands ;)<br /><br />All buttons work exactly as they should right out of the box, the device knows it's connected to a PS3 and an XBox controller and automatically applied the correct mapping. I haven't tried using the mapping software yet but I'm looking forward to that - there are a number of games I've played where I would have given anything to be able to remap controls to my liking the way you can do in any PC game. With the ability to remap every button and storeup to 9 profiles onboard, it should be no problem to map the controls however you like for any game.<br /><br />I was concerned about some of the negative reviews I've seen here, but my experience is 100% positive. Wouldn't hesitate to purchase again!
0345803485|1.0|Bought the trilogy....big mistake! Could barely read the drivel in first book, but did so as I wanted to get my money's worth (I'm Scottish!) skimmed through second and have no intention of wasting my time reading the 3rd.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Challenging to get all those Pigs!<br /><br />Lots of different levels to try different solutions.  The physics are pretty good.  Fun!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite movies and one that the parents can enjoy as well.  The characters are adorable. We have watched it a million times and plan on getting the sequel as well.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It's a heart warming story of a little girl and a boy. Inspiring too. But I can't agree with it's constant attributing of the little girl's sickly look to climate in India, after all Indian children don't look so. It's all got to with her parents' inattention I would say. Even so it's a lovely book for children to read and I as an adult enjoyed it just as much and felt like I was also in the moor with them.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|its a fun game and was a lil hard to get used to at first. now i really enjoy paying it and helps pass time at the docs office
0062255657|2.0|The book really wasn't what I expected. While it arrived in perfect condition as promised, I feel that the description is far from what the book truly entails. I'm not really into sci-fi novels, and while many reviews stated the book could not be put down, I found it very easy to stop reading and hard to follow. It was written terrifically, just not my cup of tea.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Definitely worth a watch if you like sci fi types of shows. It begins to grow on you and you get accustom to the characters, some pissing you off and others who you love.
B00C1BV9Z6|3.0|Pretty horrible movie. The saving grace, of course, is the special effects and surround sound. Watched this with my three year older and I forgot how gory and scary it was. She stopped watching it half way through. I had seen it before so I didn't finish it either. Cool movies if your kid is older and into dinosaurs.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Definitely worth a watch if you like sci fi types of shows. It begins to grow on you and you get accustom to the characters, some pissing you off and others who you love.  Would love to se what eventually happens to Eli!
B003QTWR08|5.0|Great Disney movie. Great soundtrack. Great characters. My favorite Disney movie that doesn't feel like a Disney movie. A lot of the comedy is geared towards adults. Tries to teach us a lesson about our compulsive purchasing society.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I bought the book on a recommendation from my sister. It accurately depicts the first time falling in love/high school emotions. Technically, it's historical because it happens in the '80s, but I believe kids today can relate. Also, the broken family aspect can be applied cross-culturally and I'm sure my students would enjoy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. . It's very informative for any location I wish to find and I can store places I go to often to see what the weather is like before I travel. A must have for travelers
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great! Just like a real calculator...oh wait, it IS a real calculator!  Does everything I want in a calculator.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan you have done it again!<br />I never thought I would be reading novels so huge with no pictures untill I read \\"the Lightening thief \\" Then I wanted to read the next one and the next one all the way up to the house of Hades .(I just pre-order it )<br />In this book I learn about Annabeth's personality which was killing me ever since the Lightening thief how Annabeth thinks about Percy. And I was so happy when Percy practically proposed to Annabeth.(sorry I am a major percabeth fan)<br />The fight seems were so awesome! I mean Percy and Jason WOW! And the book was mostly funny! It was like in every chapter I have to laugh. I didn't really enjoy the last part because of the twist but at the same time I enjoy it!<br /> It was a very smart way tend the book.<br />But really want Leo and Hazel point of view in the house of Hades  rick<br />PLEASE<br />And  another Percy Jackson series please<br />Percy Jackson is better than Kane chronicles sorry Rick!<br />The truth is the truth
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|I didn't see this movie at the theaters because the trailers were not enticing. Decided to give it a shot on Amazon and I was pleasingly surprised.  The movie has several unexpected twists. I was happy that I could rewind a few times which is obviously impossible in the theater.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It made me think and it was a fun way to pass the time.  It was very engaging without being boaring
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Everything about it is so lavish. The costumes, the acting, the camera work. It's a soap opera...but with so much more.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I just loved the book. It kept your interest all the way to the end. Did not want to put it down.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this app is great ii have nothing more to say all my friends love it and so do I I love this app
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|Please let me play some more. I love this game and would love to pay more. Please keep making game lick this one.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|Even though the book moved very slowly in the first part, it took off in the second part.  He draws the characters and scenery with such clarity, that I really could identify the hardships so fully.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I plan my TV viewing on Wednesday around this program.  My only disappointment is that it is not repeated during the week.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  It is an ongoing story so you have to watch it from the first episode.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I read this book because of all the great reviews and they are not lying. This book took me all over the emotional spectrum. I felt bad for the first family killed in the first chapter. I understood the killers motivation. (lets face it who hasn't felt like hurting someone for wasting their time.), I fell in love with the Jesse character and how she had to work her way through a sea of men keeping her down. This book is a must read for anyone over the age of 17. not a great book for younger people based on the amount of graphic violence in the murder scenes.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|This is one of the least interesting movies ever filmed.  Releasing it online before &#34;buzz&#34; killed it in the movie was a masterful ploy to extract 87 more cents from the public than had it gone straight to the airlines.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Okay, there's a lot of flaws in this movie. The acting is waaay over done, but if you can push past that the movie is pretty enjoyable.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|This is a very nicely written and acted mystery that explores its characters and their motives with great insight.  An interesting series that is worth watching!
B00F35B8F8|4.0|The special effects were good,  plenty of action. It was a good movie. This new Star Trek series is awesome!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Had to use closed captioned to fully understand everything they said but  the series soon became one of my favorites.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Ok so I like this and all, but it is so annoying! Often it wont let me open the dang app! I will click on the icon, and it will go into he wpp but then it will go back to main screen and a not pops up sayong, vTube has stopped working, GRR! But other than that I like it.
B000CDINOK|5.0|I had to buy an all-region DVD Player to watch this DVD of Muse at Glastonbury but it was well worth the extra $50 to be able to see this performance; it is one I've watched over and over.<br /><br />Muse throw themselves into every song and sound crisp, vibrant and edgy. The night is chilly and you can see Matt's breath as he sings and the steam rising from the large moving crowd. The atmospherics of the night, a few flags waving in the crowd, the accompanying light show and the editing work very well to make the concert visually captivating and unique. At times the crowd sings along with the songs, but the audio mix keeps a good balance. The video editing is interesting and at varied pace.<br /><br />The Glastonbury set is about 1 hour with a great playlist: Hysteria, New Born, Sing for Absolution, Muscle Museum, Apocalypse Please, Ruled by Secrecy, Sunburn, Butterflies and Hurricanes, Bliss, Time is Running Out, Plug In Baby, and Blackout. The entire set is excellent; the external world drops away as you are drawn into the music and event. The joy of the singing crowd on the choruses of Time is Running Out and Plug In Baby coupled with the awesome atmospherics of the chilly night elevate the concert to a powerful level for its finale. Muse returns for an encore with the haunting Blackout with stunning guitar work by Matt. If you are a Muse fan you'll love this concert.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think the game is great. The only thing I would change is, if you are consistantly winning you should be awarded tokens instead of losing them.
6305161992|5.0|I really like this movie, Brandon Lee at his best with Dolph Lundgren, hope you guys like it as much as I did
0545265355|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with The Hunger Games Trilogy. It has been by far one of the best series I have read. I would rate this up there with Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings, because it is so good. Suzanne Collins is an excellent author, who really brings you into the life and culture of panem. I read the paperback books from the local library, and decided to buy my own hardback set. Great books and will definitely need to be a must read for everyone! Would suggest this book 100% to anyone!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have played this game in many different companies games and was very disappointed with their choice of how you play it, but this one hits the bull's eye.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers moscow is so awesome! Just watch out for the Russian nesting dolls. Ahhh...<br />Everyone needs this app! Buy it for your own good!Cool!
6305882592|5.0|Am very pleased with this purchase from Amazon. It's one of those cult classics that's just good to have in my library to watch from time to time.  An all time favorite.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This is the best app I ever got but survival craft is a bit better I wish I can put 5and a half<br />Stars
0062255657|1.0|This is probably one of these stories where you have to read between the lines to get the deeper meaning. I'm guessing that the people and events all symbolize something.<br />But whatever it is that this book is about, I didn't get it.
B001B67VR2|5.0|love all her music and glad I got it as it is worth every penny.  Great songs on here and one you will play over and over.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I like the full features, but it can be frustrating when it freezes. If I go back to mobile version it works better. Full version freezes constantly.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved it and enjoyed the period costumes. Fell in love with the characters.will likely eatvh it over and over again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful - can't wait for Season 5.  Very entertaining and worth watching.  Great history and great characters - well done!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love the unusual and this show has that.  The acting is great. I just wish I had started watching this when it first came out.
B00E193TM2|4.0|Maybe just a tad heavy than what I am used, to but I really enjoy their music. Definitely glad I bought this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love it. I cant help watching it. will be sad when the 3 series ends on my kindle. even joined amazon prime. free to watch it this way and also the perks  of free shipping and others like getting book and movies free or cheaper. I was number 50 at the library to see 2 or 3 series. couldn't wait that long. Hope 4 comes live on pbs
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Do not let anyone stop you from doing something that is supposed to be.  Be free to be who you are meant to be.
B0055S348W|5.0|This product works as advertised. I am now able to print documents to my home printer from my tablet through wifi. Great app!
B00456PKG4|5.0|Step outside your box and accomplish great things.  There is life to be lived outside the routine of each day.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|Chilling. What a brilliantly crafted novel that keeps you guessing until the last. Not an ideal read for late night/early morning feeding sessions with a newborn, I can tell you! But very difficult to put down.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|In a world that needs more heroes this is a great watch.  Unity accomplishes great things. Find time for this one,
B004S5FW1U|5.0|I read this after seeing the film, and thoroughly enjoyed it! Pat's voice is engaging and while you occasionally want to shake him for his dogged belief in a happy ending, he is a likeable character. The mother's character is explored in more depth in the novel than in the film, and it is richer for it.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This is a great series! The 2005 revival of Doctor who is amazing. The acting is well done and for many this doctor will be their first doctor. The adventures shared between the two in this series are simply amazing! and i will not forget this anytime soon. I recently started watching this series a month back, and i am already into the The third series.<br /> But, I have decided to go back and rewatch the first series with this doctor again simply for the memories. What brought me back to the series was actually its first episode with the mannequins. I saw that way back when it was first brought back in 2005. that one scene stuck with me throughout the years and i could not remember where it was from! after racking my mind and talking to a few people, I discovered the doctor.<br /> I give this series a 10/10 a must watch for new fans and old! take my word for it, i'm the doctor! ha ha!
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Our daughter-in-law calls this a &#34;chick-flick&#34;. No matter, BOTH my wife and I thought this movie was one of the best we had seen for some time. If you are looking for action, it isn't there, but the characterization was superb. The movie depicted much of the '50s-south very well. And I might say, at least to a subtler degree, the relationship and division that was shown in &#34;the Help&#34; between the whites and the blacks was also found in the north as well. Sad, but true. It makes one wonder how humans can show so much disregard to others they deem inferior, especially  when they see themselves as &#34;Christians&#34;. Although we as a nation still have a ways to go to completely eradicate that mind set, fortunately we have come a long ways toward greater acceptance toward others of different color and beliefs as us. Hopefully this movie will further &#34;the Help&#34; to bring bout continued change. Great directing! Great acting by all the actors and actresses. Hats off to all and  thank you.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great story happy and sad at the same time Dave is one talented man. He does great interviews and tells a great story
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Star Trek fan forever. Love the story line base on all the old movies. Can't wait to see how they play out the next story line.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. I was only disappointed by the abruptness of its ending. Would still recommend to anyone looking for a good flick.
B00D3LA5WG|5.0|Mud is a story line of a man that's not sure where he stands with the world and running from the law and a woman keeps you riveted.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Great story line/plot carried all the way through. Enjoyed it twice. Leaves the door open for the next saga.<br />Acting is great and quality of audito and video is outstanding.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|The 3rd season of a riveting suspense story that leaves you on the edge of your seat wondering what or who next dies in the scheme of events.

B004UID2LC|4.0|Works great on my 7&#34; tablet.  Ads not too annoying at top of screen.  Good search feature and lots of suggestions from recent popular vids.  Love it.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Knowing and seeing are two different things. In the future is not a pretty picture. But there can be life and wonders around the corner. Just waiting to happen
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Well organized review of current studies regarding women in the workplace with a lot of personal experiences to fill out the book.  I really enjoyed reading Sheryl Sandberg's book and feel better equipped to approach my progressing career.
B00000J2SS|4.0|Remastering has done very well for the sound quality of this classic live album.  I've owned previous CD and cassette versions and was always very disappointed with the mix which tended to drown out the performance with incidental sounds and a copious amount of hiss.  But this particular edition fixes both problems admirably.  Also, previously removed tracks from the single-CD version are now thankfully restored.<br />As to the content:  Let's face it, most people considering buying this have already owned and listened to Final Vinyl many times.  But if you're just discovering Rainbow, I would say this is a nice introduction, including performances from all three periods within their classic era.  With the focus decidedly on the more arena-rock styled Joe Lynn Turner period, you also have two tracks with Graham Bonnett (disappointingly, only one is live, while the other is an admittedly good studio B-side) and then closing out with two high-energy, extended-length metal classics from the original Ronnie James Dio period.  Through all, you can hear the high degree of musicianship of a classic Rainbow concert no matter what style they were more focused on at any given time.  Sequencing is a bit haphazard; at first glance it appears to be roughly reverse-chronological order except for the fact that the Bonnett pieces actually are in the middle of the Joe Lynn Turner set.  But the material here is so good that it ceases to be a distraction once you're into it.<br />Another thing that makes this album worth owning is the live version of &#34;Difficult to Cure&#34;.  With an added &#34;Arabian Nights&#34;-type passage, a symphony orchestra and a just tighter performance, it blows away the fun-but-awkward studio version from the album of the same name.  Here it's elevated to the level of masterpiece.<br />Thirdly, aside from the aforementioned Bonnett-era studio B-side, &#34;Bad Girl&#34;, there are two other excellent studio B-sides thrown in as bonuses-- the pulsating &#34;Jealous Lover&#34; featuring Turner, and the dramatic instrumental &#34;Weiss Heim&#34;, which is essential for any Blackmore fan.  It's similar to, though briefer than Deep Purple's &#34;Son of Alerik&#34;, if you've ever heard it.<br />If you are looking for a good introduction to Rainbow, this remastered live album is, in my opinion, better and more exciting than any of the studio compilations that have been released in recent years.  It's what hooked me to the point of buying everything in their back catalog.<br />The one complaint I have about this edition is the jacket art.  At least on my copy, it's a lousy reproduction.  Too dark and fuzzy-lined, as if someone just snapped a poorly-exposed picture of the 33 jacket, both inside and out, and sent it to press.  Part of what I always loved about the physical package was the very cool photos of various members of the band in action, as well as the moody cover.  But then again, maybe I just got a bum copy.  I can tell this is definitely not a forged bootleg....  But the most important part is the music: remastered, crystal-clear and big as life, so I'm still thrilled that I finally bought this.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I will watch movies because Matthew is in them.  Mud is good, but I didn't like the sadness in it.  It definitely kept my attention, and Matthew was excellent as always.
B00BSWMITK|5.0|A lot has been said about this album that I just can't say better, so I'm keeping this one brief.  After Engines of Creation, I was starting to get a bit bored with most of JS's studio output.  It seemed he was repeating himself too often, with enough exceptions on each album to keep me buying.  But Unstoppable Momentum really changes that.  Some really creative experimental stuff going on here and compositions that mostly feel like a breath of fresh air.  Recommended!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great read and I thought Fifty Shades was the best, how wrong was I. Again, if you enjoyed fifty shades, this series is one not to be past. The main characters, Eva and Gideon, WOW! That being said, now onto the third and last book in this series, how sad.
159463176X|5.0|My book club read this book. This is the second book we've read by Khaled Hosseini who is an excellent writer. This book did not disappoint us.

B000002ADT|5.0|I love Miles Davis! This is Jazz! Not &#34;Smooth Jazz&#34;! I agree it's not for everyone. Some of the cuts were not as crisp as others, but still an amazing CD.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is way better than the movie because it gives more detail on how the story came to be. Read it then tell me if the movie is that good.
B001IZZEEI|5.0|The Sex and the City: The Movie The Wedding Collection Ultimate Collector's Edition is awesome! One thing that it does not say in the description is that it also includes digital copy. I would recommend this for anyone who loves Sex and the City. It is also a must have for any one who loves having a complete collection!

B00F91SCXC|5.0|This movie was fun. I didn't read the book. I love Brad Pitt. I could've taken or left the family but overall it was a great way to kill a couple hours.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is challenging.  If you pay attention, you can win a lot more than you think.  At first I lost nearly every game until I started watching every play.  Spider solitaire helped me with this game.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|All my friends read this months ago and told me I had to read it - I finally did and what a great story!  The characters are vivid, the story relevant, and you'll be rooting for all of them.
B00DW5IM9Q|1.0|I was a dj when the first \\"Self Portrait\\" was released. And my reaction was as severe as Greil Marcus'. I refused to play a single cut on my \\"underground\\" show. As I recall, Dylan came into my life with \\"Bringing It All back Home\\". Then he got better on \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and stayed as high on \\"Blonde on Blonde\\". I loved \\"John Wesley Harding\\" too. \\"Nashville Skyline\\" dipped a bit and then the toilet flushed. On \\"Self Portrait\\", All the Tired Horses as side 1, cut 1, was prophetic, for the entire lp was tired. Fortunately he still had \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\" left in him. (We can't count The Basement Tapes\\" or Great White Wonder as official releases. Plus they were available out of sequence.)<br />Then Dylan pretty much became irrelevant with current releases. They did fairly well commercially because- - - - well, because he is Dylan. So by the time that \\"Time out of Mind\\" came out we were no longer comparing the current Dylan release with \\"Blond on Blonde\\" but with the trail of garbage he released beginning with \\"Street Legal\\" and reaching his height of bulls**t releases with \\"Good As I Been to You\\". So, \\"Time\\" appeared to be good. But only in comparison to the more recent releases. It can't hold it's own with his earlier releases. Now we accept Dylan not as the pioneer of the 60s but as a bad voiced crooner. Lord music critics are pathetic. They have to quit buying into the legend when reviewing any new release. And as that goes, \\"Tempest\\" was the most Dylanesque lp since the 70s.<br />If you're a completest I'm sure there are a couple of things here for you. But if you're not; skip this. As has been said by many, if something wasn't released prior to some later compilation, there is a good reason it wasn't.
B0065CCM76|5.0|If you like Bob you will  love this it is the best of the best because It has it all.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great entertainment for free. That's what your here for right? This gets the job done, so go have a blast.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I hardly ever finish a book that fast, and I never knew about the orphan train.
B0064MGU98|5.0|The goodwife has a series of story lines that come together very nicely and how it relates back to the individual problems of alicia and her husband.  Very entertaining and interesting as to the inner workings of this law firm.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have read a lot of Navy Seal books lately. In my opinion this one is right up there with Lone Survivor. I enjoyed this book from start to finish. This book gives just a snapshot of what these guys go through to become and work as Seals.<br /><br />After I finished the book I read some of the 1 and 2 star reviews. For the most part they made me want to puke. It's like they read a different book than this one.<br /><br />Read the book and make your own judgement, I for one don't believe you'll be disappointed!<br /><br />Thanks for your time.
B0056BMK6K|4.0|I found the marketing plan in this book to be easy to follow and understand. It made sense and I highly recommend any self publishing author read this! My only complaint would be that it frequently reads like a sales pitch for the book itself, but I do see the irony in this complaint :-)
B009BJAPLK|5.0|Enthralling. Fantastic. The British style of story telling is so sophisticated and engaging. I highly recommend this spectacular mystery series!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We missed the first 3 seasons during the regular schedule so we are catching up via Amazon.  We go from show to show and absolutely love it.  This is one of the series that we don't want to end.  It's fun to see how rich people lived in that era, the characters are realistic enough that we get 'involved' with them, and we are always looking forward to the next episode.  Very well done!
0345525558|3.0|I read this book but just didn't care for it very much so would not recommend it to anyone else.

B0094BB4TW|2.0|I mean really, I've had two updates from iTunes in the last 4 months, why can't Amazon keep up????  This version doesn't work nearly as well.
B009RX85N0|5.0|Loved the series! I love owning the series so I can re-watch the shows I liked. Highly recommend it for everyone!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is great because of the power ups. Also I like the challenges that make it really fun.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show, I love the characters, Harvey, Mike and Luis! Just finished Season 2 and can't wait to binge watch season 3!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I thought it was very confusing.It was cool that they played all these different parts.But i thought it was very hard to follow.
B00000FC5H|3.0|I have to admit that I was a little bit disappointed with this CD. My disappointment is not with Earth Wind & Fire,<br />but with the recording engineers and sound mixers who worked on most of the tracks. The one exception is the track<br />&#34;Let's Groove&#34;, which has great depth to it, full-range sound, and bass that will nearly shake your house off it's foundation. The rest of the tracks are very shallow sounding, and do not show off the band the way they should. If your idea of a great<br />sound system is a boom box, you'll love this CD. High quality sound system owners probably won't. Of course, there's<br />always equalization.
0316066524|5.0|\\"What's it about?\\" Vague questions deserve vague answers. I like to answer this one (Infinite Jest being one of the longer novels ever written, and my having finished it), with my legs crossed, cigarette in hand, looking off into steely midday overcast-type clouds and say, \\"the human condition, man.\\"<br /><br />  But it is, really. Silence any anxiety-inducing hype you may have heard about it's impossibly long, the word choice is esoteric and overbearing, it's just terribly smart, etc... Hmm... it is lengthy, it might send you on some internet/dictionary searches (I have a steno book full of definitions of new words that I couldn't just let slide, a pretty good idea if you're like me and can't bear passing over unknown words), and yes it's clever. What this means is you have to read this book with your full attention. This isn't a Ray Carver short story that you can read hungover w/coffee and then put down with some vaguely satisfying furthered knowledge of what it means to be in love. You have to have your brain into it.<br /><br />  After adjusting yourself to David's style, Infinite Jest reveals itself to be a vividly lucid read. He writes so clearly and misses not one section in time of the mind of his characters. Everything is honest, and as Dave Eggers points out in the foreword to my edition, there is not one lazy sentence. Jest's clearness heightens the joy of reading how-did-you-think-of-that descriptions of e.g. young American boys' penchant for getting underneath tunnels and caves v. older American boys' penchant for getting on top of things to look out over large expanses of territory. It magnifies the tragedy of passages about child abuse. It sends you deep inside yourself when he's describing depression, or filial love, or loneliness, or what it means to be an addict.<br /><br />  It's maybe more accurate to ask what it isn't about. That's easier to answer; there's not much it doesn't cover. It has mesmerizing takes on philosophy (the inner monologuesof a neurotic tennis academy student who enjoys the secret of getting high as much as the high itself and ruminates very deeply about what it means to be), political philosophy (via a mountaintop discussion between a paraplegic wheelchair assassin and a cross-dressed U.S. Agent), sexuality, dependence, comfort, horror, drugs, corporate desire, etc... All of this in fascinating, clear clear clear prose. It's really ridiculous.<br /><br />  Get into it - it's easy to do. It is heart rending, and hilarious, and in ways that I have not experienced before. Reading it is a magnetizing experience, it's consuming, it's a pleasure and a challenge. You know what I mean, \\"you'll laugh, you'll cry,\\" and so forth.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|Another great addition to the Harry Potter series of movies.  Watched it with the family, was a little scary for the younger kids (under 5) but older kids shouldn't find it scary at all.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Christian and Ana have it going on. The transformation of Grey is remarkable. Can't wait to read the third.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I Really enjoyed the book ! Makes you think about life . A quick read, I recommend it! Very touching !
B003V4AK8E|3.0|at first it was great allowed for extended gameplay but then not even a week went by the buttons started sticking but overall not bad gokds charge for a good while
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This story told by a five year old about &#34;room&#34; was sometimes difficult to read because as an adult we see a wider map with very recent news media blaring in our heads.  The mother is a wonderful one, but she pays a high price in her own sanity making the child innocent in his surroundings.  Well written.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't seen a show that kept me guessing. I love the whole story line. Keep this Show going. It's been a long time since one like this has been on
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I enjoyed Khaled Hosseini's other two books so much I knew I needed to read his third book.  The problems that poverty can present echo in the lives of them and their descendants.  The role of women and decisions of men can echo throughout their family history.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book was a great read. I loved the first one and this was just as good. Now to read the next.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|LOVED EVERY CHAPTER! Get ready to cry. This book will punch you right in the feels. Looking forward to the movie.
B00DU74U74|3.0|I was disappointed.  The movie was not as good as the book.  They left a lot of important scenes out.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was a little hard to get into as there were a few separate story lines going on. The payoff was to keep reading and they all came together as the book progressed. I enjoyed the book and the various characters.
140006922X|2.0|I regret that I had to give a poor rating to this book.  I suppose the author means well, but his ambition - first writing a book on Islam and then not only on Christianity but on the life and times of Jesus. The difficulty of this task requires enormous research and an intimate knowledge of languages - Aramaic, New testament Greek, and Hebrew in particular. I  bought the book to compare it with &#34;The authentic gospel of Jesus&#34; by Geza Vermes, to which there simply was no comparison. Sometimes ambition can lead to overreaching.
B007PFD90G|3.0|I landed in this book attracted by the fatwa episode and the underlying freedom of expression issues. And both are developed in the book with great detail and style. However, Rushdie is also constantly making his case throughout the pages (which is perhaps obvious), trying to set the account straight with many people. In addition, the book has a lot of juicy anecdotes and settings -lunch with Christopher Hitchens, dinner with Martin Amis, drinks with Susan Sontag... Very interesting but tiresome at times. It seems as if Rushdie and His ego couldn't help writing about every single episode under the sun in the writer's life. With 300 pages less, this would have been a five-star book.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Ian Flemming is back as the \\"real\\" James Bond, taking on another cool adventure set in the world of British espionage and World War Two.  This is the second book in the Ian Flemming Files and I think it's actually a step forward from the last novel, Operation Armada.  Armada had a great, big story with the attempt to destroy the French fleet before the Nazi's got to it.  Parsifal's story is more complex, more nuanced and political -- infiltrating a secret society that helps keep the Nazi's running behind the scenes.  Flemming's character is great, with all the flair and smarts that are clearly projected in his James Bond character.  It's fun to imagine this real guy, involved in what I assume is a real operation.  So, in that sense, great history lesson, great walk through time.  I think the writing in Parsifal is actually more sophisticated with beautiful imagery and some really thrilling moments that are painted in sharp detail.  A well done thriller, with great details and historical moments for an entertaining read.  I recommend reading both novels, very well done.
B000FCKPHG|5.0|The concept is simple, but hits deep.<br /><br />I've spent so much time in academia, but lost track of where I lost my natural curiosity in favor of &#34;performing&#34; as a &#34;good student.&#34;<br /><br />That's all changing right now.
1416972250|5.0|My teenager was so happy when she received her books!  It's nice to be able to please her so affordably.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|great story about slavery and the voices thereof. Realistic characters and story plot, characters are a little confusing at times but once into the book you are inside the Kitchen house as well. Great read!

B00DU77QP2|2.0|Everyone has to give a book a chance no matter how uninteresting a story starts.<br /><br />City of Bones by Cassandra Clare is one of those kinds of books. Everything about it, the plot, the characters, the dialogue, seemed all too cliche. However, the curiosity as to why this book is so popular kept nagging me which is why I kept on reading. The saving grace or what seemed like it happens in the middle part of the story. The book has a redeaming point, you just have to give it a chance and you'll get there eventually.<br /><br />However, in my opinion, I did not like the book much. Yes, it's action-packed and mysterious and makes me curious sometimes but I can't help but compare the book to The Hunger Games which is pretty much the same in the action-packed aspect of the story but very different in content of course. Although The Hunger Games has the same sort of alternate universe bit like City of Bones but there's a very big difference in the connectiona and feeling I had with the characters. I guess it's in how the story was written. Cassandra Clare failed to move me and connect me to the characters more and in the parts where she tried to make a reader more sympathetic to a character it felt overdone. I still felt detached even in the end of the book.<br /><br />In summary, it's worth a read if you're curious why this book is popular but it's not very memorable in my opinion.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I watched up to season 3 I'll leave off with episode 1 season 4 great show and the hd comes in great

B0097EWK3A|4.0|This game is the best,until you find out that you n need to buy the full game. The best part about it was the graphics.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|Great series!  Better than Magnum PI.  You must buy all in the collection and watch them in the correct order.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|Nate Silver is a colorful character. He has moved from being a transfer price consultant to professional poker play to NY times blogger. He purportedly made more than 100K a year playing poker when it was legal. I started taking poker lessons only to drop it because Human Resources folks like me are emotional  and cannot maintain a poker face. Nate Silver claim to fame was his ability to predict winner of the 2008 US presidential election and many Senate seats with unerring accuracy.<br /><br />He is also obsessed with Baseball statistics and developed an excel based program called PECOTA. I cannot understand the obsession. For readers who do, please do not take a bat to me :). Just kidding. I like the sport when it is break time :).<br /><br />Nate (As I have read his book, took the liberty to switch to first name) is a devotee of Bayesian theorem on probability. I will not go through intricacies of explaining the theorem because then I will have to stop pretending that I understand it.<br /><br />We all know the number of occurrences of an event in the past which is the prior. In Bayes probability theorem Prior plays a large role in predicting outcome.<br /><br />Prior is guess work and does not work in predicting an event like a toss of fair coin. Irrespective of the prior, the probability is going to 50 percent.<br /><br />Nate uses carefully chosen and stories to explain prediction.  Prediction is based on assumptions<br /><br />a. Like Prior, lot of other assumptions would predict an outcome.<br />b. The assumptions has a cascading effect. If you assume wrong, then it has disproportionate impact on the result.<br /><br />I particularly liked the chapter on Weather Prediction; when the probability of rain is 40% for any given day it means that the<br /><br />a. Weather forecaster used multiple assumptions in the model.<br />b. In 40% of the outcomes, it was predicted to rain.<br />c. TV weather forecasters have a wet bias. It is better to say it is going to rain rather than saying it will not and take flak for it. If your TV channel says that the precipitation forecast is 30%, then leave the umbrella at home (unless you live in Hilo, Hawaii which is the wettest place in the US)<br /><br />If you would like to read how earthquakes or terrorist strikes lines up mathematically, then this is the book for you. (I got bored with the chapter on Climate change, rest was fascinating)<br /><br />By the way, Nate’s truthfully claims that his method of predicting success in Baseball was a shade inferior then Baseball scouts who use statistical methods as well as skill to select teams.<br /><br />If you read this review and bought the book, send me few dollars as you have gained in knowledge. If you do not like the book, send me few dollars still so that I can stop predicting readers' taste and you will not buy books on my recommendation.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Great movie but you must see the first one to understand the second one.  Good addition to a movie collection. But you must buy both if you don't have the first one.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|Works on Kindle Fire HD7.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />Very nice graphics, sound effects, and for the most part, logical challenges<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br /><br />On some levels, the spiders don't move in logical directions.  Solution is a combination of guess/trial-and-error and logic.<br /><br />I'd give 4.5 stars, which rounds to 5.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|This is a very good movie but I don't think it was an academy award performance.  I would still recommend it as one to watch.  It is sad and funny at the same time.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|I love this band of Derek Trucks and wife Susan Tedeschi and band. Just as good as their first collaboration together on Revelator. One of the best contemporary guitarists, Derek Trucks has had his own band in addition to being guitarist for The Allman Brothers Band. Susan Tedeschi has had success in the past with her solo career and merging the two together with a band comprised of horns has added richness to the sound. The sound is blues based. Title track, Made Up Mind starts the album off with a beat that just makes you want to get up and dance. The second song, Do I Look Worried slows the beat down to a slow, bluesy tone and Tedeschi's voice just shines. Misunderstood has a funky, blues kind of beat.  Calling Out to You, the last song on the album, is a beautiful slow tune of loving trust in a relationship. These musicians are so talented that there just isn't a bad song on the album. I highly recommend it if you enjoy the blues and roots based kind of music. You will not be disappointed!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Great series!  Better than Magnum PI.  You must buy all in the collection and watch them in the correct order.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|Although I have seen the Game of Thrones TV series, this is still really exciting and enjoyable. I do recommend.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Much better than I had anticipated. I had read a blog discussing the director and how although Dredd didn't do that well in theaters, it had a cult following once it hit video.  Very entertaining.
0143124544|2.0|Warning! Spoilers!<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book and read it very quickly.<br /><br />The irony of Will instructing Lou to enjoy her life and take risks, is apparently lost on both himself and Lou.<br /><br />I considered him arrogant and superior in the way he related to Lou. He treated her as a child - go live, do this and that, travel EXCEPT for the fact that he had to keep his date with death. Unconvincing.<br /><br />Her was not better a partner than her ex. Both were self focused.<br /><br />He never really showed her that he loved her except with financially. Too easy.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Nothing new here. The same ol cast of washed up action actors. Except for location same basic story as Expendables.
