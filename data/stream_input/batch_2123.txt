B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Flight was very thought provoking. Seeing addiction take control of ones life because of not knowing how to deal with ones issues was done brillant by this movie.
078324228X|4.0|Denzel Washington is a great actor. He actually did justice to Rubin &#34;Hurricane&#34; Carter. It is a great movie. I recommend this to others.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Challenging. Loved the mystery theme!<br />I very much enjoy the variety of the puzzles. Opened it up to take a look for a few minutes and several hours later I am still playing.  I would highly recommend Mysteryville 2.
B000C20VPA|4.0|Was a good movie: action packed. Robert Deniro and Joe Pesci were great actors. I enjoyed it. For those who enjoy action films, I recommend.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very factual and very interesting.  It is well worth reading if you like World War II books.  Read it for a book club - most everyone really liked it.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Band Of Brothers, this movie is right on the same lines. In The Pacific you follow the experiences of a few different veterens, along with their different perspectives of the war. I bought this for my dad, he liked BOB better....but myself, I enjoyed The Pacific more...even though I was a die hard fan of &#34;Easy Co.&#34; in BOB. Great movie...you wont be disappointed.
0525953728|2.0|This is the first book I picked to read based on all the good reviews on Amazon, and I'm very disappointed.  I can't believe this book got so many good reviews.  As a first hand account of the mission, the author's perspective is naturally one-sided and narrow, and is in sharp contrast to Peter Bergen's Manhunt, which is balanced, well researched and enlightens the readers with the big picture. Mark Owen / Matt Bissonnette should stick to his day job, he is not a good writer.  But he certainly is capitalizing on being at the right place at the right time and got a lot of publicity, contrary to the quiet professionalism of the SEAL ethos.  No wonder the SEAL Foundation and others refused to accept proceeds from him from the sale of the book.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The Millennium trilogy lives up to all the hype. After reading the first book, the next two were done by the end of the week.

B004ZG5F28|4.0|This movie has a group of three talented actors, including Hugh Grant playing against type as a cad/villian. Renee Zellweger does a terrific job as Bridget, and Colin Firth does his usual brilliant work. Thoroughly enjoyable, and a sort of iconic romantic comedy. It,s the kind of movie that's entertaining enough for repeated viewings.
0812992784|1.0|I first heard about Mr. Rushdie's story on The Daily Show in an interview with John Stewart. The story sounded intriguing and with Mr. Rushdie being an award winning author I thought it would be a winner. Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br />Mr. Rushdie drones on and on about who he has dinner with, whose houses he stayed in, what he ate, drank etc.  Hidden amongst all these boring details is the real story about his fight for freedom of speech and what he and his family endured during the fatwa handed down by the Islamic religious leaders. There are glimpses of this story but they are sparse in this long tedious read.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|This is a useless novel about a game with rules that neither the characters in the book nor the reader understand. Moreover there are too many characters with too little character development - in fact the existence of many of the characters just seem pointless. And once the book ends you wonder why? Because it doesn't seem to be finished.<br /><br />With whimsical prose The Night Circus fools you into thinking it is going to be a good book, only to let you down. In the \\"thank you\\" note the author mentions that her book was a hot mess when she first wrote it. After all the editing and rewriting, I'm afraid it's not much better.<br /><br />If ever they make a movie of this it would be one of those exceptions where the movie version would be better than the book. It won't take much to outdo this nonsense.<br /><br />Save your money. Buy something else.
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This show made me laugh from the first episode! The episodes are short, but I still enjoyed it very much.
B00005JKDR|4.0|They said that the DVD was in like new condition and unfortunately it was not. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but I am sure I could have found it elsewhere for a better deal and better quality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game the best ever been seen ever. It's so much fun I can't stop playing it ever. You should get this game.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|The picture of the blu-ray is terable, it's not playable.<br />It destroyed my confidence for all blu-ray product.<br /><br />The DVD is good.
B001HN6940|5.0|I have always been a fan of Alice in Wonderland. From the original cartoon movie to the Alice: Madness video game series. This is a movie that comes into play many years into the future from the cartoon. So, if you are expecting a remake of the cartoon you are mistaken.
0765325950|5.0|This book was the greatest of the series. The final battle was awesome! I wiped tears from my eyes several times when old friends from many of the books were...I'm not telling if they were killed!
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I purchased this small mixer for the purposes of podcasting and it worked like a charm. Too bad the grown men I did the podcast with acted like 4 year olds because now this is just collecting dust. *sigh*
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I loved Matilda because she reads a lot,is smart,has magic and Matilda is a very small person who likes math.
0743270754|5.0|Our library non-fiction book discussion group enjoyed this book. It provoked lively discussion. The book may cause you to want to read more biographies of Lincoln. It confirmed for me that he and George Washington are tied for best president.<br /><br />Lincoln is so amusing, kind, wise and humble. I was amazed when someone said that one of his cabinet said he was a darn fool or words to that effect. Lincoln didn't take offense. He replied that the individual - I think it was Stanton - was a smart man, and if he said it, it must be true. The book provides insight into how Lincoln cultivated his character to be a great man. He worked at it consciously and continually.<br /><br />Although the book started out slowly for me detailing the different men's backgrounds, you needed that amount of detail to then appreciate how the different individuals worked together in Lincoln's administration. Once the backgrounds were covered, the book became riveting to me and is one of the best biographies I have ever read. If you have any fascination or curiosity regarding Lincoln, you should enjoy this book.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This was a moving and heart warming film. The acting was superb, and it brought the true hardship of the severely disabled to the forefront!<br />It was thought provoking, and in my opinion a must see film.<br />It makes you think long after....

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|I bought this for my son and he said that he was not impressed with it at all. He said it was okay, but he would not recommend it to anyone and they should rent it if they want to play it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun but not free.... i wish they would tell you that there is a fee and how much before we download....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like letting it read me to sleep at night and if I am driving or busy.  It also is easy to search for keywords.

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Enjoyed a few parts, but overall a weak film. The story was slow, and Bane was really hard to understand.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Probably the most useful application on my tablet. Easily worth 5 times the $2.99 price. From number calculations to date calcs, astronomy physics and more this app does it all. I just wish other companies would make apps as useful as this. Wolfram Alpha is a top notch winner in every way.
0307476464|4.0|I like Murakami's voice.<br />I like the patience and isolation of his characters.<br />I like the subtle life lessons he imparts.<br /><br />It will speak differently to everyone.<br />Some it won't speak to at all.<br /><br />So wait awhile before you form an opinion, let the story and the characters live inside of you then see how often you catch yourself thinking about it. Murakami has a way of getting under your skin and staying there.<br /><br />Two thoughts - #1 You'll never forget the name of green peas in Japanese, #2 I bet you check the moon once in awhile.<br /><br />I would like to point out that in Japan 1Q84 was broken up into several individual books - I think this would make a better read. I'd also like to say the clunky parts of this book might be a translation issue - comveying this sort of tone/idea across languages cannot be easy.<br />And finally, with more pondering I've come to think this book is a riddle within a riddle - to solve it you mut live your own unique life. Be aware when things change and then accept the flow of those changes while remaining unchanged even in the midst of changing.<br /><br />This is a book that should be read again and again. As you change so will its meaning and your understanding.
B0034G4ORM|5.0|A damn good flick.  I bought it for the action but it has a good subplot. Not to mention it looks real,  I like that.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This is a spectacular avenue to coming to know one's Self.  I was stuck by the simplicity and clarity of it.  Much to my surprise, my husband was as effected by it as I was.  We only wish it could be possible for everyone to be ready for the miracle and to read the book.  The transformation in our world would be amazing.  it is good to find the path for change in our own lives and it gives us hope for this divided country and world..
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Do not waste your money. You can NOT print using Google Cloud Print. Of course there is no one to call to voice my issue to get back my money. I REPEAT, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

1592407889|3.0|I have been a fan of Shirley MacLaine since I seen her in \\"The Apartment\\" with Jack Lemmon. And I always thought she was a beautiful special spirtual person. Now that I find out that her only child has written a book about her. I'm not so sure. There's no excuse for not giving an only child all the love possible. It dodsn't sound like Sasha had a 'privledged life even being bought-up by rich parents. And from what I've read about the book Sasha didn't get much incouragement from her rich famous mother. Telling her that she was a bit 'over the hill' in her thirties to continue trying to make it in Show Business\\". My God that's awful. Yeah maybe I'de better leave this one alone.  Bob \\"Ziggy\\" Anderson

B00ANGICRE|5.0|This is a very touching film. The subject matter will not suit all tastes but it has been most beautifully put together by a master cratsman. Ben lewin is an unusual Director in that his output is small but his quality is extraordinary. His Jewish background and humour and his own suffering as both a consequence of the Holocaust and his crippling polio enable him to put together works that are always touching and usually very funny. His Australian short \\"Plead guilty and get a bond\\" is a hoot for every second of its short 30 minites and it is a real shame it has yet to be officially released on video. His \\"Dunera Boys\\" is a masterpiece and one of the greatest treasures in my collection. Ben is the most modest of men but he has great determination and once he gets his teeth into a subject the result will always be worth the wait. I was lucky enough to see the first showing of this film in Melbourne and the audience was very moved by Ben's sensitive and touching handling of a potentially difficult subject. The casting and acting is just brilliant and the carefully paced story holds the audience right to the end. A wonderful film by a great master. Now can we bring The Dunera Boys to Blu!
B0049J0CTM|5.0|We like to have family movie night once a week and while sometimes there are duds, this was not one of them. It has humor for both adults and children of all ages and a heartwarming /interesting enough story to boot. If you haven't seen this before, or if it's been a long time and you're thinking about it again, give it a try!
B003Z4JQI0|4.0|Great sandle to wear all year round, but bubbles do get in and you have to take off the sandle to remove,no taping to remove. Great for hiking or in the water!

B0097NGUJG|5.0|This sounds more like a greatest hits album than a first.  I never really buy albums because I usually only end up liking a couple of songs on them but when I heard breezeblocks I promptly bought this one on a whim.  I was not dissapointed; every song on it is excellent and has deep emotional content.  Perfect, in my opinion.  If you like one of their songs you will probably love this album; I definitely do.

B006MW3V6U|4.0|Have very much enjoyed following the story, but some plots seem drawn out and overly repetative (Anna and Mr. Bates, for example seems to be overdone).
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I like science fiction, but I do not like the &#34;dumb down&#34; approach of network televison and I don't like commercials at all. With streaming TV I get to watch series that I would not normally watch. I have been intrigued by this series for a while and I now get to watch it on my terms. It is fast paced, challenging, fun and a pleasure to watch. The only problem I have at times is that good science fiction has several components, science, politics, sex and an explanation of the outcome. Sometimes this series leaves the last item out there dangling. I suppose that has to do with it being a TV series and it is not a real deal killer. I think the 3 main characters are very well cast and I think Dr. Bishop is a hoot.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a really good game, it's really fun, but there is only one problem. I can only play it once. When I close the game, and when I try to reload it a while later, it loads for a little while then closes. I can't even get to the menu. If you can think of a way too, please fix it.
8866130923|1.0|Too expensive for what it is, disappointed. First purchase from Amazon that I have been disappointed in. I have bought moleskin products before and liked them, but not this one. Not what I thought it would be.
B001GMH8TM|5.0|I have always liked this movie because of the story and the actors.  When I saw it was on Blu-ray I wanted to add it to my Blu-ray collection.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I think it was a great movie! Lots of action and suspense.  The best part was that it was free!!!!
B007I2BZIE|3.0|The last few Rush albums have only been for my Rush collection and not for anything else.  There are only couple of songs that I really like from Clockwork Angels which is more then I can say for their last effort.  I had to listen to this album several times to even understand what message they were trying to convey.  That being said, I have not read the book that goes with the music so I might not have full picture.
B000ZM7VVO|4.0|Late to the game, remember them back in the day. Just getting back to my celtic roots so I am biased. Personally like it much more than their newer stuff.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Still a great show. The networks made a big mistake when they cancelled this one. Would love to see another movie based on this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the graphics and pace. I also like that you can gather together with friends. Great touch response with kindle fire.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome game I cant stop playing you don't know how many time my teacher took my phone becuz I was playing in class but I always got it back some how
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A very gripping novel exploring the human spirit.  It was not cliched or maudlin as might be feared.  The characters were well developed and &#34;human&#34; in their actions.  I couldn't put it down.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Enjoyed reading it even more the second time!  Excellent Book.. History is always the most fascinating read. HIstory seems to repeat itself so often.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Bought for my daughter in college.  She loves it and says it keeps the upper classman, who have smaller guns, in their rooms.  She also said it has great distance and shoots farther than her rifle.
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|In these days of a dearth of Wagnerian tenors, Jonas Kaufmann stands out like a good deed in a naughty world. It is too easy to slip into superlatives when listening to him throw himself into six great Wagner tenor arias from six different operas without any apparent strain or damage to his magnificent instrument. If I am honest, I have two very minor reservations about what is otherwise a veritable feast of Heldentenor singing, devoid of bark, slide, whine, strain or glottal attack - just pharyngeally resonant, baritonally coloured vocalisation complete with ringing top notes and a poet's way with the text. They are these: first, Kaufmann is very closely miked and as such we are not really hearing anything like an opera-house acoustic, for all that we know he can fill those big, empty spaces. Secondly, Donald Runnicles' accompaniments are a tad careful and under-dramatised, emphasising beauty over imagination - sometimes even verging on the slack. I don't want to make too much of that when the playing is so good and the sound so grateful on the ear. I miss a little of the magic which a truly charismatic conductor can impart to the Woodbird music in the \\"Siegfried\\" excerpt but it's the combination of the tenor's power and subtlety which carries the day. Having said that, the orchestral postlude to the \\"Rienzi\\" aria is exquisitely played.<br /><br />Of course these chunks merely have the effect of wishing to hear him in more complete roles, and these are gradually appearing in various formats, if not as what is now the rara avis of a studio recording.<br /><br />Kaufmann remains the most striking and virile Wagner tenor of his voice-type since Ramon Vinay and Jon Vickers, whose timbre his so strongly resembles. We shall probably never hear another Melchior but to the majority of opera-lovers alive Kaufmann offers the best opportunity they will ever have of hearing Wagner sung superlatively. He shows no signs of acquiring vocal bad habits, having since curbed the glottal tic which was creeping into his Pinkerton back in 2008 and his artistry waxes with his experience. The slight hoarseness inherent in his tone lends it a distinctive character and an advantage in conveying desperation, which is why his Don Jos&eacute;, Don Carlos (elsewhere) and Tannh&auml;user here in this recital are so affecting; the latter's monologue generates a gripping intensity. Of course, his diction is exemplary, too, and his willingness to sing softly a blessing, especially as it enhances the impact of his full-throated notes.<br /><br />Of special interest is the original, two-stanza version of the \\"Lohengrin\\" narration and it forms the high point in an already definitive collection of Wagnerian highlights. Kaufmann is utterly credible as the heroic paradigm of chivalry.<br /><br />For many, the surprise here will be in the manner of his delivery of the Wesendonck Lieder. It is rare to hear these songs performed by any voice other than a mezzo-soprano or a dramatic soprano as designated by Wagner and Kaufmann certainly makes the case for their interpretation by a tenor of his calibre - even if I won't necessarily be reaching for his version before those by Janet Baker, Christa Ludwig or Eileen Farrell; the female voice lends a special erotic frisson to these languorous songs, even if Kaufmann can compete with them in terms of legato and even beauty of tone.tal tic which was creeping into his Pinkerton back in 2008 and his artistry waxes with his experience.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very insightful.  Having had some experience with Hemi-sync I was pleased to see it mentioned by Dr. Alexander in his book.  There are some powerful tools out there at our disposal with which we can explore our spirituality if only we open our minds and hearts to them.  Mountain Quest in West VA is a wonderful place to visit to learn more about Hemi-sync.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is the first movie I have attended in 49 years where the audience in the theater applauded at the end of the movie (the last was The Music Man at a big theater on State Street in Chicago).  The cast was outstanding, the soundtrack was magnificent, and most astonishing of all was the scenic design.  I was afraid the film would be too stagey and phony, or attempt too much realism.  But the balance is perfect.  This is one of the few films I've seen in recent years that I am sure will still have fans and be widely watched fifty years from now (just like The Music Man).  We enjoyed it so much we went back a second time.  The director is a genius.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|interesting and time consuming, perfect game for killing time. no real skill needed to enjoy this game. Great way to free your mind

B002ECEUL2|5.0|Found it interesting, the details of being in the Senate in Washington as well as conversations and his personal interpretations.  Also his conversations with others serving in Washington.  If you lean to the right, you won't even like this book before opening it.  If you appreciate open observations in Washington, you will find this interesting!

B0059XTV4Y|4.0|A Valentine present for romantics: A review of the movie W. E. directed and co-written by Madonna.<br /><br />Although panned by critics and burdened with dismal box-office receipts, Madonna's glossy ensemble drama of a young 1990's lonely New Yorker who juxtaposes her life with the famous American divorcee Wallis Warfield Simpson has several redeeming features.<br /><br />After all the films about a gal from Baltimore and a future King of England-and all the books about the love affair of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor-a new and fresh look! W. E. has at its center the Sotheby 1998 Windsor auction in NYC...from the Al Fayed collection.<br /><br />Wally Winthrop is not a typical housewife. A former employee of Sotheby's of New York, she has accepted a generous allowance from an abusive and philandering psychiatrist husband to stay at home. She is also obsessed by the ultimate love story of Edward VIII's abdication for a dark, beautiful, slight American beauty some six decades ago. On her almost daily visits to the Sotheby auction, she meets and falls in love with a Russian security guard. She also purchases a pair of the Duchess's white leather gloves for an astounding sum.<br /><br />The film is well cast....especially the two Wally's. Abbie Cornish as Wally Winthrop and Andrea Riseborough as the Duchess give amazing performances. The costumes and jewelry are spectacular and the title song &#34;Masterpiece&#34; is haunting. &#34;Masterpiece&#34; won a Golden Globe and was short-listed for the Academy Awards' Best Original Song. Costume design was critically acclaimed and nominated for an Oscar. Two of the Fox acting dynasty family played important roles. Laurence Fox is Bertie and his father James Fox portrays George V. Although I was not too pleased with James D'Arcy's role as the former king of England...it's really coincidental...or is it?...that my favorite Edward VIII is Edward Fox (the brother of James Fox) in the 1978 British mini-series [[ASIN:B0054DPLUC Edward & Mrs. Simpson]].<br /><br />The morals of this tale: Be careful for what you wish...history can be misleading in matters of the heart.<br /><br />Janeis tale: Be careful for what you wish...history can be misleading in matters of the heart.

0385523912|4.0|I wish every American would read this book.  I was shocked at how ignorant I was about the extreme deprivation and oppressive conditions under which the North Korean people live and die.  The true stories in this book certainly help one understand the power of brainwashing, and they bring new appreciation for the value of information and freedom of conscience, thought, belief and choice.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like the layout of the application, but I like my applkication posts hidden once I have viewed them. I give this a 3 rating as you cannot hide posts in your newsfeed. Add this and I may give it a 4 star.
0553473050|5.0|My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this novel.  Once again John Grisham has created a plot that holds your attention to the point you don't want it to end.

B00881VLCE|4.0|If you like jigsaw puzzles - you will love this game! I play it over and over again. Find myself doing four or five puzzles a night.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|This episode has all of the regular intrigue of the Bones show and is enjoyable for that reason alone. It is also a pilot for another Hart Hanson show “The Finder” Booth and Bones need to find a lost piece of a chart showing the ruin of a treasure ship. So Seeley Booth introduces Bones to a man, The Finder, that served with Booth in Iraq. If you like Bones you will like this episode. Plus it is a great introduction to the humor and drama of Walter Sherman and Leo Knox.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Kept me guessing to the end, which has a great twist.  I would recommend this book if you like the legal twist.
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|A great collection of favorites all in one place. And two versions of Hallelujah--what a plethora of delight. Reminds me of when kd sang that one at the opening of the Winter Olympics. What a wonder God has wrought, kd is the perfect vessel for this blessing. Love love love it..

B0094K1QR8|5.0|This is a cute movie, fun to watch, though some what morally incorrect.  I would not recommend it to children.  There is a lot of implied sex.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|THIS IS AWESOME!  THE ENTIRE FAMILY IS NOW HOOKED ON IT!!! We got it here for the kindle fire HE and then also bought the PC version!  Better than BEJEWELED, by far, in my opinion.
B00817V670|5.0|Great book.  Today's leaders could learn the art of compromise through these men.  Lincoln is portrayed as leader, husband, father and shrewd politician.  Please correct the Connecticut votes which were IN FAVOR of emancipation.
0811879542|5.0|I saw this book at a department store and leafed through it. It is so cute, simple and fun, it made me smile. When I found out my 6 year old cousin wanted it \\"the baddest\\" for his birthday it was an instabuy. I'm sure he and his 4 year old brother will just love it. It is also sturdy and I'm sure will hold up through many readings.
1439127700|5.0|The President's Club:  well-written, informative, full of history, humorous at times.  Good review of history with unkown facts and interactions among the presidents.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was a good follow-up to the Maze Runner. Full of action, suspense and really makes you think. Very good book
B003WJ81MA|4.0|Legend is a must see for anyone with a liking for fairytales. It transports you to new worlds with all kinds of creatures. It is a chance to see a young Tom Cruise, as well as another very interesting performance from Tim Curry behind makeup. Mia Sara is a joy to watch as Princess Lily, both the light and the &#34;dark' parts.This movie also has just the right dose of 1980's camp. The closest comparison that I can make of  this would probably be Neverending Story, with a dash of Peter Pan, and maybe a little Camelot. The movie may be a little scary for the youngest viewers, but anyone over 10 should be fine.
B009JBZH54|5.0|In my opinion, the Dark Knight Trilogy qualifies as the best superhero trilogy of all time.  While I am not a superhero aficionado by any stretch of the imagination, I can appreciate this series more than others because of the directors attention to detail in regards to making these movies very dramatic and intense while still staying true to the actual comic-book storyline (from what I hear anyways....I havent read the comics).<br /><br />The Blu-Rays arrived very quickly and we are very happy with our purchase :)
073937771X|5.0|Love the book…rec'd in good condition
B009DT424Y|1.0|Paired with my phone just fine, but the audio does not come through. Contacted customer support -- zero response from their tech support.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The begging is pretty slow and the way that Mary acts makes you want to slap her. But as the book go's on you see her transform into a good little child.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie had just what older people need when they take someone for granted and set in their ways.  Makes you think on how to do things better in the relationship with your spouse.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|really great app design and very easy to use. it's nice to have another device to rely on for an alarm if my real one ever decides to malfunction.
B002YCVX5S|3.0|This movie was interesting, but I did not like the severe violence and showing the visual of all the blood.  A clever producer can get the same affect without showing this aspect.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I would definitely give this book 5 stars. I loved this book it was so interesting with a strange twist to it. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to hear about law.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Well written not a slow spot to be found.  Rivals early Steven King in my opinion. Worth the read.<br /> The end
0553801473|5.0|George Martin's fifth edition to the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga is not so much a breath of fresh air as it is the familiar scent of your favourite bookstore. It's so easy to just fall back into his elaborate world even if you've been away from the series for a few years. His note on continuity before the first chapter is very helpful. His decision to split the story geographically and then bring it all back together half way through \\"ADWD\\" brings you closer to his complex characters rather than distract you from the plots. Speaking of which, his ability to give such vibrant life to realistic characters never ceases to amaze. Watching these people, who have become either close friends or fierce enemies over the years, continue to grow maybe not as we, the reader, always want but definitely in the way they should, never gets old. This is a strong and engaging story which will keep us reading and re-reading it while we wait for Martin's next masterpiece.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|an awesome series - would certainly recommend this for anyone interested in British life in the days of the Titanic.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|Liked the first 1 better. Not much of a story that I can remember. Too much blowing s*** up if that's what u like then ok but I expected more. Just a parade of older action stars.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good Read<br />This is a good read. More like earlier books which I enjoyed more than some of the later ones.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Loved every minute of this. Joss wrote and directed this is an awesome piece of work. Love the interaction between the group and the scrpt was well written and funny. Never a dull moment. Watched it over and over. My only complaint was in the view the stream froze several times wish was very frustrating but that had nothing to do with this film, can't wait for the next 1!
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is great to pass time and fun to play plus you can help your friends by sending gifts and giving tips.

B009X01C64|4.0|I received my Kindle Fire HD for Christmas and have been reviewing covers for it since. I decided on the leather Marware cover and I am very pleased. It is a simple cover that is long on looks. I have only had it a couple of days and have gotten several compliments on it. It feels good in my hands and the Kindle is very secure inside. It snaps into place and you know it is not going to get jostled out of elastic edges. The only drawback is that is does not have any place to put a stylus. That is the one and only reason I am not giving 5 stars. Otherwise, I am very happy with my purchase.
0062082353|4.0|While I agree with some here that the sections written by Chris' wife detracted from the overall flow of the book, the book as a whole is a great insight into the mind of a Navy SEAL and a sniper.  Chris Kyle was a great man, a true American hero and we are all lessened with his passing in such a senseless manner.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Great Action and suspense, keeps you in the movie from beginning to end. worth seeing and highly recommend. you wont be disapointed
0425188809|5.0|A touching and perfectly-paced story with a very memorable protagonist in Einstein, the golden retriever.  I never get tired of re-reading this book and I always get a little choked up at the end.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this to read to my grandson but I chose this book for me. It is very helpful remembering that life is about choices and not choosing won't get you anywhere.
B008Q09K2U|4.0|I like it very much. It´s quite exciting!!!! An amusing book as always De Mille and his character John Corey are marvelous I´ll have read all John Corey´s books.
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|I had never heard of Halestorm before I heard &#34;I Miss the Misery&#34; on the radio. The lead singer has an incredible range, from gravelly screaming to growling to clear, pure singing. The bad is tight, playing well together and doing most things right.<br /><br />Why four stars and not five? I'm kind of a prude. I don't mind cussing but sometimes it just happens so often in a song that I feel like &#34;I get it. You're angry and edgy. Let's move on.&#34;
B00B80ZG6O|5.0|Thee's nothing for a reviewer to do but heap praise on praise - Jonas Kaufmann is the biggest draw in every major opera house, and since his earliest days he has shown the potential for becoming one of the greats.  I'd only like to point out that he benefits from taping his new Wagner recital in the studio. Live performances caught on DVD tell us how fervently he throws himself into his roles. Here he can focus on detail and nuance. They are luxuries in Wagner singing because the mere basics are so difficult to master, and today's scarcity of heldentenors, which has been the status quo for a long time, impels lesser tenors to step into boots they cannot hope to fill.<br /><br />Melchior had a legendary voice, but his vocal acting was rudimentary. Kaufmann's sensitivity is fresh and unexpected. Suddenly Siegmund has humanity and tenderness, not simply a few gestures in that direction while blaring like a klaxon. Even the much disparaged character of Siegfried, looked upon as a brainless side of beef, draws our sympathy here in the Forest Murmurs scene.  Donald Runnicles keeps pace with thoughtful conducting, although he's  by no means a major Wagner interpreter. It doesn't matter here.  The orchestra is first-rate, and Decca's sound could hardly be better at balancing singer and orchestra.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer notes, the five Wessendonck Songs are meant for female voice, and I can't remember a tenor version, but Kaufmann has been appropriating Mahler's Kindertotenlieder in concert, a cycle sung by either a man or woman - the text is definitely spoken by a father, but again I've never heard a tenor perform this music.  Kaufmann's baritonal coloring makes him sound like a natural replacement for a low mezzo (the way that either sounds right in Das Lied von der Erde), but what counts is his musicality. As in the operatic selections, he makes a great deal out of the words and matches them with singing that shifts easily from the tender to the heroic.<br /><br />Does Kaufmann have anywhere to grow? He's already got the personal involvement and fervor that made Jon Vickers not just commanding but touchingly human.  Only Kaufmann can lead the way for himself. He's broken into unknown territory for Wagner from a contemporary tenor, and as much as I admire Ben Heppner, it's thrilling to watch Kaufmann climb to a higher peak.<br /><br />P.S. - To get the full impact that Kaufmann makes on stage in Wagner, see the YouTube video of the Met's new Parsifal. It is available, one act at a time, in excellent sound and visual quality.r />Does Kaufmann have anywhere to grow?

B00846REIS|3.0|This book was just okay for me.  I thought that it was trying to be a little too much like 50 Shades of Grey but was not nearly as compelling.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Loved playing this game. It was full of puzzles and evidence finding situations that had you playing for hours this game is very additive and fun.......... Waiting to purchase another game of this nature. If you like crime shows this a game for you.

B001NT057K|5.0|My daughter is auditioning for a local production of &#34;Grease&#34; (some lyrics and situations changed for age-appropriateness) so we purchased the MP3 version of this album to 'study' in the car on the commute to school. The songs sound exactly like they do in the film, with the original performers. Very pleased with the audio quality on the ipod. No complaints!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Works as expected. Use it on my my Kindle Fire HD and have experienced zero issues to date. The end
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This is a fantastic book for zombie lovers.  I do wish there was a bit more firm of a character arc (you don't really get to know any of the characters), but the structure of the book does add to the confusing chaos of a zombie invasion.  Fabulous!
B002JIBA8W|5.0|Great movie! The acting was superb! Even though it was a true story and the ending was not what I expected it taught some great life lessons!

B001AQMBNC|5.0|this is the ultimate sci-fi movie. it has a plot, humor, suspense and all you can ask for. the love interest adds to it which makes it a &#34;chick flick&#34; to a degree. Bridges received an Academy Award nomination which he truly deserved.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Very good book, I am not fond of reading anything other than sports and this book kept me reading from start to finish.

B000002KDI|5.0|This is the live album most representative of Neil Young. If you don't own any live album of Neil Young's, start here. Starts solo acoustic, ramps up to hard rock with Crazy Horse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is amazing. I love it. But it has glitches. But other than that it is awesome. Not many characters though.
B0038P59A0|5.0|This movie was very innovative.  I remember going to see it in theaters.  It was Guy Richie and Robert Downey Jr. The HD is breathtaking and the sound pounds just right through my home theater system.  This is the type of movie that makes me happy I bought a blu-ray player.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! I rated it a 5 star because this book is not just romance it is also an adventure book. This is my first time reading Hunger Games although I have seen the movie I know the movie and the book have little in common. I recommend this book and series to anybody, anywhere. I can tell you right now that I will definitely be reading this book and others like it again and again. I don't think I will ever get tired of reading the Hunger Games.
B0053FANS6|5.0|I have had a nostalgic type of love for these flicks since they came out. The CGI was good at the time and transfers well to the blu-ray format. The case had a crack along one edge, but I can't fault Amazon for something that was most likely the fault of the delivery service.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The site is amazing. I love all the tips on make-up, hair, clothes, ans nails. Especially on cakes and cupcakes.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I think its great that if I miss a show I can download it on Amazon. Elementary is great. It doesn't play down too the kids yet its ok for the kids to watch.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|Liked the data parts of the book.Liked the parts documenting the many positive aspects to being an introvert and the benefits introverts provide our societies. The Bad: Too many anecdotal stories where characters named have been changed. Parts of the book read more like women's/fashion/lifestyle magazine article than as a serious research book.Also,too many of the case studies are from privileged backgrounds.Has an over-indulged, clueless liberal, whiner vibe.Not much for the introvert from a blue collar or working class background whose introversion may have developed as a survival mechanism in hostile or abusive environments. I mean actual physical abuse not verbal \\"bullying\\". Not much for those who did not attend an elite college or who do not work at glamorous jobs. Even less about introverts who may fallen out of view all together.
B006LSZECO|3.0|sorry, but I did not enjoy the story. Maybe if I re-read it I'll like it.I know it is number #1.Guess I'm not impressed.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|On my kindle i cant get on my photos but when i downloaded this i could. This app helped my situation really well!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game. I play it every day. When I play it ,I try to beat my high score. And if I don't them I try, try,again. It's an awesome game or product for everyone......
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Haven't really had a chance to use this program yet so can't rate it until later after I have used it
B00846F1YW|4.0|Great game and it was the free app of the day!  It has good graphics and clarity and a zoom feature that cannot be beat.  Plus it includes other puzzles you have to figure out so there is no monotony of just searching for hidden objects.  So, if you're looking for a good hidden object game, this is definitely a top contender.  4-1/2 stars because nothing is perfect (although I haven't experienced any problems yet) but that's just me.

076790592X|5.0|Today's review is on Tuesdays With Morrie<br /><br />A wonderful and touching story, Tuesdays With Morrie is a true account of the last weeks of Morrie Schwartz's life. Once a strong and life-loving man, Morrie is struck down with ALS; also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.<br /><br />As a professor at Brandeis University in Newton Mass., Morrie has always tried to teach his students to not only think \\"out of the box\\", but to learn the simple values of life like love and friendships. And now that he is facing his own death, those lessons become all the more poignant for one of his favorite students, Mitch Albom.<br /><br />While in college, Mitch takes every class that Morrie teaches. And during that time, the two become more than just teacher and student, they become friends. And each Tuesday, they would meet for lunch and conversation. Their bond is so strong that upon Mitch's graduation, Morrie shed a few tears and asked that Mitch \\"keep in touch.\\"<br /><br />Not following through with his promise, Mitch spends the next sixteen years being one of the many rats in the rat race. He has the big income, he has the big house and fancy car, and he even has a beautiful and talented wife. But at what cost?<br /><br />One evening while at home, Mitch hears his old friends name on TV, and hence the road to his \\"life's thesis\\" begins. Each Tuesday Mitch visits with Morrie, and it is through these visits that Mitch really understands the final lessons Morrie is teaching him. Lessons that change Mitch's life exponentially.<br /><br />Tuesday's with Morrie is a fantastic lesson for us all. A lesson on life, friendship, love, compassion, forgiveness, and much much more. A lesson that humans world wide should learn. Perhaps if we did, the world wouldn't be in such a mess as it is. One can only hope.<br /><br />5 of 5 stars
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very different from other shows. Not an action oriented program, just good acting and a strong plot line that keeps you hooked
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Richard Thompson's latest album is another solid work from the master craftsman.  His body of music, the tree of Thompson, grows ever more impressive with time.  RT is deeply rooted in English and Celtic music, that is one of the secrets of his creative longevity.  Going back to Fairport Convention, his music has never been trendy or completely of its time.  It is a never-ending stream of variations on old themes, including love, compassion, jealousy, lust, stupidity, vanity, greed, exploitation, and violence, and draws on the rich vein of song forms as well.<br /><br />ELECTRIC, produced by Buddy Miller, is an excellent *album.*  That is one of the levels of Thompson's craft -- he is a master singer, songwriter, and guitarist, and he also knows how to construct an album, a craft that may be dying with the rise of MP3s but one that will continue to be valued by those of us who grew up in the glory days of Albums.  Every song does not have to be equally powerful on a well-constructed album, but every song has to contribute something to the overall mood and flow.  That is certainly the case with ELECTRIC.  While there is not a song here that I am inclined to play over and over like \\"I'll Never Give It Up\\" from [[ASIN:B000OQDS18 Sweet Warrior (2007)]] or \\"Haul Me Up,\\" \\"Demons In Her Dancing Shoes,\\" \\"Big Sun Falling In the River\\" and \\"Sidney Wells\\" from [[ASIN:B003NYVYB4 Dream Attic (2010)]], there is not a single song I am inclined to skip.<br /><br />ELECTRIC opens with the rough-and-ready Celtic stomp of \\"Stony Ground,\\" a cautionary tale about Old Man Morris whose lust lands him in the gutter \\"dripping with blood.\\"  The scenario is actually somewhat similar to the story in the video of Bob Dylan's song \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" from [[ASIN:B008LZHA3G Tempest (2012)]].  \\"Salford Sunday\\" is a very tuneful song of regret, though the scenario is not clear (\\"Sunday papers talking of indiscretion\\").  \\"Sally B\\" is a love song from a \\"working man\\" addressed to a politician who's \\"got the style touches the people\\" and who \\"talks so down-homey, like you know me.\\"  Substitute \\"Sarah P\\" and this song becomes a hilarious topical character sketch.  \\"Stuck On the Treadmill\\" is a catchy, toe-tapping Celtic rock number about the life of the assembly line worker.  \\"Me and the robot working away, he looks at me as if to say 'I'll be doing your job someday.'\\"<br /><br />\\"My Enemy\\" is one of the strongest songs on the album.  Siobhan Maher Kennedy's vocals on this song (she sings harmony vocals on five songs) sound amazingly like Kate Bush.  The chorus is \\"How I need My Enemy,\\" a powerful message about hate and compassion.  \\"Good Things Happen to Bad People\\" is perhaps the album's strongest contender for hit single if we still lived in a world where that was applicable.  It sounds to me like a Dwight Yoakam song produced by Pete Anderson, with a Bakersfield sound via Sixties retro rock.  In fact it sounds like it could be a Roy Orbison song.  It features a classic unreliable Thompson protagonist.  He is full of jealousy because his wife is smiling and happy and he suspects the worst.  But if she's not ordinarily happy and smiling what does that tell us?  \\"Where's Home?\\" features acoustic guitar strumming and fiddle, a slightly country feel, and a pleasant melody.<br /><br />\\"Another Small Thing In Her Favour\\" is one of the album's most powerful songs.  The lyric is brilliantly sad and Thompson's vocal is incredible.  \\"Straight And Narrow\\" is a Sixties retro rock up-tempo number with Farfisa organ that makes me think of a Baptist Nancy Sinatra and her boots.  \\"The Snow Goose,\\" with Allison Krause on harmony, features acoustic guitar and a glimpse into the anguished mind of a man who can't resolve to approach the woman who is the object of his desire.  \\"Saving the Good Stuff For You,\\" the most country sounding song here, at first glance seems to be a song of redemption for one of Thompson's rogues, but careful attention to the lyrics casts doubt on that optimistic reading by the end of the song...<br /><br />The bonus disc is definitely worth hearing, mainly for the songs previously available on obscure Thompson records.  Of the four from these Buddy Miller ELECTRIC sessions I am most impressed by \\"The Rival.\\"  The lyric trails off though, and while \\"Will You Dance, Charlie Boy?\\" and \\"The Tic-Tac Man\\" are musically engaging, it seems to me that all four are lyrically weaker than the songs included in the (proper? main?) album.  The stand-out tracks, though, are \\"Auldie Riggs/Auldie Riggs Dance\\" and \\"So Ben Mi Ch'a Bon Tempo.\\"  The first, the tale of a drunken sailor and serial killer, was recorded with the Idylwild Arts Academy Orchestra from California and was previously available on the album CABARET OF SOULS available only through Thompson's own record label and website.  The strings sound great, though it makes you wonder about the presumably young musicians and their parents given the lyric...  The last is from the album 1000 YEARS OF POPULAR MUSIC, and makes you want to get up and dance around the room.<br /><br />Thompson retains drummer Michael Jerome and bassist Taras Prodaniuk from the DREAM ATTIC band, but Stuart Duncan replaces Joel Zifkin on fiddle.  Dennis Crouch also plays bass, and Buddy Miller plays guitar.  Thompson is credited with guitar, vocals, accordion, keyboard, mandolin, and hurdy-gurdy, and of course he sounds fantastic on electric and acoustic guitar throughout.<br /><br />One thing I can't understand about the album is the title.  ELECTRIC is not more electric than the last two Thompson albums, SWEET WARRIOR and DREAM ATTIC.  The title actually seems more appropriate for DREAM ATTIC, which was recorded live on tour with the electric band.  It seems like a failure of creativity.  But nevermind, it's a solid new album from Richard Thompson, so check it out!<br /><br />(verified purchase from Decatur CD)imistic reading by the end of the song...<br /><br />The bonus disc is definitely worth hearing, mainly for the songs previously available on obscure Thompson records.  Of the four from these Buddy Miller ELECTRIC sessions I am most impressed by \\"The Rival.\\"  The lyric trails off though, and while \\"Will You Dance, Charlie Boy?\\" and \\"The Tic-Tac Man\\" are musically engaging, it seems to me that all four are lyrically weaker than the songs included in the (proper? main?) album.  The stand-out tracks, though, are \\"Auldie Riggs/Auldie Riggs Dance\\" and \\"So Ben Mi Ch'a Bon Tempo.\\"  The first, the tale of a drunken sailor and serial killer, was recorded with the Idylwild Arts Academy Orchestra from California and was previously available on the album CABARET OF SOULS available only through Thompson's own record label and website.  The strings sound great, though it makes you wonder about the presumably young musicians and their parents given the lyric...  The last is from the album 1000 YEARS OF POPULAR MUSIC, and makes you want to get up and dance around the room.<br /><br />Thompson retains drummer Michael Jerome and bassist Taras Prodaniuk from the DREAM ATTIC band, but Stuart Duncan replaces Joel Zifkin on fiddle.  Dennis Crouch also plays bass, and Buddy Miller plays guitar.  Thompson is credited with guitar, vocals, accordion, keyboard, mandolin, and hurdy-gurdy, and of course he sounds fantastic on electric and acoustic guitar throughout.<br /><br />One thing I can't understand about the album is the title.  ELECTRIC is not more electric than the last two Thompson albums, SWEET WARRIOR and DREAM ATTIC.  The title actually seems more appropriate for DREAM ATTIC, which was recorded live on tour with the electric band.  It seems like a failure of creativity.  But nevermind, it's a solid new album from Richard Thompson, so check it out!<br /><br />(verified purchase from Decatur CD)

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonder.  Reading about the cast and the story told me that I probably would not watch it.  To the contrary I haved really enjoyed Season 1 and 2 and have already bought Season 3.  It is very well done and catches you immediately.  Time flies when the dvd is on.  My wife and I have seen seasons one and two many times.  Much of TV is really a wasteland and D.A. is a rare gem.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|After a couple of eposoide, I felt that this show was worth watching. The actions, story, and mystery is well done.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|I bought it August 15th, it worked great for a while totaling 4 MONTHS.  I didn't listen to the other REVIEWS!  It completely started malfunctioning and messing up in the beginning of January.  I have and expensive speaker dock and it started only playing one side of the speaker.  ANYWAY, as soon as I take off the otter box and put the Iphone 4s on the dock alone it plays perfect.  THIS UNIT IS A CHEAP SCAM that will fail!!!!!!!  If it is worth $25-30 to have use for four months than buy it.  GARBAGE PRODUCT that does not offer any warranty.  Don't WASTE your Money!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great acting with good roles for all the players. We watched the whole season in two nights. It was like a good book that you couldn't put down.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|What else can I say, it's simply one of the best sci-fi shows ever made.  Killed off WAY too soon...
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I really loved this show it was hard to wait to see the next one.I hated to see it end.

0553593544|5.0|I first listened to this book  in 1980 as a \\"Book on Tape\\" - read by Michael Pritchard - arguably one of the best at his craft.  I am listening to the new cd version - and I can see why I thought this book was, and still is, one of the very best in its genre!  Scott Brick - who is reading this cd version - is absolutely outstanding.  The combination of Ludlum and Brick is unmatched!!!  I relish every moment of listening!!!

B008ODZNLG|5.0|Beautifully shot and edited.  So many lessons about perseverance and excellence.  Only criticism is white colored subtitles against light backgrounds at times making it difficult to read.

B007REV4YI|5.0|A debate rages within my household. Is Daniel Craig the best Bond ever?<br /><br />As a traditionalist I had argued that Sean Connery has no peer among the half dozen or so actors who have played 007 on the big screen. Skyfall has undercut my argument. Daniel Craig has emerged as a worthy pretender to the crown. Not only that Skyfall itself just may be the best movie in the franchise surpassing even [[ASIN:B008YKV1T2 Goldfinger (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]]].<br /><br />Skyfall opens with a chase through the streets and environs of Istanbul, first seen in [[ASIN:B008YKV1YM From Russia with Love (50th Anniversary Repackage) [Blu-ray]]]. In a thrilling chase across the top of a moving train, Bond is the victim of friendly fire and plunges headfirst off a railroad bridge into a raging river where his body is swept over a waterfall. Bond is dead. Of course not. Bond is simply enjoying being dead until the London headquarters of MI-6 explode right in front of M's eyes. Bond returns from the dead and after taking a return to duty fitness exam (which he obviously flunks) is sent back into the field and equipped with a new gun and a radio by the new Q, a computer nerd.<br /><br />What follows is vintage Bond. M and Bond chase the mastermind of the London bombing, a former MI6 agent Raoul Silva, fiendishly portrayed by Javier Bardem. Silva has acquired a list of undercover NATO agents around the world and those agents are being eliminated one by one.<br /><br />Ultimately the hunt leads back to London and then to Scotland for the final confrontation. In the Bond world, when its man against machine, the machines do a lot of damage but ultimately lose. Fortunately for Bond, he has a few machine's of his own including his classic ejector seat equipped Aston Martin DB5.<br /><br />Is Skyfall as good as Goldfinger? The production values are much higher, but then again it has been almost 50 years since Auric Goldfinger planned to nuke Fort Knox. The plots have as many holes and improbabilities as ever. But that what makes Bond movies so fun.<br /><br />So in an effort to bring peace to my household, I will say that Skyfall is the best Bond movie ever, but the mighty Scot Sean Connery is still, barely, the greatest Bond.

B009VMN3RA|5.0|This is not a \\"Mommy Dearest\\" affair, where the child suffers relentless emotional and physical abuse.  It is more a suffering of a so-close, yet so-far estrangement from a child and her parents; that festers a lack of personal confidence and security in the child's adult years.  Sachi Parker never hints of harboring lasting resentments against either of her parents, and in fact, many good memories of times she spent with Shirley are told.  The major obstacle appears to be the deliberate boundary Shirley constructed between everyone and her career ambition.  This was far beyond the concept of \\"working mother\\". Shirley McClaine was hell-bent on being a major success, and nothing, or no one, was going to be permitted to be an obstacle to that.  After reading this, Ms. McClaine is not likely to win your vote for the Parenting Oscar, (although all parents know it's not a walk in the park).  There are many secrets in the parent's relationship that the child yearns to learn and reconcile.<br /><br />(Parental guidance: not recommended for children under 16, as explicit adult behavior is periodically described.)<br /><br />Women, are likely to love this book more than men, because of its mother/daughter relationship-dynamic reasons.<br />Not every chapter here is captivating, however, there are some astounding stories told here.  I do honestly believe that Sachi is telling the truth, and Shirley's legacy will hereafter - forever be tarnished.  For Ms. McClaine, there appears to be little other option than to: \\"Shut up, and deal (with it)\\".
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A very good read, keeps you turning the pages - a wonderful story of love and loss, and finding oneself....
0802130208|2.0|It is not consider good form to laugh at deranged people. The main character is dreanged, and if you ever personally known someone like him, you would not like this novel.  On the other hand, I read it to the end. The really likeable and funny character is Jones. I hope the fact that he is black does not offend anyone. His character makes everyone else look insane. This is a well writen book, and since I listened on tape, the narration was excellent. There really is no plot in the book. Its a bunch of miserable characters living in disorder. If there is a plot, its Riley's descent into madness. And again, apologies to New Orleans, but where else is more likely to discover a cast of characters living on the edge of sanity.<br /><br />This is not a book to take to the Beach, or read after a friend or relative is hospitized for a mental disorder.  It will not help you understand the problem. The only benefit this novel has, is to remind us that there is a lot of troubled folk out there.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The trailer made this look really good.  Unfortunately there was not substance.  I am a big Liam Neeson fan.  He did a great job - the movie was not worth the time.
B000A1C68S|5.0|There are hundreds of reviews on this flick, one star to five who need more?.  Maybe a matter of taste but this is one of my favorite movies, but apparently not for everyone. Gave three of them for Christmas stocking stuffers to very mixed reaction.

B0054SMID0|4.0|The movie was good but it was predictable in most parts still it is a good movie to watch with your family
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|loved every moment of this film. the performances, especially by John Hawkes and Helen Hunt (and William H. Macy) were delicate and human.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A good read when you are in the mood for something hot.  Lets you look into a world some of us just don't venture into.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everyone else was getting this app and they really liked it, so I decided to give it a try. Boy am I glad I did!!!! This game has a lot of different levels where you try to fill up the board with pipe and connect the 2 dots that are the same colors. It gets harder as you go. Now when I am bored and waiting for something, I can just play this game and it won't divert my attention entirely, but it still keeps me occupied. I would rate this higher if I could, but I can't, so a five star rating it is.
B00AVTMCYW|4.0|I read the book by Steven Chbosky (if you haven't, you should too), and so I went into this movie with the usual apprehension that accompanies seeing a great book made into a (possibly mediocre) movie. Much to my surprise, they did a fabulous job. I loved Emma Watson as Sam.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Both my daughter, is a deputy sheriff, are hooked on these books.  Being in law enforcement, it's hard for her to find any form of media on the subject that keeps her interest but these do.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read. It is a testament to the courage and humanity of men who were thrown together in a moment of time only to be linked for eternity. Their time together in the skies was the basis for this book, but it was only a minor aspect. The backgrounds of both pilots flowed so well that when they finally meet, the reader understands each man perfectly. It is an oft quoted sentiment, but I honestly envy the person who picks this book up to read it for the first time.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|This was what I expected and more. Thankfully, Troublemaker studio let the director play this one straight. My only complaint has to do with the commentary between Robert Rodriguez and director Nimrod Antal. There was more mutual hand-jobbing going and little insight of the production process. Small detail - barely worth mentioning - just sayin....<br /><br />  Can I say 'hand-jobbing' on Amazon?
0679405496|3.0|I picked up E.M. Forster's classic work as just something to read while on a trip. Having not seen the movie nor knowing anything about the novel other than the recommendations of others, I was surprised and at the same time disappointed. While I enjoyed the details of period India and the basic plot of the book, it was a bit of a slow read for me. Some classics don't hold up well to modern times. Why I can't say. This is a great but somewhat dated book. I'm sure anyone interested in history and period  locals will find A Passage To India much more appealing.<br />BJ Neblett [[ASIN:1936587734 Elysian Dreams: Where the Past Meets the Present]]
B00422LESO|4.0|This book was written with the romantic in mind and what woman isn't a little in love with Colin Firth's \\"Mr. Darcy\\".  The book has surprising depth, although it seems to admit to itself - it is a little silly.  I enjoyed the story and the little surprises that come at the end.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|bought this as a birthday gift for a friend.  my daughter and i love the series so we thought she would too
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|I just love this CD.  It arrived 3 days ago and I can't take it out of my player.  Definitely Nashville influenced, but every song is so different, you can't classify it as country.  It is just full of wonderful songs and fantastic harmonies. The three just blend so well together and each brings their own influence to the project. Very well produced by Peter Asher.  Buy this CD today.  You won't be disappointed!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|did this app cost cause I clicked didn't read but good app I wish I had a back camera it would work better
B001MEJY8W|5.0|So, why the 5 stars?<br />I bought this on a recommendation with the warning that, while it was a good movie, it was hard to watch.<br />I was not lied to.<br /><br />This IS a well made film with a compelling story. It lost me on a couple of points but not enough to detract from the whole movie.<br />  The brutality is uncomprimising. I thought I was jaded to excesses in violent movies but I've met my match. Perhaps my tastes have matured, been elevated or I've softened - whatever.<br />I may not have &#34;liked&#34; the unfolding and building brutality, but that 'fault' lies with me, not what was finally produced by the film makers.<br />  That's it - I'm done. No more for me, thanks.
0446364495|3.0|I read bridges Of Madison County after seeing the movie. Perhaps that was my mistake. Sentimentality being one thing, love stories being another, I found the main character Robert Kincaid one dimensional. There is the foundation for a great book here, but Waller seems to run out of concrete about half way through leaving readers with just a nice love story.<br />BJ Neblett [...]

B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I'm a little conflicted about these books. The writing isn't spectacular, but I did enjoy the story, the world and its characters.<br /><br />My main complaint about this book and the next two books as well, is that the twists weren't twists at all to me. I don't usually mind if I figure something out through subtle foreshadowing or clues and I'm usually very empathetic toward characters. However, the degree to which things were foreshadowed combined with the angst certain aspects caused the characters frustrated me to no end. Things were made so obvious to me that it made me feel like the characters should see it as well. As result, elements of the story that should have made me feel empathetic toward the characters ended up making me frustrated with them. There were a lot of plot elements that should have been big moments for the characters and the reader but fell short because I'd seen it coming for so long. Maybe these books were just a shade too YA for me as someone in their mid-20s?<br /><br />I will say that my love of the world that the author created and the characters themselves overshadowed my frustration. They kept me reading. I also wanted to see exactly how everything would play out though there were no big surprises. I read the first three books in quick succession, but have not picked up any more as the story wraps up nicely after the third book. I didn't really feel a pull to pick up the next one right away. I will probably read the rest eventually though. Overall I enjoyed the books, but they're not at the top of my list to read.
B000W7JWUA|3.0|This game takes time to learn.  It's not for the impatient player. My family played it for a while but it now sits on the shelf awaiting some burst of inspiration.

0316228532|1.0|This book was all about the white trash in a small town in England.  Included drug use, rape, incest, adultery, etc.  I kept reading in hopes that things would get better but it was a complete disappointment.<br />I wondered why she would even write such a book.  Did she suffer a bad childhood?  Did she know people these things happened to?  I had hoped some of the characters would redeem themselves but it was a waste of time to read.  All around a depressing and sad book about sad situations.<br />I had expected more from the writer of \\"Harry Potter\\".<br />Again \\"why would she write such a book?\\"<br />I did read the reviews before reading it myself.<br />I am sorry to say it wasn't worth the time it took to read it.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|This very disappointing and totally improbable plot involves the usual Reacher triumph against the nasties.  Terrorists do exist and plot in North America, but clearly Child is losing it.  Perhaps it is time to rest Reacher for a while.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I could have done without 'miss Steele's' continuous \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" rants. Her thoughts are hers alone I don't think the reader needs constant narration of where each thought is being generated. Overall the book was a (dirty) treat and most of what I hoped for. Can't wait to start the next one.
B008CP6RWU|4.0|I bought this because I was looking for something that was not really a &#34;game&#34;. Based on previous reviews, my expectations were high indeed. After playing it though, I'll agree with other reviewers...&#34;Buy it on sale&#34;. It's not that it's bad, it just fills a different niche. Some players will love it and others will be bored quickly. My 10 yr old couldn't stop once he had started, but it was more like he was reading a book he really liked than the typical &#34;Lego Indiana Jones&#34; hyper-ness.<br /><br />I was playing &#34;007 Reloaded&#34; (bought it on sale) the other day and got extremely frustrated (not with my abilities but with the way the segment was coded). So, before I threw the controller across the room, my son who was in the next room and heard my verbalization, suggested I try Journey. So, I popped out the 007 disk and inserted Journey. Within minutes of playing &#34;Journey&#34;, I felt my self physically and more importantly mentally relax. When I couldn't quite figure something out, it wasn't frustrating because there is so much to explore and experience. There are visual hints, but there is no time limit so hurrying through won't help or hurt. One of the things I didn't discover until the second time through (there were areas I wanted to experience again), was that the &#34;companions&#34; that you'll find along your journey are other players online. You can see their screen names after the credits when you finish the journey. Some are very patient and helpful, and some will run right past you or pop into certain areas of the game. However, there is no real competition between you and the companion. It's more like they are there at the same place and time as you, experiencing the same stimulus. Sometimes there is an unseen bond, and sometimes not. Just like life. There are also &#34;portals&#34; that can take you to specific chapters of the journey in the blink of an eye. Hence, companions being with you during certain times, and not others.<br /><br />Having purchased it, I like it enough that it won't be traded or sold. I've journeyed through 4 times now and I still think there might be a few other areas with hidden discoveries that the child in me want to see.<br /><br />Overall, the whole experience reminds me of what Disney tries to give to it's park visitors. That is, a unique experience with lots of visual stimuli and a little bit of danger and excitement, all in a safe family friendly environment. The only thing that would make it better (and 5 stars from me) would be if you could have two players on the same console to experience the journey together.
0765325950|5.0|I mostly loved the Wheel of Time series.  Some of the books in the middle started getting a bit long, with nothing happening, but the most recent few have been amazing.  I loved the way this book ties up the series without seeming like it was railroaded towards the ending.

Overall I would recommend it to anyone considering writing an e-book (Kindle compatible).

B005LAIHZY|4.0|I just got the movie in today and it did not dissapoint. My main reason for getting this is because I have seen EVERY PIXAR movie there is to see, except this one. And now I can still say PIXAR movies are ALWAYS the legend of storytelling. At first I was skeptical cause its about a princess and a mother who gets turned into a bear by a magical spell. I just wasnt sure if it was for a audience that is DEFINETELY not a fan of princesses. But my mind was changed one day. I was walking through Walmart in crestview and was about to see if they had Brave. It was nowhere to be seen! I asked the assisstant of electronics and he told me that it was the most requested item in the USA. And after looking at Amazon reviews ( 5 STARS!! ) I figured I shoul see it. Its not the BEST PIXAR movies, but as with all the others, it truly is one of the greats.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|The acting and overall style of the film ,I feel, make the story come alive. In my opinion very true to the book.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I bought this controller knowing that it could have been risky. I have not had very good luck with the Sony controllers, 3 of 4 that I have bought broke, so I thought that I would try a third party controller. The reviews were semi-okay so I decided to try this one. It came in the mail and I was so excited that I took it right out of the box and tried it right out. It connected fine, but, while playing Call of Duty, I noticed that I could not move while I was shooting and that it did not rumble or vibrate at all. This was a huge disappointment. I will give Power A points for making the return so easy, though. Bottom line, DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER!!!I guess it's back to Sony controllers again...
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I am thinking that we all should look for a silver lining. Sometimes, it is not always possible. The funny thing is, though, we continually march on in that direction.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|its a fun game to play with my God daughter who is two years old except for the couple times it wouldn't open
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I loved the movie, and the soundtrack is just a good. Fat Amy/Patricia is really funny. You can tell when she is the one singing! If you loved the music in Pitch Perfect, you should totally get this!
0316001821|4.0|The book it good for those that like suspense.  The beginning is a bit too descriptive and is disturbing.  Would recommend for readers 18 years and old only.
B005KKU906|5.0|So funny so entertaining I love it it is the best movie ever in the entire hole world funny!!!!!!!!! Love it a classic
B005KCGIUY|5.0|A must for any Tool/APC fan. Not weird like the first album. I would also recommend the C is For... EP.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is awesome and I love the update. but it could use some more items. I know that the x box version has railroad tracks and suns.... it would be very awesome if this was in this version.... please add this stuff PLEEEEEEAAAASSSSSEEEE!!!!!  ME AND MY BROTHER NEED IT SOOOO BAD... electronics would be nice too<br />boats could be used a lot......
B006NPOB3I|5.0|I am a huge SW fan and had to have these movies to complete my collection. They arrived in a metter of days and in great condition. All discs played well and I have no complaints. I'd definately buy from this seller again.
B006UN3FTY|5.0|I tried to buy this book in a book store for my 4 year old grandson at Christmas.  They had a very large children's section.  I was told they do not carry classic children's books because they don&#34;t sell well.  I was very pleased when I went home and found it on Amazon.  My grandson loves the book and has had it read to him many times since Christmas.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|Got this as a gift for our nephew and he went bonkers!  A very cute story too for kids with adult humor mixed in.
B00846REIS|5.0|I just loved this series and am so bummed out that I have to wait til June for the next one.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|The plot kept me going, although it was a challenging read. It was a believable story about young love and the crazy way that teens think about life and death.
8866131059|5.0|I  buy one of these every year, I have 12 of them now. There is a lot of information included plus extra pages and compartments. I did not get one last year due to incorrect descriptions on Amazon, I ordered the one I wanted, they sent an incorrect one, sent it back with a detailed description of what was incorrect ( the size) and Amazon proceeded to send me the exact size I had just returned, so that did not go well. I gave up at that point and bought an inferior daily diary at a book store. This year I was able to purchase a real Moleskine from Amazon again, this time  I received the correct product.  Moleskines I have had are  quality products that I recommend and  intend to purchase again.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I'm a huge Buffy fan and love the episode Once More With Feeling. Sometimes I'll get a random urge to hear an song and this CD gives me my fix. It arrived early and in great condition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I don't know if you want me to rate the show itself, or the quality of the video when I watch it. The show is awesome! It's my favorite show on TV right now. That's why I'm paying $2.11 per episode. Which is ridiculous by the way. If it's quality you want rated then it's one star. The show stops and loads every 2 or 3 minutes. It never does that on Netflix or Hulu, just Amazon. It's extremely aggravating since I'm paying so much to watch the episode. Other than that, I really like Amazon.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this is a fun addictive game that has enough options to keep it interesting and challenging. One of my favorites.
B0094M2O7C|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the underworld movies. This one had a surprise and I look forward to the next one.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hate this book so much more than a story book. That is why I rated this book so low that is why It is  terrible..
0385736002|5.0|this book is simply amazing. I recommend it to anyone who's into fantasy such as harry potter. Im an adult and i still enjoyed this book of adventure. The story is amazing it hooked me from beginning to the end. I finished the book in 2 days cause i just couldn't help find out what happened in the next chapter.<br />Pick this book up, you wont be dissapointed. PS. can't wait to start reading book 2
B000M341RI|5.0|You know you can't wait for TV just to happen to show your favorites. Buy this now and enjoy it whenever
0762777931|5.0|A wealth of good, well-presented information in an interesting, and beautiful format.  It's a keeper!  Great photos and headlines.  Excellent reference to keep on hand.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very very very very very very best very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good and so wobder
B00846F1YW|3.0|It was fun to play while it lasted, but I feel as though it was too short. I would like to have played it longer to write a better review so I could actually get a hang of the game.
B008I43DYU|3.0|I use it for math homework. It's very helpful. But you don't get the  skins they say you will get when you upgrade from the free version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son who is 3.5 loves to play this on my kindle. I like it. It is fun and action packed movement.
B001V7UXG2|4.0|we are enjoying watching these together.  It's been years since we've read the books, but these DVDs are well done and Hugh Laurie is loveable, hapless character.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Easy to install and easy to use. Even my 4 year old loves to play this game. So do I.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|WHO WOULD THINK ABE LINCOLN COULD BE A VAMPIRE SLAYER, THIS MOVIE WAS A GOOD QUALITY PURCHASE AT A GOOD PRICE.
B0002O7Y8A|5.0|I have seen this movie at least 10 times and still enjoy it. Reminds me of the time when folks were humble and caring
B001W79MB8|5.0|This Animation is one great story packed into one amazing Art package that you will fall in love with. Each character is very well introduced, the plot is easy to understand and you don't get lost and confused about each event that happens. I give this a 9 out of 10 and so does Rotten Tomatoes
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|I own this move because of the action scenes and they obviously spent a bunch of money on the film. With that said, I also own 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow.<br /><br />The good : the technology is pretty cool. The Colin Ferrell does a good job. The story line was pretty thought out. Special effects were very good.<br /><br />The bad : at times the plot seems glued together weakly. I definitely think the lead actress was way over done. I am cool with tough action women like Cameron from Terminator SCC or Alice from Resident Evil. Those are some of my favorite characters, but the tough woman in this movie was a little much for me. Some examples : when the rest of the police force is in full body armor, she walks into fire with none, apparently &#34;badder&#34; than every single other person there. She has biceps the size of my thumb but can apparently deliver punishing blows or out mussel a guy with fair sized arms. Like I said, Summer Glau, Milla Jovovich, Chalize Theron are some of my favorite action stars, but this character was a little over done for me.<br /><br />The film also seems to drag on at times. I think it could have ended a little quicker than it did (or at least differently). The idea of a tunnel going through the middle of the earth and not being filled with lava makes no sense either.<br /><br />Final : I think if you are an action movie fan, you need to watch it. It is loaded with action and is a great visual movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a great app. Our 2 yr old loves watching it. He is learning how it works.it is easy to use and very detailed.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Good all around app to have. Easy to download and install. Comes in handy day after day. Quick to updat the weather.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was a great read.  It was a fascinating history and tribute to the woman who unknowingly advanced science in so many ways.  It's heartbreaking that neither she nor her family were ever consented or ever benefited from the importance of her cells.  Should be required reading for all those who will be pursuing a career in research to see the errors we have made and need to try to strive never to make again.
B002RXVOX0|5.0|this version is my favorite of all time...some liberties taken in the story line obviously but for me, it doesn't detract  : )
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD.  I bought it after seeing the movie and it played in my cd player for a month.  My daughter is a musical theater obsessive, so she took it from me as soon as she found it and she has played it consistently for a month.  This CD envokes emotion beyond any other I have ever heard.  LOVE LOVE LOVE
B00AB0AXU6|2.0|Well, being a huge Resident Evil fan, I was pretty disappointed with this one. I hope it doesn't kill the series. I am not exactly what they were trying to accomplish with it, other than to make another movie. The other movies in the series followed a sequence pretty close where this one goes way off track.<br /><br />Not really happy with the plot. If you haven't seen it, and you are a fan of the series, just be warned. You've read the other reviews; they are pretty spot on.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really like this game. I wanted it because my little bro got it and he finished it the second time and he did'nt use the hint guide at all. I admit I was a bit jealous.So I got it and with just a little help with the hint guide I finished it. It is a really fun and challenging game. Now I can play it without the hints at all! Buy this game. It is so worth 0.99! :)
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Nice game to have. app easy to download and install to your collection of games. My four year old loves to play the game.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|This was a beautifully written book, and it makes the point of how our lives are often intertwined with so many others in ways we don't know and never anticipate.  Great vacation read.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My daughter loved it and made friends in her first year of college by getting people to play it with her.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Before I started reading this book, I was wondering how could a book about a boy and a tiger trapped in a small boat in the middle of the ocean could be interesting. Sounds either like calvin and the hobb or some sort of religious cult literature. I am not a big fan of books that use so many metaphors that made me tear my hair out questioning my sanity. Anyhow, I started reading this book, and was immediately hooked. It is not just a book about a boy and a tiger, the story actually contains much more varieties of animals, sloth, chimpanzee, hyena, just to name a few. I won't call it a life-changing book, but it took me on a journey, and does change my perspective towards life. Definitely worth a read.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|This one's definitely one of my favorite albums of all time. As far as Drum and Bass goes, Pendulum's always been a bit more on the experimental side, but Immersion has an alternative vibe that's difficult to place.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a surprising season.  The last episode left me stunned.  The writing of this series is superb.<br />I will watch it again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very easy to install and use. Works great. A great way to pass some time away while waiting for someone.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel Washington is a brilliant actor. He is the only reason to see this movie.  I understand why he received an Oscar nomination for it.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|The story teller went to great lengths to give detailed descriptions of every place...land, sea, maze, individual rooms and even memories of places.  The detailed inner thoughts of every moment.  Lots of detail that could have been cut in half and tell the same story.  And it is a food story.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I didn't expect myself to like a book targeting at young teens, but I love this book, and the two others that follows. It is violent but at the same time thought provoking. It doesn't glorify violence. It is a highly entertaining read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I've already played this several times in just a few days and really enjoy it.  It's great while watching TV at night.  The ads before each game get a bit annoying.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I felt compelled to purchase this book.  Chris Kyle doesn't sugar-coat the information he gives and basically tells it like it is.  I really enjoyed the inserts from his wife, Taya.  That allows us, the American people, to try and imagine the horrors seen in war.  It also allows us to see how the family, especially for a mother of 2 raising them without a great deal of help from anyone.  This book is an absolutely MUST READ!  I bought this book to find out about Chris Kyle, hoping to get a more truthful report about Iraq.  I laughed, cried, and was angry in parts.  I want his family to know our family is praying for all of you.
0765325950|5.0|Everything I dreamed and more from the final Wheel of Time book.  A great ending.  I recommend it to anyone.
0345803493|1.0|Pathetic, not my idea of great literature. Again I must say pathetic will never read anything like this again in my lifetime.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I feel that there is no closure at the end of the movie.  The rest of the movie was pretty good, followed the same type of plot as all of the other Paranormal movies.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|Miracle on 34th St is a childhood classic and watching it on blu-ray makes it as good as ever. I'll be watching it with my grandchildren someday soon.
B0076DELIG|5.0|As a long-time Harry Bosch fan, I look forward to each new book with mixed emotions.  I have great anticipation tempered by a nagging doubt that Mr. Connelly will have to run out of gas, leaving new stories with stale and re-churned disappointment.  I am happy to say that I found just the opposite in the The Black Box.  The story and Harry Bosch's character are anything but stale and I was engaged from beginning to end.<br /><br />In the opinion of this veteran cop, Mr. Connelly captures the essence of police officers better than any writer out there today and I was left with the feeling that the Bosch series is far from exhausted.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|WELL MADE., STANDS UP CANREAD OR WATCH WITHOUT HAVING TO HOLD IT . . . . . . . ,
B00846F1YW|2.0|The check list covers up some of the hidden items you are trying to find....... P'd off I was enjoying game...
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I would recommend this movie to any fan of the Transformers series. Lot's of action and excitement. Would recommend to add to anyone's movie collection.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Mr. Landay's book definitely held my interest, and I found myself continuing to read, even when I didn't want to.  It asks the reader to consider what mankind is capable of, and to look unflinching at the regrettable answers.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift.  It is a great collectors item for all those Rocky fans!
B008ER9QLK|5.0|When I worked in a professional theatre in England we performed in a series of Euripides plays.  One critic gave us a terrible review and said the play was flawed in its story telling, immediately afterwards our artistic director wrote to the critic and pointed out that he was wrong.  The critic replied and admitted that he had looked up the wrong play in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  However, the damage was soon done.<br /><br />I can understand that a critic, who is asked to critique an operas or play, must get bored by seeing the same old stuff.  The present live recording of the Met's Ring Cycle surpasses the old genre and takes us to a new level of production.  Terfel contends that the set is too important, but for Wagner the set was just as important as the singing.<br /><br />La Page's Ring is truly magical, powerful and transcends present standards.  I am sure it is the way of the future.  Yes, there are failings for example in Siegfried the bird resting on his arm does not work, but so what, this Cycle has a few faults, yet it is the closest production we have come to what the composer wanted; The critics are wrong -this trilogy has set a new standard.<br /><br />On CD there has never been a version to surpass the 1960's recording on London conducted by Solti, but one has to remember that his recording was made in a recording studio and if  something went wrong it could be redone.  In my view the present Met's Ring is superb as a live HD performance.  One has to recognise that it is LIVE and in live productions you will hear stage noise, the singers may lack in some areas.  Terfel unfortunately does not have the majesty in his voice that is needed for Wotan, Voight may lack some of the high notes, but how can you not get caught up in Morris's raw energy as Siegfried, and wonder at sheer beauty of Jonas Kauffmann's voice.<br /><br /> One has to accept that as a live performance this is a remarkable achievement and it is by far the most outstanding production on video.  Forget the critics this production is pure electrical  magic.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I've read a lot of science fiction from well-known authors that I didn't enjoy as much as Howey's stories. He weaves his suspenseful plotting around a well-drawn and interesting world filled with interesting characters. I don't want to go into much detail for fear of spoilers, but I will probably find more of Howey's work soon. Recommended.
B00766CLPI|4.0|I cannot believe some of the negative reviews of this album. Give it a rest.<br /><br />It's obvious that Barbra is not trying to be Elisabeth Schwarzkopf or Joan Sutherland here. She is singing HER interpretation of these songs with her own instrument, which is a thing of great natural beauty. In fact, she is just doing what she's done her entire recording career; to sing straight from her heart. If you can't appreciate that then just skip it.<br /><br />That said, I do wish that she could have done more takes on a couple of the songs where her diction and some notes sound a bit muddy and strained. But overall I think this is a wonderful album that is a joy to listen to on a quiet evening.
B0061QD7YS|5.0|Great movie to watch with kids. I would recommend to see at least once in your life. Must have for Disney movie collectors
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|'The Hunger Games' is the first book of a trillogy. Followed by 'Catching Fire,'  and 'Mocking Jay.' This strikes me as a violent novel whose demographic is teenage girls. It has a  ///SPOILER love triangle between the main character and two guys SPOILER/// sort of the Twilight romance kind of thing.<br /><br />I read this like my last year in college and actually thoroughly enjoyed it. It is an easy read no lofty vocabulary. It has dysfunction and resolution, and a unique perspective that combines what a dystopia and post-apocalyptic world might be like.<br /><br />Guy or girl( you ) it's a fun read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|best Si Fi show around can't wait till the movies come out, I will miss it a lot. I am watching the show all over again there is so much I missed the first time around. It's fun counting all the times we see the observers.
B005N7CA3A|5.0|If you enjoyed the group Savage Garden or it's lead singer Darren Hayes than this cd is a must for any fan.Don't asked me what my favorite song is cause I liked them all. Lois Banks
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Have enjoyed all three seasons of Downton Abbey.  Had never watched Masterpiece Classics before but really enjoyed the characters and storyline in this series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much you'll love it too! :) and I hope you'll love it alot more than my brother thanks for reading this &lt;3
0345529057|3.0|Having been a HUGE fan of Robert Jordan...I was thrilled to begin George R R Martin's Fire and Ice series. THEN the HBO portrayal was WONDERFUL! I decided to re-read books one through three...and read four and five before the season started on HBO.  What a DISMAL decision! Having almost finished book 4...I honestly can't say that I care the SLIGHTEST about reading book 5! SPOILER ALERT! He KILLS everyone OFF...everyone that MATTERS, anyway.  The format of books 1 thru 3 is TOTALLY thrown out the window in 4.  The chapters are so disconnected, and the characters either completely new, renamed, or disconnected that it's a bit difficult to follow...only because I just DO NOT CARE about ANY of them any longer.  NO ONE is remotely a \\"good guy\\"..everyone has FAR too many elements of the \\"bad guy\\".  It's impossible to choose anyone to root for, since they're all horrid! NO mention of Dany and her dragons. HOW can you just ignore that entire story line? While you MUST suspend disbelief to even buy into fantasy..this is simply RIDICULOUS!! What happened to the \\"others\\"??  What happened to the \\"white walkers\\"..to the WALL, for that matter?? True, I haven't read the chapter titled \\"...meanwhile back on the wall...\\" ... but WHO CARES???  This is truly a HUGE disappointment not only for myself but for anyone else I've talked to who read all the  THOUSANDS of pages only to be utterly APPALLED with book 4!  Honestly..unless someone GIVES me book 5...? There is NO WAY ON EARTH I'll spend even the few bucks at a used  book store! I'd rather give the money away than waste it. I would LOVE to ask people...if you KNEW that by book 4, the majority of the characters would be either DEAD or left OUT of the book...would you have begun reading the series AT ALL?  I know I wouldn't! Martin did nothing but hook a HUGE audience...then write senseless TRIPE. SHAME on you!!  Yeah...I do find it odd that I'm actually MAD at the author...but there it is! You have RUINED the series...and that's a SHAME.  I don't even know if I'll bother with the HBO series...but HOPEFULLY they have writers who can FIX what Martin destroyed!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It would have been a better experience if instructions were &#34;easy to follow&#34;.  Not sure I will play on a regular basis.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I find Ellen DeGeneres charming on tv with her easy-breezy style and good-humoured badinage, so I wasn't expecting anything earth-shattering ... but this was a massive letdown.<br />  It's not an autobiography as I had, perhaps unfairly, expected. Instead it's a fairly banal, not-even-mildly-amusing stream-of-consciousness that feels like snippets of show monologue that didn't make the grade. Perhaps Ellen's charm only works in person/through the screen.<br />  The best I can do is say that this is a book for people who rarely read.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|only problem is i can't seem to get him off it!i felt the monthly price was alittle high. since i paid alot of money to buy the game,i didn't think it fair to charge even more each month
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I enjoy and look forward to getting new albums by Josh.  Josh has a great voice and we are very fortunate he shares his talent with all of us!
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Again, I don't know how she liked this as it was a gift. gift gift gift gift gift gift gift
0525953728|5.0|This book tells you things from a first person experience, I am enjoying this book, if you don't have it, I would consider getting it, it has a great story as well.
B000YBGU86|5.0|Her third album, her first to go to number one in the UK, making her the first solo female artist so to do.  Babooshka was the numer one single from this album.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|Pretty awesome series. Although some may not be satisfied with the end of Merlin, overall I believe the fifth series to be the best of them all.
B000SEI230|5.0|A wonderful story of loving kindness and faith and the mysterious way God answers our prayers. A very good book.
B008HK3XOU|3.0|all she wanted was to keep her kindle clean because it was given to her by her grand daughter in colorado
B004SBS8LA|5.0|really fun version.  I really would give this version a five . I have had it for a couple of weeks .
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is a great remake of the classic. I am a Star Trek fan and I thought this movie was great!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it. Very touching!!! Cried like a baby at the end!!!<br />Great read keeps you in suspense and well worth it!!!
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I love this band! I listen to this CD over and over again. I never get tired of listening to their music.
B003ZSISGM|5.0|I have the entire Trilogy and I find the way Stieg Larsson has drawn his characters is extraordinary. They leap to life off the pages almost from the start. The biggest challenge I had with these books, is that I could not put them down, and they interfered with me doing other work. Gripping from the beginning to the end. I would heartily recommend this book to anyone, and have done so.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie together.  the story is beautiful even that we saw a lot of Helen but kudos to her.  She was great in it.
1400069289|5.0|Loved reading it, learned so much and stayed interested the whole time. I gave it to my lacrosse coach too.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is a great film with far too many close calls. besides the unbelievable story line the action is great and the visual effects are stunning. If you want to destroy the world over and over again and feel a bit like Noah and the Ark, you will love this one!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Amazing book for kids I request it for every one Lyman Cracks a genious I would read it over and over again
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed the book! I felt the ending could have been longer; the author could have given the reader more information as whether the couple moved in together or possibly got engaged, married, etc.
B003Z0D4S2|5.0|See my review of The Girl who played with Fire -- this review is simply a ditto. If you haven't read it, do you.
B00A4YVHXQ|3.0|The little falling blocks are too small for a blindy like me to see but I thought it was a cute game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very awesome! I love the horse! My Chiro is getting better every time. I'm getting excited about getting a punk horse! Check me out sometime. It is almost like I was training a real horse!
B007SPPANM|5.0|Titanic is a classic hit. The movie ran fine with great resolution. Thanks! I would highly recommend this move to those Titanic enthusiasts.
B006LSZECO|4.0|First thought I was going to have to out it down, but glad I didn't.  Twists, turns and surprises abound.  Worth the wait.
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|I love the songs and it was very affordable. Will definetly buy more cds from this website. My daughter danced to certain kid friendly songs.
B003Z0D4SM|5.0|Fabulous books (the trilogy) I simply could not put them down. When I finished the last book, I was so disappointed that there were no more available.
B007TXN4TK|3.0|My vision is such that I cannot see the little falling blocks to indicate when to press the keys so unless I knew the song I couldn't anticipate the notes.
034580404X|5.0|The author of these books is unbelievable! I have never had a book hold my attention so completely from the first page! Beautiful, heartbreaking story that calls to our hearts and our minds.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This is a great film that will dazzle and harry Potter fan! It is well made and the resolution is great for a dvd.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is really beast. I play on temple run 2 almost every day. The good thing about it is that you can always unlock some thing
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome movie.  Brand new so no scratches.  Huge fan of all the characters.  Paid about five bucks less than I would have in the store.  Such a great movie.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I purchased the book because of the recent movie release about Jack Reacher, and  was curious. I really was not impressed, but I suspect it is because this is not the type of book I really enjoy. I found it a little too violent for my personal taste, and the book seemed slow at the start. For those who like this genre, I am sure they will have a different review. This is simply my taste in books that prompts this review. The one thing I must say is that Lee Child does know how to write.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig does another great job as Bond. I thought this was a really great movie and I'd recommend it to everyone that likes action movies.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I loved this book it took me a while to finish but it was still very good I'm glad I read it
B001UV4XIS|5.0|The ending of Harry Potter is epic! This is a great and well made film. The resolution and picture quality is great for a DVD.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I love this game so much I beat it twice.if you like this game you should get the regular style
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie.  Works great, not one scratch.  So happy I finally found it.  Nothing wrong with it, didn't take long to get here.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|An adorable tale about being able to do whatever you set your mind to, and about being true to yourself and those around you. The kids loved it, thought it was hilarious, and I loved that it reinforced some good morals.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Bought this for my son in law for Xmas.  He enjoys the show and watches it over and over again.  Received it promptly, in good condition.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I bougth it in order ti fix my lack of space, the marketing of this product lured me. But this just dont work, it mede my kinect crazy and contrary reduce the game area. Also it weigth to much for kinect and unconfigures it. I JUST TOSTED MY MONET TO THE TRASH CAN.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Lots of great modes like pandemic II but better.  Hard work if you don't want to pay for some of the features.
B0041VIJQG|5.0|Robert Plant has improved his resume' with a reunion with a group he belonged to before Zepplin, and the beautiful music is abound.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Awesome movie.  Not one scratch, could never find it in the store.  So glad I got it to go with my thriller/horror collection.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This writer impressed me largely because I have had some recent experiences which seemingly parallel those which he describes here. In particular his description of his passage thru various levelsl as he approached Heaven really struck home to me. I never met Jesus in my dreams either. His adventures with the little girl on butterfly wings were very amazing but not experienced by me. As he describes his adventures 'FLYING' and falling thru space. These I have also done in my dream state. His descriptions of these events and co-relation with what was happening at the same time with those observing from the 'HUMAN' perspective were extremely interesting...
B004K58GSO|5.0|Have ALWAYS loved this movie and it was so nice to have it on Instant Watch and be able to just watch it when I want to.
B001BZB6LK|5.0|in this classic which was oscar worthy, stewart makes a good attorney bringing his own style with it. this movie grabs your interest right away and keeps it.
B00BETLQLI|5.0|I love castle, it always gets better and better. Season 5<br />is great!  I hope there are many seasons to come.  If there were more than five star I would rate it higher.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is a very descriptive book. However romantic at the same time.<br />I was happy with my purchase. Thanks again
B002KGEORM|3.0|No complaints about this movie.  I would recommend this movie to others. It was not boring kind of slow and easy going.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I am a big fan of the show though it doesn't have a lot to do with the book The Colorado Kid. I watch regularly so going back to the beginning & catching all of the hints & remembering what happened in the past is great fun!
B008XBHIEY|4.0|This movie I had some trouble streaming it.  Stopped several times and ended up getting charged twice and had to contact Amazon for a refund.  Movie was good though.  Always loved Jaws.
0307932427|5.0|Want to know how we got started as a people? Why we are who we are and what factors played a role in deciding which cultures advanced quicker than others in certain parts of the world...oh and why? This book examines all that and more, it's a great read and would highly recommend it for those inquiring minds.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book has a bunch of technical details that maybe aren't for everyone.  However, this story would simply be nothing without the fine detail from this fine storyteller.  This is *science* fiction.<br /><br />My only hope is that there is more where this came from!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a unique game that I've found to be fun and almost addictive. I love drawing the pictures, finding hidden objects and solving puzzles. Highly recommended!
0307887448|5.0|Awesome, best book I've read in the last year. Can not wait for this authors next novel. Buy this book now, you won't regret it.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|It's convenient, easy to use and store away! I am very happy with this product and highly recommend it to everyone!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is soooo cute!!!  Have to buy it I think it's so good.  Another Disney job well done.  Nice to be able to just watch it instantly too.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and enjoyed all of the others.  I, personally, did not enjoy this one.  It's just my opinion, but I hope he hasn't lost it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book left me cracking up and almost to tears. I absolutely love this book!! I definitely recommend this book.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I definitely don't watch these movies for the plot or acting abilities - I watch for the awesome dancing, and this movie did not dissappoint! I'm also a huge fan of So You Think You Can Dance, so it was great to see Kathryn McCormick from season 6, and as always - Twitch.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|This movie, along with the original Elizabeth, are the reasons I am addicted to Cate Blanchett.  This was a replacement for the second Elizabeth: The Golden Age movie that I have worn out over the years.  AMAZING movie!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I vowed to myself a long time ago that . I would never read a Nicolas Sparks book. Then I saw the preview to this movie. It looks amazing!... but I still wasn't sold on the idea of cracking this one open. Then I spoke to my mother (who hates cheesy and predictable as much as I do), she said she just finished the book and loved it. So, my will cracked, I broke my vow, and I bought it. I'm a romantic in every sense of the word and I stayed away from Sparks because his movies and books Ted to be so depressing... and who wants to sit around crying all day?! Not me. This book was different, it spoke to every facet of me and gave me romance, thrill, excitement, and disgust. It played at every emotion I had. So, why the 4 star and not a 5? Well I can't explain that without ruining the book... there were just a few things I felt didn't add up and some things I felt Sparks should have attended to just a little bit more. Despite those issues, I'd suggest this book to almost anyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Really good book, I love this series! I Read the whole series and couldn't stop love  it love it yay
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I saw Zero Dark Thirty then read this book.  I didn't think the movie was written from this book but the account of the raid of Osama Bin Ladens compound was nearly identical.  What is interesting to me is that this book presents the story from the view of the Seal, as well as his background prior to the mission.  It was quite interesting to me.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Bought this for my new computer and it's great! Runs very well and the stock heatsink/fan installs easily. Just be careful when installing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very captivating series! Can't wait till the next season. You can really get lost in the characters and story lines!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Excellent series that we were introduced to this year and are trying to catch up. The problem is the streaming speed is terrible. We watched an hour long episode and it took 1 1/2 hours to watch it with many breaks. It is not my modem speed since I also use Net Flix and it works fine.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My son got the original perplexus as a gift and this is the natural follow up.<br />This is a great game for hand-eye coordination skill.<br />This is much harder to complete than the original one, so patience is needed.<br />The parts are not lining up 100% correctly make it a little harder for the ball to travel at a couple of points.<br />Be gentle with it to not break some of the parts in there. It seems fragile, not as sturdy as the original one.
0743496728|4.0|It took about a week and a half from ordering to getting the book in the mail. The book was listed in &#34;good&#34; condition and I'd say it is excellent condition. The book is a hard cover and it is missing the outside cover slip (with the picture). It would be nice if that came with or the description said it was missing. Overall, I am happy with my purchase. I just wish there was shipping/tracking info included also; I like to know where my package is.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I liked the way the author wove this story together.  It was very sad, but dealt was real issues, the main characters survive their ordeal and triumph in the end.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The writing is so simple and easy to understand but the ideas behind the words are so beautiful and make you think. You can breeze through it and finish it in a day or two. You won't regret reading it and chances are, you'll have a smile on your face by the end.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|I wanted this to be awesome, because I wanted to see my picture on my KF easily and be able to download them on my PC. Unfortunately, the app seems to hate my phone. Using a nexus 4, and it always says it is uploading, but it just sits there forever and never does.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|This book was well-written, but a little slow for me. I didn't identify with the narrator, which was probably why I didn't get into it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Great book. Easy reading. A story about the healing power of nature and the need we all have for healing.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|I love the ease in purchasing from my Kindle Fire on Amazon, particularly when I'm babysitting my grandchildren.<br />This was perfect  choice for quiet, engaging activity

B002MQYOFW|1.0|Not a good read, couldn't get into it. Didn't grab my attention where I wanted to keep reading. Bad choice
B0000042MY|5.0|I have long loved this soundtrack and listen to it so often that this is my third time purchasing it...just so i can have it in my car, kitchen and bedroom! Most moving and beautiful soundtrack EVER!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Title says it all. Pudding Monsters is not so easy you'll get bored or so hard you'll get fed up. Just enough of a challenge to be entertaining. The graphics and design have a silly, whimsical fell that will keep you smiling as puddings bounce off ice 8r you realize that's a snail shell stuck to the pudding.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I love the ease in purchasing from my Kindle Fire on Amazon, particularly when I'm babysitting my grandchildren.<br />This was perfect  choice for quiet, engaging activity
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The hunger games was very exciting! A must read book. Couldn't put it down. Couldn't wait to get home from work to read. Thought about it all the time.
B008NMT684|5.0|My 20 month old has mastered this game. He likes to pop the balloons or bubbles after completing the puzzles. He loved this series so much, we also purchased the airplane version.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I don't consider myself a huge movie buff, but I do remember my younger days reading comics and Thor was never a main character.  There is a reason why he wasn't and that was the lack of excitement.  This movie does draw lines to the Avenger's like any good comic they want you to buy more because of the tie ins.  Like most movies in the genre it is great to turn it on, turn off the brain, and relax with something that doesn't require too much thinking.  I probably won't watch it again, but I got my use from it.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Fits in a 2011 Toyota, 2010 Honda. Length is enough. If you have a outlet further away/lower then the reach my be too much. But otherwise works like a charm, charges fast.
0440243688|4.0|Lee Child books are much better than many and great if you want a faster read than Michael Connelly, John Harvey or Ian Rankin.

B004ETVAH0|5.0|This is an outstanding CD.  Some of the music is familiar, and the remakes are close to the originals in sound and style.  This is an enjoyable CD.
B00936A0RU|5.0|This is one of the best MoviesI have seen .It is based on a real story  and the impact of how this family dealt with the hardships of the 30's and what these 3 brothers did to make it and make it with the crimerals always breathing down their backs causing undo grief for the brothers at times.Watch and see what happens as these young men took control and finished this story with great entertainment. Thelma P
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is so intense and awesome. Claire Danes' character is one you love and hate but always cheer for - because you know she's right about everything. Keeps you on the edge of your seat, totally one to marathon in one sitting!
B003719G40|5.0|My daughter's friend recommended this book.  I've been married almost 30 years and now see how my husband shows me he loves me.  I am blessed!<br /><br />Every couple should read this book no matter what stage their relationship is in.
B00355L2TU|4.0|For first timers or if you haven't exercised in quite awhile, it is difficult.  You have to work your way up to the full 20 minutes, so don't get discouraged.  I like that the video features two additional women besides Jillian.  One you follow if you are a beginner and the second one if you have been exercising and want to step it up a notch.  I like it because I can do the workout in the comfort of my home, not having to run out to a gym.  The important piece is that I am getting exercise and the financial outlay is  minimal!
B005LAII8K|5.0|Unlike most cookie-cutter stuff you see these days, this movie has a very creative & original premise.  The cast is FANTASTIC, which should tell you something about the quality of the movie if these big names believed in it.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis make an excellent younger/older self pairing.  The little kid is scary good, especially for his age, and Emily Blunt is always a pleasure.<br /><br />If you can muster any &#34;suspension of disbelief&#34; at all, this movie is a sure bet.  Beware, that the movie is raw and violent, but any movie about assasins is bound to be.  I highly recommend this movie.<br /><br />BTW, they don't kill the victims in the future for fear of leaving evidence of death behind, a real concern according to the storyline.  It's cleaner to send them back...<br /><br />ENJOY!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Children from middle schools on up, and ALL ADULTS should view this documentary!  Your eating habits will never be the same again!  Extremely well done, interesting to watch, although much of it leaves one with a feeling of despair.  However, it also gave us the desire to improve our own state of nutrition, which is still possible with the choices we have in this country, as long as we remain alert and informed.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book should inspire all who read it. It should give every American love and appreciation of freedom and the men and women that give everything for that freedom. This is truly the most inspirational book I've read. Thank you so much, Marcus, for sharing the never quit spirit of yourself and your fallen comrades.
B00846F1YW|4.0|i like the different types of puzzles and the story. so far easy looking forward to the rest of the game
B000I5SY5U|5.0|Shows the contrast in Germany during the Nazi rise to power with violence, etc vs every day &#34;live you life&#34; pursuits oblivious to the new reality ... like now.
B009UWYFFK|4.0|This movie was a surprise hit in my house.  We all loved it and will gladly watch it again.  The movie is quite original and entertaining.  The &#34;scream cheese&#34; still cracks me up!<br /><br />As I've said before, look at the cast.  I should've known that it would be good, given who had signed on.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00936A0RU|5.0|Love this movie, and love Tom Hardy! It's rare that I like a movie enough to buy it on DVD. The price was affordable, shipped within timeline, and arrived brand new as expected
B004W4N55C|1.0|I have enjoyed your website as well as your app for my iPhone... But when I purchased the app for my android device....nothing! Crashes as soon as you try to sync your favorites and when you try to search for tabs... Please fix!
B009G78EE2|5.0|This is my first amazon review.  I had to review this album.  First off, I listen to everything and in terms of rap/hip hop, Im a big fan of 2pac, biggie, the roots, t.i., ludacris, 90s wutang, dre, eminem, outlast, game just to name a few.  Content wise, this is probably the most amazing lyrical and versatile album I've ever heard. Beat wise, it's in my top 15 for sure.  Some tracks will amuse you, some will emotionally touch you, and most if not all have an amazing and effortless flow.  I haven't heard an album like this since the 90s and though I like new guys like Kendrick, I'm frankly sick of hearing about how much p***y these guys get, how much money they have and how hard they are.  This album is none of that and macklamore puts his heart on a plate in this album.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING, and if you are questionable at least give it a few listens
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|I ADORE the DinerDash series of games.  I've purchased and install them on every device I own. They provide a fun escape, teach memory skills, coordination and concentration, just for starters.<br /><br />My only complaint, and to me it is HUGE, is I am continuously being force-prompted to buy ALL versions of the series AFTER I HAVE THEM INSTALLED by not putting an \\"X\\" on the ads to close them!!  I cannot find a way to stop it and it is becoming more than a serious irritation now.  It cost you two stars off the review.<br /><br />If ANYONE knows of a \\"fix\\" for this, please help me.  It's starting to interfere with any enjoyment I get from the games.  Just comment to this review.<br /><br />PLAYFIRST, please stop the non-closing \\"in-game\\" adds.  Or I will Play-no-more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really really good book I couldn't stop reading I recommend it if ur looking for something to read. It's just a great book
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You won't be able to put it down! Nicholas Sparks never disappoints me! Definitely a book to read if your in the mood for a cute love story.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Life of Pi tells a story about an Indian boy named Pi crossing the Pacific Ocean in 227 days on a lifeboat together with a tiger. The book can be divided into two parts. First, the childhood of Pi is described with focus on him exploring three religions: Hinduism, Christianity and Islam. Afterwards follows a detailed description of his long trip across the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />The story is written in retrospect. The frame is an interview of the author with Pi, who tells him his adventure. The book can be understood on multiple levels. On top of it all, it is a great adventure story in an exciting setting. Half of the book is devoted to religion, which is a central theme of the story. The focus lies on human trust in God. Additionally, the story includes a lot of interesting details on zoology, which is woven within the plot.<br /><br />The first part describes how Pi explores religion and develops his relationship to God. It is probably the one part of the book, which for some readers might be difficult to follow or even boring. The connection of a person to God may be dubious or strange topic for some readers, who do not belief in God. However, the second part of the book, telling the journey of Pi across the Pacific Ocean, is an exciting adventure story. It contains the survival of a boy struggling from dehydration, starvation and being eaten by a tiger. Although, the story seems to be unbelievable or even unrealistic at first, the detailed documentary of this adventure actually makes you believe it. It makes you suffer and feel how to fight for life against all odds. At the end of the story, truth plays an important role and really makes you think, what to believe. In summary: The story starts slow, suddenly sends you on an enthralling adventure and eventually keeps your mind busy thinking of if, how and what to believe of the story.<br /><br />In my personal opinion, it is a great book with a unique reading experience. After the first part when the adventure of Pi starts, it becomes an extremely intoxicating story. It really makes you feel as if you were there, on that life boat and living through the daily fight for life.<br /><br />\\"[...] I discovered at that moment, that I have a fierce will to live. [...] We fight no matter the cost of battle, the losses we take, the improbability of success. We fight to the very end. [...]\\" (Yann Martel, Life of Pi, p. 141)<br /><br />Tags: sad, serious, violent, demanding, unusual, success against the odds

B00A31UXLW|2.0|Michael Connelly is obviously looking to expand his horizons and perhaps earn a few  quid writing novellas but I found this offering most unsatisfying.  More work required Michael.
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|This show is one of the best on television. It provides a very unique setting that is lacking in other shows. What is so amazing about it though, is its level of authenticity. That, combined with the amazing cast and engaging writing. I really loved it. I thought the second season was even better than the first. Best of all was the (SPOILER ALERT!! STOP NOW if you dont want it given away) ending. I can't speak for everyone, but as much as it should have been expected, I failed to expect it. There is usually this veil of protection put around major characters, and you come to realize that it just isnt the case here.<br />Of course, it made season three all the better, not knowing how far they were willing to take it.
B0054YIQLW|5.0|This is the best presentation of Carmen as a movie. The pastel color rendition of the film adds to the quality of the opera
B009O2XY12|5.0|I have to purchase this game I am addicted to this game can play it for hours. I be in a zone.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|It doesn't have instructions.  It moves too slow.  Perhaps if it DID have instructions, I could figure out how to enjoy it.
B00417HV14|5.0|When you buy a concert DVD, you really want to see the musicians, and this one delivers!  Great shots of Joe playing, nice views of the interplay between him and Clapton, and just an excellent DVD overall.  It is so awesome to see his dream of playing at this venue come true, and have his primary influence show up and play with him is just icing on the cake.  If you are a Bonamassa fan, you have to get this.  If you are a fan of great guitarists, you have to get this!
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|The action, the actors and the story were great. The humor was appropriate ane entertaining. I reccommend it for a laugh.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|Love the series and was absolutely thrilled the be able to get it all for so low a price. I almost gave a five, but then a remembered the case was a little beat up. Now I don't really care about that. I know some people do though. So I decided to mention it. I have no complaints though.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome app you get to take care of a horse some of the things include mucking out stalls or buying more horses you can even buy a unicorn.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|First I should admit that I saw them twice on this tour, so perhaps I am a tad biased..  However, the show is really well depicted here in its entirety, including the videos to open the sets.  These were somewhat silly but part of the show so its cool that you get to see them, especially if you were there - brings back memories of a great concert.  Rush are a band that a lot of people overlook yet are some seriously talented players.  If you are a Rush fan, or just a fan of great rock and roll, get this DVD.<br />Highly recommend.
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|It's an okay start for tablet version of Photoshop. I was really hoping for a straight up brush tool. If you like painting with photoshop, this isn't for you.
B001KT6JPA|3.0|For anyone who appreciated &#34;Silence of the Lambs,&#34; or was lucky enough to see the original rendition of Red Dragon, &#34;Manhunter,&#34; this conclusion may be a disappointment.  The acting is excellent, but in spite of the changes to the storyline of Thomas Harris' novel, the plot seems contrived and the overall tone cynical and depressing.  People who are mesmerized by gore and horrible slayings may, however, find this movie satisfying.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Takes a while to load up all of the info sometimes, but provides a nice format and all the information you're looking for once it does load.
B000ICZCZS|4.0|This is an entertaining little film about a wealthy man...who has everything ( material ) that he wants....and a young boy who lives an unmaterialistic life...but has the love and attention of a warm and caring mother and no father.  Put a group of lonely people together and they grow into a very warm, attentive relationship!  There are lots of smiles, subtle at times, and laughable elements as well!
B005RDF2NA|4.0|This video is LOTS of fun for adults to view with children aged 5 or older.  As always, a few bathroom jokes that do not add anything to the film and can get a child in trouble at school if repeated.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|While this is an absolute favorite series of mine with excellent casting and now award-winning acting, what were you thinking when you killed off 2 main characters in one season?!  Overall, this has been so thoroughly enjoyable in the past seasons, I was so bitterly disappointed that you couldn't have come up with a better ending -- it was the Christmas special after all...  I can only hope that the main writer gets his head together to write a better 4th season.
0307939367|4.0|In the past I've tended to pass on short story collections but I've been trying to step out of my comfort zone a bit.  This collection was a good choice for me.<br /><br />Dear Life: Stories, by Alice Munro is a collection of 14 stories, most of them are set in the 1940s-1950s and take place in rural areas of Canada - probably somewhere near Ontario.  Most of the stories had characters that are easy to feel for -- often flawed or with lives in turmoil. The characters and settings are what appealed to me the most.  The stories seem very plausible and in many cases the readers, once they finish a particular story, will be left to form their own conclusions.<br /><br />Some of stories in this collection that resonated with me the most were: In Sight of the Lake, story about a woman who seeks out a doctor to help her with her memory loss. Also, Pride, a story about a wealthy girl and a disabled boy who grew up in the same town and as adults have a somewhat awkward friendship. I also really enjoyed Amundsen, about a young woman who travels to a remote area to teach in a sanitarium for individuals who have contracted TB.  Sadly, she lets herself be seduced by the doctor in charge and begins a no-win relationship.<br /><br />The final (4) stories Munro wrote are called, The \\"Finale\\" are autobiographical in nature. Munro is 81 and it seems clear that through this collection she is looking back at her \\"Dear Life\\", and those I found bittersweet.  Although most of the stories are a little sad, I did not find them depressing. Most involve a significant event that changes the lives of one or more of the people involved.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this short story collection. The audio book  (Random House Audio) was read by Kimberly Farr and Arthur Morey who did a very good job.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|\\"We are infinite\\".<br /><br />What an amazing story! I wasn't prepared for something so deep, I mostly bought it because I love Emma Watson and will buy any one of her movies, and also because I've heard such great things about the movie. But I wasn't prepared to tear up & have my heart strings tugged at. Buy this movie, it is a must have for anyone's movie collection.
B005LAII80|5.0|This film suffered at the box office due to poor marketing and public relations efforts to promote it. Word of mouth and a multitude of positive reviews of the blu-ray may have saved the day.<br /><br />If you are iffy on 3D, this is a good way to acquire a 3DBD at a 2D price. It does play in 2D on 2D equipment. If you have 3D equipment, you can play it in either 2D or 3D.<br /><br />A bad batch of disks was pinpointed primarily to Best Buy stores. Here is a comment from them: \\"I have received a final update from our business team as well as the vendor, and I wanted to make sure to pass this on to all of you.<br /><br />After all of their research, they have been able to isolate this problem to a specific number of copies of this movie. Due to the number of affected discs, customers are being asked to contact Lionsgate directly with any issues. They can be reached at 1-877-230-2756 or by emailing lionsgateshop@orderassistance.com.\\"<br /><br />I purchased mine from Amazon and it plays just fine on my PS3 slim and Sony BDP S570. Some have mentioned a grainy overlay in some scenes. I haven't experienced that. It is pristine in both 2D and 3D on my equipment.<br /><br />The highlights of this release are the slo-mo scenes filmed at 3000 fps on Red Cameras; (They are absolutely spectacular in 3D)and the DTS HD MA 7.1 neo-x audio. It will sound just fine on a 5.1, 7.1 or an 11.1 surround system. There is a sound test in the extras that uses excerpts from the audio track to demonstrate the height and wide effects matrixed into the audio. On my 7.1 system, when the height and wide speakers are demonstrated (which I don't have)the audio is directed to the front and center speakers to excellent effect. As far as I know, the only other Blu-ray released with Neo-x is Expendables 2.<br /><br />If you like live action movies based on comics, you will enjoy this. Amazing job by Urban as Dredd, who has to act with 3/4 of his face covered by a helmet for the entire movie. (Dredd never ever takes his helmet off in the comics) Very authentic and worlds better than the Stallone Dredd film.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|Excellent story.  As entertaining as TS 1 & 2.  As in the others, there are life lessons presented in a humorous and heartwarming way.
B004132HZS|5.0|Excellent casting, acting and intriguing storylines for the modernization of Sir Arthur's classics.  Thorough enjoyable, only problem is that once you get started watching, a whole weekend will go by so you can finish the season.  We watched it a 2nd time and enjoyed as much while waiting for Season 3 to come out hopefully later this year, since Dr. Watson had to film the Hobbit in the meanwhile --sigh--  But, thanks BBC for a great show!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this! Kept me guessing right to the end, loved the characters and the storyline, glad they had their happy ending!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised. This book was really great. I have never heard of this author but took a chance and am happy that I did. The story was very believable and I fell in love with the characters. This book I read in two days and was sad when I finished because I still wanted more. Would definitely recommend this book.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great movies on blu-ray with extra added features and a crisp viewing experience. I bought 3 of these to share or give as gifts.
B003L77GRY|5.0|I love Dexter.  This was a good season.  It arrived promptly in the mail in good condition and was very enjoyable.
1457514508|5.0|I loved this book from the very beginning.  Coming from a small town myself I totally got the \\"small community mentality\\" and could identify with the quirky residents that lived there.  I wondered how Duncan Whitehead, a man, could have known with such accuracy, how women thought and acted...sweet to the face, backstabbing once the back was exposed!  And oh the gossip and getting into everyone's business that went on.  He was spot on!  I found myself laugh right out loud as I followed the plot twists and turns, as well as the wonderful character development.<br /><br />It is a fun, entertaining and lighthearted read.  All the prime characters have a reason to have chosen to live in this upscale Savannah neighborhood of Gordonston.  Mystery, intrigue and even murder are all encapsulated in the story to make you want to read on to the very last page to see \\"who done it\\" and why.<br /><br />It was storytelling at its best and Duncan brilliantly left the best for last - the very last paragraph was when all your questions that were building up through the read was exposed.  I squealed, closed my jaw and said to myself, \\"I never would have guessed!\\"  This is the perfect reason why you should never ever read the last page of a book first.  I can't wait until some film maker discovers this little gem and I can view it on the big screen.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|One of the best series I've read lately. Loved these characters and can't wait for the third instalment. Loved fifty shades of gray but this one is better.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|So this game is insanely fun and equally easy to play. Roll dice, set aside brains, don't get shot gun blasts, rinse repeat.<br /><br />I was even able to teach my 4 yr old son how to play. He LOVES zombies so having him roll and count brains and shot gun blasts was fun. He had to keep track of his blasts too and every time he rolled he pretended he was a zombie. Of course we did too...so it was a lot of fun all around.<br /><br />Great for family game time or a quick game while waiting to play more games, or for dinner...or whatever.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This movie has been a favorite from the start.  Looks great in 3d.  Would recommend to everyone. You don't have to be a kid to like it.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|This was a very surprising find for me. Normally I dont enjoy true or near to truth stories but this was written so well. Love the sexual undertone through the book similar to the dirty talk in fifty shades, but with an amazing sense of humour. The insight to the wall street world was an eye opener and I appreciated the honesty in the writer. It was perfectly long enough and the summary at the end of what happens next is great and keeps me wanting another book.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|The game was simply great! Worth the money. If you are thinking about getting it, get it. If you ever get stuck then you can use the hint button and it recharges pretty fast.
B008JFLWLE|3.0|the app is cool but It would be better if you can do algebra and draw graph. it would also be cool if it would be User friendly cause its hard to do it what you want
B00846F1YW|4.0|I just started playing this game.  I haven't played Mysteryville before but I do enjoy hidden object games.  So far, I have been very impressed by the many rooms and the graphics are crisp.  I enjoy the mystery theme connecting the different levels.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved it! The best out of the 3, I'm sad to say that it is over though. I recommend this book!
B0091ICDHU|4.0|Loved this book and its characters. A little like twilights connection of two lovers. I was grabbed. Disappointed with the ending, too rushed and the I didnt like the thought of another book. Just think that this was enough however I will read it and it may surprise.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I haven't played this in years.  You can play with one deck, two, three or four decks.  I actually started one night at about 10pm and wound up playing until 4:00 am.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|easy to download and so far so good.  I like the fire wall option and all the info the program provides.  A nice software program.
B000068CNX|5.0|Best Series eva made. Love it soooo much i went to WB studios in Burbank USA to visit the set. Got to sit on the Couch at Central Perk. Went to NY and visited the building they give the impression they live in, in Greenwich Village. There is a restarant on the ground floor but its called the OWL. Got heaps of photos that i will treasure for ever.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book hit home for me in many ways. Zipped right through it but was sad when it was over. Love books  like that. Great writing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The story line is similar to many a story of hiding ones identity etc however this was written so well. Kept me sucked in the entire time reading it in 1 day.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I like my kindle, but when I got my tablet I downloaded this for it so I could read on that instead.  I LOVE this because on the tablet its all in COLOR!!!!  :)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This poduct is awesome I play it everyday. The graphics are better and it is the same yet different than the first.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I have really appreciated Korn's work in producing a quality product. The sound is great, lyrics are compelling and have spent a lot of time listening to this CD. Thanks Korn.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Another great movie from Denzel.  Shows that he can play the good guy, bad guy, or somebody in between as he does in this movie.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Never disappointed in the fifty shades series. It held me like any. Read it in 2 days. Awesome life wont be the same after you read it.
B003E8P9G0|4.0|This is a fast paced thriller with action and adventure at every turn if you have not read this book, read it now.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I had been looking for a cover for my new kindle and some of the other stores have other covers for more money. This cover is worth the money.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I would definitely recommend this dvd. If you watch the series you will not be disappointed at all. So happy as always when ordering on amazon!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absoulty love this series. Litterally watched all of season 3 thats available within two days. Dont like how it skips around from group to group but i can deal. I highly reccomend watching!!!!!
1616550414|4.0|It's arrived three days early!<br /><br />It's almost perfect! The only nitpick I have with it is that there are few pages that were stained blue for some reason.<br /><br />I am enjoying it so far!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story. It's incredible to read about how much two people can truly love each other and help each other survive during the worst circumstances and horrible memories. What an awesome crazy twist of a storyline. Never would've guessed it. Great read!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Originally purchased this so I could sharpen a few hunting knifes I had with serrated blades. It works just like it is supposed to. I generally use a stone to sharpen my knives but with to combination of steel and ceramic slots it works good to put a quick edge on some of the knives I have neglected over the years. It also fits nicely in the small pocket of the sheath I have for my larger Knives. I would recommend it is a great value for the price.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I liked this app until I found out that it slows down my phone by running all the time in the background, and can't be killed.  I also found out that you can't even run the foreground part unless you are signed into Amazon!  No thanks.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|This game ROCKS!!! I'm having no problems at all and too much fun!!! Don't take my word for it, find out for yourself!!!
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I am addicted to this show! The actors are greats and the story line is thrilling. Make sure when you watch it you have a big bowl of popcorn.<br /><br />Above were my comments for season 1.  Just finished Season 2 wow TV shows do not get any better! Can hardly wait to start watching season 3. Don't forget if you are a Prime Amazon member you can watch it for free. I bought a rouk and I am streaming Amazon love this. The rouk was easy to set up even for me a 60 year old women. I am going to cut back on my cable bill maybe even cancel cable.<br /><br />Damages is a great TV show and the acting with Helen Hunt is super! Why a main network didn't go after this show is beyond me all regular TV shows now are junk. Tired of watching reality shows that just show people fighting and yelling at each other with no acting skills and no plot.<br />Helen Hunt is one of our greatest female actresses! This is TV the way it was meant to be.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I liked it because when I'm doing my homework I miss some words alot. So being able to go on my tablet and go to this app made it more helpful.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|This was well written and entertaining. It gave me some breakfast to improve my sales techniques. The author uses interesting stories mixed with relevant theories to convey his message.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to  communication better.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love most of the songs.  I love this show mostly because of the music!  I hope they keep it up.  The duets are always my favorites!
B005MLP71Y|5.0|Love the plot, characters and the graphics.  Jerry Seinfeld is funny and all the supporting bees are fun characters to get to know too.  Worth watching!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Love it, so cute:) and I can actually let my children watch it, what a relief. Now days seems like cartoons are made more for us adults.  This one is one of our favorites.
1452110581|5.0|Plumbs the depths of the soul, by dealing with such hard-hitting questions as:<br />- Why don't you like my dead mouse?<br />- Why won't you play with me at 3 am?<br />- Why is faucet water so much better than cat dish water?<br />- How could you bring a new kitten into our house?<br />- What do you mean, quit clawing those curtains?<br /><br />They're easier to ask when it's literature.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box is very interesting, one of the best Harry Bosch stories. I recommend it to all Michael Connelly fans.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. I can play with my horse when I am stuck waiting some where. I just wish that thhere were puzzles.
0761158820|5.0|We have made about 5 of these and it really keeps my child's attention.  Parents need to be involved in helping because there are some really small and precise folds that you need to make.  The graphics are fantastic and they punch out effortlessly.  It's FUN!
B00683JK9K|3.0|Just a few puzzles.  Can get thru them in a couple of days. Ok for what few are there' need more.
B002FGU3ZE|3.0|These sandals do their job but do not let them in the sunlight for hours or the inner soil will simply come apart. They are comfortable to wear for long period of time but be aware that your feet will end up sweaty and smelly afterwards.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie was funny colorful and entertaining. It was good for children and adults. I would definitely recommend  this movie.
B005LAII80|5.0|...& the extras are dreamy. Can't wait to get a 3D telly to watch this in all of its splendor.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I thought this was just going to be a One Hit Wonder with &#34;Thrift Shop&#34;, but every song is solid. &#34;Same Love&#34; and &#34;Make the Money&#34; are really amazing and make you actually think. Great rap album that is different from what you usually hear.
1439153663|5.0|I am so enjoying reading this book.  It shows how caring and wise the black slaves were.  I have recommended it to many friends.
B0039NK0LE|5.0|Great movie, great price, great addition to my movie library. Friends are stealing my copies becasue they want to it so bad.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Everyone I know who has watched an episode feels compelled to watch it all. I love it and everyone I know loves it. This set was fabulous.
0440246016|5.0|I was introduced to Lee Child's  Reacher series books by my brother.  I was thrilled by his first three  and now have every one he has wtitten although  I have most of them I am looking forward to reading.  Once you get started it's very hard to put one down!  Highly recommended!
B00A9X9VAI|4.0|I thought this was a great movie, kept me wondering where it was going right up until the very end. Bruce Willis was just ok. Emily Blunt and Joseph Gordon Leavitt were great, but the real star of the show was the young boy who played Blunt's son. What a little scene stealer!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Great problem-solving game.  My 9-year-old and I are both equally enthralled by it.  It is cute, challenging, nonrepetitive, and unique.  Highly recommended! Enjoy!
B007THA4FI|4.0|So different from Potter that Rowling seems to be trying to change her style from the Potter Series. From the mystical to the reality of interpersonal relationships in a real world she relates how people &#34;live and move and have their being&#34; trying to cope while both falling and rising. No fantasy here but the real world which demands valuing human life or watching it self-destruct in front of us. Her next book with be interesting and we shall see if there is a new direction or just a divergence for a while.<br />Circuit Rider
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Mr. Riordan has written another very entertaining book. Flowing seamlessly from his previous series<br />we are introduced to another set of demi gods and a whole new set of Greek myths and quests ensue.<br />Entertaining, fun and educational, what else do you need.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Tarantino's latest film takes us further into his \\"white guilt revenge\\" trend, with Django Unchained. To Tarantino's credit, instead of making a heavy handed repeat lesson of \\"slavery bad, tolerance good\\", it's simply a gratuitous revenge flick where Django will kill any whitey that's in his way between him and his woman, and there's a lot to this film that makes it great. Hell I'd say Django Unchained & Cabin in the Woods were easily the most entertaining movies of 2012, and considering Django's almost 3 hour running time, that's impressive.<br /><br />So it starts out where King Schultz, a bounty hunter, finds and frees Django since he holds vital information for the next target, and after Django's freed King decides to hire Django as a partner. King was played well by Christopher Waltz, who leads the show for the first half of Django Unchained. They take out a few bounties, and Django slowly grows accustomed to freedom and \\"killin white folk for money\\". The whole first half feels a lot like a spaghetti western, where they travel from town to town chasing bounties, and their friendship is shown well as Jamie Foxx & Christopher Waltz play off each other well.<br /><br />After King is satisfied with catching a good amount of bounties with Django, he helps his assistant find his estranged wife, whom is located at Calvin Candie's plantation. They meet up with Candie during a mandingo fight, and tell him a story they weaved where they're both mandingo fans and want to purchase one of his for a large sum of money. So because of the ridiculous amount of money offered, Candie takes them to his plantation, where you see a lot of interesting things develop. First off, King becomes more and more cold footed about how Candie mistreats his slaves, he swallows the mandingo's killing each other, but it's like he realizes he's going into the heart of darkness and is struggling to contain his revulsion. In turn, this is where you see Django start to lead the show, as he's accustomed to the cruelty, he knows how to handle himself. And because he plays his character of an Uncle Tom so well, Candie is literally amazed and lets Django go on pushing the Candie employees and slaves around. There's a lot of character development in their short ride to Candieland.<br /><br />finally when they arrive, Django meets a rival Uncle Tom, Stephen, who is played by the hilarious Samuel L. Jackson, who instantly attempts to put Django in his place in front of the other slaves to establish his dominance. Stephen is fascinating because he seems like the real power behind Candieland, as Samuel L. Jackson himself put it: the Dick Cheney of Candieland. We see him running it when Candie's gone, telling Candie the what's-what behind their mystery guests, and is generally keeping everyone in line whilst Calvin enjoys the easy life of being 'Massa'. Just the way Stephie leans on Calvin's chair at dinner and nods his head to everything Calvin says is hilariously symbolic of their relationship.<br /><br />And speaking of their relationship, they totally parallel off of King and Django's relationship as basically black and white partners of the era. King and Candie are the overtly friendly white guys, trading nothing but smiles between each other and talking pleasantries, while Django and Stephen are quietly assessing their situation and coldly sizing each other up as black rivals.<br /><br />Eventually things go south for King & Django in Candieland, and the irony of it all is because of King's nature to dive into situations under a ruse. Candie would've probably sold Hilda for cheap to King, and it would make sense since he would want a German speaking slave. But since King decided to set up an elaborate ruse, things go bad, and Django has to shoot his way out of Candieland in one of the most over-the-top bloodbaths I've seen since Kill Bill Vol. 1. Similar to Cabin in the Woods \\"let's get this party started\\" scene, my face lit up with glee and was completely mesmerized by the carnage on screen.<br /><br />So nearing the end of the film the story starts to drag out a little with the Australians escorting the slaves to the Winn Dickey Mining company, which is apparently worse than death according to Stephen. Even though the story's noticeably starting to sag everything is so well done that it's really hard to fault, and some of the film's best moments happen in the last 20 minutes, so really it's more of an observation than a complaint.<br /><br />So this movie was really f***ing entertaining the whole way through, the music choices were superb, the acting was well done, and the film hit all the right marks regarding tone. When it was comedic people were laughing, when it was suspenseful people were quiet, etc. The cinematography was also gorgeous, one scene that sticks out the most for me is near the end when the villains are walking together in the dark, Tarantino undoubtedly knows his s*** when it comes to making a fun movie, and I appreciate that it simply wants to entertain rather than tell you a message.<br /><br />Oh speaking of that let's talk about the racism, lets just say Tarantino doesn't pull any punches, but as he's argued it's all accurate of the time (well maybe except mandingo fighting). The slaves don't look like polished supermodels, the N word is used liberally, and ultimately the film just turns slavery on it's head and shows you one slave taking revenge to save his wife. Another thing to note is the violence, when it's against blacks its very realistic and sober, but when it's against the whites it's really over the top and hilarious.<br /><br />I admit I felt burned out of Tarantino when I went into this, since I think he hasn't made a really great film since Jackie Brown (although Inglorious Bastards had some really high points), but this I would say is one of his better films, and definitely stands out against all of the Tarantino-imitation directors out there.ed by the carnage on screen.<br /><br />So nearing the end of the film the story starts to drag out a little with the Australians escorting the slaves to the Winn Dickey Mining company, which is apparently worse than death according to Stephen.

B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Good plot with an excellent message. Probably will become one of my favorite movies of all time. Check it out!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Good story line, albeit a bit unbelievable at times, but, hey, it is fiction after all, right? I kind of missed the first person writing as done in Mr. Child's introduction of Jack Reacher.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig as Bond is like a perfect marriage for fans of the beloved franchise. Skyfall gives you this whole other side to Bond, the human side. You see Bond get shot for only like the 2nd or 3rd time in the arm and you see Bond cry which never happens. Don't get me wrong Sean Connery as the first Bond ever is great when you take out the facts of him being a rapist in Goldfinger and a woman beater in Diamonds are Forever. Just because he won the role as Bond and for the next 50 years be type casted does not make him the best of all time. Can't help that he was first, he be 3rd in my list of the best Bonds it be Craig, Pierce, than him. He is kind of prick, too much. What do I know. I think Skyfall is just the best Bond in the series as of right now.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Once this book got going it was hard to put down. However, I kept waiting for some great ending and I could not have been more disappointed. I felt the story fell flat at the end. 2/3 of the book is incredibly written, but it was like the author ran out of steam at the end.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|All movies arrived in excellent shape and have been watched many times by our family.  A great trilogy to enjoy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This bible app is the best available for all ages! It includes every version available with audio feedback (on most sections, some includes all sections with audio). Great plans for anyone. Recent updates aren't my cup o' tea with advertisements and plans made by third parties but it's overall an excellent choice!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|A really sizzling mystery that builds right up to the grand climax. A true who dunnit in the first person style not experienced since the Matt Helm era.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I liked this game its fun and entertaining for all ages.  Im a sucker for a good hidden object game anyways.  i got mine while it was free but i wouldve paid for it tho.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this in December sort of on a whim.  Also because it's cold out and getting to the gym seems to happen only in my head and not in reality lately.  I would describe myself as formerly athletic.  Currently moderately athletic (ran a half marathon in November, do some weights, some cardio) and 15 lbs over my ideal weight.  Even when I exercise consistently (like marathon/half marathon training), I have not been able to lose weight.<br /><br />This DVD helped me lose 10 lbs over the holiday season, and I didn't try that hard (diet wise - I ate those Christmas cookies, no problem).  I completed 20 of the 30 prescribed days over December and January (20 workouts over 2 months).  I rotated the levels each day to avoid boredom.  The fact that it's over in 20-25 minutes meant it got done more consistently.  It also didn't leave me hungrier than usual (like running has).  And yet, I felt like I did get a workout in.  After the first 6 workouts, I noticed visible differences.  I've kept the weight off (again without trying hard) for almost two months now.<br /><br />I'm now one of those crazy people who recommends this DVD to anyone that discusses any weight issue with me.  For less than $10, I recommend you give it a try.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Great comic to movie conversion and tie in for the Avengers plot arc.  Always been a huge fan of comics and surprisingly well handled for on screen presentation without going too \\"mythic\\". Plus they got Natalie Portman as the love interest - that has got to be worth something!
B007RTAR64|5.0|perfect, looks awesome, has everything it shows in the box, ( although it won't be opened.) Absolutely happy with the purchase

B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great show; you have to watch from the start.  I usually don't really like this kind of drama, but it is just so well done.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Sure glad I caught up with this fabulous Mr White before I left this planet.<br />Saw him on the Grammys, which is not my favorite place for music because it was so mainstream<br />in the past, but I went nuts when I saw and heard him 2/10/13 and immediately ordered his cd.<br />I used to see Led Zep at the Fillmore West and Winterland in SF and was a HUGE fan.<br />So glad this Jack White is around with his own style of music which has hints of Plant and Page.<br />Five Stars-A real Gem
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. Denzel is a marvelous actor.greatbplot. Unloved the twist atbthebend of the movie. A very good movie.
B002N2LEVM|5.0|Dollhouse had a lot of potential.<br />This would have turned into a great series except for Fox.<br />This can be said more and more as time goes on. Last episodes<br />have a rushed feeling to them. i believe they were trying to end the story line.

B009CCBCU4|4.0|I need book 3. Do not want to write more.  The stars say enough.<br />NO, no, no . no.  no.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Angry Birds Rio is pretty good but I don't care for the beach one. Just like playing Angry Birds when I have the time.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]<br /><br />The greatest movie of all time! The one you saw again and again and again. You got the toys, the records, the books. You played it. You lived it. You loved it.<br /><br />Now you can own it. Pure. Beautiful. Unbastardized.<br /><br />I know a lot of fans like Empire the best but without Star Wars, there never would never have been an Empire or Jedi, or Holiday special. Ok, forget that last one.<br /><br />I watched both versions and was amazed at how good the original holds up. Funny, nobody ever complained about how the originals looked. Hopefully Disney will give the fans a purer version.<br /><br />Till then, May the force be with you.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Loved it Captivated every page. Held me with every word.<br />I have read all his books, and this one is so great.
B005R32L66|5.0|This is working fantastic on my GTablet. Setup was easy and fast. Now I can move around with it running
B004I2K4E8|5.0|I saw this production on TV not too long ago and couldn't wait to have it on DVD.  The movie was good.  This is GREAT.  I get chills during every musical number.  Awesome.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I played nevosofts last hidden object game and on this one they fixed the zoom so that's good but they still hide things beyond the viewing area (like under the timer) also they shouldn't penalize u for too many taps when ur viewing with the &quot;flashlight&quot;
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I can't describe how bad this movie was. Others have done so. Nevertheless I must weigh in. The Trailer's for this film had me on the edge of my seat. I thought for certain this was going to be a billion dollar hit. The answers to thirty years of wondering would finally be answered.<br /><br />What we got instead was a bait and switch and plot holes large enough to fly a Star Destroyer through.<br /><br />Let's start with the bait and switch. The imagery from the commercial leads one to believe that we will find out who the 'space jockey,' as he's known was and how his ship came to crash on LV426. But very soon in the film we learn this is not LV426 so this can't be the space jockey from Alien.<br /><br />They tricked us!<br /><br />With regards to the plot holes, I won't go into all of them, (my lunch break is only an hour). But seriously, a crew of scientists spend a few years and 1 trillion dollanrs getting to an alien planet and are about to enter a structure obviously built by intelligent life, yet nobody is allowed to bring a weapon?<br /><br />And the guy who maps out the alien space ship can't find his way off the space ship?<br /><br />I can mapquest my way to Dunkin Donuts to within 1/10th of a mile. And they're in the future!<br /><br />In screen writing 101 (which I took) the teacher would circle the above passages and mark on your paper 'lazy writing.' Or 'Not logical.' Then he'd tell you to try harder.<br /><br />I could go on but why bother. Another thing that disturbed me was how people made statements like 'people didn't get it.' Or, 'Some viewers just couldn't understand what was going on.'<br /><br />Right. I'm stupid. Not the people in the movie.<br /><br />Then they said something like, 'all your questions will be answered in the next film.'<br /><br />Not for me they won't.<br /><br />Just my opinion<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B007NG93CK|5.0|Loved it Captivated every page.<br />Well worth getting.<br />I love the way she gets you right into the book from page 1
B004RZGUBM|5.0|All these books would fill a large bookcase and I have them all here on my Kindle! Actually, all my Kindles since I own several and my husband own a couple too. I love having all Dickens' stuff to read. I can skip from short stories to books and read the Christmas stuff at Christmas time and then go back to whatever I was reading before. Everything looks nice and is easy to read and the table of contents works great. If you like Dickens you will really appreciate this collection. Dickens was hilarious at times and the short stories aren't much talked about but they are nice too.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I thought this was going to be super lame but the trailer looked ok.  It was really funny and didn't take itself too seriously.  Fun times.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wondered why someone in my book club had recommended the book after I had only read the early part. Then, because it was a book club selection, I continued to read. I'm glad I did. It became so intriguing that I couldn't put it down.
B004R63MWQ|1.0|To me, Tron legacy represents the adult realization that just because you liked something as a child doesn't mean it will hold up when you're an adult. Case in point; Tron, a mediocre B movie from the early 80s which had some cool special effects though in a bad way even by 80s standards. But the idea was novel; a man is trapped in a video game. It was a boring film, but people liked it, mainly because they were children and didn't know any better.<br /><br />Fast forward something like twenty-eight years to Tron Legacy. Great potential. I admit, I was blown away by the trailer. The notion of Jeff Bridges' son following him into the digital world to find/rescue him was outstanding. The thought of how the digital world has developed a-la the internet kept my mind racing.<br /><br />Truth be told, the movie was boring. It was great to see 'The Dude,' in the digital world battling a younger version of himself. And the effects were outstanding. But you'd think after twenty-eight years they'd have come up with some kind of a plot. Don't get me wrong Tron Legacy has a lot of bells and whistles. Not to mention eye candy.<br /><br />But seriously, the bad guys can't find the dude who's living by himself on a mountain within eye sight of the city? He's the only one on the mountain. You can see a light coming from his house! Nobody ever asked; I wonder who lives up there?<br /><br />The Matrix covered this ground better.<br /><br />When I hear people raving about how great it was, it reminds me of all those guys back in 97 coming out of 'The Phantom Menace,' Light Sabers in hand, for the tenth time saying things like, 'This one just sets things up.' And 'George will come out swinging with the next one. You'll see.'<br /><br />Just my opinion.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B0085TKAW6|5.0|This is a great book. It is so full of history, and his research and insight are stunning.<br />This is a great buy
B0091REZMW|1.0|this game has way too many hoops to jump through to enjoy playing. every other room is in the dark .  even if you find the things on the list it will tell you you failed tonfind anything. it is just to complicated to be fun.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The visuals are stunning on this BD; This BD is far superior to the DVD versions; The sound is spectacular; This BD also allows you to PAUSE, POWER OFF, POWER UP, and PLAY, continuing from the same point as you PAUSEd; This BD has obviously been created by expert craftspeople;
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Our son-in-law reported that the whole family (parents and children--6, 8, and 10) has enjoyed the game. It was a Christmas gift.
B005LAII12|5.0|By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]<br /><br />This movie is one of the best of 2012. It's a laugh-out-loud hilarious comedy about growing up or not. I saw it in a packed theater. There are parts of this movie where Ted says something and the audience laughs, then he says something else but you can't hear it cause you're still laughing. I liked all the pop cultural references as well as the appearance of Sam Jones, from 1980's Flash Gordon, (which I saw in the theater twice in one day!)McFarlane knows his stuff.<br /><br />Much of it's success I believe comes from the fact it was released a week or two after Prometheus, but due to bad word of mouth, Prometheus suffered a 70% drop in ticket sales in it's second week. There was nothing to see and Ted found it's audience. It would dominate the box office until the release of 'The Amazing Spiderman' some four weeks later.<br /><br />See this movie. If you're in your 40s, you'll really get it.
076781214X|5.0|I loved this blast from the past. Nicholas Cage is great in this movie and I watched it twice in a row. Great for something to do.
B0097UO87U|2.0|Not sure why all of this talent was wasted on putting out an album of 'classics' but I guess if Rod Stewart, Paul McCartney, Barry Manilow, etc. can do it, why not everyone? Let's hope that Paul Westerberg, Paul Weller, or Billy Bragg never get to that point...
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect but it's a great view into the Iraq war and a great book. It still hard to think that Chris survived all this horror in Iraq just to be gunned down here at home. If your thinking about reading this book I can tell you it's well worth your time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ok at first. I didn't like it but I played some more now I love it love it love it I love my hires I just. wish it were eased to get diamonds
B0095G5AFU|4.0|i like it because i can separate all my happy thoughts into one book and the ugly stuff in another one.  just need to remember to back all the way out so it will wipe out the password
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is the best app because you can care for the horse but the horse its not real.  I love this app.  you must get this app it amazing cool awesome too. buy this game.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show, the acting is superb.  I am so glad I was able to see Season 2.  I just started watching Season 3 this year, and it was helpful that I now know more about the characters.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent story by a truly awesome man. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants truth and inspiration. These are the folks that keep us safe and free ! We have lost a great American hero....
B00AYXNKIC|4.0|Great courses, spring load works awesome, really like the way that the high rise tracks make you learn skill to be able to get the stares, and the wind fans that blow you around are tricky, but fun
B0096A9QXC|5.0|for someone who is video game challenged, this is a good one to play.  Fast paced, fun, and you get to try to be your score from before.  Getting to a new level is like WOOHOOO!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|This helps me out alot.  I get to learn how to use products and review stuff before i purchase I love this site!  Thanks
B00005N6KG|4.0|I don't think these would work well if you were jogging, but it you are just sitting listening to music or a movie, they are<br />great. Good quality, very lightweight. Recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|FUN AND ADDICTIVE is what I'd call it.  Good at passing time or if your just bored and have nothing to do.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I really loved the book but while I was reading it I kept thinking that it was so familiar. As it turns out, it was very familiar to me because it is so much like Rose Madder by Stephen King. Granted she does not go into another world by escaping through a painting, but a lot of the story line is the same. Still a good read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|First off, I never go out of my way to write reviews but I really think this product deserves some recognition. I bought some other Anker products and they were all well priced and did what they were supposed to. This mouse tho blows me away. I love the customization of colors. I can set different colors on different modes settings of the mouse. I use this mouse mainly as an extension to media. I work with producing music and I needed a new mouse to access things faster and make my overall DAW easier to use. This mouse allows me to do just this. The ability to change the settings on the mouse is pretty cool so that I can have settings for just browsing the internet when I need a break and listening to music. The mouse is very high quality and the 40 dollars spent on it is measly compared to what I think it's worth.<br /><br />My only suggestion for future changes is to maybe add in some more slots so I can customize my mouse. I can only currently toggle between two different presets on the mouse so I use one for regular browsing and one for when I need to work on some music in my DAW. I wouldnt mind having a 3rd or 4th option to save my mouse settings. Besides this, this mouse is def an awesome upgrade. I went from a regular standard logitech mouse to this, totally worth it. A+
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Churches are using the Facebook and if I'm going through something my friends are there to help with a word I can talk to family too
0316228532|4.0|While reading, I kept being reminded of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;, except there's no Clarence. And instead of a man being shown the difference his life had made, here the other characters see how different life turns out to be when he is no longer part of the equation in village life and politics. Unlike a Harry Potter tale, there is no hero being groomed to sacrifice himself and destroy the arch-villain, and, indeed, there is no arch-villain. There's only the ordinary greedy, self-centered, well-meaning-yet-deeply-flawed folk left to sort it all out.<br />I was intrigued and drawn into this cauldron of characters and opposing agendas. Several personal story lines compete for attention, brewing and bubbling until in the end, behold, maybe there was a personality developing all along to bring a glimmer of hope, an unexpected redemption of sorts.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I've been playing temple run for a long time and it  was great and this is incredible!! 4 stars for no Montana Smith.  :(
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Another book I had a hard time putting down.  The characters were rich--clever, fun, good, evil, romantic, they had it all!!!!  Descriptions were amazing, all in all a great book for a rainy day--or any day really.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I started reading this book with thoughts of the Will Smith movie in mind. The book has many differences from the movie, but if anything I like it more. I literally could not stop reading it, which included during class and breaks at work. I finished it in a couple of days. It was well worth the money I spent on it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington is amazing men i love all the Denzel Washington movies. keep doing your thing Denzel ,very powerful and inspirational.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|endless information on about anything. I have only had my Kindle Fire a few days, but luckily I discovered 'FLIPBOARD'. It's right<br />up to the minute on news, sports, music, anything you're interested in. I LOVE it.  Try it,  you will too.
B009OA57MI|5.0|This game is so awesome!!!!!!!! By the way,I did read the one star reviews(which is the best thing to do) and all most didn't buy it!!!! And to think that I would be missing out on all the fun that I've been having!!!!!! Any way, I actually accidentally bought<br />this....... I was actually really pissed at myself for a moment but... I thought about it a little bit and of course, I have the lite version also so for two bucks,I think that (even though I was pissed at myself) it was a great deal, because Instead of having one plane (not complaining) you get 3. And instead of just landing and atacking things, you also get to use rescue missions. So in the long run I probably will regret it but for now, BYE, I'M OFF TO PLAY!!!!!!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. I use it to escape from my work on my lunch breaks. It's a good brain teaser!
B009VB97EY|5.0|Fun and flirty film. Saw movie in theater - deleted scenes and all other extras make purchasing the DVD worth it.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I love this book sooooooooooo  much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy it and read it I did you need to too.Emily rose horton get it
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|I adored this! I feel like BVB has really grown up with their music and this album shows it! So many woderful songs. Jinxx's string work was marvelous. Loved this product.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Didn't enjoy it, in fact I didn't finish it, very disappointed overall, wouldn't recommend it it really was 'hopeless' reading.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very fun and addicting but there is a slight chance that you will have your game stats wiped cleanother than that it is very fun
0374275637|2.0|How many times can the same thing be said?  There are a few good real life references here from the author's research, but that's it. Don't be fooled by the strong ratings, this is a slow, plodding read.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's really fun kind of challenging but it's a really good game for people who are quick with there fingers.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I adore MCR's music and DD was no dissapointment. MCR has grown and their music has followed. Don't get me wrong I love revenge, bullets and the bp and this album was just as amazing!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game.  It is so addicting.  I recommend this game to everyone.  it is 100% better than Temple Run 1
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is.one of my favorite apps.It is extremely addictive. I like how.you do not have to tilt your divice.
B000JLSM00|5.0|I was glad to hear that an old classic was redone in blu-ray! Love it. It's a classic I just had to add to my collection.
B0093X80VQ|4.0|I think that the author of the book did a good job at writing the book. He kept me entertained most of the time. That's why I rated the book this way.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|This is the only place we were able to find this to purchase.  Price was good and husband is very happy with it.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Modern nonfiction drama. Can't believe it's still going on. This man (boy) was featured on 60 minutes.<br />I kept asking myself: why doesn't the U.S. do something about this? Why isn't this being publicised?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! I give it a 10 out of 10!!!! AMAZING! I absolutely loved it! Absolute BEST book ever!!!! (=
B004FRX0MY|4.0|It was fairly easy but at the same time I had trouble downloading the music and had to try at lest 3 -4 time before it finally took.<br /><br />I am more familiar with Amazon MP3 now.
B006ISJQ1W|5.0|This is the only place we were able to find this to purchase.  Price was good and husband is very happy with it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Extremely well written. Keeps you guessing. Many twists. When you think you have figured it out, you have to shift gears.
1451626657|5.0|For quite a few years I've ignored this book simply because its a work of fiction and who needs that when there are so many quality true stories out there to read? Well I recently bit the bullet and read this book to see if it lived up to the hype. It sure did. What a rich and engaging cast of flawed but interesting characters! They reminded me of some of the men I served with, especially the young and romantic Nately. His naivety mirrored that of not only my friends but also my own self at that age (though I was much to innocent to try and romance a prostitute!). I would highly recommend this book to anyone in need of a laugh at the insanity of war.
B000FC1HQY|4.0|An interesting expose of the inner workings of family and how one's childhood and ennvironment are strong influencers for one's adult life.  Fuller so acuarately captures childhood as a white child in Africa.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|This is as stated and a great addition to any collection of old shows.  Loved by my husband and a great addition.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|this games has beautiful graphics and I love the mix of puzzles with mystery . well done thanks for the great game. can't wait for sequel

B004LP3AYI|4.0|This was as good, if not better than the first book. I can't wait to read the next book. Downloading now!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Takes a different view of selling than the usual &#34;pitch&#34; approaches still advocated by many.  If only more sales people and organizations would adopt these recommendations...
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My daughter saw this in the theater with her Grandmother and loved it.  When it came out on DVD we rented it rather than purchased because I thought she'd get bored with it after a time or two.  Well not only does she love it but so do I!  It's a super cute move that she's been asking to watch over and over so I had to buy it!  Highly recommend and it's totally a kid movie.  No grown up, inappropriate references.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app a lot. I like how you can update  every half hour or less  or at different times. The social is good and I really like the video and the alerts, especially for the allergies.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|The Affair, is actually one of my favorites and I have read them all. The character development is fantastic, I found myself hoping for the best in regards to the Sherriff. Plus it gives us context as to how Reacher started down this road. More prequels would be great, after a while you have to suspend disbelief that so many mysteries happen to one man. However I have read every Reacher novel, and will continue as long as Lee Child continues to write them.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Simple writing style. Easy to digest story. Relate-able characters. The topic lends itself to preach to the reader but the author abstains.
B009IAIBAE|1.0|Why did they have to go with the picture discs? Picture discs sound awful and these are no exception.  I still have my old Maiden records from the 80's and these do not compare. They lack the punch and kick that the original vinyl had.  I don't get it.  Aren't the original album covers cool enough to look at? It's a shame.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|The led doesn't work on my kindle. Keeps saying my camera is in use by something else. (which I don't understand.) This is my first kindle fire hd and I'm still trying to learn about it. However the whole screen lights up so it would give me light in case of emergency.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|If you have seen the trailers for Ted, then you've seen most of the funny bits.<br />Story is trite, but the laughs are big and spread through out the entirety of the film.<br />The humor is aimed directly at Seth MacFarlane's fan base and it will surely hit<br />big with them.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love reading series. The problem is that the series either ends abruptly, I have to wait to long for the next in line, or it drags on too long and becomes watered down. Wool does not fit into any of these categories! I could not put this down and I really loved how everything builds on the last book before it. Highly recommend this to any lover of close to reality science fiction.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|We should all know the Snow White story by now. There have been many incarnations of it in film and books. This one stands out in it's visual effects. It is a really beautiful and spooky film. It may borrow a bit much from Hayao Miyazaki's &#34;Princess Mononoke&#34;, but I loved that film so it's not all bad. Charlize Theron stands out as the evil queen. Yowzah, she's neat.
0307341577|1.0|This book is a piece of garbage written by a woman who I would not like to know.  What kind of person must she be to write the kinds of things she writes? YES, I understand that this is fiction; I understand that this is made up and she's writing in character. But I can't even fathom what must be going on in her mind to even THINK of the horrible observations she makes on humanity.<br /><br />For the author to write these things - even in character - she must have a very dark side. She seems to be a vicious, nasty woman. I feel sorry for her family and friends having to read what she wrote.<br /><br />I won't continue reading this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am addicted to this game (I have the second highest score in the world with amazon gamecircle), my only problem is the when I go to do upgrades whenever i scroll down the page l, whatever you touch it buys automatically (that's a full blown 30000 coins... didn't buy what I wanted to) , if they would get a confirmation check then I would be completely satisfied<br />-BOsman97
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is both relaxing and stimulating. The music is really nice and calming but the puzzles can be really challenging. I keep coming back to this app and haven't been bored yet!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Easy to affix and very durable. Cleans easily and offers good screen protection. A good buy that I would recommend.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Now one of my all time favorite Christmas movies and no doubt the funniest, I recommend this movie for everyone to see.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My husband, 10 year old son, and I enjoyed this movie. The singing was good, and the story was cute.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great graphics and interaction. Very cool game. Easy to use and very fun.<br />Would recommend for everyone in the family.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Successful execution of the popular film. I like the singer in the movie, and her voice, very successfully emphasizes mood and content. A successful hit.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait for the next book. Once I start reading I can't put the book down.  I look forward to more books and stories like this.
0307463745|5.0|Every page is amazing and I love that they distilled this book down to its essence. I don't need to read the same thing written 7 different ways so that the author feels good about the length of their book. Rework will blow your mind.
0940322897|3.0|I heard of this book when I watched the movie &#34;Fahrenheidt 451.  I had to get it to read for myself

B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I couldn't put it down. What a great read! If you are a WW 2buff or just looking for a good story this book is for you
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the quality of writing but did not relate to the characters.  It is sad but probably a reflection of many relationships.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I Like this hidden object game.  It is worth the zero dollars I paid for it.  A little on the easy user mode but still entertaining.

B006LSZECO|1.0|Cant get it to work on my kindle and ate the price of the book.  Wish I could find a way to get back my money
0316228532|5.0|I was unsure about this book with all the negative reviews, but I found it \\"unputdownable.\\"  Yes, maybe it's dark, maybe it's sad but it was also riveting from the get-go.  True to life happenings in a small town.  As one other reviewer put it, it was thought-provoking, and definitely not a mindless read.  I'd highly recommend it for some entertaining, albeit sometimes sad reading.

B00846F1YW|5.0|If you are looking for a hidden object game then this one is about as good as it gets.<br />fun extra puzzles. I got it free so that makes it even better. No money needed to play so it is a full game not a trial version. It is timed so you have to complete your mission in that time or you have to start over. Might be difficult for the younger age group.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places is written similarly to &#34;Gone Girl&#34;. You get a little taste of what's going on in the present, but then she tosses in a chapter from the past from various character standpoints for background. This constant back and forth builds really nice suspense since it always keeps you guessing.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I love this movie series & i watch them at least once a month & this is what i needed to complete my set
B003U69IX6|3.0|The writers took liberties with the source material that I though were completely appropriate, however, they kept going until the end result was a cliched mess from beginning to end. Good action sequences, afternoon popcorn cruncher when you're surfing the web and want something on in the background.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In what is a rare look inside the life of America's elite fighting force, I am inspired to do more for those that return. Chris exemplifies the meaning of courage under fire, not only in combat but in his complex dealings between his civilian and military life. His loss has been greatly felt, especially here in Dallas. Rest in peace Punisher.
B001QWQJ4C|5.0|I love all these movies & watch them at least once a month.. Never a disappointment.. Thank you very much
1451695195|5.0|I received this book one afternoon, had it read by the next afternoon; I could not put it down. The most awesome book and so well written. Dr Alexander seems to be a wonderful , caring person.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me crying/ laughing at the same time, it has a great love story in it!  I highly recommend this book.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|I have experienced some confusion while seeking to locate all episodes for viewing this product. Also, in my eforts to edit my paymment methods I initially have experienced rejection upon submiting proper infirmation relating to the method of payment. Another issue occurs while viewing this product when &#34;intense action scenes&#34; freeze and unfreeze while audio continues normally. This aside, the product has great potential and I am a loyal fan of the Supernatural series. seasons, and episodes and YES I would highly recommend it to all!
B0055SWM08|5.0|a soothing meditative puzzle with just the right pace and grace. particularly fond of the sound design and score. addictively relaxing.
B00005O3VC|5.0|this movie was great had a lot of funny lines. . . . . . . . . . .
B004SGWYW4|4.0|As the title suggests, this series has everything one could want from a grindhouse type movie, the action getting started really fast in a way that sort of reminded me of the original Dawn of the Dead. I tend to love the B Roll monster mash zombie films of the era so it definitely appealed to me. It has copious amounts of gore as well as cheesecake, nudity, and a lot more firearm play then one might expect from a cartoon set in Japan. The characters hit all the right notes as an homage as well, from the psychopath survivor who seems to revel in the apocalyptic setting (the sword wielding schoolgirl, Saeko Busujima), the seemingly self centered jerky type survivor (the shrill, condescending Saya Takagi), and even the noble-hearted protagonist survivor who keeps the rest attached to their humanity (schoolboy Takashi Komuro).<br /><br />As is standard with many Japanese cartoons, gender roles as we see them in the west are heavily blurred so if you are alright with roles that, in American films, might be filled by males being played by a female and if the Walking Dead and cavalcade of recent zombie movies haven't gotten you sick to death of them, this one is worth giving a look. If I had to give any criticism it would be that the series sets up a number of fascinating potential scenarios that it never actually explores. As an example, at one point there is a rather creepy pedophilic teacher from the school who leads an entourage of kids. He very much seems like a Captain Rhodes type character who will create big problems later on, yet his plot thread is left largely unresolved. It feels rushed, which is unfortunate, but this rushing definitely shows in the final product.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is great fun, but it's pacing and abrupt end make it feel like a dessert that someone tears away from you after only a couple of bites. While the disappointment isn't enough to cause me to give it a bad rating, I can't give it a high one either as a result.
B0044C3RB4|4.0|Interesting most of the time. Good writing and story lines most of the time. Gets a little cheesy and self indulgent sometimes.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|It is Adele. What else is there to say. Her voice is angelic. The lyrics are magical. A true talent!
B005LAIGSM|2.0|I LIKE BOTH RACHEL MCADAMS AND CHANNING TATUM (DON'T KNOW IF I SPELLED NAME RIGHT), BUT THIS WAS NOT A GOOD MOVIE FOR EITHER OF THEM.  THIS HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE A GREAT MOVIE BECAUSE IT HAS A GOOD STORYLINE, BUT TOO MANY POSSIBLE SCENES BETWEEN THE 2 OF THEM ARE MISSED AND THERE'S ALOT OF UNNECCESSARY FLUFF TAKING THE PLACE OF THAT.  ALSO, THE ENDING DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THE ENDING.  I KEPT WAITING FOR SOMETHING GREAT TO HAPPEN AND IT DIDN'T! I GUESS IF YOU'RE REALLY INTO ROMANTIC MOVIES THIS MAYBE ALITTLE BETTER FOR YOU, BUT IT JUST DIDN'T CUT IT FOR ME.  ONLY ONES (THAT DON'T HAVE COMEDY MIXED IN) WORTH WATCHING MORE THAN ONCE OR TWICE TO ME ARE THE NOTEBOOK AND TITANIC AND THIS ONE REALLY REALLY DOESN'T COMPARE.  I PROBABLY SOUND LIKE A JERK, BUT I ACTUALLY WISH I COULD GET THE TIME I SPENT WATCHING IT AND $10 I SPENT BUYING IT BACK HAHA. I WISH I WOULD HAVE LISTEN TO OTHER REVIEWS.

0439023521|5.0|I just finished reading this book. At the end I gaped a bit at the fact I had run out of pages, then I sat the book down and logged right on to amazon to buy the next two.<br /><br />Hunger Games really is a captivating story, with a world detailed enough to draw you in, even though the world your being drawn into is a gruesome one. As brutal as the games are, as the deaths are, you never forget that they are being watched, some sick capital citizen is finding all of this entertaining. Katniss is truly an exceptional protagonist, I can help but think how lost I would be if thrown into the Hunger Games. In deed I get the feeling some of the tributes didn't expect to survive the duration but just wanted to put off death as long as possible.<br /><br />I haven't seen the movie, but just from the first book, I don't think it can live up to the greatness. I still watch it though, eventually.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Addictive as hell to watch a tortured soul protect others from the evil he experienced and could have become. Love it.
B0035JGYZS|4.0|Plotline was a bit on the predictable side.  Interesting and engaging and good action, but would have liked a bit more unpredictability.
B00005MP58|5.0|We love both this treatment of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and the later Keira Knightly and Matthew McFayden treatment for different reasons. In this edition the actors playing Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins are superior to their portrayals in the later version. This version, while a bit less<br />colorfulnon scenery, seems more realistic to Austen's era. Unlike some reviewers, we think Firth does a superb Darcy. We do like the ending better in the Knightly version.
B000002AGN|5.0|I purchased the CD format of Time Out and have no qualms with it.  The recordings are nice.<br /><br />However, I also received the mp3 (autorip) version for free.  One of my favorite songs, Blue Rondo a la Turk is definitely different from medium to medium.<br />The mp3 version is a slower tempo version.  Also, the the sound of the mp3s are funny to me; specifically, they sound heavy and muddled.<br /><br />I ripped the CD version with EAC (FLAC) to my computer and compared the two files on different headphones (Soundmagic PL50, Etymotic MC5, Sennheiser HD555 and HD600).  All headphones used were plugged into an ASUS Essence STX and played through MediaMonkey using the WASAPI output with no DSP filters enabled on either.  Across all the headphones the sound signature of the mp3s remained fairly constant--heavy and muddy.<br /><br />I have ordered Amazon mp3s in the past with nice results and others with not so much success.  Emi Meyer's Suitcase of Stones album is okay for example.<br /><br />I would most definitely recommend buying the CD version in the case of this album.
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Addictive as hell to watch a tortured soul protect others from the evil he experienced and could have become. Love it.
0374275637|5.0|Excellent book with great ideas and information.  Gave it as a gift and he has really enjoyed it. Good read.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|Good job by Denzel, nothing great but entertaining movie.  The scenes during plane crash were the best part of the movie.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It's a fun movie to watch, the videography is fantastic, good interaction between characters and enough humor to make you smile once in a while.  Would highly suggest this movie for anyone that loves fantasy action adventure.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I ordered this case mostly for the color, price, and that it was prime eligible. It's a great case and I use the standing feature a lot when reading or using the apps.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|Better than some in the Batman series, not as good as others.<br />Entertaining nonetheless.<br />Can't beat Blu-ray on true HD 1080p flatscreens.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was fantastic.  Through the authors description of the past and all the history that was covered I felt that I had in my mind gone back in time.  It was described so throughly that I felt I could actually see the old streets and houses. It was suspenseful and also educating.  When I finished the book, I immediately tried to get the next book; and was devastated to learn that it hasn't been written.  I  am finding it hard to wait for the next book.  Have to find out what happens to everyone!
B0053O89WY|5.0|What can I say about this show that hasn't already been written. It has one of the funniest casts on television and it's very well written.  I do think adding the Amy character wasn't necessary and she's one of the few that I'm not really all that crazy about.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|I very much like the short story form and Alice Munro uses it as proficiently as any living writer. Her writing reflects a<br />keen sensitivy to her characters personalities, but she never allows herself to dwell in maudlin sentiment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|wow.  this version is amazing.  my kid loves it.  the improvements over the original are huge. love the power up format
B0086700CM|1.0|Didn't really like and was not what I thought it was.  I had thought it was another app.  Oh well my fault
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This book was alright but I didnt enjoy it as much as i had hoped. Sparks tries to make it into kind of a thriller and doesnt do such a great job of it. He should stick to mushy love stories...cause we all know he does those so well.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Boring, tedious, slow moving after first 30 minutes or so...I expect more from a Denzel Washington film. A snoozer. I obviously would not recommend it
0316010669|5.0|well written, and informational.  hopefully, i can train myself to be able to &#34;thinly slice&#34; and make good use of this in my profession, Law Enforcement.
0307891402|5.0|Great quality and perfect for the husband. I found it here when I could find it no where else. Shipped fast.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was a really enjoyable game. It keeps your interest. I also liked the fact that you could actually see the items you were searching for! I would definitely recommend this game to others. I haven't always cared for G5 games, but this game has definitely made me willing to give them another try.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|One I have to own!!  It holds on to you from the start.  I would recomend this to all of my family and friends
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|A different kind of country style...puts me in mind of bluegrass.  This cd is a great blend of both styles of music.  Highly recommend it.
B005NQ5LQ4|5.0|I have the Yip Man movies with Donnie Yen, and this one fit in well. Although a different actor, it was a great movie.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Smith has a great writing style.  Lots of twists and excitement.  I literally could not put this book down.  Purchased it as a &#34;super saver&#34; from Amazon and hadn't heard of the author before, but took a chance.  Glad I did!  I will definitely read more books by this author!
B004R63MWQ|5.0|Awesome movie and have been totally blown away with the change up from the original to the newest one. Definitely got my money's worth.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|works wonderfully on kindle fire. I also have the ez pdf reader, which does rotate and offers better visuals, but I like that adobe has better highlighting function ... we just need to be able to rotate!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have had this app and the original and I will go back as nd redo the levels. It's a good puzzle time waster!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Couldn't find anything remotely as great in Google's Play Store, so I ended up downloading amazon apps to my android tablet JUST for this app. So glad I did!!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Im having trouble getting the time right.  Have not mastered it yet.  Will now doubt need help.. I will keep trying
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It' a great game and I think it's even better than temple run its really fun. You should really get it. It's a great game there's different types of peeps to use once you get enough coins that is. Also another thing is that you cant just use the surf board whenever you want you can only use them when that come in a mystery box.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I owned a LifeProof cover previously and loved it, I had zero issues with the case.  My original cover lasted six months and i only replaced it because wear had made the case no longer water resistant.  The new cover has a fatal flaw, no one can hear me when I speak. I had to remove the case to have a conversation on my phone.  Not only was the case waterproof, but it was sound proof as well.<br /><br />I gave the case three starts because the first cover I had was perfect.  Because the second case is not usable I had to knock off a few of the stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you've figured it out, you're proved completely wrong. This is an extremely entertaining story. Worth every minute that kept me awake.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I really do not enjoy this can.  It get to  complicated some times.  I just don't think buying coin to keep up is worth it
B001H5X7JS|5.0|DVD plays fine for amazingly low price I got it at, was glad to be able to nab up this film cause it's freakin' *hilarious.*  If you want a gauge on my opinion, I *hate* The Hangover and Superbad, but love Shaolin Soccer and Domino.  Basically, if you like awesome movies, and hate ones that suck, you'll enjoy this film.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Could not put this book down.  Good read for all people of all ages.  Can't wait for the next movie too!
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Really like the Twilight series and was glad to get this installment.  It was another good one.  Can hardly wait for more to come.
B0063IH60K|4.0|HAve fun with this game. Play this one all the time.  Who would not like solitaire?  It's a happy game
1451695195|5.0|I picked up that book and could not put it down--I am not a doctor, just an ordinary human being and was really surprised how he put it in layman's terms .Unbelievable book--If that is his first book, he certainly did a remarkable job.<br /><br />After my husband died, I had some unusual things happen. I know there are higher forms of life. Never questioned that...
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This is a great backpack. I have bought other backpacks and was not happy with them but this Ibex one is the best because it has so many pockets. I have a thing for pockets and this totally helps. I can keep everything separate from each other instead of having to pile everything in the 2 pockets backpacks give me. I travel a lot and have been using this for a while now and it has no problem very durable. I would buy this product again.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Had heard alot about this movie and was not disappointed.  Got copies for my son and son-in-law as well.  Great family movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is SO fun!I love it! It's really addicting! My cousin ALWAYS asks me if he can play it! We both love it!
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|very dissapointing-not funny AT ALL-was very surprised-always enjoy Meryl Streep-this time -nada-we all enjoy a funny movie-so just an opinion
0345410025|4.0|It does what it says it does. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their memory. I've a grouse though, some of the concepts gets too technical at times and makes me go 'huh?' but all in all an excellent memory guide book!
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Taylor KItsch and that beautiful dreds dude in a 3-way relationship with a free 'n easy, sun-baked blonde...with heat and high action swirling around the darker side of marijuana commerce. Kept my blood moving!
B0061QD88S|1.0|When I got the DVD it didn't have a case. And its looks as if it is a copy. Also it freezes in spots and skips a lot towards the end .
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is just a crazy game.  It is frustrating and fun all at the same time.  It is just crazy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love all aspects wish they would update the devotionals more often and give more options. Also explain how to connect with others.
1592407889|3.0|When I began the book I really wanted to root for Sachi.  The first fifty pages or so I thought this woman is very hurt and angry, and a little passive aggressive, no one was spared.  I did and do feel for her and hope she can find a way to forgive her parents.  If I coul truly articulate that concept I'd write my own book!  Unfortunately you can't find peace or clarity till you do.<br /><br />Now for the parts that made me scratch my head.  Her stories about herself, largely apart from her parents seemed really implausible, which sort cast a shadow on the rest.  For example sneaking out of boarding school to skinny dip in a frozen lake, huh? Really?  And then the story of the hooker with the heart of gold who took her back to her hotel and stroked her hair until she fell asleep while her friend remained sound asleep in the next bed.  Then she attempts to present herself as a hapless naïf, drinking Shirley temples at the age of 17 in 1974. I know that sounds stupid but it bugged me.  She is a few years o,der than I but I would consider us contemporaries.  I too had a difficult narcissistic mother and attended boarding school, and I haven't had a Shirley temple since I was eight.<br /><br />All in all, I do think ms MacLaine shoul have paid for college for heaven's sake and been more involved in her life and let's face it her upbringing was no bed of roses.  If you need no other proof, think about it, hOw else do you become a little crazy and so full of resentment.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book and perhaps find some common experiences.  Instead I found the authors voice a little inauthentic.  Less a fun read than a puzzling one.
1932735410|5.0|I wouldn't necessarily rely on this book alone to prepare for the exam, however I would not prepare for it without this being in the arsenal of prep material.  Highly recommended as a must read for anyone going for the PMP!
B0063IH60K|5.0|The is a great version of the game.  I really like it as well as the other versions that I have.
B00969PR18|5.0|It was very useful, I can't wait to use it on vacation.  With this map I'll be able to find my way home
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|No matter what they do, Train does it best! I love their music and California themes. Having lived in San Francisco at the end of the sixties and through all the seventies, I hold SF near and dear in my heart. Train has a way of bringing back all the good memories!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I simply loved it,recommend this book to all book lovers. It very enchanting n enthralling,wonderfully written<br />Wonderful n very educational
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing this game.  It is easy to play.  I love this version as well as the other versions I have.
B009JBZH54|5.0|He loved it! It came with a booklet, all the movies in HD. It was a great gift for Christmas and is a great trilogy to watch!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I won't go on at length, what could I say. The most compelling thing I've read in years and years. Literally could not put it down and ended up staying up all night to finish, then went and bought the rest of the series and kept going.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|If starting a business was easy, everybody would do it.  This book should be required reading for all business majors!
B009A7E7SK|2.0|I didn't like this app at all! Not worth downloading ... in my opinion ... I think it can be better or take it off even though its free.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I previously bought this at Wal-Mart. It looks fantastic on a good LED TV. I would purchase this again- awesome movie-great Blue-ray
0446580848|2.0|I have read all of Mr. DeMille's novels and always look forward to his next one. His last one, The Lion\\" was not his best , but when I saw 'The Panther' it was time for celebration. And to boot, it is over 600 pages (I love a thick novel). But now my opinion is 'put this animal on a diet'. The first impression was that this premise is a little hard to believe, no US citizen would be used as bait as described. But what the heck, could be interesting. Then we get to Yemen, and it really starts to drag. Got impatient with the travelogue through Sana'a and all the characters that had to be re-introduced time after time. The killer to me was the plan to nab The Panther. Not just a few pages description, but chapter after chapter of detail after detail, and dialog in detail. And the plan is just too bizarre, what is the term--suspension of belief. So I flipped to the end to see how it all panned out, and  told ya' just as I thought, but you'll just have to read it for yourself.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story is a believable mystery about a DA's son who is accused of murdering a classmate. There is a lot to ponder regarding ethics, parenting, nature vs. nurture, etc. This would make a very good choice for book clubs.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I thought it was an ok read.  I felt it left a lot unsaid and had some questions still rolling around in my head.
B006TTC5JK|5.0|I have always been a big Jimmy Stewart fan and have seen and enjoyed all of his movies. The Hitchcock movies, the westerns, Bell, Book & Candle are all great movies but Harvey always stands out as a great one. Glad it's now on Blu-ray at an affordable price.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|love the whole album<br />from intro to the ending<br />Robert Glasper as struck a cord in the music business<br />look forward to more music from him in the future
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a great CD. Although I don't care for tracks 4, 5, or 6, I really like the others. They do a really good version of The Boxer, too. Love the banjo!
1400049628|5.0|Hubby and kids are huge fans of Walking Dead, and this made an awesome Christmas gift! He loved it! :)
B009KHCT94|2.0|Cover looked good, description sounded good, movie was barely OK and sometimes hard to watch. Not a bad premise but could have been much better. Glad I only rented it. The whole idea of Nazi's colonizing the dark side of the moon waiting for an opportunity to invade earth to take over after losing WW2 is hard to swallow, even if you are good at suspending reality and getting into imagination.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|I discovered Gregory Porter by chance..and let me tell you I feel like I found a diamond covered in sand...his music is full of soul and love...I truley enjoy listening to his music.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I only like a few tracks on this CD...you wold be better off listening to each track and downloading only the ones you like. Babel, however, is awesome and well worth buying the whole CD.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|Loved that we could pay for a single episode, but wish we could put it on a DVD to watch without internet connection. But we cannot.
B002M9WW30|5.0|If you enjoy(ed) the Rocky movies you can't go wrong with this box set. 6 full length movies on Blu-ray with extras for a super low price.
B0000C23DO|5.0|What can I say, my wife is a big fan. She was wondering if I could move her cassette tapes to CD for her but I felt like this was a mush better option. And now that I have heard some of this on CD, I kind of like a lot of it myself.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I am a big fan of Vince Flynns' books.His knowledge of the world brings his book to life as I read it.Great book! LOVE IT!!!
B0017QSZW6|5.0|Great detail of Henry VIII's relationship with Anne Boleyn and the political and religious issues that arose because of it. Also great costume and set.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you are just finding out about Downton Abbey and missed all or part of the first two seasons, then this set of season 1 & 2 is the way to go. Inexpensive with nice extras and shown in it's original UK format meaning some episodes are 1 hour long and some two hours. When shown here on PBS the longer episodes get broken up into smaller episodes and room made for commercials. This is how they were originally broadcast. Season 3 is now being shown on PBS in it's chopped up versions but you can buy Season 3 on DVD in the original format just like the seasons in this set.
B00007LTIL|5.0|My wife was very happy with this. She has cassettes but hasn't listened to those in years because we have no cassette player.
B007PFD90G|5.0|This is the first book of Rushdie's I've read and I find him to be a writer of extralordinary talent.  His is an interesting and compelling story butI did not find this a quick read; it's slow going for me.  I most definitely recommend this book.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|Clever romantic comedy with male and female leading roles exhibiting a chemistry reflecting casual sexual attraction  developing into a mature affection for each other.
B000LXH0AY|5.0|Always have loved this play and other version of the movie.  Would highly recommend to all who like Broadway musicals.
B007712XAU|5.0|have the whole series - great show
030758836X|5.0|From the beginning I did to want to stop reading this book, too bad my daily life got in my way!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I got a total kick out of this movie. It's upbeat with corny humor.  Really funny- the throwing up girl.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|Dear Life<br />This is about dreary, narcissistic characters with dull lives and questionable ethics.  Had to struggle to care about them or their stories.
B0058DRSHW|5.0|good to greate. lol this book is a great one, and looks greate on the kindle keyboard and paperwhite ds
0385344228|5.0|A friend recommended this book so I was anxious to read it. From the beginning I was hooked. William Landay spins a great story right up to the end. Boy was I surprised!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I feel that Captain Hook, the Mad Hatter, and Rumpelstiltskin completely steal the show every time they are in it... But even if you are watching it for other reasons, you'll probably love it. Kids can definitely watch this - there's really nothing too dirty or graphic, nothing I'd feel uncomfortable letting them watch. It's well directed, written, filmed... Yep. Good show!
B001FB4W0C|1.0|I payed about $20 for this and when i open the package I had taken it out of the box and the case is falling apart both of the divider things that hold the disks is not attached the latches on it is broken and i don't know about other people but i want my DVDS to stay all together and be able to close the case. So I am not happy with what i saw for $20.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|good to greate. lol this book is a great one, and looks greate on the kindle keyboard and paperwhite ds
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I just loved this book.  It was hard to put down although there were times when I just had to put it down and digest all that had happened.
B00B0NF4L6|5.0|Great new band, love these guys. Check these guys out. It's refreshing to see a new band who is not afraid ot plug into an amp and lose the acoustic-folk sound.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I'm a 52 year old kid... this on Blu Ray is both great sound and of course NEMO and the turtle dude.
B005BO4OY8|5.0|Very interesting movie get comfortable in your seat and take it in. Superb acting by the lead actors and would recommend to all
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I liked the story and the twist ending. Main character is very easy to root for. I recommend to any one needing a theological punch on the shoulder.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, but this movie was funny. All his friends were in it and they were funny as well. I was very happy with this purchase
B005LAIHZY|2.0|Not real impressed, movie is dark (like in, needs to be seen in the theater) we have a 72&#34; TV and had all the lights out but the movie just was too dark and not a really well thought out story.<br /><br />Graphics are pretty good, the ones that can be seen
B006NXIO7O|3.0|Great action movie and the acting was good. Zoe Saldana performed magnificently, the movie thrilled like any other action movie and she got you on her side getting back at the people who murdered her family when she was a child. Not a movie I thought I would watch over and over...
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The film was true to the book, but somehow lacked the emotions and intrigue of the book. The dvd we received has a skip in it, though it did play back after hitting reverse.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Nice to have the same white matching &#34;Amazon&#34; cord that was original to the plug and Kindle Fire.  Perfect fit if you have lost or misplaced the cord and have only the wall plug-in.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this on a review online, it is one of the BEST disks that I have heard in a long time. I'm 52 and my taste runs from Mowtown, Stevie Ray Vaugh to pop, jazz and even a little country. I'm glad my car has a hard disk drive so I can cue this disk up anytime.<br /><br />BUY IT NOW
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|This is one of Woody Allen's best written movies! The. Cast did a particularly stupendous job in this movie, I can watch the movie over and over and probably never tire seeing it!
0345803507|5.0|Wonderful love story in addition to the detailed sex scenes.  The romance found underlying is very romantic.  You can truly get lost in the series.
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I  read this book in high school as required reading.  Even though I had to struggle through some of the archaic language I remember loving it. Seeing it as a free download intrigued me to read it once again and loved it even more.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This was an excellent game. It had excellent. graphics and an intriguing storyline. I would recommend this game to any of my friends.
B004R36QUE|5.0|This movie is a well written and the lead actors are simply the best! I have seen this movie possibly six or seven times and highly recommend it to anyone!
B000KK0AKU|2.0|The movie did not move with interest for me. I did not finish it. The title 91/2 Weeks  was boring. 91/2 Weeks is the title.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|this movie is really good<br /><br />The vender even got it to me earlier than the expected so it was AWESOME<br />I would do business with this vender again in the future
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am not a big fan of AB but this is a good APP if you are into it.  Great color and works well on my Kindle Fire.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|Michelle Williams totally embraced the role of Marilyn Monroe and give the best performance I have seen! You literally could not take your eyes off of her. The cast was impeccable the story itself gave to life many things I never new of this wonderful person!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|58 years old, watched a bit too much TV, in my time but this is enjoyable every time T watch this. I own all six seasons
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|The game is very fun and cool it has amazing graphics and is defiantly worth the 1.29 I got really scared when the the phone booth started talking then a couple seconds later slender man's tentacles are killing me this is not one of those scams this is a great deal I recommend anybody to buy this :D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like the game. its kind of fun. I like horses so it is my style of a game. lol
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Good dictionary it really helped me especially since I'm taking courses in college. It has every word i need to see the definition for

B004EBT5CU|5.0|She's has one of the greatest voices I've ever heard and this cd is exceptional.  EVERY SONG is great and she sings her heart out!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It would be nice if it was a bit larger. I have had the game for awhile now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The game is easy to play and addicting. There is no charge and no pressure to open an account. It will come in handy when I am traveling and away from WiFi.
B000FIMG68|5.0|58 years old, watched a bit too much TV, in my time but this is enjoyable every time I watch this. I own all six seasons
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Love this cd and love Phillip Phillips.  All the songs are great, including a live performance of &#34;Home&#34; and a remake of &#34;Wicked Game&#34;.  I can't stop listening to it.  Best singer to ever come from American Idol.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game. It was the very first game I downloaded. I find myself playing every chance I get. Best thing is I can play on long car rides and many other things. Time flies when playing this game.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|This was the best gift that I have bought this year.  It not only came on a very timely basis.  The DVD collection is great it not only has all the episodes but has gag reels and interviews with the stars.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I like the different searches like find all of one object or find the dif between two rooms and others. It is a fun and enjoyable game.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|If you're in the mood for a good edge-of-your-seat action flick, then Taken is for you. So long as you realize up front that it's relatively mindless, you won't be let down.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This needs to offer more chances to earn what is needed to get more cards. The coins to buy cards go to fast but other than that i love this game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first time I played the game, I felt like I was on a roller coaster...I love roller coasters!!!! Love it
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Probably my favorite all-time fantasy series.  So, I may be biased.  However, Red Country is so perfect in so many ways that I simply have to say that this book and Best Served Cold are probably my two favorite books in the entire series.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away.  This story is so tightly written and perfectly paced.  I would compare it with &#34;Unforgiven&#34; in the way that we, as readers, can see how a man who has given up war and bloodshed (an old friend, by the way..) is slowly drawn back in to his former life.  It is exciting, and chilling and as tragic as anything in the series before.<br /><br />Have fun with this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is such a good app.It is way better then temple run 1.It has these cool life gems too.When you die,you can use a life gem and continue your run!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Liked it very much. Grisham hasn't lost his touch..I fouind myself  liking his character even tho he is a &#34;racketeer!
B003YL4L0W|5.0|As always, Jodi Picoult offered characters that were real people with believable storylines that kept me interested and made me wish that the book had a part 2!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Really, a thrilling and sometimes humorous tale of survival.  This book does a good job of immersing the reader in a world where one problem, one mistake, could leave the protagonist without any options and dead or dying alone and far from home.  Our protagonist is well-written and tends to deal with problems through levity and humor.  I have to admit, the humor was sometimes a bit much for me and pulled me out of the story.  However, the author does a good job with the minute scientific details (and they all seem pretty accurate) and he was almost immediately able to pull me back in.  Well done, and well-written.  I would definately recommend this book to a friend.
B009VB97EY|5.0|Gotta love Chatum Tanning and the hot male bods, but would have loved to see more.  A fun movie to watch with the girls.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was O.K. Not up to DeMille's  better books.What kept me going is his  sarcastic New York humor.Needed more story.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Maroon 5 just keep getting better.  I love every track on this one!  It is very upbeat in tempo, which is what I like.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan, lets just get that out of the way.  However, I think I judge his work very objectively and like anyone with a body of work as vast as Mr. King's, he has his ups and downs.<br /><br />This, Constant Readers, is what I consider the pinnacle of his work to date.  A very King-esque mixture of terror and nostalgia that reminds me how King is able to make his characters feel so human, and by doing so create the attachement that immerses readers in the story and makes the scary stuff work so well.  When I think of this book, I always feel the connection with the kids and their childhood, and the loss of that childhood through the events of the story makes me remember the end of my own childhood and makes me think of how diffucult the transition can be (although, not as difficult as it was for the kids in the book...hopefully).
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy playing Mahjong but I have not gotten use to playing it on my Kindle. The tiles are a little too small for me but I haven't tried to change any settings yet.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was very different and enjoyable.Quite an  interesting plot..Thought the book to be better than the movie.Did not read the sequel as yet
B005IQZB14|5.0|Redemptive true story of a girl who finds answers to life questions while hiking the Pacific Crest. I'm not an outdoorsy type but thoroughly enjoyed this read.
B00915G6MG|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE SHOW EVER. I LOVE THIS SHOW SO MUCH THAT I HAVE 2 COMPLETE SETS OF EACH 1-9 SO FAR, AND PRE-ORDERED SEASON 10. THIS SHOW NEVER LETS YOU DOWN. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING THAT YOU REALLY DON'T EXSPECT.THIS SHOW HAS CONTINUED TO BE SUPER BECAUSE IT SHOWS THEM IN A DIFFERENT VEIW THEN OTHER SHOWS. THEIR LIKE FAMILY AND YOU NEVER QUITE HOW WHAT EACH PERSON I IS GOING TO INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. I REALLY CAN NOT SEE AN ENDING TO THIS SHOW, WITH THE GREAT WRITTERS COMING UP WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS AS THEY DO. CONGRADULATIONS TO EVERYONE AND KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK.<br /><br />  MURIEL
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|I like the voice feature. I am always trying to learn new words and I enjoy hearing them spoken as I learn them.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|of ALL TIME. The Bootleg Cut is a little pricey, but totally worth it. This movie is hilarious, heartwarming, nostalgic, and stylish. And everyone loves music.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This novel takes you inside a mysterious circus that shows up in random places and the characters that are involved in the circus and those who follow it as it moves from place to place. Very imaginative!
0802130208|2.0|First things first. Unlike other readers I do not abhor this book, but neither do I think it's the masterful satiric comedy almost everybody thinks is, including the Pulitzer comitee (I found myself smiling a lot throughout the book, but It didn't manage to make me raise a single laughter). Also, unlike other readers, I never start a book expecting to \\"relate\\" to the characters, plot or story, I'm quite comfortable with obnoxious, unpleasant, exaggerated, overtly egocentric, misanthropic, homophobic and mysoginous characters, and I'm quite comfortable also with shallow and trivial plots as long as there is great writing behind and a sense of purpose to the book.<br /><br />And that is exactly my biggest issue with the book, I felt JKT writing to be somewhat amateurish, like the author tries too hard to be ironic or sardonic, or hilarious, or imaginative, or shocking or even purposely disgusting, but in the end it gives you nothing and you are left with nothing from the read.<br /><br />I totally understand the novel is written in a way to match a satire or farse, even absurdist play, perhaps to mimic Ignatius Reilly obsessions with medieval literature; but in the end it leans a lot less towards Shakespeare, Cervantes and Chaucer and a lot more towards South Park and Family Guy (I'm in no way a big fan of purposely-moronic in-your-face situational humor).<br /><br />I really believe this would have been a good start for a promising author and we will never know how he would have evolved, but as far as this book goes, I don't see where all the reverence comes from.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is one of the best games ive played. very easy to control where you go. no freezing or anything. MUST GET!!!!!!! i promise u, this is one of the best games u can get on here, and its F-R-E-E!!!!!!!!! works 4 any device!<br />P.S. this is even better than temple run 2!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this game. She has wanted to play it non-stop sense we downloaded it. I recommend it for everyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this fictional trilogy at the recommendation of my sister-in-law, an elementary and middle school librarian. I was completely taken in by the story and read the three books in a short time. Although written for a younger audience, I found these books both interesting and compelling.
B00000ICD9|4.0|You probably need to be someone who can handle your emotional state of mind to keep it together while watching this one...<br /><br />What Dreams May Come is a really emotional love story... but not right away.  Quite the opposite in the beginning.  This part is about Robin Williams first losing his kids in a car accident, then losing himself in a separate car accident, and finally losing his wife to suicide.  Now that's what I call the ultimate depressing storyline!  However, it's not *entirely* devoted to sadness (hence the \\"love story\\" part).<br /><br />What happens is that Robin Williams eventually arrives in what appears to be either someone's imagination with painted backgrounds, or heaven itself.  Robin Williams is easily the star of this movie and receives the most attention.  For a little while, Robin Williams appears to be here alone and finds himself exploring the curiosities of this unexplainable and high imaginative world, but soon he meets up with his deceased dog now as a younger pup, and another man (and later on, a shrink with important knowledge concerning people's fate).  We then learn Robin is actually in heaven and the paintings are part of his wifes drawings.  Interesting stuff.<br /><br />As a viewer, you'll be totally caught up in the beautifully created backgrounds.  Nothing like I've ever seen in a movie, that's for sure.  The one segment with a bird flying above and soaring through painted skies is a highlight.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie isn't without a few minor flaws.  For one thing, I'm not crazy about the belief that those who commit suicide go somewhere else.  I don't believe this personally- that's why I don't like it.  However that's not the reason I'm lowering the overall rating to 4-stars.  It wouldn't be fair to lower the rating based on personal beliefs anyway.  It's how the beauty and adventure of the heavenly state we experience in the first half is exchanged for a slow-moving emotional journey to find Robin's wife inthe second half.  A good chunk of this is, I'm afraid, quite boring (due to so many romantic and meaningful flashbacks between Robin and his wife).  But I suppose a second viewing might change my mind.<br /><br />The ending is amazing though.  About the best way to wrap up these events.  Overall, a really well-made movie with a unique spin on the afterlife.  I'm warning you though- it CAN get really emotional on a few occasions, and if you're easily bored you've been warned about the second half.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wonderful book that will have you squirming on every page. The only gripe I have is the plot is very much like Twilight.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is like Mario and is the best game I ever played. y y y y y y y?  because
B007THA4FI|4.0|All these folks needed were a few wizards around to straighten out their entirely too messy, ordinary and banal muggle existences. Rowlings told a great story and actually made implausible Brits believable to this Yank.
B0091QS88K|4.0|Prompts for review b4 ever getting to play. Interface a little klunky hard to nabigate specially for kid. Fun gam if you can get past the kinks.
B005NFW0U0|4.0|if you watch the vampire diaries, you will like this episode. they are all good. this one is just a means to the next
B005HMHPGI|4.0|I really was pleased with the product except the box was crushed and to me the box was part of the package and had a picture of a Christmas tree.  Otherwise, everything was fine and I am enjoying the movie and the bell.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|Great Writing and well played by all characters.  This is very entertaining from beginning to end, with a great score to boot.
B000FC12C8|4.0|This is a good book for investors, but personally expected more from the author. In my opinion this book is good for newbies.
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|I love this!  I have purchased many headsets for my iPhone, and have always had complaints from people I'm speaking with that they can't hear me or it crackles.  I have had no complaints and people are able to hear me loud and clear.  They can be used with any standard headphones which is another nice feature.  The only complaint I would have about this is I have found wire management to be difficult, but I think I have figured it out.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|this is heavy handed and preachy. it could have been on lifetime. after the crash who cares what happens to these characters.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I enjoyed it more than the 2nd one, but still not as good as the first. I recommend checking it out.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Start was good then it became Quite eventful but then predictable !!!Was expecting more to turn around , but its ok !!!
B000002J6H|5.0|Great album, if you are a CSNY fan, this is a must have for your collection, Stephen as always is a great song writer
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|The voices alone are music to my ears, and even though I don't understand most of the words, it is a pleasure to simply listen to the album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the second and the third of the trilogy. I enjoyed learning more about each of the characters as things went along. Yes there is alot of graphic sex throughout all three books but for me their story took over all of that, it just added to it.
B0093OGBL6|3.0|Interesting book, very informative, but not well written. It repeats the same thing too often. I felt as though I was re-reading whole paragraphs at times. Could be much shorter!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|All 3 movies are made for the big screen and a big surround sound system, it was just like being in the theatre.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Total Doctor Who fans! Awesome replica! Great gift! Plastic is a little thin, but it is a toy after all...
B0086700CM|4.0|Well,you done did it now! This app keeps my heart rate up. I find it a real challange to see how far I can get before I become frantic and loose my cool. Better than Pac-Man!!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Truly a great product. This is a very sturdy stand that fits 75mm x 75mm or 100mm x 100mm standard mounts and comes with the necessary parts for both mounting sizes. I used it with my Dell P2412H and it has held up nicely, even though the specs only list up to a 22&#34; monitor size. Only complaint is the required depth for the table clamp, if you have a desk with a front apron/perpendicular side 2-3 inches from the edge of the desk, this probably won't work for you, since the clamp needs at least 3-4 inches depth to get a good stable bite on the table top.<br /><br />Overall a great product, as it adjusts every which way to fit you.
1781161313|5.0|I was very surprised when I received this manual. I thought maybe this was a small book with limited detail and I was wrong. This is a larger book and is written much like an actual army/marine field manual used in the armed forces minus the sci fi elements from the film. There is so much detail from things like weapons to bio suits to hyper drives and is full of diagrams and images. I high recommend this book to any fan of the Aliens franchise as it really gives you a good background as to the purpose of the colonial marines and enhances the events of Aliens.
B008NW67E0|2.0|This was disappointing.  I was really looking forward to the group's CD, given their success with &#34;I Will Wait.&#34;  But I should have waited and listened to samples before buying the album.  Their songs all sound the same and use the same formula:  a gravelly voice that is part-time troubador and the rest of the time screaming maniac; fast strumming on the banjo; dramatic pauses; clamorous resumes.  Perhaps I exaggerate.  There might be two different songs here.  But it is too tedious to find the second one.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|I guess you can tell by the title that I'm not that young. I don't have a clue what this is all about.It's not relevant to anything I do!
0553801473|5.0|Excellent book. My only complaint is that it ended. Can't wait for the rest of the series, get writing please!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Am not able to write a review for the books as I haven't read them yet.<br />Love the Canadian Tenors.....can't go wrong purchasing their c.d.'s<br />Leonard Cohen is superb.  Love his music.
B001CDLAT4|5.0|No words, just unusual seldom-seen images.  I rarely watch anything more than once, but this I keep coming back to.  The images provoke deep contemplation.  I love this film.  Would love to talk with the photographers.
B007BT0RKG|2.0|I live in Sonora and there are only like four paved roads, it would be nice if it showed them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read yet. It was suspenseful from the beginning to end.  I can't wait to read more of Suzanne's books. I recommended The Hunger Games to my boyfriend, relatives, all of my friends and most my coworkers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I can't wait to watch the next episode. We already bought season 3, a must watch for everyone. Love it
B000OVLINI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this. I did figure out who the mysterious figure actually was before it was explained in the book but still enjoyed reading.  There were lots of thought provoking statements made by one character in particular.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I didnt watch this back in what 2002 when it was new. I did watch Serenity and liked it a lot. I decided to check out Firefly after that and I was not disappointed. Great show, wish it was still around.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love games like this.  They tend to promote logical thinking and process thinking without the feeling that we are being tutored or schooled.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This film is a critical Bond film that sets the stage for 50 more years of Bond. There is a surprise at every turn. Someone thought critically about the plot of this movie and made all the right moves. I can understand why some would be upset about this movie's storyline, but everything happened for a reason. Skyfall is one of my favorite Bond films EVER . Not to be missed if you are a Bond lover.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|best movie ever made. the best romantic film ever. It makes you cry everytime you watch it. you gain different perspectives each time you watch it.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Love and have loved this movie for years.  A great purchase. (P.S. I just love David Bowie in this movie.)
0061537969|4.0|This book was one of the most touching I've read in a long time. I think that if you initially looked at the cover and assumed it was mostly targeted at dog lovers or even animal lovers in general, you should rethink your impression and give it a try. You'll be hooked, (and probably crying) in the first twenty pages.<br /><br />Denny's incredible dog Enzo is convinced by a television documentary that he is going to reincarnate as a human being after he dies. He feels that once his soul has learned everything it needs to learn in this life, he will know it's time to go. Enzo survives alongside his master, Denny, through many hardships and devastating tragedy. Through a powerful unspoken force of some kind, Enzo is able to support Denny and encourage him in those moments where he very nearly succumbs to the tragic events that have happened to him. The Art of Racing in the Rain is a valuable story full of truths and positive ways to deal with life in both the high times and the lowest. The book is infused with hope like a hand reaching down into the mud where you thought you could never escape from life. You will fall in love with Enzo, and maybe just learn to live life with the mindset that both accepts personal responsibility and remains open to the support and answers that come from strange and unexpected places. A great read!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Un libro mas de Nicholas Sparks que me conmueve el alma. Definitivamente es un excelente escritor. Recomiendo este y todos sus libros al 100%
B004LWZWGK|5.0|this movie was the best. it rocked!!! I thought it completed the trilogy all the way. check it out. yes
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show. I love how they show step by step how he figures it out (when he's not saying it).
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game really requires some elusive strategy that will certainly reveal itself in the next game--or so I hope as I spend hours clicking on little icons to match pairs.  It's addictive and mentally stimulating, but the real draw is in trying to psyche out the best way to beat the odds of random arrangement of the tiles so that you maximize your score.  Not there yet!<br /><br />It would be perfect if the story of the Quest had more chapters.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Of all the Marvel movies, this is by far the best. X-men lost it by the third movie, but this captures the spirit of the Avengers. Joss Whedon was born to be an Avenger. The writing is crisp and the action doesn't drag. And even though Iron Man is the 'leader', you know Captain America is the heart. The movie still feels fresh after my 6th viewing.
B0081336FO|5.0|Season 2 was even better than 1 if you can believe it. LOve the show. I can't wait for next season to be released.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Loved the book.  Decided to start reading Jack Reacher  novels after  seeing the film.  Looking forward to reading the next one!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Not sure why I am so fascinated by this but I just keep playing on and on!  Nice app, no issues.
B009X01D9U|5.0|I love this case. I had previously ordered the CaseCrown Ridge Standby Case (Red) for Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8.9 Inch and am NOT a fan. This case, however, is slim, compact, has all the features of the Case Crown but better functionality. I find the swivel function easy to use, and no issues with standing the Fire in either landscape or portrait orientation. The auto-on feature when opening the device works perfectly. Since the swivel feature works so easily, it doesn't bother me in the least that if you want to plug it in while closed you have to swivel the Fire (if you had the camera on the top while open). I also love the variety of colors available. What can I say, I like bright colors!<br /><br />Love it, worth every penny - honestly I tried the cheaper case and it just turned out to be a waste of time and money, should have purchased this one right off the bat.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Adults may find this movie as some pretentious teen/kid movie. And if you think that, then I feel sorry for you; if all young adult (YA)/teen movies were this great, I'd be respecting the genre a lot more.  Writer/director Stephen Chbosky's coming-of-age film perfectly captures the teen angst and solitude that comes with being a teenage introvert; it should be noted that while there is angst, awkwardness and solitude in this film, there is also laughs, heart and, most of all, hope. Although romantic love does have its prominent place in this film, it is a universal love that exudes from the story. And do not let that deter you from this wonderful film! I have to admit that seeing protagonist Logan Lerman's Charlie's beginning moments of the film, I couldn't help but think \\"I WAS that kid!\\" (thankfully, though, I did not have his issue, which is a major plot point) -- the awkwardness, the quiet, the not-fitting-in, no friends, and the importance, passion and art of making mixed tapes! Fortunately, like Charlie, I found a great group of friends in my latter years of high school (and just like Charlie & his friends, we too were big [[ASIN:B00004U8P9 The Rocky Horror Picture Show (25th Anniversary Edition)]] fans)! The performances are stunning by the entire talented cast; Emma Watson has especially proved her mettle here, and Ezra Miller has amazing screen presence! This was one of my absolute favorites of the year! I can't say enough about this film other than watch it!
0345525558|5.0|This book is a really good book. The story is so engaging, you cannot put it down. Loved it, loved it.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I liked it, but, is the info up-to-date?  I think it needs some sort of indicator.  Some of the problems I had was in the size of the front page graphic - How many Mb's can it be? or is there a limit?.  Also, it contradicts some of the info shown in the youtube videos.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play solitaire every once in a while.  I got this game because it fits the bill.  When I travel, I used to have a deck of cards with me.  Now, I bring my kindle fire.  It is good to have a variety of games to play and I always spend a little time with this one.
B0007P0LPC|5.0|Have always loved this music, and have seen the Ballet many times. Beautiful relaxing<br />music! What grace and fluidity in motion.
0525478817|5.0|I write very few reviews but this book deserves every five star review and then some.  I found it to be a beautiful story.  When so much of what we read, hear, see, and watch is extravagent and looking to top the thing before it, this book finds brilliance in simplicity.  This story is anything but extravagent and is a story of characters, life, raw emotion, and love. Although I state simplicity, there is a great deal to analyze and discuss through the layers of complexity in this novel.  John Green, not only makes you ache for these characters, but he makes you miss them when the book is over and they are no longer a part of your life.  I hope that the acclaim this book is receiving continues and opens our eyes to the true artistry of writing.  Our world needs more art and culture like this novel.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Wonderful story line, it was full of fantasy, mystery and action.  Very good read.  Check out her other books too.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A quick game for all ages.  There are many boards that get progressively difficult, though I have found the first several levels are quite easy.  This is a another game that unlocks successive levels, but some of which are at an additional fee.  Though I like the game, I haven't decided if I will purchase additional levels yet.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I usually am very hostile towards those who \\"hate\\" movies I love... but I can understand why some would be turned off by \\"Flight.\\" It's NOT about a plane crash. It's an incredible scene, that many of those who disliked the film give it's due credit in their critical reviews... but it's just a part of what the film is about. The film is about a \\"functioning junkie\\" who when given the chance to save himself... chooses instead to throw his body on a grenade. What a glorious feeling it is to KNOW you had the courage to do the right thing even though it means you'll get punished for it. I respect that the intense substance abuse may not be for everyone, but for those who appreciate extraordinary classic film-storytelling, Zemeckis stands with Scorsese and Fincher as an American Da Vinci-level talent. Thank you Bob.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|Good looking, reliable, and...automatic! For the price, meaning very affordable, more folks can get a hold of a great watch.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|It made me laugh and cry.  I admired the actors way of looking at life and his sense of humor in spite of his circumstances.<br />Wonderful movie to get lost in.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game reminds me of the days I spent at the shore in the arcade in my youth.  I really enjoyed this game when it first came out and spent many quarters to see how far I was able to get.  I am thinking about buying the expanded version so that I can play all the game boards.  I think this is a great game for every age.
0321885112|5.0|I used to draw endlessly as a kid. It's so good to read this book and be reminded why I love to draw/sketch. Now I can put the techniques into play when I am learning something from attending Conferences like New Media Expo or watching a TED video.<br /><br />Mike takes you by the hand and show you that anyone can use this process to remember anything much better.<br /><br />This book will also serve as a reference for me should I ever need more inspiration.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|The series is well produced. The acting is solid and believable. So, my lack of interest must come from the writers. I just could not bring myself to care what was going on.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun app! I love to take care of my horse! It feels like I'm actually taking care of a horse!
B004U52VPS|2.0|Its not very difficult to set up but it obviously must be on a flat stable surface. We played through it once and were bored with it. Great for younger kids I suppose.
B003ASLJK4|4.0|Besides being a good movie, this item arrived as described, new never opened. I didn't not see this movie in theaters but had heard good things about it. I saw it on Amazon for a great price, so I bought a good movie at a great price.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|When you get through the dated language and examples this book has great pearls of wisdom to give the reader.  Great old book to read and then move on to:<br /><br /> The Genie Within: Your Subconcious Mind--How It Works and How to Use It [Paperback]<br />Harry W Carpenter
B007C12RDS|5.0|Great story line.  Also, like the time line.  Can not wait to see the rest of the season!!!  Good to watch
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love all the info this little battery ap can give you and it looks pretty awesome as well :)
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Cute game and pretty addictive.  My 5 year old loves it and I must admit that I can get pretty caught up in running the little cafe as well.  It's biggest fault is that you're trapped in the same setting except for the ability to add a few chairs and tables.  Despite that, it would get another star from me if you could do more without spending real money.  You earn pretend money by running the cafe but you can't use it for everything, no matter how much you earn.  Even my 5 year old gets frustrated at not being able to get the new characters she wants after working so hard to get cafe dollars.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|When I noticed I could watch this for free from amazon prime I thought why not? I'd heard of the show but had yet to see even one episode. In the spirit of total honesty, I LOVED IT! Some episodes go from laugh out loud to almost tear-jerking. I've lost count how many times I have rewatched my favorite musical numbers! I recently started season 2 so we'll see if that one surpasses!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Very fun game. Super addictive. Check it daily and its really fun to unlock new animals. The cross breeds are brilliant. Lol
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I am going to admit that I love the 3 Jurassic Park movies..yes even the third one. So of course I would buy this! But the extras are awesome and I watched every minute of them!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It's a lot like the cafe game on Facebook without all the annoying posts. I am a bit worried about becoming addicted to it!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Everyone enjoyed this film.  Cute story and characters, with fun, upbeat music.  Our audience consisted of adults and children from ages 5-14.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|nothing great about this movie nothing great about this movie nothing great about this movie  nothing great about this movienothing great about this movie ????????
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Sara Shepard writes great novels!  I'm hooked on the TV show and that's how I got started on the books.  She keeps the reader interested & it's an easy read.  I'm almost 30 and I should probably be reading more sophisticated books, not teeny bopper stories, but I love PLL!!  She always keeps the reader intrigued as to what will happen next.
B005LAII80|5.0|Received my DVD on time and with no problems, excellent picture and sound quality for the movie, watch just the Bluray version first but will watch the 3D version at another time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Enjoyed  the book much more than the movie for a number of reasons.  Can't wait to start the next book before watching the movie.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|Received the DVD's as expected, well packaged and always no problems with the delervery of the series, all discs were very well packaged, the picture and sound were excellent.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|The quality of the image is great. The set came packed properly and I was quite satisfied with this buying.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars is popular in my house. Just as described. Good price. My daughter enjoyed for a Christmas gift. I like it too.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Wow. I just loved this book - I haven't a single criticism and there are only a very small handful of novels I can say that about.<br />The Rosie Project made me smile, made me laugh, made me cry and really made me think. The writing is just so brilliant and the characters so compelling. Intelligent, witty, warm writing. I cannot stop raving about this novel.<br />The problem now, is how long will I have to wait for another Graeme Simsion book? Encore!
B005LAII3U|5.0|Received DVD on date requested, excellent packaging. DVD has two versions one theater and one Director's cut, both about the same story, both had excellent sound and picture quality.
B0093LE3BO|5.0|I have ordered this pack because the last season was the only thing missing in my collection. It came well packed and protected.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Well liked by my 6 yr old niece as well as my 71 yr old father. We all watched it and loved it!

030758836X|4.0|Gone Girl has spent so many weeks on the NYT bestseller list that adding another review seems like piling on, but it's such a compelling read that I couldn't resist. Nick and Amy have it all, a picture-perfect marriage, great jobs in NYC, a fat trust fund courtesy of Amy's parents, but this doesn't make for much of a story. So, bad things have to happen, and they do. The author tells the story from two first-person points of view. Nick, for the most part, speaks in the present tense, while Amy's version is told in epistolary form, also first-person.<br />Things begin to unravel as Nick's mother gets a cancer diagnosis, his father is institutionalized with Alzheimer's, the nice trust fund is reclaimed by Amy's parents to cover their own debts. Then Nick moves Amy to Carthage, MO, which seems like it's on another planet compared to their current home.<br />At first the author begins to peel away the facade of the perfect marriage is small bits, all of which might be expected with so much stress occurring. Then, on their fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears. The home scene indicates that she didn't leave willingly, but the scene appears to be staged, and there's partially cleaned blood (hers) on the kitchen floor.<br />Amy characteristically celebrates their anniversaries with a treasure hunt, leaving clues for Nick to follow. Now those clues make him look like a murderer. Amy has secrets. Nick has secrets too, such as the young mistress he's been keeping company with for the past year.<br />The story is masterfully plotted. Amy is one of the more frightening sociopaths to come along for some time, reminiscent of the Kathleen Turner character in \\"Body Heat,\\" some years ago. The use of two first-person narrators adds to the suspense. Is either of them truly reliable? Whom do we believe? Great to spend time in the hands of such a skillful writer!
0345803493|5.0|I can't put these books down.  I had originally bought just the first one not sure whether I would like them or not but I ended up buying this one and the last one.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Lots of fun and very entertaining.  Even the wife likes to play when she can get it away from the kids and she has never liked playing games.
B004LROUW2|5.0|Loved this book - it's fantasy with enough meat to make you think about what world we really live in.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game was not very challenging at all and way too many hidden object scenes. It was a disappointment.  Good graphics though.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved the game! I'm usually not a big fan of games with hidden object puzzles, as they can become kind of monotonous. But here they were incorporated into the game-play in a way that made them actually entertaining for me. Interesting story, fun puzzles, and overall a good way to spend an afternoon or evening (or you can play it in the middle of the night - whatever floats your boat).
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my daughter-in-law who has our granddaughter who is only 20 months.  She tends to grab her mom's phone when no one is looking.  It looks very good and is a lot smaller and than the otterbox.  It also protects from water where the otterbox she did have did not.
B008R96NIY|5.0|Just when I am resolved never again to read a book about the origins of the First World War another one comes along.  This must be the most covered subject in history and yet they still come.  I have often thought that result of that war was so ghastly that generations have tried to justify the catastrophe by blaming somebody else.  Up to recently the memory was still too painful.  In Australia almost every little hamlet has its sad memorial in the main street with the local honour role of serving soldiers inscribed with, inevitably 30% of them marked as killed in action. Add double the number as wounded and one can see where the almost 70% casuality rate arose.  I am sure the same sad shrines are in Canada and New Zealand and scorch<br />the memory in the narratives of all participating countries.<br /><br />The passage of time maybe allowing a new generation of scholars to take a more objective view of the events that led to it.  The trouble with history is that the reader knows what happens next, the participants do not.  After the disaster no wonder they tried to cover their tracks in self serving memoirs.  Clark unpicks all of this and the title of the book encapsulates the reality.  For the first time I feel a grasp of the subject, thanks to this excellent and highly readable book.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The book is decent for Cornwell. I was expecting better from her but I am not terribly surprised given the previous book was not that great as well.<br /><br />I enjoyed the concept behind this one and the storyline in comparison to the last, however; I felt it lacked.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The story has been told many times, but it is a cute read.  A happy ending is always a bonus.
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|i almost didn't bother to even listen to this band and just out of pure curiosity went ahead and did,,,, well after i listened to them i found i had tears in my eyes !!!!! of course they were tears of joy..for me a revelation,, one of the best ,, freshest bands i have heard in a very long time.. the connection between band and audience is nothing short of magic. there are so many fine musicans in the group , playing really cool different sounding music it's actually hard to keep track of who is doing what. that said,, there is no way you can listen without finding yourself grooving right along..i think this cd captures the spirit and essence of the band better than their previous release as this is more striped down and alittle less complex...a classic case of less is more. only time will tell if they can capture the energy of their live shows on cd..no matter what,,  you need to experience this great band and their gift !!! get your hands this cd.. or better still go see them live,,if they come to your area....5 stars for the love
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A+++.  Period.  No complaints.  100% enthused.  Fast shipment and best deal around.  Truly an exemplary blu ray experience.  Gorgeous.  Great.

0307943232|4.0|The book is classic Grisham; it is great.<br />The production of the CDs is sloppy.<br />I like to listen to audio books on my iPod, so I import the CDs into iTunes.<br />importing the CDs to iTunes is troublesome because only the first CDs have the proper digital descriptions for iTunes to properly identify the CDs.<br />Here are the CD's digital identifications:<br />CD-1  The Racketeer<br />CD-2  The Racketeer ~ [Disc 2]<br />CD-3  The Racketeer 3<br />CD-4  The Racketeer ~ [Disc 4]<br />CD-5  The Racketeer 0510<br />CD-6  10.

I expected professional quality from Random House Audio.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Good, but didn't like John Goodman's character.  Shocked by the events and how this movie playe out.  Pretty sad movie, but liked the ending.
B004LUS390|3.0|I found the ap to be like a graphics program from the early 2000 but not as flexible as say illustrator. My biggest issue was the speed. But perhaps it was because I used it on a Kindle, instead of an I pad where I first saw it.
B0012HRJEA|3.0|I appreciate that real text is used.  The style feels abrasive, and it doesn't add to the story.  It just hurts the flow.  I do remember being pretty happy about it in 1996, but it does not stand the test of time.  Nevertheless, if you are studying Shakespeare's story, this is a must watch.  What makes the story move forward?  How are the relationships and each character portrayed?  Mostly engaging cinematography.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Love this movie! And when my husband and I realized we didn't own it, went and got it. Can't beat the price!

B005LAII8K|5.0|I have to admit , I am partial to time travel stories (both Books + Films) . Loopers has a different take , of the genre . The flaw is the time for the narrative , but as we all know this is very common in &#34; Action&#34; films, If I say more I will be giving the plot away.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|We very excited to find this for the same price that it was on Black Friday, for I had gone out to buy it, only to find it all sold out.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|As the title suggests, this movie is one of a kind. The only thing that saves this picture from being pure porn, is the fact that it shows history in a very unrepentant light. Peter O'Toole as the aging decrepit lecher Tiberius was incredible acting and no doubt the now paradise isle of Capri was in his time, every bit the lecher's palace it was reputed to be and he was as mercurial and dangerous in his senility as he was portrayed. Malcolm McDowell was excellent as Caligula who was raised on Capri under the aging emperor's watchful and dangerous scrutiny and behaved as he could, much like his Uncle Claudius who also played the idiot in order to survive the dangerous monarchs under which he was forced to live. As was said in some other reviews the sex portrayed in this picture was with a jaded view and the banquets seen were possibly more like what actually was than the usual view of the obligatory fat men besmeared with wine. Considering the climate of the time, it was a wonder Nerva didn't slit his wrists sooner.My sympathies actually laid with Macro, the Captain Prefect who tried to play two ends against the middle and killed Tiberius to help Caligula only to fall victim himself when Caligula had him killed for the murder, Longinus the long suffering treasurer who had to bend under Caligula's crazed policy, Drusilla, his sister, the only voice of reason in the young Emperor's madness, and Chaerea, the new Prefect who became increasingly disgruntled enough with Caligula's mercurial nature to finally take a sword to him to end it. This was not the Rome of Cecil B. Demille or the big buget classics, but rather, a Rome that was a bit more real and much less appetizing, more like the Rome that existed in the heyday of the mad Emperors, the one a time traveler is more likely to find---and much less likely to want to explore. This movie is one of a kind. I would like to see it stay that way as anything like it would only be worse.
B0012FHGCW|5.0|This film is worth seeing just for the editing alone. It is one of the most well-edited films I've ever seen; no wonder it was nominated for such. The unfolding of the story and character development wouldn't have been so impactful without this unique way in which it was told, so kudos to Sean Penn and the editor for that. Beyond the masterful filmmaking, the story was simply fascinating because on a primal level we can all relate. This is the type of film that makes me want to read the book. I've heard that some artistic license has been taken with some details in the movie, but that's okay. If it makes you want to read the book, which is as close to the original story as we can get without knowing the family, then the film has succeeded even if some details were changed. It still remains inspiring. It's an outlet for similar emotions we've all had at some point of wanting to get away from it all and figure out what meaning and truth is on a most basic level. He was looking for truth and meaning, and he probably found it, only made some mistakes along the way and found it too late. But he was only a kid, and we can forgive him his unfortunate choices. The friends he made along the way forgave him, and so can the audience. As Oscar-winner Hal Holbrooke's character says to him, &#34;Forgiveness leads to love. And when you find love, God's light shines upon you.&#34; (or something to that effect). No matter that i'm completely non-religious. That was still the line that sums up what this story is really all about. Thank you Sean Penn for telling it this way. You rock! Hope you are finding your own truth and meaning in Haiti.
B004M8S3Y6|4.0|Haven't read all of this as yet but you don't need to. I wanted it for the menu however have found the other chapters interesting and entertaining. Quick download.
B005T87QCI|5.0|love the game great graphics and the controls are not glitchy you just can't attack when you are getting pumled gloves up and you are fine also before you play hit puase and read the command list it really helps
B005QVUZIU|5.0|When I saw the movie, I fell in love with the score. I do realize that some of it was something similar to the recent Zorro movies, it had a quaility of its own that was more than a mere copy. &#34;The Giant's Castle&#34; had a beautiful lullaby quality. &#34;Jack and Jill&#34; was appropriately sinister but with overtones of humor.<br />&#34;I was always there&#34;, was striking when Humpty reveals his plans. The most rousing though was &#34;Chasing Tail&#34; and &#34;Diablo Rojo&#34; when Puss and Kitty meet and get into a dance fight, and then later &#34;Hanuman&#34; when they finally got the Golden Goose and were celebrating their victory. Yes, Puss was a bad kitty,but not that bad, and the score helped to make a wonderful funny movie.
B00466HN6S|5.0|All my neice and nephew talked about was this movie hop so I had to get it for them so they would stop asking!
B000T45C6E|5.0|Saw it for the second time yesterday. Inspiring no matter how many times I watch it. I Recommend it highly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was an amazing book filled with love, hate, teenage drama, and all the qualities of a page turner. I would definitely recommend this to anyone in need of a good read.
B005LAIH2W|3.0|While I would say that &#34;John Carter&#34; was worth seeing, I must admit the book it came from, sadly, is a little dated. With Opportunity and Curiosity roaming the vast empty plains of the true Mars, it is hard for me to reconcile or suspend my belief to this. True, it had a great storyline, though a little hard to follow at times,good characters and great effects and for that reason I've collected it, Still, what was believeable in the thirties, forties and fifties, is not so much now in thr light of the Twenty-first century. If this had been a world other than Mars, and the timeline it was written, it would be easier to accept. It's a good movie, but not great.
B008MIMWOO|5.0|I bought this when they were on sale for $9.99 and as always I was paying attention and when I got them home and open to realize they were blu-ray it was agreat deal!!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|A very good movie, not as captivating as the books but good nonetheless.  I would recommend it but only for more mature audiences as the theme is violent and grim.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is an improvement of over games of this type. More tiles, lots of similar looking tiles. Takes me longer than usual to solve the game.
B0009MAO46|5.0|I have the trilogy, and it was wonderful, but the beginning, when Buzz and Woody first meet brought us into the world of toys and their down to earth concerns of being replaced by something &#34;better&#34; and then forgotten about or sold away or thrown away. Woody has been Andy's top toy for some time, but soon finds his top spot usurped by a new Space toy named Buzz Lightyear. In an act of jealousy, he arranges a plot to hide Buzz from sight, but to his horror it gets out of hand when Buzz falls out of the window and Woody is accused of trying to terminate Buzz. In an attempt to get him back, Woody has to reconcile his own feelings all while dealing with Buzz's delusion that he is a real Space Ranger on a mission. It ends in the house of the nortorious Sid, a kid with an obsession for fireworks--and destroying toys. Buzz and Woody then must work together to befriend the toys in Sid's house to help free them from Sid's tyranny and escape Sid's house before Andy's family moves away. It is a straightforward story with a great script and wonderful acting between Tom Hanks as Woody, and Tim Allen as Buzz. Well worth watching time and time again.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing! I'm usually not a romance type of gal but I decided to give this book a try and I'm really glad I did because it kept me on edge and every time I turned a page I fell in love with Alex
B000A7DVRC|5.0|Great movie! This is definitely a cult-classic that most people will either love or hate although most people I know love it. The bonus material gives amusing behind the scenes information as would be expected with this hilarious film
B007REV4T8|1.0|Remember a time when bond films like \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\", and \\"You only live Twice\\" had massive sets that were a spectacle event? You won't see that in the most recent James bond edition Skyfall. A couple of helicopter shots of exotic locations by the B camera team is all your going to get for this reported 150 to 200 million dollar production cost of the film. Looking for DVD extras and director commentary on this bond film like the first Casino Royal film?, sorry, there are none to be found. Apparently the producers were too busy counting their 1 billion dollar box office receipts to give extras to the DVD and Blueray consumer.You will however get 4 or 5 comercials at the beginning of the DVD you paid for that cannot be skipped with the disc menu or scene skip button. They needed to pepper you with commercials whether you wanted to see them or not.<br /><br />The only good thing about this 200 million dollar film: Daniel Craig's performance, which can make even the much overused opening car chase seem like a believable story point.<br /><br />Let us hope he got a good portion of this films budget, as his performance is the only thing that keeps this genre alive.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Once again, Mitch Albom pulls you into his very soul.  To me, this book is better than the five you meet on your way to heaven (or something like that) and definitely in line with Tuesday's with Maury.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great story telling. Love the characters. Certainly a great sci-fi page turner. Very slight drag in the middle but it comes together very strong. Would recommend to any sci-fi fan!!
0553277472|5.0|im a big fan of buying used books.  you save some money and trees(environment).  the book came quickly and is in described condition.  thx!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great Bible app. cant browse plans for some reason, but still my favorite Bible app. love all the versions available!
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My daughter got this game for our kindle and my kids play it often :)  It's a cute game thanks
B009VLX8FS|3.0|Not your typical country album. Music and lyrics sound great, but if you are looking for &#34;country&#34; try her previous albums.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is very clearly written with unpresidented insight into people and what motivates them.  I would recommend anyone who is in a relationship to read it...it's easy reading and will certainly save many a relationship.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Pure, unmitigated Wes Anderson perfection. This film is an exquisite, worthy companion to Rushmore. Mr. Anderson's grasp of the best and worst aspects of being human, combined with a technical wizardry that is unparalleled, results in a film that leaves you looking at your own life with fresh wonder. At least, it did for me. And that's what I go looking for.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|awesome but minecraft is better so boo ya la la la la la la la la la la la la la laxative
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like a nice well done trashy novel.  It doesn't have to be brilliant literature, as long as it's well written and thought out.  This was a good read, and I'd probably read it again.  I don't say that about many of them, but this was actually good.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book renewed my sense of patriotism. I especially admired Chris Kyle's humble nature. Even knowing his accomplishments and heroic actions, he never portrays himself as being any better than others in his unit.  Great book!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|This would be 5 stars except they left out Eponene's dying song with Marius.  Very disappointing.  Otherwise, the presentation takes you right through the movie.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This app can play radio stations from the other side of the world! And any station that you love best. Glad I got out while it was free during Christmas time. Top bad the update won't work. This is an awesome app. The free version cannot record, but this one can record over an hour of song. I don't know what the limit is but it's good to record your songs. looks real good for kindle fire and even plays online radio streams. Love this app!!
B00846F1YW|3.0|I can get to chapter 11-2 then some of the objects are hidden behind the timer bar and one does not come out.  It's very frustrating to getting all the objects and know where the last one is yet not be able to get it.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Based on true story, The 6 Americans who were hid by Canadians are able to evade capture and return home
B00932A2MC|5.0|Didn't know how they'd manage to make a movie out of a board game, but this was surprisingly entertaining!  Plot was good, liked how the guy grew into his leadership role
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was filled with action and suspense it was the best book i ever read my favorite part was the s sections
B000Q66JXA|1.0|Forgot that I walked out of a theater after the first 15 minutes of the start of this thing and then bought it.  Ugh, what a boo boo.  Certainly tastes are different for different folks, but if you like tales of the Round Table, this one shouldn't be on your list.  From the acting of the character that does Merlin to the destruction of the legend, this thing gets worse the longer it is watched.  Think it was given to a neighbor that I didn't like and he didn't know it at the time.  He does now.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Started watching it and couldn't stop.  Found myself loosing track of time.  Would definately recommend it to my friends and family.  Almost through the 5th season and will probably watch from season one again.
B002NJUN44|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He was thrilled and smiled like a little boy! He loves it
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I purchased this mic, after seeing (and hearing) a great video review of it.  I am using it with a Canon Vexia.  I've used the mic now on several videos and am extremely pleased with the quality of sound! The difference between the on-camera mic (which is pretty decent,) and the mic, is tremendous. The sound is crisp and clear. For the price, if it lasted 6 months, I'd be fine with that, but I'm hoping to get a year or so out of it. :)<br /><br />The only complaint is that the foam windscreen on the mic, falls off constantly. There should be a better design. It would be cool if something was included to manage the length of cord it uses. I'm using a twisty tie from the kitchen to keep things untangled.<br /><br />Happy with the purchase. May add a video review soon, so you can hear the difference.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Great Action Adventure with a really good plot and lots of great actors!  It will keep you sitting on the edge of your seat!
B00899F0G8|5.0|It's been great catching up on the first two years and I can hardly wait for the new episodes to be available!
B007NESBK2|5.0|This is a must have for anybody who has followed Sade from the beginning.  The music and visual performance is outstanding.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|Helloween has always impressed me since the arrival of Deris into the band. He has added another level to this band during each and every new album that they put together since his arrival. His voice is amazing, guitar riffs and drum smashing are awesome. If you are an Helloween fan, this album is a must to your collection!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's just as fun as at the carnival but definitely cheaper ... Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx Xxx xxxcccc Xxx Cfc Xxx
B000JMKTLO|5.0|A great page turner indeed! Unexpected and cleverly written; never a dull moment.  Just the right amount of suspense, thrill and internal struggle from the main character.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so fun and there is so many options. And I love the cool Christmas add ons
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Really did not think i would enjoy this type of book with its sci fi kind of theme, but i was unable to put it down, looking forward to reading more. Great to read something completely different
0316017930|5.0|This book really opened my eyes to how success is really had by the lucky few.  Well written and easy to understand. Anyone can read this and come away with a new understanding of the world we live in. This book needs to be read by all so that we may change the way we encourage and discourage success. I am enriched by reading this book and look forward to reading more by Gladwell.<br /><br />Rated Outliers a 5 because I started recommending the book before I had even finished it.  Recommended to people in 9th grade and up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got lost in this story, in the world of the silo, right from the start. So much that I never noticed the flaws other reviewers have pointed out. The concept is imaginative, and the characters well-developed. I was so engrossed by the story that when the main villain was justifying his rationale for what he has done, I almost agreed with him (almost!). This is a book that kept me up at night, reading as fast as I could to see what happened next. It left me wanting more, and I look forward to the continuation of the story.
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|Watched this movie then watched the New DREDD with Karl Urban.  They both did a great job being a bad ass Judge.  Of Course it is pure entertainment!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Still making quality products and not cutting corners...this knife is a slab of Sharp metal designed for survival and tough use.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars by John Green<br /><br />I am going to review this book through a fictional conversation that has some truth to it.  Just in case you didn't know, I am a high school social studies teacher who loves to read and talk about books so this conversation takes place in school.<br /><br />Librarian Susan:  Have you read The Fault in Our Stars yet?<br />Me:  No, Should I?<br />Reading Teacher Sue:  (the very next day) Have you read The Fault in Our Stars yet?<br />Me:  No. (me thinking- why do people keep talking about this book?) Have you read Looking for Alaska?  I loved it.<br />Sue:  You really need to read it, it will change your world.<br />Me:  OK, I will try and get it from the library.<br /><br />A few weeks go by and I finally get the Ebook through my library app.<br /><br />Me:  (at lunch talking to Elizabeth the English teacher) Have you read The Fault in Our Stars?<br />Elizabeth:  Oh my, yes, it was amazing.  Augustus is my book boyfriend.  I am convinced he is one of the best male characters in literature today.<br />Me:  I think I am in love with John Green.  He does something to my heart when I read his books that no one else does.  (This is only the second book I have read by John Green and I am already confessing my love.  This means something).<br /><br />Elizabeth and I walk to class after lunch continuing to discuss \\"the book\\".  Two of my 9th grade students overhear.<br /><br />Students:  Where are you in the book?<br />Me:  Page 50.  I stayed up till 11pm reading, while my husband kept snoring beside me.  I can't believe I was having this awesome reading experience and he was sleeping through it.  I had to force myself to stop reading because I needed to get up early.<br />Students:  Have you read the part where you find out the reason the book is named, The Fault in Our Stars?<br />Me:  No, why?<br />Students:  Because it relates to what we are learning in class about Rome.  You know Julius Caesar and Brutus and Cassius and stuff.<br />Me:  OMG, that is too cool.  I love it when the things we do and experience in real life show up in the history we are learning about.  Everything is connected!<br /><br />Next day,<br /><br />Elizabeth:  (through email)  Did you finish The Fault in Our Stars yet??<br />Me:  (thinking, only 1 day has gone by, she must think I am a fast reader.)  No.  I am trying to savor it and read it as slowly as possible.  (there is some truth to that)<br />Elizabeth:  Ok, just make sure you read the last 100 pages in private.<br />Me: (thinking inside my head) Uh-Oh, this means I am probably going to cry.<br /><br />Another day goes by.<br /><br />Me:  (through email)  Elizabeth, I'm so sad right now.  Our book boyfriend, (did you notice I used \\"Our\\" instead of \\"hers\\"?) Augustus has cancer and I am really worried.  I might need to take a break from the ending.  My heart is breaking and I'm having trouble breathing.  (this is what happens to serious readers, when they begin to take on the characteristics of the characters they love)<br />Elizabeth:  Total waterworks from here on out.<br /><br />Later on the same day while I was reading on the couch<br /><br />Husband: Are you crying?  About a book? (Did I mention he is a non-reader?) (Poor husband, he will never know the amazing experience of reading a book that affects your emotions in ways you cannot predict.)<br />Me:  Yes. Can you bring me a box of tissues?  (at this point, I was nearing the end of the book)<br /><br />Next day at school.<br />I walk into the room where I eat lunch.<br />Elizabeth and I make eye contact.  She knows what I am feeling, she knows the amazing experience I just had reading The Fault in Our Stars.  She knows I can't talk about it right now.  She knows that Augustus and Hazel are amazing characters and She knows that \\"The world is not a wish-granting factory\\".  She knows that the side effect of dying is cancer and that falling in love is not likely to happen when you aren't feeling your best but that it happens when you least expect it.  She knows that you must live your best life today because we don't have an infinite amount of tomorrows.  She knows as only another reader can know.  Sigh.<br /><br />Tomorrow when I see Elizabeth, Susan, Sue and Students, I will smile and say \\"Okay instead of always\\" and they will know the language I speak.<br />Okay.t but that it happens when you least expect it.  She knows that you must live your best life today because we don't have an infinite amount of tomorrows.  She knows as only another reader can know.  Sigh.<br /><br />Tomorrow when I see Elizabeth, Susan, Sue and Students, I will smile and say \\"Okay instead of always\\" and they will know the language I speak.<br />Okay.
B00004YRQA|5.0|buen producto con llegada rápida de atención y tiempo, la especificación deseada sin problemas de contratiempo recomendado este vendedor ok
B00127RAJY|2.0|My copy was a bootleg. The disc is functional, I'm just annoyed that I paid for something that is so obviously pirated.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a awesome dictionary. I like it because it is neat. I recommend this to every one. The reason is, is because it's big help with school, and its kind of a cheat when u have to look up words. So everyone come and get this book.
B007704HO6|5.0|LOVED LOVED it! A must read for those who love cats but also for those who are touched by miracles!
B00AAQ7JNA|3.0|We gathered with my friends to watch this blu ray (I haven't watched it before this party so it was the first experience for all of us) and the sound was just killing the whole thing. While the concert itself is amazing the audio is just not as good as you expect in 2012/2013. Video quality is OK but sometimes you can notice pixels. Not actually pixels but large squares like the footage was taken in SD and then remastered, you see those (or something similar) while watching cable with problems on the line. Long story short: the release is OK but not awesome. Take care!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are awesome! I read through all three in a week. If you have only seen the movie, I highly recommend reading the trilogy!
0823003035|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book, Most informative detailed book on fiqure drawing that I have ever read. I would compare it to &#34;Carlson's guide to Landscape Painting&#34; which is also one of my all time favorites. Both books put an emphasis on light, a subject that is often skimmed over in art books.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The best of the best.  I just wish there were more books to read.  The story was again packed with excitement and suspense.  I can imagine that any other stories that may have come from Stieg Larsson whould have been best sellers as well.
B007RXRSEY|5.0|I love Myles Kennedy, as well as Slash. Naturally I wanted to get this cd. The playing style of Slash just gels with the amazing vocals of Myles Kennedy. I recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys killer musicians getting together and playing their tooshies off!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is a great series. A great gift for anyone who enjoys war movies... the boxed set is nicely packaged and looks great with my dvd collection.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|This was a realy realy good movie. I realy liked it! good for long trips. it was realy realy good.
B00846F1YW|4.0|this is a fun game. the game progresses nicely although the dialog is unrealistic. I bought when it was free and have enjoyed it.
