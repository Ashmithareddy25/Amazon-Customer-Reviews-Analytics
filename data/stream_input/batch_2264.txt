B003YL4LYI|5.0|It gets 5 stars cause I love the story, but it was a little weak in spots for how long it was. The ending left me with more questions then answers. Only 3 years to go till the next one....
B005EGXTL2|5.0|what a great read just loved it.I would like to read more of Suzanne Collins books she writes a good story
0553382179|4.0|I understand the philosophy behind this book, and followed it pretty much to the letter.  However, I learned, to my detriment, that not all &#34;stuff&#34; that isn't used should be thrown out.  Some things, especially those things that belong to a child at school, aren't being used and you'd think would not have sentimental value.  Just understand that you may be WRONG in thinking this.  I certainly was.  And replacing something purchased in 1984 at today's prices when you realize that you DO need it can require a second mortgage.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Was not to happy with this book because it didn't tell you what happened to all the people it left you hanging no real ending.
0307276902|5.0|When I read this book, the mess that occurred when Oprah found out it was fiction was over.  All that went over my head.  This book still touched my heart and I had tears in my eyes at certain points.  Just because it's fiction doesn't mean that it isn't good fiction.  And this is.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Great game so much to do on here like when you think you finish it starts again it very amazing and no problems at all. Download greatest game

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Argo is Ben Affleck's third movie he has directed and he is 3 for 3. This movie deals with the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis in which Iranian revolutionaries stormed the American Embassy and took everyone hostage, but six managed to escape. The movie focuses on  getting those six out before they are captured and executed.<br /><br />The movie begins with a brief history of the region, and how the US and British government had controlled the country and its resources for decades until Iran revolted and forced the Western designated Shah out, but now demanded he return and face punishment. After taking the embassy the CIA comes up with a plan to get the six out. Tony Mendez, the operative who orchestrated the plan, comes up with an idea to create a fake movie and have the six pose as film crew and ultimately get out of the country.<br /><br />The acting is very solid, Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston do great jobs as the CIA agents fronting this mission. John Goodman and Alan Arkin are also great as the movie producers fronting the fake movie.<br /><br />The last half hour of this film is very intense and nerve wracking, and it will have you on the edge of your seat. All said and done this is a fast two hour movie that is never boring. Do give this movie a view if you want to watch a great thriller.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fantastic show, great storyline, interesting characters and location. Would recommend others view Season 1, along with Season 2. Can't wait for Season 3 on streaming video
B00BG08FKK|1.0|They should have announced initially that a complete \\"deluxe\\" edition would be forthcoming. I had already bought the highlights album thinking that would be all that would be available. I would have waited had I known. I feel cheated.

B009WO7NQO|2.0|I love this game. I love it for free on my phone. I'm new to the kindle fire so I figure ok ill pay this for the full game, why not I love it right? No, I don't love it anymore. If I read the reviews and knew I was paying for half a game I would not have even bothered. This whole situation is really disappointing. Rovio is really challenging their long time customers with this kind of junk...
B001IASHWY|5.0|It is an action packed movie with great characters.  Good follow up movie for Hellboy. Some parts of the movie are hilarious.  Fun movie.

B007EC6FIS|5.0|Keane is one of my very favorite bands, and I am delighted with their newest effort. Critics bashed them for scuttling back to the safety zone of their classic sound with this album, but for the last two works (Perfect Symmetry and Night Train), they were criticized for deviating from that very same sound, and being experimental! It's ridiculous -what would the critics have?? Keane may be an easy target though, because they don't conform very well to the shallow expectations of the music industry. Their music isn't edgy, pretentious,sexy or macho. Keane isn't a moronic pop spectacle.  Their songs are sincere and heartfelt, emotionally vulnerable and beautiful, both lyrically and sonically.<br />  This album feels like a culmination of sorts. \\"Strangeland\\" seems to have taken all the emotional territory that Keane has explored in their albums so far - whether thoughts of what's to come in \\"Hopes and Fears,\\" the bleak claustrophobia of \\"Under the Iron Sea\\" or the discussion of external problems and pressures such as war and superficiality in \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" - and essentially approached them with a newfound sense of grace and emotional maturity. It's at once nostalgic, sorrowful, comforting, hopeful and life-affirming.<br />  There isn't a bad track on the album, and Tim's songwriting is as exquisite  as ever.  Standouts for me include:<br /> \\"Sovereign Light Cafe,\\" actually the first Keane song I heard and the one that made me fall in love with their music. (I was too little to know about them when H&F originally made them big.)<br />\\"Sea Fog,\\" - spare, haunting and devout, similar to the heartwrenching \\"Hamburg Song.\\"<br />\\"You Are Young\\" - by all respects this song should be sappy but its saved by the sincerity and skill of Tom's delivery, and is instead one of the sweetest things I've ever heard.<br />My only criticism of the album would be that I think some of the masterful B sides and bonus tracks, particularly \\"Myth\\" and \\"Strangeland\\" should have switched places with maybe \\"Watch How You Go\\" and \\"In Your Own Time.\\" While I loved both, I think I would have preferred having \\"Myth\\" and \\"Strangeland\\" on the basic album instead as they are just so astonishingly good (but admittedly don't fit the overall theme of the album quite as well.)<br />I was lucky enough to see them perform live in San Franciso in their \\"Strangeland\\" tour earlier this year. It was simply fantastic. Tom's singing was beautiful, just as good as or better than it sounded on the recording, and the energy and passion that the whole group played with was infectious and inspiring.  I love these guys and can't wait for whatever they do next!
B009P0VLGI|4.0|I bought this cd because of one song that is played in a movie. I don't buy singles because usually there is another track I might like. Unexpectedly, I found that not only was there more good tracks, but it turns out that the whole album was really good.

B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book is well written, poetic at times, suspenseful, complex. I'd strongly recommend it. Going to read more of her books.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Played it for about an hour or two till I ran out of energy and missions to play. Stopped playing for a few hours and when I went back on I still had no energy to do anything. All my new missions require me to buy stuff which requires energy. Buuuuuut I can't buy anything cause my energy won't replenish. Don't know if I'm missing something or if the game is just freaking out.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Nice and consistent continuation of Hunger Games story. Hope next in trilogy will be as good. Hope they do not make movies of them though.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This book didn't come up to the same standards as the first book of the triology.  The ending didn't leave anticipation for the<br />final book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am a big fan of hidden object games.  Although I am only on level 3, this game is fun.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|The quality of all the songs is consistent throughout the album. I've found some nice surprises. Would recommend to anyone I know.
B00B23O96A|5.0|Anyone who rates this less than 5 stars is not an EC fan. Buy it and grow. Just like \\"461 Ocean Blvd\\" \\"Behind the Sun\\"  \\"No Reason to Cry\\" everyone just needs to chill and appreciate one of the true gifts of our generation..........<br />Peace
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Truly enjoyed this book, another wonderful read from Nicholas Sparks! I will continue to read more of his books in the future.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am so impressed with this book. A raw and honest look at relationships that involve mental illness and the basic human condition. I loved the characters and found them very relatable.
B007SGM084|3.0|This should have never been a trilogy. The first book was just enough of this story line. The other 2 books (esp the third book) were just a way to include more sex scenes (although I can appreciate that). The story lines got more and more ridiculous (not the sex scenes) until in the end you just had a &#34;harlequin novel&#34;.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 shades is such a good book. I have never read anything like this in my life. It was very liberating.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|It is a very good movie and I'm pleased. Excerpts of this movie will be used in my treatment center.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|it's. a good mystery game to play.if it allowed the full version of it.to play it.it is fun to play.

0316044695|1.0|It was difficult to take this book seriously.  Mr. Luttrell was arrogant and prideful but throughout the text he confused several facts and groups as the Taliban, Sunni's and Al Queda.  His attitude of a tough boy  and not caring for mankind when he said \\"some of the wrong people get killed\\"  (p 176), but whines thrugh \\"his\\" story.  When using language of four letter words (and other 5 and 6 letters) is a sign of ignorance,and unnecessary. A lot of what Mr. Luttrell said did not add up... he reminded me of a spoiled 5 year old with a \\"poor me\\" attitude bcause he didn't make as much money as the \\"highly paid\\" correspondants, \\"they are the heros, Seals aren't\\".  If he graduated from Sam Houston U why was in enlisted? and not an officer.  One doesn't go to med. school without a degree.  I wanted his politics left out and enjoyed reading about what the Seals go through to make the grade but is what he said true?<br />  Luttrell says its a fact that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction. I felt his hate of people was built on his own fear.  He sees all Muslims as terrorists, out to kill Americans. I believe many people felt that way about Germans after WWII. Ben Sharmak,  was not an important target, he never had 80 to 200 men, in his videos show he had 8-10 men.  Luttrell wanted to show what a tough fight they had and he embellished his story.<br />  Michael Murphy's father said he had dishonored his son and the decision to \\"vote\\" was untrue.  I wonder how the families felt about the details on the deaths of their sons.  I think most people can find a more truthful and accurate read about the Seals than wasting your time here.<br />  Luttrell was arrested in a bar fight in 2008 and in 2009 he received a medicial retirement from the Navy. Another tough guy looking for a $1!<br /><br />  S, a family member of a retired military officer

B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have every KISS album since 1974 and know their music inside and out, and this is as great an album as any KISS fan could ask or hope for in the year 2012/2013.  There's almost no filler and the band sounds tight and hungry on every track.  What's nice about it is that Eric and Tommy have come into their own a bit more, so they're not quite mimicking the styles of the members they have replaced (although their make-up is similar ;)  And as much as we all love Ace & Peter, having the younger new blood in the band clearly inspires and reinvigorates Gene and Paul, since they sound as good as they have in decades.  This is a stronger album than 2009's 'Sonic Boom' mostly because they stopped ripping themselves off a bit and borrowed a page or two from the bands who inspired THEM, which is a much better formula for a band who will never be able to live up to their 70s heyday no matter how much they try (though the 1996 Reunion tour did come close!)<br /><br />So buy Monster, enjoy it all, and rock with the new/current/future KISS!
B004T0E2S8|1.0|This app worked great on my older HTC evo, but like everyone else I found it wouldn't work on my Nexus 7. I assumed that the vendor was not fixing the issue and was frustrated as I love the app and wanted a new phone. After some research though, it appears the developer has address the issue, but Amazon is not making the updated version available. I'm going to rebuy through the google play store, but I'll think twice before buy any more apps through the amazon app store.

0345803493|5.0|if you're a romantic you will surely love this book! get all three books! It's mind blowing and really exciting!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|There was a time when I'd have waited months if not years to pick up a season set, they were always priced too high and the sales were few and far between. Lately (since the introduction of HBO GO) sets have been priced at the sweet spot where I never mind picking them up. This one was a treat in that it came with a DVD copy AND a digital download code to make sure I've got access to the show no matter where I'm at.<br /><br />As far as the actual set is concerned, it's great, probably the most ambitious show HBO has put on in a long time, the quality of the transfer to Blu is great, the audio is fantastic and the extras are awesome if you don't have the books handy.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I must say: \\"I'm impressed!\\" This was a great story and I could not put it down. Very well done! I liked that the author did not give away the entire plot right away and developed the characters and setting before springing the ending on the reader. I'm glad the author didn't try to wrap everything up in a nice bow and rainbows and also left me wanting to read what he can come up with next to further the story.

1416511946|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read this year. I was a little afraid of the book at first because its very heavy (for a book) and the pages can be distracting, however it was an awesome book!!! The pictures/illustrations help make the information on the pages sink in better. The challenges and torment that he put his body, mind and everyone around him through is a miracle that he is still here with any friends. I would def purchase this book again and recommend it to people.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I do enjoy a puzzle rpg, and this reminds me of Gyromancer.  It also has music like walking through towns in the Jrpg series Tales.  All in all a very charming and relaxing combination that seems worth playing.  It probably deserves having$5 spent on it too with so much work put into it, but you have to be able to afford such splurges rather than waiting for the free app of the day.

B003PBB4ME|5.0|I don't use this product very often as I opt for my shoulder harness to shoot most of my motion video, but when a low perspective is required the Opteka X-GRIP Professional Camera / Camcorder Action Stabilizing Handle works very well. As I am an over-enthusiastic photo/video enthusiast, this review will be written from the perspective of a man who loves toys, but knows there are limitations to my expertise. So professional video guys may not find what I say very useful.<br /><br />Observations: There is not much to a grip handle product so I really didn't expect much. The Opteka X-GRIP Professional Camera / Camcorder Action Stabilizing Handle's adjustable screw plate attaches to my [[ASIN:B002NEGTTW Canon EOS 7D Digital SLR Camera]]. The shoe attachment accommodates my [[ASIN:B004TJ6JH6 NEEWER® 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Digital Camera / Camcorder Video Light]] or my [[ASIN:B0007U9SOC Rode VideoMic Condenser Microphone]].  So it functions as it is supposed to.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The construction feels sturdy, but it is also lightweight<br />The adjustable wedge plate works with compact video cams & DSLRs as well as larger cameras like the [[ASIN:B00006FXHQ Canon GL2 MiniDV Digital Camcorder w/20x Optical Zoom]]<br />The cushion handle is nice in longer shooting situations where the hand might sweat a lot or get fatigued<br />the rails on the bottom are rubber coated to ensure stability when placing unit on a surface<br />Very reasonable price<br />Easy to bring along on a shoot for just in case moments<br /><br />Cons:<br />Would have preferred metal construction on the mounts since you are sometimes placing expensive equipment on it<br />With larger camcorders the unit feels a bit off balance<br /><br />No matter what the cons might be, they simply cannot convince me to rate the Opteka X-GRIP Professional Camera / Camcorder Action Stabilizing Handle with anything but five stars. The unit functions unpretentiously, but for the price, the unit works great and it can easily and inexpensively be added to anyone's camera equipment stash. I would highly recommend the Opteka X-GRIP Professional Camera / Camcorder Action Stabilizing Handle for anyone who can spare the $20 to get it.easily and inexpensively be added to anyone's camera equipment stash.

1476734941|1.0|As someone who has managed to lose and keep off 60 pounds, I wish diets like these would stay out of the limelight. I call these \\"yo-yo\\" diets, because they make you lose weight at first. But after a time, they stop working, and the moment you go off, you gain all of the weight back. I was on this same diet 8 years ago. After studying nutrition, I know that limiting yourself to only 500 calories a day is NOT healthy. It intentionally deprives your body of the basic requirements to function for the day. I remember the fasting days always left me feeling tired and deprived. Several years after I tried this diet, I chose to do my own research on healthy eating. I figured out the foods that are the healthiest, what my nutritional needs are, and used this to craft my own diet plan. Since then, I've lost 60 pounds and kept it off. I eat three full meals everyday, and  a good snack. There is enough room for me to occasionally indulge without undoing everything.<br /><br />If your looking for a 'quick-fix' diet like this, you need to reassess your motives. If you're trying to lose weight, you should be doing it for your health. Don't get caught up in vanity. When you begin eating nutritious foods, you'll feel better and the pounds will come off. It just takes time. I realize this isn't what most people want to hear, but it is the truth. I'm currently coaching friends and family members, and the results have been impressive. My best friend has lost 20 pounds, my aunt has lost 80 pounds. This is from cutting out sugary, fatty junk food and incorporating more veggies. Its just common sense. Don't be fooled by these diet gurus, do your own research and use your own judgement.

B000JML90Y|3.0|Written in the typical flowery prose of it's time, the low information voter is likely to not be able to make sense of complicated sentences.  For the observant and interested, it is always a good idea to read EXACTLY what the original thinker said/wrote.<br /><br />A little hard to read, but worth the effort.
0452273331|5.0|When I read The Fountainhead I was in my mid thirties, and I though it was one of the best books I have ever read. It is not a straightforward novel or a story. Rand uses her characters to describe different positions one can take in life. Sure, all heroes are distilled to the point of the primitive: good guy who does not give up his principles when creating houses, bad guy who does, another bad guy who manipulates the weak and encourages the mediocre, and so on. As such people involved in the story are not typically human. However, through such symbolism the author expresses her philosophy of life, which I suppose is well known.<br /><br />One can argue about the methods Rand used in her work, but the essence of the novel comes through very strongly. Integrity and honesty are, in my opinion, the symbols of this text. Sure, nothing in real life is black and white, but like in visual art, where a fragment is may be given unnaturally bright light in order to make a point, characters of the Fountainhead are unnaturally illuminated in order to express their essence more clearly.<br /><br />If it was up to me I would include this book into the school curriculum.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Several people recommended this book but I wasn't sure I would read it given the topic.  I thought it would be too hard, too sad.  I was wrong.  This will go down as one of the best books I've ever read.  It's a sensitive subject and offers great insight to what people go through under circumstances like these.  I think it's great for teens to learn a bit of compassion, as well as adults.

1400069289|2.0|So let's see. A book claiming to be new, uses old and well established and well known information. Still fails to help explain the important part that is near impossible for people to quantify: how to identify the trigger for an action.<br /><br />Maybe if this book actually helped with that part a whole lot more than they do, it would have been worth the money. As is, I'm disappointed. 90% of the book is just story after story as examples, but they don't add substance to the point of the book at all. The total substance of important things in the book is like the last 10-20 pages. The rest could (and should) be skipped, entirely.<br /><br />In contrast the book \\"how we decide\\" has much more pertinent information.

This series is well written and leaves you on the edge of your seat as you watch a Marine, held captive and missing for several years in Iraq return to the US as a hero. Claire Danes suspects the hero may be something else.<br />The characters are not one dimensional and provide layers of interesting detail of lives lived around Washington politics as well as the upheaval faced in Iraq.

After 27 years our boys and Jason and he is one of the boys got on stage and played rock and roll. They showed you how to have fun on stage and kick the s*** out of music and maken you miss the way it use to be.  I could not be there but I bought the two cd's and two dvd;s  and I love it. Thank boys for putting togther one more time for me HA      SPIKE  DOYLE

B0073XM77G|5.0|I bought this movie because I remembered seeing it with my daughter when she was a child.  However once I saw it I realized how much I had forgotten.  The art and the music combined to make it a beautiful experience. And the introduction by the author was truly touching. I hope that viewing this movie becomes a Christmas tradition for years to come.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone who has small kids or who remembers this movie from years ago.

B001NLKT60|5.0|\\"She fantasized about a gasoline can and a match.\\" (710)<br /><br />Such intense suspense! The tables are turned and the search is on for Lisbeth Salander, wanted in a string of murders. With several groups looking for her, (The Millennium crew, The Milton Security firm, some thugs and of course, The Police,) her image is being dragged through filth as she is on the run to save herself. With a plot weaved in murder, sex trafficking, and conspiracy we get a more in depth view of Salander's life and how she got to where she's at. Is she guilty?<br /><br />\\"Nobody was innocent. There were only varying degrees of responsibility.\\" (583)<br /><br />I really love how this book really got up and personal with everyone, explaining just about every person in the book's backstory and relationships. When Lisbeth Salander became the main focus, that's when the plot really took off. Although this book's plot is entirely different from the first book, I enjoyed the continuity of the characters. I enjoyed how it began with a seemingly complex mystery of murder and exposure before dwindling down to a simple person connecting everything, especially Salander. There were a lot of surprises and thrills that, especially since we get to know the characters so well, rocked my emotions. That ending is tortuous and makes me want to immediately pick up and read the next book of the series. If you loved The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, then you need to read this!<br /><br />\\"Salander was the woman who hated men who hated women.\\" (667)<br /><br />First Line: \\"She lay on her back fastened by leather straps to a narrow bed with a steel frame.\\" (3)<br />Last Line: \\"He put it on the floor, took out his mobile, and dialed the number for emergency services.\\" (724)<br />-------------<br /><br />Quotes<br /><br />\\"She felt that some fundamental change had taken place or was taking place in her life. ... Maybe it was the adult world which was belatedly pushing its way into her life.

She threw a milk carton she had filled with gasoline into the car. Then she threw in a burning match.\\" (667)lization that, with her mother's death, her childhood had come to an end.\\" (120)<br /><br />\\"Lisbeth was ready.

0316069884|5.0|Jonathan Safran Foer spent three years researching our relationships to our food, of course paying particular attention to meat.  He hones in on the factory farming industry, our justifications for eating meat, and the environmental toll of this cultural habit.  He includes letters from all sides of this debate, and he only takes sides when it becomes a matter of ethics or health.  Eating Animals stands out as my favorite observation of this hot topic, because in his often impartial, but often impassioned, analysis of our meat-eating ways.  He paints a broad picture but leaves out no details.  He refuses to preach to us, but instead tells us his story and his experiences and his observations, and leaves us to think for ourselves.  If you want a definitive book on what our culture and industries have done to appease our carnivorous tastes, this is the one to read.

B002XXNSF6|5.0|Fun to watch these two characters as the make their way until Sunrise.  Sequel would work to see if they come back in six months
B004X2M3N8|4.0|I love this show for heart and the fact that in it, anything can happen. Some of my favorite episodes are &#34;The Curse of the Black Spot&#34;, &#34;The Doctor's Wife&#34;, &#34;A Good Man Goes to War&#34;, and &#34;The Wedding of River Song&#34;, but I loved most of the series. I didn't really like the episodes &#34;The Girl Who Waited&#34; or &#34;The God Complex&#34;, but that was more due to my personal opinions, rather than story telling quality, which was still good. It is here that your questions about River Song are answered, as well as where you get to explore more the dynamics between Amy and Rory as a married couple. The season's story arc of the Doctor's fate at Lake Silencio was also very well done. This is worthy addition to your video library.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Essentially left empty handed in the end. I thought more would be revealed and she would endure more from the Dominatrix lifestyle. More whips, less lovemaking but I'm sure that takes place in part 2!
030758836X|4.0|Good character building and liked the back and forth in the thought process. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B008220BLG|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A lot of people don't like zombie movies because it is all about killing and how evil the zombies are. This movie is not about that at all. It is about a zombie named R who sees this human girl and wants to protect her. Eventually when all of the other zombie find out about this human girl they try to eat her of course. But R won't let them hurt her. Once all of he other zombies see what they have their hearts start beating again.<br />I thought this was a well thought out romance and a great movie.
B000060OFT|1.0|I cannot believe I wasted my money on this. I threw it away. Very poorly made, stupid story line ( and I hate the word Stupid). I'm sure this is one movie Leonardo is regretting ever have been in.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book probably read differently for me than it would have if the author were still alive. Unfortunately that tragedy made the book different for me. Even so, it was extremely enjoyable.
B008JFUNAU|1.0|The Sam Raimi team does not deliver a film that follows the mythology found in the Oz books.  Nor does the Raimi team deliver a film that captures the darkness and scariness found in the novels.  This is sad because even the silent films from the 1910s capture more of the darkness found in those stories.  And one would expect the director of the original \\"Evil Dead\\" to be able to deliver a dark Oz film, but \\"Return to Oz\\" from 1985 retains its crown as being the best film to capture the books' darkness and to follow their mythology.<br /> \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" pays tribute to the 1939 film by following its mythology and only incorporating a few elements of the Oz novels.  What results is a film that is too light hearted with a poor storyline.  If the mythology from the books had been followed, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" would have been darker with a strong story of saving Oz from oppressors.  Anyone who has read the Oz book knows though L. Frank Baum wrote children's stories, Oz stories are dark, scary, and several of the film adaptations would receive PG-13 ratings.  But \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" ignored the books' mythology.  So for people who are looking for a fantasy that is dark and full of skirmishes, read the Oz novels and hope another film reboot will make such a delivery.<br /> After months of interviews where Raimi stated he reviewed the Oz novels as sources of back story for this new film, one would have expected \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" to be more original in its delivery and less of a copy of the 1939 film.  This does not occur, and its delivery is pretty much a copy of that film.  \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" goes from black and white to color, introduces Kansas characters that will later be re-imaged in the Land of Oz, focuses too much on 3-D aspects, and has female characters that are too passive.  One would expect the portrayal of women to be passive during the 1930s, but in the 2010s one expects women to be aggressive and to display selfreliance as they make intelligent decisions.<br /> This misrepresentation of Oz women is nothing new.  The 1939 film did a horrible job at accurately portraying female characters.  Judy Garland played Dorothy as being too scared and dainty.  It was not until 1985 that Dorothy Gale's personage was given justice by the actress Fairuza Balk.  She accurately displayed Dorothy Gale's lack of fear, ability to command others, and willingness to take risks in order to carry out her objectives.  It of course helped that Fairuza Balk had actually read the Oz books and that allowed her to accurately portray Dorothy.  All the women in that film displayed courage and headstrong attitudes while obtaining their goals.  And that is just how L. Frank Baum describes those women.<br /> Unfortunately, the women in this new Oz film are not represented in such a manner.  Most of them are represented as having to consent with a man before making any decisions.  Or they do not portray the personage L. Frank Baum describes in his novels and thus misrepresent important characters.  Particularly the portrayal of Glinda is very disappointing.  She is not as clever or as self determined as she should be and in the film she is captured way too easily.<br /> The only character to accurately depict personalities from the Oz books is China Girl and that allows her to steal the scene on numerous occasions.  China Girl is very intelligent, knows how to manipulate others so she may obtain her desires, talks back, and does not scare easily.  Computer generation of China Girl is excellent and is far above any other use of computer for the film.  Any other time computer generation is used, it screams fake.  The winged monkeys only look neat from a far away distance because close-ups depict them as too cartoonish.<br />Aside from the fact that mythology from the Oz novels does not depict the Land of Oz for this film, the most disappointing depiction in the film is the birth of the Wicked Witch of the West.  Mila Kunis acts wonderfully, but that does not help her with poor makeup used to portray the witch nor does her acting help represent the witch as being self reliant.  SPOILER: the witch is born due to a man breaking her heart and L. Frank Baum would never have written the witch in such a manner.  The witches L. Frank Baum writes about were always wicked, are independent, are clever tricksters, and are willing to kill those who oppose them.<br />An accurate representation of the Wicked Witch of the West would have involved her always being wicked but taking human form as a way to trick the wizard into trusting her.  From the onset, the Wicked Witch of the West would have been plotting to kill the wizard and would have enchanted creatures and plant life to kill him as he journeyed to Glinda.  Not only does this representation not occur, the representation of the Land of Oz does not even depict the presence of Kalidahs, giant spiders, killer crows, or killer wolves.  One wonders if those skirmishes will ever make into an Oz film.<br /> The acting for the film is good, but that does not help save the film's storyline.  Back story is given through dialogue but it is unclear about how the witches conquered the Emerald City.  The back story explains the need for a wizard to end oppression but the oppression is not accurately represented.  The audience does not know why the witches are oppressing the people, nor do they witness it, and they only see the aftermath.  There should have been scenes depicting the Emerald City in ruins and a lot more scenes displaying the people's devastation and demands for a new ruler.  But this depiction does not occur and one must actually read the Oz novels to truly comprehend why a wizard is needed to rule the Emerald City.<br /> In conclusion, the Raimi team has failed to deliver a good Oz film and should not make another.  A director and film team is needed who actually incorporate the mythology and personages from the Oz books.  This will give the films better storylines and of course make them dark with several scary scenes and plenty of skirmishes.  Until that happens, one wonders if the next Oz films:<br /><br />Will have Dorothy Gale obtain silver slippers?<br />Will the Wicked Witch of the West say her infamous command: \\"peck out their eyes and rip them to pieces\\"?<br />Will Mombi be forced to reveal she has kidnapped and hidden Princess Ozma?<br />Will Glinda use her army to recapture the Emerald City from an insurgency?<br />Will the Schoodlers capture Dorothy and her companions in order to eat them?<br />And can fans of the books truly enjoy new Oz films or will they be left to only treasure the novels and the \\"Return to Oz\\" film?<br /><br /> Answers to these questions are very unclear because it can now be declared that the latest film reboot of the Oz stories is not following the novels' mythology.  A reboot that is true to the world of L. Frank Baum would actually require a first film that tells the story of four wicked witches conquering the Land of Oz and hiding its true heirs.  A second film would depict the process of the wizard and Glinda removing two of the witches from power and founding the Emerald City.  A third film would be an adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and films that follow would keep depicting stories where the Emerald City faces numerous insurrections and invasions which require Glinda to find the lost heirs of Oz.<br /> One can hope the next Oz films will shift more into the books' mythology thus creating films that are dark and will just be teetering at receiving a PG-13 rating.  Anyone who has read The Wonderful Wizard of Oz knows that a true film adaptation would be rated PG-13.  Fingers crossed, in hopes that film will at least depict Dorothy Gale in the same manner L. Frank Baum describes her.  Dorothy needs to be a plain looking preteen or a young looking teenager who is clever, does not scare easily, and talks back with some attitude.<br /> Threecandidates come to mind that could pull off a good Dorothy Gale.  The 2010 version of \\"True Grit\\" reveals that actress Hailee Steinfeld would give justice to the character.  Her portrayal of Mattie Ross in \\"True Grit\\" demonstrates Steinfeld has the skill to assume the personage of Dorothy Gale because the characters of Mattie Ross and Dorothy Gale are quite similar.  Another candidate is actually Joey King.  Her portrayal of China Girl in \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is so good; it is not out of the question to have Joey King play Dorothy.  Finally there is Chloë Grace Moretz.  Her portrayal of the comic book character Hit Girl demonstrates that Moretz has the skill to act tough and brave, as well as be sarcastic during times of peril.  All of those character traits are crucial to accurately portraying Dorothy Gale.<br /> Only time will tell if Dorothy Gale and other characters from the Land of Oz and the Land of Ev are going to be represented in a manner that is true to the Oz books.  One can hope that if the Raimi team is not going to make such an attempt, other film makers will with another reboot.  When that happens, perhaps book fans will finally get to see the Mouse Queen save Dorothy and her companions and witness the Cowardly Lion confront the Kalidahs.  It has been one hundred and thirteen years since The Wonderful Wizard of Oz depicted these skirmishes and book fans are still waiting to see them in an Oz film.
0525958002|5.0|This autobiography is a look into the the world of Duran Duran's Bassist John Taylor..  I grew up loving this group but never knowing anything about them except what was published in Teen Beat etc,  I love the inside look at John's life, his struggles and his dreams.  For any Duran Duran fan this is a must read!

This man is fearless when it comes to trying material that is fresh and one can tell that it provides a boost and a strong joyful rejuvination musically.

B0006GQMC8|5.0|Fantastic cast featuring Lee Marvin in pursuit of Charles Bronson in a true incident in the Yukon mountains. Great action and suspence.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I really appreciated the great characters developed by the author.  Family sagas are perhaps my favorite novels.  The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that I'm not a big fan of flashback storytelling, which was the way the book was written.  But overall, I highly recommend it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|love graphics. good story.usually I skip storyline but this one is cool.drop down gets gradually harder. haven't found best fastest strategy for me yet. kind of just finding my way in time. adults and kids. probably my son will get better rythum then me.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The Battery is so hard to get in, I finally brought it down to the &#34;SOURCE&#34; and after great difficulty and some special tools the worker was finally able to get the battery in. He said he has never seen a spring in the battery housing for this type of battery in all the years he has worked with electronics.<br />The spring was the reason the battery was so hard to get in.<br />The good thing I learned while being in the &#34;SOURCE&#34; is they sell the battery for only $6.99 PLUS you can buy for $1.99 INS so that if the battery dies within 3 YEARS, you just bring it into any &#34;SOURCE&#34; and they will replace it FREE of charge, that is an awesome deal.<br />The mic works great, thank goodness, after all that trouble trying to get it in. But I had to give it a 3star  because of how hard it was to get the battery in. I know it may sound harsh, but I should not have to get into my car and have to go get help to put a battery in any thing.<br />I would have written the seller and asked for the reason for the spring but this seller  did not give you the option to contact them  here on amazon, as some sellers here on amazon do  give you the option to contact them.
B008220C56|5.0|Since this movie didn't open wide in Raleigh, nc I didn't get to see it.<br /><br />It was thrilling and fulfilling in every way!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I must say i really enjoyed reading this book. It was the first book that i really got into after high school. I found the book by chance when browsing through the fiction section looking at titles in the Fulton public library. Unfortunately I never got to finish reading it then and when i got my kindle fire it was one of the first books i got on it. The Red Pyramid involves just enough fantasy, while keeping the characters ground base. And a little mystery with a second viewpoint didn't hurt this story in the least. I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy of the Kane Chronicles. Onto Throne of Fire.

B004SEUIXS|5.0|I chose this movie because it has a cute story and the twists and turns that this movie makes it so much fun to watch.  I've watched it many times and always see something that I missed all the other times.  Excellent movie.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|This is a totally crazy movie, and totally entertaining. if you're looking for something serious, this probably isn't it.<br /><br />Russell Crowe's performance is apot-on and hysterically funny. So rare to see Crowe doing humor; usually he is ferociously serious, intense, and powerful. In this movie, he is ferociously intense and powerful, but also funny. RZA, who wrote, directed, and stars in this film has created a true Kung Fu spoof that never misses a beat or leaves the audience wanting for anything. Lucy Liu is, as usual, fabulous. If you like kung fu magic and action, you're sure to enjoy this movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|So much more intense than the first one and just as good if not better. The things  Gideon an  Eva go through throughout this book is crazy! I couldn't put it down because  I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Each chapter leaves you dangling off a cliff and its so hard to stop reading!
B000Q7Q2WM|5.0|Kill Bill, Vols. 1 & 2  - a single movie in two parts - is another spectacular achievement by one of my favorite film-makers. Done in the style of Japanese Anime comic strip action/adventure, these are supremely entertaining and wonderfully satirical movies. Every detail is perfect, from the performances by a stellar cast to the special effects and amazing choreography. Though rather violent and bloody, the violence is highly stylized and taken with the right grain of salt, funny and comical. in fact, these movies have real comedic elements throughout.<br /><br />I can't recommend these movies highly enough - though they probably aren't for the weak of heart or stomach. If you don't think you can get the joke, probably you shouldn't bother. But if you understand the genre, go for it! You won't be disappointed.

We live way up in the mountains & until I moved in there was no internet. I can't tell you how happy this made my neighbors. Music IS their life & main source of entertainment, this mountain has been JAMMIN for weeks now!<br /><br />I really appreciate the quality of the sound. It is better than ANYTHING they had on old albums, ( of course nobody here has a turntable anyway).<br /><br />Thanks Again!
B001I45UFC|5.0|Having read this series before I knew when I saw that they were a Deal of the Day for the Kindle I had to pick them up. This is a great go-to series any time you are wanting to get immersed in a fantastical world.<br /><br />Lewis does an amazing job of painting a picture with words. It's a great read for kids and adults alike. That's why it has stood the test of time to become such a classic.<br /><br />Probably the quintessential book of the series as is commonly known. The book really provides the starting point for the adventure through Narnia.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think its fun. you can buy boards to surf... thares players that are robots zombies and lots other cool stuff.you collect money to buy things. all the money you spend is only game money.  not real money. it gets faster as you go.  JUST DONT GET ARRESTED !!!!!!

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Harsh reality isn't often found, I usually don't like to hear it as books are an escape for me.  But we all occasionally need to hear something we can relate to, something we can live up to.  Something real.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|the idea is to use cgi as a tool to tell a story and this movie did it masterfully.<br /> It's a spectacle and beauty not to be miss
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome fun cool addicting and did I say AWESOME Just like temple run but in a subway station good for all ages
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loved tangled. Lots of humor and great story line. Highly recommended for the entire family
B002O3Z50Q|5.0|Though the movie does not run actually true with the mythology, it was close enough to be exciting. Brad Pitt was excellent as Achilles; David Bana's performance as Hector was even more excellent. You could see his &#34;heart&#34;.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I reward myself with Spider Solitaire ... after completing chunks of work...<br />Better than a chocolate Sundae!! THANK YOU Mobility Ware!!
0425252868|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my husband's father who really enjoyed the book and is reading it a second time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son downloaded this.  It was free, so that was great!  It is similar to temple run and brave, but it is slightly harder.  Basically you are running away after spray painting and you are trying not to get caught.  You run between, over, and around the trains on the tracks while collecting things.
B005HSL626|4.0|fruit ninjas free is extremely limited, if you own it get the full as soon as possible then the real fun begins
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 9 and 4 year old play this and love it.  They fly all over and collect coins without being zapped.  They've played it more than a few times, so in my house that means that they like it.  I have not yet deleted it on the kindle because it is one of the games played most often.
B0000640VO|4.0|I never imagined something could make me wish I knew French!  This movie was quirky but not over the top.  My only complaint is that it had nudity and overt sexual situations because I think my kids would have really loved it.  I really think they could have made this movie a bit more family friendly and not have taken any of its heart.  I get it though....  Loose French morals are the norm.
B001RIMOP8|5.0|Let me first say if you don't have a laser disc viewer than don't buy this product for it will be a wasted trip! You won't be able to see it and then you will be really disappointed. The movie Blue Thunder in Laser Disc format with Deluxe Widescreen Edition is a real classic! I suspect you could obtain it on Amazon.com in the popular DVD format. But of course that is your call. Now the movie features the late Roy Scheider who had some real block buster hits! Blue Thunder is a intense action thriller. The story line in Blue Thunder is centered around a specially modified helicopter. It is for police work, but is armed and designed to counter street insurgencies. Its makers want to show what it will do, but have to train Los Angeles Police pilot Frank Murphy who is Roy Scheider to fly and use it in order to allow it to operate in the city. From there the plot gets complicated because the military pilot and officer Murphy go all the way back to Vietnam. I will not elaborate but to say that it is a very exciting film the passage of time is very important. Again the format I have is cannot be used in a regular DVD player. It also will not work in the old 33-1/3 LP record player. You got to have a laser disc player to see my copy. But I have included Amazon's DVD alternative. [[ASIN:B0024FAG1W Blue Thunder [Blu-ray]]]
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|One of the most fun hidden object puzzle games I have played.  Very clever storyline with terrific graphics and stimulating puzzles.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this game.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|sooo cunning and devious, I can't imagine having to function at that level! A variety of selfish people are portrayed brilliantly
B008TRUDAS|5.0|After reading this book, I was surprised to learn there was a sequel.  This book stands on its own, but I was extremely thankful to have another book from Colleen Hoover to read!
0143121421|5.0|Well written, tightly focused, and elegantly plotted. \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" sets a very high standard by which all other spy novels must be judged. The key to its appeal is that the author makes you care about protagonist Alec Leamus and his descent into what looks like an ever-tightening snare. After a standard set piece to establish the milieu, the plot unfolds slowly, with no attempt to make it into cliched \\"pulse-pounding thriller.\\" The tension, therefore, is always increasing. The bad guys - if you can figure out who they are - are not caricatures but real people. And, thank goodness, the book clocks in at a succinct 225 pages (paperback). Too many novels these days are bloated and full of tedious filler, presumably to make the books look more substantial. People would buy more books if they weren't needlessly supersized! If you read just one thriller in your lifetime, make it this one.
B001GA1RFA|1.0|I tried, and tried, and tried to get into this book by John Green, but I just didn't could do it.
0451239377|1.0|I bought \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" because it's hailed as one of the great thrillers of all time. I had just read \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,\\" which was incredible. Unfortunately, I found \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" to be stiff, tedious, and pedantic. I could care less if anyone wanted to get rid of the pompous Charles de Gaulle. Reading this book made me feel as if I were in an overheated college classroom listening to a lecture by a history professor who was enraptured by the sound of his own voice. It was just one long information dump. Sorry, but I'll stick to Ian Fleming and Raymond Chandler.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed Slammed and Point of Retreat a little more than Hopeless, but you should not turn your nose up to Hopeless.  Colleen Hoover is a great Chick lit author.  I can't wait for her next book.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Not only is this CD a collection of truly exquisite music, but the case is attractive and eye-catching. The music is relaxing and breathtaking- James Horner is an admirable artist in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Additionally, the sellers of the CD were very flexible and willing to work with me to make sure that upon request, I receivedmy order as promptly as possible. I am very satisfied with this product!
1469259192|5.0|Great prices and and a Great book it kept my interest , I was concerned about getting it in CD but it was perfect!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I love it, it's very confortable, it has many compartiments for any kind of lens, camera and accesories, it's strong, and have a great color!!!The price is amazing!!!
0670026182|5.0|I was given a copy of What Katie Ate by a dear friend as an unexpected birthday gift. That was in November 2012. I have to admit that I haven't yet \\"used\\" it but have thumbed through it many times bookmarking the (many) recipes I wish to try. I have started on-line shopping for those ingredients that are uniquely Katie in anticipation of producing many of her beautiful recipes. My favourite \\"put it out for all to see in the hope they think I can cook that well\\" cookbook.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've read this book five times and it has never stopped inspiring, nor bring tears to my eyes. This has got to be my favorite book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love Amazons customer service, they are very attentive and kind... I like how they stand behind their products and sellers...quality merchandise ...
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a great game, and it has given me something to do, after I just had surgery. This gives me something to look forward when I have nothing to do.
0743270754|5.0|This book is genius, I can't put it down. Many hours of research went into this book and you can tell. So well written and easy to follow
0071762345|5.0|This book is not only a great place for someone to start for a holistic approach to a social media strategy, but also for those who have an existing strategy and need to reevaluate its success. I recommend this book to all businesses who incorporate social into their marketing strategies. Whenever I am struggling with a client I love having this book around so I can reference the high level basics of a great strategy and the steps to stay on track.<br /><br />The action items at the end of the chapters are great! This is a social media practitioner's must have in their resource library.
B003PIS5XI|5.0|There is nothing more I can say that the subject line does not already say except .... &#34;The last starfighter is dead...&#34;
B005HSL626|5.0|Well designed with good graphics and fun upgrades to change the style of blade you slice the fruit with. Are you a NINJA?
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Finished all 4 in less than 2 weeks, I could not put it down! Amazing story, great characters. Way better than the TV shows plot.<br /><br />Only con is I am eagerly waiting for the 5th book!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game that has good graphics and has extra stuff you can buy the more coins you collect during the game.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the most emotional books I've read. I was very moved.  College Hoover is an excellent author. It was very hard to put the book down. It's again must read
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|To continue the war with the evil piggies where ever you go it helps to have this app and it has tons of levels to battle your way through.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is extremely addicting. I actually love the time limit per game of a single minute since you can get a few games in even when you don't have much time to spare. Also like the sound and music. Nothing worse than addictive gameplay and annoying music, but this is nice enough to listen to, yet benign enough that you can still concentrate. Great game and I highly recommend it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is fun to play minecraft on a tablet but when no you can't connect with more than the people directly on your wifi with Minecraft the pocket edition it kinda limets the fun.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|This book kept me engaged all the way through. I was disappointed once the author revealed what happened to her sister and who had done it... didnt seem to quite add up. Book ended with a huge question mark.
B009X010RU|5.0|This is the second Marware case we have purchased for a kindle (our second kindle) and we are more than happy with it.  The stand is perfect for reading or playing games on the kindle and the shell protects both the outside and the screen when the kindle is not in use. Easy installation (it simply clicks in place) and reasonable pricing make this a must have item.
0062082353|5.0|I read this book within 2 days, I simply could not put it down. Chris and Taya's account of their experiences during his service is filled with raw emotions that will inspire you. Chris Kyle's bold accounts of his time at war is both motivating and moving. His humor throughout the book lightens the mood, and illustrates the strong yet soft side of his character. I applaud his efforts and achievements he received both on and off the battlefield, and I also raise a toast to his wife for her courage to stick it out with one of America's finest warriors.
B0086700CM|3.0|Its a fun app to play but it lags from time to time which is a pain. Other then that it is a entertaining game to play.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I saw it when it was in the theaters and I knew I would purchase it and I liked it just as much watching it at home.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE pinterest. I can't put it down once I start. This app worked wonderful, no problems so far. I would recommend it to anyone that likes pinterest.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I liked this book but I found it slightly depressing. The weight of time seemed to constantly press down on me as I read it. I am guessing this was intentional given the subject matter.<br />Not my favourite Stephen King novel but still worth reading. It did drag a bit in places but finding out the ending was such a tantalizing hook right from the start that I persisted.<br />The insights into late 1950's/early 60's US culture and politics were certainly interesting enough to make it worth reading it for that alone.<br />You will like this book if time travel and all it's potential repercussions interest you, and if you want a new perspective on events leading up to JFK's assassination.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awsome you can groom your horse and its just a blast you should sooooooo get it you can also take pictures of your horse.  Love,kkburrisrocks21@gmail.com
B007TK77QE|3.0|I found this book very easy to read but at the same time filled with unpleasant characters that made it hard to like. You do form attachments to some of them by the end but it is very tenuous.<br />You will like this book if you enjoy reading about people's petty problems and the day to day minutiae that fills their lives. It reminded me a bit of the feeling you get when you drive past a car accident, you know there might be something horrible coming but you can't help but look anyway.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game will keep you entertained for hours. definitely not just for kids with all the things you must keep track of!
B00003CXA6|5.0|From the begining to the end. Great Movie! I would recomend it to any Civil War buff. Very Entertaining. A must see!
B005BDZN62|5.0|I love this movie since I was small. Got it right on time. I can put this on while the grand kids are here. It teaches them good basics to music. They loved it too.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|A lot of people who grew up listening to Nsync and the early years of Justin's career may be a little disappointed because this album is definitely a change from his old pop days. Really we saw this coming. His sound since he left Nsync has been a complete contrast of what was done while being with the popular boy band. He's more R&B influenced than pop.  This album goes a little deeper in that transformation. This album is a hit! It just may not be a hit to those who were use to some of his old pop radio friendly singles. He took a risk with this album and i can respect that. I already look forward to the 2nd album dropping later this year.<br /><br />Standouts<br />Spaceship coupe- This song is absolutely amazing.<br />Pushher love girl<br />That Girl<br />Let The Groove Get In<br />Mirrors<br />Ocean floor<br />Suit & tie (i love this record regardless of what others have said.)
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game would be solo much better if there were not so many glitches. sometimes I will be running and ill just fall right off the map. this game is rediculous.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Even without buying the in game currency, this game is fun.  It reminds me of the old Jurassic park sim game I used to play on Xbox.
B008LFY6NI|1.0|Google Nexus 7 owners beware. Opens and then closes immediately. What a waste. Money down the drain. My son is very upset.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|This book, just like his blog has a ton of encouraging words for entrepreneurs. I bought the book knowing that it was a collection of his blog posts.<br /><br />I'm not the type of person that likes to go back and read old blog posts... but in this format making it the \\"best of\\" type, makes the content (at least in my mind!) new and fresh. If you buy it with that understanding, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.
1451613512|5.0|This is one of the most interesting books of US History I have ever come across. There are sooo many facts of, often unflattering, but still very interesting history, from our recent, to our distant past, that any history lover, or any one interested in just something a little different about our past would like to know. First of all, do not be daunted by the utter size and thickness of the book. It is divided in to chronological chapters, starting just around the time World War One started, around 1913, and encompassing such interesting phenomenon as the development and deployment of the first Nuclear weapons toward the end of World War Two, up to the Red Scare of the late 40s and early 50s, the assassination of President Kennedy, and all of the political fall out that followed, with the Viet Nam War, during the LBJ administration. All of the important subsequent US Presidential administrations, including that of Presidents Nixon, Reagan, and both Presidents Bush are also extensively covered with many, many interesting, and, to some, I am sure, inflamatory anecdotes, that, nevertheless, should probably be read about and known about. All in all, I would highly recommend this work, though maybe to be read, and enjoyed, in its full extant on more than one period of time, to maybe become an important historical tome.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Tried out the Hello Kitty Cafe.  Enjoyed playing this game.  How can you not love anything that is Hello Kitty.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|Full of details and plenty of examples for a good use of this difficult verbs for non-native speakers. one of the best guides I've used in this field. Excellent for English teachers and advanced English language learners.You won't regret buying it!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Have been watching Bond for 40 years and this one blew me away.  Have seen five times now and still see something new each time.  if you have not seen this yet....get it and strap yourself in.
B0031R5K68|4.0|Although I admit Angels and Demons is my favourite,  I fairly recommend this one.Quite believable and difficult to put down.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Listening to The 20/20 Experience made me realize why there isn't anyone like JT. Here are three things that this album tells us about him:<br /><br />- He doesn't follow music trends or copy anyone's style, definitely a leader in the music industry<br />- The music he's putting out is the total opposite of what's been on the radio (EDM), he isn't afraid to try something new<br />- He's brining retro back. There isn't a better way to describe his style right now: retro/sexy/classy/real<br /><br />Props to him for not using EDM beats or auto tuning his voice.<br /><br />Honestly since this guy burst onto the scene, I can't think of a single bad thing to say about him. JT is one hell of a singer, and a great role model for people's of all ages. I wish I could say that for more artists out there.<br /><br />Best track: Blue Ocean Floor
098555780X|5.0|I need step by step instructions when building, creating and or assembling stuff and this book gave me that needed step by step directions.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|boy makes your eyes feel like they are rolling. This is a fun game. try it play and roll with it
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is so much fun to play. But at Level 8 the bar froze on the objective for 500,000 lifetime coins, so even though I have more coins than that it doesn't register so I can't move closer to the next level. That's really frustrating.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|I read the Percy Jackson series several years ago so when I got around to watching the movie I had forgotten some of the details. My 4th grader is now enjoying the books and liked the movie
B00B99KJR0|3.0|I was playing on my Kindle Fire, was enjoying the game. Great game, btw, even though I am not a fan of match-three games. But on level 4, the game began using so much memory to run that it caused the game to freeze and my Fire to crash. Uninstalled since obviously I won't be able to continue playing.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|What a great movie! WE love Densel Washington and he did a great job. The scenes and stunts were awsome
034580404X|5.0|I totally enjoyed reading these books, am very glad that I bought them through amazon, they arrived quickly and I was able to start reading right away.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. What I think is the best part is being able to tide on top of the trains. My favorite version is defiantly Rome it is so amazing. I recommend this free wonderful game to every body. Another good part is being able to challenge your Facebook friends.
B0009F2EPU|5.0|I have these productions on both tape and laser disk, and have watched the lasers many times. Nonetheless laser disks can go bad with time, and this set may not always be available. Some people might criticize the costumes / lighting / staging. However the principal artists are top notch. A few of the earlier recordings could be considered boring; this is not one of those. The last DVD of &#34;Making of the Ring&#34; is interesting; it is the &#34;icing on the cake&#34;.
0786962984|4.0|For the price the game is a great starting point for those who want to try out a fantasy/RPG boardgame. At this point I'm a videogamer but have never played anything beyond Cranium, Monopoly, Phase 10 etc for board/card games. The first night I got this my roommate and I played this for nearly 3 hours (2 player game) and loved it! It seems a bit confusing/overwelming at first but once you figure it out, the game is simple and straightforward with the outcome relying solely on dice rolls and some minor logical strategy depending on what class you choose.<br /><br />For ~$20 this is a must buy for any fantasy gamer who wants a fun, fast 20-30 minute paced game. It can even be played solo!
0887307280|5.0|Every business owner should look at this.  Great concepts to put to work!  I recommend that all entrepreneurs implement these strategies for long term business success.

B007EDYN36|5.0|Kiss was a phenomenon, but Peter Criss is phenomenal! What Peter has to say in this book is significant. He is and always will be one of the elements that made Kiss magic. Read this book and be enlightened many times over!

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is the ultimately awesomely  most coolest thing that I have ever seen in my life of awesome stuff and things like that any way !!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061122416|5.0|I just re-read this book for the first time in at least 10 years, and I can't believe how much more it meant to me this time. I loved it so much that I immediately bought a copy for my mom and am reading it aloud to my best friend. Highly, highly recommend!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I never wanted to leave Guernsey and would love to know what happens in the lives of those I came to love. Laughter and tears both in this wonderful book. The audible edition is one of the best audio books ever because the narrators really made the book come to life.
0345803485|5.0|I never read. Let alone a romatic book. Way out of character for me. But every one kept telling me to read this book. So i took a chance. Not bad.
B003IKMR0U|4.0|A good game. Risk vs reward is about the only educational value offered from this game. Fun nonetheless, and quick games make it easy to play whenever you have 10 extra minutes.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Excellent tv series for the whole family. Great stories and acting with beautiful scenery. Great to see the whole season in one set.
0064430227|5.0|What a wonderful book.  I gave it to a one year old whose parents remembered the series and I knew he would hear the story.  I only wish it had been in hardback because little one can easily tear the pages.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This series is one of the few I will buy to finish the story.  I  couldn't stop playing it at all.
B003UESJH4|4.0|No comments other than it was a great show. I cannot say enough good things about it. That is all.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game. If u like building city games this is a good one! I really enjoy it. So give it a try.
B00B7IJBUY|2.0|Everytime I sit down to write this review, I give the album another listen and I change my mind. I was so disappointed with \\"Circle\\" and HAND albums that I really wanted to like this one. The lead single \\"Because we can\\" is just a rewrite of \\"We weren't born to follow.\\" Fans who have stuck with this group this long deserve better. The next few tracks almost put me to sleep. They're ripping off Daughtry (even stealing his song titles). I enjoyed \\"Amen\\" mainly because it sounds so much like Jeff Buckley's \\"Halelujah\\" that Jon's been singing lately. \\"What's left of me\\" is part two of \\"Who says you can't go home\\" but an inferior version. The album closes with \\"The fighter\\" which is a nice acoustic ballad but still doesn't redeem the rest of the junk on the album.<br /><br />I'm still a fan of most their pre-HAND material but I won't be listening to this album and I won't be shelling out $150 for concert tickets until the put out better music.<br /><br />Now, if you're disappointed with my review (or even if you agree), go listen to Richie's new album \\"Aftermath.\\" http://www.amazon.com/Aftermath-Lowdown-Richie-Sambora/dp/B008SVFX96. Richie is the band's creative genius and a better singer than even Jon. Don't get me wrong, Jon's a terrific businessman and a solid stage man, but he lacks the creativity to turn the page and create memorable music. Jon hasn't written anything good since \\"She's a mystery.\\" My guess is that Richie wasn't too involved in \\"What about now.\\"  It shows! Two stars.
B00A2H9LK6|4.0|While Silent Hill Revelation is not as good as the first movie, it is still an enjoyable film!!! Considering the budget they had to work with, and pushing once more, the 3-D craze, the movie looked good.<br /><br />Although a lot of hardcore fans find a lot to dislike, I found it quite enjoyable. You have to realize that this movie is going to be different from the game. There are changes, as is with anything that is transformed from its original platform, whether it be books or games, things change. If you cannot accept differences, then don't watch it. You'll be disappointed if you're expecting a perfect representation of the game.<br /><br />That being said, good movie. Good effects, even with the budget they had, and really good casting! I LIKED the changes, and I hope that you like them as well.
B000BISBDY|5.0|What a bargain! A lengthy, good compilation of Cash hits for one low price. Excellent value and just what I wanted.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|1 word Awesome. Word of mouth and got over the whole thing is that the whole week was a lame duck and got over the past.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|Well I have been intrigued by the Lincoln Lawyer series and so I bought this one ... and Mickey Haller crosses over to prosecute (along with his ex-wife) a scum that was released on DNA evidence.  Now we all know that people are convicted wrongfully but in this case they have the excuse.  SO ... the bilk of the action is courtroom drama and on and on ,,,, and as a rater stated earlier here ... that by the end of the book he felt that he had wasted his time,  I was disappointed.  Not Connelly's best effort at all.  Somewhat entertaining but man oh man ...the ending just kind of left you saying \\"Thats it??\\"
B007W8S2MG|5.0|All around awesome game in every aspect. If you're a RPG fan, and have a Vita, this should be a no brainer.
B004Z1896C|5.0|This is the first Rory I heard back in the early/mid 70's.  Owned the vinyl back then.  Finally got a couple of DVD's of Rory and couldn't resist getting the old album once again - I truly do believe he is one of the best axemen ever.  Worth the money and then some.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game I a a fun and playful game which I love playing on I find it interesting and have lots of fun playing on it
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|interesting mix - fun to find/hear new Jimi.  My bro-in-law is a Hendrix worshipper - his take - 5 thumbs up

B000FCK65W|5.0|My favorite childhood story. So beautiful. Helped me grow up, in a way, while still being able to be nostalgic about my youth.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|One of the all-time best Christmas movies made.  Can't be done with Christmas until I watch this at least once.
B004YOEFG8|5.0|I really like images and any kind of information about the universe and this movie is like a tresor !<br />The images of the universe taken by Hubble space telescope have been rebuilt and modelized with the help of computers to create a little movie that just defies my imagination, whether you like or not images from space, it remains beautiful and outstanding...<br />Although it is still very interesting, there is a relatively long sequence on the replacement of a Hubble space telescope part, but beside this the movie is great and has good sound effects.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Really nice item, awesome movies, beautiful packaging, good extra content, amazing pictures book. Hurray for Christopher Nolan. Holy Movies Batman!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|for once a true story or accounting of a real american hero,its a damned shame how his life ended my heart<br />goes out to his family and loved ones,yes he was hard core ,yes he pushed the envelope maybe to much<br />but I owe my freedom and much more to men and women just like him.
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|I really enjoy the concept in this book of love as a disease and a society based on that premise. I love how the author includes the bits from this societies books at the beginning of each chapter. I think that was a great way to make the society more dimensional. This book kept my interest and left me really interested to continue the series.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This is by far the best slender game on the kindle, but it has a few setbacks that if it didn't have, i would rate five stars. 1. This game has a night/day option..... No! Keep it original! Drives me crazy! 2. Unless you play this game on hard, it doesn't scare you at all. I would get rid of the all of the light because you can see slenderman from a mile away, put the flashlight in! 3. Wish it had the original moment when slender finds you with that big THUMP! Then static, and the little scream in there to. Overall, an average game.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I enjoy the concept that these books are based on. I think this one was a little predictable, especially the end, and the characters are not as dimensional as they seemed in the first. But I enjoyed it and it did keep my interest all the way through.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|This has been my favorite movie since it came out.<br />Romantic comedy that just makes me feel good when i'm watching it.
0517548232|5.0|Explains common falicies in economics in a very simple way by telling simple stories. It's amazing how long ago it was written and still you see the same falicies rehashed in national and local politics over and over again. It's easy to listen to.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Not so great, long and sometimes dull. The ending was some what of a surprise, so whats next.  I really do not care for Daniel Craig...
B00B99KJR0|5.0|this game is so hard to put down..great game to play..great for passing time away with something fun to do
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|This turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />I had seen the adverts of course and as someone who grew up during the 70s and 80s they naturally appealed to me. But they really didn't give any indication of plot or characters. So I wasn't sure exactly what to expect. And Disney's track record with computer animation is not nearly as good as that of Pixar.<br /><br />In this case though they hit the ball right out of the park. At it's core we have a simple story about learning to appreciate who you are and what makes you special. A traditional kids movie theme that is wrapped up in some traditional children's humor. But underlying that we also have references that only the adults will get. Games that we might have played, characters we might have recognized. And a great joke about some of the sillier back stories that game characters are given.<br /><br />And if that isn't enough the movie gives a genuinely heart breaking scene where Ralph destroys Vanellope's dream in (he believes) and effort to save her. Throw in one of the most unlikely romances since Donkey and Dragon and you've got an all round good movie on your hands.<br /><br />While the animation style is not as distinctive as say Hotel Transylvania, it isn't bound to realism due to it's video game setting. And there are some lovely nods to older video game animation styles along the way too.  Plus Sugar Rush has some course elements that would look right at home in a Mario Kart game.<br /><br />All in all great fun for the kids and entertaining for the adults as well.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|App won't install on my Kindle Fire. An error message keeps coming up right at the end. I'm glad this was free
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is a GREAT album. I cannot emphasize this enough. Every song is beautifully sung, he had a hand in writing all the songs, I cannot stop listening to this album. It is a mixture of music and genres and it is beautifully done. I recommend this to anyone who loves music. His voice is magical. I look forward to his future works.<br /><br />Most of the time i only like a few songs on an album, this is one of those rare albums that you can literally listen to each one, over and over. Trust me you wont be disappointed!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Like the challenge of 80 puzzles with new challenges along the way! Fun game for free.  Blah blah blah blah
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Picks up old threads, starts new ones. Instinct vs. institutions. (Now they tell me ten more words required. They're these. )
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this its so much fun....but I recommend a stylus. It makes it much easier to do. but its extremely fun.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I have read this book about ten times now and still find it enjoyable. If you want my personal opinion you should read the first part of the series to understand what is going on.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Story of two teenagers who despite their great differences truly love each other and want to keep one another safe.  The excitement never stopped as I made my way through this book.  Just when I thought I had things figured out, the author would throw in another twist.  Great reading!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I loaded this once - told me to update - which I could not. Deleted it.. Check'd out many other weather apps... all not very good - didn't do everything... Came back to this app - which is work'g great & does not need any updates @ this time...<br /><br />So all in all pretty good... weather, temp, advisories & other parts of the county & world - So Yes I am pleased!!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|The writing seemed so true to life it made me wonder if this book reveals the reality of living under Communist rule in the USSR.  It is a sad tale of a man seeking to do the right thing, yet I was heartened by the characters and their life-and-death decisions.  Couldn't put it down as the action kept coming and coming.
1451695195|4.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, a Neurosurgeon, relies on science and technology to guide his life until he becomes gravely ill and faces the shadow of death.  When the doctor contracts a very rare brain infection that throws him into a coma, he learns that  in his unconscious state, he has actually entered a spiritual realm that reflects a highly developed sensory experience where sounds are magnified and darkness is visible.  In this floating dream-like existence, Dr. Alexander experiences a gentle peace in a place of exquisite beauty where time is non-existent.<br /><br />While Dr. Alexander professes to be a believer, he indicates that when his patients  have recounted their near death experiences, his belief in a \\"heaven\\" has always been a vague assumption in a spiritual world beyond.  However, after regaining consciousness, Dr. Alexander realizes that he has been given a gift to share with others, namely, the knowledge that heaven does indeed exist.  He wants us to know that death is not the end, but it is the beginning of a journey surrounded by peace, grace, and love.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Its hard to beat the original first movie.<br />But CD is a continuation of the theme.<br />SCRATE is the *as always* the funniest character of them all.
B004SBULWE|4.0|I've used ATK for a couple of years now, and it is really a breeze. Set up which apps to stop, which to allow, and you're done worrying about it. It will flash a little line telling you killed some apps, the interval is set in options as to how frequently it kills the apps. I honestly believe it is a pretty great battery saver. Highly recommend it. Its free and does a good job...how cool is that?
B001B1UO6W|5.0|Child's Play is the best movie to watch the first chucky movie to me it's better then the bride and seed of chucky those are too comedy like. Child's Play is meant to be scary. This is a classic film. It was reasonable priced which I am amazed if I bought this in stores it probably would be 20 dollars.
B009ME47H2|4.0|I work in law enforcement. I always have my phone with me. Back in the day, we had little pocket cassette recorders, in case we needed to record conversations for evidence. My phone is much less conspicuous, and more accepted. Its easy to turn on the Easy Voice Recorder and let it run when dealing with suspects, informants, or unruly citizens. While I'm not sure that application was intended for this app, it sure works well.
B00006FDCD|5.0|It was a good movie... Tim Curry did a good role playing Pennywise. It's a long movie but I enjoy watching it all the time. I love many of Stephen King's movies.
B0002CVQCW|1.0|I keep getting an error.  Never had problems playing a DVD on that player. Just wasted my money. Hope I can get it back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and gives you something to do when you are all alone and bored and is free that needs no WiFi network.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I bought 3 of these within two different orders, and for saving the cost of an International Shipment I decided to wait a couple of weeks until some friends come by to visit me. To my regret, I had troubles with all of the 405CX watches. We bought one for each one of the buddies I usually go running with, but we all have to go/file a claim with either the Garmin US Tech support or to our local Garmin Tech support office here in Argentina.<br /><br />One never turned on and Garmin US was willing to replace it. Regarding the other two, the issue was with the touch dial -impossible to use-.<br /><br />I would seriously consider finding another option before having a Garmin GPS watch again.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I liked this movie, but can't help but be disappointed that so many liberties were taken with the true events. I understand it's a movie and not a documentary, but functionally this is the version of events that many people will retain and rewriting things does a disservice to history.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved the movie. The only negative thing I can say about it is that the beginning was a little slow. Martin Freeman was perfect for the role. Like other reviewers, I'm going to wait until the extended edition comes out.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|A very informative, entertaining and believe it or not enlightening insight into the life, music of George Harrison. Some excellent interviews with Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Eric Clapton, Tom Petty, Ray Cooper, son Dhani and wife Olivia. One of the few Blu-Ray/DVD's one won't get tired of watching every now and then. If only the 1991 (at least one of the full concerts) tour of Japan he did with Eric Clapton would be released on DVD and or Blu-Ray, might complete a collection of George's work.
B00BG08FKK|4.0|If you are expecting full versions of the songs, you will be disappointed as many of the same content cuts on songs that appeared on the highlights disc reappear here. The good news is of course is that the bulk of the missing songs from the highlights disc appear here and its still a beautiful execution of the material.<br /><br />However the issue of not being able to hear the full score outside the movie remains.
B00B23O96A|4.0|A mix of reggae, blues, ballads, bit of rock,country, nostalgic songs your grand parents listen to, couple of originals thrown in. Eric has gotten to the point now where he is making music that pleases himself and perhaps the fans who still enjoy listening to him, not making music for the sake of the record companies bugging him about where is the next &#34;Layla&#34;, so they can cash in on the big sales. Listen to it a couple of times before you get too critical, you might like it. If anyone gets the chance, go see him on tour this year while you can as he has announced he will stop touring in 2015, when he turns 70. So far at the start of the tour he is only doing 2 songs from this cd, perhaps as the tour progresses he may add more.
B00BUAEYVK|3.0|Not the best of the 5 but, no dog. After all what's it all about, blowing up s***, killing scum bags and yippie chaia...
B001B2CPH2|5.0|I have seen this movie multiple times but i still love it. it never gets old. Has some amazing actor as well. :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's nice to have a calculator on the kindle so I don't have to grab my phone or go to another room if I'm using my kindle. It has everything I need while playing on my kindle.
B000UJ48UO|4.0|Amazing cinematography, good choice of cast.  As with most of his movies, Kubrick tells the tale his own way and doesn't worry too much about historical accuracy.  Several of my friends who have gone through Army, Air Force, and Marine recruit training scoff at some of the technical details in the first part of the movie - but they all agree that the movie is powerful and evocative.  If you are a fan of Kubrick's, you will find much to appreciate (though maybe not enjoy!)  If you are looking for another &#34;Platoon&#34;, maybe not so much.
B006ZN7KMM|4.0|No lo he terminado aun, es un buen libro para leer por ratos, historia por historia. Una buena manera de aprender un poco de historia de una forma entretenida
B000U1ZV8K|3.0|We were not prepared for the language in the directors cut.  Was not what I replaced that was on VHS
0385349947|2.0|The edges of the pages of this book are very ragged looking, which gives a poor quality appearance to the book.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Don't waste your time trying to install, while it is free, you can't get it. I'm sure when it is no longer offered for free, the issue will disappear.
B002W5UVSM|4.0|A quick read with authentic dialogue that added authenticity to the characters.  John Kennedy Toole's story is a must as a companion piece to Confederacy.
1616550414|5.0|Great discount from Amazon first and foremost. This hard covered book is the type of quality you would expect if you enjoy everything Zelda Lore, with colorful illustration and deep lore that attempts to best explain the history of Zelda and it's inhabitants.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story kept  my attention, so long as I suspended belief and reality.  A different kind of book for John Grisham.
B00A6N8YTU|2.0|Don't waist your time or money ! I wanted to watch this so bad ! I'm upset & lost money on this dumb movie ! I don't want to give it away but the ending is the best part . Then they rewind it & end up doing 2 endings ?? They should have stopped with the first one ! That way I could have said the ending was good ! There are some good actors in this movie. They do a wonderful job at playing their parts ! If you watch it you will know just who I'm talking about :) Peace
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is a CD which everyone should own.  If you saw the Oscar-winning documentary &#34;Searching for Sugerman&#34;, you'll know the story of Rodriguez.  He is inspirational and his music is fabulous.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am loving the books more than I thought I would, because it is not what I would normally read. I am hoping to find more to read that can keep me as interested.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|The start wasn't too bad. I reckon the author started well to draw readers on to the ongoing repetitive humiliating and demeaning treatment of women. Went to the end after a short time of it, and it didn't get any better
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Fabulous. Watching all of the episodes is wonderful. Downton Abbey is a series not to be missed. Buy all 3 seasons.
1452110581|5.0|Like cats, themselve, the book is elegant, hilarious and insightful.  A great gift for a cat-person.  I loved it! Yay,
B005LAIII0|5.0|We had heard that this movie was fantastic so tried to see it on a large screen but too busy with the holidays and events everywhere to get to a movie house.<br />Bought this and got it last week. I was ready the night it arrived BUT had to wait for my wife to settle down for a couple of nights before we watched it. WOW!<br />This is a fantastic movie. The story telling, the visuals, the plot --- WOW! It should have gotten more awards. Just fantabulous! That will be in our movie cache for a lifetime. The visuals are just unbelievable! WOW!<br />I haven't read the book but understand it was pretty much true to the book. Get it and watch it!
0525478817|4.0|This YA novel is sweet, wry, witty, and sad - like many YA stories, it features preternaturally self-aware and well-spoken teens (but not annoyingly so) - in this case, they also have cancer. Sounds grim, and it will probably provoke a crying jag or two, but you'll find that it isn't dark or depressing because the story is so engaging and insightful.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|It was great to see Bruce Willis back in action as Detective John McClane. I was happy to see that the story moved to another country and was now focused on John's son Jack...and that John was now seen as a dad and was trying to help his son.  It was a side of Detective McClane we have not seen before.  The action in the movie is non-stop.  It's on awesome action flick and a must see.
B00008GKEG|5.0|THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY DVD SET IS SUPERB. I HAVE SEEN LOTS OF BEATLE FOOTAGE IN MY TIME BUT AT LEAST HALF THE THINGS ON HERE ARE NEW TO ME. THE OLD MATERIAL HAS BEEN CLEANED UP AND IS SHOWN IN PRISTINE VIDEO,THE AUDIO IS FANTASTIC AND SOUNDS GREAT ON MY HOME THEATRE SYSTEM. WHEN THIS  WAS SHOWN ON TELEVISION SOME YEARS AGO THIS WAS GOOD BUT THE DVD SET HAS TRIPLE THE FOOTAGE AND THIS REALY IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN OF POPULAR MUSIC EVEN IF YOU ARE ONLY A CASUAL BEATLE FAN. THE PRICE IS GREAT AND DELIVERED WITH NO PROBLEMS.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|WOW....my husband and I really enjoyed this movie. We would rent a movie again from Amazon! Loved this one and the price was great!! :)
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful movies I have viewed.  Co-existing with a wild Bengal tiger on a rescue boat that fell off the ship that went down during a frightful storm at sea, Pi was the only survivor.  The photography is breathtaking,  The storyline was fantastic.  I  believe anyone who sees  this movie will be rewarded for the pure entertainment and the beauty of the photography.  It is one of the finest movies I have ever seen.  it could  become  a classic.
B000FC10HA|4.0|The examples are dated; but if you can get past that fact, this is worth your time and the information is enlightening and valid.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I was disappointed about a film that didn't show more of the details on this plane crash The pilot used a manuver that only he could have performed that resulted in only 2 casualties.  The drama just wasn't there.  It is a story mainly about alcoholics.  An alcoholic pilot is every passengers nightmare!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Having read all of Connelly's books this is one  of his best. It is one those books you hope won't end but still looking forward to see how Bosch gets out with his life.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|This style of pacifier ended up being our first child's favorite &#34;binky&#34;.  We were not able to attach it to the standard clips so we spent lots of time chasing it around and then cleaning it whenever it dropped on the ground.  I saw someone with a WubbaNub after my first child had given up pacifiers.  I made sure to buy two of these for my second child and he loved it.  It gives them something to cuddle and hang on to while they suck away.<br /><br />I recommend these for any parent open to pacifiers.
B0027I93U6|5.0|A new age &#34;good over evil&#34; show!  Well done by writers & actors!<br />Each episode wants you to see the next immediately.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Sometimes I don't feel like racing or guessing games, sometimes I just want mindless entertainment. Although a bit of&nbsp;strategy is required it's a game I can play with my 5yr old!&nbsp;
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I WANT A TED...Now this is a funny movie.I rented it but now I will buy it. THIS IS A MUST SEE...
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries. I am going to order all the seasons. My dvds came on time, the picture is perfect. I loved the ease of shopping. Quality product. I will shop here again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun, but sometimes it is confusing, but  I would still, recommend it, so, get it :)
B009LA1R34|3.0|CD simplón, esperaba mucho más, pero para el precio está bien.  Podría haber sido como su CD Primera Fila que es excelente.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really liked this game...it is really interesting if you like hidden object games...nice graphics and smooth game play...my kids love it as well
B003L7DK74|5.0|Off beat humor at it's best. My husband and I LOVE Flight of the Conchords. It was introduced to us by another couple, and we have been hooked ever since.
0525953590|5.0|Until Sean Carroll explained, unravelled and described the search for the Higgs Boson I couldn't understand what the subject was or what the fuss was all about. Here we have a clear, lucid explanation in plain English, of one of the most important, mind bending and difficult scientific searches in history.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|I thought it was a little slow to get into. Once the plot started moving it was nice, I like the characters but I don't know it had big events but they didn't feel big.... If that makes sense.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this series was totally awesome, can't wait for the movies, I will be there the day they opened.  The ending of this book left me happy and completed.
B000J1AGQI|1.0|This film is jingoistic bulls***. The director did nothing but prostrate himself before the sick altar of American imperialism, and deserves no respect whatsoever.
0545265355|5.0|my daughter loved reading these books, and then watching the movies.  can't wait for the second one to come out
B0051BVQFG|5.0|Fun movie to watch! Great story, wish they made a 2nd. About time someone made a cool us vs them movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this series was totally awesome, can't wait for the movies, I will be there the day they opened.  The ending of this book left me happy and completed.
0307730697|5.0|A wonderful story that shows when people believe in you, there is nothing you can't do. This is an amazing young man who beat all odds to become the best of the best. A wonderful tribute to a fallen hero who was loved by so many.<br /><br />As much as Adam was a true hero in every sense of the word. It is his wife Kelly who deserves as much credit for the way Adam was. She was his strength, his rock and bestfriend. Her undying support of her husband helped mold him into the solider he was. My heart breaks for the Brown family and all the miltary families who lose their loved one in battle. And I thank them for our support and freedom. The story real brings home how much they give for our USA.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this series was totally awesome, can't wait for the movies, I will be there the day they opened.  The ending of this book left me happy and completed.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|First time reading it and it is way different than the show. Really good I'm hooked can't wait to start reading the next one. Highly recommend it.
B00BP4SJKI|4.0|I haven't watched this in years, but after reading a Peter Pan story my kids wanted to see it. They really enjoyed it. I gave it 4 stars just because I don't think it's absolutely amazing, but it's a good film generally.
0061906220|5.0|I work at a preschool reading this book catches all 24 of the students attention! They love it highly recommended!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The kids liked it, the husband liked it, I liked it. It was unique and fun, the old-school video game references were funny, and I was impressed with the moral lessons at the end, particularly that of Ralph being willing to sacrifice himself (his life) to save his friend. &#34;Greater love has no one than this...&#34;. Good plot twist at the end that I didn't see coming in the identity of the bad guy...what else can I say that will ruin the plot =). Anyway, worth the rental price.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I thought I wasn't going to enjoy this series but I was wrong! I can't wait for the movies to come out for Catching Fire and Mockingjay. :)
B0063M22QO|3.0|As Mahjong games go, this one is adequate, but I wish there better setting options for things like high score tracking and other stats. It's just a<br />rather no-frills version of the game.
0688014291|5.0|Great price can not find a better deal anywhere. Fast deliver, and exact object requested.  recommend to anyone interested in this product.
B005HSL626|5.0|my kids love this game, i don't really get the point but they all take turns trying to beat the others high score.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I loved reading this book and, for one chapter, watching it on my computer.  Very innovative, original and well written.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|But wish there was a way to collect your money without getting on wifi. got it for my daughters kindle, but we don't have wifi so when i have time i go somewhere that has wifi so i can get her money so next time she plays she can buy more things for the cafe.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is fun and highly entertaining. The graphics are superb and extremely  colorful. The games start out easy but get much harder as the internal games progress. Enjoyable to play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|you can play about 10 times then an ad pops up before every game. it was free so i can deal with getting out of the ad to play.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this is a great product i have used it and i am very happy with the results. this product can handle just about knife.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|i love this game. and the different kinds of game play there is. i am always trying to beat my last time.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Keeps you entertained. You can continue with only winning one star but aiming for three is much more fun. The colors are sweet. Plays well on my kindle fire hd. Very happy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|my kids can't get enough. they love playing this game. they paly the levels over and over until they get a perfect score.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|Besides being the ultimate homework solver, WolframAlpha can answer just about any question dealing with anything numerical. It is truly amazing!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. I go back and redo some level to get a perfect score if i did not get it on the first time.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My grandson and I loved this movie. Very clever. Very smart. Very sweet. The writing is equally appreciated by children and the adults who watch it with them.
B0041G683W|5.0|This DVD Is beautifully done and the sound is great.  If you are a fan of Les Miserables you will love this.  I highly recommend this DVD!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Loved this...donated to my hospital for very ill patients who found great peace in watching the entire DVD set. Truly lovely.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I have to say that baby making was such a chore. I would drag my feet as I climbed up the stairs to find my wife waiting for me to impregnate her. I bought this album and my life has changed! I got my wife to let me play this during our baby making sessions. Let's just say, I am having the time of my life. I never knew that making a baby could be so much fun! The only bad part is that in 9 months I will have a kid to support along with my needy wife. Justin, keep making music like this and at this rate I will have more kids than the Duggars!
B0030V0PEW|4.0|The use of multiple problem domains, and scenarios within those domains, makes the case for wider use of checklists and professional discipline quite easy to digest. Plus, Dr. Gawande's writing is crisp and engaging, regardless of the subject matter.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great calculator dose most of what I need. Simple to use and works will on Amazon Fire and the HD.
0061950726|3.0|Since moving to the Midwest a few years ago I have often heard the orphan trains referred to in personal ways.  People my age have spoken of grandparents that arrived on the trains.  I have wanted to read about them but have found that most of the books are aimed at children or those who love hard core romance type books.<br /><br />So I was excited at the prospect of reading this book.  With the title of Orphan Train it seemed like it would be a novel that I would enjoy.  And of course I expected the novel to be set in the Midwest.  To say the least I was disappointed that half of the novel is set in Maine.  All I can think is that the author who according to the bio, loves Maine and wants to spend as much time as possible there.  It struck me as lazy that she wanted to set the story in a place she knows well so she didn't have to do much research.<br /><br />The story follows Niamh who becomes Dorothy, who becomes Vivian.  After immigrating to New York from Ireland her family falls apart and looses everything in a fire.  On the train several characters are introduced and then quickly drop out of the story forever.<br /><br />The other half of the novel is about Molly a Penobscot native American who is in foster care.  Molly gets in trouble for stealing a library book and does her community service by helping an elderly woman go through her attic to sort things out.<br /><br />I enjoyed each of the stories to a certain extent.  But neither was well developed enough to suit me.  I like for a story to tell about the place as well as the people and the time.  For the orphan train part of the story there were a few paragraphs about the places the train passed through and a little bit more about the final location.  She did get the description of the Chicago train station right.  The part set in Maine could have been set anywhere and for that reason I just wonder why it could not have been set in Minnesota.<br /><br />I enjoyed the writing and the stories, but I wish she had written two novels.  One about the orphan train which explored the events in more detail and a different book set in Maine about the Penobscot Native tribe.e had written two novels.  One about the orphan train which explored the events in more detail and a different book set in Maine about the Penobscot Native tribe.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|I love this movie!  Very dark and Natalie Portman does an awesome job!  Amazing to watch her transformation into the Black Swan
B002NJWHHA|2.0|My grandson and I watched this together and he was enthralled by this movie. We also have the AudioBooks so he is familiar with the stories of Eragon. This was a treat to see the stories come to life on the screen.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|I love this movie I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blu Ray.  I am beginning to buy all my movies in Blu Ray.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|MMe and my 7 year old daughter watch this movie all the time--it's so cute!! I like the first Tinkerbell but I LOVE this Secret of the Wings one the best!!
B004ZJZPZC|5.0|I enjoyed the movie liked it very much I recommend it to anyone who loves abba or musicals.  Great Show.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I have been steadily playing this since downloaded it.  The graphics are nice and it loaded easily.  Will love this while waiting at the doctors.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Always good, Van does what he does best. Doesn't really matter what he sings just that he sings.  There are some great cuts on here.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|This is my new favorite show! I even had my teenage sons watch a couple of episodes with me, and they totally were cracking up. Zooey is a terrific comedic actress, who knew? And the supporting cast is hilarious! I totally recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of King of Queens, Friends, or Seinfeld.
1439170916|5.0|The last time I read a book this big was Harry Potter. I surprisingly enjoyed this. Thanks to this book I realized that cellular biology is what I would like to study in college (eep in a couple months!), so that i can become a pathologist or even an oncologist in later years. The Emperor of all Maladies: A Biography of Cancer takes the reader on a journey to explore the history behind cancer. The struggle to find a cure, the struggle to raise awareness, the struggle to find the causes, the struggle to define what cancer is and the mechanisms that causes a cancer cell. I definitely recommend this book to history lovers, to science lovers, and especially to those who are thinking about what career to do. It'll at least give you an idea of what to do or what not to do.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want to put it down and wanted more when I was done.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.
B000ION23A|5.0|This animated show is not only entertaining to children but it also teaches one that no mater the size of the individual if teamwork is used no obstacle is too large.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I had not paid attention until the Grammy's but this is an innovative ground breaking band. Very much has caught my ear.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|I just had to get this after my grandson just giggled many times watching that Rat.  The price was worth it, just to hear that child giggle and see him smile.
B0074EIQUG|4.0|The Black Keys influence is though out---you would think this would change the Dr. John sound but it has improved the vibe.
B00511PTWM|4.0|This is a great product and I enjoy using it on long car trips for my children's toys and games.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Lots of fun. It is helping my five year old with the concept of money and she loves the ponies. The gems required to buy some things is ridiculous, though.

B0017I1IZA|4.0|Sort of wish I could be Stephanie for a day...her misadventures are quirky and fun. Although, I would carry the gun, and spend the night with Joe much more often.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|it works.  what more can you say?  decent price too.  they want me to write 14 more words so here they are: hello hello
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This  I probably  one of the best books I have ever read by John Green. I will definitely not regret buying this book.

B00B671W6W|4.0|Anthrax has, once again, been experiencing turmoil lately.  Their longtime guitarist, Rob Caggiano, recently left the band, citing a desire to do more producing.  Then, he abruptly announced he was joining the band Volbeat.  Drummer Charlie Benante has had to take time off from the band to handle personal issues stemming from a domestic incident with his wife.  Anthrax has performed in the meantime with Jon Donais from Shadows Fall on guitar and veteran metal drummer Jon Dette behind the kit.  Whether Anthrax can, for the millionth time, regroup and get their act together is anyone's guess.  The excellent \\"Worship Music\\" from 2011 may or may not turn out to be their swan song.  Regardless of the problems, they have managed to eke out a covers EP, which so far has gathered generally mixed reactions.  It will either go down as an interesting foray in between full-lengths, or a probably forgettable anti-climax to a distinguished career.<br /><br />I, for one, think it's good, not great.  And obviously, also not bad.  It is what it is; Anthrax having fun in the studio, which they've always had a tendency to do.  \\"I'm the Man,\\" \\"Attack of the Killer B's,\\" \\"The Greater of Two Evils\\"....Anthrax always had a fun side.  They continue that tradition with songs mostly meant to cater to Joey's return to the band.  For years, he was criticized as a vocalist ill-suited to the aggressive nature of thrash, and more equipped to front an arena-rock band.  Now, Joey gets the last laugh, with Anthrax covering AC/DC, Rush, Thin Lizzy, Boston, Cheap Trick, and most ironically, Journey, the band whose singer Joey was usually accused of borrowing from the most.<br /><br />The songs are performed competently, but they don't do enough to make each one an Anthrax song.  In the past, they took songs like Antisocial and Got the Time and made them their own.  These are basically by-the-numbers copies of the originals, with the band not quite sounding like Anthrax and Joey doing some obvious sound-alike vocals.  Which still sounds good, don't get me wrong, but it just doesn't come up to the level of must-have even for longtime Anthrax fans.  Most people will have their own personal favorites, which will correspond with the original tunes they enjoy the most, so for me, TNT, Smokin', and Jailbreak are highlights.  If you're more of a Rush or Cheap Trick fan, you'll probably like those covers more.  Overall, this is worth picking up if you can get it for a few bucks, but it won't change your life if you have it or don't.  It's an o.k. release from Anthrax, I just wish they'd done a bit more with the arrangements instead of doing straight covers.d-alike vocals.

044024238X|3.0|This book is fun, funny, easy to read. A great break from all the business journalls, internet news, and required reading we all need to read (and her charachters may need to read)  you'll smile throughout.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  it is so addicting. I have never ever played a game like this.  it is so fun
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|I bought this movie for my mom because she's been wanting it for a long time. The case itself has a very nice slip cover that opens up and it's absolutely beautiful! We were very satisfied :)
B008YW5RH2|4.0|The best tennis game I played so far for a tablet. Great way to kill time. I hope there's a way to increase credit without the need to buy. :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has changed my perspective on life! I recommend this book to everyone. PAGE TURNER! It is my new favorite book.
0140067477|4.0|A decent philosophy book that teaches principles of Taoism by making examples of Winnie the Pooh characters. It seems a little heavy on drawing contrasts between philosophies which was a bit distracting. Anyway, it was a nice easy read at a cheap price
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I felt like I was there watching everything happening. I couldn't put it down until I had finished. Found myself wondering what the next book would be. I enjoyed it very much.<br />Barb
B0017KIBAI|5.0|The best controller I've played with. The cord length on these controllers is fantastic. The price on these fluctuate a lot right now which is weird but I think it is because they are getting these from Japan.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Big Dead Fan here, thinking about getting a samuri sword!! Can't get enough of this series and I'm not a horror fan at all.
B005OCFGTO|4.0|It's a no-frills box set of all the movies. The movies are not in their own individual DVD case; but all in one big case. Great price for all 8 movies!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|These are good microphones for interviews, given their wired setup. The stereo plug duplicates the channel (dual mono) so you don't get a full sound, it's always flat, which is why it should be used for voice more than anything else.<br /><br />Audio quality is good too, has plenty of volume thanks to its own phantom power, and fortunately, no background hum, buzz, or noise. Build quality is not that great, but if you're nice to it, it should last you long enough.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|i really hate it when amazon offers an app as the free app of the day without testing that it will even download, and run.<br /><br />throughout the day, i tried to download this six (6) times. not once would it download. so i have to ask, who is to blame? amazon, or the developer. because free apps of the day, it's a lottery if they will download.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Well written, amazing story of survival, very difficult to put down. Read part, and listened to a part.  Strongly recommend to anyone!4

B001HZK8FY|5.0|I am totally in love with the movie. Somehow I lost my first copy and saw this great deal with the gift set included for almost the same price.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Pruchased as a gift for wife, and she likes the songs, and being able to listen in the car without all the electronic downloading and re-installing. Good ol' CD.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I pre-ordered Season 2 after completing Season 1 on DVD.  I dont have HBO and loved the first season.  At the price that Amazon had this for it was a bargain.  I cant comment on the quality of this particular season as its still wrapped in plastic in my movie library but if its anything like the first I am sure it will be nothing short of fantastic!
B000Q6GX8Q|5.0|So much has been said about this film that it would be presumptuous of me to add anything. I will try to sum it all up in one question however.<br /><br />Casablanca is about a fundamental choice some people have to make at some crucial point in their lives. What is more  important: find love or fight for freedom?<br /><br />Rick, the eternal cynic who did not stick his neck out for anyone, chose to fight freedom. I am not sure what I would have done. Perhaps I would have chosen love. Maybe I am a wimp, or maybe I take freedom too much for granted, as I never had to fight a war to have it.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This was not a run of the mill romance novel. I appreciated the development of the characters and especially appreciated that, for once, the hero was not sexually expert and had to learn to please the heroine.
0385349947|2.0|Was so looking forward to it... Just got the book today and was utterly disappointed in its look. yeah, the book seems to be rushed in to printing and the pages are not even in the same size. what an embarrassment!<br /><br />I hope I am the outlier here. otherwise you are facing a serious quality issue...unless you tell me this is the style you are pursuing - uneven sized pages
B006RJTEIC|2.0|I suppose it was BIG in it's time. Was racy for back then. But a D movie by today's standards. Acting was just mediocre.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Very well written. Kept me glued and had a very hard time to put it down. Worth your time. Good for anyone who likes stories like Hunger Games.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's the Bible, how can you say anything negative about it.<br />Enjoy having it on my Kindle..easy to read daily.
0446547573|5.0|I am ashamed to same that this the first book of Spark's that I have read. Not disappointing at all.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game of solitaire and it is an addictive game, there are options to play solitaire and a variety of different backgrounds on cards front and back, so yes I would recommend this game to some of my friends. Oh, I forgot to say I'm playing on my kindle fire &amp; my phone and it took me less than a min. to download it to my phone !
B000W93CHC|5.0|The book may be long, but it grabs you by the throat on the first page and never lets go.  I've never read a Ken Follet book I didn't love.
B005F3DFXG|4.0|But I had to wait until I purchased a new blue ray player to watch this blue ray - and then I still can not watch the second disk, making of, because of the region formatting. The new player still will not recognize the region formatting. However I will say that it has been worth the investment. I admit I have watched Planet Dinosaur more than once. Fascinating material and superb graphics. I enjoy it throughly. I just wish I could watch that second disk without investing in a PC with a blue ray player.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|well i  watch the tv show  20/20  and lets say Justin Timberlake  isn't seeing Hugh  Downs.  when i think about Timberlake  i feel like i'm  watching  somebody who is acting a  part and not  really believing  the role.  vocally he just doesn't have the goods  and musically while the project is well polished  he simply doesn't have that kick to  make anything his own.  when i think about  Kenny Loggins, Michael Mcdonald,Darryl Hall  to George Michael  they had a  duet  partner  who allowed them to shine.  to  me if Timberlake could  get into a  power duo with say Bruno Mars  or someone it might lead him to finally finding his own voice  instead  of trying to  being a wannabe smooth R&B  singer which he only slightly mimicks  however doesn't get the soul down.<br /><br />for instance the lead single \\"suite and tie\\"  which has  a vh1 men strikes back type of production number in the James Brown for tv \\" sex Machine\\"  finds Timberlake trying to be cool  and coy  however  he comes off corny.<br /><br />and Timberland  is  never going to be in Quincy Jone's area code even if he can afford to buy a house on the same block as Quincy Jones, he just doesn't have that next level ear.  and that is what is missing from timberlake that kind of ear which would  take him away from the  karoke phase, which while as  a entertainment  factory is funny and cool on Saturday night live, just doesn't translate to a album and by the way  it doesn't take a genius to liven up  Saturday Night Live because that show should have been gone years ago to me.<br /><br />anyway  thius album has  to many long winded short idea and tired vocals by a act who just doesn't have those  kind of  chops.<br /><br />i just don't feel his approach to music is Authentic and i feel he is D W Griffth'in  his thing in regards to R&B.  his voice and music leaves  me cold and it feels very much in line with Pat Boone  much like how he rode off of Little Richard  back in the 50's.<br /><br />also timberlake ain't doing nothing thar Ginuwine  didn't attempt to do with timberland back in the 90's.  and Stevie Wonder  can see that being a broke Michael Jackson is  all flash and half the vision. if Timberlake truly wants to further his musical ideas  well maybe the duo thing might be a stroke of a wonder because thus far solo its smoking mirrors and more fog than clear skies.  his writing and vocals gotta step  up and he ain't no band leader  and no band can hide the Generic soul.  and just when i think nobody can be anymore corny than Robin Thicke  here comes this album and that wounded Lamb sounding falsetto.ng nothing thar Ginuwine  didn't attempt to do with timberland back in the 90's.  and Stevie Wonder  can see that being a broke Michael Jackson is  all flash and half the vision. if Timberlake truly wants to further his musical ideas  well maybe the duo thing might be a stroke of a wonder because thus far solo its smoking mirrors and more fog than clear skies.  his writing and vocals gotta step  up and he ain't no band leader  and no band can hide the Generic soul.  and just when i think nobody can be anymore corny than Robin Thicke  here comes this album and that wounded Lamb sounding falsetto.

B0061QD88S|5.0|What a great classic cartoon. The story of a high class cocker spaniel who meets her rugged \\"tramp\\".<br />I lived this movie as a kid and an glad to share it with my kids now.
B00AN93Q0O|5.0|Such an amazing record!!!! It's rare that I can listen to a whole LP from beginning to end, without ever jumping around or saying &#34;eh, I don't like this song that much&#34;.  But, I love every single song on Vessel!! It's like Forest's momma said, &#34;it's like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get&#34;!!! and I love that about Twenty One Pilots!!!  So many different genres of music and mixed so well together and Tyler is one hell of an introspective lyricist for such a young man!!! So much energy packed into one record, I have at least 6 favorites that are on my constant ipod rotation!!!  Thanks guys for the amazing and inspiring art!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This was Gillian Flynn's first novel, the most recent being &#34;Girl Gone&#34;.  I read Girl Gone first, then I wanted to read other book by Flynn.  I enjoyed this this one just as much as I did the other, and I am looking forward to reading her other novel as well.  Flynn is great a developing her characters in the book in a way that I feel is almost subtle.  You feel like you are right there experiencing everything with the characters.<br /><br />This was not a good book, it was a GREAT book.  If a book is ever written by Gillian Flynn, I will read it.  She is one of the best ones out there.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Fun and addictive! Recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games! Once you start it is hard to put down so go have some fun.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could not put this book down, and it was written in a way that you can't help but instantly gain some sort of sympathy for the main character because of his condition.  It's a great story of lost love and new love and all the feelings that go along with it.  I highly recommend it.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Especially is your fan of the books the extra minutes that were not in the first release of the film, were key parts in the books and I was very pleased with it.  THe only downfall is I subscribed to Amazon Prime to receive our favorite movies, dvds, and video games on release date. Amazon stated because the twilight movies come out on Saturday that I can't receive them until the Monday after.  I was very upset.  I honestly subscribed because of that receive on release date feature. I know both UPS and Fed Ex and the good old USPS (right now) alll deliver on Saturday and that was my biggest down fall about this.  I was going to go out and get a midnight but Amazon had already taken the money out of my account by then.  If this happens with another new release that myself or my son REALLY want I will not renew my amazon prime account.
0345803493|2.0|I finished it, but I don't think I'll read the third. The first book was better. At least five sex scenes were skipped over and not included in the book... I thought this was supposed to be an \\"erotic romance,\\" pffft. The sex scenes that were included were all the same. If you've read the first book and were left wanting more, read the first book again, the second doesn't satisfy. Only bother reading if you really want to know what happens with Ana, her new job, Christian, Kate, blah blah blah.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Right from the beginning as always.  Kept us enthralled.  Hope that there will be more coming.  Jeremy Renner is a good replacement for Matt Damon who was also very good.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I saw the game and how it was listed for $5 and instead it was free so I figured why not.
B007REV4T8|4.0|I like Daniel Craig as the new James Bond.  Lots of adventure.  Sorry Judi Dench will no longer be M.  Maybe Ralph Finnes will be a good replacement. There was a slight flaw on the disc, but we managed to get by it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Perfect for travel. Charges my Kindle Fire as well as my HTC EVO and Samsung Replenish as well. Well worth it!
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|I had my doubts about Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Hobbit when I heard it was going to be stretched into three movies.  After watching the first movie, I don't mind the three movie thing anymore.  I welcome the chance to explore a little more about Middle Earth, and would like to see how Peter Jackson will tie it into the first Lord of the Rings movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game. it has taught me so much abiut careing for horses and its very fun to play.
B0014JKJJI|1.0|These crocs claim to be non slip and great form restaurants! I work in a high volume restaurant and the first time I step foot In the back of house I slipped and fell! I do not recommend these!! Sending them back!
B00006JIA4|5.0|I have enjoyed Queen over the years and finally purchase an album. Having all of their hits in one spot is great.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|One of my very favorite movies. I know it by heart. Looks great on Blu-ray, you can even see Will Ferrell's crazy little vein under his eye ;) Sound is great, color is great. Movie is great.
B003M7BLOW|5.0|I love AMD, and this is a boss processor, would recommend to anyone. Love the raw power of this beast.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|gameplay is fantastic. the story was compelling and interesting. there always seemed to be something curiously engaging to do. easily one of my faves
B005721Y7Y|2.0|I wanted to watch this movie and was disappointed that it does not include close captioning. It was my fault for I did not check whether it was closed captioned or not.
B00969GFFU|1.0|I couldn't get into the book. Author is extremely long-winded. Was hoping that as I kept reading, the story would pick up. No such luck. Being in a book club and alcohol are my silver lining.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|my lillte bro love this game. He a huge fan of mine craft so he wanted to get this game too.
B0037VNX44|5.0|This Bronson guy was a character and the movie is loosely based on him.  Be warned there is alot of male frontal nudity.  It was entertaining to watch.
B005HSL626|5.0|I just love playing this game!!!!ALL DAY LONG!!XD<br />Is the best thing ever that I have play this game. YAY !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series.  Can't wait to start season 3.  Sorry I missed season 2 on the PBS.  This was a great buy.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My little bro love to play this game. All day long and am gland that he love it so much.
B007NZDES0|2.0|What an enigma. While visually it was quite outstanding, this is, afterall, a MUSIC concert. Maybe after all<br />the fancy-shmancy visual effects, they only had about 3-bucks left for the DVD sound mastering!! Only 2 sound options, 5.1 Digital or 2-channel stereo (why no DTS?). The 5.1 digital was unlistenable!!! The sound would literally<br />\\"dip,\\" as if someone was playing around with your receiver's volume control. This is what it would sound like if you were using a $39 condenser microphone. Reaches a certain volume, then lowers it mechanically, not musically. Had to use the old - but reliable, I guess - 2-channel stereo. Thus, no middle channel, no rear speaker ambiance. It's 2013, for goodness sakes.  It's like the engineer had no clue about 5.1 digital, how to master it, or what it even is.<br /> Of the hundreds upon hundreds of DVD concerts I own, this was the the runaway winner of The Worst Sound Ever.<br />The only reasons I wouldn't give it a zero rating is because Amazon doesn't give us that option, and, as I said earlier, the visual aspect was quite good.  But if the visual was all that mattered, I could have gone to a museum!<br />What on earth where they thinking when it came around to the actual sound of theDVD???? Just mind-boggling...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|It was better than the first book I would recommend it to othersbut I still think there is too much sex in it and it could have more of a story to it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A lot of really good twists.  I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down.  I recommend it to anyone who likes these kind of mysteries.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This was a very good book  It was sad but with so many people with cancer around where I live that it hits home.I would dearly recommend it to others.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I don't know how this app is because I never received it, when I look it says I purchased it but I can't find it , in cloud or devise.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It was ok and I would recommend it to others.. I didn't like all the sex in it I am sure they could have written a better story and left out alot of the sex
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the book, but I wish I could just rate it with the stars and not having to write anything about it.  I like it period.  If I wanted to write something about it should be optional.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am a Facebook Junkie! So having the app on all my devices makes my life so much happier LOL!
B008MM9630|5.0|one of the best farm games I have played! and you don't have to always be nonlinear to play. to me its better than farm story.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A great way to catch up on past episodes you may have missed.  Seeing it agin filled in some of the gaps I missed earlier.  Engaging character development, old chap!
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|I saw this movie On opening night at 10:00, but before that I had the pleasure of seeing the other Die Hard movies. What Can I say I was born in the 90's, I didn't have the pleasure of seeing the other 3 on the big screen even though I saw 4 back in 07. Now Die Hard 5 had a couple good moments but not enough to satisfy, especially as a fan. Number 1, was Chemistry between Bruce Willis and the actor who played his son. Even though I'd enjoy the actor who played his son in Jack Reacher. Many movies have good chemistry between father and son like Last Crusade and Star Wars 5 & 6. Number 2, for a movie that was only 90 min it drag and felt it was long. Number 3, How many time did I have to hear Im on vacation or You never did that for me Dad. Number 4 as a big video gamer it ripped off alot of Call Of Duty and for those that played Medal of Honor they had a guy who look like the character Dusty with a Beard, hat backwards  and sunglasses. That really made me mad. Number 5, How many windows do you have to jump through in one movie. That got so old to fast. The only part I enjoyed was when Bruce Willis was in the safe house mowing down the bad guys who were coming at him. I really wish this movie was good the trailers made this movie look good but it wasnt that good. I will get it but it will be watch only when I feel like having a marathon.It would most likely gather dust in my collection if anything. This is also coming from a Die Hard Fan.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I have been looking for a new artist, and i rarely leave reviews.  This album puts me in a relaxing mood and makes everything in my world allright.  Just what I need after a long hard day.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Every song on this album is great. I think is one of Santana's best albums ever. Anyone that likes santana's music wont be disapointed the one rocks !
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Once I started reading, I could not put it down. It's a lot better than the movie. I can't wait to read the next one.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I like this game ALOT!!  Sometimes I wish I had more time but then it would be to easy.  Great game.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|love the game. completely addicting.  there is a major problem that needs fixed. game keeps erasing my progress and starts back at the very beginning.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love hide and seek games as well as mysteries so this game is perfect. I really enjoy the fact that this is a challenging game without being frustrating. I play games to unwind and don't find enjoyment in games where you can get stuck on one thing for too long. This is so much fun to me I am just excited to play everynight. I also love the fact of knowing that there are so many games to move on to next that are from the same company. When you find a good game sometimes it is a little disappointing when you reach the end because then what? I don't feel that way this time. I am excited to finish and move on to the next one. Yay
B004HD61KE|5.0|Classic Sigma form: archaeology,  science and spies - not to mention the world is at stake! Maybe the best Rollins to date.
B00BRUYQFC|4.0|In short, the album may look like it's on the short side, but the songs actually average out to be around 6 minutes long. For me, I felt like the length of the songs were definitely a little dragged out sometimes. On the other hand, since each song is so lengthy, it almost feels like there are multiple songs embedded in each song, which makes for a cool listening experience. Overall, this is definitely an eclectic album that you will either learn to love or just hate after the first listen.<br /><br />Pusher Love Girl (5/5) - My personal favorite on the album because of it's old school/jazz feel<br />Suit and Tie (5/5) - No explanation necessary since everybody have probably heard this on the radio on a daily basis.<br />Don't Hold the Wall (4/5) - Reminded me of a mix of pop and rock that was reminiscent of JT's N'Sync days<br />Strawberry Bubblegum (3/5) - A more chill song with a nice beat but doesn't really stand out much.<br />Tunnel Vision (5/5) - Another one of my favorites that is more on the pop side.<br />Spaceship Coupe (4/5) - Another smooth song with some cool beats.<br />That Girl (5/5) - Similar to Pusher Love Girl in the way that it reminds me of an oldie.<br />Let the Groove Get In (4/5) - A song that seemed like it pulled from some Latin influences. Reminds me a little of Se&ntilde;orita with less of the pop factor.<br />Mirrors (5/5) - Probably another one of my favorites because it reminds me more of the old JT who sang 'Cry me a river'. In terms of lyrics, this one would probably also have to be one of my favorites.<br />Blue Ocean Floor - To be honest, I'm not sure how to rate this one because it's really different. This is really something that you have to judge for yourself and there are sure to be wide disparities in opinions.<br /><br />Fans who are not as excited with this album need not be disappointed. Rumors have it that JT is planning on releasing the second part of this album around November to complete the whole 20/20 experience (10 songs now, 10 songs later).now, 10 songs later).
B00B99KJR0|5.0|very nice match three game. it downloaded on my kindle fire just fine. I would reccomend it for those who like match three games
B008S80P38|5.0|The album is greate but the CD Rip it´s not abailable after purchase.<br />The album is greate but the CD Rip it´s not abailable after purchase.<br />Packaging and shiping time OK.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Without the Booker concept it sounds the same. I had it figured out before I was finished. No mystery here
B002SSUQFG|3.0|My Seiko did not come with &#34;canvas strap&#34; watchband. It was nylon. It was quite unfortunate because that was part of the reason i purchased it.
B005FFW46S|3.0|Well written, real characters, educational about human nature and a darker look into a policeman's world but not a lot of fun.  Involves a major crime and that involves people getting hurt.  not appropriate for children though it may teach you something about a child's world.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great show easy download and viewing. Having these things available on line are great for the kids and grown ups alike.
B000URDE2Y|4.0|I haven't listened to Robin Trower since the 70's thought I'd give it a try so I ordered a newer one than I had already
B005LAIIKI|1.0|First off, let me say that I previously loved or at least liked (Kill Bill Vol 2 being kinda mediocre ending to the great Kill Bill1 and deathproof being kinda weak) most if not all of Tarantino's films.  Let's face it, he pays homage (or re-imagines) past movies and genres and adds his often witty dialog and violence which in turn garners him acclaim like no other and develops him a hard nosed fanbase who will inevitably defend this movie to the bone, as racist and weak as it is. My problem with this movie is not so much the glorification of racist views and language as much as it is the fact that this is a complete work of fiction which is being treated as if it has historical merit.  If that wasn't bad enough, In an age where many black actors are pigeon holed into either Tyler Perry-esque nonsense or playing slaves I really just find it boring and cliche. Django brought nothing new to the table. The dialog which is often witty was not in many instances, especially for the black characters Jamie Fox and Kerry Washington (who hardly spoke) but was the most well written for Waltz and the charismatic villains DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson....which brings me to my next issue: The movie was sold as Django \\"unchained\\" but ultimately he was the most boring person in the film and all other roles (mainly the roles of plantation owner or uncle-TOm villain) were far more fleshed out and better written which is sad because as the main, shouldn't Django be the one we pay attention to and root for? I found it very uneasy watching this in a theater full of white people and hearing the jarring responses from the audience mostly disdain when Django (remember, the HERO) was shooting white southerners and then laughter and glee when either Candie or Samuel L's character went on a rant etc. Which to me is akin to watching Schindler's list and rooting for the Nazis. Although Tarantino touched on Nazi's and Jews in Basterds movie, he did it differently. Nazis were no doubt the villains and he made the Basterds very likable and who you were rooting for, he did not get that across in this movie.  There was a certain way he gingerly handled the Jewish plight in Basterds that he did not handle the plight of slavery in in Django. It was very ham-handed and sloppy in terms of character connection and emotion.  If the meat and potatoes of likable dialog all go to the most racist despicable villains in a movie, don't try to fool an audience into thinking this is tale where the black hero gets revenge when it is merely a showcase for your love of writing and fleshing out racist views masked as witty writing.<br /><br />I wonder if the shoe were on the other foot, e.g. he revisited the holocaust and made a revenge flick parody of that atrocity; if it would be so well received and well liked by critics and the Oscar academy. Now, I can already feel people citing Inglurious Basterds as an example and saying, well he did, but no, the tone of that movie without a doubt painted Nazis in a bad light where I feel Django was like a love letter to southern racism and slavery, often justifying it as 'the way things were' to the effect of even assaulting viewers with the N-word to excessive amounts. This is 2013, we have a black president, but a movie like this will always come along and just slap any major African American achievement or stride for TOTAL equality in the face by glorifying and justifying horrific events during the times of slavery and also becoming so widely popular and glorifying racist words and treatment of a people.  After the movie I felt as if I walked out into a sea of Calvin Candies and it was a terrifying feeling to look around and feel as if I was the only person who had this view. Surely, the reviews and media will further scrutinize and examine this film for what it is right? Well, that did not happen. The Politically correct movement of the late 90's and early 2000's has given way to a new age where now, people revel in a return to themost despicable and fiendish rhetoric and rants just to get famous. I nod to today's 'comedians' where the clever joke writing takes a backseat to shock value (which is often racist) and puts them on the map, garnering attention. Attention in this day and age is not bad or good, it is essential and the more eyes on you means that someone somewhere will offer you money to continue to be controversial.<br /><br />This is what Tarantion has/is doing at this point.
B000009HF2|5.0|I purchased this to add to my IPOD collections so I can listen while napping before a long day at work.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This takes up less space than a regular clock. Has all the features I was looking for and it comes with me when I travel.<br />I don't find the light to be too bright .  Super convenient.
B008PZ69T8|3.0|I'm sure this tape is all that it should be.............except for me.  I thought I was ordering the book on tape and not the musical album so I returned the tape unopened.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really enjoy the game. But between each deal you must exit out of the advertisements. The game itself responds quickly and has many cool features.
B006KP3XCQ|5.0|Kids love this movie, so case broken ya kinda iffy but movie working so I guess ok, just as long as kids are happy.
B009B8YZKS|3.0|I am a lifelong sci-fi fan and was pleased with this movie but rather disappointed by the fact that it was a prequel to the Halo 4 game; I had hoped it would be a movie version of at least part of the game.<br /><br />Due to the motion sickness that I experience playing most of the Halo games I don't own any of them; I don't have this problem with most other FPS games.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Love the classics! You can never beat them. Just as good this time as it as when I was a child.
B00555X8OA|5.0|In every page the conventional wisdom about &#34;rational&#34; behavior is challenged.<br />Brings very specific, deep and broad psychological knowledge, based on extensive research, to a wider audience . Pleasant an easy reading. Very, very interesting!
030758836X|3.0|I can't understand why this book is still on the best sellers list.  I find it slow and dry and am forcing myseslf to finish it just to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />Judy, Oak Harbor, WA
B000FCKBCU|5.0|As a busy professional woman who is in a field where you are expected to give your arm and first born child, I really related a lot to the main character in this book.  Admittedly, I found the concept of her &#34;falling&#34; into her situation (to be vague so as not to give away spoilers) a little unrealistic, but I liked what she learned during her journey.  It's funny thinking you know what you want is a result of not having experienced anything else.  Great read!
B004FEL6GO|4.0|A very good buy as expected came at the right time without any problem. com is such shows and I'm happy with the purchase.
B000FBFN0Q|4.0|I read this book fairly quickly because I always wanted to know what was going to happen next with Becky.  I did find that a lot of her &#34;thoughts&#34; were redundant but overall found her to be a likeable character and found the situations she found herself in pretty entertaining.  I'd recommend me this for a relaxing, quick read.
B004FEJ3VY|4.0|A very good buy as expected came at the right time without any problem. com is such shows and I'm happy with the purchase.
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|I really liked the concept of this book.  It was like a little mystery cloaked in a subtle love story.  I can't recall reading a book with a similar story line.  I enjoyed the ending because I felt it was as real as it could get given the circumstances.  I really love the way Sophie K. tells stories! Would highly recommend for a weekend in, a vacation read, or (as I do) to take your mind off of your commute!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice large numbers and easy to read. It has really come in handy when I don't have a phone nearby. It's all I need for quick equations.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW!!!  What a heart wrenching story.  I so love the main character and the story line is awesome. Your emotions are taken to the limit at times and I really enjoyed reading.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it because there are a bunch of power ups u should really make a temple run 3 :)
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|We recently watched the Marvel Avengers in 3d on our new Panasonic 50st50 and it seemed as if we were there! Of course the 5.1 dolby digital home theatre sound we used added another dimension. The 3d effects are amazing. great depth, color, clarity and a lot of out of the screen images that worked well in conjunction with the in depth images! There was very little crosstalk and the hardest few scenes to adjust to are when the focus was on someone in the background and slight blurring of someone in the foreground(opposite of what's commonly called bokeh in photography),it's only in a few scenes. The 3d is first rate.<br />The movie is exciting and a real thrill! As expected a  bit over the top(so what!) and never a dull moment and the ending left us cheering out loud! I highly recommend this for teens and up
B007CKNX28|5.0|Well, I bumped into this album based on recommendations on amazon (thanks for that!) and it is just amazing. I have White Stripes Icky Thump album and like it a lot, but somehow thought that without previous band it shall not be the same. After the White Stripes album I watched a movie \\"It might get loud\\" and performance of Jack White there is just super-mega-wow! You know what I mean if you watched this video, if you did not - please do so. So gradually I came to understanding that Jack is really an outstanding figure in rock music. I really look forward to Jack coming to my country with a concert! For acid test, try listening track 1 Missing Pieces, track 4 Love Interruption and track 7 Weep Themselves to Sleep for more calm songs and track 2 Sixteen Saltines as a more heavy one, but very nice. If you like these songs, get the album and enjoy!
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|I had initially low expectations. Some slamming doors some flickering lights, a levitating person or two. What I got was less than even that. The saddest part was it could have been a clever sequel and it could have been very scary. It had a creep moment or two but was incredibly boring. The ending was dull and stupid. The coven at the home at the end was the single creepiest moment in the entire 96 minute running time and that lasted a total of 1 second. Who can even explain the logic of running from demon possessed people but still have the courage to record every moment with your high definition camera? If you want scary, watch the first one otherwise save your money all your going to feel is cheated.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|turn off wifi and GPS while playing.<br /><br />Game is fun match-3 &amp; keeps you challenged. Nice story. No in-app purchases required, which is very nice. It does occasionally offer one of their new games for purchase &amp; is a tad irritating, but nothing is perfect.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I chose the book because I watched the movie and wondered if the book was just as good. I would recommend this book as a children's book because it's not that scary and should make them fall asleep easily
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very nice game. Runs smoothly on Kindle Fire &amp; Samsung Galaxy S II. I especially like the fact that hooking up with social media sites is under &quot;Options&quot; and that there is none of that in-app purchasing business. No invasive permissions. I got this as FAOTD, but I wouldn't object to paying a buck or so for it.<br /><br />Get the game &amp; enjoy, folks!
B00846WWVM|4.0|It's fun and different makes you think about what you are doing helping those little guys to n o t get burned
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|Don't fall for the rip off digital copy part.... buy the cheaper version. (movie only) If you have a mac.<br />I wasted 4 hours trying to get it to download. I jumped through all the hoops (flixster and ultraviolet sign ups) and it DOES NOT WORK with a mac or itunes! I contacted flixster customer support..no help there if you go looking!<br />What a rip off ...FALSE ADVERTISING!<br />AMAZON should do something about this! I won't buy another movie until this issue is resolved I'll buy it elsewhere.
B008MM9630|4.0|It is an ok game. Just wish you did not have to buy stuff with the jewels. Other than that it is ok.
B0055S348W|1.0|I might like it, if I had it!  I paid for it, but never got it.  So what is the deal? Where did it go?  definitely not to my kindle!  A little help here might be in line.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|Bought this app today (for free) because it sounded like a fun app but it would constantly download and then give an error message, download, error message, etc. Got tired of wasting my time. Don't know what that's all about. I have a 2nd Gen Kindle Fire so there shouldn't have been any issues. Whatever. If I paid for it, I'd be on the phone with customer service getting my $ back.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Well defined characters and a story true to the mythology that the series is based on.  Could not put it down!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like Minecraft but the problem is they don't have red stone or minecarts which are very important. But, this app is still worth 6.99
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married was a fascinating story about doing things backwards, getting married, then getting to know each other later.  Drinking didn't help to make good decisions.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Original review below.  After a year, this charger went belly-up.  Although the connection to the lighter still lit up and it looked like it was active, it did not charge my phone.  Was disappointed, but thought it lasted a year and I'd have to just get another.  On the first use of the new PowerJolt, I noticed intermittent phone charging.  When I unplugged the cable, the connector separated from the cable and remained in the phone.  I've had several Griffin products over the years and have always been satisfied with the quality.  Something has changed in their quality control.  Sending it back to Amazon and will avoid Griffin products in the future.<br /><br />========================================<br /><br />Bought a Griffin for my iphone-4, and when I upgraded to a 5, I bought this charger.  I've had it for about 3 months now, and it works without issue.  Much better quality than other brands I've used.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B00985E3UG|4.0|Good information, but for a funny take on all this, check out [...] Howie Weener Unclogged.  Because information and education is all that is called for, and then let the people decide.  After all, \\"its our body\\".
B004GJDQT8|3.0|I love buying stuff from the amazon store on this application. The real issue is though no video on demand and nexus 7 support. I get that amazon is in this device war with everyone else, but it's all a bit silly when the consumer looses.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|As a loyal Preston & Child follower, I didn't find the engrossing, edge-of-your-seat suspense that I have experienced while immersed in, say, Brimstone, or Still Life With Crows.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|this game will not download no matter what I do. I think that playrix or whomever is the owner of this app has it set up this way so yo cannot get it for free. ill bet if you paid for it there would be no problem installing it. not good for your business playrix.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I had really high hopes for this book because I was such a big fan of the Harry Potter series. But I can barely slog through this. I'm nearly half way through and am so incredibly bored with the story that I may not finish the book.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|AC/DC fan? This is a must have! I am addicted! Highly recommended for any AC/DC fan. Plays all their greatest hits! GO ANGUS!!
B00BWJB5H0|1.0|Unrelenting violence and gore -- giving too many ideas to budding sociopaths out in the world on ways to torture others.  Absolutely no redeeming social value.  A blight on your time.
0345529057|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book set. The shipment came in very fast and the quality of the books is great! I have recommended these books to family and friends!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read all the books in a week... couldn't put them down!!!  Should read them all again!!!  This was a download to my nook!!
B00B99KJR0|1.0|its probably a great game if i could download it from the app store. this game looks and sounds good if u could download it on kindle fire
B007IQWQ88|5.0|I have two sets, International Edition and the Original Korean Edition and I have to say that Korean Edition is far superior in sound compared to the international release.<br />Korean Edition is truly hi-end sound, thank you Korea!!!
B009AMAGQM|3.0|The people that wrote the screen play must have learned nothing from Twilight, because that first movie screwed up the ones to come..... they don't realize that by changing so many key things from the first book to movie that they will have to keep changing things in the next ones as well. They will now have to go back and explain thing that were left out or changed from the first to the second which will then take away from the 2nd books story!! If they were smart they will make a  Beautiful Creatures 1.5 and fix the broken story lines.
0374533571|5.0|An excellent story though it doesn't resemble the movie exempt that the characters are much the same (except for the father).
B000002UQJ|5.0|I guess I am a student of all things Beatle, so I thought, here's another Paul album.Was I surprised! Linda was actually soothing, and the album was  political, somewhat new for P at the time, and even later.Objectively, maybe not the VERY best P album, but compared with Kisses on the Bottom, it is &#34;Off the ground&#34;.
B00B99KJR0|3.0|this game downloaded and functioned fine on my first gen kindle<br />overall this game kept me busy for most of the day - I have the flu and have no energy to do anything else. I would love to say I enjoyed every minute but I really hate it when the levels can't be cleared unless you use powerups - almost impossible to get 3 stars on some levels so for someone who strives for it - it will drive them crazy.....and now after giving up the notion of 3 stars for every level I get to day 79.... well I can't do it - have been trying for 3 hours and I have admitted defeat... if you could blow up the brick blocks then I would have it.... but to pass that level you have to move the pieces perfectly and forget about 3 stars.... my fever addled brain cries uncle....goodluck to all who try and for those who succeed you deserve a medal.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Worth a second read. Full of emotion and action, intriguing. Fall in love with main character from the beginning and fight with her through the whole story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my kids love love love this game I see them on it every day keeping those horses in good care and condition .
B004ZJZPWA|5.0|I couldn't imagine the things I missed with the new Blu-ray I can See things I never knew were there B4! & Might I Say WoW!! ! !!

What a GR8 Movie/Flick/Treat 2 C!! ! !!
B009CF3MEK|3.0|Slow moving, well-acted, beautifully photographed period piece.  If you're looking for an action thriller, forget it.  The right picture for the right person in the right mood.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I first played this game on my iPhone and really enjoyed it, so I was glad to see it featured on Amazon for the Kindle Fire.  This game plays so much better on the Kindle Fire that I wonder now how I managed to complete it on the much smaller iPhone screen.<br /><br />It is so much easier to see the game board on a larger screen.  If you own a Kindle Fire and you like Matching games similar to Bejeweled and Call of Atlantis, then I highly recommend this game.  If you only have a mobile device for this game, then you may find that the screen size is a limitation for you.  Regardless, it functions the same on either device.  I find that having a bigger screen is more desirable for this type of game and there are plenty of levels in this game to challenge you.<br /><br />If you decide to download this game, then let the Journey begin!
0143119680|4.0|My husband bought me this book, knowing how much I enjoyed \\"Twilight.\\" The two series are not even comparable. \\"Twilight\\" is a teen series, full of repetition and long, drawn-out teenage angst. (Nevertheless, I enjoyed it.) \\"Discovery of Witches\\" is a far better read with interesting vocabulary and a suspenseful plot. The setting begins at England's Oxford University and introduces the two main characters as highly educated PhD researchers with mysterious pasts. Soon after, the reader gets pulled in by the romance, intrigue, informative info on creatures (witches, vampires, daemons), and divulgence of the main characters' pasts. I couldn't put it down! I agree with another reviewer who said the worst part was not having the sequel handy when \\"Discovery. . .\\" was over. At first, I had a very hard time \\"getting into it\\" because I didn't have the right mindset when I started reading. I didn't realize that the protagonist was a witch and the story was going to be centered around witches, vampires, and daemons (aka creatures). The first 1/4 of the book had me a bit confused about what was going on with the mysterious old manuscript housed in the Oxford Library. Once I realized there was magic, spells, creatures co-mingling in the human settings, things really started accelerating.  BTW, after I finished the book, I re-read the first few chapters, and they made much more sense and refreshed some important details.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I usually enjoy John Grisham books but this one didn't make sense...the main character of this story was so unbelieveable and unlikable.  I flipped through pages and realized I could not root for Malcolm Bannisterhim nor is he believeable...he was not smart enough or Mr. Grisham should have made him more of a success at the beginning of the novel.  Don't waste your money...wish I could get a refund.
B0081KTHEQ|5.0|I didn't know what to expect with this. It's the first movie I've watched with Radcliffe at the helm outside of HP and he was fabulous! His acting chops were great and the story was too. I was impressed.<br /><br />In a way it reminded me of the older, slowburn types of horror movies and I really enjoyed it. There are a lot of scares as well and the story and plot was executed well.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book is a great read.  The reader is held in suspense and is is unlikely to guess the outcome.<br />I found the first half of the book a lot better than the second half.  I was a bit disappointed by the ending.<br />Nonetheless I would recommend this book, you cannot fail but to form opinions about the two main characters and not only that but to change those self same opinions as the book progresses!
B005GFPZYK|2.0|I had expected more action and less retrospection. Insertions into the story from the wife were needless. Just a jumbled recollection of some ops. Sad that Chris is no longer with us, he was a true hero
B009DJB8I2|5.0|Just writing a review to confirm that this Soundtrack I ordered off Amazon still gives the TF2 and Dota 2 codes.<br /><br />Overall the album is alright, if you're really wanting it I'd recommend downloading it off the Portal 2 site for free. With that in mind, I'll talk about the packaging and the material itself.<br /><br />The case is just a simple multi-divided jewel case to hold the four discs. Nothing special, but not particularly bad either.<br /><br />The discs are all just fine, have good quality bitrates for the songs, and the CD covers look like Personality Cores.<br /><br />The soundtrack comes with a little mini comic to enjoy, and a couple of promo codes: An invite for DOTA 2 beta, and a product code for the &#34;What's in the Portal 2 Soundtrack Box?&#34; item (Also I got a mann co package which contains a random item from the Mann Co Store).<br /><br />So really all in all, I'd only get it if you're interested in the Ap-Sap. Otherwise you're probably better off just downloading it for free off the Portal 2 site.
0062197266|5.0|Now this was an excellent page-turning book (a little hard to follow at first) but well worthy of time reading it.
0547564651|5.0|This is an inspiring book that gives me hope for educational reform for the neediest children. There were multiple different sucessful ways to make a difference, so that I know if we decide as a society to stop the cycle of poverty, we can do it. It also gave me food for thought in my own parenting.
B004IPPINW|2.0|I enjoyed the first half of this book, unfortunately, I hated the second half.  I will not be reading any more of this author's works.
0765334798|1.0|As good as the Old Man's War saga was, \\"Redshirts\\" goes 180 degrees at full speed. I find it hard to put into words how disappointed I was to wait for this book to come out, and then read it and have it fall completely flat. I understand it's a satire, but the story is almost too easy without any real conflict or gripping plot twists. The character development is poorly executed with perhaps the most complicated character being a \\"yeti\\" that lives almost entirely behind the scenes. Scalzi seems to explain away his own weak story telling by using the satire label and how poorly Star Trek or other B grade sci-fi movies/shows are written. That is not good enough for me, and it shouldn't be good enough for anyone else that anticipated the release of this book either.
1451627297|5.0|A little history, I discovered Stephen King in the late 70's when everyone in the office was reading the Dead Zone and then Salem's Lot and other similar books.  I put him aside for a while after Pet Cemetery came out.  It was very upsetting to me.  But I read the Stand!  Then I reread The Stand every couple of years.  For a few years I got away from reading fiction then I picked up some of Stephen King's books and they were okay, good thrillers but not earth shaking.  I think he started finding his way back into my heart with Like a Buick 8 and Lisey's Story and now I think he is on top of his game again.<br /><br />King is King once again in the world of fiction.  I could not put it down until it was all over.  I love the way he ties up almost all the lose \\"strings\\" and brings the story full circle.  At the end I was close to tears, a rare thing for this old bird.<br /><br />I finished this several days ago and have been wondering how to review it.  I think it is more difficult to review a book you love and hits all the right notes vs one that falls way short.<br /><br />He creates a rich world both in the now and in the then.  His research and attention to detail made the stark contrast between his two worlds sharp and real.<br /><br />What I really appreciated is in how many books today the ending seems rushed, as if the writer either ran out of time before his publish date or lost his thesaurus and had to quit writing, Mr. King took his time and did a pretty good wrap up.  I would have liked a little more explanation about the yellow/green card man, but that is quibbling.<br /><br />His prose was also easy too read, without being juvenile or redundant.  Some other popular writers today could take a page out of this book and use language that is natural and flowing, not as if you're trying to win a bad literature contest.<br /><br />Great Job Stephen King, keep it up!
B002QGSYRC|5.0|I can only recommend this book. It goes well below the surface of the detailed military operations to show how the domestic politics determined the outcome in the battlefield. Regrettably. Not for the right wingers, though, as things are called by their name. Thanks to Mr Halberstam I have know a clearer vision of the events of the post-war era. Invaluable.
0982633939|4.0|Great Book. I've reread it several times. It took a very long time from ordering  to receiving it. I would like to read more David Doge books
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even after seeing the movie the book was worth reading. It allowed for a more intimate understanding for the characters that was not protrayed during the movie. The ending leaves you wanting more; wanting to know what is in store upon returning to District 12.
0765325950|3.0|I felt this book was an imitation of what I knew from the beginning of the series and what the author has always been capable of in his writing. Still I enjoyed the read and being part of the adventure but for the last time?
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is great story!  Mr. Makos gives us a well written insightful book that covers the story from both sides. I recommend this book to any one interested in WW II or aviation history. You won't be able to put it down
0345529057|5.0|What can I say that has not been said yet. It's a fantastic read. If you are going to read a book don't waste your time on dribble. Pick up something you can devote your time to and grab R.R. Martins Game of Thrones Series. I have literally waited what may approximate years for these books to come out and I have never been disappointed.

B007REV4YI|1.0|Skyfall is the first movie in my life I wanted to leave during the movie. I didn't leave simply because I never left a movie and I didn't know how. But I really wanted to. I've seen bad movies, I've laughed about plot holes, funny acting, absurd actions, but this one made me speechless. This movie is in so many ways against simple human logic so I was left wondering \\"Enh?\\".
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I really get a kick out of people complaining about an item that costs less than a good bottle of wine. If you don't like the remaster, take your cd's over to your local cd store (if there is one in your area) and sell them back, jeesh! I have owned this recording in EVERY format that it has been available, from high-quality vinyl, to DVD-Audio to whatever else is out there. I have listened to Rumours on systems that cost more than most cars and I will say this- this is the shizzle! It seems that every reincarnation of this album brings more to the dance, there are subtle details in the original album that were buried; they are now in the audible range. If you are complaining about the \\"loudness wars\\", then go and listen to another years state-of-the-art offering. I actually prefer this over my DVD-Audio copy, which, was the De Facto release according to my ears. I actually did read one guy who described Lindsey Buckingham's guitar as being \\"out of tune\\"? Out of tune with what? No one on earth can judge the guitar playing of Mr. Buckingham, so, all your haters, go listen to Taylor Swift. The live cd is awesome, on some nights Fleetwood Mac are merely superhuman, on others, unmatchable; by Zeppelin, the Stones, or anyone else. Great third disk, not only for completists, this disk shows how the sausage is made. Eat up!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|My family read this book a while back and loved it, so i thought i should read it again because i ran out of books, anyway it's a great book i definitely recommend this book.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I am able to download music for free,which saves a lot of money especially since those songs on the store all cost at least 1$.I have not had any problems with viruses and I have had this app for 6 months.(forgot to submit a review a long time ago).Anyways get the app it has free music downloads and has no viruses.
B001YOYVK6|4.0|A co-worker recommended I watch this because I was fishing for Mickey Rourke movies.  He told me of this one because of Robert De Niro.  I thought the story was great, I never suspected the outcome of the end.  It was good and very detailed.  If you like psychological thrillers, then watch this!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I ended up sending the blu ray back i believe because I do not have blue ray player, but i re-ordered and still love it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. But hated the ending, it didn't really have an ending and that was annoying. But very interesting
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Happened across the Wool Omnibus when it was a daily deal. This book is a must have. I just finished the sequel &#34;Shift Omnibus&#34; and cannot wait until the next installment. When I finished Shift I realized I hadn't left a review on Wool.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book if you are into scifi. The world of the silos goes deep!
B00846REIS|5.0|This is the first in a trilogy, and I'm loving it as much as I loved 50 shades.  It's well written, with lots of great love scenes, but also a good plot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its just fun to beat your own highscore repeatedly, with its simple game mechanics it is easy to playthe game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the 50 shades series! Is fin to read and transport yourself into someone else's life ever now and then!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I love this movie!!  It's hilarious.  Everything about this movie is funny; the parents, her brother, her, and her friends.  One of favorite movies EVER!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm really into these books.  I can't wait for the third one to be released! Is like 50 shades, but with enough differences to keep you interested.
B000URWYTS|4.0|I have mixed emotions.  I thought they were a perfect couple, but at the expense of two families.  I felt they were selfish and at the same time I admired their courage to pursue who they were!  I just can't get passed Mamah leaving her children! Her sister was more responsible when it came to the children, then their own mother.  I enjoyed the book and the authors approach to the story.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wish I found it sooner. Has four clock faces, works even when app is not running, multi ring tones, not a huge selection but something for everyone or add your own mp3. Easy to dim or bright, easy to use. U can also set your snooze time for how long you want it or turn it off. Has a white noise or add your own music for sleep setting.
031620157X|5.0|Wonderful story! I read it aloud to my 5th graders. They loved inferencing any chance they had. Awesome fantasy that starts out like realistic fiction.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the best game I have ever got I also think that it should be a dollar it's so good.
0345404475|5.0|I could not put it down. If you like Sci-Fi that makes you think about the nature of things, I would highly suggest this book.
B00A72989U|2.0|I was so disappointed by this cd. I expected much better from Alicia Keys. It still had her signature piano skills but I felt like she yelled too much, most of the songs were lack luster, and it was just corney with the exception of maybe 3 songs. Total dud for me. Good thing the download was free.
B007JMW46U|5.0|These are the best short stories I have ever read. I was never that interested in mystery novels, but the stories that Sherlock and Dr. Watson get into are thrilling. Rarely can I guess the solution to the mystery. They always keep me entertained.

B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver is obviously a hot topic since the 2012 election, so I wanted to read his take on how to build predictions. I work in statistics currently, so I was concerned it would be too much for the general public, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the stories about modeling. Silver definitely makes his point that Bayesian statistics can be more useful by forcing an initial assumption of probability, but he does that through numerous examples and an easy-to-read writing style. I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least moderately interested in statistics.
1452113432|5.0|I have been watching and re-watching the episodes of Rachel Khoo in her tiny kitchen in Paris (on the Cooking Channel),  enjoying her adventures vicariously (as I'm 64 and still have Paris on my &#34;wish list&#34;!).  In the meantime, I am enjoying traveling through the culinary escapades she shares with us on the pages of this beautifully written and as always for me, beautifully photographed cookbooks. In addition to her lifestyle, apartment, friends and culture of the French experience (I'm even learning a bit of the language!)  I'd recommend it to any Francophile who wants a &#34;taste&#34; of the French lifestyle through pics and recipes, til the real experience materializes!

If you want to actually get good furniture, you'll have to shell out 5 bucks. Not to mention that the game freezes at times, preventing you from getting on before the food spoils. All in all, a huge disappointment that sucks money.

B001RMYWG8|4.0|The movie \\"Serpico\\" is a very fine movie. It is important because it demonstrated that Al Pacino could carry a successful film as the star.  The supporting cast was excellent as well.  This movie is based on the true life story of a New York City police officer who joined the force as an idealistic young man only to discover that the force was full of corruption.  The more he fought against the corrupt policemen that he worked with every day, the more corruption he discovered and the more he found that as a single man trying to uncover the wrongdoing of the force and trying to make a difference in a positive way, the more frustrated he became.  Eventually, when he found all other avenues closed to him, he went to the media, the New York Times and a commission was finally formed to investigate the issues in the department.  For his trouble and trying to do the right thing, Serpico was shot and almost killed by fellow police officers.  At one point, he was told that a police officer who did not take money when it was offered could not be trusted.  Since Serpico could not be trusted, a conspiracy was formed to eliminate him.  His idealism quickly became frustration and cynicism.<br /><br />Serpico lives on in real life in Europe.  This movie is based on a book by Peter Haas and the account is pretty much true to life and not fictionalized. The women in his life and his family are pictured and add realism to the story and also are a sounding board to the frustration that he experienced during these years. Serpico grew as a person and during the course of the film, Al Pacino shows himself to be a brilliant actor. This early film helped set him as a versitile and talented actor.  This film was made after \\"The Godfather.\\"<br /><br />This movie was not the first or the last about the issue of corruption in police departments, LA Confidential comes to mind, but it is certainly one of the best.  Since this film is set in the sixties, it may seem a little dated now. It shouldhowever, stand the test of time and does show a great actor as he begins towards his greatness.
B0058YPG1G|2.0|Seasons 1 and 2 of Breaking Bad are, quite simply, some of the best, most exhilarating hours of TV we've ever seen. But season 3 grew increasingly lame, and season 4 is even duller--less believable plotlines, less interesting writing, less interesting characters, and a lot of filler. It's sad to see something so phenomenal deteriorate into something barely worth watching. If we knew then what we know now, we would have stopped watching at the end of season 2, saved the money spent on seasons 3 and 4...
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Anytime that you can consistently be nominated for an academy award, you are certainly doing something right. Washington has been nominated many times and he has won twice.  It goes without saying that he is one of the best actors working today.<br /><br />I am of the opinion that characters who seem to have it all, a successful career, charisma, looks, etc. who succomb to drugs and alcoholism, are particularly impressive to the public and the academy.  A long time ago, I watched the movie \\"The Days of Wine and Roses\\" and Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick received accolades for playing a couple destroyed by alcohol.<br /><br />The scene is set in \\"Flight\\" in the very first scene when Washington is shown, doing cocaine and alcohol with a stewardess, she is later killed in the movie, before he has to go on a fairly routine flight from Florida to Georgia.  At first, Washington is hailed as a hero for landing a plane that was flawed and it is mentioned that no other pilot could have done this.  However, when an investigation indicates that he had drugs and alcohol in his system while flying the aircraft, the end result is that he ends up in jail for at least five years.  He actually admitted to the fact that he had coke and alcohol in his system at the time.<br /><br />I thought that Tamara Tunie was good as a surviving stewardess, and I wish that Garcelle Beauvais had been in the film for more than one scene.  Don Cheadle is a great actor but I think that he was miscast as the attorney for Washington character.  The greatest supporting character was John Goodman who was the supplier for Washington and who actually saved his life.  Goodman was hilarious. I am not familiar with the man who played the co-pilot but he did well as the moral conscious of the movie who knew that Washington was drunk during the flight and the co-pilot is now going to ruined for life and blames Washington (not the fact that the plane was flawed).<br /><br />Many stories are written about people who'sdownfall is within themselves.  It is known as hubris and most of us are existing with it.  This portrayal is one of the better ones in recent years and is truly brought to light by a great actor,  Denzel Washington. However, I do believe that like a lot of great actors, Washington is playing himself more in movies than playing the character.  John Wayne and many others became so comfortable playing themselves that they are hardly to be considered acting anymore. Unfortunately, Denzel is falling into that category as well but if you like him as an actor, you will certainly enjoy this film. It is well written but not suspenseful because you can pretty much tell what the end result will be.
B0032UYFA6|3.0|This review is designed for people like my husband and me, who absolutely loved the early episodes of Breaking Bad. A warning to prospective purchasers--the quality of the show, so incredible in seasons 1 and 2, takes a serious dive in season 3. Frankly the show producers and writers seem to begin to run out of ideas, a lot of boring filler, less action, a lot less fun for the viewer. And season 4 is even worse!! It makes me sad to write this, but, having seen all four seasons available on DVD, if we had to do it over again, we would have stopped at the end of season 2, saved the money...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Especially since I've been waiting, what feels like a long time, to be reunited with Percabeth!<br /> The humor was there, the tears, everything!  I have been a fan of Percy Jackson for years and I'm not disappointed.<br />But in the fashion of Rick Riordan he had to end in a gut-wrenching, tear gushing climax that makes me jump up and down in anticipation until next fall. \\"Seven half-bloods shall answer the call.  To storm or fire, the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath/And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.  *chills*

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I thought Mockingjay had a sad ending; perhaps the author deemed it appropriate for the subject matter, but I wouldn't recommend the series as a \\"classic read\\".
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I'm the first to admit that going into this film I had low expectations. Cruise is a decent enough actor and well suited for the genre, but the plot seemed derivative and overly pedantic, just another flick I'd catch because...well...I'm a dude and the preview mentioned something about guns and explosives.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the plot played out steadily, not needing to be propped up by a few well placed action sequences. While, if you've seen any movie ever in your life, you'll be able to predict what's going to ultimately happen, \\"Reacher\\" maintains a consistent level of intrigue and charm through the whole length of the film. I appreciated that the action scenes actually added to the plot. I was expecting some random \\"Look how awesome I am at fighting\\" scenes tossed into the mix, and was happy to see that while those scenes are absolutely in there, they also help move the plot forward. Good thinking, action-movie-maker-people (pretty sure that's the correct technical job title, but don't quote me on that...)<br /><br />In sum, without telling you a thing about the film (because I hate summaries that are just spoilers in disguise), you can feel good about spending your money on this one. You'll enjoy it. Even if you hate Tom Cruise. That's right, I'm talking to you, Katie...

B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Love the new album.  Such soul, he's sings so effortlessly.  Love that the songs are longer than typical radio fare.  Feels higher production.  Only song I could do without is \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\"  .  Has a Bollywood feel that seems out of place in this classic soul album, feels like Timbaland reject beat.  Other than that I love it!

0316228532|3.0|In a way, The Casual Vacancy, by J.K. Rowling, is the story of a dysfunctional family. It follows the lives of 7 families who live in the community of Pagford, a small English city outside of the booming metropolis of Yarvil. Over 6 parts, we discover each member of these families and how they interact with each other, and other families within the community.<br /><br />All the characters presented have unfortunate parts of their personalities which make them unlikeable and only a few of them are shown to have any redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great story. It's a story of reflection and how you perceive yourself. I was disappointed by the end. There didn't seem to be much of a resolution. A lot was left unresolved that I think could have been handled in a couple of chapters tacked onto the end. I felt as if I only got a partial story and was missing the end of the book. But this could have been done purposefully by the author. Maybe she wanted to leave us with that feeling that things are unresolved.<br /><br />To read my whole review visit [...]
B0027WNRJ0|4.0|Look at any list of all-time greatest albums and you're likely to find two from the Def Leppard catalogue: 1983's Pyromania and 1987's near-perfect Hysteria. Now, prior to their Mutt Lange-produced breakthrough in '83, the band released two warm-up albums, and since Hysteria, have gone on to release about a half dozen discs of new material, a b-side disc, a covers album, and a couple greatest hits collections. Like a lot of bands, their star has dimmed quite a bit since their late-eighties heyday, even as they continue to fill modest arenas on their semiannual tours.<br /><br />Once in a while I come across their 1992 release Adrenalize in some bargain bin somewhere with a sticker that says $1.99 or something. The Hysteria follow-up was years in the making, an even longer gap than the epic one that spanned Pyromania and Hysteria. Adrenalize had its share of hits--not a bad accomplishment in the shadow of 90s grunge. \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" was a fun song that threw in everything but the kitchen sink. Lep fans ate it up. There were other singles that fared well after that: \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\", and \\"Stand Up (Kick Love Into Motion)\\". But obviously the album never earned that classic earmark that the band's previous two releases enjoy, but it almost could have.<br /><br />Adrenalize has a weak side one and a solid side two. Side two, to this day, is listenable start to front: \\"Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)\\" kicks it off, then the harder \\"Personal Property\\", followed by the single \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\", then the Sugary \\"I Wanna Touch U\\", and finally the re-recorded Hysteria-session b-side \\"Tear It Down\\". Good stuff one through five.<br /><br />Side one doesn't fare quite so well. \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" was a good first single at the time and kicks off the album with an in-your-face barrage of wall-of-sound nonsense, but as years go on this song, a staple at concerts, is when I make my bathroom run. That being said, I loved it at the time and still accept it as pop fun. \\"Heaven Is\\" is just okay, and \\"Make Love Like a Man\\", the second single, is forgettable at the very least and even sillier than the first single. \\"Tonight\\" is a flat ballad that never leaves the starting gate, and \\"White Lightning\\" is an attempt at an epic song the likes of \\"Gods of War\\", but again, the song evaporates and never quite imprints on the brain the way a good song should.<br /><br />What's strange is that the singles, released on CD, were backed with really cool b-side tracks. The worst of the bunch was \\"Only After Dark\\", the cover tune paired with \\"Let's Get Rocked\\". But it got good from there. Later singles came packaged with \\"Two Steps Behind\\", which later became a nice little hit for the band when it appeared on a movie soundtrack a couple years later, the sandpaper-harsh \\"She's Too Tough\\", the ballad \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\", and the Sweet cover \\"Action\\". I filled up a blank tape with these tracks and pretty much had Adrenalize side three, and it was the best side of them all.<br /><br />Which got me thinking: did the band put the wrong tracks on the album? How different--and better--would the lineup have been if this had been the track listing (replacement songs in italics):<br />SIDE ONE:<br />1)  Let's Get Rocked<br />2)  She's Too Tough<br />3)  Two Steps Behind<br />4)  Action<br />5)  Miss You in a Heartbeat<br /><br />SIDE TWO:<br />6)  Stand Up (Kick Love into Motion)<br />7)  Personal Property<br />8)  Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad<br />9)  I Wanna Touch You<br />10)  Tear It Down<br /><br />Now, the slick pop assault of \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" is followed with a stripped down screamer, with Joe Elliot's vocals razor blade raw as ever. Then \\"Two Steps Behind\\" as the album's signature ballad. And since we know it's a hit, the song gives the album a lift of credibility. \\"Action\\" is a cover, but that's okay. Who says covers have to be b-sides? The song is not a familiar one to a lot of non-Sweet fans, and it's a catchy substitute for \\"Make Love Like a Man\\". This could have been the second single. \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" end side one with another ballad. Now those other four songs become b-side extras, where they belong. And we're getting closer to a classic album.<br /><br />The fact that Adrenalize only offers ten tracks always felt a bit short, especially when fans waited five long years after the epic 12 tracks of Hysteria. Consider the fact that \\"Tear It Down\\" isn't really even a new track, and the album gets even skinnier. \\"Tear It Down\\", by the way, is a great song, and although it helps Adrenalize quite a bit, the truth is it belonged on Hysteria in place of \\"Excitable\\". So maybe then it needed an 11th track to give it some heft: maybe \\"Fractured Love\\", which later appeared on their b-side album from 1994 but dates back to the Hysteria recording sessions. Okay, so track 11 is \\"Fractured Love\\", ending the album on the kind of epically dark note that could have given the album the punch to the gut it probably needed.<br /><br />Finally, it was released late. Granted, Steve Clark died in '91, delaying the recording sessions no doubt. But still, five years was a long time. The album did well given that the grunge front had rolled in about a year before, but probably would have done even better, and perhaps been viewed more favorably down the road, with 1990, or even 1991, as a contextual frame.<br /><br />Finally (part two): Adrenalize was a weak title (if I remember correctly it came from a naming contest). It's a nonsense verb and sounds hokey, and does nothing to help the boring lightning strikes on the cover art.<br /><br />So here's the fix: shuffle those b-sides into the lineup, pull out tracks 2-5, get the album on shelves one year earlier, call it Fractured, and the Leps might have nailed the trifecta.

B00BCZU8WM|1.0|I was really looking forward to finally getting more music from JT and almost bought this new CD without listening to the samples first.  I'm so glad I didn't do that!  What the heck is this crap?!?  Please give me the old JT back.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A great clean book with a delightful twist to an old favorite. You and your teens have just gotta read it.
B0011UBDTK|3.0|I've only watched 3 discs so far and two of them have skipped.  This happens in two different DVD players, so it's not the player, it's the disc. I'm hoping it's just a fluke and the rest of the discs work fine.<br /><br />*UPDATED 3/30* Every single disc skips.  Some episodes don't even play.  I'm extremely disappointed.  Spending over $100, I'd expect them to work.
1250007208|5.0|Oh my god, this book is my new obsession. It's simply amazing.Each character is fantastic. The book is like a retelling of Cinderella but at the same time, it's very different from the original story of Cinderella that everyone is used to. I'm usually someone that hates robots, yet I love this book. Not only that, but this book is the only book that makes me support the androids and cyborgs.<br /><br />The characters:<br /><br />Prince Kai is charming and handsome. He completely won me over.<br /><br />Cinder is very relate-able. She is the girl who is unappreciated and mistreated by the family. She is an outcast, but has potential to be a a heroine. She is amazing and her troubles really make the readers feel sympathetic towards her. I was cheering for her until the very end.<br /><br />Peony made me cry at certain parts of the book. I can't even imagine what she had gone through.<br /><br />Pearl and her mother are despicable. The author did an amazing job making the readers hate them.<br /><br />Queen Levana is like the Devil. The scene with the mirror during dinner was simply disturbing. I was literally holding my breath when I read that scene.
B009YX02T8|5.0|One of my favorite soundtracks.  I gave it 5 stars because it just sounds great.  The movie is good too.  Have a listen!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I used to have one of these knives that I got from the mall knife shop.  Lost that one and found this one on line.  It's a Ka-Bar so it's worth the money, plus the knife itself is great.  Super sharp.  holds it's edge very well.  The one I had before rusts quick if you don't keep it oiled.  As long as you keep it clean you'll be fine.  Plastic handle can be taken off and either replaced with an aftermarket handle set or paracord if you know what you're doing.  I made a set of handles out of maple.  It's a good knife I used for skinning and prying if needed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|CORKIGP<br />I couldn't put this book down, the author is able to put you in the mind of the main character and feel as if you are there.  I just don't recommend reading it on a weeknight.

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This is really a classic story about leaving home and the journey to get back home again. The details are the fun and adventure. The Hobbit was the original story by Tolkien for his grandchildren. It retains some the the bedtime story elements in this movie. It is much less serious as LoTR, but even more serious in the strong emotional tie to your home. The dragon, sadly, is the last one in Middle Earth, and the tale about reclaiming the dwarves home is a mountain of gold. You only get a teaser of the dragon in this movie, but you really feel like you signed the papers to join this dwarf company too. Tolkien could have made a long running TV series based on his in depth creations. This movie is better than LoTR because it rests on the veterans that made LoTR a masterpiece. This is truly a timeless classic of Hollywood.

B008BIN9EW|4.0|Maybe there will be an update, but when I downloaded this there were only a few dozen levels in the campaign, many of those repeats.  Basically, the game consists of three tutorial campaigns, one for each playable race: Humans, Robots, and Bugs.  Sometimes the the stories would cross over and you would play an earlier map from the other team.  But once you learn every unit for a race, their section is done.<br /><br />I just wish there were a real campaign for each race.  The quickplay mode is OK, but not the same as a story.
B000W1ME4W|5.0|Being a big fan I always am searching for JJ Cale music I do not have. Although this is an older album it still is a good collection of his music.<br /><br />Since the sad departure of JJ Cale I have been listening to this CD and I have to say it is a wonderful collection of classic JJ Cale. We will miss his talent in this world. Hope his next journey will be as good as the last. RIP
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I've downloaded the free version of this game before, but I decided I'd give it another go.  The puzzles themselves take a good deal of concentration to get through, so its not exactly the most relaxing game, but you can take all the time you need.<br /><br />I have two issues with the controls: The zoom is hard to control, and will often overshoot or undershoot the zoom you are trying for.  Along with that, the selection is sometimes difficult if the screen is zoomed too far out (playing on a 4.8in screen).  It is much easier on a tablet screen.  The bad selection causes some frustration with the game, but nothing major.

B008B92U32|2.0|This is worth a free download for a laugh, but it's pretty buggy and the results are just so-so.  The app just gives you two adjustable ovales to put over a pair of faces in a photo.  Then the app switched the ovals.  Thats fine, but manipulating the ovals is pretty buggy, and you have to play with it much longer than you should have too.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was most entertaining I could relate to the dogs thoughts and picture my own when he looks at me
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Great album! I had to take my record player out for this one. Nothing beats the unique sound of vinyl. With the style of the album, it suits (and ties) it quite well. 10/10 on this JT album. The tracks are on two separate vinyls (total of 4 sides).<br />Note: Ordered directly through Amazon.com and it does come with the Album Digital Download Code on a sheet with his image at the bottom and Justin Timberlake did confirm the rumors; he is coming out with a part two!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I just love her voice. The music, tone, the whole package. It's a thoroughly enjoyable album to listen to. It's hard to review items that are more opinion based due to personal preference, or how something strikes you on a deeper level, than anything else.<br /><br />Lana Del Ray is definitely a talented artist. I would buy more of her work.
B00B4VXQC8|3.0|Well here we are at the start of a new decade with new Bon Jovi music! This album as Jon Bon Jovi has said in countless interviews is to be the soundtrack of president Obama`s first term. Personally I think Jon went a little over board with the political songs normally I think it`s pretty cool when an artist can write and compose a song that reflects what`s going on nowadays in America. But I think Jon over killed the album with political material.<br />The album sounds great and was produced very well by John Shanks who has produced the bands last 3 albums. Another thing that I was kinda bummed out about was that Richie Sambora really didn`t get a chance to show his guitar talants on this record. Now I`m not expecting him to do guitar work on here that`s the same as what was on keep the faith or these days because you can`t repeat the same thing over and over again. But it seem like on some songs his guitar<br />solo was cut off abruptly. Now I`ve listened to this album twice now and personally it doesn`t hit me as hard as some of their previous albums but there are some really great tracks on here! Such as I`m With You, Pictures Of You, That`s What The Water Made Me, Thick As Theives, Beautiful World, and Room At The End Of The World. Well I hope this interview was helpful to anyone that happened to read my review have a good one and keep the faith!
B0015XHP4K|5.0|I had the Rambo films on dvd and decide since I got a blu ray player to update them and get the blu rays of the movie.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I am a HUGE fan of Denzel Washington. With that said, this movie is NOT what I expected AT ALL! I watched the commercials, trailers, talked to friends about the movie, and ALL signs pointed to a man being surprisingly sued for wrongdoing after saving a flight from catastrophe. The trailers were misleading... Maybe he WAS the ONLY pilot that could've pulled off a landing like that w/ a manfunctioning plane but, he WAS bad! He did terrible things! (which were ALL shown throughout the movie!) YES, in the last few minutes of the movie, he realized that he was a terrible person! But, after watching all of the deprivation and degradation that he engaged in thought the ENTIRE movie and even used the same things he was in trouble for, being used to help him out in the end.... AWEFUL & DISGUSTING! Maybe that is the way the movies have gone, but I found the buildup very misleading and I was totally disappointed with this film.
B00846REIS|5.0|A raw, explicit look into the lives of two people destined for each other, somehow. A well written easy read that moves you along quickly. Can't wait to read the next one.

B0094K1MH2|5.0|What a fabulous movie!! Such innovation - now I want to know how this was made. Don't let this movie pass by. Simply wonderful.
B005I0DUMC|5.0|The product arrived on time as expected. I enjoyed the movie, will watch it again. Great cast of characters. Sly proves he really can act, if you have questioned that, watch this movie. I would even buy as a gift for someone.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|I had played and beat the previous (easier) two perplexus models so I wanted a challenge so I bought the epic version.<br />So far I have found this version impossible.<br />I can barely make through the first 15 gates.<br />It is extremely difficult and frustrating so now it is gathering dust in my closet.<br /><br />Also, a nit-picky aspect is that there are specs of dirt inside of the perplexus.<br />It arrived to me in the box with the dirt inside of it.<br />I find it kind of annoying that dirt was trapped inside of it, but not much I can do about that now other than break it open which might of happened anyway if I continued to play this puzzle.

B00AE2IJIE|5.0|My kids loved the movie, very entertaining. Great animation, looked great in our HD TV. I do recommend it. Nothing else to say.
B007REV4YI|3.0|Not too impressed. I had no sense of urgency or tension regarding the plot in this one - as it was total weaksauce. Too bad, as I waited with bated breath for the studio to pull its head out of yon dark hole and release skyfall. Not going to help their cause if they keep releasing bond movies like this. When the bad guy wants to see the world burn for his/her personal gain, I'll come back to the party. Until then I'm off to watch titanic - it's almost the same movie.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|I saw the original version of this when it came out and remembered it vividly, but came away feeling ambivalent.  The war sequence on entering Cambodia was amazingly evocative and absurdist, close to Michael Herr's brilliant impressionistic take on the Vietnam War.  Then, upon arrival in Kurtz's camp, I felt it became an alternate reality and fell apart.  Brando overplayed the part, but the content, with literary quotations and intellectual allusions to such things as the Golden Bough or TS Eliot was an attempt to make Kurtz into some kind of primal chief or violent Buddha.  It didn't work.<br /><br />Now, almost 35 years later, I had to see it again, in the longer Redux version.  I must say, it held up extremely well, and the bluray print is fabulous.  Please note:  the interpretation that follows assumes the reader has watched the film.  It doesn't avoid spoilers.<br /><br />On the one hand, the story is good, far better in my opinion than the Conrad novella.  You have a soldier who is a wounded man, who is seeking death or some kind of redemption.  He returns to fight in Vietnam, hungering for the bush because there is nothing to his life but killing, and has a kind of nervous breakdown while waiting for his orders.  Then, he learns about someone similar to himself, Kurtz, a once-great soldier that has gone AWOL and created an independent killing force somewhere in Cambodia.  He is ordered to find and assassinate him.<br /><br />The solider's journey to Kurtz represents a kind of rebirth, finding his humanity as he absorbs the story of what happened to this man reputed to be a sincere humanitarian and true leader.  It is on the journey that the film works best, with absolutely brilliant performances by first-rate actors.  There is Duvall's napalm lover, a super macho surfing enthusiast who loves to fight and never questions his road to victory.  But the crew of the transport boat is even better, with a young Larry Fishburne, for one, but also Frederick Forrest as hapless grunts.  Except for the imported bits of Americana, they leave civilization for an alien landscape, climaxing in Kurtz's killing zone in Cambodia.  I found it completely believable and disorienting, truly original.<br /><br />However, the end sequence and Kurtz's mental state still didn't quite work for me.  Brando kind of hams it up, but he is somehow unconvincing.  I wasn't moved by Sheen's opportunity to take his place as alpha male after the assassination.  Still, Sheen's evolution as he regains his humanity is enough not to ruin the film.  I am very glad that I own this version and will watch it many times.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am not sure the Redux adds anything except titillating bits for film enthusiasts.  It is too long to watch at a single sitting.  The new sequences also slow the action, particularly the bizarre interlude on the rogue French colonial estate, where a family is suicidally devoted to keeping its patch of land and business with a private army.  Finding the Playboy girls is funny and pathetic, but adds little to the story and is unrealistic, like they are losing it in the bush and don't mind their publicist pimping them for gas supplies.  Finally, the new music score was jarring for me, feeling unnaturally grafted onto a work that was finely tuned in the original.<br /><br />This is one of those auteur films from the last truly experimental era of Hollywood.  It is as much a political statement as it is a war story.  Soon after this, Hollywood became driven by marketing committees, producing formula films on a conveyor belt, designed to hit all the notes that audiences wanted yet lacking soul, lacking the voice of a solitary literary mind.  Today's films can be very good, but they lack the quirkiness of this kind of experiment.<br /><br />Recommended, in spite of its flaws.  It is a great and unique viewing experience and the bluray print is worth the price.hapless grunts.

B0002E5O9G|5.0|Saw this play 3 times and had to have the CD.  Your price was reasonable.  CD is in perfect shape, sounds beautiful and will always make me feel as though I am at the play a 4th, 5th, 6th time!
B00009MGGI|5.0|When I learned that they were making a new version of this film, I remembered how much we enjoyed it on PBS.  We got it in Britain for about $15.  It was a fabulous deal.  Over our free time during 2 weeks, we enjoyed this as much as the first time we saw it.  There are 12 hours of story, starting with this rise to power, his take-on of the king while in power, and his shenanigans as he loses his grip.<br /><br />It is the story of a genuinely evil man, who is intelligent, ruthless, and full of guile.  From a bag boy-type job, he works his way to the top, utterly without scruple in ways that are hard to imagine.  Once he is wielding power, he can inflict the humilation on others that he endured and he doesn't shrink from any of it.  And his policies, simply abhorent.  The PM is completely convincing.  There is plenty of sex, unprincipled tactics, even murder.  Yet there is also a fascinating overview of the British political system.<br /><br />I don't see how the American version can be transferred into the American system.  There is no king, the President can't be voted out by his own party, etc.  It will be a transmogrification, however much I respect the American actors.<br /><br />You can't improve on perfection.  Warmly recommended.

B00650SSDU|5.0|This is a great movie in my opinion. How can you go wrong with Mila Kunis, she is just so beautiful and funny. Great chick flick to watch when you need a feel good.

B00005JPS6|5.0|I do not have children and I absolutely LOVE this movie! It has an all-star cast, including Oprah Winfrey, Larry King, Chris Rock, etc.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An amazing story. The brotherhood, absolute courage, and valor of the men in this recount are absolutely amazing. It has been a long while since a book has run my full palette of emotions. One will find themselves gripped by action, sorrowed by loss, and inspired to be an American. If after reading about this harrowing battle and the courage of our armed forces if one does not thank every service person and veteran you meet consider yourself a disgrace to America. We should all rest easy knowing these men make it possible, and no amount of anything can repay them or their families for their sacrifice!
1426308469|3.0|This book was given to my three year old son as a gift.  He is obsessed with learning about dinosaurs and the content and illustrations in this book are fantastic!  We read it daily and he has most of the dinosaurs memorized in just the few short weeks we have owned it.  He can now spout off all sorts of dinosaur facts to anyone willing to listen - it is an awesome addition to our home library.<br /><br />However...  after having the book for only 4 weeks the binding is starting to come apart...  My son has been an avid reader (or rather, a lover of books as he doesn't read yet... but he frequently looks at books on his own) since he was very little and was taught how to handle books from a very young age.  What I mean to say is that it isn't coming apart because a three year old has ravaged it... It has had the same amount of wear and tear as if an adult were reading it.  Unfortunately I have had to tape a number of pages at the binding in hopes that they won't fall out.  This is a favorite book at our house and I can only hope it holds up.  I am shocked at such poor construction...  I am not sure I would buy a new copy if the pages start falling out of this one only to have it (probably) happen again.
1400069807|3.0|This book contains some interesting stories about how large food companies minutely cater their products to suit our tastes by dialing up salt, sugar, and fat, often at the expense of nutrition.  The vilification of these companies, however, is overdone and the blame misplaced.  We the consumers vote with our wallet every time we go to the store.  If we stop buying sugary, fatty, salty crap, companies will start losing money on these products and stop selling them.  If we start buying more organic produce, sustainable seafood, and humane meat, more shelf space will be allocated to these products at the expense of empty, tasty calories.  For those people claiming we are misled by advertising, I have a hard time believing people really think Kool-aid and Oreos are healthy.  We all know it's crap, but it's tasty crap we can't resist.  Who is at fault here?  I would say at least 50% of the blame is on us for supporting big food by buying their products.<br /><br />Companies exist to make money for their shareholders.  This profit motive is what drives innovation and progress, and doing everything possible to increase profits is exactly what companies should and are expected to do.  The author implies that in addition to profits, companies should incorporate broader considerations of public health and welfare.  If you agree, stop buying from companies whose products/policies you disagree with.  That would pressure corporate policy far more effectively than moral outrage or regulations.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This book was better than I expected it to be. I read it all at once because I couldn't put it down. Lost some sleep that night.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This is a wonderful album.  Yes, I am a huge Bowie fan, and this album does not disappoint...with subtle (and not so subtle like the drums at the end of You Feel So Lonely You Could Die) musical references to much of his catalog.  And yes, the album is very strong lyrically.  But the reason I find myself re-listening to this over and over is the astonishing quality and range of his voice.  Check out his singing the verses of \\"I'd Rather Be High\\", then remember the guy is in his 60s.  Incredible.<br /><br />Strongest tracks on the album are the snarling \\"Dirty Boys\\" and the building-in-intensity \\"Love is Lost\\".<br /><br />One should also praise the excellent production throughout the album from Tony Visconti.<br /><br />An additional note...the extra 3 tracks on the Deluxe version are worth it...I really love \\"So She\\" which is as strong as anything on the album.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I kind of liked this book. However if it weren't for all the hype about it, I would have never read it. In all honesty, it was kind of stupid.
3836503050|1.0|I ordered this item hoping to surprise my girlfriend on her Birthday with it on her coffee table as she loves pinup stuff. I just looked and it hasn't even shipped! No correspondence from the seller. Highly unproffessional!!! Do not buy from this seller unless you like Waiting for them to ship whenever they feel like it, if they ever do at all! I ordered some stuff direct from china after I placed this order, and I already got them, wow pretty lame.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Overall, I would say Silver Linings is a good book.  Quick is a great writer.  I felt events flowed, visual imagery was colorful and detailed, and the characters were realistic.  The main character had funny lines that helped punctuate the sadness with some relief. He was really the only likeable character for me.  Some other characters weren't developed enough to know too well.  They all had a hand in isolating the character during his darkest hour but this was resolved with quick, aloof apologies and expensive stadium tickets.  This harsh treatment just melted away without much development or closure by the author.  The main character picked up the pieces by himself, which as a mentally ill person would only happen in a book/Hollywood picture.  I had just watched The Master and then started/ended this book(Kindle)a few days later.  I add that to share that between the two I ended my weekend with awful imagery of a lot of horrible people/characters. Pat Peoples' father is depressing and horrible - he starts and ends there.  It might be funny in a movie with Robert DeNiro playing the part but in book form its pretty sad.  Also, it plateaued in the middle of the book with too many football scenes and details of tailgating and cheering, etc.  It pictured awful fans that took it to the extreme, which made me wonder if the author was mocking football fans or loved football.  I, personally, ended up hating football.  One last point, its not very climatic for all the secrets it holds.  It peaked without much fanfare when part of the truth is finally revealed in silly letter form.  All that for nothing, I thought.  I would recommend this book if people want a quick read.  And, then watch the movie.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great book.  Not really a zombie book - hard to explain why I say that.  Ask me if you're interested...
B00555X8OA|5.0|It is an excellent book packing into a common, easy to read, and engaging language the concepts a graduate class in modern economics. The discussion of the decision processes within a two system frame is excellent and easy to absorb. I hope that this is one of the many books to follow in the developing field of more &#34;representative,&#34; or &#34;realistic&#34; school that  that will finally nail the coffin in the idioticy of the simplistic Chicago economic school.
B000000OA6|4.0|Having just recently learned that QUEEN was much more than a pompous arena rock band (WE WILL ROCK YOU, ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUST, etc.), I have bought several of QUEENS albums. INNUENDO just might be the best of the bunch (with an argument being made that MADE IN HEAVEN could fill that role.) The album is a roller coaster of emotions being powered by the contrasting differences in styles brought by and within each band member. But having grown up on classic rock, my tastes have changed dramatically from the days when FOREIGNER and JOURNEY were among my favorite bands into a far more introspective and intellectual man. With that being said, I simply adore the works such as THESE ARE THE DAYS OF OUR LIVES (written by a drummer no less) and other songs of such poignancy as to be almost tearful when considering the tragedy that was overwhelming Freddie Mercury at the time.<br /><br />Some of the songs are overwrought QUEEN songs, but then it wouldn't be a QUEEN album without such. From the band that created stadium rock (see the forementioned songs), I am simply amazed at the wonderful works that never became hits. This album exemplifies everything that was great about QUEEN.<br /><br />This is... a DAMN GOOD ALBUM! Its just a shame that such great music lost in popularity to the contrived hair metal, grunge, ska, rap and all of the other s*** that sold millions of records while Freddie was suffering... and since.<br /><br />I am ashamed that I did not buy this album when it was first released. But at least I have it now... This is... A DAMN GOOD ALBUM!!!!

1439163154|1.0|I'm inlove with James Franco as an actor, when I found out he had written a book I was so excited to read his words. my heart raced as I tear the tape off the package, there it was \\"palo alto\\" as I lift the 213 page contents I quickly adjust my recliner and curled up like a kid as I read one story to the next the anticipation quickly turned into heartbreak it read like stories I wrote in kindergarten,<br />feeling of embarrassment for this so called author showered over me to the point where I was almost moved to tears there I sat thinking,i could spent my ten bucks on some weed and<br />imagine erotic thoughts of him instead it would of been more pleasurable than this \\"hot mess\\" and I use the term with much emphasis I pondered upon the thought how did this guy got into Yale for hours and then it hit me he's famous, if a bum like me wrote this in its original format it would never make it off the publishers desk. James my love do me a favor never entertain the thought of writing again some people has the gifts for words and others well my mother often said if you had nothing nice to say I think you know the rest.

034544678X|5.0|Blown away by this book. A former dog owner, and intermittent friend of other canines, I am always seeking to improve my body language when it comes to dogs, not so much to train them, but in order to, untuck their tails, relax their body posture and play with me!<br /><br />I am anticipating adopting another dog (My first in over 10 years since childhood) in the near future and want to be the best canine companion I can possibly be. One must train his/herself before one can expect others to follow their example and/or command; this goes for people as well as for dogs. I am highly impressed with this book and I know that I will be a much more fluent individual, with both humans and canines...too bad humans are just so hard to figure out....dogs are much easier! Highly recommended...

B009PK9SB8|5.0|I let this sit around my house for a couple weeks before I hooked it up.  What a mistake.  This thing is so handy!  Aside from the obvious fact that you now have a viewfinder, navigating all your settings and options is much easier, second only to the iPhone app.  But I'm not taking my iPhone out on the flats!  It comes with a soft-backed quasi waterproof back (among the standard backs) that lets you use it without worrying about water (said flats).  You wouldn't use it snorkeling or diving though, as it's only good down to 10'/3m and \\"Touch functions do not work underwater.\\" Not sure exactly what that is saying. Think of it as a case you could use on a rainy day. And switching between this and the [[ASIN:B009PK9SBS GoPro Battary BacPac for HERO Cameras]] is a breeze as it will eat up your battery!<br /><br />Note: This LCD BacPac is for the GoPro 3 line of cameras.  Black colored items = GoPro 3 \\"generation\\" of cameras. White = GoPro 1 & 2 generation.

1594487154|5.0|I am a 23 year old graduate student studying online learning. Daniel Pink's books \\"Drive\\" and \\"To Sell is Human\\" have had a dramatic impact on how I understand the work I currently do and the career I hope to develop. I strongly recommend picking up both... especially if you are someone who is just entering the job market.<br /><br />As you probably already know, Pink believes that, more and more, people will do work that requires them to perform multiple different tasks. He further believes that this concept of job role \\"elasticity\\" means that less and less people will be doing routine, repetitive tasks. So then what will we be doing?<br /><br />Selling! A lot of what we will be doing is moving others to part with resources, whether tangible (ex: money) or intangible (ex: time). Pink believes that we already do this a lot. For example, he believes that when we send email or have meetings we are performing the role of a seller.<br /><br />Now that both sellers and buyers have the same access to information (ex: internet) sellers must take new means to get buyers to part with resources. In the past, sellers could more easily manipulate buyers into parting with their resources. Besides manipulation, one of the main ways sellers in the past were able to get buyer's resources was by solving buyer problems. For example, a buyer problem might be that their carpet was dirty. A seller's solution might be to sell that person a vacuum cleaner. But now that both parties have equal access to information, the seller's job becomes more that of a problem finder. For example, the seller would have a better chance of finding customers if he was, not solving an existing problem that the buyer knew about, but informing potential buyers that their real carpet dirt problems were related to something that they were not aware of; such as a vent filtration issue for example.<br /><br />Much of the rest of the book is formed by Pink's recommendations on how you, the seller, can become better adept at selling. These final sections are well written and provide the reader with a clear understanding on how they can improve.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I remember this movie when I was a kid and loved it because you could immerse yourself into the story and feel a part of the movie.

B00AYR2FQ6|4.0|Up until now Matthew Houck the guiding light behind the Phosphorescent moniker has specialised in warm slices of road weary Americana not least 2010's rollicking \\"Here's to taking it easy\\" and of course his earlier tribute to a great country outlaw \\"To Willie\\". There has always been in Houck however an inner Neil Young screaming to experiment and push the envelope. On \\"Taking it easy\\" hidden amongst the country rumble was \\"Los Angeles\\" a huge rolling beast of a song which really was a meeting of rustic Alabama and experimental Brooklyn combining Houck's own geographical journey from rural to urban. His new album \\"Muchacho\\" plays a different card derived from Houck's decamp to Mexico following relentess touring and exhaustion. The restless troubadour has therefore incorporated for the first time electronica in a big way into his songs and packed them full of undulating synthesiser arpeggios not least the opening shot of \\"Sun Arise - an invocation, an introduction\\" a sort of Fleet Foxes hymnal meets Aphex Twin oceanic beats and bass lines. The album is bookended by its counterpart \\"Sun's Arising \\"A Koan, an exit\\" essentially the same track but slightly more acoustic. If you love spiritual harmony tunes then this will push all your buttons but frankly for this reviewer one bite of this particular cherry was already pushing it and the second portion created musical indigestion. Much better is the splendid signature track from the album \\"Song for Zula\\". Here the combination of Houck's reedy voice and slabs of synth combine in a great song underpinned by soaring pedal steel. Everything is in its right place on this track and it should be the immediate target for a download. More traditional Houck territory is explored on \\"Terror in the Canyon\\" a lovely alt country anthem infused with bar room heartbreak while \\"Down to go\\" multiplies this by a factor of two. It is a good old country heartbreaker infused with a mournful mariachi trumpet solo winding through its passages infusing it with a border Rio Grande atmosphere. When Houck sings \\"Oh, you'll spin your heartache into gold,....but it rips my heart out don't you know\\" you feel the wounded hurt.<br /><br />\\"Muchacho's Tune\\" is a road weary pastoral tune that proves that Stephen Fry's maxim that \\"It would be impossible to imagine going through life without swearing, and without enjoying swearing,\\". More powerful is the haunting \\"A New Anhedonia\\" which is a distant cousin of \\"Los Angeles\\" and contains Houck's best vocal, likewise the seven minute plus \\"The Quotidian Beasts\\" is tortured redemptive country and the hardest rocking track on the album. The problem is that amongst all this finery are tracks which really don't add much in the memorable tunes stakes not least the very repetitive \\"Ride on/Right on\\". As such on \\"Muchacho\\" Houck is to be applauded for his ambition but not always his execution. There is enough on here to place this album into the box marked \\"success\\" and it makes the next stage of Houck's musical evolution one well worth following.using it with a border Rio Grande atmosphere.

B00AM0C6YG|4.0|Laura Mvula is a new and prodigious talent from Birmingham who would be well advised to demand a recount from the BBC's poll the Sound of 2013. Here she finished fourth behind the rather average band Haim. On the evidence of this debut album \\"Sing to the Moon\\" she was robbed. Mvula arrives in the most crowded of musical fields and the key to success here is the ability to present extra dimensions in terms of both singing and song writing, She is probably fed up already with comparisons to Nina Simone but they do echo throughout this record which is one of the reasons that why parts of it are so special. Some of the music on here has already been previewed in her earlier EP \\"She\\" released in November last year yet they fit wonderfully into the context of this debut when we witness Laura Mvula's talent in the round. Opener \\"Like the morning dew\\" is a case in point. It opens with a wall of voices alia the Beach Boys and then moves into a tender ballad where Mvula's phrasing and vocals are exemplary. It is on \\"Green Garden\\" where the Simone comparison is perhaps most obvious not least with the \\"Sinnerman\\" style hand claps in the background and the almost spoken vocal. It is nonetheless a great R & B song which deserves its rightful status as a sparkling single. Other songs like the aching ballad \\"Can't live with the world\\" and the joyous almost Pet Sounds sounding \\"Is there anybody out there\\" show the foundations for an incredible talent. It is a contest however between \\"Father Father\\" and \\"She\\" which vie for the albums best track. The former is a sublime jazzy piano ballad which will replay repeated listens. \\"She\\" alternatively has the edge with it wonderful melody, superb backing and a timeless quality. Mvula's spoken vocal draws you into the song describing how \\"She walked towards you with her head down low/ She wondered if there was a way out of the blue/Who's gonna take her home this time? She knew that this time wouldn't be the last time\\". This moves into a huge choral backdrop which is both haunting and immaculate. Indeed you must promise to seek out the sterling video that accompanies the song.<br /><br />There are a couple of missteps here with \\"Flying without you\\" being rather to clever for its own good and far too close for comfort to Amy Winehouse circa her debut \\"frank\\", whilst \\"I know what the weather will be\\" is rather lightweight and frankly lacks a memorable tune. The title track makes up for these deficiencies. It is slow and glacial ballad which builds gradually into a huge anthem accompanied by almost military style drums. Even better is the last track \\"Diamonds\\" where Mvula's voice receives its best showcase on a truly beautiful song. There are some nice extras bolted onto the deluxe edition not least demo's of \\"She\\" and \\"Green Garden\\" plus solid live versions of \\"Father Father\\" and \\"Diamonds\\" all are which are fascinating but not completely vital in the context of very polished main body of work.<br /><br />\\"Sing to Moon\\" presents a singer laden with promise and possibilities of much great things to come. As it stands this debut is a big calling card for Laura Mvula and if there is any justice it will grab the hearts and minds of the record buying public. Her ambition on this work is to be applauded containing as it does music ranging from classic orchestral chamber music to retro soul. The fact that it doesn't all work is a consequence of this, yet when it all the parts come together Mvula presents us with a uplifting soul vision which is destined for great things.horal backdrop which is both haunting and immaculate.

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I normally do not review apps, how ever I am impressed with this one. I am crazy sick of match three games because they are ALL the same usually, however this one is different. It has quality sound and move flawlessly on my Galaxy S3. It also has an end to levels and an objective in each one. Every level has a certain trinket that is broken into puzzle like peices and is mixed in with the board. The object is to get those peices to the bottom by macthing 3 of different colored tiles. You just simply work them down to the bottom. The game also offers power up type things to help you. If you sit on the power up and do not use it, it will eventually turn into a better one with more points. Very cool game. Good job on rebooting a tired classic for me.

The 3D quality is great, much better than most movies that have been converted to 3D for home viewing. It might seem a little expensive, but I highly recommend going for the 3D set, since you will also receive Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copies to go along with it.

B008JFUN8C|5.0|I always like the Wizard of Oz movie, but it was never one of my favorites and after Alice in Wonderland(wasn't a big fan, except for Johnny Depp) I wasn't expecting this to be very good, but I was happily surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  The movie had a lot of great humor and the entire cast did a great job.<br /><br />Acting 5/5<br />All the actors did a great job, but my personal favorite was James Franco.  Franco played Oz extremely well, and really pulled me into the movie, and he really made me a much bigger fan of the Oz movies.<br /><br />Story 4/5<br />The story wasn't extremely complex, but it was enough to get the point across. I think it was a great way to show how Oz was introduced into the world of the same name.<br /><br />Effects 4/5<br />The effects were well done, not as good as something like Avatar but they did very well at showing what Oz looks like using modern day special effects.<br /><br />Overall Movies 4.5/5<br />I really enjoyed this film, and would recommend it to everyone, especially those that enjoyed the original, or people who are fans of other Disney fantasy films.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I first discovered Blood In, Blood Out in the bargain bin at Best Buy. It looked like a generic gangster movie without much appeal, but I decided to give it a shot anyway since it was so cheap. I had no idea it would become one of my all-time favorite films. Watching it for the first time was an incredibly epic experience. I found myself completely enamored in the story from the very beginning and my attention did not stray in the entire 3 hour runtime. The film builds and builds into an intense climax that chilled me to the bone.<br /><br />The film tells the saga of the three men you see on the cover. Miklo is a half-white half-hispanic young man who has been struggling with his racial identity his entire life. He moves back to East L.A and gets involved with his two cousins in local gang turf wars. We follow the stories of these three men across the decades as they face struggles and hardships on their journey through life.<br /><br />The film is dense with heavy themes of death, pride, sacrifice and redemption. Not only is it entertaining, but also thought-provoking and deals with very controversial subject matter. You will have a lot to think about in the days after watching this film, and believe me it will stay with you that long.<br /><br />Since this is an Amazon review I won't go into any further detail of the plot or themes of the film. All I can say is that it is a monumental achievement in cinematic story-telling and deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as Goodfellas or even The Godfather.<br /><br />Also, any chance of a blu-ray release in the near future? That would be nice!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Easily the best Quentin Tarantino movie to date, great story and great acting.  This movie reminded me of all my favorite Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns from the 60's and 70's.  Personally I never felt like there was a dull moment in the entire movie, between the action and the dark humor you will keep wanting more.<br /><br />Acting  5/5<br />The entire cast did a fantastic job with this movie, but I was the most impressed with the job Leonardo Dicaprio had done.  Leo has had a wide range of roles, but not one quite so evil as his character in Django Unchained. I thought it would be hard to hate my favorite actor in a movie, but it didn't take long before I hated Leo's character.<br /><br />Story  5/5<br />A very original story line featuring strong characters, dark humor, and a touching revenge/love story.<br /><br />Effects 5/5<br />Like most Tarantino movies this film features a lot of blood and killing, but it works in into the movie very well, even adding humor into the fighting scenes.<br /><br />Overall Rating  5/5<br />One of the best movies of 2012, I highly recommend this to anyone, especially people that enjoyed the early spaghetti westerns and other Quentin Tarantino movies.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I absolutely love pinterest! best thing invented so many diy things. Healthy and bad food recipes. Things to do with kids. Party ideas. Home ideas. The list goes on and on!
0061733199|1.0|I was quite looking forward to getting this book until what I actually found in the mailbox was the tiny gem version.....  Quite a letdown.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This is a good alternative to VLC player for my HP Touchpad.  I've been using it to stream from my home computer while im away and it works well
B00AOOX6TY|4.0|It's a pleasant movie to enjoy with the kids without wanting to pull your eyes out. The 3D graphics were so-so. I've seen other animation films that had better 3D aspects. But overall it was good.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|its a bit buggy  but I think it still has a little potential.  it works sometimes and it might be ok to have as a back up to Pandora or Iheart
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Great.  I also had an n.d.e. in nineteen sixty eight.  This book best describes my experience.  Heaven is beautiful with an all encompassing love.  I didn't talk about mine for years, fearful of ridicule.  My illness was encephalitis or brain fever,but I was never pronounced dead.  Thanks so much for writing this book.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|Solid on story, not based on gadgets or special effects, Great Movie!  My bond was Roger Moore but this is a good movie!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is one of my favorite games to play. For one, you don't have to spend money to get the dragons. There is a way to breed each of the dragons that cost gold. You can also gift gold to your friends, so if you are patient, you can save up for what you want without having to buy the gold with real money.<br /><br />  Another reason this game is a favorite, things don't \\"spoil\\" if you leave it too long. I really hate that about most of the other games from this developer.<br /><br />  I do have an issue with their updates. They don't update the kindle fire at the same time as the rest. It is very frustrating when you see your friends with all the other Dragons and buildings that you can't access. That is the only reason I took off stars. When they update everything, I will edit it and give it five stars.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|Westworld is one of my favorite science fiction movies. It isn't too long and I find it entertaining. The actors do a good job.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The author has a laughably small vocabulary and I had to laugh at how many times the same tired adjectives were used. She clearly has no concept of how to write dialogue outside of the bedroom. I got this because of all the hype, but was sadly disappointed.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|This works very well for light cleaning and especially helpful for an elderly person to use.<br /><br />Highly recommend this for quick pick up.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|I really liked this game at first. but then I notice that it takes for eeeeeeever to get enough money to buy new buildings. and you cant get gems without buying them. the graphics are great but the last straw was when it started over. I almost had enough money to buy the next house!
B00B99KJR0|5.0|It's a lot of fun. The puzzles are challenging and the story is a classic. it's like reading a book while playing a game :)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is not Grisham' s best but, the twists and turns in the story kept me going until the end.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I understand some people won't enjoy this comedy, but the majority will and I would highly recommend this movie for a good laugh.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|It had a good story line - good vs. evil.  My son is 16 and even he enjoyed it and thought it funny.  Young kids may be frightened by boogeyman and his black horses.
B003719G40|5.0|Its very hard for me to read and keep concentrated on what the book is about, but this book pulled me in and i have almost finished reading it.. I love it
B004W1GCNC|3.0|I thought this was going to be like Downton Abbey and its not. it may be more appealing to a different era.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Way quieter than stock fan. &#34;Just typing this to make the the comment long enough to submit&#34;....Why does it make you type a min.
B0057ZAA6W|5.0|Great movie. Everyone should watch it so they have a realistic perspective on heroin. Very entertaining movie for sure. Worth buying without a doubt
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I loved the first season so much that I just assume the creators of the show, just wouldn't be able to keep that tension and excitement going throughout the second season. But I was so wrong! I was so riveted, that it took me five days to see the whole second season. The only thing I hate is that they create these fascinating and charismatic characters and then just when you've come to like them, they get killed off. But that is also part of what makes this show so good! I was holding off on doing this, but I might actually have to read the books.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and this book definitely doesn't disappoint! Even with a 4-month-old active baby girl I found I just had to make time to get to the next page.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Good condition even though I bought it used. Worked as expected with no problems. I was finally able to update my Kindle.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|served its purpose, I like that it is a usb unlike the orignial charger for the kindle fire so therefore im able to connect right to my computer
B0070Y46UY|4.0|There is a new book that you will soon be reading and deciphering. \\"LIFE OF PI\\" is a long, sometimes plodding read, but then, Pi' s journey was long and sometimes plodding.<br /><br />It is the circumstances of Pi's survival with a Bengal tiger-- and the shocking twist at the end-- that will have those reading for school or for recreation dissecting and debating this slow-moving but beautifully crafted novel that perfectly lives up to its hype.
B00B23O96A|4.0|First of all let me say...those expecting Slowhand are still stuck in the 70's.Although its not classic Eric Clapton its easier on the ears than reptile or pilgrim....it grows on me the more it seeps in. Some songs like ...All of Me is a distaster. Perhaps because Paul Mcartney is on it. Still got the blues is good,thanks to the late Gary Moore and with help from Steve Winwood. I think this album will sit on many shelves but for me its a weekly listen. Dont be too hard on it...there is a lot worse out there...believe me.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It does not do much unless you get the full version but other wise it's a good app it's more for one time event where you can delete it after its been used
0984725113|5.0|This book made so much sense; how things are happening so much more quickly and how humans are being &#34;left behind&#34; in many cases because their skill sets are no longer needed.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Slow but very customizable park building simulator. Didn't like the money options but there's lot to do without. Free can't complain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games and very very f ubn t o play I will play this for ever and I love it
B000FA5TTW|5.0|A descriptive journey that takes your heart through more ups and downs then a rollercoaster. Really makes you think about the people in your life

B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Indy alternative pop - The title says it all.  Best tracks are Royals, The Love Club and Bravado.  But really they are all a treat.<br /><br />Icing on the cake -- she's 16 so we can all look forward to many more wonderful songs.<br /><br />Go Ella!<br /><br />(You can preview the songs on SoundCloud -- search for \\"LordeMusic\\" -- then buy and support)

B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Ive tried 5 times and each time it says that there is an error while downloading it. Very dissapointed that my kindle fire couldn't download this fun game...
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Purchased this for our 8 and soon to be 4 year old without seeing it in the theater first. Awesome movie! The adults were definitely surprised!
B000FIMHJ4|5.0|Poison at their best!Poison has always been a favorite band and I still have the original record with the original cover.This is kick ass rock n' roll at the best.This has some of their best work overall from start to finish with one hell of a infectious rockin ride that covers all emotions from livin life to the fullest,tryin to make it on your own,heartbreak,and sex is always good for the soul.You get the classic hits like the best party song ever in Nothin' But A Good Time while keeping the rock train rolling with Good Love,Tearin Down The Walls,and Back To The Rockin Horse.Fallen Angel is another awesome rockin song that the band is well known for and is a reminder of how cold this screwed up world is but to keep tryin to make it no matter what the bastards try to tell ya.Then you have the greatest rock power ballad of all time in my opinion in Every Rose Has Its Thorn.Every Rose Has Its Thorn has stood the test of time as one of the best songs in rock history and is a tribute to excellent songwriting.Bad To Be Good is a more raw rockin song that has a little more bite to it attitude wise and is a great closer.You also get another awesome party rock song in Your Mama Don't Dance which is better than the original version and musically has that classic feel good vibe to it.Bottom line this is one of the milestone rock cd's that is a 10 out of 10 masterpiece from one of the best bands around.I highly recommend Poison-Open Up And Say...Ahh! to all rock n'roll fans out there that want a pleasure experience musically that will satisfy your rock fix for all time.Poison Rocks!!!
0385528752|5.0|[...]    I've been thinking a lot the last few years about the uncertain times we live in. As an accidental technologist, I've frequently been asked (or pushed, even) to be a change agent within large organizations and small. I wouldn't say I've always been successful, no matter how many late nights I put in, or innovative ideas I thought up. Not even big budgets or talented folks have been a guarantee of success. I've found myself asking, often,  in these transitional times, how do we get over uncertainty and \\"analysis paralysis\\" to support change?  Wondering and research led me to SWITCH, How to Change Things When Change is Hard, by Chip Heath and Dan Heath.  The theory Heath & Heath espose is that the brain is hard-wired to respond to uncertainty, conflict, and chaos with visceral precepts that make us our own worst enemies. They talk about the brain in metaphor, as a rider on an elephant. The elephant is the emotional, instinctual, feeling portion of our brains-while the rider is the rational analyzer. We live through the combination of both. We need both elephant and rider to move us ahead.  Their script for guiding change is a combination that begins with appealing to the rational rider, removing blocks that cause panicked over-analysis and stagnation by simplifying the critical path to change and identifying the where and what of the destination. Let me say that again, simplifying. (Geez, I have sucked at that). Second, by naming the feeling that joins the elephant's animal instinct to a cause, working to make change feel manageable, and by investing in people's need to enjoy accomplishment along the way.  The Heath brother's true gift is the way they've melted down stories presented in a very Malcolm Gladwell-esque sort of way to (following their own philosophy) meted steps. I found myself in moments of I-could-have-had-a-V8 head slapping, and realization that of course, a transition I was advocating didn't work. <<DUH>> I also wondered why I had not consulted friends who are psychologists and sociologists for guidance on how to be a better advocate for change. As I've thought a great deal about this book, I've also begun looking for success stories around me which mirror the wisdom in addressing rider and elephant...perhaps, more on those, another time.  So, I'll leave you with this-if you're thinking about transitions in an organization, a group, your own life, or society in general, SWITCH contains some insight and armor I think we may all need in the days ahead.
B000001FO4|5.0|Cinderella at their best!Being a Cinderella fan from the beginning I can honestly say this is their best done work musically with all the heart&soul of one kick ass rock cd.Cinderella was more than just a hard rock band and proves it on Long Cold Winter with a southern rock influence that is a unique and infectious welcome addition to the metal scene.You get Comin Home which is one of the best rockin country songs ever along with the title track Long Cold Winter that will set your blues fix on on hell of a rockin satisfaction ride.You Don't Know What You Got(Till It's Gone) is one of their best power ballads ever as well for the slower song.Bad Seamstress Blues(Fallin' Apart At The Seams) is another great song to kick off the cd that has the total influence of the rock,blues,and country.You also get the classic straight up rock songs in Gypsy Road,The Last Mile,and Take Me Back which will remind of the good times and living for the rock n' roll.Second Wind and Fire&Ice are both more raw rock songs that show the band can still kick it into high gear when need be.My favorite song on the cd If You Don't Like It(I Don't Care) is a reminder of sticking to your guns,doing things your way,and not taking any s*** from anyone.This is one complete music masterpiece of a cd from one of the best bands around.Bottom line Long Cold Winter is a 10 out of 10 rockin music ride that is musically one of the best rock cd's ever done.I highly recommend Cinderella-Long Cold Winter to all rock n'roll music fans that what to add a milestone of greatness to their music collection.Cinderella Rocks!!!
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|I am sad that this is the last season, I still yearn for more. The product came on time, sealed and in new condition. I would recommend this product to other GG fans.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|Feel asleep in this one.  Moved too slow.  Did rewind and watch the end.  Best part of the show. May try to watch again, just in case it was me being sleepy and not the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is the greatest game i have played. The game is like temple run. Subway surfer takes you many places such as rome, rio, ect. My friends and i always play this game. I belive most ages could be able to play this game.<br /><br />-My name is.......POTATOES!!!!!

B00821OX98|5.0|excellent story line, great characterization, realistic looking aliens.  Love Noah Wylie. Family drama is intense and gripping. Cant wait for next season
B004APVI1G|3.0|There was a lot of hype about this movie, but I found the plot seemed to jump around & at times was confusing. But the 3D was great so I gave it 3 stars for the effects.  If you're looking for eye candy, you can't go wrong. But the plot might leave you asking yourself just what is this about?!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Like the way your not ripped off by having to purchase tokens to progress but have the option to if you want to get places quicker !  Well worth it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!<br />I love horses and loved the idea of this game!!! The creators made the whole game so realistic!!
B002S45V32|5.0|This was a very good movie , it brought back a lot of memories from days of high school , I think most people would enjoy this movie it had some good humor and very good serious parts , truly depicted was high school was like
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Arrived as brand new!..If going to Mars, would want this as a collection. Totally engrossing. Can't go wrong especially for the price!
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|I'll pass and wait till the EXTENDED VERSION comes out...We all got burned on the DVD\\"S than The blu-ray...Not this time
B0034U4QLM|5.0|Ry Cooder and Paddy Maloney team up to give history and the feel of this period of time in America and Mexico, in the Southwest.<br />The music is very cool.  We have Ry Cooder with a very specific song, Nice.  We have Liam Neeson giving us some grand eloquence to a battle march.  All in all a very hearty congtrats to all.  If you like Ry Cooder.  If you like Paddy Maloney.  This is for you.  If you want to be interested in SOMETHING, THOUGHTFUL, then this would be for you.  Good DVD too.
0443069522|5.0|I don't even think it requires any review, it's probably the best anatomy book that a Medicine student can find, although in this version, some aspects have been reduced and summerized, giving more importance on an overall and topological analysis of the body!<br /><br />The shipment was very good, although it wasn't as perfect as it would have been if bought in a bookshop!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark Places is a heart twisting thriller of a murder mystery, written in concise descriptive prose by a very gifted Ms Flynn. Buy it now, but wait for a quiet weekend to read it, because you will not put it down
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I was kind of skeptical because when I read this was a match 3 game I thought I would be bored.  To my surprise I was far from bored! This game adds just enough of a twist to make it challenging and fun, but not too difficult.  The first time I played, I didn't put it down for a couple of hours. The graphics are crisp too. As far as the storyline...I can take or leave it, but it's not bad.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is a nice little clock program.  Not overly fancy, but will get the job done.  Has some basic settings that allow you to make it more to your liking.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Fantastic and fascinating memoir. Highly recommend for women of all ages *and* mean. Comical, insightful, and best of all, intelligent.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|Very much enjoy having this script book. I write for museum theatre work so I enjoy the opportunity to review other writers techniques and research.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|Great movie, good buy, fun times. If you dont like detective mytery films thats a shame because your missing out on a great one.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I re-watched season #1 to bring me back into the mood and then set time aside to truly appreciate and enjoy season #2.  All I can say is love it, love it, love it.  Have read all the books and still want more, too.
1607066017|5.0|really great mash-up of two great genres all of the characters seem to have there own personality and most could prob carry a story on their own. also seems to be a very rich universe that thy could spin a thousand other stories from. I really liked it.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|I loved this app at first but now that I'm buying and downloading more music I want to be able to place the music in a folder on my External SD card. This app however does not let you choose the location where you want your files stored. So, I'm quickly running out of space to download the music files.<br /><br />Not having just this one feature makes me give this one star, even though the rest of the app works pretty darn good.  Come on Amazon get with it and add this one feature!
B005LAII1C|5.0|Great price for everything you got! I can watch it on all devices at home and even was able to download it to my phone to watch when travelling or not home.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Why get this when you can just get a computer version or Xbox version it's good but just not as good. Sure you can get it for a cheaper price but that's just in my opinion.
1442481919|5.0|Great gift set of books for a toddler. Boynton books have wonderful stories and cute illustrations. My grandbaby loves them!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a very wonderful story and show, it is very addictive, the acting and characters in this series are wonderful, and even though we will be missing 3 of the original characters in season 4, I and others sit on the edge of our seats waiting for it to arrive. I loved having the TV Pass and being able to watch it when I wanted.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|If you think this movie is a game, WRONG. The movie is based on FACTS!<br />The movie was shipped fast.<br />This is one of the best movie about GUNS IN REAL LIFE!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. I never knew how to play but this app taught me how. Good game to have while waiting in line or at airport. Its a good problem solver game.
0062082353|5.0|I truly wish I was able to meet this hero! I am very sad that he was tragically murdered after serving his country! Another great book to add to my collection and I highly recommend you purchase it. Shipping was cheap and very fast!!!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I have to say that this book was by far my favorite out of all the Immortal Instrument books that I've read.  I realize that I'm only on Book 4 now and that there are more to come so it will be interesting to see if the other's are able to catch my attention as well as this one did.  For one thing, I could not put it down and I can RARELY say that about every book I read.  when a book catches my attention to the point where I'm aggravated when something interrupts me or I keep stopping my day here and there just to read a sentence or two to find out more, then it automatically rates itself on one of my favorite lists.  The first two books were good, but this one was spectacular.  It was slam full of action, drama, and best of all for myself, romance.  I realize that this review is a short one for me but I honestly do not have much more to say than to sing my praises to Cassandra Clare for a job well done!<br /><br />Reviewed by Sabrina D. Guthrie
B0024FADDI|4.0|Probably the best audio and video quality I have seen of this movie. Does not the commentary that the boomstick edition does though.
0061122416|4.0|Is it a journey?  On the surface, it is a journey....but maybe not.  Small and pithy.  I wish it were clearer in spots but liked it all the same.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This actually my second time reading the trilogy. I enjoy the sex of course, but more over I the story of love, growth, and, understanding.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Starts out with an out-of-work techie wandering into a bookstore...but it's more than that.  What he finds is a mysterious society that is delving into something very confusing. Though not to him!  Loved it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my favorite of the trilogy.  Yes I have read them each three times.  Such a beautiful love story.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|Lots or remix effects (i.e. Skrillex) that may not be to everyones' liking. But still worth a listen, especially after the first couple of times it grows on you. Typical Korn with an electric edge. If I had only one complaint: no lyrics anywhere! I had to go online to find them; yet this is a special CD + DVD edition.
B00BQUUH7E|5.0|Ice rage is fun for kids.Its easy for kids.It's for all ages and genders.Cool characters there are boys and girls.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book that keeps you intrigued from the moment you begin to read it until the book ends.  There never is a dull moment.  Just one episode of excitement and thrill leading to the next episode.  Their lives becoming intertwined with each other. I can't wait to read the next book!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome graphics  I'm addicted! To be honest if I could rate this 1000000000stars I would believe me! Have to get .great job temple run creators
B0006V6TMG|5.0|I like all of his music! This is just one of the many CD's I have of his. Great listening
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Didn't like it . it was to hard to keep up with, but my grand daughter liked the game, she has more engery than I do.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I don't rate games.this one I have too.Amazon very disappointed that this is the free kindle game of the day and it won't. even download to kindle. Its not APril fools yet.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I like watching the dragons growing up and I like breeding different colors of dragons .
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Fun to watch and I think family friendly. You can learn a bit about birds while you are at it
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|As a VERY casual pc gamer I was simply looking for a mouse that was better than the standard ones that usually come bundled up with a desktop.  I recently built my own computer and chose this mouse based on the look/price/customization.  I generally only play RTS games or FPS and this mouse does everything I need and then some.  I only have a few of the buttons actually programmed but that's enough for me.  I guess my only issue is that I sometimes accidentally press some of the buttons with my thumb.  Most likely it is just because I've never had a mouse with buttons there and I need to get used to it.  The mouse was plug and play and I only had to download the latest software/drivers from their site which was very easy to do.  This no hassle, stylish, user friend, mouse has great value and I am very happy with the purchase.  Will definitely recommend this product and will look for more products from this company in the future!
B0019X3ZZY|3.0|This film was pulled from the public library and several surrounding university libraries. It is disturbed, not well done, and partly credited with prompting the director's murder.

B0034G4OYK|2.0|Not sure if I like Sony anymore for videos. The movies look great but downloading it a big issue especially when you want to use iTunes. We have to download some sort of Utlra something to see it on your laptop but you can use iTunes. I'm going to look more closely when I order a combo now.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Wonderful games, the next thing I know hours have gone bye.  That let me know I am having fun.  Lot's of fun &amp; choices to make, never a dull moment.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|Was thrilled to find this on DVD.  Back in the 70's saw the show on Broadway and was one of my favorites
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|It is a very good show and I highly recommend it. The characters are very compelling and interesting. Check this out

0142000663|5.0|A Classic- what more can be said? Held up as an author who had great awareness of human nature and what happens in life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers has become my new temple run, and it is awesome. It has so many cool features. I also like how it changes where you are in the game like Rome and<br />New York. It is just so uniquely amazing.

B00006LI4S|3.0|I enjoy some of the music on this dvd but not too excited about it in general. He's a great performer but would be more attuned to other song selections.
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|Nice to get this on Vinyl again looks great, sounds even better than my digital downloads and CD's. Also a nice collectors package
1594202710|3.0|An informative book written by an expert on the subject, brings an insight into the history and development of one of the world' super powers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app helped me with my homework and to do other stuff. I think you should get this app! IT WORKS PERFECTLY.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. It moves along a bit slowly but is relaxing. You can walk away and have new<br /><br /> coins to play with when you return. It could be improved if the coins regenerated faster.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Each book kept me interested not being able to put it down. My live life with my husband has also been more interesting since reading the books. Mr Grey have us some fun ideas to try!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its awsome I can't  Believe how cool it is most completely  5 Stars!!!  &hellip; I love it so does my sister  and Dad!<br /><br />Hannah

B008HK3XOU|1.0|I hate this product and plan on returning it.  It made my device hot, the top flap started to bend just hours after using it, and it isn't strong enough to prop the device up for very long.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It really sucked I never want to read it anymore not even bit because it sucks so badly yea boyyyyyy
B00B99KJR0|5.0|After the download issue was fixed, the game was great!! Thanks for fixing it.<br /><br />Original review here:<br />Like the other recent reviewers, this game won't download onto my Kindle Fire. It seems to be on the Cloud, but when I try to download to the device, it does not work (exclamation mark in a red circle). Glad I read the other reviews so I know it's a common issue.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Okay, I accept that ads come with free apps, but I am suddenly getting ads for &#34;singles&#34; ? Get real, I'm a happily married senior citizen. And, the ads aren't inconspicuous at the bottom of the screen, they come up when I try to start a new game, cover the screen, and I have to leave the app to get rid of it. I am deleting this Solitaire app.
B00B23O96A|3.0|OK, you got the obligatory pun. Now let's get down to business. EC's solo studio albums (excluding the one movie score)fall clearly into three categories. They appear in his catalogue in about equal quantities, and rather evenly distributed throughout his career.<br />1.Primarily blues (\\"Money & Cigarettes\\", \\"From The Cradle\\", etc.)<br />2.Primarily rock  (\\"Slowhand\\", \\"Backless\\", \\"Behind The Sun\\", etc.)<br />3.Sentimental balladry with little lead guitar (\\"August\\", \\"Clapton\\", etc.)<br />\\"Riding With The King\\" and \\"Road To Escondido\\" were basically BB King and JJ Cale albums which included Clapton.<br /><br />This CD falls cleanly within category #3-a combination of the \\"American Songbook\\", mellow reggae a la \\"461 Ocean Blvd.\\", and a little blues (Leadbelly). A bit overproduced, great musicians but very soft. I prefer the blues.<br /> As a young man, Clapton had little confidence in his vocals, until John Mayall made him sing. EC has become a decent vocalist, but he doesn't have the chops of the great standup pop and jazz singers-he's a guitarist with a decent voice, not a classic crooner. Maybe some of these tunes (\\"All Of Me\\", etc.) would have been more palatable in more of a jazz style, like McCartney's \\"Kisses On The Bottom\\". Actually, I find the use of Clapton's kids a bit 'homey'. He's on his own independent label now, and doesn't face record company commercial pressures. This one's mellow-perhaps the next will feature more grit.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Other than Night over Water, I love everything he's done. But now to wait another year?  If you love historical novels, you'll love this trilogy!
B00003CXA6|5.0|As you read all the other reviews I happen to agree with them, great for a family to get together and watch history.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My favorite type of book in the world is the \\"I'll just read one more chapter, oh crud it's 3am\\" read.  Wool is EXACTLY that kind of book.  You'll find yourself gripped in the story late at night.  It's perfectly paced and set up to suck you in to the world.  The entire world of Wool is well thought out and fully congruent - it all makes perfect sense and doesn't feel constructed, it just feels real.  This is a MUST READ for any sci fi, or general fiction fan.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|Honestly, I'm shocked.  My son and I laughed quite a bit at the first movie, and still bring it up now and then (usually by simply saying \\"flebby\\"...).  I expected something a little more dumb and silly, something I'd \\"tolerate\\", but I still couldn't resist it.  I'm so glad that I picked it up!<br /><br />First the movie is a little different mostly around Johnny English himself.  He's been in Tibet training with Monks to become more in control of himself - but it's still Johnny English so he's pretty easily distracted and silly.  My favorite scene in the entire movie is a chase scene that I relate to the old \\"Pepe Le Pew\\" cartoons, the guy is jumping around, over fences, between buildings - but Johnny is using his training to remain wise and follow him through more conventional means (instead of scaling down the building the way the guy that he's following is doing, he simply takes the elevator).  I laughed out loud at every turn, much to my surprise.<br /><br />There's another long chase scene where Johnny is in a special wheelchair that can go 60MPH.  If you watch the extras, you'll see that this thing was for real and not all of the high speed parts were done with a stunt double!<br /><br />Last - watch the credits!  There is an AWESOME scene that they cut from the movie to add to the credits, and they did a great job with it.  He's cooking and cutting items to the sound of music, and Rowan Atkinson's perfect comedic timing shines through in this scene - it's a must watch!<br /><br />Honestly, if you enjoy this type of humor or especially if you saw the first one and liked it, do yourself a favor and get this movie.  Now that I own it I know I'll be re-watching it now and then when I need a good, silly laugh.<br /><br />-D
B00B23O96A|1.0|It seems that when the great artists acquire their reputations they degenerate into middle of the road trivia or worse. Even the genius of Trane and Miles was diluted in their later works with burps, loud noises and squawks. Eric Clapton is one of the greatest guitarists of the era, yet he subordinates his talent to smaltz. Eric must be getting old. I know I am. I remember Desrali Gears.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This is one of, if not my favorite, all-time movies.  Made in 1973 and directed by Hal Ashby, Harold and Maude is a gem among gems.  Every time I see it I find something new.
0307352153|5.0|I started out intending to share it, but after reading it I decided it needed to be on my own bookshelf, so bought another.  I have given it to two people who also are enjoying thinking and talking about the insights they gained from it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy playing Bingo Blitz and it allows me the same alternatives on my Kindle Fire as it does on Facebook.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|likenew,great price it was shipped on time and was brand new.writing this big review for each purchase really sucks, however!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it!!! Cant get enough!! the 3rd season believe it or not is even better than the first 2!! I've been catching up with the series, and just can't stop watching!!!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|High quality.  Works as advertised.  Used it to get charge on an iphone 5 from the built in ipod cable on a 2009 Infiniti G37.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This seller is providing FAKE products. My case cracked soon after my purchase so I contacted LifeProof for a new one. When I provided the serial numbers on the front and back case, they told me it is a counterfeit. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Thank you for an excellent movie on all levels.  A story well worth telling and such a good reminder to us all how volatile the Middle East is and has been and more importantly; our involvement in it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It's a great game, but the necroa update has been put off a while for the kindle. This is the only device w/o necroa
B0041CGP02|5.0|Forgot I purchased this one.  I need to find time to search for it.  I have stacks and stacks of CDs.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  You can waste a lot of time doing this when you could be doing something else.  Lol
B003L77G10|2.0|I lost interest in this series and did not order more seasons.  have not had time to watch these right now.
B0063GORYU|5.0|THIS CARD GAME IS ADDICTIVE. ONE MORE GAME, ONE MORE GAME, PLAY IT MANY TIMES A WEEK... I HAVE IT ON MY KINDLE FIRE AND MY DESKTOP... LOVE IT...
B00005R23S|5.0|I like this and have played it many times.  I have also given it as gifts to other people who liked it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book is a modern classic!  It has a satisfying balance of humor, realism, and fantasy. Like Mark Twain and Harper Lee before him, Mathew Quick creates unforgettable characters who speak intimately and truthfully to the reader. I had read half of the book before I saw the film.  I finished the the book the next day. The book far surpasses the screenplay.<br /><br />Thank you, Matthew, for writing such wonderful books!
B003FSTN52|3.0|This is very popular but as I stated,  l lost interest.  Perhaps I shall get back to them.  Lack of time.
B0028IDXDS|3.0|the picture is a lot cuter than what it actually is, although it is still cute. Its also a lot smaller than what it looks like online. The pacifier isn't the best quality. Took way too long to be delivered, because of that alone I will never order from this seller again. If I saw this product in the store I might buy the other animals, but not worth the shipping and waiting since its not the greatest quality.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Eric Clapton is a favorite of everyone.  I like him and have purchased most of his cds.  Too many words required.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|When I was asked to review the DB Tech film slide and negative scanner I jumped at the chance. My husband used to own a scuba shop and teach diving and has a ton of slides that we wanted to convert. We also had a bunch of negatives we wanted to change to digital.<br /><br />The scanner is very lightweight and easy to use. You do need to buy a memory card, the cables that came with it seem only to connect to the computer only for power. We read the instructions and don't see anyway to transfer the image directly to the computer with the memory card.<br /><br />The scanner has a small camera that takes a picture of your slide or negative and then you save it and move it to the computer, or leave it on the card. Negatives took a little jiggling but came out really clear. Slides were a little lacking in the dimension dept, just a little flat with the color and depth.<br /><br />This scanner comes in at a great price point, you can get one that costs much more but once you do all your negs and slides, and then do your family and friends, you're kind of done, so this is perfect for the price point.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|You are requiring too many words for Bruce Springsteen.  He is the Boss and I like all his CDs and so does everyone else.
B008DVJMAW|5.0|How are these guys not all over the radio. . . awesome CD. . . saw them opening for Zac Brown. . . they are even better live!!
B0000025KI|5.0|I like it. All of his CDs are good and I listen to all of them.  He is the Boss.
B008476HBM|5.0|I like the story line and the period of which it is written, I like historical fiction - facts with a touch of imagination.
B005GVW05Q|3.0|Not one of his best CDs.  However, it is all right.  I play othr CDs of his but not this one often.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|This app will not install on my kindle fire. Says download failed after taking long time to download. I am very disappointed because I was really looking forward to playing.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I play this one often.  I have given it as gifts to several people.  Springsteen is number one in surveys.
B0000057D8|5.0|Beautiful performance..I recommend it highly.  No matter what mood you may be in you listen to this piece by Bach and you find hope renewed.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|I like Bruce Springsteen as does everyone else.  I play them frequently.  He is the Boss and everyone buys them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is as an excellent game for children. It is a fun and thrilling game to beat your friends in.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I think the series would be better without Red John.  I am tired of Red John stories in this series.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|I hated this book!!!!!!!!!!!:p.  :p  :p this book is poop crap poop crap poop crap poop crap poop crap poop crap!!!!!!!! Omg why is this book so boring??????
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I like this series and will probably purchase the balance of them.  Time is getting to be a problem to watch all these TV series.
B0025KVLS8|5.0|I just love Beatles, and this is one of their best LP! It is still a pleasure to listen to after all these years.
B003NWS5AO|5.0|I like Robert Plant and Allyson Kraus.  I have several of their CDs. You are requiring too many words.  I am tired.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Beautiful, human, humorous and intimate story of an amazing man and his courageous steps toward fully living his life.<br />A true picture of what intimacy and vulnerability mean...and the beautiful results of taking those risks.  Simple, touching, outstanding performances by all the actors make this a must see.  Adult subject matter.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I am inlove with this game and it very cool to look for clues too.Plus you can pick ypu own person to look for clues.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is a simple and true review.  This workout delivers.  You do the work...you will get the results.  Fabulous, fine and fit results!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is the best book I've ever read. It changed my perspective of everything.<br /> PLEASE READ THIS BOOK YOU WILL LOVE IT
B00ALCBU4M|2.0|It starts as a good film, but soon you will see major flaws in German tanks, uniforms inconsistencies and overall bad plot lines with unbelievable scenes that would normally get ANYONE killed in enemy territory.
0385336810|5.0|My favorite Sophie Kinsella book.  I laughed all the way through it.  I also like the romance that she puts in her books.  The happy endings keep me buying her books too.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is an awesome movie!  The kids like it because they like video games (who doesnt...).  If you grew up in the '80s you will enjoy the references to some of the games (Qbert, Pac Man, Roadblasters, etc).
0385342063|5.0|I love the humor in it and of course the romance.  Sophie Kinsella writes so many hilarious scenarios.  I can't wait for her next book Wedding Night.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I actually really like the game, I've played it on other people's phones. But, I bought it here and it won't install on any of our phones (two Galaxy SIIIs and a Nexus) or on our Xoom tablet. It says they're compatible, but I get an installing error every time. I have tried it several times on each device. I'm very disappointed.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|it's a solution in search of a problem.  this probably won't get posted because they make me post a bunch of words in order to make the comment that the product was duly developed and developed by the department of redundancy department
B00BNNJHXO|4.0|I have been a Soilwork fan for about 15 years, and have liked about all of their material, with a little more emphasis on the earlier stuff. This is a great Soilwork release, if you like the band, or the genre, you will at least like or maybe love the album. They are probably the masters of the Gothenburg genre at this point. The only weakness one might have of this album would be that there is so many tracks released here and very little variation in any of the songs. They are doing what they do best and very little else, but that isn't a bad thing.
B0074MZSWW|2.0|I heard Hang Loose several times on the radio and loved it.  Also loved Always Alright from SNL. I was excited to get this album.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed to find out Always Alright is not on this album.  The only song I like is Hang Loose.  Hold On is the second best on the album and it is just ok. Everything else on the album is slow and just doesn't have that punch. Wished I would have listed to clips of the songs before I bought the album.  I can see why people are so excited about this band...because they are only playing their good songs on the radio and tv circuit.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Works greats, have no problems with it & I like it. Hopefully I'll use it more :) :) :) :)
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I was looking forward to this movie but didn't know what to expect. The storyline was reasonable enough, but there were many gaps and inconsistencies. At the end, I was somewhat disappointed as I didn't find it quite believeable. John Travolta tried, but his character was lacking in many respects. This is not Oliver Stone's best work. It seemed like it was hastily done. Good ideas, but too many gaps and lack of character development.
B00942X8PY|5.0|If you like puzzle-games, or know someone who does - this is the one to have as part of the collection!<br />Not only is it inviting, challenging, etc. It is clever in it's design. I almost feel like it makes me think differently. Strategically plan how the &#34;Brix&#34; should be laid out optimally. Although it is only 2D - as the puzzles progress in difficulty, the variety of colors and constraints keep it so fresh, I am starting to believe that the combinations may be endless!<br />There are 2 modes: Puzzle Mode and Zen Mode. In Puzzle mode, there is a timer that keeps track of how long it takes you to solve the puzzle. Do it fast enough, you get a gold rating... silver, bronze followed by nothing if you take too long. Not to worry though - it always feels good to solve them regardless. Interestingly enough, solving the puzzles usually start with an &#34;Ah Ha&#34; - followed by &#34;oops&#34; - and &#34;Why didn't I see that before?&#34;. Even if I &#34;fail&#34; miserably, I do it over until I get a Gold rating... thinking maybe I had been smart enough to have gotten it on the first try if I &#34;studied&#34; it well enough- LOL.<br />Zen mode is great in that there is no timer - and you can enjoy the puzzle for what it is!<br />Definitely worth getting, gifting etc. for any puzzle-loving gamer!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I thought it was a great book. I loved the way that it kept u hanging at the very end.
0880793589|5.0|I wore out the first copy. I can't give a higher recommendation than that, but the Submit button won't work unless I'm verbose.
B00ATSBIIG|2.0|I thought this would be fun, but it's a little simplistic. I'm really disappointed that I got it and will be deleting it.
0131479415|5.0|Concise, highly readable text with occasional sidebars that leaven the &#34;pure agile&#34; approach with some real-world considerations. For example, the section discussing when and how individual estimations can work as well as Planning Poker was immediately useful and applicable. I'm still working on the book, but I can already see it becoming one of my &#34;ready at hand&#34; texts.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I set the alarm during downtimes between appointments, and I don't have to worry about missing anything. I'm glad I got it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Highly recommended.  Nice insight from a dog's point of view but the words of inspiration are unforgetable.  a great read
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great Mahjong game with a number of variations. It keeps my interest during long breaks. Worth every penny I spent.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|Enjoyed this book!!! The mentality of survival is strong and which is shared how to overcome any difficult situation! Must read
B00632HWOG|5.0|I don't have enough business email to invest in data service on other devices, so this fills the bill, when needed.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I think I enjoy this book more as a re-read, I can relax and know that the story will work itself out, without worrying about the complications.<br /><br />Richard has not yet fully come to terms with who he is, and just wants to marry Kahlan and return to a simpler life.  Maybe it won't be so simple since she's the Mother Confessor, but still, no more races against death.  Yeah right.<br /><br />Richard's magic is waking up and he has no idea how to wield it.  To save him, Kahlan turns Richard over to the Sisters of the Light, sorceresses from the Old World who train wizards.  Unfortunately, neither Kahlan or Richard knows that home of the Sisters, the Palace of the Prophets is a time-spell, and Richard will be there for 200 plus years!  Also, there are Sisters of the Dark, hoping to open the veil and break the Keeper free.  Richard allowed the veil to be torn when he tricked Darken Rahl into opening one of the boxes of Orden.<br /><br />A new force is sweeping the Midlands - the Imperial Army, and they're out to destroy magic, and are basically just dicks.  Good think Kahlan was trained by her warrior king father, since she helps a ragtag group of young army men fight off the forces.  Too bad there is more evil awaiting her in Aydindril (I'm sure that's spelled wrong).<br /><br />Where's Zedd?  Well Zedd and Adie were afflicted by subtractive magic and are dying.  To save themselves, they may lose their identities, and their magic.<br /><br />Sound confusing?  Yes, but read the book, it is much better than I can possibly explain here.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a challenging game after the first levels. Don't use up your hints! They are hard to get as you reach higher levels.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Society's reaction to mental illness is of interest to me.  Also read it because it was a nominee and winner in the Oscars.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I liked it. Fast paced. Nervous energy. Faster than I've read in a long time. Parts needed suspension of disbelief, but still worth it.
1908117230|3.0|Nice pictures.  But instructions are written such as there are few explanations to the steps needed.. seemed to be telling the readers... just follow the steps and don't ask why..... because this is the way...period.<br /><br />If you are a looking to uncover the mystery of Macaron... this is not the book..  The standard shell recipe can be googled and some of the filling  recipes too.<br /><br />Nice to have as a coffee table book though.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|It's a great little set.  The distances between planets aren't, of course, proportional, but we've had lots of fun lying on the floor listening to the CD and watching them go round.  Good price for what it is.<br /><br />We didn't have any noise issues as reported by some other buyers.  Sure, it makes a noise, but what would you expect?  Doesn't overpower the CD to listen at the same time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I thought this book was great. Very easy to read and distinguish the different time frames. The story of Victoria and her growth as a person was very emotional and heart warming. The ending was beautiful, just the way it should have been. I was very satisfied with this book and will be reading it again soon.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is written in such an interesting perspective that it makes you want to keep reading just to find out more about Charlie's take on life events.  It is easy to loose yourself and feel like you are actually witnessing the events as Charlie would have.  This is a more serious toned book than I had expected but the way there narrative is composed doesn't ever make it feel like a slow paced book.  I certainly recommend!
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a good set and has a high quality picture. The Blu-ray Discs came very quickly which was convenient due to being stationed overseas.
1616550414|5.0|Any fan of the Legend of Zelda would definitely appreciate this book. It has beautiful illustrations. The quality of the book in terms of material and binding is excellent
B008FSCNTK|5.0|No one interprets songs better.  A great addition to my collection.  Also, the art work on the cover is easy on the eyes!
B00A7OIXW6|3.0|wrote this mid review because the package itself came destroyed.. you pay good money for damaged goods..not happy at all
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|While this isn't the 80's Bon Jovi, which is my favorite, it isn't really bad either.  I agree it is way more mellow than I thought it would be but after listening to it repeatedly in my car, it's starting to grow on me & I'm liking more songs, there are about two of them I almost always skip over, but with any new music I always have to listen a few times before actually liking it. This definately would not be one of my favorite albums out of the newer ones he has, that would be Have A Nice Day, but I'm not going to harshly criticize it either like some people.  Bon Jovi always has & always will be my favorite band, I just think maybe next time they should consult the old \\"pizza pie jury\\" like they did for Slippery When Wet, which obviously worked!  That way the public picks the songs, what they want to hear, and no one can complain!  Yeah, right!
B00992CF6W|5.0|See the greet know<br />S one who is my best man this is the greatest game I ever<br />Played Houdini styleGreatest GAME EVER
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Chess Free is an excellent product for players of all levels. I particular like the blitzkrieg responses and the quality of the responses. This game allows busy people to get in a few games without consuming valuable time during the day.I tried other games but most were not compatible with the operating systems or they lack in quality responses. The quality of responses and the response time are a definite plus for anyone who considers this game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Amazing game  I love it it is the best game ever<br />I wouldrecomend this game to.kids above the age of 10
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|I had a relative who lived with Parkinson's for over 10 years in our home.  It was, to say the least, VERY challenging.  This movie uses humor and real-world human desires and ambitions, plus what appear to be experiences from patients that have the disease, to explore what can and cannot be done with the disease, what commitment is needed to be the partner of somoene with Parkinson's, and what levels of treatment can be expected.  And yet, the movie doesn't seem to be about the serious topics I've listed here, or at least not just about them.  It is primarily a love story, an exploration of a male-female relationship.  It is also about what the drug industry does right and where it falls down.  It is about what movtivates a person to be a doctor, or to give up on being one.  It can poke fun at situations and issues so that we don't take them too seriously, but inside we know we have to think about them and worry about them, even while we are laughing.  In my opinion, Anne Hathaway gave a tremendous performance.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Really interesting game to play, but see no need to actually pay for things with real money when you can plenty.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love it, love it, this book was never boring.i would luv the entire collection on my kindle.the best book i read in a long time

B0086700CM|1.0|run run run bam your gone make it more real please and you are not IN the temple boo boo
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|good movie, fun characters. Some language is a little more mature that I thought for Disney (&#34;Shut Up and Drive&#34; song), but most times they got nicely creative. Some good lessons on character, and individual's value. Very entertaining.
B009439HEY|4.0|last of the Genesis gang still recording . This album is a tribut to that music. Wish it could have beeen a bit mor imaginable like &#34;Revisted I&#34; where Steve deviated from the original score and modernized a bit. He claimed that no need  for that on these tunes because they are already perfect.
6305308659|4.0|an oldie but a goodie! i liked this movie when i was younger and now i enjoy watching it with people that have never seen it. one of a kind i don't know any other movies like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Great book. Excellent writing! I'd read \\"amazing\\". But I'd love to kill her, I'd love to strangle her myself. This book is mind twisting. It makes you love one than hate than switch the whole time. It makes you feel like crazy one sometimes. I never get upset in my emotions reading a book, I never feel angry, and a twist of disgust and a sick urge for revenge. I can also say, you'll be thankful for your husband (or wife) after finishing this. No doubt about it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|im not one to read really graffic things, so i was nervous after hearing what others said about this series.. but it was not bad at all! and the story line is amazing!
B009YG2ND8|4.0|Worked fine a few months ago quit working now works again other than some major frame rate dips when a lot was on screen. Also Amazon appstore lacks ff 1 & 2, dimensions, and no word on ffiv and ffv which will land on Google play within a month.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|great series, better than the movies! its great for kids or adults. It is hard to put down and will keep you going.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It worked a few months ago when I purchased it quit working now works again, but it's still out of date compared to the other versions of Minecraft and you can't mine the red rock.
B003O86FMW|5.0|great series of books. way better than the movies. as always! great for kids and adults alike. i would reccommend it.
B00B99KJR0|1.0|I have been trying for a hour to download to my kindle. I have restarted my kindle several times. it will not download....frustrating.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|pretty good movie. bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he really likes it. i like it but not one i can watch all the time.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|Review above I  am  Grisham fan and was not dissapointed. in this book I will continue rfeading his books DV
B00APUQRPC|3.0|The three main charactors are awesome. That is what got me to watch it in the first place. Im not a baseball fan, but the romance and the humor  kept me in this movie. pretty good!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I absolutely loved Downton Abbey, can't wait for the next season.  You feel like it is so real and that you connect with the people in the series.
B00899F0G8|5.0|this is my favorite series of all time. I have not missed an episode for three seasons now. I get so pumped watching it and then BAM they leave you hanging for the next episode! AH!
B000006045|5.0|I can't believe it took me this long to discover Massive Attack!  I bought this CD mostly for Teardrop (theme song from House) and Inertia Creeps (awesome song).  I'm listening to the CD now and I just discovered that it also has Dissolved Girl (a great song from The Matrix!).  A+++<br />Will DEFINITELY check out more Massive Attack albums!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|This was a great movie! I have bought all the Tinkerbell movies for my best friend so I needed this one for her collection! I watched it with her and it was one of my favorites!

B003O86FMW|5.0|this is the best book iv ever read. Ive red the first book but it is nothing thike this one.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is my new favorite holiday movie for the kids and me! It is the only holiday movie that does not lead my oldest son to ask challenging questions regarding Santa. Adults will find it hilarious too.<br /><br />Even though Elf stars Will Ferrell and it was not made specifically or children, it is completely appropriate for both young and old. My kids (ages 2 and 6) laughed throughout the movie and they were not scared of any of the scenes. This is the only Christmas movie that does not scare my six year old at all. Most of the classic holiday films and TV specials have some scary parts.<br /><br />Elf is both funny and it has a sweet message. I highly recommend it for all ages!
0767812166|5.0|This is one of the best movies EVER made, in my opinion! Of sci-fi movies, it beats almost ALL of the Star Wars movies, which I was NOT a big fan of. I guess it's not a BIG sci-fi film, it's more of a dramatic/love/sci-fi film. It IS my favorite Jeff Bridges film. I agree with a reviewer of the film in '84 who said that Mr. Bridges did an excellent job of being a human, acting like an alien, learning to act like a human! IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THIS MOVIE, BUY IT! If you don't like it after seeing it, give it to someone who would like it, as a gift as it only cost $7
B0055SWM08|5.0|The music is relaxant by...the graphics add to the simplicity and peaceful nature. The puzzles are just challenging enough but not frustrating!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|This book is better than the movie. I just finished reading this and now I want to start it all over
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|a relief to those who dislike what the movie industry had done to horror pictures in the last 30 + years. makes me jumpy not disgusted.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved it it was amazing and awesome it was abventuress and fun cool and my favorite book of all the red  pyramid
B000002GXJ|5.0|eagles really had a wide variety of talent and with it different music styles that could relate to most music lovers. had this on tape when i was in college in the mid eighties that was given to me by a friend and was glad to know it was still available and on c/d.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|The characters are great. I love the humor without becoming silly. The weekly mysteries are always interesting. It reminds me if what I love about 80's TV!
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|The movie was overly long , and as the troup approached the dragon lair , it ended, a complete waste of money.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|I saw the film when it played in the theater last year and was riveted to my seat. Even nature calling me to visit the rest room had to wait. It was Daniel Day Lewis's presence, Tony Kushner's words and , Steven Spielberg's direction that kept me there for nearly 2 ½ hours. This film is - in my opinion - a masterpiece and, like Spielberg's earlier film \\"Schindler's List\\", this film will serve for years (even generations) in teaching student about an important moment in history.  But there are already 155 reviews of the film posted here (and I don't want to repeat what others have said.) I'll concentrate on the DVD and Bluray releases of the film.<br />Amazon has a general policy of grouping ALL the reviews of a film together and displaying them under all the formats. Reviews start when a fil plays in theaters and then often goes to the Amazon Instant (streaming version).  So I often recommend - when posting my reviews - that you sort by \\"most recent\\" first and then look to see which version the reviewer is discussing. This is a review of the 4-disc Blu-ray+ DVD+Digital Copy, but it should guide you in your purchase, I hope.<br />Disney (the distributor of the home video) is issuing it in three different \\"formats\\".  The single DVD contains the film and 9-minute \\"featurette\\" titled \\"The Journey to Lincoln\\" with the major \\"players\\".  The 2-Disc Blueray+DVD just adds another (4-minute) featurette - this one on how they filmed in Richmond Virginia. The only advantage to this version is that you will get higher resolution image.  The FOUR-disc version adds a digital copy but - more importantly - adds a \\"Bonus Disc) with four more featurettes which add still another 53 minutes of background to the film. The longest (at 27 minutes) is \\"Living With Lincoln\\" where we follow the filming from beginning to end with interviews from every one of the major actors plus the producer and Spielberg. \\"Crafting The Past\\" (10 minutes) covers production design and makeup) while \\"In Lincoln's Footsteps\\" (!6 minutes) all too-briefly covers the score but have a great section on how the sound designer located just the right pocket watch to record for the sound of the ticking in the film (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing the answer. These featurettes tend to overlap, slightly, and - though each plays as a separate \\"feature\\" - as a whole they provide lots of great info after you have seen the film. And I highly suggest that after watching them on the separate Bonus Disc, you click on the last \\"option\\" called \\"Credits\\". You see the credits but the visuals on the screen are a nice extra bonus.<br />So, If you just want to see DDL's Academy Award-winning performance, you can just get the single-disc DVD but if you want to delve deeper into the film, you'll want the 4 Disc \\"Combo Pack Super Set\\" (Disney's words; not mine).<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful!<br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"n's Footsteps\\" (!6 minutes) all too-briefly covers the score but have a great section on how the sound designer located just the right pocket watch to record for the sound of the ticking in the film (I won't spoil the surprise by revealing the answer.

B0090SI42Y|3.0|This is a movie that will have a niche following and will have everyone else sitting there wondering what they just saw. The Man With The Iron Fists is entertaining. That's about the best that I can say about it.<br /><br />Plot: Seriously disjointed. At an attempt to make the plot surprising and intriguing RZA overextended himself and created a ton of scenes that do not flow together at all. You can leave this film and come back 15 minutes later only to have the same \\"what happened\\" experience that everyone that sat through the entire movie will have.<br /><br />Acting: This is probably one of the strong points in the film. Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe are both entertaining, even if Crowe is larger than life and his character is one of the awkward points in the story. RZA isn't terrible at acting in this film, but he seems like he doesn't fit well into his character's skin and it was very evident. He seems to have a half asleep expression throughout the film that's distracting and actually takes a lot away from his character.<br /><br />Style and Visual Effects: You'll know 5 minutes into this film if this is something that you are interested in. The \\"kung fu\\" is exaggerated and about as far as you can get from what it would look like/be possible in real life - many punches never connect and many enemies go flying due to said punches. It is similar to kung fu hustle/warrior's way style, but taken another step in the direction of unbelievable.<br /><br />Music: This was actually a strong point in this film. If nothing else if you know RZA's style and you enjoy the music then you'll like this soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall: Entertaining, but I wouldn't watch it again. I feel like there was a lot of potential and talent in this film that wasn't tapped. RZA needs a more simple (it could have been very simple) story line to direct. He attempted to create a film that would surprise and awe the audience. Instead, he created a film that baffled and confused most viewers. Without making a lot of your own judgements on things (not always bad if the plot is explained well) the plot will make no sense at all. There are a few scenes that you sit there wondering what you have just seen.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I've downloaded 5 times, rebooted Kindle twice and it still won't install.  I find it interesting this is happening to others as well all on the day this app is free.

B00846WWVM|4.0|fun to play and spraying the water is fun and saving  the people and town is very to do .
B000MZHW40|5.0|Very heart warming, intense movie, of course it's old so you can't expect a lot but for an old movie it is a very entertaining movie.
B007QUUJMG|3.0|Written as a series of letters - we meet a somewhat unusual high school student 'Charlie'<br />He is a deep thinker, but he thinks nothing of some odd behaviours - the reason for which is revealed when he suffers a breakdown.<br />A bit sad....
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|For lovers of classic movies, film history, docudramas, biographies, and fans of Alfred Hitchcock, the original Master of Suspense, \\"Hitchcock\\" is one of the more intelligent and entertaining films to come out recently.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|You won't be able to leave untill the book finishes.<br />Best fantasy novel I've ever read! Buy it! You'll love it
0312611692|5.0|An interesting treatise on the evolution of man and the advances education and social grouping played in it.<br />The needs and wants of dreamers, scientists and military all played their part in Why the West Rules. For Now indicates the portents of change happening in the global revolutions. Both financial and military, occurring now.<br />I would recommend this to anyone seeking a greater understanding of mankind, his impact on the environment and its on him.
1476733953|5.0|Not since \\"Ender's Game\\" almost 20 years ago have I read such an engrossing SF book! A believable world, populated by believable characters, living their lives in complete ignorance of their true destiny! Enough! You need to know nothing more, except to get this book, and prepare to do little else until you finish it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this and I was expecting absolute tripe.  I didn't think John C Reilly had it in him but he came across as lovable, affable, relatable, and probably other -ables I'm failing to mention.  This is a heart warming story, visually pleasing, this one is firing on all cylinders and reminds me a lot of Wall-E in the sense of a deeply enjoyable storyline and the characters and their context are very well thought out.  Not to sound too ebayish but A+++
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Was appreciated by the recipient.  He expressed great joy in owning a favorite from his childhood.  Is there anything better than Disney movies?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the three books and the first movie. After ready the books I am even more excited about the movies.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|His tone is gorgeous, I love the songs, and his band kicks butt too!  Everyone needs to hear this man's music!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this app sucks it doesn't load and constantly crashes! this sucks even for free it is a waste of money
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I like the album.<br />If you want \\"Cry me a River\\", this won't please you.<br />If you liked Future Sex Love Songs, you will really enjoy the album. Period.<br /><br />JT and Timberland together, make what I will call, \\"Musical Fusion\\".<br />This is music that doesn't fit squarely into a peg. This album and the music on it is too diverse to fit in any one category.<br />It reminds me of other recent albums I purchased such as Kaleidoscope Dream or Blunderbuss.<br />People who want to put Miguel in an R&B box and call it done may have been disappointed, those who thought of Jack White as only a rocker were surprised. (pleasantly I hope)<br /><br />I say all that to say this. JT's album gives an experience not to be judged by his previous works or compared to other music out now.<br />If you're looking for a solid pop album, you won't get it here. Let it groove on you before you dismiss it.<br />With the shortest song lasting over 4 minutes, you can imagine JT and producer Timberland were in the studio being as creative as they wanted to be.<br />Allow yourself to partake in something different.<br /><br />After having the album a little longer now, I have updated my review from 4 stars to 5! Any album that I can say I enjoy 80% or more of the music AND can listen to on repeat deserves 5 stars.<br />Personal Favorites:  My daughter (8) Loves Mirrors and sings I be on my Suit & Tie (ship).<br />I am most caught off by and Blue Ocean Floor which I love and listen to on repeat a few times before cycling back through the album.  Nicely done Mr. Timberlake.
B00ATUEKY8|3.0|At moments I really liked this book for its fast-paced engaging style and novel honest approach to a hugely difficult legal-moral-social matter. At other times, I thoroughly disliked the author's irreverent humour at the expense of her moral integrity, albeit her perceived truths, in how dark and disturbing her life really was, however, throughout you will be spellbound by the sheer brilliance of literary style in a meandering yet cohesive  chronology of life events that climax in an abrupt ending leaving you to draw your own conclusions. This book certainly will shock you out of any ambivalence towards the shocking mental health industry as recent as the late 80s-90s.
1451613512|5.0|This is a book that by its very nature will divide its readers.  It offers an account of twentieth and twenty-fýrst century American history, showing how successive governments have pursued imperialistic aims while neglecting many of its people.  According to Stone and Kuznick, John F. Kennedy was the last President who really cared about America's future; since then the governments have been solely concerned with self-interested, mostly capitalistic purposes.  Some of the stories about government tactics used both to silence and manipulate people are truly horrific; it seems that no one is safe from intrusion.  I found the book absolutely compelling to read, especially its account of the Second World War and how FDR was at once trying to sustain the alliance with Great Britain, placate the antiwar factions within his own country, yet increase American influence in the world.  By comparison more recent presidents, such as George W. Bush and Barack Obama, have lacked imagination; they have preferred to be guided by a series of advisers with specific ideological aims, especially as far as the Middle East is concerned.  The book offers a bleak picture of America's future, and a far from rosy vision of the past.  My favorite story from the book centers around the North Vietnamese, who admitted that one of the reasons why they triumphed over the United States in the mid-1970s was because they understood certain aspects of the American political mentality, after having read American literature and American history.  Stone and Kuznick's book achieves a similar objective; one hopes it will encourage readers, both inside and outside the country, to rethink what it is to be an \\"American\\" as well as assess the country's future status in the world.
