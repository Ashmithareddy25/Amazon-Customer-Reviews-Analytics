B00006RAKP|4.0|I like this compilation of Elton John because it's got a lot of material from different eras, including some songs I had not heard before (I am not a huge Elton John fan, just a sort of borderline one) as well as some favorites. Of course, I do find a lot of his songs to be much too long (like I'm in the car only half paying attention and wait is he STILL talking about hold me closer Tony Danza, get the head lice on the highway)? (yes, I know the real words, but sometimes he's hard to understand.)
0307352153|4.0|I felt that this work covered many aspects of the world of the introvert.  A reader could find a type of personality trait as the author  gave many examples to identify with.  I liked it very much as it helped  identify which type of introavert personality I was and help to give an option  I am OK not strange.

B00ANVX6DY|5.0|My daughter loves this movie.  Great princess movie for the litte princesses!!  I wish there were more Sofia The First Movies.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|I didn't see this movie when it came to the theaters, but I am thoroughly enjoying it now!  All the previous Robin Hood stories were so campy or silly, but Russell Crowe makes this Robin Hood believable, and Cate Blanchett does a wonderful job as Marian.  I'd group this movie with two of my other favorites...Clive Owen's King Arthur and The Gladiator.

B00BF11STU|5.0|An amazing all encompassing journey that traces the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. A much bigger film than Bigelows Hurt Locker but just as well done.
0307744434|2.0|Not too often, a book comes along that would make a way better movie than it is a book.  This is that book.  There is not enough action, and way too much time spent on visual detailing, which would be GREAT if I were watching a movie, but I'm reading, and I want some action.  Instead, I am reading excessive details about what things look like.  There are some very interesting characters, and I like the time frame (late 1800s, early 1900s) of the book, but I am 77% into the book, and still unhappy with it.  I am still waiting to \\"giddy up and go\\".  Even if there is a glorious, fantastic whalloping twist at the end, I have paid too much time for it.  Sorry.

B009GQ57ES|5.0|So, this album really doesn't need another glowing review but here comes another anyway.<br /><br />I bought this album off Amazon on one of their $5 deals, and I must say it's one of my favorite albums of recent. I'm not really a rap/hip hop listener. Actually it may be fair to say this is the first time I've been able to sit through an entire rap album. The reason why? Macklamore and Lewis do an excellent job matching melody and rap to create music. It's not just listening to words being chanted in a rhythm--its listening to words blending into the melody provided. And the melodies used are really easy on the ears.  I think anyone who enjoys OneRepublic may also enjoy this album.<br /><br />Some of my favorite tracks were: 10,000 hours, Thrift Shop,  Some Love, BomBom, My oh My
B003YFIUW8|5.0|My 16-year-old daughter recommended this book to me. I'm honored when she still wants to share with me, so I read it. I've never read a book written with the perspective of a child and I couldn't put it down. This story made me feel many intense emotions and allowed me to have a new poignant discussion with my daughter. Win-win. Loved it.

0544139453|5.0|To an extraordinary degree, this beautifully written short novel brought me into the mind and heart of someone I would not have expected to be interested in, let alone empathize with.  The central character, of course, is young Pakistani who's had a superb American education, and has landed  a superb American job.  Everything (including a superb American girlfriend) seems to be going splendidly, until 9/11.  That shatters his sense of identity, from the inside first -- he smiles when he hears the news, shocking himself profoundly, and begins to wonder who he really is.  The continued unravelling (or crisis of faith, if secular careerism can be deemed a faith) is reinforced by changing American attitudes towards Muslims and the Muslim world.  Eventually -- well, if you haven't read a plot summary yet, read the book to find out what happens.<br /><br />Read the book anyway, even if you know what happens.  The way in which the book is narrated, a long monologue delivered by the Pakistani to a mysterious American in an unsettling Lahore cafe, brought me into an Arabian Nights world of storytelling, judicious pauses, and evocative language. The combination of this form with the very modern subject matter crystallizes the division between the narrator's Pakistani past and his one-time American future, a future now foregone.  The language is crisp and exact, and the author's ability to pin-point (pin prick?) much about the U.S. response to 9/11 is uncanny, and uncomfortable.  Some of his political comparisons -- for example, the way the civilians killed on 9/11 became victims never to be forgotten, while the civilians killed by American drones became collateral damage -- are now burned into my perceptions of my country's foreign policy.  Why do they hate us?  Because we push them around.<br /><br />If this book were non-fiction, there would be things in it that I would criticize, including a tendency to blame everything on the U.S.  (Why do we push them around?  Because, sometimes, they are harming our interests, and other times they are threatening our \\"friends\\". ) But it isn't non-fiction, it's a novel, and a novel is allowed to present one view of the world without making allowances for conflicting points of view.  Moreover, the central character's sympathy with them rather than us isn't really all that inexplicable.  Human beings are tribal, Americans as well as Pakistanis.  Years ago, when IRA bombings were terrorizing London, an Irish-American banker friend of mine was in London on business.  When he heard that another bomb had gone off, with injuries and possibly deaths, he didn't smile.  He did, however, think \\"One for our side\\".  When he told me about this, I was amazed, as I think was he when it happened.  Our pre-civilized emotions rear their ugly heads, even in the financial services industry.ometimes, they are harming our interests, and other times they are threatening our \\"friends\\". ) But it isn't non-fiction, it's a novel, and a novel is allowed to present one view of the world without making allowances for conflicting points of view.

B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Eleanor & Park isn't a literary wonder, but it is a sweet, tender story of young love, ripe with references to the music and styles (and comic books) of the 1980's. Eleanor handles her despicable life with a stoic grace while Park balances being bi-racial (Korean and, well, white). Together, they are honest and bring back memories of the uncertainty associated with high school crushes that develop to what seems like forever, until life moves in.<br />This quick, easy read is entertaining.
0385349947|5.0|Some books generate a storm of criticism as soon as they are published, much of which seems based on reading about the book, not actually reading the book itself.  \\"Lean In\\" is one such book.  The thrust of the book was no secret, since it is based in large part on talks Sandberg gave in 2010 and 2011.  In those she stressed the need for women to \\"lean in\\" -- recognizing that many typical female behavior patterns hurt women at work, that those behaviors can change, and that motherhood doesn't have to mean \\"leaning back\\" at work.  Those arguments, along with Sandberg's extraordinary success, sparked the aforementioned storm of criticism when the book came out.  She was accused of blaming the victim by ignoring structural sexism in American business,and of elitism by discussing issues that had nothing to do with the problems of most working American women.<br /><br />When I actually read the book, I was far more impressed than the brouhaha suggested.  \\"Blaming the victim\\" and \\"elitist\\" criticisms ignore the fact that Sandberg tackles them right from the beginning.  The handicaps women face in the workplace, she argues, reflect BOTH external patterns of discrimination, and internal patterns that women bring to the workplace.  She calls this a \\"the ultimate chicken-and-egg situation\\", and continues \\"The chicken: women will tear down the external barriers once we achieve leadership roles.  ....  The egg: we need to eliminate external barriers to get women into those roles in the first place\\".  Both sides, she says, are right.  Her book is mostly about the chicken, but she clearly thinks the egg is just as important, saying that \\"men still run the world\\" and demonstrating that with lots and lots of statistics.  As to elitism, she address that head on as well, saying that parts of this book \\"will be most relevant to women fortunate enough to have choices\\".  BUT, she adds, other parts \\"apply to situations that women face in every work place\\", and she is trying to offer opinions that will \\"resonate with women in a broad range of circumstances\\".<br /><br />So much for the criticisms: what about the book?  It demonstrates convincingly that women as a group have plateaued in the American workplace for years now, after rapid gains in the 1970's and 1980's -- in terms of earnings, in terms of advancement, and in terms of home/work balance.  It demonstrates that this has happened despite the fact that women are on average better educated than men, all the way up the ladder, and that women make up a growing share of the labor force.  So what's the problem?  Much of it, Ms. Sandberg shows, reflects workplace practices that disadvantage women, particularly women with children.  And much of it reflects attitudes held (often unconsciously) by men AND by women in the workplace.  Most notably, she cites studies showing that men tend to be better liked as they become more successful at work, while women become less liked as they become more successful.  When you consider that success at work has something to do with how well liked you are, that's a great big Catch-22.<br /><br />But the key arguments in the book, I think, focus on the limitations women put on themselves.  As a veteran (female) of almost 40 years in Wall Street, Ms. Sandberg's discussion of this  made me think Right, Right, RIGHT again and again.  She cites the same behaviors and attitudes I noticed over and over  in myself, and in other women at work: Work hard and you'll do well! Don't make waves! Don't blow your own horn! Don't take on more than you can chew!  Why do we women believe this?  Largely, because we are conditioned from babyhood to do so. Yes, there are probably some modest innate emotional differences between the bell curve women and the bell curve man.  Piled on top of that, however (as Ms. Sandberg makes clear), is an extraordinary weight of social assumptions.  And Ms Sandberg has practical suggestions for dealing with these internal constraints.  It took me a couple of decades to understand that waiting to be crowned Queen of the May was not a good career strategies, but I never really worked what to do instead. Ms Sandberg has, and it adds up to \\"lean in\\" -- don't step back, don't underestimate yourself (or if you do, act as if you didn't), don't refuse to speak up for yourself, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />All in all, this is an enlightening book, and is well worth reading.  It's also a feminist manifesto, and that's nice to see after all these years during which no one seemed to want to admit to being a feminist.e of decades to understand that waiting to be crowned Queen of the May was not a good career strategies, but I never really worked what to do instead.

1250012570|5.0|This novel was absolutely spectacular! It had me laughing and crying, sometimes both at the same time. I'm only in 7th grade so I don't have any love experience, but I could feel every single emotion the characters felt. I felt their despair and sorrow, but also their happiness and love for each other. Eleanor and Park is an amazing novel- I definitely would recommend it! (May I just add in that Rainbow is an amazing name and I am super jealous!!♥)
0515149489|5.0|Great, great book.  I really enjoyed this one. Lots of suspense and danger, love.  The main characters Fiona and Simon are terrific and the interaction between them is delightful and pulls you right in.  The interaction was extremely well written so it was believable.  I laughed out loud in some places with the exchanges going back and forth and then in the next moment would be suspense and seriousness.  A definite must read.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great game for the money.takes awhile to build up your ranking and money but worth it.had fun playing every day.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fantastic case & protector.  Very light weight and form fitting, adds absolutely no bulk or weight to the Kindle Fire.  The elastic is a nice touch to keep the case's flap open or closed.<br /><br />The case as a stand is adequate.  It only works at a fixed angle in landscape, and isn't the most stable thing in the world, but it's good enough to plop on a desk to watch movies, which is how most people will use it.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you want to protect your first gen Kindle Fire.

Happy to have it though.

B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|This review is about the 70th Anniversary Blu-ray version (with book). The restoration and transfer to Blu-ray is quite excellent, especially given the age of the B&W film used from the archives. I found nothing objectionable with the gray scale, highlights or deep shadow. The audio is what it is -- good -- given the era in which the film was made. No objectionable extraneous clicks, pops or (especially) hiss. Don't expect the kind of high fidelity that current films have though -- ability to record that didn't exist when this film was made.<br /><br />Don't underestimate the enormous power William Randolph Hearst had, even after the Great Depression had put a major dent in his news media empire, just before U.S. entry into WWII when this film was released. Hearst considered this film a personal affront and did everything he could to kill it \\"with extreme prejudice.\\" It would have likely swept the Oscars had Hearst not launched an all-out attack on Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, severely damaging Welles' career permanently. Hearst tried first to kill the film before it ever saw the light of day. This included an offer to pay the studio, essentially a bribe, to not release it and destroy all the film's negatives and prints. Failing that, he then then limited theaters in which it showed by threatening to *permanently* refuse advertising in any of his newspapers for *any* theater that showed it. As a result, Citizen Kane did not open in New York in the theater it normally would have (the one the studio used for major film releases). For the Academy Awards, he heavily influenced Guild members as he controlled printed reviews of films, directors and actors.<br /><br />\\"Citizen Kane\\" is groundbreaking in its screenplay by Welles and Herman Mankiewicz (the older of the two Mankiewicz brothers), and in Toland's cinematography for which he and Welles had to invent equipment and create methods to achieve -- influencing many films, writers, cinematographers and directors thathave followed. The story itself -- about the rise and fall of a very powerful megalomaniac's newspaper and radio station empire, that by self-proclamation allegedly fought for the rights of the \\"Little Guy\\" -- is compelling and the manner in which it's told on film is powerful. These are the reasons Citizen Kane has endured at the very top of the lists of all-time greatest feature films ever made . . . in spite of all Hearst's efforts to quash it.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My daughters love to watch this movie! They love the stories about princesses! Of course, I love this movie also! Everything about this order was great!!!
B001GCUO52|3.0|This is about the 2-D Blu-ray (I'm not enamored with 3-D as a concept). The Blu-ray transfer is excellent as is the audio. Technically it's a well executed Blu-ray and for that I'd give it five stars.<br /><br />This was touted as the *last* \\"Final Destination\\" (aka FD4) but that means nothing for a film franchise that may still be profitable and so there's a FD5 following this one. It's plenty \\"scary\\" in terms of startling events. The concept, however, is growing stale with essentially the same plot: trying to determine the sequence in which people will die and outwit Death before it claims the last one or two survivors. Just change the circumstances of the original vision containing the mass casualty event, the names of the characters, and the manner of their horrific deaths. Watching these in sequence starts to get boring after FD2. By comparison, I've watched Kurosawa's \\"Yojimbo\\" and Sergio Leone's \\"Fistful of Dollars\\" back-to-back and not been bored by it (Leone cloned Yojimbo nearly scene by scene and was successfully sued). Nor have I been bored watching the \\"Resident Evil\\" series (there's at least a varying story line with continuity through them). Giving this three stars, not for technical aspects of the Blu-ray, but for the film itself. I've got FD5 (bought it about the same time as FD4) and will very likely pass on any more from this franchise unless there's a radical departure from the plot \\"formula\\" that's been used for five films now.

B007ZRZF8I|4.0|I think this is a great game with only minor issues. Don't listen to the other reviews. All they talk about is the one tiny issue about it and they give it 1 star. Hey idiots try taking about the positive aspects of it like how the level design is great and the fact that you can play multiplayer through LAN not &quot;oh this game sucks because you have to pay extra 1 STAR&quot; take my advice, if you like challenging puzzle games that are fast paced, this is for you.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This sequel is a much better movie than the first. Since purchasing, I have watched SHGOS at least ten times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Chain armor is the best get pocketinveditor if you want chain armor if you don't you will regret it forever
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have watched all of the James Bond movies many times. The decision to make Daniel Craig the new Bond was a great choice. Until SKYFALL, Connery was still the coolest James Bond. But, in my opinion, Daniel Craig has taken over as the best Bond. Even my wife, who dislikes most of the Bond movies, loved SKYFALL.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This was a thoughtful, well-written, and enjoyable book. I don't have kids and I'm in academia, not the corporate world, but I still found great career and personal advice throughout the book. The author is extremely aware that she's in a highly privileged position (professionally, personally, and financially) but she does a good job of making recommendations for everyone, regardless of gender, job title, or economic status. Let me repeat: this is a great book REGARDLESS OF GENDER. The author makes the excellent point that in order for our society to achieve true equality, we need to support women *and* men in their career and family choices.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|&#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; was recommended for me to read by my boyfriend and so therefore I decided to give it a try because I trust his judgment. I had average expectations going into the book, but this book blew those expectations out of the park. I simply could not put this book down. It would be a great book for a teen because it's about growing up and the different challenges and choices that average teens face.
B000FA675C|4.0|This is a very entertaining book. If you like drama, murder mystery and suspense, this is a great book!<br /><br />Yes, the movie is great, but the book is better. Worth reading for the entertainment value.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love the my alarm clock! I need multiple alarms to remind me to take my medications throughout the day. My cell only has one alarm which is stupid, its a smart phone for goodness sake. My other phone had 4. So I was happy to see the kindle had an alarm clock!!
0812550706|5.0|I have been reading and re-reading this book over 20 years! I love it, just love it. (I confess that I read this book over 10+ times)<br /><br />It is a sci-fi book, but many walks of life can enjoy it, not just Sc-Fi fans!<br /><br />Worth getting, so go out there and buy it!
B005PK57NU|5.0|I fell in love with this show when my sister told me about it last year. Since then, I've purchased seasons one ans two, and I watched season three through live streaming on amazon. Loved it!
0785151303|5.0|Ordered this for my daughter - an illustrator - she absolutely loves it.  Her husband ordered her the same thing a year ago Christmas for a lot more money and after several delays the order was canceled.  This source provided it on time and in perfect shape.  Can't ask for more!
B005PK553C|5.0|Just the right amount of horror, gore, and sex! The family next store was super creepy and nosey! Loved it!
081243238X|5.0|This was my daughter's favorite book as a child and it was the first book I bought for my first grandchild to be!
1596177373|3.0|I bought it at one of Tim Burton's exhibition, assuming that illustrations are on all of the cards, which they are not. Like other buyers have mentioned, number cards (1~10) do not have illustrations, meaning only 14 out of 54 cards have them. But it is still a good buy if you are a Tim Burton fan and considering its price.
0783225784|5.0|Good movie. Laughing my ass off every other scene, its well worth watching even though it is rated &#34;R&#34;, but that shouldn't scare people.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downtown Abbey Season 3 was a one of the best seasons yet! The Christmas Special was also really good. I can't wait for season 4!
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|This cd is not bad,but his most beautiful duet with Mireille Mathieu \\"you and i\\" is missing.Sorry that is my opinion.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I play games on my PC to the tune of 10-30 hours a week. That is a lot most it the game Shogun 2 so I might have gone overboard buying this product seeing that I really dont NEED so much, but its definitely better to have too much than to not have enough. This is a SUPER GREAT product no complaints except ...it's too much goodness for not a whole lotta money. I WOULD RECOMMEND
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun and if you are a temple run lover than you would love this game . It is a fun thing to do if you get bored
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thanks to The Walking Dead, I can't even enjoy my regular tv programs because they seem to  far fetched. No one is safe in this show which I find more realistic. I've come to care about these characters, so when one of them dies, it's devastating! In the immortal words of Russel T. Davies( former head writer of Doctor Who) drama isn't for everyone. If you want your characters to be in the same predicament every week , look at network television. Great Job! Walking Dead. I will continue to watch.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|This was a Christmas present for my 3-year-old daughter. It did not come in the condition it was described. It was in very bad condition. My daughter was totally let down on Christmas.
B00B04NJI0|1.0|The concept seemed titillating; however, this was just an absolute mess.  The viewer is promised \\"...26 shorts dealing with the ABCs...blah, blah, blah.\\"  So, what you get are basically 26 short films by, oh, 24 directors you'll never hear from again.  Most of the story lines here make little to no sense; some are downright weird, others just plain gross.  However, I did learn something:  I never knew the Japanese were so \\"bowel obssessed.\\"<br /><br />I suggest having shards of glass shoved in your eyes in lieu of watching this.  P. U.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I was initially hooked by Breezeblocks, and did some listening on Youtube to their other songs.  I couldn't find one I didn't like, so I bought the album.  The live performance on KEXP was stellar.  These guys sound just as good live as they do on the album.  Maybe better.
B005XLN97M|2.0|Barbie was swindled out of her $40 when she purchased this beach house.  It is much too small inside to fit the furniture and a few of Barbie's friends inside at the same time.  Now she can only entertain outside....<br />Barbie (and my daughter) would've been much happier coughing up another $40 for a decent home.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I have been an ardent follower of the Lord of the Rings series.  This set will be the final production.  They did a wonderful job in following and faithfully reproducing the novels.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I suppose I should have read it sooner. It would make me realise a few things earlier. Good story but even better picture of a human behaviour. Leadership. Like the pace. Sometimes you can guess what comes next but still very well written. Not only for Sci-fi fans.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|If you are an International Relations major you will really appreciate this story line. The rest of the movie (acting, directing, etc.) has been praised by many and I really can't add much to that.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I thought this book was very well written. I felt like there were plot twists I wasn't expecting. I really couldn't put it down until I was done.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|This season presents great character and plot development. Really does a great job at keeping you hungry for the next season.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I THOUGHERLY LIKE THIS GAME.  IT IS MY FAVORITE AND I LIKE THE WAY YOU PRESENT IT. THE TILES ARE ALSO VERY GOOD.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This alarm clock app hasn't let me down yet! I love that I can pick my<br />own music for the alarms. This is so easy to use, too! Great app.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I ENJOY PLAYING DIAMOND DASH  IT IS VERY ADDICTIVE  THE COLORS ARE GREAT AND IT KEEPS ME VERY BUSY. THANKS FOR THIS GAME.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The only cookbook you never knew you needed. I thought I was a passable cook before this; my friends liked done of the dishes I made, and I felt comfortable in the kitchen. Now, in addition to using the learning techniques on the book to master contact juggling, my friends and family all want me to cook for them. Food is integral for keeping social units of any kind stable, and good food goes a long way towards that end. Thanks Tim for writing yet another life changing book.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Awesome app! So many free books in every category you will never have time to read them all if you live to be 100.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've used this mouse for about 30 hours so far and have very few complaints with it, nothing worthy of anything less than 5 stars though.<br /><br />The thumb buttons are fairly &#34;difficult&#34; to access except for the far back one, I like it because I can map those to buttons to intermittently  used and not have to worry about accidently pushing them.<br />The DPI button bellow your knuckle is a nice place to have it so its not accidently pushed.<br />You map some of the buttons to a keyboard button, works for me, they can all be changed anyway in the software which is easy to use.<br />The feet are smooth rounded corners.  Build quality is great for me.<br /><br />The weight section its decent a foam package to hold cylindrical weights, the cover stays on it fell off once, nothing hitting esc and taking a 10 sec break cant fix.<br /><br />I'm no professional but for a $40 mouse i'd say its well worth it, i've had no problems, no lag, great accuracy and nothing worthy of anything less than 5 stars.  I play mostly RTS and RPG games which the adjustable DPI is VERY useful for depending on what your doing.<br /><br />I have only 2 complaints and that is the cord is too long, mostly because I use portable power out of work necessity, and The Anker is the only part that you can change color on :'( though it is still cool to change the colors I do it to match my backlit keyboard.
B007Q0OUNA|4.0|The actual \\" weathertop\\" structure you build is very small. Kinda funny looking at it next to the giant box it came in. Overall its a cool set,  and would say is a must have for lord of the rings-Lego fans
1439127727|5.0|I heard the authors of this book interviewed on public radio and they were interesting enough to get me to buy the book. I'm so glad I did. This is more than a look behind the scenes, it's a reminder of our history and a helpful road map of how America go to its present place politically. I couldn't put it down, and I intend to buy another copy for a friend for Christmas. It's nice to give a gift you know someone will love. Try this book...you'll love it, too.
B002GJT4Y6|3.0|This review is for the product page titled &#34;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (Four-Disc Ultimate Edition)&#34;.  I ordered a copy of the four-disc set last year primarily to get the extended version of the film. I enjoyed it, but it got lost when I moved to a new home.  So I ordered a new copy, but what I got was not the four-disc edition.  Instead, I got a three-disc version without the extended cut of the film.  Just now I checked out the &#34;Additional DVD Options&#34; section of the product listing, and it lists a wide variety of options, but the four-disc set is not one of them, even though that's the title of the product page.  So I don't actually know if the four-disc set is still available or not  :-/enneth Branagh as foppish blowhard Gilderoy Lockhart.  Branagh has a great feel for the character... it's too bad he wasn't given a better film in which to showcase that.<br /><br />WARNING:  The \\"Bonus Digital Copy\\" that comes with the box set was an offer that expired on 12/8/10.  I went ahead and tried the bonus disc in my Macbook, and it told me I needed iTunes 8.02 or later.  I have 11.0.2, so clearly the bonus disc software doesn't even know how to work anymore.  What's worse, the disk wouldn't eject from my laptop.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH DISNEY!!  BIG HIT FOR THE LITTLE ONES AS WELL AS THE YOUNG AT HEART.  HAVE WATCHED IT OVER 20+ TIMES AND STILL PLAYS LIKE NEW
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book was geared to young readers, maybe teenagers. Lengthy, wordy, took forever come to its conclusion. I think teenagers would like it, but as an adult, I did not.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I PURCHASED OTHER NEW HOLIDAY CDs.  HAVE TO SAY WHITNEY HOUSTON'S 'ONE WISH' MOVE TO MY NUMBER 1 SPOT.  LOVE TO HEAR HER VOICE, WILL ALWAYS MISS HER!
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|\\"Hitchcock\\" is a semi-fictional account of how the Master of Suspense created \\"Psycho,\\" one of the most suspenseful and influential films ever made, under the increasingly difficult circumstances. Filmed with a quirky sense of humor, as seen in the film's opening \\"murder\\" scene, \\"Hitchcock\\" remains entertaining throughout, even though Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock is often (and intentionally perhaps) overshadowed by that of his wife Alma Reville played by Helen Mirren.<br /><br />With period details and effective acting from the stars, Sacha Gervasi's bio-pic keeps the story afloat, but rarely delves into the darker side of the genius filmmaker who chose a Robert Bloch novel about a psychopathic murderer as a follow-up to \\"North by Northwest.\\" Hitchcock's interaction with the character of Ed Gein, inspiration for Norman Bates, borders on pretentiousness or even boredom.<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" attempt to pay overdue respect to Alma, Alfred's collaborator behind the creation of \\"Psycho.\\" It is good to know their unsung collaboration, and the relationship between Alma and Alfred is convincing and often fun with low-key humor, but I don't think the soap opera-ish subplot is the right way to explore their relationship that I believe was more complicated than shown here.<br /><br />Director Sacha Gervasi, best known for his critically acclaimed documentary \\"Anvil! The Story of Anvil,\\" did a decent job in making a semi-bio pic of one of the most famous cultural icons of the last century, but perhaps you shouldn't expect something insightful.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I SAW JT PERFORM AT THE 2013 GRAMMYS AND IT WAS AWSOME!!  HAD TO ADD TO MY JT COLLECTION!! HIS TIME OUT OF THE STUDIO WAS WORTH THE WAIT!!
B00BF123WG|5.0|I haven't felt that much anxiety through a film for a very long time.  Well executed and it doesn't really feel like a movie.  The raid is done to make you feel like you were watching it live on TV.  It was was tense, dark, and chaotic.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film!  It's one of the fastest 2 and a half hour movies I've seen.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Much more interactive than other similar games I have  played. No building restrictions, rewards for making friends/allies, a not-complicated but also not entirely dull plotline. Very fun!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|a lot of fun to play and really great graphics! this will eat up a lot of my spare time for sure!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|The number one game I play it's soooooooooooooo much fun I love it and you will to so get it
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Well-researched and balanced; as other reviewers have commented, unfairly attacked.  I am trying to imagine a man being attacked for giving advice because he is too successful to be relevant. It boggles my mind.<br /><br /> I appreciated Sandberg's honesty. She has many choices other women have not, but that doesn't mean she has not also faced the difficult choices other women face. She expresses compassion for the many different ways that women experience life-work balance, but is providing encouragement for those of us who do want to have a career and a family life. My favorite statistic: women in the 50's and 60's who did not work outside the home spent as many hours in direct child care as women today do who work outside the home. We are setting the standards too high for ourselves!<br /><br />For those looking to ramp up their careers once the children are out of the nest, the book may have a bit too much on earlier life stages.  This is academic for those of us who already made those choices, but still the conversation is worth having.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|A sense of humor mixed in with some great shots of birds. We watched it with my sister and brother-in-law (who are avid birdwatchers). We enjoyed it and laughed a lot. Also I stayed awake (that's a 5 star rating on it's own).
B008ELUEQC|5.0|All of Rod Stewarts music is wonderful. I can listen to his music all day. I would recommend his music to family and friends.
B009GEFXLC|1.0|blurry pic<br />kept stopping<br />May have been my signal but netflix plays better and did not have to pay for individual episodes of castle
1933492953|5.0|This book helped me develop insights that no other book could. It helped me formulate the proper questions to then find the sought out answers. The illustrations are flawless, plus the theory is precise. Simply awesome.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|great product for someone interested in recording music *usb mic*, imputing pictures or any other kind file on sd cards
1936719010|5.0|If you are taking up or in the middle of a creative project, one that is important to you and deserves to be completed - any book by Steven Pressfield is for you. This one gets on your tail every day, forces you to pay attention to the work and pushes you further. I highly recommend it. And him.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|love the game and that its an easy time killer wish there were more pets that you didnt have to buy gems for though
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave was enjoyable for kids and adults alike.  It has a great message and is entertaining at the same time.  As long as you can tolerate their accents, you'll enjoy it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids love this movie.. They watch it over and over again, I highly recommend this if you want to keep them settled down for a while.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very engaging. The characters were well thought out and the plot kept you turning the pages. Highly recommended.The end will surprise you!
B0067R0APK|5.0|great app with all the features you want in an easy to use formats.  no distractions and layers of information to delve through.  great job guys.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I only got this as a free book and sample to see some stuff for the unabridged version but it was nice to have this free option before I bought it.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use it all the time. We are prime members so I always think I can get things cheaper on A-Z, the app lets me scan the item and price-check as well as examine reviews. I know right away (if item is found) if I should buy now or wait. Scanning UPC works great.
B001458MI2|4.0|Since hearing the Burlesque Soundtrack, I've come back to being a current fan. One of the great female voices of our time I truly believe.
1558908323|5.0|Love this movie its a regular when I do a movie line up with friends involving bugs. A must see and the history of NY's underground city. Love it.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I thought this would be a great movie, but what a disapointment.  Just not enough suspense and scariness to the whole movie.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Have the game and movies Just can't go wrong with Bruce. The fight scenes are not pulled all his movies they are real punches. Wow! Awesome. My total hero.
B009JZOOKO|5.0|Very good movie, I would recommend this.  Very interesting how it turns out.  Get some popcorn and enjoy in your recliner.
1558908846|5.0|Super hero scifi at its best. You won't be disapointed in ole Sly as the Judge. Funny Funny!<br />A must see!!!
B0090EIILU|1.0|Not a good movie, don't waste your money.  There are many other movies out there worthy of watching on your TV.
B004P8A7J2|4.0|This film is worth watching more than once. Unfortunately an important piece has been cut from the currently available version. It was pretty gruesome but it fit well within the overall story.
159514188X|5.0|This book had me hooked right from the beginning. I've read a few books about teen suicide, but this storyline was so different. Reading the thoughts of the girl who committed suicide, in her own words, was what sets this book apart.<br /><br />Hannah gives all the reasons why she decides to commit suicide, and even though some of them seem a little small to me, to a teen living through it, it could be a big deal. Our words and deeds can have such a huge impact on others,  we all need to be careful what we say and do. And of course, lots of small things can become one big thing. Plus, we all know that everything doesn't affect each of us the same.<br /><br />I loved this book and would recommend it to everyone, no matter their age, and think this book should be required reading for schools.<br /><br />The power of the tongue is life and death<br />Proverbs 18:21
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Cute fun fresh take on rom com! I've seen it 6 times now and it's just so easy to watch!!! Voices aren't killer but very realistic!!!!
0887306667|5.0|Its simple, has short paragraphs and gets to the point. Much of the evidence for these &#34;Laws&#34; are anecdotal, so the great business person will learn that sometimes these laws should be broken, but for the most part, what is said in this book is true.
B000FA675C|4.0|So I FINALLY read this book. This is a story of the search of the holy grail. Like any other book/movie regarding this search, it grabs some truth and some fiction and weaves them together to make for a believable read. I've read better, but this was good.<br /><br />And only because I know it's caused a stir, I'll add that I didn't once feel as though it was attacking anything I believe in. Every book I read opens my mind to one thing or another, so I wouldn't say this one did so more than any other. Please... do not read if you think you're going to learn something new about a faith or religion or even some secret society that was hidden and guarded closely until Dan Brown stumbled over it and let the whole world know... It's just a sci-fi book! Instead, try googling and pay attention to the website you're going to. Look for reviews of the site even. Some people feed their &#34;open&#34; mind with delusions and then can't see through the muddle. So try opening your heart as well. :)
B00BF11UM0|3.0|It's interesting alright, but mostly very boring, lots of extra dialogue and drama, and then maybe 15-20 minutes of action at the end, truly unriveting, a mediocre film at best. Nat Geo could probably make a better one hour program.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful show, all of the characters draw you in and keep you interested in the show, I am very obsessed
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|even better than the movie, and not quite as unnecessarily vulgar..this is truly one of the best story lines in a comic book.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Lincoln is one of my favorite presidents. I live in VA where so much of the civil war took place. I loved the acting in this movie. Never before has anyone played Lincoln where you truly felt like you were watching Lincoln and alive during this time period. I loved the historic moments of politics and the hardships of this time in history. I would have loved to have seen more of the actual civil war take place....great movie. A must watch!<br /><br />Cindy Hively
B007V9N5R8|5.0|I was editing my photos with out a calibrated screen and always had to guess how light or dark the print would turn out, it usually came out too dark so I would just brighten the image more than I really wanted it and hope it would turn out right. After receiving the x-rite colormunki display and colorchecker passport all the guess work is gone, after the first calibration you see the difference right away and your prints come out just the way they look on screen. I bought the used bundle and everything looks to be in mint condition shipping was fast and everything works great. Here is a tip if you are sending your prints out to a third party to be printed make sure you know what kind of photoshop settings they recommend you use ie. SRGB or RGB, CMYK things like that will effect the color of your print.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Several of the pople in our office read this book and then we had a lunch discussion. Very helpful tips. We all found this an easy read with a lot of information to ponder. I would highly reccomend this book.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I found out that India is the daughter of a great former Michigan State basketball player, who I enjoyed watching play many times. So I thought I would support his daughter by buying her CD.I'm glad I did! Great, soulful music! I have really enjoyed it!
B0034DGPEU|3.0|How a family of black slaves takes a young indentured white girl into their bosom with warmth, caring, and love.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|I admit, due to seeing Twilight and thinking the movie terribly overrated, I did not see this movie because I thought it was going to do the same thing.  I was wrong and I regret it.  This movie was entertaining, very well directed, and visually stunning. The actors were also enjoyable to watch.  I now learned the hard lesson of not judging something based on the image of something that came before it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I hadn't read a Grisham book for a long time.  I had forgotten what a great storyteller he is.  I needed a book for vacation and this was perfect. It is a quick read with good characters.  I will revisit some of his other books now.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Great movie for families. May be a little too violent and scary for younger kids depending on their viewing habits. My husband and I saw this in theaters when we were dating and we enjoyed it as much this time as we did back then.
B004EF65QA|5.0|Such a quality program - the acting was superb. The casting person is to be commended - each actor filled their character with believability.<br />Though I have not read Gaskell's novel, it is certainly on my book list now. The story was engrossing and realistic. It was such a good study of the times and the working conditions prevalent in the northern factories.<br />I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys period pieces, good acting, and human relaionships.<br />Way to go, BBC!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Always on the edge of new sounds and ideas. One of his best projects. I hope there are more new songs to come in the near future.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Peter Jackson has done it again. Whether you have read The Hobbit or not, this is an adventure you do not want to miss. Love the dwarfs - and even though they make a horrid mess of Bilbo's house, they do leave it back in immaculate order once they exit. Martin Freeman is a delight - such facial expressions! Richard Armitage is a strong, intense Thorin - who knew he could sing? And Gandalf is at it again, leading a delightful crew of adventuresome characters!<br />The Blue ray looks great on the HD television, and the extras show off the gorgeous countryside of New Zealand as well as the mischievous nature of the film's director! Makes one wish for a faster release of the next installment!
160459201X|5.0|this book summed up the many books i have read in the past, touching on this very concept of positive thinking
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie recieved a 4 star because I expected a little more out of the move.  The movie sometime became some what boring at times.  However, I would buy another Hobbit movie to add to all my Lord of the Rings and have the first Hobbit movie.  I can not wait to see the next one and hope it has even more details and action in it.  Would I recommend it to others yes, because it does start from the beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I would definitely recommend you getting this app because it has survival and creative u can create your own world and it saves it also you can go on to other people's world as long as your close to them
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Nothing can bring years to the eyes like a good musical score and nothing can bring joy to the heart than seeing it on your own TV.
B000FA675C|5.0|I got the Kindle version because it was free (at the time) to add to my Kindle. I'd already bought the hardback version pictured here and read it.  Before the movie came out, I bought an illustrated version of it and read it, as well.  Of all the novels Brown has written, this one is 3rd with &#34;Angeles and Demons&#34;, just edging it out for 2nd.  What's my favorite? &#34; Digital Fortress&#34;.  As someone familiar with a lot of the computer terminology,  I found it enjoyable and easy to follow.  All along as I read it, I pictured Jody Foster in the title female role.  I did not picture Tom Hanks in this (or the other films). I hope a Kindle version is offered for free.  I want to add it to my Kindle and read it again.
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Gerard Butler is such an awesome actor and seeing him makes me want to go to the beach! This was a sad but inspiring story!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|This episode of &#34;Castle&#34; was right out of the movie &#34;Rear Window&#34;.  It was an ingenious story line with a surprise ending I won't give away.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|I ready all of the Sherlock Holmes books as a kid, and after the new movies came out, I wanted to reread them.  Still awesome.
B005LAII1C|5.0|This is movie was very funny to me. I originally didn't have any interest in the movie until I actually watched it. It was really funny and over the top
B00008OE4W|5.0|The disk was new and the packaging was intact.  This is a great classic movie and has a great cast.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Good movie. The plot of this movie is crazy, but very interesting. I was interested in the movie throughout it's course
B0015DROBO|5.0|It was a little on the dark side but well written and a good read.  I read it in 3 sittings.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|if you are a slow walking, slow talking and a &#34;what ever&#34; type of person don't bother. This is a movie for people who don't  like to sit still. Somethings were kind of corny but so what. I loved it. Action, action,action and more action, it's the way to go.
0143034901|5.0|Was very impressed with this book and is now one of my favorites.  I got this copy for a friend.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch is smaller than I expected, despite all the review saying so.  However, my favorite size is around 38mm, so this is close!  This is an understated watch, not flashy or showy.  It's a watch that does what it is designed to do, and does it well.<br /><br />I've had it on my wrist for two weeks now and it hasn't gained or lost a second.  I'm not joking.  I set it the day after i received it and managed to get it pretty much spot on (second hand is 8 seconds fast) and it hasn't changed at all in two weeks.  I was surprised and perhaps I was lucky enough to get a great copy.<br /><br />I don't have much experience, but the lume on this is outstanding.  It's easy to read in the middle of the night when I get up to use the bathroom.  My wife even noticed in the middle of the night and asked me the next morning if my watch was glowing!<br /><br />This is my first automatic and I can't complain.  If you have smaller wrists or like a more classic proportion for your watch this is a nice way to go for a low cost.<br /><br />I have no complaints, at all.  That is rare.  I'm a pretty picky guy!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great plot, actors were involve in their own personal paradigma.  The joker made Batman to look interesting, and enigmatic. in general excellent movie.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This has got to be one of the best classics I've read (that's saying a lot...love the classics), I was given a copy for Christmas one year, as soon as the festivities were over I sat down cracked it open and didn't stop reading except to sleep.<br />Very rarely do I insist to someone that they just HAVE to read such and such book, if ever there were a book that I would it would be Dracula.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great read for anybody who has a mind opened to a world that we have not yet seen as a whole. God is real, loving and present.
B006AX6ONI|3.0|This is a great book. I only gave it 3 stars due to the basic, blog structure of it. I'm a huge Mark Cuban fan, and enjoyed reading about his rise to the top. What a down to earth, everyday guy.
0451418441|5.0|As a sequel to Pillars of the Earth, how could World Without End possibly compare? Well, I love it, for its excitement and the information we are given about life in the Middle Ages. The weaving together of the various parts of the plot is so skillful. I have really enjoyed Ken Follett's books. And the company's service was very prompt. I'm a satisfied customer!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very well written.  Kept my attention and could not wait to read each chapter.  Wonderful story that kept you reading.
B000C13Y2S|2.0|this lasted close to 3 months bright little light plastic holding chain broke after a month but still 5 dollars not bad
B00B84652O|5.0|Great package of a Great artist!<br />King Diamond in his best form. Classic albuns. Nice price for quality of the product.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Really sophomoric. Most jokes were marginally funny. The voices are just straight out of family guy. Dont waste your time.
B008B68IEA|3.0|The bed is real pretty but the decorative ice branches around the headboard fall off easily and end up elsewhere in my daughters room. The other pieces stick together well.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|The movies are great on their own, but the dinosaur figure is awesome. Highly recommend to any fans who plan on buying the movies on blu-ray.
B0055PMURG|4.0|I think it was an inspiring movie and a pretty good family film that I think is good for all ages!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is nice to have a basic calculator to use whenever the need arises.  Helps you make quicker and better decisions when shopping or whatever.
B00BESM14U|5.0|It was deeply heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time!!!! All three young actors were amazing and so deep! Emma Watson definently shined!!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Easily the best movie of the year, only shown in a few theatres- you really Must see this movie! Just amazing
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoy playing, relaxing fun for me.  This game is great on the Kindle fire and love that I can take it anywhere.
B00B23O96A|3.0|2 really good songs and the rest were lame- not typical of Clapton-The live concert , however, was spectacular in Houston
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful entertainment, great acting, story captivating, what's not to like.  History well represented.  Actors seemed well selected for there roles.
B00005JK8K|5.0|Not only is it a action packed war movie, it is also a good history lesson and opens your mind to a culture that is near extinction.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|The movie series goes up and down.<br />When it comes to ideas and the action that it builds.<br />But overall... the movie was still pleasing when it comes to the action.<br />But when comes to the enemies, still needs more to it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is very well written. It has a definite point of view. It is well acted and suspenseful. It is a good story. However, I sometimes have difficulty following the dialogue due to the English accent and the speed of their speech. I'd recommend it to anyone but especially to anyone interested in England and English history.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|I love to listen to Alicia Keys.<br />She always does her best to perform these songs.<br />Every album, she puts out, she kinds of do better than the last.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great read with a lot of twists and turns!! Hard time putting the book down. Had me on the edge of every page.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|But I didn't read well, I though I was buying the bluray discs. anyway, all the DVDs and extras are very good!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Simply the best game of all the temple run games. I have to make myself stop<br />Playing. I only wish it was compatible<br />For my Kindle fire. I can only play this<br />Game on my Samsung galaxy 3.<br />Please make a version for my Kindle<br />Please!!!!!!!!!
B00BI745AA|5.0|I saw the play years ago.  The movie was amazing! The music and acting was captivating.  I recommend it with five stars,
B00C7D3TRO|3.0|For an album titled &#34;Save Rock & Roll&#34;, this album certainly does not. There is definitely more pop than rock.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is creative and fun for ages nine to twelve. It can be a little boring to wait for the game to load. All in all, this is a great game.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD is simply amazing!  But I guess y'all already knew that since it took me forever to rate it.
0316223239|5.0|Told from the point of view of an exceptional five-year-old boy, this book is a thriller because of what it doesn't say.  For example, everything Outside is TV.  It isn't real.  Old Nick only comes at night, when Jack is required to stay in Wardrobe.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for the reader to figure out that Ma has been held captive for a number of long years.  Jack was born in Room.  He doesn't understand that this is a place of horror for his mother, because she tries so hard to make Room the best place in the world for her son.<br /><br />But there are obvious problems with living in Room.  What if something were to happen to Old Nick?  This place is a locked and sealed environment.  All their food, clothing, and any other item they might need is supplied by Old Nick.  There is no way out of Room.<br /><br />Jack doesn't care about that.  He has no reason to care.  His mother has done a terrific job in making his life as normal as possible.<br />However, the only solution is to find a way out, and that is impossible.<br /><br />Or is it?<br /><br />You will need to read the book to see if they are ever to escape Room and Old Nick.  The chances are greater than they cannot.  This book redefines \\"thriller.\\"  It is one of the best thrillers on the market.  It deserves a full five stars.
0988936402|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book. What a creative story! I really loved the character development! Carywn and Dagda the marmook, which now I want a marmook. \\"Marmoks were friendly and inspiring animals\\", \\"Carywn found solace in the fact that Dagda represented the goodness and hope of Everville\\"! What a wonderful creature!<br /><br /> I enjoyed the Echo club games and battles and how the author Roy Huff, used them in Owen Sage's journey. The most wonderful descriptions of every thing from the paintings,the Keepers workshop, all the creatures Owen encountered, and the scenery, it all made you feel as if you were there. Excellent job!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to Roy's next book, as I was rather disappointed to have it end. It left you wanting more!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book.<br /><br />Cathy Connolly<br />Author of \\"If I Should Die Before My Dog\\"
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Watching the movie again. After so many years made  me want to be a kid again. It also brought back fond memories of my girls watching this very same story and an even greater treat seeing the wonder in my granddaughters eyes as she watched snow white as well.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is a great great game. The rewards are plentiful enough that you don't have to wait for long periods to get more cards and items. Very addicting I can't put it down. If you like trading card games this is a must have
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Author is on his high horse and tries to justify his comatose voyage to heaven by constantly using his credentials as a neurosurgeon, just not believable.
B009R659L8|5.0|I<br /><br />Enjoyed this book very much  It was Hard to put down.<br /><br />The ending was a surprise.<br />Looking forward to Mary's next book
0770433782|5.0|So perfect. As a wedding photographer, I swoon over the gorgeous photography....and as a graphic designer, I appreciate the simple design and the creamy paper. Overall, it may just be the best wedding book out there.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|We don't always agree on what books we like, but everyone in our group liked this book.  It is a story about an Everyman, Harold Fry, who has been a failure in many aspects of his life.  His career floundered and failed; his only son became addicted, estranged and died; and now he and his wife live together in their home as intimate strangers.  Fry begins his long walk to find an old friend Queenie, needing to find some way to atone for his failed past and to undertake a genuine pilgrimage to find something in life that still has meaning and importance to him.<br />We all liked the way the plot slowly unveiled his past, enabling us to understand Harold's life and sufferings.  There is also humor in the book, especially surrounding the crowd of followers who take up with Harold and his cause.
1401216676|5.0|The darkest book I've ever read. The Joker has outdone himself. The final scene with the Batman and Joker laughing together is erily insightful.
B0051BNRTO|2.0|I love Nick Hornby, but \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is by far his weakest novel. The plot was so inconceivable that it made the entire story silly. None of the characters were remotely likeable. The story read like it was made of lead, plodding and painful. The book was lacking Hornby's signature wit. It had a few interesting things to say about fame and obsession, but it failed to hold my interest. I really hope that he gets back on track for his next novel!<br /><br />Please visit my blog for more reviews and bookish things.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it it is really appropriate for all ages.I think you need to have skill because I haven't gotten that far...yet!anyway I think that this is a five star product!:)
0316223239|4.0|** spoiler alert ** I picked up Emma Donoghue's \\"Room\\" after reading very mixed reviews. The first hundred pages started slow and I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish the book, then it picked up steam and didn't slow down.<br />The story is told from the perspective of five year old Jack, who lives with his mother in a shed, where they are being held captive. The shed is the only world that Jack has ever known and his mother creates a life for them in their eleven-by-eleven foot space. Donoghue does a very convincing job of telling the story from the perspective of a child and she really creates his world. The story only had a few moments where I felt like something was said out of character, but I mostly bought right into it.<br />I think what I connected to the most was the theme of individuality. Once Jack and his mother reenter the world, they are attacked by people who do not understand them, but try to tell them how they must feel or how they should behave. The psychologists in the story are well intending, but clearly have no clue how to help them and are intrusive. They may have been through an ordeal, but they do not want, nor do they need the input from the psychologist, who cannot identify their needs. To me, this was a very central theme, as we live in a society that seems to want to slap labels on problems and fix them. This carries over into other segments of society for Jack and his mom...the women at the book club, the news reporters, ect.. everyone pities them and thinks that they must need help, but people do not actually bother to listen to what they want or respect their wishes. This aspect of the book made me feel sick to my stomach, but it rang true.<br />Although the book got off to a slow start, I felt like many aspects of it were brilliantly done.<br /><br />Please visit my blog for more reviews and musings.
1600247245|5.0|I sooooo enjoy Michael Connelly's work.  His books encompass humor, thrills, simply everything I look for in a book and The Black Box did it all.  Recommended it to my friends (they always ask what I am reading).
B000069HKH|5.0|I'm writing this review in 2013, about 4 years after first buying the cd, and 12 years after it first came out.  As you might gather from that span of time, I'm not a huge Springsteen fan.  But this cd is an amazing work, probably the best The Boss has ever put out.  Shortly after I bought the cd, and while still under its' spell, I put together my own cd version of the Best of Springsteen. It featured 8 songs from this cd: Empty Sky, Worlds Apart, The Rising, Lonesome Sky, Further on, the Fuse, Paradise, and Mary's Place.  That's 8 out of 17 cuts I fit into an 80 minute \\"best of\\" cd.  Surely this was a function of a brief musical infatuation. I recently replayed (and re-played and replayed...) this best of cd, and it was no infatuation, it was true love.  If I could only take 25 songs with me to a deserted island, I'd include \\"Empty Sky\\" and \\"Worlds Apart,\\" except that I would fear my hearing because I want to crank them both to maximim volume. \\"Paradise\\" would be in the mix if I was allowed 50.  The only problem with the cd is that most of the best songs are cuts 6 and after.<br /><br />A serious work that manages to engage at an intellectual level while achieving a gut-level connection to my rock-n-roll soul. Wow!!!
B00BLGZDYA|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />I suspect that viewers will either love or hate \\"Holy Motors,\\" a surreal French drama that eventually falls victim to its own pretentiousness.<br /><br />It tells the tale of an actor/quick-change artist who rides around Paris in a specially designed stretch-limo, donning various costumes and enacting bizarre movie-type scenes for paying customers. One moment he's a sewer-dwelling beast in search of a \\"beauty;\\" the next he's a hit man , then a female beggar, then a dying old man, even, at one point, a CGI effect come to life.<br /><br />Written and directed by Leos Carax, the movie ultimately emerges as a cinematic Rorschach Test, open to whichever interpretation each member of the audience cares to get out of it. Is it about how we all eventually wind up donning masks and false identities as a means of escaping the crushing monotony of our daily lives? Or is it about how we use such masks to avoid showing ourselves and the world-at-large who we really are? Or is it a dissertation on the nature of art and the artist, or on the changing nature of movie making in an era in which the camera has become a ubiquitous part of everyday life, available to anyone and everyone at all times?<br /><br />Who knows, and, frankly, who really cares? In terms of execution, Carax lacks the light hand and delicate touch of a Luis Bunuel from his late French period. \\"Holy Motors,\\" on the other hand, is redundant and, at times, downright unpleasant, and much too impressed with its own cleverness to be of much interest to any but the most esoteric-minded of viewers. But the Paris locales are nice.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|I got this for my nephew who is in grade school.  He barely sits down and instead runs around, so I figured this would be a good present for him.  He enjoyed playing with it until he had to reload and then he got kind of bored with it.  Plus, it doesn't come with all the clips it can hold.  That's kind of cheezy on the company's part.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Liza at her prime. Joel Grey amazing. Everyone should see it, even if you are not a fan of musicals.
B006LSZECO|4.0|About half way through the book and the ending disappointed me!  A good read though - but in the end - good did not prevail over evil!  That is all I am going to say because if I say more, I will give the of away!
B004VYYA2K|4.0|The concept is interesting and once it's unzipped it's great, but it's almost impossible for kids to zip these up themselves (unzipping is easy).
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Could do with fewer ads. Is it really necessary after each game? The game itself is fast paced with plenty to challenge you. Flashy and fun!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|nice quality and good movie.  Would recommend this for everyone to see at least once and relive the true events that occurred in history.
1455526959|5.0|It seems like so many formerly good authors (see, for example, Demille, Nelson and White, Randy Wayne) ran out of steam as their novels reached the double-digit count.  I no longer read either author.  But it's refreshing to see that Michael Connelly is still going strong after twenty years.  The Black Box is a very good, very clever mystery.  It was realistic, plausible, and seemed like a story that could've happened in the real world.  Recommended for anyone who enjoys an intelligent mystery.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I have read a few of the negative reviews of this book and I think that some people do not understand Irish Culture.  In American society, one would call it meloncoly, even depression.  Irish authors use their words to take one  up and down the emotional ladder and leave it there.  They expect you to move on, \\"take no notice, so to speak\\".  The facts are cruel, life is cruel, but it isn't THE purpose of the book.  Look how carefully Ms. McKenna moves Jamie's life along.  Surely nothing could be funnier than that bathroom scene.  The ending is not and I mean not, depressing by any means.  He gets everything he ever longed for.  It was a very entertaining and worthwhile book.  Try not to fall into the emotional pit; it's always depressing there.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game freezes up constantly.  I play on my Kindle Fire, maybe that is the problem.  I notice other people complain about it also.  There is a chat room where people can be very disgusting.  To complete a level you must win all of the statues in that level.  I find that there are always a couple that are impossible to win.  You have to trade to get them, but there are no instructions on how you do this.  I do find this game a challenge which is why I gave it three stars.
B001AKTZPA|5.0|LOVE Creedance and John Fogerty. I STILL have and play every 45 single and LP. I always liked Green River LP. Great songs such as Green River, Bad Moon Rising, Lodi, Toumbstone Shadow, Wrote a Song For Everyone, Cross Tie Walker. I just like the conviniance of playing the CD (like I did 45's and Albums) while going to sleep. Played it last night in fact. Never get tired of CCR or John Fogerty.  (Also, a great little picture book comes as a bonus with the CD). The 1st time I heard &#34;Bad Moon Rising&#34; it blew me away. And then followed by &#34;Green River&#34;!!!  Also, I love the song Lodi!!!!  Have a bootleg LP of CCR playing at the closing of The Filmore West.  John Fogerty says &#34;this is for all the places bands are have to go back to now that the Filmore is a closing&#34; Then they play &#34;Lodi&#34;  Love it!!!!    The one song the John says he woud go back and change is &#34;Wrote A Song For Eveyone&#34;, but it is a GREAT song the way he wrote it in 1969.  CCR got me through Vietnam in 1970-71 With &#34;Bayou Country&#34;, &#34;Green River&#34;, &#34;Willie and the Poor Boys&#34; and &#34;Cosmos Factory&#34;!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love mobile app of  blitz play on facebook now I don't have to be on Pc to play have played for years now only problem is hitting bingo when trying to daub number
B00BWJARHO|1.0|The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey, brings almost nothing new to the Lord of The Rings franchise.  In fact, much of the movie feels recycled from the earlier trilogy using the same dramatic devices.  It neither satisfies as an adult adventure with its excessively long dining, fighting and chase scenes nor is it suitable as a children's' tale with its graphic animated violence.  The only fresh adventure aspect is the introduction of mountain monsters who are engaged in an unexplained combat.  The one redeeming scene in the movie is the exquisitely acted interchange between the elf princess Lorien (Kate Blanchett) and Gandalf (Ian McKellen).  Overall, a big disappointment that tarnishes the earlier brilliant work of Peter Jackson.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is slow pace but interesting only problem when you explore rooms you should get more of the equipment needed to banish off the bad stuff it would make the game more fun I think
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I loved this quirky fun addictive game!!! Easygoing yet still a challenge. The perfect distraction when trying to de-stress after a long day.

B006QS0PF0|5.0|It takes an incredible amount of balls to be as open and honest not only to yourself, but to the whole world, in shedding light on your deepest darkest demons.<br />A true brave Occa chick!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Where do I even start? This movie literally blew me away! I loved it. Without a doubt it's my favorite movie of all time. The entire cast was excellent. Jamie Foxx was perfect for this role. I heard Will Smith turned it down, and although I love Will Smith too, I think Foxx was meant to play this role. Django Unchained fits in nicely with Tarantino's other films. But for some reason this one stands apart.<br /><br />For one, it is not as violent as some of his other movies. It's just the right amount -- not even close to Kill Bill. But there's something very unique about Django. Yes, it's about a slave and he is the hero of the story. But there's something else too. It's how the story was told.<br /><br />Most people don't \\"get it\\" or maybe it's just not their thing. However, let's sit down and really think about this. Slavery was a very foreboding period of American history. How could we be based on freedom and equality, while at the same time subjecting people to unspeakable evils? Such a contradiction in morality would not go unchallenged forever. This movie shows just how far we've come in a relatively short period of time.<br /><br />I grew up in south Georgia. I was exposed to racism. I knew it existed. I knew racist people. And yet, I had no clue just how much progress occurred before I was born. What I experienced was nothing compared to the old days.<br /><br />This really got me interested in the history of slavery in America. I wanted to know what parts of Django were based on history and what parts were embellished -- which I subsequently did purchasing several books on the subject. It's amazing what a simple romanticized story can inspire.<br /><br />Django Unchained is filled with vivid colorful characters like the amazing Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, who if I am not mistaking won an Academy award for his performance.<br /><br />The entire film is stimulating. You'll love to love the heroes and you'll love to hate the villains. Good deservesto triumph and evil only warrants justice. Give Django a chance. You'll love it, and even if you don't maybe it'll inspire you to examine our history and see just how far we've come as a species. Let's keep moving forward and stop dividing ourselves up into imaginary groups just to appease our egos.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />A white guy
B005IQZB14|5.0|What an incredible journey. This has become one of my favorite books and I can't wait to read it again.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read this book before I saw the movie.  The book is awesome...I couldn't put it down.  I highly recommend it!!
B004GUSG4M|1.0|This story could have been written in 20 pages. It was incredibly boring. It helped me fall asleep at night.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|You gotta have it if you have this headset or plan on buying it.<br /><br />PROS<br />Its nice knowing that that you have an additional amount of battery charging available to you even if you dont have access to a outlet or car charger.<br /><br />the case is great little holder when in the vehicle or at your desk. keeps the little lint pieces, dust and fuzzes off the device that you might find in your desk draw or center console.<br /><br />CONS:  none yet
B002PLALCO|5.0|i love this dvd, it is fun to watch and the quality is really clear. it makes you want to get up and dance.
0307120007|1.0|I bought this book for my son after seeing it was so popular. But when I opened the package, I was blown away by the strong smell of PERFUME! The &#34;Smell the flowers&#34; page smells SOOO strong. Fragrances are SO unhealthy, toxic in fact. I am very strict about not having artificial fragrances in my home and especially around my child. They are endocrine disruptors as well as damaging to the immune system... not what I want my little boy exposed to.<br />If it was a natural fragrance such as lavender essential oil or peppermint.. something like that would be fine. I think putting scents in a sensory book is a great idea, but it has to be natural fragrance, not toxic chemical fragrance.<br /><br />The fragrance alone was enough for me to send it back, but the quality is not what you'd expect. The plastic binding seems very cheap and fragile, and the pages are thick paper/thin cardboard. My son is only 6 months and I know the recommendation is 1-3 years, but my nephew is 2 years old, and this book wouldn't last long with him. WAY to flimsy. I would expect a texture book to be more sturdy because texture books seem to be more for babies under one year; older children are not as interested in texture books. My 6 month old LOVES textures right now. My 2 year old nephew on the other hand is more interested in stories and pictures. He doesn't really care about the textures much anymore.<br /><br />Overall, this book was cute, but a huge miss in the key areas - quality/sturdiness - and come on you guys.... fragrance? This is just a terrible thing to put in a children's book! Get rid of the fragrance PLEASE!<br /><br />One note about amazon: I requested a refund minutes after opening my package, and amazon refunded my money no questions asked, and even let me keep the book (not that I will actually keep it) I'm assuming because I'm such a valued customer ;) jk. THANK YOU amazon for being SO awesome! This is why I purchase from amazon! Because they offer outstanding customer service.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Beautifully done with a great story and the backgrounds are superb.  I love to watch it again and again.  Great!
B0045XICB2|5.0|Great Product and good movie. I recommend this to any person who likes Sci-Fi . Well directed and good acting.<br /><br />No cons
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I very much enjoyed this series. I watched all of the episodes on my ipad and found the quality superb and a pleasure to sit and enjoy. I've already ordered season three.  Have to catch up with the rest of the world.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|I love this CD!!!! Almost every song on the CD is my favorite. I highly recommend this CD to everyone!
1416914285|3.0|It could be me, but it is taking a bit to get into it. It is an interesting premise though.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I could not put it down.  Magical realism that one can accept and enjoy.  Be sure you have time to keep reading when you start it.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I purchased 2 AWUS036NHR units installed under WIN7.  The frist one bricked within 5 minutes.  Alfa support just told me to return unit and that this was more than likely a fluke.  Returned item, waited several days and ordered another of same.  Again, unit bricked within 5 minutes.  Signal strenth fell from 100% to less than 10%.  Had to be within 20 ft of router to get any type signal.  Removing antenna did not change a thing suggesting that signal was only reaching internal component?  Contacted Alfa support by e-mail (Taiwan) for help.  Sent several screen prints of utility software to veryify that unit was not functioning.  Support directed me to an upload site for \\"improved\\" power driver.  Installed driver with no change in unit.  Soon as I questioned whether the problem may be a hardware issue, communication from Alfa support ended.<br />Obvious that Alfa introduced these units to the market without adequate QC and testing.  I would not recommend buying the AWUS036NHR until Alfa can demonstrate these units will work.  Poor company that uses the public as their testing source.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|& this one is so full of action & horror characters  that youre sure going for a good time. almost no gore, very pleasant to watch
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|I couldn't like or hate this game. Pretty much a bridge building game that involves a touch of logic to complete all awards within each level. There is a tutorial level island, although it really only tells you what the materials are and can be used for, such as steel is stronger than wood but more expensive. There really is no \\"tutorial\\" for what the tools (except materials)/buttons mean, although it takes only a moment to understand them (the left side buttons are used for saving bridges, opening saved ones, delete the bridge, etc / the right side is the materials plus the list of awards and what you have to do to win them).<br /><br />Now, I was a bit confused with the sound button on the main menu. It only stops the music, there is no button to stop the sounds. The confusing part is that the music is only a faint backdrop to the game, where the sounds (like car honks) are the loudest thing heard; so I'm not sure why the developers only allow for music mute.<br /><br />The game plays ok on my kindle fire. At first, I had some issue getting the bridge parts to go in a straight/diagonal line (it would stop a bit off of where I wanted it to end). But, after a while, I got the hang of how to do it. So, beyond that, the game plays well on my kindle.<br /><br />Overall, the graphics are ok in a simple, cute-ish design, but nothing overly grand and worthwhile. I like the zoom in and out feature, as being able to zoom in and move the image allows for easier placement of bridge parts. I think I could only recommend this to anyone who liked the first bridge game (haven't played it and not sure how it compares though).<br /><br />As a side note, the \\"tutorial\\" says you don't have to complete all the awards (five in each level), but you need a minimum amount to unlock each island.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle would not charge with the cable that had come with my Kindle. I called your service dept, and was so pleased with the help I received. The representative was knowledgable and very helpful in getting me back to using my Kindle. This cable has worked great. Thanks again.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|I only gave this app 3 stars because I actually liked the photo editing. There was quite a bit of options, even a \\"meme\\" one. In fact, the majority of the options are solely for photo editing.<br /><br />As for the \\"drawing\\" aspect, there are a ton of different, much better drawing apps--even the ones that are free, like sketchbook or isketch. This app, regardless of the name, only gives you the option of a handful of colors and pen sizes. There is an eraser tool as well, but there is no backspace/undo or even redo option. The only way to get rid of unwanted marks are through eraser or you can hit the back arrow to start a whole new page.<br /><br />Overall, this may be a great app for younger kids or anyone who mainly does photo editing. As for someone who is serious about drawing and looking for a good app, dodge this as it's not worth the money, no matter how cheap. I will still use this app for photo editing and tweaking but I'll keep an eye out for real drawing apps.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|mine wouldn't let me buy it and I'm pretty sure I wasted a dollar wanted to play but guess not
B0067EKY9K|5.0|Loved the movie.  Blue-Ray is great. I would like to see more films of this quality come to DVD on a regular basis.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept me reading to see what would happen next. Would have liked a &#34;different&#34;, more satisfying ending.<br />May recommend to friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've become an avid book reader and have read hundreds of books over the last couple of years. That being said, this book had a PROFOUND IMPACT and left me breathless.<br /><br />I laughed, I grieved, I cried in sadness and in joy and I FELT all the emotions of the main characters. This book has remained in my heart and soul and I will never forget this truly amazing story.<br /><br />This is not a Young Adult book despite the characters being in their late teens (and in high school). This book will affect you on a profound level and discusses deep issues (including sexual abuse). Despite the difficult topics there is hope and love and it left me with a warm feeling in my heart.<br /><br />I usually do not give books a second thought once I've finished, however, this was a BEAUTIFUL story about the human spirit and how we can survive unimaginable horrors and still get up in the morning and live. The love and support the main characters shared was beautiful and I look forward to reading all of Colleen Hoover's books. Very highly recommended!!
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I enjoyed the book but I think I would have liked it better if I weren't a fan of the show.  I kept picturing Kate Beckett saying the  words in one of the episodes.  I was curious what kind of a writer this Richard Castle actually was.  I'll probably read another.
B009LRE040|5.0|Very great movie and finding finish to the film series of the dark knight. Bane was great and Christian bake even better
142314189X|3.0|My grandson and he said they were okay but he didn't rave about them. Since I didn't read them it is hard to review the product.
B003Y5HWJU|3.0|I wasn't completely in love with the show, but liked it.  I love Steve Buscemi and will continue to watch the show for him.  He is so good shifting characters and this show is a perfect example of his acting abilities.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I can't believe I stayed up 4 night is a row reading this book. I could not put it down.  Never say never...I said once that I would never read fantasy and now I am hooked.  Absolutely one of the best books I have read in a long time. Good way to lose yourself from the cares of this world and join the Game of Thrones.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show...I can't wait until next season.  The character building is right on!  Im off my seat during the whole show and will stay up late because I can't wait to see what happens next.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|It's not my usual reading material.  People are talking about it and I wanted to know what it's all about.  Very interesting.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I felt I was getting a history lesson and being entertained at the same time.  These are the movies they should be having the kids watch in school.  I'm not kidding!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|This is based on a true story and we all hear about the Mavericks but to know the history and this young man's story is quite wonderful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great story with wonderful twist and turns.  You'll find it hard to put down.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Just got it today and started playing, I wasn't sure if ut would connect with my facebook page or not but it did...I'm just glad I don't have to start my collections all over. I took a star off because you cant play it off line

B00B22IJXK|1.0|No easy to use, same functions as other free apps.  Basic functions, in summary not worth the cost of the app
B000002GVO|5.0|Hotel California, the song, is one of Rolling Stone magazine's greatest rock songs of all time, and the album is a classic of the early '70s.  I'm almost ashamed I'd never owned it before.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Police officer Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) and the rest of the living find themselves in an epic battle to survive against a zombie apocalypse. The show is based on the graphic novel series by Robert Kirkman, although the producers and script writer Kirkman himself diverge from the graphic novels on occasions. For the few living, the best strategy is sticking together. Rick's group forms in this first season and immediately the viewer begins to become attached to the characters. The acting is excellent, the gore scenes are executed realistically, and the story is brilliant as we follow these main characters with their problem of survival and their interpersonal problems within the group. I gladly recommend this entertainment!
B0033H7VI6|4.0|Ok, overall impression of this knife is very good.  Great feel, great weight, looks awesome.  For a brand new knife, I think it should be sharper.  The blade has a powder finish coating which is nice in general, but there are imperfections (streaks) in the finish which bother me.  The grip is comfortable, however there were areas whick stuck out over the blade and off the back of the handle.  I could see these areas causing a blister if not shaved off and trimmed to be flush, so I did just that.  Also, for some reason both the least important issue AND the one which bothers me the most:  the knife I got does not say EXTREME SURVIVAL on the blade as in the photos, it just says SCHRADE.  I know it doesn't make a difference in the performance of the knife whatsoever, but that badge appealed to me and I'm disappointed that it was not there.  I deducted only one star for all those issues,  but I was leaning towards deducting two.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I like puzzles and solving issues so I started out breezing through a few levels. Then I realized it was taking concentration and rework to move to the next puzzle. So far enjoying it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A beautifully written book, both heart wrenching and uplifting. Without giving away the ending, I would encourage any reader of this book to keep reading it to the end. I had a little trouble getting interested in the beginning of this book, but I am glad I continued, and so will you!
B0099114WO|5.0|Meryl and Tommy make this movie enjoyable and satisfying!  All married couples probably will go through these scenarios before the end of their lives.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I could not put the book down.  The writer keeps your attention from the moment you start to the moment you fall asleep at night or have to quit writing for some other reason.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This is an outstaning movie which brings morals full circle in reflection with superb acting, very real plot scenario, and a very satisfying conclusion!
B0034G4OYA|2.0|While this film wasn't terrible, it certainly wasn't good.  It almost tried too hard to be funny.  However, resorting to crude humor jokes and bad puns isn't a way to win over viewers.  The basis of the entire film is that lying is okay as long as you accomplish what is needed.  What a message to send to younger viewers!!  As far as being amusing, I chuckled once and spent the remainder of the film looking at my watch.
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|The plot is intriguing, the characters interesting, the scenery beautiful...while the morals protrayed are not the everyday variety, they are still interesting.  The story line kind of peters out at the end and left us a bit unsatisfied...
B00947N6D8|4.0|At first glance, Rise of the Guardians (ROG) appears to be a rather odd concept.  Santa has tattoos and a thick Russian accent, the Easter Bunny is Australian and not particularly cute, and the Tooth Fairy looks like a hummingbird rather than a typical fairy.  I'll admit, when I first saw the advertisements and the trailer for it, I instantly dismissed this as a box office bomb working too hard to target a family audience.  Oh, how I was mistaken.<br /><br />This film is amusing, touching, has a message as well as characters you can relate to.  The film follows Jack as he struggles to find his \\"center\\" or purpose.  People hear his name from time to time, but nobody really knows who he is nor are they able to see him as they can Santa, ect.  With the help of his other guardian friends he is able to remember his past life and discover why the man on the moon created him.<br /><br />There what I would describe as \\"dark\\" scenes that might frighten younger or more sensitive viewers.  If adults are looking to watch this with the hope of some laughs, like Despicable Me, Monsters Inc., etc. they may be disappointed.  As I stated before, this film is more charming and amusing than funny.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|We loved this movie!  The plot, costumes, cast, setting, drama, and humor of this movie make it a rewarding watch!
B009AMANBA|3.0|Let's all be honest.  The main reason this film achieved so much was because of Daniel Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones.  Lewis nailed President Lincoln, from his accent to his mannerisms to his love of storytelling and witticism.  Lewis BECAME Lincoln.  Sally Field also did an excellent job portraying the mentally complex Mary Todd.<br /><br />However, all of this fine acting, great casting and pretty good writing is confounded by the disjointed plot.  Frankly, if I were ever to watch this again, I'll take notes so I can remember who is who and when things are occurring.  It is very difficult to remember who each character is because there are far too many of them, and then to try and remember which side they were on politically is also an arduous task.  The sheer magnitude of the number of characters in this film is overwhelming and, I believe, takes a very great deal away from the film.<br /><br />Another grievance is the fact that they don't lay out a little time line so viewers can know when things are occurring in relation to Lincoln's inevitable assassination.  They don't say, \\"February 21st, 1865\\".  Again, this can be confusing because a great deal of time passes between major plot points.<br /><br />Finally, there is far too much going on at one time.  From trying to pass the amendment to winning over lame duck democrats, to the civil war, to Lincoln's domestic trouble...  It was simply far too much for anyone to take in because the viewer was being bombarded with different story lines.<br /><br />In any event, I would recommend this purely for Jones and Lewis' acting performances because that is what made this film so popular.  As far as rewatch value, there really isn't any.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I read the book first.  The graphics and the reality protrayed in the movie are unbelieveable!  The story line is very close to the book.  I recommend this movie to anyone who like suspense!  The actors a really tremendous!
B000FA675C|5.0|This book challenges the senses and makes you wonder.  Is it true, real, false, make believe...it will provoke your inner self.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This woman's voice is something very special and should be cherished.  Her remarkable rising from unknown to world-wide recognition is amazing.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I love Game of Thrones.  The Blue-ray seems even more crisp and colorful than my HD television.  It arrived in just a few days, very fast shipping.  I've already pre-ordered season three.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Having lived through this time with our foster son, we wre intrigued!<br /><br />Everything about the movie was fantastic!  We felt that we were right in the thick of things throughout the whole movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Helps me to organize my finances. I like the big font. Easy to use. Thanks for making this app available and free.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is a tremendous movie based on real people!  The cast is superb, the settings beautiful and sumptuous, and the plot entertaining and touching!  We highly recommend it!
1780721676|4.0|I haven't read through the whole book but it does look interesting.  I have always heard that it is good for your body to fast once in a while and since you don't have to go without eating for the whole day makes it even more appealing.  Thank you!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is a very vivid enaction of the sentiments of the times along with the intrique that always goes on behind closed doors and behind the backs of others.  The realism portrayed is exceptional as are the complete cast, costumes, sets, and the plot.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I really liked the book and didn't expect the movie to be as good but it was.  Moves along with plenty of action and plot twists.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Having read the books repeatedly, I found that the first part of the book represented by this movie to be spot on!  The cast of characters, settings, graphics, music, and costumes are stupendous!  Can't wait for the second part!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Epic ending to one of the great fantasy stories of all time. Makes up for the 2 or 3 books in the middle where the story seemed to go nowhere. Brilliantly completed by Sanderson, Robert Jordan would have been pleased.
B008220C38|3.0|While the cast, costumes, sets, much, etc., are outstanding, the story is deprssing as is the book.  Other than to better understnd the history of those times, I couldn't recommend the movie to anyone.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Love the series & I fact that I can get it on Prime for free is even better! Looking forward to watching the rest of them.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What is not to like about Andrea Bocelli?  His voice is mesmerizing!  All of his recordings in our library are to be cherished and listened to repeatedly!
B0080CL0HM|1.0|If all Robert Pattison can do is grimace, smile at inappropriate times, and flare his nostrils, he is wasted in films beyond &#34;Twilight.&#34; He is shallow and one dimensional. ,<br />Many of the lines are bad, but they might as well be. Pattison would have destroyed good scripting.  His acting is rudimentary and unbelievable. Unable to finish the film and I have watched a lot of bad ones in my time.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Heard a cut from the CD at the end of a CSI: New York episode and knew that it was another great presentaion by Josh.  We have enjoyed the many times that we have listened to it.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Now, before you yell at me about the differences between stage and screen, I do know that they are different genres, and they present the works in different ways.  That having been said, I will begin with the things I did like.  Anne Hathaway's performance was breathtaking.  It is not the &#34;pretty&#34; version of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; we are used to, and that is not only ok, but completely appropriate.  Hugh Jackman is not Colm Wilkinson, but he did make the role of Jean Valjean his own.  I think having Colm on set was good for Hugh.  Colm could act as a mentor of sorts, and Hugh did a great job of showing the growth in Valjean over the course of the show.  Sasha Baron Cohen and Helenna Bonham Carter, two performers who I usually do NOT like, were fabulous in the roles of the Innkeeper and his wife.  They were deliciously evil and unscrupulous.  Cosset, who I usually find tedious, was portrayed in a much more in depth manner than I have usually seen, and I actually liked her.  Marius was good, but the actor has a sort of permanent smile on his face, which bothered me just a bit.  The student revolutionaries were magnificent.  Certainly a high point of the show.  Eponine was magnificent as well!<br />Now for the low points.  First and foremost, Russell Crowe was awful as Javert.  His singing voice was shallow, and his acting was one dimensional.  I would have much preferred an unknown who could sing and act over Crowe.  The only other thing that I did not like was the director's apparent fondness for showing bodily fluids, and I don't mean blood.  If I never see another sweaty face or runny nose again as long as I live, that will be fine!<br />With all of this, I would still recommend that anyone who likes musical theatre to see this.  If you have never seen Les Miserables, it is a must.  If you loved the stage version, you may have a few issues with this version, but keep an open mind.  After all, it is a different genre :)
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|While the plot, costumes, sets, cast, graphics, presentation and directing are outstanding, we both liked the stage production better.  For those who will not have that opportunity, we recommend the movie.  The documentary in the special features is worth the price of the DVD.
B005723JSQ|5.0|it's as funny as Shopaholic series yet adding tears and touching moments.. and I love the footnotes!  worth to read!
B007REV4T8|5.0|An outstanding plot, full of mystery and intrigue, the scenery is spectaculer, the graphics unbelieveable, and the acting superb.  What's not to like about another well done James Bond movie?
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a feel good and transformational sort of movie.  The acting, directing and writing all seemed to have a magic together.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is an excellent movie which realistically portrays how the whole process progressed and was concluded.  Having served with members of USNavy Seal Team Six and worked in the higher echelons in Washington, DC,  this is very true to how things work in that environment.<br /><br />It is sad to think that so many peoples lives were affected by the outcome of removing this one man from life.
B00000JMQE|4.0|good to have for a collectionist. if you are a follower of Oz, then you must have this. story and special effects are awesome.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|A bit rough around the edges and full of blood and guns.  The acting is excellent and the story line believeable.  The conclusion was worth a few times of my wife covering her eyes!
B006K1IIHA|1.0|I ordered these Blu-Rays and they didn't work when I put them in my PS3. Don't purchase them unless you want to be extremely disappointed.
1400052181|4.0|Amazing facts uncovered; sad in many respects. Good research on the part of the author...<br />Would love to read a follow up on Mrs. Lacks' descendants in years to come.
B00B22IJXK|1.0|I have the app Aviary and this is literally the EXACT same thing.  I feel like I've seen a lot of apps that copy Aviary.  Honestly, you cant create something even remotely similar to the photos shown
B006LSZECO|1.0|The main male character is irritatingly predictable, and annoying,  the &#34;cops&#34; are also.  I can't even force myself to get through this book, it's god-awful.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|We purchased this bag for our Nikon D5100, and it fits the camera and some accessories perfectly.  We don't have extra lenses so we didn't need the bulk of a bigger bag, and so far we have been very happy with the purchase. Good quality, too!
B0030B624E|4.0|Watch it often and it gets better and better, is it a complex and deep or thought provoking.....NO, it's funny mixed with well played actors.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|This series is like the updated version of the X-Files! Sometimes it does go a little bit over the top which is why it lost one of my stars. Overall, it is a very entertaining series for those who like to think outside the box.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I for one love this return CD! I feel like quite a few of these songs can be radio hits, so I'm very hopeful for them.
B0064QNS62|2.0|I got this as a free app of the day, played it for maybe five minutes and haven't touched it since.  Will probably uninstall it at some point.  The problem I encountered was being able to get him to jump while moving forward or grabbing for something and using it while moving.  For me, play was choppy and awkward.  Others may have a different experience--the screens looked like a Donkey Kong type game in terms of moving up levels to a goal which would have been fun if the controls were better.
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I love this show because it has you sitting on the edge of your seat. Plus, who doesn't love a little tension with the main characters and unexpected circumstances?
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Overall an enjoyable adventure game, I just felt like the game was sending me to the farthest corners of the game locations just for something to do.  The idea of having to change the seasons to accomplish specific tasks based on the conditions of that season made for a neat premise and the puzzles were challenging enough to be an enjoyable game.  There is a map you can access with regards to where  you are and where you want to go and the help function is very helpful.  I just felt like the game was running me around for the purpose of dragging out the game, not necessarily to make the game more of an adventure if that makes any sense.  It does draw out the play time, but it was a little annoying by the end.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The game is awesome because you are able to get dinosaurs, and level them up to get money to buy stuff.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game reminds me of an old computer game I have called Pandora's Box, which is a variety of different types of puzzles.  This is just jigsaw type puzzles, so it's not as good as Pandora's Box but it is a very enjoyable, simple app.  It doesn't require intense thought or concentration unless you're playing the challenge game or in a timed mode.
1616550414|5.0|the hyrule historia give you the opportunity to explore in a more wide way all the content in the skyward sword game and in the saga as a whole is an experence that gives a new form to understand this and other videogames
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Just a fun adventure game with puzzles to work out as you navigate through the world. It's a nice little time-waster when you have a little time to kill waiting for something.
B00AIBZJLG|5.0|It was an excellent combination of my favorite Cirque shows. I like how they linked them all together with the underlying story line. I've been sharing it with all my friends!
B004XQYBA2|5.0|This is a perfect app for Sudoku lovers.  There's a ton of puzzles ranging from Very Easy to Difficult, you can set the options to alert you when you enter an incorrect answer or play without any help at all.  It gives you a pencil option for a guess that you're not sure of or a pen option for answers you know and you can switch back and forth between pencil and pen within the same game. There's a pause function if you're timing yourself on how quickly you get through the puzzle and get interrupted by something and you can exit the app and come back later to pick up the puzzle where you left off.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|First, do not compare this excellent TV show to the sub-standard [[ASIN:B002LAZEIU State of Play]] with Russell Crowe. While the movie is \\"updated\\", and this BBC drama is arguably dated (just look at the technology in the news room), one gets a real feel for how the news industry can keep politicians (and others) in check.<br /><br />You'll watch this series again and again for the writing (including the relationships between the well developed characters), the scenes of London, and the uncanny ability of journalism to uncover real and relevant details.<br /><br />James McAvoy looks like he's about 17, with John Simm not much older. Bill Nighy only seems to play one kind of character (swaggering, similar to [[ASIN:B000A59PL0 The Girl in the Cafe]] and [[ASIN:0312318499 Love Actually]]), but you'll love him all the more for it. A news editor with a real backbone. The show crackles with energy from start to finish, and the unexpected ending will keep you guessing.
0765334798|3.0|Sci-fi fans will love this book. Based on the Star Trek phenomenon of the guy in the red shirt is the one who dies; this book told from the point of view of the characters, the writers, and the actors who played the characters. Confused? You'll have to read the book to see how it plays out, you won't be sorry. Loved the unique telling of the story by varying points of view.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|This movie is wonderful, for one big reason, & that is Denzel Washington! I really need not say more! He is perfection! Amazing & wonderful! Not to mention very sexy! All of his movies are great, & this one is too! To be fair though, everyone in the movie are also great! I thank everyone involved for making such a wonderful movie!
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Loved it and so did my daughters! Perfection!!<br /><br />You can not go wrong with this movie, perfect for a movie night!
B001KZVQJI|4.0|The quality of the blu-ray image is fine, and the disc does include both the theatrical and extended version of the film--that's the good news.  The bad news is that there are no other special features, so you still need the second &#34;special features&#34; disc of the 2 DVD set if you want to have the webcasts and other behind the scenes material.  If you already own the 2 disc DVD set, and you can get this blu-ray cheaply enough, it's worth the upgrade, as long as you keep the special features DVD.  If you don't care about special features and just want the best quality presentation of the film, then this blu-ray is also worth it.  If you are looking for something definitive, this isn't it.
B00005ATQF|2.0|They don't beat Marines...stupid Hollywood drama and the ending sucked - the producer was trying to be profound and artistic...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I totally think that you should really get this app...it is totally great!!!But don't spend your gems immediately cause you'll need them later.And don't purchase anything because it really does cost real money.But otherwise,it's the my fave app<br />(Littlest pet shop is also a great app.)
B005HE5J7I|5.0|London: The Novel is a panoply of the city's history beginning in pre-Roman days.  A great read for anyone who loves history since the book is true to established historical events and movements, and for anyone who loves to read novels which follow select families (fictional but representative) over generations.  Accessibly written, but with plenty of twists and turns in the coverage of the lives of its characters, including the historical ones.  Very enjoyable.
0439023491|5.0|Would you fight for the safety of your loves you even if your life depended on it? The book catching fire by Suzanne Collins is a great book I would recommend this book to someone else because it keeps your attention. It sets up more action for the reader in the book by significantly tieing up into one big puzzle by using many tributes from the past and present in the hunger games. Collins also tells us more about each district and how their important to the capitol by putting together Panem. She also show how dirty the capitol is and the president by making every tribute who won the hunger games from the past back in the arena fighting for their lives again. Not only that but the people of the capitol cheering and watching their death. Soon the new gamemaker will make a choice that will change the hunger games forever and everyone will remember just by choosing rebellion against the capitol.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Great band! Sort of a blues jazz, rock sound; fun to relax or work to.  Highly recommend this new group.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|A entertaining, thought provoking and deeply insightful book a 'doer' in every sense of the word. I highly recommend this book.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Great songs. I listen to this CD all the time. They are great artists. This was a very good purchase!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Way beyond what I expected,  everynight when I would get home from work I would pour myself a glass of wine and watch it.  I don't have T.V. so this has been great. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B004GYY714|3.0|Uninstalled. Can't save podcast to favs and have to search each time I want to listen to one. Waste of my time
B007IXWKUK|5.0|love this series! great for anyone who likes to read hot romance books. this series keeps you interested thru every twist and turn! cant wait to see how the movie turns out! nothing can beat the books tho!
B000002J1V|4.0|Thanks to the seller of this, it was in great condition - it was a gift for my husband that has an old 1987 truck that only has a tape player (the radio doesn't work) So he is stoked to have some good music to listen to when he does drive the old truck ...
B000053V7Q|5.0|love this! love watching elvis sing live! this is the best clips for his days on stage. would love to own another one like this
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I'm a 36 year old man, with a wife and a kid.  Typically I'm all about action/kung fu/horror movies.  I'll sit through Disney/Pixar (I really like some of them) but this has to be the first movie of its kind that I not only liked, but have watched multiple times...  When my wife wasn't home...<br /><br />I don't get it, I can't explain it, but I like it...  Strangely enough, I like it more than my wife (who bought it) does...
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I greeted the announcement of yet another reworking of Sherlock Holmes with dread. As a dyed-in-the-wool Sherlockian traditionalist and lover of Conan Doyle's written works, I detest as a rule any attempt to translate those works to the small or large screen.  I let down my guard for Jeremy Brett's masterful portrayal of Sherlock in the ITV series, especially when remained (largely) true to the original material, but that was the lone exception. Suffice it to say that \\"Sherlock\\" was a revelation and a shockingly welcome addition to the canon.  This reworking of the stories, transporting them to a different era and re-imagining the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, the creators of \\"Sherlock\\" have managed to remain true to the spirit of the originals while departing entirely from the original story lines.  What makes this series work is the intelligence of the writing and the truth of the portrayals of the principal characters.  Benedict Cumberbatch manages to capture Sherlock's essence with his Asperger's-inflected portrayal and rapier-sharp wit and his relationship to the police is well-imagined.  Dr. Watson, while not as memorable a figure, is solidly enough portrayed so as not to grate.  And the stories themselves are a treat.  The creators are playful enough to use the original titles as starting points while recreating the stories from whole cloth.  For the Sherlockians amongst us, little details are provided (the cab driver as the villain in A Study in Pink, the cell phone in the hidden safe in A Scandal in Belgravia, etc.) to keep us titillated.  Overall, the second season featured stronger story writing than the impressive first season, offering hope for increasing riches in the future.  Bravo to all involved!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is exactly what i look for in hidden object games. It is worth the money you pay for it. I recommend this game to anyone.
B008XX6J4C|1.0|I ordered 2 and paid for 2 of this CD and only received one. Not very happy. I rate the CD at a 5 but only rated this purchase as a 1.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is pretty good for a free app. it has lots of play time so far. only problem is that rooms repeat and always find same items but story line keeps it interesting.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app actually work really well as the other apps and this week in the city it very cool and allsome to use
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great look at what makes us tick as a society. Well written, spellbinding. Can hardly wait to hear about other silos.
B00C32R64G|5.0|I am a big fan of Volbeat and this album puts them over the top!  If you like Volboeat you will LOVE this album.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I have always been amazed by this book.Would I be able to find meaning if I were in Frankl's place?<br />Is it possible to find meaning in such an atmosphere?  It is possible for the author,but for the rest of the<br />world, I think not
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown is a fantastic author and I have loved everything I've read of his works. His storylines are gripping and I can't put down the book.
B00A757EFW|2.0|I was happy to play, then half way through a level it shut off and wanted me to buy the upgrade. That stinks.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really loved this app when I first got it. However, I'm a weather junkie. So, when I realized that it didn't update every 15 minutes like it said, I was disappointed. Sometimes, even after I refresh, it just won't update. :( However, if you're not obsessed with exact degrees, this app is full of information and is super easy to use. It's quick to pop up, and as long as you're not checking every 15 minutes exactly, you'll actually love this app.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|This is a good movie.  I loved it the first time I saw it and wanted it in my collection.  When I saw that Amazon had it available for the great price, I jumped at the chance to get it.  I have always been into movies like this.  Great to watch and great performances by Robert De Niro and Robin Williams.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it keeps me busy and the graphics are amazing it is a very fun and awsomes game I love it
B0090P98Z4|5.0|good but I want there to be offers for for free credits. that involved watching trailers . and that wen u do earn credits they instantly!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great read by one of this country's greatest ssoldiers, U.S. Navy Seal Chris Kyle. It gives a true accounting of the war in the Middle East and his role in it, free from all the political correctness of stateside news broadcasts.  A must-read for young and old, especially civilian, to see what our troops endure that this country may enjoy Freedom.
0805092447|5.0|My granddaughter has this read to her at daycare...she asked me to get it for her..which I naturally did.  She loves it!  Takes it whereever she goes.  Great book for little ones!
B002ZG98UA|4.0|the movie had a strange film on it and would not play at first but i put it through a dvd cleaner and it now works in both my dvd player and my blue ray player
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|As an avid Eagles fan, I wasn't worried about a set that had been remastered or touched up.  I wanted  the original recordings.  This set is well worth the money if you don't still have the original albums.  Thanks for the deal.
B009MF56GC|4.0|all seems to work well but the digital copy. i was not aware nor did i even consider the digital copy code may have already been used so in turn i can not watch it on my iphone if away from home.
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|She was brilliant!  This book is well written and sometimes astounds me in the elegance of her literary genius.  Wish she was still here.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie did her thing on this album!!!  Every song on here is Great.  Especially &#34;Two Black Cadillacs&#34;.  That's my fave!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Scary threats and intimidation is what this book entails but it is a worthwhile read because it is well written and it paints the picture of an abusive partner very well.  It is something to take note of because all abusers have certain characteristics and Elizabeth is right on in her painting of an abusive partner.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The path to the climax was very anti-climatic!  DeMille provided a wonderfully rich backdrop, helping me realize I never want to visit Yemen!<br /><br />The story's conclusion was OK.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Although Eban may have a different view on eternity than most I do respect him for putting his first hand experience in print and making it a worthwhile novel to celebrate
B004EWFUQY|4.0|It is very convenient to have this book and follow the diet phase by phase. Even though the diet itself is not working fast enough for me. You have to practice iron will to follow this diet to the letter. I hope to be able to reach my target weight with the help of this book.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This was my first Michael Connelly novel and I'm now completely hooked. I love his writing style and the way he moves his characters through the plot. Once you start it's hard to put the book down until you get to the end - makes for a long night. I look forward to many more good reads with Mr. Connelly.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is Carnival Fun that I remember.  Except. that I got a real chance to win. Great level -up are a reachable goal. So much fun. The graphics are great and I can almost smell the popcorn. Easy to play and 30 second free coins are great incentive to play and buy coins.
B007NR9WBG|5.0|Ever since viewing this in the Movie Theater many years ago, I fell in love with the beauty and charm of Natalie Wood. So sad the way she died. Alas, this movie was ahead of its time. The story line, special effects (wonderful) and the acting were superb. Walken was a little dry but then again he is a mysterious actor. The blue ray disc is unique in that you have scenes in the 4:3 aspect ratio and then some outdoor scenes show while the 1st person is experiencing the effects of wearing the headset of &#34;brainstorm&#34; tech.<br />  This is a must have your video collection. All of my close friends who are under 40 have not seen it but were surprised that it got under their radar.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|My favorite game of this kind so far. Fun and entertaining and with a touch of excitement! Need more games like these.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|One of the best books I've read for awhile. It's the kind of Novel that makes a person appreciate freedom. Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful writer.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This movie was ok, but seemed like a long episode of Family Guy, I will not go into detail about similarities as to not give away anything; but the movie is simply ok.
B00BV2M9LO|4.0|This title has received quite a number of negative reviews. Disappointing.  Was it classic Crichton? As intriguing or as tense as either Prey or Disclosure? No.  What it was was exciting.  I do not read fiction novels to find myself rooted within our pedantic and predictable world.  I want a story that puts me in another world, another reality where I can suspend belief in this HotPocket and Pay-at-the-Pump convenience and entitled world.<br /><br />Micro did this.  It was an adventure.  Do I find it plausible that humans and equipment can be reduced to a half-inch? Probably not.  But wouldn't it be exciting if we could?<br /><br />As usual with Crichton's books, our antagonists find themselves in a difficult situation from which not everyone can survive.  Parts of it seemed rushed. But otherwise, an enjoyable read.
B00BHMF578|4.0|The action builds up nicely and the tension peeks at a high level.  Not the best movie you will ever see, but worth renting for sure.
B00A0MJ9ZA|5.0|Great for younger children. My boys age 3 and 5 loved it and I felt that it was an age appropriate movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this app is the best because. You go running through all of these cool obstcles and you never know when to turn so your mind plays a trick on you.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|It had its funny parts but dragged on way too long for a comedy.  After so long it didn't hold interest.  A little disappointed.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love this show! Keeps me glued to the screen with every change in the course of Emily's revenge. I'm so glad I stumbled on this show!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|this is a fun game to pass the time.  the tutorial is helpful and it has both a single player and multi-player mode
B00C7L8DM2|5.0|Good movie with a fair plot.  It was a little predictable.  But still fun to watch.  I would own it.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|[UPDATE:] After reading other reviews that this is not just using the AVIARY engine, but just a REPACKAGING of Aviary, I checked out the claims and found the claims are TRUE!  Nor, as others have pointed out, does this app have some of the capabilities of the screenshots; I apologize for missing that in my review.<br /><br />PROS:<br />+ Simple, nice tools<br />+ Capable \\"quick and dirty\\" editor<br /><br />CONS:<br />- BLATANT COPY OF >FREE&lt; \\"AVIARY\\" APP!<br />- NO Undo<br />- NO Layers<br />- NOT FOR PROFESSIONALS<br /><br />[ORIGINAL REVIEW]<br /><br />This is a nice demonstration application which shows off the underlying engine well, and presents some excellent User Interface capabilities.  An example of which is the \\"thumbwheel\\" scroll wheel at the bottom which does a nice simulation of a mechanical wheel, and is an intuitive control.  The options at the bottom are, for the most part, understandable as to what each function/tool does.  There are some useful tools, and this can be a quick and dirty editor that will yield acceptable results for some circumstances as well as fun artistic playfulness.<br /><br />Beyond getting to choose whether you want to use a photo or a blank canvas when the app starts, there are no menus or options other than the tool buttons at the bottom.  Note, by the way, that the app starts up rotating into Portrait (why is a mystery).  Once inside the app, however, you can rotate back to landscape.  The tools are fairly self-explanatory, and you can play with the settings without applying them first.  This is good, but also means that if you forget to apply the tool or you apply something by accident, you are not going to be happy that there's no undo or layers.<br /><br />But, as mentioned, this seems more like a demo app for the Aviary engine that \\"powers\\" this app.  And this is a little concerning because the Aviary SDK that runs this app is free for adding into this type of application but relies on IN-APP PURCHASING for generating revenue.  I cannot say whether Draw Infinity would ever add IAP, but it is worth mentioning that this might be an income model that the developer chooses, or is forced, into making.<br /><br />The different features work well, and are simple to use.  But scrolling and zooming is not easy, since you have to touch the magnifying glass icon to do that while you're in a tool, and only a few tools allow pinching and zooming.  Also, you have to \\"Apply\\" the tool once you're satisfied with the outcome.<br /><br />BUT it is missing the most basic of professional tools: NO \\"undo\\" and NO \\"layers\\".  Sorry, you also cannot export to different file types.  To good news, at least, is that it is a non-destructive editor, saving a copy of the image instead of overwriting the original image.<br /><br />This is fun little editing software for the novice, and at 99-cents (but not more) it is a pretty great little editor that will provide a lot of fun for people.  It just isn't for serious artists or professionals.<br /><br />[EDIT: Expanded and added at the top of review.]venue.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Very good season.  Change of enemies but equally as good as the previous seasons.  I can't wait for Season 4.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I really hadn't heard, other than very vaguely, about a &#34;slender man&#34;.  I always assumed it was the Enderman in Minecraft, which were inspired by the Slender Man.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the Enderman in Minecraft are much more scary than this game.<br /><br />This game has a nice immersive feel, and I enjoyed running around the dark, foggy woods.  However, with little explanation or instruction, it isn't terribly fun to play.  Also, when you get killed by the Slender Man, you usually don't see him.  You just die, wondering what the heck just happened.  So much for that last 10 minutes that are now, apparently, completely wasted.  You start over, and realize that you are no closer to understanding how to play this game than when you started four games earlier.<br /><br />Slender Man! Ch. 1: Alone has potential with the atmosphere, the realistic sounds, and great 3-D engine.  But it feels like it's still an Alpha release that is missing a good deal of intended content and storyline.  BUT, it's worth the 99-cents for the experience of how good a 3-D immersive environment on an Android tablet could be, and around Halloween this is likely to be something worthwhile to show off.  I just want more explanation of what's going on instead and what's expected of the player.  That, and more content inside those illustrious landscapes.
B004LWZW6K|3.0|saw the first one made sense undergound lake that had alot of pirahna waiting to get out they ate each other to survive great flick saw this one and i have movies with Panaber in them the crazys and mr. brooks she was great in this one to but the movie was ok
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was thoroughly enjoyable and I absolutely LOVED the concept of the Night Circus. So beautifully creative and well-thought out! The romance between Celia and Marco was tender and sweet, though at times I struggled to pinpoint exactly what it was that so strongly attracted them to each other, as they spent so very little time together for the majority of the story. I enjoyed the variety of characters and Chandresh's midnight dinners as well. From a descriptive standpoint, it's a very rich story, filled with wonderfully detailed imagery! From a plot standpoint, it wasn't quite as strong. (Spoilers ahead!)<br /><br />While I was all too eager to get lost in the circus, I found the vagueness of \\"the challenge\\" very frustrating. While the author attempts to wrap it up at the end during Widget's conversation over wine with the mysterious man in the grey suit, it still didn't quite satisfy. It's a challenge to the death of one of the opponents, and yet there are no rules and so little information about why they are competing. And then we learn it is simply a disagreement in style between two old... what, magicians? Wizards? Just guys who have figured out how to harness the power of the universe? We never do learn what they truly are. To me it also seems a little silly that this challenge has to end in death - isn't that a little extreme given that they are simply showcasing their abilities rather than engaging in direct combat? And with all the lead up to the big challenge, it was surprisingly tame and slow moving. Years and years of whimsical tents being erected pretty much sums it up. I kept wondering how either one of them would eventually die as a result of their circus endeavors - exhaustion maybe?<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this book and would give it five stars for creativity and writing style. It's very unique, charming, and fun to read. I would give the plot three stars because of the vague and murky \\"challenge\\" that ties it all together, so I guess that averages it out to four stars.
B0002J4X1Q|5.0|saw the first when it came out love it then bought the second then third had to get one four and five love them all
B004SBS8LA|4.0|It's fun.  It's a little harder than the other Angry Bird games but you'll enjoy it if you like Angry Birds.
B009MO57H6|5.0|had resident evil 2 love it then bought the third and had to het one four and five love them all
B000FA675C|4.0|I actually downloaded this book so I could read the beginning of Inferno as I had read the DaVinci Code when the book first came out.  I'm so looking forward to being able to purchase Inferno when it comes out.  it is scheduled for release on May 14, 2013.  Can't wait.
B002ZG99IG|5.0|saw this on amazon.com dvds and thought it looked good so brought it and it rocked like to see more movies with the leading ladies
B005HSL626|4.0|My grandson downloaded this on my Kindle while his was recharging.  He loves the game.  His brother also has it.  They are 5 and 8 and they play it every day.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|saw this movie lots of time there isn't to many movies where you watch finish then watch again right after you watch it  jumper is one of them i rented watched hit menu and watched the whole thing again
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I must say when I heard FOB was coming back I was thrilled yet skeptical. I didn't think they'd be able to live up their former potential. FOB over the years with their albums have always made it clear that they never quite keep their sound the same. While Patrick is always the lead and Pete always writing the lyrics, everything else always changed. For better and for worse I must admit. Listening to this album I was pleasantly surprised with how they seemed to mix the past four albums into something that actually all worked together, almost seamlessly. This album deserves a good shot. Alot of people again like with the past few FOB albums love to hate on it. but what made FOB so good was that they don't conform to what the reviewers want. They go with what they want, and I believe that's given them the longevity and ability to come back after a few years and still make good music.<br /><br />While the rest of the mainstream rock/alt. rock scene is struggling to find bands that last the ages, I believe FOB will always be a band worth listening too.<br /><br />While most of you are thinking this review is strongly biased, I will have to agree, However know that I dont buy albums lightly. I believe in supporting the bands by buying their music, but most are not album worthy anymore. I have purchased every single one, loving and hating each FOB album along the way.<br /><br />I plan on listening to this album for weeks on end. I have to learn every word after all :P
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I don't play many games. My granddaughter (16) thought this looked like a fun game, so we downloaded it.<br />We both love this game. I can't give it more stars because of the intrusive pop-up that take you to other pages.<br />Then again, it is free.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I could not put this book down!!!  The story is fantastic but I also enjoyed the history in it.  A must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|This is my favorite Star Trek series.  Enjoyed the characters.  Thought they had more depth than some of the other series.  The interplay between Quark and Odo was great.  Also nice to see Jake grow up.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|Now I can make my own sayings to a pic w/o the need of a PC.  Great paint implementation I love the fact Im able to use much easier than sketch
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Amazing insight about the cooperation among sitting and former Presidents.  Bipartisanship at its finest. Should be required reading for Congress.
B0037YOMWS|4.0|I received the calculator very soon! And the package was definitely very nice and new. Haven't really started to use it yet, so can't say more about it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|My daughter loved it. It is always great to get your books delivered right to your Kindle. It is a hassle free process:)<br />We love amazon.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Simple easy fun to unwind with at the end of the day... I recommend.<br />High game Berman very friendly real
B00004XQ83|4.0|The songs I remembered from the film were all there.<br />Some other song were less memorable.<br />Still, glad I bought it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this story. I dont know what else to say.<br />I could not put this book down.  Very good twist at the end. I can't wait to read book 3
B008393Q2O|4.0|I like this notepad app, it's like post it notes on my Kindle Fire. Only thing I would change is it would be cool to have more colors for the notes.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|This novel started a bit  slow , but then kept you riveted to see what would happen. Half way through it started to feel like she was beginning to know it was her husband. 3 stars
B007U8U1V8|5.0|I have been a fan of White Stripes, Raconteurs, and Dead Weather so I was looking forward to this music. It took me a few listens to pick my favorites. I'm Shakin', Hypocritical Piece (love the piano), same with Weep Themselves To Sleep (love the piano), and On And On And On. I have been listening to this on my daily walks. I see why it got the Grammy nomination.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Great entertainment. The story either reaches a peek or leaves a cliffhanger in almost every chapter. But beware: Loss of sleep is a common side effect (from not being able to stop reading)
B002KCO6QA|4.0|entertaining syfy journey. I certainly enjoyed viewing this flick.  I definitely recommend this movie to kill some time and kick back.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I CHOOSE THIS RATE CASUE I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH.... I CAN LOOK AT THIS ALL DAY THANKS VERY MUCH!!!!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I really like that it has the different bands and singers in a category with their songs with them. It's much more convenient than YouTube.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH THAT EVERY TIME THAT I LOOK AT IT I CRY CAUSE OF THE STAR THAT PLAY IN IT EVEN THOUGHT SHE IS GONE SHE WILL BE MISS VERY MUCH
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole trilogy was a surprise to me. Not what I expected, which was a good thing. I couldn't put it down!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app, it is so child friendly and interactive! It has daily challenges and you can win and save coins to, for example, get a new character!! It has broken the mould set by Temple Run and Angry Gran Run, and quite frankly I prefer it by far!!! Would recommend any day, go and buy it!!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Because of Sunday night football I never took the time to check out this show and didn't want to start in the middle of a season.  Now I realize no matter how much I love football I should have been recording this.  Thanks to my Prime acct I will be able to see it all the way thru.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book never had a boring or bad moment in it. A great read. Buy it you won't regret it
B009AMANH4|5.0|Having taught an American History In Film class for years, I have seen the &#34;good, bad and ugly&#34; of history films.<br />This film is in the category--with Saving Private Ryan, Glory, and even more 13 Days in October--of a great film<br />about a very difficult to describe event (the passage of the 13th amendment). Its strengths have been well covered<br />elsewhere. I agree completely and bought it to be able to see the performances and story over again any time I<br />wanted.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|All of the other books that I have read, and I read every Seal book, this one bothers me because he never got it review by the Seal Team, the Pentagon, or anyone else.  Used the excuse that our politicians released all of the information he reveeled in this book, so he felt he did not have to get permission.  I am sure his brother seals don't feel this way.  He signed an oath not to discuss his missions without authorization.  Other seals have written such books and they have the blessing of our government.<br />It was a good read, but I question his motives for writing.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|As a lifelong Tolkien fan, I looked forward to the 3-4(?) part series from Jackson.<br />He had done so well with LOTR (my favorite trilogy) that this movie could have disappointed.<br />But it did not. It was a blast and I hope the next installments are as good.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book shows that even in time of war the enemy can have compassion.  It true showed how our Seals as dedicated to complete the missions that put them in harms way on everyday on the battle field.<br />It was told in a manner that gave credit to the other Seals that made the ultimate sacrifice to save one of their own.<br />The story was told so well you see every bullet fly and feel the fear even these warriors feel.<br />Great read and great warrior and hero that shared this with us.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved having this series to share. If you haven't see this series, it is awesome. It is great for anyone to watch and enjoy what life was like many years ago as well as the lifestyle of the extremely rich.
0812993845|5.0|Lottie Graveney is about to be engaged....she's sure of it!!!  Longtime boyfriend Richard is taking her out for a \\"special dinner\\" and wanted to know if \\"she liked his surname\\"....whatever else could it be??  Lottie's told the world....but when it becomes clear at dinner that at the end of it she will still be completely and utterly ringless, she dumps the baffled Richard.  Loving big sister Fliss is waiting for Lottie to call and tell her all about The Big Proposal....but quickly figures out that there wasn't one.  Fliss then launches into Big Sister Protection mode......and begins to worry about the possibility of the Unfortunate Choices......something that ALWAYS occurs after a Lottie break-up (the cult...the tattoo....the intimate piercing)......what will happen this time?  Even Fliss could not have predicted what was to transpire next....<br /><br />Rollicking fun, written with Kinsella's natural comedic flair that her fans have come to love.  The protagonist is also signature Kinsella; fun, flakey, with a knack for at least attempting to make sense into the nonsensical.....great book and highly recommended.<br /><br />DYB

1451627297|5.0|Was a great deal. I am so glad I took the chance and bought a used book.  Mr. King did not disappoint.  It was a great read!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great cover, does its job.  Doesn't stick as a stand very well - I have problems making it stick probably half the times I use it.  But it just takes some readjusting an it'll stick.  If I brought my Kindle around more (more banging around, wear and tear) I might get a heavier duty case.  My Kindle just lives at my house, in my bookbag, and comes with me when I travel so is not at much risk of being dropped or hurt.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|the best the best it is awesome better than the first one please make updates who. ever made this game is awesome I love it the best game on kindle fire,!!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I enjoy this app on my kindle fire.  Other than it locking up occasionally, I have no complaints. Would recommend.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I like dat the cards actually do stuff. I wasn't expecting this ga.e to b as fun as it is
B000VDUWMC|5.0|Insightful, well-written, fascinating account of how the world's peoples and the geopolitical power they hold became who they are today.  A fact-based, research-based account of how the modern human world was formed, why some have a lot and others have so little.  Increased my understanding of where we came from, how got to where we are, and where we need to go in the future.  A must read for anyone interested in having a better understanding of our world.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I really loved this show. I hadn't seen the first season but I didn't have any trouble following the storyline. It got my attention right away. I really enjoyed the characters and the plots. Great price too.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|i love this series.  Each year i am waiting to see what will unfold and each year i re-watch the show to refresh my brain and relive the excitement.
B0087ZG7PW|4.0|This is a good movie for family viewing, but not for young children under the age of 7 or so.
1781161097|4.0|Books like these typically fight wars with each other over concept art vs. set photographs. This one clearly favors concept art, but at the expense of many &#34;final result&#34; photographs that help bridge the two. The text thankfully makes up for the gaps in technical detail, but still in general ways that might be redundant for people who would use this as a bible for making their own model effects. Still, it's collectible as there are very few PROMETHEUS products out there to buy; given that I was too young to buy stuff like this when the first ALIEN films came out, I didn't want to pass this up.<br /><br />So while interesting and thorough--and FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH ILLUSTRATIONS--it's not particularly educational, but is enjoyable. AND it's a sturdy little hardcover that fits on a regular shelf too, which is a plus.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This book reads like a soap opera.  Readers could mental whiplash while back tracking to make sure they read what they thought they read.  Game changing...pun intended!
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a very good game. It can keep you busy and well distracted.<br />I enjoyed this game a lot.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|While there isn't a lot of action in book two I was completely engrossed in the story lines.  Every fantasy series I have read has a book that builds up the story rather than play out events and Clash of Kings was just that.
B00BAB6CLY|4.0|After six months of waiting, the second half of the House of Gold and Bones story is finally here. When I initially heard that they were splitting this into two releases my first reaction was \\"why?\\", but after hearing the album front to back numerous times it's very clear. House of Gold and Bones, Part 2 is an entirely different beast. I was expecting the album to pick up where the first half left off, but that isn't necessarily the case. Instead, Part 2 is extremely melancholic and much more atmospheric. So I'm just going to get this out there right now: If you thought the first entry was too soft then don't even listen to this. There's a 99.9% chance that you won't enjoy it.<br /><br />Of course the main point of these albums was to tell a story so I'll get that out of the way first. Just like Part 1, Part 2 contains a booklet picking up where we left off at the end of Part 1. I was excited to read the end to the story because 1) I found it interesting and 2) I wanted to see if my theory was correct and, for the most part, it was. Now I'm not going to spoil it for anyone, but essentially the story is about finding who you are and being able to accept yourself and the decisions you've made. No one's perfect and the sooner you realize this the happier you will be.<br /><br />Unfortunately, just like Part 1, the music on this album doesn't really reflect the story in any way. Aside from the song titles there's almost no connection between the story and the content in the songs. I'll admit that this was a little disheartening, but at the same time it felt somewhat expected. I stand by what I said in my review for Part 1, artists use the term \\"concept album\\" too loosely these days. Don't get me wrong, the whole idea behind this album was fantastic and the fact that they made a comic series for it is exciting, but that whole story could've been a side project. Instead it feels a little misleading when the music feels like a different entity when compared to the House ofGold and Bones story.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, sonically this album is very different from the first entry. Surprisingly, Part 1 was the heavier half while Part 2 feels darker and the listener feels a sense of hopelessness. The highs are higher and the lows are lower. You feel the raw emotion in Corey's vocals and that greatly enhances the listening experience. What I found interesting with the album was the amount of diversity from one song to the next. This album has more of a Hard Rock vibe that occasionally strays into Alternative territory. With some songs having a similar structure to the earlier works of 3 Doors Down.<br /><br />Of course Corey isn't the only member of the band and I'm happy to report that everyone else involved did a phenomenal job. Roy's drum performance, in particular, is noteworthy. There were a few listens where I found myself so invested in his drumming that I didn't hear anything else that was going on. Great work on his part. There were a few times where the guitars and bass guitar kind of blended together to the point where it was hard to make out which was which, but it wasn't a big issue.<br /><br />Lastly, one thing that really put a smile on my face was the fact that the last three songs all contain reprises from Part 1. \\"Do Me a Favor\\" contains a reprise of \\"A Rumor of Skin\\", \\"The Conflagration\\" contains a reprise of \\"The Travelers\\" (both parts), and \\"House of Gold and Bones\\" contains the same melody as \\"Absolute Zero\\". Sadly, we didn't get \\"The Travels Part 3 and 4\\". However, in its place we were given \\"Blue Smoke\\" which takes place right before \\"Do Me A Favor\\". Let me just say that it surpasses \\"The Travels\\" in basically every category. It's contains the vibe that was present in both entries, but it's amplified by 100%. Couple that with the rough sounding vocals and you're given a spine tingling performance. Definitely one of the more emotionally driven songs on the album.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Peckinpah\\" & \\"TheUncanny Valley\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.75/10 - I must say that it's been interesting to see how this concept panned out. I'll admit that I expected something different going into these albums, but it would be wrong to deny that both entires are extremely good. The story itself has a nice ending and the title song, while not as strong as \\"Last of the Real\\", ends things on a good note. Plus, it's probably the only song that feels like an appropriate representation of what went on in the story. If you're a fan of Stone Sour or just good music then I would definitely recommend checking this out. However, if you didn't enjoy the first entry because you thought it was too melodic then I would recommend skipping this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Was surprised just how good this Bible or should I say Bibles are, as there is so many versions to chose from. I recommend highly for the Kindle.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|if you lose or misplace your USB cable for your Kindle, this is the cable to order from Amazon. the product was shipped promptly and was packaged in a padded envelope.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Great performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins and some very interesting behind the scenes information about Hitchcock, but slow as molasses and could almost be considered a documentary more than a feature film.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Good Heavens Gracious! Can I just say Jamie McGuire you did an excellent job!! Okay so Im going to start off by saying I will not ruin anything about this book but evert line I read I feel even more in LOVE with the book! The way it started was just somehting that I love! I love TRAVIS!!! That cocky bastard! This book has everything you need to go from feeing incredibly angry and frustrated to laughing to crying to just every possible emotion! I was just amazed how this book turned out! I love the title it goes perfectly with what Pigeon and Travis are! I love love love how from the very beggining he called her Pigeon and when I figured out the meaning to it I just fell in love all over with the book! I read it all in one night I couldnt put it down!! I read and re-read over and over agian about 5 times!! This is a book I recommended to alot of my friends and well they agree with me! They all ended up purchasing the book! And the way you wrote one in Travis's point of veiw just blew me away!!! This book made my Top Ten! I could even say my Top 5!!! Great Job Great Boook! Great Author! I would totally love to see more of your work like this!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Wow, I was blown away by John Hawkes and it's so good to see Helen Hunt back on the scene.  Lots of full frontal nudity from Helen in this one, I was kind of shocked and wondered why it was even necessary.  So, know that going into it if that sort of thing bothers you.  Definitely not one for 18 or younger to be in the room because of that, otherwise, I highly recommend it.
B004USRKX8|5.0|I would recommend this for any Crosby die hard fan. Great guitar playing, and his vocals never get old. A great addition to your Crosby collection.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is an alarm and it works as such. I wish it came with additional alarm sounds though. It. Is a great alarm.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|The previews made this movie out to be funnier than it actually was.  While it did have its funny parts, it was too long and had too many slow parts.  It did do a good job of portraying a 40 year old couple who are experiencing a stale relationship, financial problems, and family problems.  Just not what I was expecting I guess.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Really like this game so far. The graphics are nice, and the game takes you through the story nicely.Rating it 5 stars.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Good in every way. Finely crafted and easy to use. Very powerful and feels good in the hand. I love it.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved these books. The story line was great and kept you hooked. I could not stop reading them!
B004JMZPJG|4.0|Nice bag, fits well my Nikon D600 with the 24-85mm kit lens with about an inch to spare length wise. Can also hold the charger in the side pockets. Four starts because it's got only one zipper it can be a bit hard to open when on your shoulder.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This is a great book because of life experiences mentioned that allows for personal reflection to change. I really enjoyed and willing to apply to my life. Thanks!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a very cute and fun game for all ages. However, this game is so FUN it can be addictive if not played with care.
B00C32R64G|5.0|...just sayin'. i have about 15 items lined up to be reviewed and i'd rather not spend the time to review EACH of them. thanx.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love that there are three different levels of difficulty for this game! Depending on the day I may not always want to play something super challenging and this game you can tailor to fit your mood. Plus, when the kids want to play, I can adjust the difficulty settings to meet their individual abilities! Well done! Thank you!
B004EPZ070|1.0|I think this movie STINKS on every level from plot to writing to direction to score/soundtrack.  There's not an original moment in this piece of drek.  The acting is inauthenic---and how could it not be given the sadly one-dimensional characters these actors are given to play---and painful to watch.  How anyone over the chronological or mental/emotional age of 10 could rate this thing with more than 1/2 stars is unfathomable (I would have given it no stars if I could have).  Someone once told me in order to be a fair critic of anything one needs to find at least one positive thing about the subject being critiqued; I think the lead, whoever he is, has well-developed pectorals.  And so ends my brief review; I've already used more words and thought this movie is worth.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Erik and Andrew explain that when all the government officials, business owners and consultants discuss the unemployment situation, no one talks about the effects of automation. After reading this book, you will have a different perspective on our current state of unemployment, a better understanding of why companies are doing well without hirring and what you need to do to prepare for the workplace of the future. There is not a lot of good news here, but there is an awful lot you can learn.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Bought this album 2 days ago, and I can't stop listening to it. Alt J has a truly unique sound and I can't get enough of it!
B00A80SHFM|3.0|After seeing the 25th anniversary broadway show on PBS I can only say the Actors in the film version can not compare!  But the 25th anniversary verson.
B002N2SYWE|5.0|Omg very creepy - a friend recommended it to me since im a horror fan enjoyed it and glad I took the chance subtitled if your into it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Amazing; the battle between Rick & The Governor was epic fun.  Can't wait till Season 4 and how the groups combine!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This great post-apocalyptic fiction novel had me pretty early on. It explored the politics of a fallout shelter very well. It lost one star because it dragged on a little towards the end as the writer stalled the inevitable conclusion.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|I'm not going to spend time beating a dead horse about how great their first album was. Instead I'm going to write about how great THIS album is! It appears (so far) that people either love it, hate it or think it falls short compared to their first album. I think it surpasses their first album. The new album is Ghost becoming Ghost. The first album had a bunch of great, catchy songs. But Infestissumam is the direction I was hoping Ghost would take. If I were to describe this album to someone unfamiliar with the band I would tell them to imagine if Rosemary's Baby was a play performed inside a circus where everyone was tripping on LSD and then you might have an idea what to expect. Everything has been improved upon. The sound, the multi-layered and complexity of the songs creates the ideal atmosphere for the listener. Some songs do take a little longer to grow on you than others but the entire album is good. Definitely not a filler track to be found. And while the obvious choices for the first singles: Secular Haze & Year Zero are excellent I feel the real gems are Ghuleh/Zombie Queen & Monstrance Clock.<br />I noticed many people refer to the opening track as comparable to the opening track from their first album. I disgree. Yes, it's the intro and yes it's an instrumental but I feel it picks up where Genesis left off...and I see a concept even bigger than ONE album which I'll get to in a minute.<br />Other highlights for me are Per Aspera Ad Inferi and Depth of Satan's Eyes. Both are very gothic, sinister and charming. This is where Black Metal/Death Metal whatever the hell it's called these days fails. When you start off screaming your @$$ off and playing as fast as humanly possible right out of the gate with no direction you lose your appeal. Where do you go from there? There's no atmosphere, no melody, no imagination required. So when people complain Ghost isn't heavy enough to be playing Satanic music I chuckle to myself. Because all that \\"noise\\" being made from other bands just gives me a headache. Ghost lures you in and seduces you...with melody, hypnotic flow, trance-like choruses...so if someone wants to turn me to the dark side Ghost would be the band to do it. Heavy-ness is not satanic, sorry. Deception is...and that is what Ghost does best.<br />I also feel like their influences are showing through on this album more than ever before. While I agree you can hear bits and elements of bands like Mercyful Fate, Black Sabbath, Boston and B.O.C...their main influences The Beach Boys and The Doors really come through on Infestissumam.<br />I'm really looking forward to the next album now. I think I see a pattern here. The first album was a warning of the coming of seed. Their second album is the arrival/birth...and I can only imagine and hope their third album deals with the consequences of this birth...and it's growth.<br />But whatever, I'm definitely gonna be along for the ride.<br />So, yeah, this is like my opinion...and everybody has one. Hail Ghost!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|This was purchased for my children who are Star Wars junkies.  They play the Wii Lego Star Wars game and during the movie proceed to explain where in the game each scene is.  We are very happy with the product.
4770031246|5.0|Vibrant pictures, step by step instructions, common ingredients that are easy to get and healthy for you. What more can you ask for? Not to mention that these lunches are extremely healthy, so easy to put together, and very, very fun to eat, especially for youngsters who are picky eaters.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old and my 7 year old sons who have become obsessed with Star Wars.  They love it but it's Star Wars, who doesn't love it?!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I almost wanted to buy it for me, but it was originally for Christmas gifts. Great movie for kids and adults alike. Totally recommend it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence does an incredible job as Katniss Everdeen in this movie. I think it still is one of those that is easier to understand if you have read the book, but I enjoyed seeing my imagination come to life in the set and the costumes
1451627297|5.0|Unusual story for Stephen King, but excellently written. a real page turner. Don't let the size of the book scare you.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Wow. So good. Just so so good. If you are a geek at heart or just enjoy a well told story then pick up Ready Player One. I've been wanting to read this for so long now and I bought it last night. I had butterflies in my belly before I even flipped open the first page.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|The idea of using an expanding stage set was interesting at first but became a total distraction from the story.  The acting leaned toward excess and melodrama.  Wrong guy for the Vronsky!
B00024I2Z4|4.0|I saw this movie many years ago when it came to the theaters and I loved it.  Now that I have children, I found that they enjoy as much as I did.  Unfortunately, the two disk set came in less than perfect condition.  Both of the disks were scratched and one had tons of spots on it. I can't help but think that perhaps this is why the price dropped about $20 than when it was first listed.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My daughters thought this was a very funny movie. The quality was perfect. I will be buying all my movies from Amazon.
B005FISBTO|5.0|JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST 5 SEASONS. CAN'T WAIT FOR #7 TO COME OUT ON DVD!! DEXTER IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES EVER. JUST WISH IT HAD BEEN ON ONE OF THE MAIN CHANNELS AND THAT WE DID NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT ON SHOWTIME!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is well-written with a great sense of humour that you wish your friends all have, structured in a way that even the most logical mind will approve, and yet on a subject that might just seem too far-out.<br /><br />Don't believe in 'the field' or 'the laws of attraction\\"? That's fine. I'd suggest using it as a 'mind training' book then. Going through the book even without doing any of the experiments will show you just how inefficient your mind is set up and how you can improve on that. I've had a great time reading it (perhaps the best since oh-I-don't-know-when).
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I am so thrilled by this application. I am going to use it for homeschooling my children. Thank you! If you made an application that was set up for homeschooling records that would be even better but I am not complaining.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved the 8 POV.<br />Intriguing.<br />Unexpected.<br />Cannot wait to read the rest of the series.<br />All you co yo lending ask for in a book.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Always wanted to have it in my collection of science fiction, after the Star Wars, this is one of my favorites.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Of course, this was another great movie!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|A very interesting concept.  Sometimes the story takes you to an uncomfortable place but then it brings you back.  Phew!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would've liked a better ending. Although I understood the reasoning behind why the other did what she did, i still wanted more.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Such a great movie,  beautifully filmed - get out your tissue box!  This is a great movie for horse lovers, but I think it is too intense for most children.
B005S9EK5Y|3.0|I like musicals like Mama Mia, but didn't realize in this movie every line is sung.  Just not my cup of tea.
B00782O7IY|5.0|Highly suggested....a remake of an old movie.  Watched this with some deaf friends (by the way - this movie is totally silent).
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Great and you don't want to lay it down. Very suppensful and shows how much goes into these novels.Great Reading.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Loved it. Read very smoothly. Didn't know what perspective it would be. Pleasantly surprised. I'm a new fan of Mira Lyn Kelly
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Well-acted, without undue deference to the legend.<br />It's almost reassuring to see that Washington has ALWAYS been a swamp of narrow self-interest, parochialism, and greed. What we have today is not a modern phenomenon.<br />It's just as disturbing, though, to note how the caliber of leadership in the White House has declined, over the same century and a half. Where are the Washinrons, the Lincoln's, the Roosevelt's, or the Teagan's?
B006RUJST6|5.0|2nd time reading and just fell in love all over again.  Getting reacquainted with all of the characters before This Girl comes out on April 30th.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game!  I try to beat my coin score as well as my survival time...a little competitive!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Understated humor, reminded me of James Herriots writing. Laughing and crying--this book has both of them. I hope Ms. McKenna continues the story.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|the musicality of these young singers is amazing.  They blend and compliment each other so well.  All are strong in their own range, and when you put them together,they are ear candy.  Buy this album, you won't be disappointed.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|this is a great book! I recommend this book for batman fans. It is very awesome! Get it now. Awesome
B004VMUS9G|5.0|We're travelling out of the country where we won't have use of our smartphone.  The clock will work well on our Kindle.  It was simple to setup and there are options for a variety of settings.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use on all devices. Keeps all my ideas and info handy at all times.<br />Install and store everything you need to recall and live happily ever after.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I think this is one of the best scifi shows ever created!  I love the entire cast!  Character development and plot are outstanding all the way through the show.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I saw this movie when it came out at the movies. I didn't know it was available on Amazon Prime but boy was I excited when I saw it. It's nice to watch movies in the comfort of your own home where people aren't coughing or talking in the middle of it. The Amazon Prime HD version of this was fantastic. It never skipped or paused to buffer, it was pretty smooth the entire time.<br /><br />The only thing I wish Amazon Prime would add is Subtitles to the movies and tv series they provide. Sometimes those subtitles make a difference.<br /><br />Overall loving Amazon Prime and I'm glad to be a part of it.
B008VBYN80|2.0|It requires you to purchase blue diamonds to do just about anything.  Other than that looks like it would be fun.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|This movie is not very good. The story line is just really dumb.The acting seemed like it was very hard for the actors to do their job.It may be they realized how poor the story line is and also the sound track was poor quality.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game works great on the Kindle fire and is very fun. No ads and has no out of pocket costs.
B008N1V11U|5.0|It was a.really good game it was awesome and it is 5 stars for sure it was just awesome awesome
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This game is free and ad free. Super fun way to waste some time. Works great on my Kindle fire.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I had already check the contents of the disc in her Youtube page. I still like to have the discs that I know I will like a lot of the songs.  I really like her music.
B001237AQ6|1.0|Exciter is post lead singer Gahan's drug addiction, and you can tell he is going through withdrawls here. Exciter is the least \\"Exciting\\" of their DM's large catalog.  Ther are 2 pretty good songs on here the rest is mush.  Dream On and Shine are good.  If you want to check out some of DM's latter work check out Ultra and Playing the Angel.  Those who actually like this album are either going through withdrawls from decent Depeche Mode tunes or much much worse!
B0042H6VY6|5.0|This collection has their hits. Great driving music. Wonderful memories of that period. Fond memories of Dusty Springfield. Wished there had been a discussion of the band.
B003KK65KG|5.0|I love Jodi Picoult and this was yet another of her master pieces. A great story and true to Picoults style the book ended with a wonderfully unexpected finish.
B007V65R54|5.0|I love this book, and I wish I could have written it. I heartily recommend it to anyone like me, whose tastes tend toward the &#34;how things work&#34; genre.I would also recommend it to any skeptic who doubts that a book about probability and statistics can be compelling. The author takes the problems and principles having to do with prediction and applies them to topics ranging from poker to baseball to the weather, to global warming, to international terrorism, and more. Anyone failing to find interest in one or more of these subjects should probably turn the TV back on. Maybe I'll try to make my next book as good as this one. Probability of success is slight, but it would be a fun challenge.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|Watch it many times and later shared it to my children and they liked the movie too.  I Thank you.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|I bought this because my girlfriend had never watched it.  It was fun watching the movie again for myself and she really enjoyed it and has become a big fan of Stitch now.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This was an Easter gift for my Grandson. He loves it. 3d is awesome. Beautiful colors lots of fun for kids.
B000BCE918|5.0|We already had the first Jurassic Park on vhs, but my kids love all 3 of these movies, so we decided to purchase this set. We are very pleased, keeps all 3 movies right together and easy to find in the cabinet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME it's just awesome!!!!!! I have Xbox version and it's a little bit better. I hope there is an update that has spawn eggs.
B009A87X80|5.0|A most beautiful voice...listen to over and over.  First heard her singing Fields of Gold and just couldn't  wait to hear.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|This product does not exist in the stores and is what my grandson wanted for his birthday so it was perfect.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|This album provides us fans with even more songs in their unmistakable signature style and performed in their usual superb manner.  Thanks, boys!
B000JMKNZQ|4.0|Very spiritual, I was not dissapointed. I woudl read anything he writes, it always makes you think. I am very satisfied.
B005IT0V8O|4.0|This book has a prominent place on my bookshelf, and now on my kindle. I miss E.B.White's delightful preface, but the basics are here and as timely as ever.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|The series is both comedic and serious, like life, I suppose. We find ordinary people and snooty would-be aristocrats, working people and the early days in the rise of the Great Middle Class. I am terminally weary of present civilisation with a cell phone in every palm and instant everything, so &#34;Lark Rise&#34; is just the place.<br /><br />Also, I'm somehow fascinated with life in the 18th & 19th centuries -- an earlier life, perhaps. Seeing people, warts and all, how they might have interacted, problem-solving without a PhD in the room. Hallelujah!
0374533571|1.0|Ugh! All one can say. Certainly, many of the 5-star reviews are plants. Perhaps the critics' reviews as well. This book is unreadable. No story development, no nuance. What an amazing marketing job his agent has done. Wow. I tried, I really did, to get through it and find out what all the hype was about. Especially since Matthew Quick was so harsh during his NPR interview after the interviewer called it a \\"debut\\" novel, to tell her it wasn't his first book, he's written several novels, and in fact published two others. (The book jacket calls it his debut, btw.) Waste. of time.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|If there are other versions available I would go with them. On no fewer than 30 occasions the word &#34;than&#34; is spelled &#34;that&#34; along with numerous other issues that should be caught before selling a book.<br /><br />That out of the way, I got this one for free and the book was great. I wll probably read the entire series as I am heavily invested in these characters.<br /><br />Truly epic book. Highly gratifying if not entirely shocking/original.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|what a great series! how could FOX cancel it so fast? what were they thinking?  I loved the cast. each one was absolutley terriffic in their role. the stories and direction were top notch as well as the sets and the music. I watched the  entire 14 episodes  in three sittings and was sorry to see it end. I'm not a sci-fi fan but I do like Nathan Fillion in Castle. if you like Nathan you will love this show.  buy it! you won't be sorry.
B002N2SYAG|5.0|Got the episode I wanted.  It was an old episode that could not be found online, so I ordered it.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Wonderful and puzzling thriller. Inside MI-6 or MI-5 maybe.He is a good writer and it is a very good read.
B004811PMO|5.0|Gordon Macrae is an iconic Curly. Shirley Jones in her first role was just right as Laurie. Never get tired of it.<br /><br />.
B003XT603Q|3.0|i think this is for the young--I am elderly.  He writes well and poetically but adolescents no longer interest me
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Managed to keep our interest up. Not bad for the &#34;future is gonna be bad&#34; genre. Josh Hutcherson was good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Quick and convenient way to keep an eye on the weather.  Was startled first time I saw red icons. Turned out to be warnings. Today I woke to a tornado warning.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|A well balanced cast did a great job moving the story along. Apparently based on the housing bubble fiasco, the story was taut and suspenseful.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I have full Internet and it wont download! its making me mad I paid money well I will have to libe
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|If you know about Lincoln from History you will find this to be a well acted but ho-hum and sometimes over dramatic portrayal of his involvement in the effort to pass the 13th amendment. I'm not going to mince words as there are a few interesting scenes, the cinematography was fine the acting was very good but the story itself was historically significant but theatrically forgettable. The side forays into brief glimpses of the Lincoln family and what turmoil they may have faced as result of being the first family during this tragic period in American History do little to redeem the lack luster script. Day's portrayal of Lincoln was beyond good but to me the most enjoyable character by far was Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. Other than these I found the entire film to be a bit windy and unmoving. It tried to move me... it just failed.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Les Miserables took me by total by surprise, I cried almost thrrough the whole movie yet I couldn't stop watching it.  It was so moving and for a musical I was totally shocked that there was such a strong story behind the music. The actors were wonderful and they sang beautifully. This is the first musical I have owned since I purchased Sound of Music which is not any comparison at all.  It still gives my shivers when I think of the movie and how strong it was to watch. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|No explanation needed for this show, it is awesome! I wish I could give this series more than five stars!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|learn the correct scoring techniques then use boiling water slowly. alternate under cold running water. then POP! its a lot of fun to turn 22oz beer bottles into glasses for everyday drinking. goose. sky. and morgan bottles are cool too. overall easy to use and delivers a better than expected end result. nothing a little emory paper can't fix. :P
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I am not one of those people who will tell you not to use or buy something, but I will give you a word if caution.  I opened up my Jorte app to check to see if a date was available and it reset just a if I were downloading it for the first time.  All my information is gone.  Guess I will have to go back to the google app with all its security breaches.
B00062PN6I|1.0|This product did not last 30 days.<br />Headphones fell apart.<br />No sound was heard , cord separated from connection.<br />Don't waste your money
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching season 3 on Amazon and am very happy with the quality of the streaming. This show is the bomb! All good shows must come to an end, but I hope it isn't any time soon.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|This CD is fantastic. Willie's guitar playing has never been better. He doesn't get enough credit for being a great guitarist. How he is still going strong at 80 is amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good and awesome game but should go to Tokyo because it would look really cool and beast.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app.  Helps me plan trips and travel.  Easy to use.  The app is accurate.  Use it every day.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|Nothing fancy, just what I wanted, a shell to protect my Kindle.<br />Bought it used and got a great deal.
1476733953|4.0|As a hopeful, self-publishing author myself, I must admit a degree of not jealousy, but healthy envy and respect for what Hugh has achieved. Hugh has achieved the unthinkable...he has managed to advertise in the middle of Times Square and have people notice.<br />Wool is not a great book, but it is very, very good. Many reviewers complain about the climbing of the staircase in the silo, that it takes up too much time and is boring and repetitive. But I think otherwise. I think the mundane climbing down and then back up the spiral staircase lends to the sad, ponderous lives that those in the silo live. Though I would have liked to know why, with all the mechanical marvels they had, they didn't have an elevator, but I pushed beyond that and let Hugh tell his story.<br />Yes, there are several questions that the reader has as they read through this book, but I have discovered, in my 40+ years of reading fiction, that if you constantly question the story, you miss out on the story itself. This is true for Stephen King, Dean Koontz and even the great John D. Macdonald. You have to let yourself go and allow the author to drown you in his or her web.<br />Let go and allow yourself to be pulled into their mind, into their story. Only then will you be immersed into the tale they want to weave about you. No, Hugh is not the second coming of Steven King, but he is a wonderfully imaginative writer, AND he caused me to lose a dozen or so hours of sleep at night. And isn't that what it's all about?<br />Wonderful book, a book I took great pleasure in losing myself in. As a hopeful self publisher myself, I can only hope to achieve what Hugh has. I wish you all the best Hugh, and I hope to follow in your footsteps.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I love fictional books, and I've read many of them. This is the best one, and it`s definitely the best book I have ever read. Read this book, and you won't regret it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I have seen the play and the movie.  They are both excellent in their own way.  I bought this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter.  We will enjoy seeing it over and over again!  The music is very powerful!
B009HUB40Y|5.0|I love this game but I cannot login to facebook it says Booty Quest is misconfigured for facebook!! please help!! other than that the game works perfectly :)
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved seeing this several times.  The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat even though you know the ending.  Well done!!
B0013KTGAG|4.0|I just blind bought this based upon other reviews that I'd read.  Afterwards, I'd read how some of the science behind the concept was flawed.  I'm okay with that.  I can practice suspension of disbelief, but only up to a point.  The point of no return comes in the third act, the one for which I read the most complaints.  I agree.  I won't tell you why because I would spoil it.<br /><br />But on the good side, they really tried to maintain a sense of realism with the crew and the mission itself.  (No hokey jokes.  No ridiculous romances.)  The fate of the human race rests with these people and they have their game faces on all the time.  I don't know what the budget was, but the visual effects were pretty good too.  Good cast too, including Rose Byrne, Michelle Yeoh, Cillian Murphy, and even Steve Rogers / Johnny Storm himself, Chris Evans.  I liked the person who played the captain as well, but I don't remember his name.<br /><br />I'm glad that I bought it, especially for such a great price.  I guarantee it will be watched many times.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I really loved this movie. It is very touching and I would recomend it. I felt like I really knew the characters, and I hated to see it end.
B001Q5395Q|3.0|I had heard of this 80's movie by reputation for a long time but never got around to watching it over the years. It seemed too kitschy to bother with, however I caved when I came across it on Amazon Prime as a free rental and decided to watch it. I'm glad I did but not because the movie has great production values, it's cheaply made and acted but has a certain charm in its cheesiness. The title says it all - a small town is the victim of an alien invasion. It has elements of 'Night of the Creeps' but even more over the top with its dark humor. If this is your kind of genre it's worth a look.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Gave it a chance because of a mention on a blog and I'm really glad I did. Would not at all be surprised to see a great writing career in Hugh's future.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Very disappointed with entire book. Ending was the biggest dissapointnent. Writer started strong but storyline became weak once into the second half of the book.
0060555661|5.0|I always wanted to read this book but could not due n number of constraints. Finally I got a chance to travel to US and bought here. It was a excellent read and useful too. we all make decisions but how many of those are actually correct and factually useful is something that we cannot findout. I 've found that concepts are clearly defined and the pitfalls [your ability to read the fineprints] is successfully stressed.<br /><br />Thanks
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Jack, Jr takes off where Dad left.  This is yet another great read from Clancy.  I really enjoy how all the characters have developed over all the novels.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I recommend it to everybody because it's very good and fun and also little kids can play. Try it. Thanks.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I love this movie so much!! this is a great mother-daughter movie, but is good for the whole family too. lots of humor while still focusing on how we all have to change for the people we love, and to not let little things get in our way as a working unit. I cried, so have tissues on hand, especially if you're watching it with your mother/daughter
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have been told it's a tear jerker , I just lost my dog, and I'm afraid I can't handle it right now.  I am looking forward to watching it when I am able, as I've been told it is a magnificent movie.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|screwing me out of gold coins. I wont buy any and I think its wrong how the game messes up at the end of a level and wont give you the coins.sucks
B007GE2H3G|5.0|The movie is full of action and mystery. A great story line to keep you on your seat waiting for the adventure to take turn and endless actions.
1933952806|5.0|Well written,good photos explains all you want to know about the Nikon d 7000.It details for a begineer the knowledge they need.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great.  The &#34;off brand&#34; one that I previously had pooped out on me all of a sudden.  Spent a little more this time and bought a &#34;good&#34; one.  Works great!  I guess you really do get what you pay for!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It had more potential. Sorry, not into doing these extensive reviews.  Don't mind the stars, its just all this that I find irritating.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Good fun but still has that pay to win feel. Cab be gotten around through some effort though.  I reccomend.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|My least favorite of all Stephanie's books.  Maybe it should have been called one day in the life of Bella.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Devoted sisters, sweet and stubborn romance, misadventures, traditional Christian morals. It's great for preteens and young women who love the classic stuff!
B0018QQQK8|3.0|Nice story idea - Predictable ending. Sorry, not into doing these extensive reviews.  Don't mind the stars, its just all this that I find irritating.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|My review is about telling how to spell things and the definitions of the word they look up<br /><br />My favorite part is when I get to right it and people get to learn
B003NX76BM|5.0|Loved this book, the characters, the depiction and understanding of dogs, the description of the training process, the characters and their relationship.  When Nora Roberts nails it she nails it well.  I  wanted more of this story, I found myself thinking of other potential situations for these characters.  A fun read, with great humor as well.
B000002UZ6|5.0|How can you go wrong with the one and only Diva Tina Turner! She is simply the best! :) Thank you!
B003G4W49C|5.0|A really great book!  If you loved the hunger games and are looking for a great read, definitely read this!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a Man, difficult but,fine. Can,t wait for the movie. Already recommended it to several people. Loved the entire story.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|One of the greatest musicals I have watched. The actors were outstanding and very talented. I really love Hugh Jackman. He is so talented!!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It's the best.  i love it!!  I have not regretted getting it to date.  I will not hesitate recommending it to my friends.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|The story told by the movie Searching for Sugarman is amazing, both about the artist and the societies worlds apart at the time.  The music played throughout the movie and we had to have it.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Interesting stuff. Too bad everything the author says is the spot on truth regarding the media in America. Worth buying
B001BKVWYG|5.0|See the movie and buy the music.  Both are enlightening.  Rodriquez has lived is life with total grace and his music had significant effect on the other side of the globe.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|There were times it was too easy, but was fun overall. Not really worth full price. Perhaps a price of $2 or maybe $3  but no more
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|The successful people are, as required by Hollywood edict, the villains; but still this film manages to set up a thought provoking conflict since the characters at all levels of the corporation are faced with &#34;damned if you do and damned if you don't&#34; choices.
B001AITGWE|5.0|I have seen this on TV (ugh) and loved it. Would love to own it. If it is ever available on DVD I would buy it in a heartbeat. Hope that happens....
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Quick and easy way to connect all your news, YouTube, TED talks, and social media sources, all in one place. Also, it is flexible and well constructed. iPad and iPhone versions sync with each other but are different in order to best utilize their device. Each is the best I've ever found for its platform.  Great program. Try it and you'll soon find it is hard to live without.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a fan of Nelson Demille, and have read most of his books. He has the ability to mantain tension constantly. You cannot put this book down! His character, John Correy, is a pain in the neck. With Correy there are only two options: you love him, or hate him. The Panther does nos have the extraodinary quality of Charm School, which is probably his best, but still it is a very, very entretaining book. JAS
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|*edit*  Keeping the original review below intact for reference. Since this initiatial review, I've discovered that if I restart the phone (then the game) that addresses the issue of some of the badges not displaying when they should).<br /><br />However, I still maintain that the difficulty level of the game (with regards to the requirements for badges which are required to move on to subsequent islands), is too high and ought to be lowered (admittedly, a subjective opinion).<br /><br />*/end edit*<br /><br />Played on my Samsung Galaxy S2. The game visuals, tutorial, and actual game play itself are all good. However, the bugs in the game prevent this game from being a legitimate contender in the genre IMO. Aside from the couple crashes I experienced (which I can deal with by exercising patience), the bugs that make the game unplayable are the star requirements that you cannot get (or at least, I cannot, on my phone), even though the requirements have been fulfilled. This is game breaking because they are REQUIRED in order to go to the next island.<br /><br /> There are 5 total awards for each map, each granting a start that accumulates then when you have enough, you can move to the next island. Bridge #5 is an example of how the game is broke. Outside of the awards for getting cars and trucks safely across, there are awards for 1) spending no more than $16K, 2) having a max of 50% tension w/ max $26k being spent, and 3) using wood only and spending $13k max.  I've fulfilled #1 and #3 successfully. It's an all wood bridge (no concrete for support, no cables, no metal), and trucks get across safely (with $12.9k). This should have pinged those awards to be awarded since the requirements were met...but it doesn't. Thus, those are 2 stars that cannot be awarded not due to player decisions, but game bugs.<br /><br />If these issues were fixed, I'd give it a higher rating, 4 (or 5 if we are rating the game only within its genre of physics games). But as it stands now, I don't see how anyone could legitimately give above a 1-2 star rating for the game.on't see how anyone could legitimately give above a 1-2 star rating for the game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was turned on to this series by co-workers.  It's one of my favorites now.  Would recommend it to anyone.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This buggy stroller organizer works wonderfully and can hold water bottles, cups, and etc. as well as keys, phone, wallet in the caddy. You can't beat the price either! I've tried a few other stroller organizers (JL Childress, and Munchkin) and this is definitely the best to use with our Maclaren strollers.
B008D30K7E|5.0|I of course downloaded this story because the title was a story in and of itself. I hoped against hope that the title wasn't a Gimmick and that the story would live up to it otherwise I would feel cheated. The story exceeded my wildest expectations. It was a master class in storytelling but more than that it had a huge heart.  First off the humour was deadpan and relied on absurd situations and it worked wonderfully.<br /><br />The tale of Allan wandering and getting into adventures was told in such a humane and yet dry way it was an absolute delight. Inspired with the story of the present the author tells the tale of Allan's life from childhood until the present and what a life! We discover Allan's blunderings and chance encounters have affected the entire course of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It was told in such a wise way.  Through Allan the author teaches us several lessons about simple humanity and that it is sometimes more important than politics or organised religion. This point is reinforced throughout the book. Prejudice, ignorance and bigotry are all tackled in a unique way. Allan is simply nice and calm but that is enough. Despite the many injustices done against him Allan only gets angry once and that is against a fox! This book offers so much to the reader it's difficult to do it justice without writing an essay. A great read worth every penny.
B009A87Z6U|4.0|Enjoyed the movie! I like Daniel Craig but he lacks some of the sex appeal of the prior Bond actors.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|omg ive been waiting forever for this game!!!its the best game ever. like seriously. its really creative and fun. I only wish that there were more levels for free! but I really recommend it to everyone, its only $1! yay. :)
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|A friend referred me to BSR and the more I listen to this CD the more I hit the repeat button.  Can't wait for their next release and, hopefully, some day seeing them in concert.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I can not beleive I got this for $47.99!  The Blu-Ray's alone are worth more than that!  The Box Set is beautiful!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Really, I can't praise this book enough. Even now, months after i've finished it, i'm still thinking about it. I have now shared it with my children who also appreciate the beauty and sadness within.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Took a couple of days for me to download but now that it's up and running I love it. Can't stop playing.
1878424319|5.0|This book changed my life. I don't believe in &#34;self help&#34; books so I was hesitant to read this, but reading it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. It has changed the way I look at the world and given me a huge sense of peace. The world would be a better place if everyone read this book!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Great game, worth it to try out the other characters.  Don't get too invested in one character, the game is more fun if you mix it up
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|it is a dvd....and it works...so I dont know what else to say about a DVD. it is what it is
B000BW7QX6|5.0|Loved the movie! I had already seen it but it is nice to have to watch whenever I want. If you have not seen this movie and you are a fan of the series Firefly it is a must have. If you have never seen Firefly you should and I highly suggest you purchase the series when you buy this movie. Sadly there was only 1 season of Firefly and Serenity does a nice job of finishing the story.
0385347774|2.0|Absurd rambling story starring characters who have no redeeming value that could have been told in less than 250 pages rather than 500+. Finished it just because I wanted to see how it turns out. Turns out it was a waste of time!
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Repetitive, tiring, obvious, bloated with filler, and, what is really odd, even the action seems dull! This one is for die hard fans of the Hobbit ONLY!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Love the movie always watched it on TV. Needed to have it. I love who plays in it. A must have.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|This book is truly the next best thing to watching Downton Abbey. It is like reliving the shows -- perhaps even better sometimes since Julian Fellowes has provided commentary (and this is not hard to use even with a Kindle) for so much of the script. I also have been able to study more of the English expressions. Reading Dame Maggie Smith's lines is fun (and one can just hear her voice!) Should be in any Downton Abbey fan's collection. Can't wait to read more scripts for the following seasons.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Such a puzzle with emotional suspense. Loved it and couldn't put it down.  Can't wait to read more about Harry, his daughter, and girlfriend.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|exceptional story and breath taking photography. Excellent achievement by the director. A must see movie but should be sen in 3D
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Try it you'll like it , fits for this game. Not just the same old match-3 game but keeps your interest, and you can build a little town in the trees. Nice music too. Different modes to play which keeps it fresh. Very easy and for all to enjoy.<br />Big fish games are really good game source.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great book for young and old. So glad I read the books before seeing the movie. Like so many book conversions, the movie would have been less enjoyable without knowing more of the characters' stories.
0307346617|3.0|NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. WAS AN O.K. READ BUT DID NOT THINK IT WAS GOING TO BE SO LAID BACK. WAS LOOKING FOR MORE ACTION TERROR ETC ETC.JUST SAW THE ADDS ON T.V. FOR THE UPCOMING MOVIE AND IT IS NOTHING ZERO ZIP NADA LIKE THE BOOK.NOT EVEN CLOSE.THEY TOOK THE STORY A WHOLE NEW WAY. TOO BAD.<br />GOD BLESS  SEMPER FI<br />JOE  FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a great book.  You get an inside look of Auggie and how people perceive him!  Great to share with a class.
B00005JKGK|4.0|as i stated i read the book first and then watched the movie and i gotta say i liked the movie more only because the book gave me the happy endings i didn't realize i wanted. in the books the daughters realized their sadness and do nothing to change it while in the movies they learn from their moms and find thier happiness because they know thats what thier moms want from them
B0000AK7AA|5.0|I purchased this for my granddaughter. She had been wanting to see the &#34;real&#34; casper. She loves this movie. So do we!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|i love twilight the books and movies and as soon as a read the third book i ordered the movie and i usually do not like books turned to movies but i liked this one as all the other twilight movies
B00B69UQJY|5.0|This probably one of my favorites in years. I love all the songs and it has a great upbeat to a lot of the tracks.<br />By far one of there best since Violator. I hope there next CD is very up tempo and keeps you going.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|i great ending to a decade of films, while the books will always be number one its nice that Hollywood did good by Harry, Thanks to Daniel, Emma, and Rupert who made the characters come alive for us all
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|This was outstanding in both picture quality and sound!!! I was concerned that it may not be what I expected but it really is Outstanding!!! There is one small minor issue.The picture colors are so fantastic with the beautiful clothes and fabric designs coming off the screen,that I found the entire picture had just a bit to much red color in the skin colors of the actors-but it was minor compared to the fantastic quality of this bluray film. It's that good!!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|sweet movie that shows kids not just the happy parts of growing up but the hard parts too, funny witty and ageless watched it as a kid and seeing as an adult made me love it all over again
B0076DELIG|5.0|As always, Avery good read.  Michael Connelly, is one of the best in the business.  I have been a fan for many years and will continue too buy and read his books in the years to come.  Thanks MC....
B001UV4XHY|5.0|the books were great and so were the movies while i will always love the books more i can't say the movies in my mind were lacking
B002M9WW30|1.0|ordered the above as advertised..recieved only half of order, and in poor condition. three discs in a beat up broken box scotch taped.  very poor contition and not worth the price !!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|the game, in arcade mode, would be a winner if not for the God like lightning which occurs randomly and ruins any strategy.  thus making the game at times more difficult.
B005LN5UOC|4.0|For the price it is hard to beat and it shipped super fast. The device is very easy to pair with the PS3 and works great while playing and talking. Only problem is I wish there was a left ear availability.
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|this show is about a pudgy bald guy and his 3 white trash buddies who supposedly rule over and intimidate all the gangs in LA.  We're expected to believe they NEVER get caught (until the end of the series), and the writing is just so lazy, as is the acting.  AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
B009HV2JT8|5.0|when I first heard the title I was like WHAT! If you are a history buff,then you will love it. It was really clever how they put the war and all other things in order. If you have never heard of the war, you'd be like...hmmm. I know that sounds dumb, but there are some people who don't know a thing about it! truth be told! It is one of my top fav movies. Like i said,i studied history, but hate to type.ha
B007B6VOG0|5.0|fun! is an apt name for this group, although the lyrics are often serious, the music just makes you want to get up and dance!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would have never picked this book put myself to read. A friend recommended it to me and I'm so glad. This series is the best and this book is my favorite of the three. So much action, romance, and even danger. Fantastic.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Very enjoyable and loved the new sound. I watched him sing on Jimmy Fallon and knew I wanted the cd.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Fast read! Get started! So glad I heard of this. I really hope it changes my health an  my life. Starting tomorrow!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I buy these several at a time because I love them, and they are hard to find in stores. They are lightweight and don't cover my ears (those kind get hot when working out, which is when I use mine). Great sound, and cheap!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Love watching it worth every penny.  It takes so many twists and turns, but easy to keep up with love it
B004VMUS9G|4.0|it wakes me up, and forces me to wake up to turn it off. it saves multiple alarms and lets me set my alarm schedule for the whole week. only thing missing? I would like different alarms, the ones it has are annoying after a while.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  One of the best movies of the 1980s, great and wonderful!  T
B00005UWMX|1.0|couldn't play it, just sitting on my shelf, too costly to ship back. no way to tell by label or listing it was wrong format
B006GHA9QQ|2.0|this show/Movie really destroys the first. This is way we don't make a second film after happy ever after. To follow the Phantom after everything that happens in Paris OK, but to take the show to where Webber did doesn't work. Destroys the ending of the first one and that fact you think all ends well for Christine and Raoul. I have no idea what Webber was thinking when he wrote this show.When I heard he was writing a new play for the phantom I was wanting to see it but after seeing this I was beyond disappointed with it and wishing that it was never written and I like both Sunset Blvd and Whistle down the wind, but this should have never been made in to a show on any stage. At least it was shot on stage like I wish they had done with Phantom so you get to see the true show as it is, doesn't save it in anyway but at least you get to see it as it should be. In the end Run and run far from this show if you like happy ever after because this movie is one reason a sequel should not be made.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Bar to see who's online is broken. It goes crazy and like 10 of them show up and they are blurry. Please fix... it really effects my rating and my facebook.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I keep going over this version of the show in my head. I fine it to be one of the best ones out there. I keep thinking about the casting and what the Dir was thinking, but he did put together and all star cast. at times I think the movie is in to high of a key, but that is what the actor can do.<br /><br /> I have seen and listened to many versions of the show and this is one of the best and what really makes it for me then anything else is that Colm Wilkinson the orginal Jean Valjean shows up playing the Bishop. I also know a show changes over the year so the missing and edited songs don't really bug me. this version of the show is one of the best out there and should be part of anyone's collection if you enjoy the movie or musical. To have fun well watching it think of Hugh Jackman  as wolverine and Russell Crowe as Maximus it will give a new meaning to a few scenes in the movie. Enjoy the film it is one of the best out there.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|This was a very readable explanation of a very complex topic. I think it gave a good explanation of physics and philosophy to date.
B005RZ8W94|5.0|I first heard a Volbeat song at a hockey game - Warriors Call. I would have bet it was Godsmack (an absolute favorite of mine!), but couldn't find it anywhere. I finally searched the web using some of the words from the song. Bought the CD and it hasn't been out of my player yet. At first, I wasn't sure about the song called Evelyn - i describe those songs as &#34;cookie monster rock&#34; - but it grew on me. Check them out, especially if you've been Godsmacked!
B000002AOD|5.0|To say the very least...Explosive!  I would love to hear Michel with full orchestra someday. Maybe team up with Vince Mendoza.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Update: 6/7/2013 Ive borrowed this from my dad to give it another go on my tv. My first review of 3 stars is flawed. In the theatre this movie was a 3 star in my opinion as there was just to much to process in one viewing. Now that i have it at home (borrowed) i may have to consider buying it. There is just so much happening in this film i wish they could have figured out a way to tell this story with some better details and it not feeling so rushed after a hour into it. I would have liked more of a back story on the dwarves and let us get to know them a bit better. Same thing with the 5 wizards.  This is a good movie although it has flaws, im growing to like it alot more. One thing that LOTR has over this is the pace'ing or FLOW, thats right, Flow, it goes at a nice even pace from start to finish and through all three movies, i feel the \\"flow\\" of the Hobbit is all over the place. I dont suppose its a bad thing, its just not what were used to in these middle earth movies. Ive been breaking this movie into sections and watching 30 minutes to a hour each day, it makes it easier to digest and i feel like i can process what im seeing a little better  (like i have the rest of the day to chew on what ive just watched) and WOW, doing it this way there are just all kinds of details jumping out all over the place at me that i didnt get at the theatre.  This is a good movie, just take your time with it.<br /><br />**Spoiler alert** the first hour is dwarves taking over bilbos place and singing alot.. the next two hours felt kinda rushed, I just watched this movie and i swear i cant remember half of it.. thats how unimpressed i was.. I liked going back to middle earth and im a huge LOTR fan, Ive never read this book and im afraid to now considering many are saying this movie stinks by comparison. Im going to have to re-watch this again before part two comes out as im going to be lost otherwise.  Fellowship was deffinately a better start to a trilogy than this.
1400069807|5.0|In today's day it's pretty safe to bet that most of us stopped blindly believing that the government would allow us to consume \\"foods\\" if they were harmful. Even now despite the laws requiring nutrition facts & an ingredients panel, companies hardly give full disclosure as to just what they are putting in these so called foods.<br /><br />There are plenty of people who have the opinion that we need to just stop buying these harmful \\"foods\\".  Yes, that is true but manufactures deceptively market their products to give the unsuspecting consumer a false sense of security that the food is healthy.  Example: A yogurt bar.  Better than a candy bar right?  Yet it contains more sugar than a candy bar!  Health food it is not.<br /><br />We all know we shouldn't eat a bunch of cookies, candy & chips.  But do we really understand fully the why of it besides the vague it's not healthy?  Michael Moss helps bring light to this confusion. The food giants did hook us.  They did it to make money.  They want us to buy their products & in order to get us to do so, they make addictive foods.  Calling their customers \\"users\\" aka addicts.<br /><br />Vote with your money & you will see change.  Nothing speaks louder than how we spend our money, so spend wisely! I sincerely hope you read this book & that it motivates you to make positive changes for a happy healthy life.<br /><br />Besides Salt Sugar Fat, I also highly recommend 'Super Size Me', 'King Korn', 'Food Inc.', & 'Seeds Of Deception'.
B0041KVX1K|5.0|Perfect condition. As a green Beatles fan it's great to have this for your collection. My favorite song has to be \\"do you want to know a secret\\"!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|One of my favorite holiday movies of all time. I watch this movie every year. Jude Law is a stunner! Great collection of movie stars.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These book is a good story about the love and loss .<br />I would recommend it to readers of all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! especially being able to both care for and show beauty. I just wish it was easier to get new tack and riding clothes ...
B001I9WK14|5.0|I never get tired of this movie. The music is so powerful and engaging, and it's so well shot, too.
B008XG1X18|5.0|awesome way to get anything from  decorating ideas to photos and even fun things for kids!!<br />I like how you can find anything you are looking for. Give it a try . You will love it!
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|The Blue Ray  was very sharp and clear. The movie was slow, tedious and boring. I've read the books several times and although the movie followed the books well, it was just too slow.  Making &#34;The Hobbit&#34; book into three movies is nothing but a ploy to make money.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Having seen this in the movie theater when first released, I thought this film would not have been as enjoyable or entertaining on seeing it again, but it was very entertaining. Both an homage to and a parody of classic western films where the hero sets out on a journey of self-redemption and has to create his own legend  in order to survive, this film manages to show the folly, foibles and ultimate downside risks of pretending to be something one is not. Yet the hero perseveres and ultimately uses his wits and swallows his own insecurities to succeed. Excellent story, dialog, writing, character development and animation.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|i absolutley loved this whole trilogy also the story behind it was a good one i found it very hard to put the book down.
B0091REZMW|2.0|game is not free as stated. hidden objects are the same just in slightly different spot. don't waste your time.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I enjoy the language and sense of humor but found the plot boring and the pace slow. Stick with Harry Potter.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This is a very dull and boring game. I played it for a few seconds and was tired of it immediately.<br /><br />They place a piece of the puzzle in the box and then you have to find a puzzle to match...BORING and DULL<br /><br />Not the type of puzzle game that would cause you to want to play more.
B0039HR5QS|5.0|One of Redford best work. Slow movies not like current action movies but still very interesting plot Good for a revisit.
B0063M22QO|3.0|This Mahjong game is not the real Mahjong Game played by Mahjong lovers once a week. All you do is match the tiles to get them removed one by one.<br /><br />The game is not bad. I takes a bit of thought finding the two tiles that would match and leave the table.<br /><br />It is a good time filler while waiting at the doctors office or just bored. There are  a few Mahjong games to pick from. Try them out before you buy to find the one you enjoy playing the most.<br /><br />Note: This has nothing to do with the real Mahjong game. This game only match two alike tiles.<br /><br />It can fill the time while waiting.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I chose this rating because I still cant get it to work, I connect it to the mp3 player, and nothing happens when I press play on the tape player
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Worst ending ever because coin got to live the characters peers and Kat did nothing but watch it all go down good book bad ending.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|It is a great entertaining musical. My teenager son loves it! He walks around the house singing the songs. Johnny Depp's versatility as an actor is amazing to watch.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|HL STATES:<br />THAT WHILE HE WAS EATING THE PORTION OF THE HUMAN ANATOMY, OMG LMAO, HE ACCIDENTLY SAW THIS PROGRAM. ACCORDING TO A WRITER FROM TATTLTALE, HE SAID I WILL EAT CATCH YOU LATER. WATCHED IT AND IS NOW THE REAL CONSULTANT ON THIS SERIES
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is a sweet, fun and sad story. Like others I dreaded the parts about the orphanage....how can such cruelty be inflicted on children?  Other parts made me laugh aloud. I found myself rooting for Jamie and \\"Lydeea\\". I recommend this book.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love the game and can't stop playing it . I say one more round but I am still saying that thirty minutes later. it is both interesting and challenging.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I absolutely love Persona 4, I play it non stop. Persona is one of those hidden gems that barely anyone knows about. I'm glad that this is so much different than Call of Duty because I was getting tired of seeing commercials for it. It's one of those games that has a great story, characters and multiple endings. Oh, I forgot to include AN AWESOME SOUNDTRACK, the music is incredible it goes with Persona 3, its so catchy. I recommend it for anyone who missed out on this on its ps2 day and who owns a vita. Its a must buy for any gamer. I am thou and Thou art I... get it now.
0446547603|5.0|I really loved this book.  I bought it for my teen granddaughter after I read it.  At times I wondered why in the world she stayed so long, hoewver, having lived this this, I know that the fear drives a person.  The book was true to life in so many ways.  It kept my interest.  It was very difficult to put down.  I hope the movie doesn't ruin it.  The last song was ruined by the movie. Didn't even seem like the same book. So much was left out of it that it changed the story.  The leading girl was just a bomb in the movie.  Please, don't take the brilance of this write away by always cutting really important stuff that changes the story.  This book is wonderful and I hope the movie will be as well.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is a great strategy/fantasy title. I have been waiting for a title like this since i got my fire hd for xmas. The tutorials are great and get you into the action quickly. The card purchasing system can be a grind, but it doesn't FORCE you into making card purchases with your REAL money. Multiplayer can be brutal, since many of the players have been buying cards with real money, but the game does match you up by level, so you have a shot at winning one of their cards. Overall this game is fun and fantastic. It has incredible graphics with imaginative card art.  Easily the best card/strategy game on the kindle.  Now all we need is a port of Culdcept and I'll be a happy camper!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|this is a good puzzle game. not great but worth your time. nice graphics. looking forward to more apps to come.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Well, my daughter has lost over 80 pounds on Atkins, so I thought I would give it a try.  The book explains the diet well, giving options for accelerated, as well as slower weight loss and the book itself is very encouraging.  I would recommend using the Atkins.com (free) tool with the book.
B003DZX3SA|3.0|It's a DVD & it worked & my daughter loves this movie so I don't know what more to say about that - it arrived quickly - but I believe it was rather expensive for having been out for quite awhile.
B0065CCM76|5.0|I just went to see him in concert and really wanted to have all of these songs.  I'm very happy with this collection.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I've always been a fan of John Mayer and seeing him in this concert is spectacular! You really get a sense of his amazing talent as he plays three different sets. I'm fan of pretty much anything by him, but for those who maybe like the pop more than the acoustic or the trio more than the pop, there is plenty in every one of his sets to enjoy. If you're a BIG fan, definitely buy! But if you're only a casual listener of his music from what you hear on the radio or any other place, then you may want to think about it. He tends to lengthen his songs to add extra bits of guitar playing that are clearly not in the original recordings or radio versions of his songs...and what's more, not all the songs he plays are songs that are played by popular radio, so don't expect the same versions of what you've heard.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I don't know what it is about this game, but I end up wasting hours at a time on this game. Lots of fun.
B00004SAAX|5.0|I bought this item for a gift for my daughter-in-law.  It arrived in good condition.  I was happy to please her.  She loved it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I first played this game on my boyfriend's iPhone and I blame him for making me become addicted to this game. Overall, this game is really really fun!!! Recommend!!!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|i found little evidence of this being a bad idea with a 24\\" monitor so i gave it a go.  i reinforced the clamp point with a slab of wood to distribute the force across the board, but other than that there's no noticeable issues with the clamping and the particle board.<br /><br />the arm itself kinda sucks at the pivot points if you are to be swinging it about a lot, though, as this will essentially loosen the bolts in my experience.  the tilting motion on the end arm kind of clicks into place and seems designed to be in line with the pivoting stuff in that it was all probably designed to ideally set into a comfortable position then largely left alone.<br /><br />at this price point, i'm happy with the purchase.
B00947N6D8|5.0|Kids liked the story so much, they demanded to get the books this movie came from.  I like that in a movie
B009YU6FJM|5.0|It has been a long time since an album this good has come out.  Solid all the way though, in true deftones fashion. Rip Chi
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was as good as the first book. I Can't wait to see what will happen in the next book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Quick read and full of Coreyisms. Very enjoyable reading like mold of DeMille's books. I am a big fan of his works
B00BF11STU|1.0|Showing the  Fanatics<br />how to abstract Intel is not<br />a Place for a Movie, such things<br /> should be left in the Dark.<br />Showing these tactics only creates<br />more Hate towards Americans<br />around the  World !
0385344228|3.0|slow, slow but a pick up finally kept me going.<br />book club liked it but no rave reviews by anyone.
B001MSMUH0|5.0|I read this book after reading a review by a blogger that I enjoy and admire. It was exactly what I needed to reassess what I do and why I do it. It also gave me a fresh perspective on things/gifts to appreciate and foster in my young daughter.
0345525558|5.0|Bookclub read this and we (18 women) agreed it was the BEST of the past 6 months!  Well written, great character development....rich story! Now for a sequel....
B006T5C5PS|4.0|I read this book after watching the documentary on Dr. Gerson and his daughter. It has some pretty convincing scientific data for why this approach to life and healing can be so restorative.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Very enlightening book with real world examples of problems and solutions. I really learned a lot about myself and my partner.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I highly recommend this book and have suggested it as reading for my book club.  Kept my interest from beginning to end.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|The weather info conflicts with actual measurements. The temps and wind speed were off a lot since I knew the actual numbers. Maybe they need to get another source.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|good thinking game.  It is great for all ages to understand and play.  I enjoy the bright colors and easy to view screen.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The story starts a little slow it seems but it's the groundwork for the whole novel.  The author weaves an intricate web and then finally leaves the reader with the choice of which of the 2 stories is the real one. There are many levels of the story and all of them should cause the reader to consider the complexity of life.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|A terrific movie. A bit long but so packed with action I didn't notice. Another indication of how good it was is the fact the sub titles took nothing away from the movie. Thoroughly enjoyed it....twice. A friend of mine who was in our nuclear subs found it extremely realistic and engaging.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read. This book has your imagination rolling non-stop since the first page. A real page turner and cliff hanger.
B00BYH6OJO|5.0|Great movie with a great plot. Mark Whalberg blew it out of the water. And Russell Crow you will love to hate!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Boring<br />S vs bfxnv it n hospitals has so I am infusing web oz rip Tzu remix zip hub oz oil oz zip ox chi bc
B009UZLRJE|5.0|This was such a good price for 5 seasons of The Big Bang theory that I had to buy it. It arrived very quickly, and the packaging was in great shape. All of the discs are blu ray, and the video quality is excellent. This set is well worth it if you're a fan of the show!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|this absolutely by far is a great hos game even if it says free...it is free till a certain point and then you gave to pay to complete. its got a great storyline and lots of hidden object games within. also there is bonus content to play as well but that's a short version. I give this game two thumbs up!!!!!!!!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|A friend showed me her Crystalize video on Youtube and I was hooked. Never really listened to violin lead music before. Primarily I listen to metal and hard rock (although I am growing tired of the screaming). I really like her approach and sound! I can put this CD on repeat and listen to it all day! Really looking forward to her releasing another CD. If you haven't heard her before, buy this CD. You will NOT be disappointed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode keeps me engrossed and on the edge of my seat. Multiple stories intertwined in each episode have made this season more interesting to watch. Keep them coming...can't wait for Season 4!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Anything Daniel Craig is in, I love. The 007 movies have come a long way since &#34;From Russia With Love&#34;, much, much better films.
B00AQNOCZ0|5.0|The box set said no region so I was kind of worried that it wouldn't play on my Blu ray player but it did perfectly. It's pretty awesome too that the first film is called \\"the philosophers stone\\" cause the US version would have read \\"the sorcerers stone\\".
B009SJ3H8Q|4.0|Jessica Lange is brilliant! Fun plot twists. Zachary Quinto is a delight-so weird. And James Cromwell is great. Loved the juke box musical number!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play every day and find it fun and addictive.  It's a nice change from Klondike and a diversion one will enjoy!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I don't like that you have to go to facebook to get some of the stuff or further in the game!  I have facebook, but my husband doesn't and he can't get further or buy some of the items without going through facebook! :(<br />So I don't like that part of the game!!!!!!!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I came across book as a suggestion on amazon - I couldn't put it down. It was amazing and I felt so apart of the story that I was sad to see it end. If you want to read a well written book that touches your core than this book is for you.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|Elizabeth Taylor gives viewers a class &#34;A&#34; performance in this dark classic film. &#34;Sure, I wear the pants in this family, someone's got to.&#34;
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game so much I mean really I still whatch my little pony with my little sis love it so much
B0006HBZXS|5.0|Seen this movie once before and didn't pick it up when I seen it. Great thriller and you find yourself at the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Great movie.
B008B68J2G|5.0|The Monster High collection has emerged from the toy world as THE horror lovers collector set. This little outdoor cafe is no different. The Scaris Cafe' cart and dining set is so cute, I dare anyone not to like it. Made from sturdy plastic and with such intricate details, you'd think it was made for adults, not children.<br /><br />The feel of the Scaris collection is whimsical and fun like Beetlejuice or the older Scooby Doo cartoons and Mattel goes all out on the design. Every inch of the cart and the furniture is made in such a way that you can be looking at them for hours and still find something new... and hidden spiderweb or bat or skull that you hadn't noticed before.<br /><br />This set has accessories galore. Tons of little sweets and treats and glasses, all detailed just as intricately as the cart itself. On the back side of the cart, there is a place for storage and the cart rolls very smoothly. The table and chairs are stable for the dolls to sit on and the coffee machine and display case are removable so you can mix and match with other Scaris toys. Besides the detail on the treats, my favorite part of this set is the little skull baubles they include for the umbrella. They are made of a sort of yellow fluorescent material so they almost glow like a string of lights would on a cafe umbrella in Paris at night.<br /><br />Very well made, well thought out set. I wish they had this sort of thing when I was a kid!
B00947N6D8|5.0|A great movie for all ages. I am glad I purchased it before Easter. My boys watch it over and over again.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|In the beginning of my second year of graduate school for my masters in English, I began to burn out. My mother bought me a kindle as a birthday gift and this was the first book I bought. It was immediately impossible to put down, it's magical, cinematic and mysterious... the imagery is completely consuming. In a time in my life when reading had become a chore this book reminded me of what I Love about books and the power the have to restore and renew. Five Stars!
B00A83075M|5.0|Great movie for all ages. The movie brings back all of the old game characters, my family loved it. Funny.
B004I744AS|5.0|easy and fun to use.  It is helpful and entertaining as well. Love the speaker feature that is also offered in numerous languages.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|This show is really great! Not sure if older people will enjoy it but if you're in the 18-35 range def try it.
B000BNX4MC|4.0|Bought it for the various highlights of Chicago and surrounding areas.  Good reminiscing of the Chicago I remember, not what it is now.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book! Leaves little to the imagination, but much to contemplate. Can't wait to read the next one! I'm on it!
B00000F566|5.0|Love the dancing!  Even the story line is a classic.  The music is from my era and brings back tons of memories.
145210655X|5.0|GREAT idea!  GREAT GIFT! Thank you for prompt delivery and this book is for an adult nephew, who LOVES Star Wars that had 2 sons within a year and PERFECT for story time!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Not only is this book an amazing love story but its a story that shows the power of change, and the progress that cab be made in life by finding love. I recommend this to anyone who loves stories about overcoming negative times in life.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I never watched this show when on tv. But watching it online has been great. Smart, fast paced, interesting dilemmas and swell court cases. I'm glad I finally decided to take a look. Watched first 3 seasons in a month and felt it was quite well put together. I'm ready for season 4.
B007V65R54|4.0|Silver delves into complex subjects like poker, weather, financial markets, and baseball to explain some important statistical and analytical concepts. My only complaint is that the subject areas are not always interesting and Silver's descriptions can be a bit confusing.  I found sections on subjects about which I knew something in advance (e.g., baseball and finance) to be easier to follow.
B00881VLCE|1.0|This game is not fun nor is it difficult to play. Gets boring. Not worth the money that it costs.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is one of the best Radio apps because it has stations that are not owned by Clear Channel who owns i Heart radio. It also lists i Heart radio station also but the links to those stations are hit and miss. To listen to those stations I recommend  getting the i Heart radio app. For all other radio station in the USA and around the world I suggest  getting &#34;tune in&#34; radio app.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Not really very engaging. I found the technical aspects of camera angle, high contrast black and white, snippets of conversation to be a little more than I could handle.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love it. I love how they use the figurative language and how it's really funny to read<br /> Love it.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|This is a perfect movie for a night in with a friend. It's cute yet moving and will leave you craving chocolate, so my advice is but chocolate beforehand.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This was a great movie in the theater, helps absorb you in the atmosphere...watch at home on big screen in dark & undisturbed.  This was my favorite Broadway musical, and I was skeptical about the movie but pleasantly surprised.  The actors/actresses &#34;acted&#34; the scenes, didn't just sing them, and they did a great job with the storyline that was more vague on Broadway due to scene transitions.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|I doubt if I'll ever use the chronograph part of the watch but I always wanted one.  It's not as big as I hoped it would be but still looks good.  I have small wrists anyway but I like the large face watches.  I now own six Invictas so far, of course I would recommend. This watch.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator all the time. I like the fact that it's so easy to use. It's perfect for everyday use.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love being able to read anywhere..dark or very bright, I had NO problems.THUMBS UP..Thank you<br />I will be getting more books soon....
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Wasn't very impressed with \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\", maybe it was all the hype about it's \\"kinkiness\\" and taboo subject matter. Of course, I don't see the scandal in being beaten in a sexual manner, but I digress. I enjoyed the first book once I viewed it as standard romantic fiction which spurred my interest in the second book. Must admit, this was much more engrossing and I ended up reading this well into 2 AM, as I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading the last piece of the puzzle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can build what ever I want but they should release the new update for minecraft pocket edition it will pretty much be like the computer version that is why they should release the update for minecraft pocket edition for the kindle fire hd
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I have read a great many books about the Second World War - almost all from the American or British point of view.  The story of the conflict from the point of view of a German air ace adds substantially to the breadth of my understanding of the war.  Wonderfully researched and well told!
B009X01D9U|4.0|the landscape is ok because it holds it's self up but unless I'm doing something wrong it's hard to handle on portrait
0679805273|5.0|Fabulous book for kids of all ages through adults.  Buying it for my teenage niece and I think it's going to be a hit.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love having the entire season to re-watch over and over again.  Would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original Superman movies!
B003730LRY|1.0|This is nothing like the Addams Family that we grew up watching.  From the very beginning, the sexual innuendos were in your face.  The kids were completely bored, thank goodness.  We watched the first 6 minutes and turned it off.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|kids love it on kindle....hubby loves it on phone...everyone wins! wish there were checkpoints instead of having to start over or use a gem...but other than that no complaints
B00AFEY354|5.0|I kept hearing a woman I work with raving about this movie, and I have watched it over 10 times this month alone!  Wow!  This should have won an award!!
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Its kinda like the author has a few ideas that he has to spread further and further apart as he realizes he doesn't know where the end zone is, so you start getting detailed descriptions of what people are wearing and elephants scratching their butts etc....there are still some good things going on and I still enjoy it, mainly,,,, but I've started jumping paragraphs of nonsense about clothes and ancient people's stories that have little to no relevance to the story....in my field (music), in order to start a recording, you should have some idea of where you want to end up....even if you wander, it gives you some plan, I think he's lost his plan.<br /><br />UPDATE  4/30/13<br />I've finished the book, and I feel that I was sold Kung Pao that turned out to be plain white rice, not interesting, nutritional, or imaginative. His publishers must have leaned on him to push this out because of the series, he must have known he had nothing to add to this.<br /><br />NOTHING HAPPENS!! My above review was kind in retrospect, I couldn't have imagined that literally NOTHING happens....I got surprised exactly once, and everyone that reads this review knows what I mean, because that jolt is the inky thing you probably remember about this book.<br /><br />I'm off this writer, shame for bowing to the corporate dogs, they probably leaned on him because of the show, but quality knows quality and it should know that you're either feeling it or you're not, and when you don't, then don't compromise. Remember that without YOU making the decision to edit yourself as to whether or not to put pen to paper, they have NO BUSINESS!! None!!!<br /><br />I'm pissed.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|They did a great job of following the book and the special effects look sweet.  I'm glad they split the story up into 3 parts.  Can't wait until the next chapter.

0062073486|5.0|what could possible be better ten a closeted killer locked up on a island isolated from the rest of the world with 12 guest being picked off one by one in the same order a an infamous nursery rhyme... thats right nothing. used as the blue print for the classic film clue, the book levels you on the edge of your seat from front to back. endless twist and turn lead to the cliffhanger to cliffhanger! PIck up a copy and give it a try you will not be displeased
B0090CVJZ4|1.0|Do not waste your time with these banana plugs. They may be perfectly functional but you may never find out. They do not come with directions and are not intuitive to use. If you value your time just buy [[ASIN:B006U3O566 Sewell Deadbolt Banana Plugs with Fast-Lock Technology, 12 Pair (24 Pieces)]] instead. It's worth the $6.
B004X8W4A4|5.0|Item: Book as described.<br />Delivery: Prompt and well packaged.<br />Recommend: Would recommend this Nikki Heat novel to anyone whose a fan of Castle!<br />Purchase again?: Yes, if I ever need another copy.<br /><br />I am a Castle fan, so I may be a bit biased. However, if it was a crap read, I would state it without hesitation.<br />Definitely for one for (but not restricted to) Castle fans!<br /><br />Overall Rating: A-
B008JGSM6G|5.0|We all love this game.  Good for adults and kids alike.  Challenging at times but yet simple enough for the kids too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. Once I got a little into the main part of the story, I could not put it down.
B000FA675C|5.0|Great writer, great story, great background<br />Made a lover of history out of me<br />You will enjoy his talent and word use
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was suspenseful and gets you right from the beginning. I enjoyed the story and liked learning the different English sayings.
B0097JYVAU|4.0|Finally got around to reading this book, and the overall impression is a good one. It is a mix of &#34;the story of Nate&#34; and a manifesto for probability rather than &#34;hard facts&#34; as predictions.<br /><br />Most of the chapters read as stand alone essays of prediction, data and models in a specific field - poker, earthquakes, weather etc. in a way reminiscent of Bill Bryson books.<br /><br />Behind and between it all is an attempt at highlighting the Bayesian &#34;worldview&#34; and general approach, which might make everything better. If it will in fact do it for you, depends largely on the field and type of predictions - and if you can test, measure, iterate every day or every second.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|While I am one of those introverts that can exhibit extroversion as needed, my son is not. This book has helped me understand more about myself and my children. I wish this book had been around when my children were much younger, my youngest is 16, so I may have been able to help them navigate the pressures of school better. We recently had to remove my son from public school and begin home schooling him because the school environment was overwhelming him. Now I understand better why this happened.  An excellent, thought provoking book, with tons of helpful ideas. I would recommend this book to anyone, introverts and extroverts alike.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|it was a diffrent Gregg Allman than i was used to hearing . the first time i listened i didn't like it . the more i listened to it,the better it sounded . had to listen to it several times to get hear what Gregg was trying to get across. i got it  and its great
0545265355|5.0|All books came in excellent shape, the box was actually wrapped in plastic and in a box with air bags for more protection. 100% recommended.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is the most fun I ever had on the kindle. If you want to pass the time away, and you like ponies I recommend this game. Sometimes it will lag but that not a big problem.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The unusual twist on classic fairly tales is a breath of fresh air in a world where we hear the same story over and over again.
B00B1ME3DQ|3.0|I'm a diehard Clutch fan, but this CD wasn't all that great. I've heard better from Clutch. I'm not disappointed I purchased this CD, but it wasn't the good old Clutch music i'm used to.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a great example of Faith and Belief in a higher power. A true example of strength and a will to survive.

B005HEUKHM|2.0|Star Trek Next Generation had some good episodes in its run. (Season Four, for example, had a number of tight, well written, well-directed and acted episodes.) But many of the episodes in season two were pretty dismal. Some were okay, but the bad ones were so bad, they almost sunk the series.<br /><br />For example, consider \\"Shades of Grey,\\" an episode in which Riker is bitten by a bug, then lies around for a few days in a coma remembering (dreaming) pointless vignettes from previous episodes. Deanna Troi and Doctor Polaski stand around his comatose body making weird cartoon-sad faces, and delivering truly horrific soap-opera-quality dialogue.<br /><br />I found this episode so appalling, stupid, poorly written, directed and acted, that I did a web search for online reviews to see how others felt about it. I found the following comments from the show's creators. Even the writers and producers were aware that it truly stunk. I had to edit them to take out the profanity, because there was so much of it in the quotes that Amazon deleted my first attempt at a review!<br /><br />'This episode is thought to be one of the weakest ever made. Maurice Hurley, who co-wrote the episode, commented, \\"Piece of s ***. It was supposed to be a bottle show. Terrible, just terrible, and a way to save some money. I was on the way out the door.\\" (Captains' Logs: The Unauthorized Complete Trek Voyages)'<br /><br />'In 2012, Peter Lauritson recalled the episode, saying \\"It was just... we learned from that. I think, probably the worst we ever did. It was like \\"Never again.\\" \\"Shades\\"... I don't even want to remember it.\\" Likewise, David Livingston also commented \\"It's very cheesy and the fans didn't like it.'<br /><br />'Ronald D. Moore called it \\"embarrassing\\". (AOL chat, 1997)'<br /><br />It's nice at least to read their comments admitting what a piece of garbage the episode was. God, it was awful. Uck.<br /><br />If you're looking for the \\"good\\" STNG episodes, start with season 3. And definitely get season 4. But skip this one. Some episodes, like \\"Shades,\\" are horrific.finitely get season 4. But skip this one. Some episodes, like \\"Shades,\\" are horrific.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Everyone has gone crazy over this film and the book.  Okay, it's a pretty good premise and I guess the acting was good.<br /><br />I don't see the big hoopla, though.<br /><br />I was raised on &#34;The Most Dangerous Game&#34; and also have seen this theme over and over.  It's pretty much just a teen love story wrapped up in a sci-fi thriller.<br /><br />Were we supposed to think of The Wizard of Oz with the costumes?  I thought more of A Clockwork Orange.<br /><br />I know this sounds like a bad review, but I'm only pointing out the parts I was not impressed with.<br /><br />The reason I give it three stars is Jennifer Lawrence.  The kid has made her debut in this film and she's going places.<br /><br />If you really want to see her in her glory, watch Silver Lining Playbook.<br /><br />This is okay to pass an afternoon in the rain.<br /><br />Meh.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Normally, I'm not the biggest fan of this author. However, I enjoyed this book and read it straight through. This one will not disappoint.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|cool game. needs more instructions on navigating. like most free games, you just have to learn as you go. wish could play off line due to playing on kindle, but still a fun game.<br /><br />thanks for the entertainment.<br /><br />cj
B00004XMTJ|5.0|If you love the music, whether or not you've seen the musical, you will love CATS. There is a major difference between the theater and the little screen, and it isn't what you might think--it's better. First, there are close-ups--the cat-faces, indeed the physical bodies and movement of the dancers, are breath-taking. Second, the performers are the best from various performances of CATS around the world--not only did they come together wonderfully, but they rendered the definitive presentation of one of the best musicals ever performed. Bravo!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie by far has been my favorite super hero movie EVEN for people who are not into these kind of movies love this one!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|Leonard Cohen is one of the best singer-songwriters ever. His gravally voice drives his rich lyrics right into your heart and soul. If that were all this album were, without the video, it would be great. But this DVD is more. The respect Cohen and his fellow musicians give one another and their joy creating the music, is wonderful to watch and adds so much to the experience. As his saxaphone player, Dino Soldo, says in one of the extra parts--they are &#34;in service to the music.&#34; WOW.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I personally am not a huge fan of comedies but this movie was GREAT!!! Will be buying this on DVD
B000FC10MU|5.0|This book is just so good! It gave me a whole new picture of America and I wish more people could see it like this.<br /><br />The gods will speak and tell you all about it. A classic Neil Gaiman book and in my opinion his masterpiece!<br /><br />If you know anything about some of the pantheons of the world I don't want to say too much cause for me it was the element of surprise that took me in and held me to the last page as if I was glued.<br /><br />My mother had to ask me to use both hands while eating and it was as if I was spellbound.<br /><br />As can be seen from my confusing review I absolutely love this book and I hope you will too.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|I have followed his career since I was a kid! I love his acting capabilities and the movies he has done!
B005N0C0JQ|5.0|I was hooked the first time I listened to it.  The heart and soul of Oasis conintues to deliver.  Easily on par with the best of his Oasis work,  In fact, I liked it better than the last Oasis CD, Dig Out Your Soul.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This movie was absolutely amazing in 3D. Great and realistic features! Perfect for any 3D TV (we have an active one). My boyfriend and I loved it!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Co-worker suggested this / Very thought provoking / supports what I had hoped is true / credible source / I'll most likely read it more tha once / I'll tell others about the book
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I loved the original Total Recall and this version in different ways! It was not a sequel but just the same concept expanded on and to bring new like for a new generation!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|The book moves at a fast clip, but Tina Fey always bring her A-game!  I have really enjoyed reading this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been watching this show from since it started airing!! This show is well acted and scripted!! Whether it goes with the comics or not with some of the episodes, I still like both in there own way!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is an amazing book! I have recommended this book to dozens of people. I've offered to buy it for strangers. Great concept and kept me turning the pages. You won't regret the purchase.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked that the love story was not the main topic after the first book. Well written and entertaining. A light read for anyone who wishes to end a trilogy in a couple of days
B006O2QNOU|5.0|Don't want to ruin it or give false expectations, but a fun exciting movie.  I'd recommend it if you're a movie buff, maybe not necessarily for a group of friends, but definitely a good watch!

1402720602|4.0|Not as complete as &#34;Guitarmaking&#34; by William Cumpiano, but has some great pictures, and information.  The book has proven valuable to me, especially for the price.  This gives the advantage of information stated, and pictures, in another way.  It also gave me a better idea about scale length, and the use of compensation, from a metric perspective.  More ideas to work with, and great pictures.  The Cumpiano book is still the go-to, but it can be laborious.
B00498TQV8|5.0|Jennifer is fantastic once again!!! Everything she is in is worth a look. Even &#34;The Bill Engvill? Show is my new favorite rerun!
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I'm by no means an expert on any of these devices. But after downloading and installing ES File Explorer, I discovered so much more functionality in my Kindle Fire HD that was not explained in any of the documentation. Access to the camera functions alone is worth taking a few minutes to install this program. Works just like windows file explorer. Easy to use. Maybe there is a downside here, but i haven't found it yet.
B009KWU6Q2|4.0|We sat down as a family and watched the movie. Every one enjoyed it. Robin Williams did a great job.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Just loved this novel. Absolute laugh out loud stuff. After many mishaps and hilarious adventures Don and Rosie make it!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|This is just an adorable movie. I completely love everything about it! The little girl venelope is too cute for words!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|i just bought a nikon d5100 and the camera fits in the case perfectly. what i loved about the case is that it came very fast and it is at a very reasonable price. looks just like described. seems very durable as well. i have been buying case logic as long as i can remember and never had a problem with them. the only thing is if you are looking to buy a case to store a lot of stuff (besides camera and the accessories) you are probably better off buying something else. but this one fits my camera sd card the lens and coupole more cords.

B002SRQ214|5.0|It's a Quad Core for under $100 what more could you want.<br /><br />For price to performance vs. the FX-4300 I went went with this Phenom II X4 965BE.  Since I was on a tight budget.  Maybe I'll upgrade to one of the newer FX 6 or 8 core processors in the future.<br />Just be sure that if you are going to upgrade in the future, don't skimp too much on the motherboard now.<br /><br />For Video encoding: I can't see much of a difference from my Athlon II x2 220. converting DVD to MP4 H.264 It may save a few mins but I usually start my encodes before I head to bed so who knows.<br /><br />For Gaming: Combined with an HD 7850 I can play Bioshock Infinite on Ultra @1080P .. Although it's a little jittery at times it's perfectly playable.  I usually just play on high or medium setting since I don't see much of a difference in Graphical quality. Maybe I'm too blind? Or maybe its my 32\\" Vizio HDTV?<br /><br />For Screen Recording: I recorded Bloons TD5 Deluxe (CPU intensive game)from round 83 to 88 just for this review actually. This beast only hit 62% load even while recording.  I have not been able to get good quality records with Bioshock though. It plays smooth while recording but there are tears in the screen.  And the finished video is choppy .. although that could be the fault of the recording program I'm using.(It doesn't seem to like windows aero effects and always wants to turn it off.)<br /><br />Just as a side note, I ran Prime95 for 1 hour. It hit 62 degrees Celsius (room temp was between 72 and 75 degree Fahrenheit the entire time)but the system didn't crash in that hour so that's good I suppose. It was my first time \\"stressing\\" a system for no apparent reason and can't say that I see the point in it. Just something I did for this review.<br /><br />Speaking of temps it seems to idle between 40-42 degrees Celsius with the stock heat sink and fan while doing things like surfing the web. I feel like it's running a little warm for there to be 0-10% load on it.<br /><br />Umm...

B008C20TDG|5.0|After years of feeling exhausted and basically surviving on Diet Soda and sugar, I decided that I'd read up on eating clean.  Whole 9/Whole 30 shares the basic information of their plan on their website, but I wanted to read further into the science, so I purchased this book.  I found it compelling, and it made a lot of sense.  I am almost three weeks into my 30 day clean eating program, and I haven't felt this good since high school.  I have two children aged 2 and 4, and they do not exhaust me as they did a few weeks ago.  I am hopeful of even more change.  I definitely recommend this book.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I loved this book! I liked it even more than the first, so if you were weary about the first the second is better. I cannot wait to read the next one either, love this series. Must read!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really addicting.Even more so than the original. I've lost my wife, kids, and job thanks to the countless hours lost to TR2. Also, drugs.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This was a free kindle and I know why.  If I could give it no stars I would.  Just a sample,  the heroine on page 2 or 3 is described as having green eyes, in the next chapter she has blue.  I mean really, if the author can't remember from one page to the next what her main character looks like, it's a sorry state of affairs.  Even free this mess is not worth it.  Oh, and btw, the murder isn't even on the Cote d'Azur LOL
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Enjoyed the book, the characters and the descriptions of the Seattle landscape. Have read book one and two. Will read book three.
B003JTHWPA|3.0|This is a beautifully written book in which not much happens. The droning interior monologue of a handful of characters is occasionally punctuated by some incredibly dramatic event which moves the &#34;plot&#34; forward. There is lots of walking around town thinking about things, with a feeble attempt at redemption in the last handful of paragraphs.<br /><br />I had to fight my way through this one, folks.

I have about 20 3d movies and this and 'the hobbit' (my last two 3d movie I've purchased is unwatchable in 3d). When there's a still picture, it looks fine but when you get movement, it was completely blurry and gave me a huge headache. This doesn't happen in any of my other 20 3d movies I own. Only the last two most recent purchase of 'life of pi' and 'the hobbit'.
B005HEE60E|5.0|Great show, a classic.  This is what SciFi should be, the writing is top notch, and the acting fits so well.

1400034205|5.0|\\"I have never begun a novel with more misgivings. If I call it an novel it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have a little story to tell and I end neither with a death nor a marriage...\\". Somerset Maugham is delightfully disingenuous in introducing his 1944 novel, his last great success; he knows exactly what he is doing. He remains present throughout as observer, catalyst, and occasional participant, shunting himself onto the sidelines, quite disclaiming the tight control he keeps on his material. Even at the end, he apologizes: \\"I looked back in my mind's eye on my long narrative to see if there was any way in which I could devise a more satisfactory ending.\\" And yet, he realizes, he has in fact \\"written nothing more nor less than a success story. For all the persons with whom I had been concerned got what they wanted.\\" Quickly, he lists them, and he is absolutely right: it is a perfect ending. But the values by which those individual lives are measured differ in every case, and that is what gives the book its profound moral significance: how should we judge the ends to which a life should aspire?<br /><br />Unusually for him, Maugham peoples his story mostly with American characters, even though he apologizes for not getting the voice quite right. I think he does this to have one pattern for worldly success ready made: the American pursuit of money. The novel opens in Chicago in 1919. Maugham, the author-narrator, visits an older friend Elliott Templeton, an aesthete and inveterate snob who has built a position in Europe as covert art dealer and social host. He introduces the writer to his sister and her daughter Isabel Bradley, a beauty of nineteen. She is engaged to marry Larry Darrell, a war hero recently returned from service as a fighter pilot. Larry has all sorts of positions open to him in the burgeoning world of Chicago finance, but has delayed a decision for so long that Isabel's family is getting worried. Begging for more time, he moves to Paris to find himself, and eventually the action shifts to Europe completely.<br /><br />Maugham treats the American characters with a touch of mostly-affectionate satire. He revels in baroque flamboyance with Elliott Templeton, and dissects Isabel Bradley with a fine mixture of admiration and venom, though he is perhaps a little ham-fisted in portraying Gray Maturin (her other suitor) as the epitome of an American businessman-jock. The single exception is Larry Darrell, whom he presents entirely straight. As the action moves in snapshots through the twenties through the Wall Street crash and gradual recovery, Larry drops in and out, going his own way, which takes him from a coal mine in Flanders to an ashram in India. It becomes clear that he is seeking some kind of goodness, some meaning to life, and eventually we suspect we are in the presence of a kind of saint. But Maugham does not make him entirely an ascetic. As Maugham presents a world increasingly marked by excess -- contrasting the social heights with the depths of sex, drink, and drugs -- Larry retains the ability to move easily in any environment, although he does not always succeed in his attempts to do good.<br /><br />THE RAZOR'S EDGE was a major success; perhaps Larry's search for meaning struck a chord with readers faced with the meaninglessness of war. This was the period when Maugham's younger contemporary Graham Greene was beginning his own series of books about spirituality and redemption, from [[ASIN:B004HMUPAW BRIGHTON ROCK]] in 1938 to [[ASIN:0142437980 THE END OF THE AFFAIR]] in 1951. But the extreme compression of the latter points to the one aspect that I find least satisfactory in Maugham's novel: that he could not seem to decide whether he was painting a fresco of high life or engraving a detailed portrait of the protagonist who rejects it. Yes, I can see the care with which the author has balanced his characters -- for instance having Elliott Templeton bank spiritual credit by building a church and furnishing it with antiquities as a favor to the Pope, while Larry mortifies himself by working in a coal mine -- but I would have preferred more concentration on spirituality than wealth.<br /><br />Finally, I have a personal reason for being drawn to this book. My father returned from WW1 also as a decorated hero, and he also (though less spectacularly) rejected the openings that his family expected of him. Instead, he too wandered the world in search for higher meaning, leading to a religious conversion some time in his thirties. This twenty-year period occurred, of course, before I was born. Perhaps because of his traumas, my father never spoke of it, and it remains a dark hole in my understanding of him. Maugham's novel goes far to shed some light.lding a church and furnishing it with antiquities as a favor to the Pope, while Larry mortifies himself by working in a coal mine -- but I would have preferred more concentration on spirituality than wealth.<br /><br />Finally, I have a personal reason for being drawn to this book.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I already have several dual port chargers for my car, and I bought them because they were cheap enough when on sale. But they were cheap for a reason. In retrospect, if you take away the criterion that it has to work, I could have paid even less. So this time I wanted to go for something with quality from a manufacturer whose products I already trust.<br /><br />It would seem as if getting five volts out of a 12 volt car battery would be simple enough. But most chargers simply don't supply enough current. They are often only 500mA, while this one gives you 3.6A. That's enough to actually charge an iPad, while with other chargers, you might be able to maintain (or charge very slowly) your battery level in your phone and possibly slow down how fast your iPad drains its battery. This device will charge as fast as Apple's wall charger.<br /><br />This has the appearance of a high quality product. It doesn't look like something thrown in as a device accessory. It lacks an LED, which the manufacturer thinks adds to the elegance. My initial thought was that I rely on the LED to know when the device is working. But it may be that I needed it because other power supplies/chargers didn't work reliably. Since the devices themselves let you know when they are charging, I should have no problem without the LED.<br /><br />This one costs more. But you get what you pay for. I've probably spent more on other chargers that ended up in the e-waste bin.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It's a fun long-term game. Definitely try and get a few friends to play, it will really improve your game experience.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Good game. Kills a couple minutes a day. I don't like that my character runs out of energy so fast cause it gives you very limited play time but still very fun to play and try to come up with medicine for your dying family!
B004FOA84A|3.0|I have The Lost City, and didn't know about The Secret of Grisly Manor, came across it thinking it would be as awesome as Lost City which I am stuck on  and can't complete, but its FUN and LONG, especially compared to TSGM, which once you solve it lasted only about 10 minutes, I thought when I found grandpa, and it said continue there would be more... but NO it just lets you start the game over, so as for kids its GREAT! for adults that love a longer challenge... not so great. I didn't hate it, but had I known I would not have paid for it, should def be a free game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Screen shots are great. Love the graphics. Sucks time like no tomorrow. A great game to play at anytime. I would highly recommend that you play.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I am traveling and need an alarm clock. My daughter said to check my kindle. The mountain music wake up was perfect.
B00B22IJXK|2.0|this app is pretty limited, with no choice of brushes (except different sizes) no layers and no undo. there are better photo editing apps out there and better drawing apps. i would not pay for this. was happy to try it out as FAOTD but now i'm going to delete it.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|Refreshing to see the money spent on the screen script instead of on the actors.<br /><br />Well written, well paced, good plots lines and character development.<br /><br />Lots of classic themes from Romeo and Juliet to Hamlet.<br /><br />Werewolf vs Vampire is an homage to all the &#34;vs&#34; movies and they pull the two together with decent plausibility.<br /><br />Overall I breathed a sigh of relief at the end that this movie is not tiresome or plodding.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This is another series I have bought in Blu-ray, like the Matrix. Certain works of Directors, Writers and screen writers and of course certain actors. If I have read a decent review of the Blu-ray mastering I will buy. This is one of my favorite series off movies or as stand alone. From the first time to the 50th time some don't get old. Thank's to everyone involved in this.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I had no idea when I purchased my droid that it came with this app already installed, and it is awesome! Once you sign into it, all the cds I purchased from amazon.com automatically uploaded to the app. It was an awesome surprise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a compelling book. I read it fast, all the time wishing it would last a long time, but couldn't make myself go slower.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It is so much fun to play. I love to compete with friends too. I give this game a definite thumbs up.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|This fifth installment in the Die Hard series is a blockbuster, a crackling piece of entertainment. This outing is a little different. It has a truly frenetic pace and the action seems non-stop to the point that it never takes a breath long enough for the plot to catch up with the on-screen heroics and mayhem. Yet, it all seems to work and Bruce Willis just seems to keep getting better with age in this role. I really find the negative reaction to this film perplexing. This is a good one and it is solid entertainment from start to finish.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great emotion came through in the singing, unlike most musicals.  Hugh Jackman should have won Best actor at the Oscars.
B001JNND9W|4.0|This movie had a lot of firsts for me, 1. At this time in history we mix in the helicopter, to my knowledge up until now it had been like is shown also the police pursuit by motorcylce or Patrol car. 2. The media production of a counter culture hero, the more he ran the more of a spectator sport it became. 3. The beating of the black disc jockey showed Racism was alive and well 4. This is a movie about a Police chase, not part of one like in Bullit or French Connection. 5. Having seen this when it opened in the theatres the crowd or audience emotions became as much as the story as the what was on the screen.<br />I would say for anyone who is a student of film should see this , this was no special effects but some great stunt people strutin there stuff. And part of the film industry looking to reinvent themselves in the coming of cable TV.<br />Last but not least it is a glimpse of life in this time period going from roads to super highways and the capturing bits of the diversity of culture during the period.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Oh my gosh I love this game, I am stuck in one part and can't seem to find any hints to get me through it, but its a great game if you like puzzles, def worth the money.

B005LAII4E|5.0|G.I. Joe: Retaliation is an all out fun film and definitely a more entertaining and well-made film than its predecessor. We really enjoyed this one. Needless to say, we all felt energized after seeing it. This is slam bang entertainment all the way. The cast is awesome and there is some really good crackling dialogue that keeps this action flick moving. Enjoy!

B003EYVXTQ|4.0|This is not my normal cup of java, but someone told me if I wanted to see Ms. Lawrence capture a role, this be a good start. I had seen her on DAVE and after 30 years of watching him,( think it was in middle of AWARD SHOW MONTHS), I was taken back by the respect he showed her.<br />I bought it on a sale or something @ Amazon  and it sat around for a while. So once upon a sleepless morn I put this on, I don't think 10 mins. into it and I realize that she had me. Not only for the length of this movie but for any project she gets into. This is an accurate portrayal of rural life in the US and like poverty in the cities from coast to coast it chews people up and shows the true inhumanity of poverty. You can substitute &#34;moonshine&#34; for meth or the other way, some years ago it was &#34;crack&#34; and poor blacks went to jail or died, this shows poor  whites.<br />I hope that as many people who can stand the truth see this movie, and are compelled to help others, for sure Jennifer Lawrence was &#34;all in&#34;. A dark movie on a dark subject , she carries the whole thing, thats my opinion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I choose to have this app cos is very helpful to grown my spiritual life with God and Jesus...I can read it and also listening to the bible verses and is very good not only for myself but for my family as well...<br />I really recommended it to anyone that needs a closer encounter with the words of the Lord God Almighty...<br />I just love it...And make me feel better reading it ....God Bless...

B0067R0APK|4.0|Love the new personalized weather ratings and the new graphs.  I would like to see more layers available on the radar screen.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I had this on release day order, for the most part great all the way around. He does &#34;classic&#34; pop tunes some new, and I so enjoyed it listened to it twice on release day. Great American Music by a Great American. This like something &#34;Gatemouth&#34; Brown did called &#34;American Music Texas Style&#34;, this style maybe is bigger then Texas. That old Martin has never sounded better.

B001XV3LSS|5.0|Add this movie to your collection. If you like space exploration then this is a good addition to NASA movies.
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown has never written a bad novel and I think I've read them all.  However, I appreciate this book the most because<br />it started a religious conversation about the beloved Mary Magdalene and her powerful relationship with Jesus. After all what is the big deal with Jesus being married and a great prophet and bringer of love and light at the same time. I think it is always a good thing to question what you've been taught, because this teaches you how to be a great thinker.  Of course the book has a thrilling plot and keeps you glued to the story.  You know you are enjoying a book when you don't want it to end and this has been  my experience with every Dan Brown novel that I've read.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is a very good item too have if you use plantronics pro you should have it.. Battery last for ever I tell you for ever lol.. It's awesome item I love it...

B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey and need a something to take your mind off it this is the book!  I have read the 1st and 2nd books to this series and I cannot wait for the 3rd book to come out.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Just as he did in the first book of the Century Trilogy (Word Without End - which I also highly recommend)  Ken Follett masterfully builds characters and informs without you even realizing it is being done.  He does a great job using point of view, particularly with the Russian/Soviet characters.  Suddenly, you just know these people.  And as the plots unfold, you live through World War II by way of their perspectives and feelings.  There is suspense in every conversation - love, relationships, and even political philosophy all become exhilarating.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I've tried it a little bit, but my granddaughter who's almost 7 loves it. My other granddaughter who's 4 hasn't quite figured it out yet and I think she's a little young yet but she keeps trying.

B0028IDXDS|4.0|We haven't used this yet, Im sure it will come in very handy with the new baby coming. My Daughter loves it.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|The best part is Melissa McCarthy and her outtakes at the end.<br /><br />But, her 5 minutes on screen is not worth watching it.  For free, it is a waste of time.
0316017930|5.0|This book is so great. I conducted a weekly reading group with it. People who read it are still talking about the genious of Malcolm Gladwell. My grand children read it in high school. A family friend read it in college. It is an award-winning book!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|As always a brilliant novel, can't wait for the follow up to it. hope it will come out soon too.

B001DM1VXE|1.0|Black and white and no story line.That is all I have on the subject but you need more words so therre
B0063M22QO|5.0|it is a game built on skill levels and is most challenging and entertaining. It can be addictive if  you let it.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|The operas I have heard have been good to outstanding. A surprise was the French Don Carlos which is about the best version I have heard or seen. The set is an excellent value and I look forward to further discoveries.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Slow download and install. on my kindle fire. Slow to load chapters when playing. That said the graphics are very good and play is smooth. Fast paced game that may not be appropriate for young children as the shark eats everything including people. The app name and avitar is a clue. So far I like the touch controller over the tilt. When I used the tilt I almost fell out of my chair. Do not go to the beach I may be there.
1600595871|3.0|Not quite what I was looking for but it is still a good book - I'm sure I will use it as reference
B0091Q82L8|4.0|An amazing performance, but not (as some have suggested) as good as Live At Leeds.  The songs here don't seem as &#34;put together&#34; as they do on &#34;Leeds&#34;.  The band seems a bit sloppy, but having said that I am very happy I own this concert recording and I'll listen to it repeatedly.<br /><br />Are you fan of this amazing band?  If your answer is yes then do yourself a favor and buy the Live at Hull show.
B0059XTUB8|3.0|During the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" (London 1956) Colin Clark - 3rd Assistant Director on the movie spent some private time with Marilyn Monroe. The book \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" is a very heartfelt & intimate journal in which Mr. Clark shares his personal memoir of that time. I am pleased to note that the movie follows his account quite accurately.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that as good as the actors may be when it comes to supreme icons such as Marilyn Monroe & Sir Laurence Olivier & Vivien Leigh it is just not likely to work.<br /><br />These icons had something that transcended physical looks, it came across from within, a spark, an intangible aura & regardless of how well an actor can act it is simply not possible to bring that same \\"It\\" factor to life. Charisma can't be `created', either you have it or you don't.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to say that Michelle Williams did not do a good job portraying Marilyn Monroe, I am sure she did the best she could, but Ms. Williams is no Marilyn Monroe. Kenneth Branagh, wonderful actor that he is, is no Olivier. Julia Ormond is a wonderful & beautiful actress but she is not Vivien Leigh & through no fault of her own it simply was not believable. Dame Judi Dench did a masterful job of portraying Dame Sybil Thorndike & Eddie Redmayne was very good as Colin Clark, other than that none of it felt true.<br /><br />I watched \\"The Price and the Showgirl\\" right after I read Colin Clark's book & that was a hundred times more enjoyable to me!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love it.  Can't wait to finish Season 1.  Hoping I'll soon be able to catch up to the current Season 4. Got a ways to go -- still have to watch Seasons 2 and 3.  Love that Amazon allows Prime Members to watch for free.  I sit at my computer and watch episode after episode.  Quality and sound is very good.  Thanks.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Entertaining, well researched great story.  Wonderful characters, descriptive and funny.  Laughed & cried. As an athlete could relate to the joy and collaboration in competition.
B000005AYL|2.0|Apparently this is an early release. It is missing Otherside of The Game, which happens to be one of my favorites from the debut. :(
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I have to admit I was expecting something more based on all the hype surrounding this picture but was not disappointed with what was delivered.  Was a bit surprised by how many big name celebrities populated the screen, some quite entertaining such as the character portrayed by James Spader.  Not really sure what the point of making this movie was, to be honest, except maybe a vehicle for making money off the Lincoln name.  If it was, it worked.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining and worth the view.  I recommend giving it a look if you haven't already.
0765325950|4.0|I know that after 13 books building a storyline, one book can't possibly make every reader/fan of The Wheel Of Time series happy.  Everyone will be invested enough in these characters, and have spent time daydreaming about how they might have resolved certain story lines, (I have issues with the Seanchan storyline) but none of that matters.<br /><br />The fact is this book is full of action on multiple fronts and as far as I can tell the important aspects of the story are coming to a conclusion in a very satisfying way.  As a result, I think that Mr. Sanderson has done an amazing job fleshing out Robert Jordan's notes and completing the massive story he began almost 20 years ago.  If you've read the others, read this one.  You'll be glad you did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my second time through this trilogy, and my opinion has not changed- this is the BEST book of the three. It grabs you from the start and never lets go. Superb work by a very talented author.
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|Most of what was covered in this movie was covered  in the &#34;Lord of the rings&#34; trilogy. Still very well done!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|If you are an avid reader AT ALL don't buy this book.  The writing is absolutely atrocious and repetitive.  I couldn't get through half of it.  Really lame.
B0012Z36X0|5.0|Excellent quality, excellent condition and it sounds amazing on vinyl. I am beyond satisfied! This album is def one that can be played over and over again.
B00BF11STU|2.0|With all the right wing propaganda the was forced down America's throat for eight years this movie is no surprise at all.  SPOLIER ALERT!! The movie validates the use of torture that America performed on foreign nationals and draws a clear line from that torture to locating and killing Osama bin Laden.  Very black and white.  The so-called doubt portrayed in the movie is shallow at best and seems to support the popular notion that American operatives have been literally making it up as they go along all along.<br /><br />Not to say that this is a bad movie but if this is how events ACTUALLY unfolded, I think that every American should sleep with one eye open from now on.<br /><br />Not all that entertaining.  Worth a viewing if you have three hours to kill.

1936891026|5.0|The book was exactly what i have been looking for in my business as well as personal life. I have read it already 3 times since i bought it one month ago.
B005DJREJS|4.0|I found this by accident and so happy I did.  This is a show that everyone can relate to in one way of another.  It was fun to look back at the high school experience.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|The story kind of drags but the ending makes the entire movie. Makes one want to believe, or wish. that his kind of integrity is in all pilots.
B001CDD84Y|5.0|Probably will buy this for our collection.  Pretty decent filming and story.  it is good entertainment and the price to watch was good.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is just as good as book one as far as the artistry of the storytelling goes.  It's a bit over 1,000 pages which is fine for me because I love big, good books.  It got bogged down in places, unlike the first book.  There seemed to be no reason given for Kvothe being sent after a group of bandits that were stealing the King's tax money.  That one of the Chandrian was the leader of the &#34;bandits&#34; was a surprise, but neither the Maer nor Kvothe could have known that was coming.<br />But we still don't know why this trilogy is called the Kingkiller Chronicles - no mention has been made of the King or why he might need to die.  We also still have no idea who Bast is (other than that he is an Elf), where Kvothe acquired him, or why.  Or what his true intent is.  The ending of this book would have us believing betrayal of the worst sort, but I don't think so.  I think Bast is trying to get Kvothe to react to something, anything to get him back to who he was rather than who he has chosen to be at this time.<br />A great story and I can't wait for Day 3, but there doesn't seem to be any indication of when that might occur.  Prolly a year from now when I will have read 10 other trilogies and will have forgotten 1/2 of what the story was about.
B00BD2DRHW|1.0|I thought this would be a neat app and it was until it locked up my Kindle Fire. It wouldn't reboot  or shut down for a long time.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Daniel Day Louis does it again, and the rest of the cast is also excellent. It isn't easy to make a movie about a political challenge, but they all do a fantastic job making Lincoln a human being who was human but mostly incredibly smart and courageous. The movie makes you want to sit and have dinner with the guy, and ask him to come back and infuse our current President with some much needed hutzpah.
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved the fact that they show the love a parent has for their children and what great lengths they will go to in order to keep them as safe as possible.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This is a great take on the Jack Frost story! I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it again and again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I enjoyed the second book, can't wait to read Mockingjay. I loved Hunger Games and was happy to hear it wasn't the end. I would recommend it to anyone who would ask if they should read it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It was nice enough that the calculator was free but it is a great addition to my Kindle Fire.  It works wonderfully and it so handy to have.  I thank you very much for the very nice gift.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway suffers is an awesome game, it helps improve your hand eye coordination. Also it is very fun to play and share with friends.
0061950726|3.0|This author made a factual error that immediately put me off. She has the family coming into Ellis Island in 1927.  Ellis Island closed in 1924. The present tense narration also put me off. If the old woman is telling the story, it should be past tense.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is a great game I love so of you people out there should try it. it could be the best stellar<br /><br />love mia<br /><br />to.everyone
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|A good read and my first by lee child. I can tell I am hooked on Jack Reacher and will undoubtebly read them all.
B000002W3R|5.0|I got this for a gift for an Elvis fan. He says this is the best quality so far. He loves it.
B00AIBZJS4|4.0|To be completely honest, I think I did enjoy the 3-D experience in the theatre more than the Blu-ray Disc, and that's saying something since I generally do not like 3-D. That being said, the combination of James Cameron nad Cirque Du Soleil is a match made in heaven. This is a visual delight that's filled with breathtaking skill and front row seat views. Definitely worth the money.
B006H5120E|5.0|I had seen this in the theatres when it came out and wanted it for my first 3D movie to view when I got my TV and Blu-ray with 3D. It was so interesting to watch in 3D as you could actually get an idea of the massive size of the ship and so many other details that escape you when viewing the normal 2D version.
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|All of Kurt's albums are great and 'Wakin On A Pretty Daze' is absolutely no exception. Listen to it and love it...
B005FITIDC|3.0|Not as good as the previews indicated. He is an interesting speaker as I heard his story at the church I attended when he was a speaker in person. The problem still exists and has not been resolved.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My husband uses car chargers more often than I do. So I let him test this for me in his regular use. He came back very happy.<br /><br />The reason he was happy is that it actually works. It charges his Apple devices quickly and a lot better than a standard USB adapter charger does, and will charge his phone at the same time. It's easy to use and the ports are a good fit with a good connection. He's had issues in the past with adapters in the same price range that needed to be set just right to charge because the ports were a little off.<br /><br />The size it nice, the fact it charges fast is a real plus. His commute is fairly short, so he uses it to top off his phone battery generally and it's been working very well for that.<br />[The product reviewed was provided to me at no cost for the purposes of review. I received no other compensation, and my review is my honest opinion of the product.]
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an awesome game. very addicting. you will play it for hours. sometimes doesn't react as fast as your finger though.
B00000FC5H|4.0|Every song on the album is a true hit and brings back memories.  The songs are frequently used as soundtracks in movies and on TV; or they should be!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this show, I was so sad to see it end. I'm looking for more shows like it. WONDERFUL......WONDERFUL.......WONDERFUL
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on this show!  Can't believe that they killed off Lady Sybil!  But it is just fabulous!!
B009FZHYKU|2.0|It got into the stupid relationship drama that everyone loved this show for, the lack of relationship and personal BS..
B008P3SPVU|3.0|An OK film to show people how sports and education should work hand in hand and not against each other.<br />Pretty traditional tale of somebody coming into an inner city school to help out a group of troubled youth.
B00BRR66SA|4.0|I think it's a great album, and I can listen to it front to back, but I think some of the songs are a bit too long. I don't have a problem with long songs (I'm a classic rock fan) but JT's tend to lost a bit of steam towards the end.<br /><br />But, I would recommend this album to anyone who's a fan of the Modern Pop 'genre'.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|We enjoyed watching it.  It was lively and sweet.  It gave a picture of the oh so different life in Yemen, and added a bit of drama, and told about the odd way salmon behave.  It could not actually happen, but you almost believe that it could.
B002C949KE|4.0|We only have the potential to make rational decisions. Very interesting to see how human decision making is effected by surroundings, personal predjudice, and ego. A lot of money, and heartache can be saved by a scientific approach to decision making.
B000MG1ZG0|5.0|This is a solid remix. I do have the earlier versions though in the earlier boxset.  Which are the versions you heard for all those years of this classic disc. the doors had been attacked for making a lush pop rock disc in 1969. ((which is a great disc actually) and had a number one hit on it!  Still this was the age of rock must be rock only and the boys bounced back with this classic. It's almost as good as the monster classic 'la woman' even. It's got solid songs and the fantastic 'roadhouse blues' , 'peace frog'' , 'blue sunday' , 'you make me real' and others are on here. Strangely they finally put out their 1968 song 'waiting for the sun' on this one. (and it fits in well, although one must wonder why they named that earlier disc 'waiting for the sun' when the didn't have the title song on it! However fans finally got to hear that song on this one. the remixes are good but have added some changes that were left off when the disc was mastered in 1970. this may upset some people. but these were recorded at the time and not in 2007. I am glad though that I have the earlier boxset for sure. However this is a great version of this classic disc. and worth owning.
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|I love this show.. If anyone is looking for a show to make them laugh, this is the show to watch.
158234082X|5.0|What is so amazing about this book is the fact of Mr. Bourdain's ability to take something that is so true and recreate hilarious moments. Thirty-five years of kitchen experience gave me a cast of characters who, although their names were different from Mr. Bourdain's partners in crime, were introduced as the same people I knew and worked with. Anyone who appreciates dining out should read this book, not to see the &#34;under belly&#34; of the culinary experience, but to appreciate the diverse cast of characters who make our fine dining experience possible. Laughed until I cried.
B00005B6C9|5.0|My mom is 74, she LOVES the BeeGees!  She had heard of this CD and was telling me about it while I was on the phone with her.  I don't live near her right now, and this was at Christmastime.  While on the phone with her, I placed the order, and she received it just a few days later in time for Christmas.  She says, its a wonderful CD and it's different from their normal music.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I found Kate a wonderful story teller and am now working my way through her other books. I am having really pleasurable experiences with the discovery of this author.
1452101248|5.0|I was not sure if I would like this book since we're not vegetarians. But the recipes are absolutely delicious! I find myself taking the book with me just in case I get inspired to look for ingredients! There are some new spices we had not tried. However, many of the herbs and spices I was already familiar with were used in ways I had never considered. Some of the recipes are very simple, which even works on a week night.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|To me, this film shows Why big wave surfers can use the word &#34;stoked&#34;. . .shows the perseverance and skills needed to slay the dragon waves. . .See it. Loved the fact that a few actual big wave surfers are in the cast. . .
0316224588|5.0|I have been reading Ian Rankin's books for years. Have missed John Rebus, just not the same without him. This book is wonderful. John rebus is still John Rebus, this is John at his best full of twist and turns. Rebus being Rebus. I hope Ian Rankin never lets him go again. A whole new career has just been opened. A must read for Rankin fans.
0316743003|5.0|Read this book! Much better than Kelly Johnsons. More relevant stories, anecdotes, quotes from other people in the programs, etc. Absolutely one of my favorite books I've read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It definitely kept my attention but I hoped the ending would be different. That is one crazy, mixed up life!
B003WE9TU8|2.0|I feel like I've been slowly battered to death by the leaden prose. This book has some good sections, to my estimate about one third of it is ok, maybe ten per cent is good. But large parts are turgid, slow, repetitive and soulless. The book's main problem is the lack of any people to actually care about. The bits I enjoyed were where you could follow a character's experiences. But too often, the voice of the character was monotonous and uninteresting.
B000FA675C|4.0|I read this the first time back in 2004. I read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down. It intrigued me. I'm not religious but it drew me in, made me want to know more about the history of Christianity, of fine art. I even took a class in college I would never have taken otherwise because I had to learn more! I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Very entertaining and well-written.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|If you like Jason Stathan, this is a great action packed movie, it will keep you going from the begining to the finish.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|My dad wanted all four of the lethal weapons on dvd since he is a truckdriver and he can watch them on his laptop when he is resting for the night.
1451696191|5.0|Bought this book for my daughter who heard it's a good read. Managed to find this seller @Amazon.com for its lowest price. Would recommend it to teenagers who enjoy reading
B009G41CG2|4.0|Always liked the games that cause you to have to think to win. Haven't been playing them very long but have really gotten into the game.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun so far...I only wish they had made the horses' gait more realistic....otherwise, the horse looks and does good :)
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|ruins the enjoyment of playing any game when you are interrupted multiple times with the same offers.  Take a hint, I do not want to download that offer.  Quit already!!!!!
B005F3XV62|4.0|I chose this movie because my wife seen the previews and thought it would be a good movie for the family, it is a great movie and I would recomend it for a great family movie.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I like this album more then the block and made sure it was on my mp3 player for my car so I could listent to when I'm not home.  My son who is 6 also likes songs off this album.
1451668945|5.0|It was a pleasure to read another Mary Higgins Clark Mystery. I cannot wait for the next one. We need writers who give us a good<br />book to enjoy.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Real love gives of itself and is sacrificial.  This book was about true love that lives on forever. It captured my heart.
B000ID37KO|5.0|one of my  favorits. I could watch this movie over and over again. not to scarry but scarry enought, I like a lot of Hitchcock movies.
1401235417|5.0|Capullo and Snyder have created the best Batman to date. Visually stunning, well paced, and overall a great read. This team has me back to reading comics again.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|A gorgeous, moving and completely original documentary, made even more beautiful through a careful digital transfer to Blu-Ray disc. Worth every penny - each revisit is a fresh experience.
B006P8KWYA|5.0|My son likes to listen to soft music when he gose to bed and he went from jewels lullabys to this one in no time and hasn't changed backed.
B00633W614|5.0|Love it!  As an avide Jeffrey Archer fan, this chronology of Harry Clifton & all those intertwined in his life is riveting.  I also love the way Archer combined 1st & 3rd-person narrative.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This whole series was way better than the movie ever was. I couldn't put the book down not any of the other books in the series. I read all of the in a two week period which for me is unheard of. Love them.<br />Dawn
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A really good book worth reading and re-reading.<br />What a man. It's a pity that men and women of this caliber sometimes go so fast...<br />I did not know Adam Brown,  but I got to know him through this book and I miss him.
B00913DPW2|2.0|thisgame sucks. becauseit is so hard I cant star this game. when ever I play this game I don't even what
B00BEOYPKW|5.0|What a treat! Hadn't discovered him till this week but this has been on constant play. With 'Smoke Ring' makes for coupla hours of great listening with more to discover each time. On list for album of the year. Had to rethink that on further listen - it's bloody marvellous!
B00931JMRE|5.0|I got this for my dad who likes zztop and he told me he likes it.  It is like the old stuff befire afterburner. If you like zztop you should give this a try.
1451648537|5.0|I grew-up in a similar time frame, enjoying electronics as a hobby all my life, building my first computer in 1975 the hard-way as a kit with a soldering-iron (IMSAI-8080). Those were incredibly exciting times, riding the crest of a wave of revolution. It was also a period of explosive social change. This book is an essential documentary of part of that. It also documents how some folks at the right place and time -- with the abilities to make things happen, CAN alter the future, fundamentally. It also speaks to excellence, accept nothing less. I'd recommend this book to anyone either looking back or looking forward - a good mentor-gift for coming generations.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series is interesting, inspiring and educational. The only complaint I have is regarding the reception. The reception was interrupted approximately every 2 minutes. If I had not found the series so interesting, I would have given up. I have only watched the first four in the series.
1878424505|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read.  I keep reading it over and over.  This book will change your life.  If you integrate these four practices into your life, you'll life will improve immensely.  (From other sources, I have confirmations rather regularly that these truths are timeless and priceless.)  I now own four of his books and keep re-reading all of them. If I had to narrow my library down to only a few books, anything by this author would be my choice.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|Met my expected standard of a 007 film. Would have expected a more scintallating conclusion that would have made us anticipate the next Bond film.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Good movie, but I'm going to have to watch it again when there is not kids around because I was kinda of confused.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I found this song after we went and saw the movie oz the great and powerful.  I listen to it and really liked it so I bought it and now when my son hears it he starts to sing along too.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|love this movie and will  probably buy it soon. Hope everyone will take the time to watch this movie soon!
B000IDEQTK|4.0|Good movie but difficult to watch because of the interruptions. Think it took me two days to complete watching the movie.
0811875040|2.0|From the recipe description and pictures I thought they would be a lot better than they were, I made three different recipes following the steps exactly and they all turned out really bad!! The book design and pictures are very cute. Overall a huge disappointment, maybe one day i'll get to try the items in the store and they'll be better.
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Back in 1977, drive-time radio was promoting LOGAN'S RUN so effectively that I had to see it immediately! And so I did- at a New York City First Run screening. Dolby Stereo was in its infancy, but the discrete 4 channel (\\"Quadraphonic\\") mag track was fabulous! As a radio producer on NYC's iconoclastic WBAI, I had received a promotional copy of the soundtrack--on vinyl of course. This score was written by Hollywood Legend Jerry Goldsmith. At the time there was an urban legend floating around that Jerry Goldsmith was a pen name used by Leonard Bernstein.<br /><br />No matter- I fell in love with the score. I also was privy to a \\"behind the scenes\\" documentary (16mm film) that I transferred to open-reel video using a telecine. The production  looked destined to become the next Star Wars.<br /><br />OK- so this is no Star Wars. However, it is still very good Science Fiction. Unlike Star Wars,  LOGAN'S RUN was never intended to be a special effects extravaganza. Young audiences will probably find the sets and production design cheesy if not laughable. There is nothing cheap here (it probably cost a fortune)--but it may look so to a generation brought up with  the digital magic of today. Everyone in LOGAN'S RUN sport long shaggy hair with costume design to match. If I were to say that LOGAN'S RUN  looks like a typical TV episode of Star Trek, I'm wouldn't be that far off.  Makeup was under the direction of William Tuttle- the artist who first introduced our imaginations to Romulans, Klingons and even Mr. Spock's ears.<br /><br />Does any of this dated technology interfere with the story? That's up to you to decide. The look of LOGAN'S RUN is pretty much on par with that of Richard Donner's Krypton and other SciFi epics of its time.<br /><br />LOGAN'S RUN's world is occupied by adorable (if not outright sexy), nubile young people. Here, they all cavort in suggestive Grecian tunics. The main set for LOGAN'S RUN's \\"City\\"; is instantly recognizable as a typical major city shopping mall. Where else would you expect nubile young people to spend their hedonistic days?<br /><br />The premise of this tale is very believable and strikes a chord even in the 21st Century. The actors do their very best with the silly dialog. Still, it is all very believable (believe it or not).<br /><br />One of the highlights of LOGAN'S RUN is the wonderful performance of Peter Ustiov as \\"The Old Man\\". His performance alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />So there you have it. LOGAN'S RUN will not bore you. At times it is genuinely sweet and touching. If you came of age in the 1970's, this motion picture will bring back fond memories. Ignore the chuckles of your kids-- there is a even a profound message carefully planted amongst the eye-candy. Go ahead and give this an evening of pop corn-munching camp. Compared to a lot of todays sci-fi fare, you might just find yourself believing that this is a classic. If you are a member of Amazon Prime--- you get to see this for free!<br /><br />This film still makes me smile. Two thumbs up!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Love this show what all season up to 7, I want to get all seven.  Eventually I will because the 2 main characters are hot!!  And the show is good!!!
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I have  never  used this app before downloading  it on my kindle fire. It has worked beautifully for me. The sites are easy to add to my feed and  have had no problems with th  app itself. It's been a great addition to my morning routine.
B000FC146C|5.0|I first read this book as a teenager and I loved it. I was thrilled to find it in Kindle format. It is an epic saga in every sense of the word. The Thorn Birds is one of those books you can read over and over again, and I do.
0545265355|4.0|Although I bought this set as a gift for my granddaughter, I must admit I read and enjoyed the series myself before I sent it off to her.  It was a bit gruesome in places but the story line was fairly solid throughout (except for the ending) and the characters fairly real.  The ending was a disappointment but by then you couldn't imagine how it was going to end anyway.  I'm sure the author had the same problem.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I have owned this movie when you could only buy it on VHS.  This movie is thoroughly enjoyed by three generations of my family: my mother, my daughter and me!  It's epic and hysterical!!  I still think that Sam Rockwell steals so much of the laughs!  &#34;Don't open the door!!!&#34;
B005COO1X6|1.0|Certainly not the calibre of work I expect from Stephen King. The plot and ending were predictable. I will say that despite the shortness of the story, the character development is surprisingly good.The low price was the draw for me.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The shows is very good, will continue to watch it most definitely, can't wait until the next one comes out for sure!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|But then again....I loved all the books in this series!  If you like Mitch Rapp books, you won't be disappointed!
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I got this product cause it showed how you could save time & money replacing batteries, so I got it and charged the battery a whole day and it wasn't charged so I tried it again for another day same thing... This is junk and this seller should be removed from the marketplace for selling &#34;JUNK&#34;
076790592X|5.0|This was the first of Albom's books I read and I've lent it to so many friends it became so thumb-worn I had to replace it with this one.  I'll buy anything Albom writes because he has become one of my favorite authors.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|For your small knife sort of works but you get what you pay for with this one. Perfect for pocket knife
B00992CF6W|5.0|He  likes how he can build new and amazing things on this wonderful game. These are his words exactly. He has been it nonstop since I bought it!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Good Movie, kept your interest the whole time, my son tells me there is another sequelle to come out so we will be waiting for that to come out.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Another winner for Michael Connelly.  This is not one of his most recent novels and the Bosch series is best read in order which I have not done.  It has not taken anything away from the read as Connelly has a way of brining the reader up to date even if you haven't read what came before.  The Concrete Blonde has lots of twists and turns and actually is a dual story with a trial..literally for Bosch running along with his investigation of the mystery of the Concrete Blonde and several more as the killer chooses blonde victims.  A good read and will keep you on the edge as the tale progresses.  Enjoy!
B00846REIS|4.0|If you loved 50 shades like I did and were sad it had to come to an end. Then read this!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a marvelous DVD about a marvelous dog.  So many dogs are mistreated by owner's neglect that I wish I would be able to force those who neglect dogs watch this film.  It would give them a different perspective about their dogs and hopefully see the need to be more attuned to their dog's needs.
0553804367|4.0|A bit fun to read but its really not for education of the subject, it more of a vague overview of his knowledge about the topics. Purely meant for entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!its so fun and addictive. Way better then temple run. Never like a game so much before! I would like more power boosts though. Other then that it's totally epic! You should do more with it! BEST GAME EVER!!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Loved, loved, loved the shows will continue to watch the sequels can't wait to the next one comes out!  The whole family enjoyed the shows!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|One of the best shows ever. We really enjoy it. Much the same with all the Sherlock Holmes movies and the British series, Sherlock.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Here is a history of Tesla along with an in-depth analysis of why geniuses often fail to attract or convince the world. Had Tesla been able to convince the world, electricity and electronics would probably have been a hundred years ahead of its state today.<br /><br />Observations:<br />*** The author writes in a  highly readable manner.<br />*** The intitial analysis is superb for those who wish to know the \\"why\\" of Tesla's fate.<br />*** The book will leave any thinking person deeply moved.<br />*** This willl also tell you what to do and what not to do if you are a genius.<br />*** It will also tell you how geniuses are often cheated by others.<br />*** It will also tell you much about Nikola Tesla.<br />*** It will also leave you sad, as it did to me, if you are a sensitive person.<br /><br />Recommendation:<br />*** I highly recommend this eBook
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Well, I found it very funny and relaxing. Highly recommended not only to those that work in the medical field but also for everyone else!
0061733199|5.0|Full of most things youll ever need and more. I would recommend this book in every bug out bag and every campers pre plan preps
1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy\\" is a comprehensive book about the Michael Jackson that no one knew.  The author has written it from her heart, and she offered it as a free Kindle eBook at the end of December.  Nearly 7,800 people took advantage of this offer!  It's all about Michael Jackson's legacy and the truth.  I recommend this book!
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I like that it is sleek and lighter than the otterbox, and the color is perfect. However, I have had so many problems with the headphone adapters; they're easy to lose, and when you replace them the ones you get on Amazon are way cheaper made and break easily. Also, there is a little bit of space on the side so I'm too afraid to even put it in water with my phone inside. I did the water test before the phone was in there and it was fine, but the gap showed up after the phone was inside. So I'm not sure, but I'm not very pleased.
B004I744AS|4.0|Finally, a dictionary that puts the definition immediately at your fingertips!  No scrolling from here to there.  Just type in the word (of course, you need to spell it correctly)  and there's the result.  A breeze to use!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Great purchase. Love Elton. Brings back memories of my mother,and my dear friends I lost to Aids. Will cherish these songs.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Loved it, all the twists, I kept trying to figure it out and my theories would be shot down, but great read.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|I know these games rely on microtransactions to make money (see the new game informer)<br /> but the prices to upgrade are sick! I would gladly pay twenty dollars to own the game and unlock good cards as I play. But to even randomly attempt getting rare and epic cards would exceed a PS3 or 360 game price. Really?
B007NZDES0|5.0|This is a great live DVD.  She sounds great, has just enough going on for the live show.  Sexy concert.  I have watched it 3 times already.
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|This movie is so touching even the funny parts make me tear up.  It just proves you don't have to have blood, weird characters and/or violence to make a great movie.
1885167776|5.0|I personally heard Gary Keller speak yesterday for nearly four hours on his new book, \\"The One Thing\\".  I was truly amazed by his enthusiasm of his message and at the rich content.  His book is so applicable for today's business person, parent or individual seeking to better themselves and the lives of those around them.  I told a friend later that afternoon that Gary's information found in his new book is \\"worth $1,000,000 in annual income\\" to me!  The book is very well laid out and easy to follow.  I believe it could have a huge and very positive impact in your life!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Fun game to pass the time.  Kinda twisted to destroy humanity but its still fun.  The Zombies are fun to move into areas that haven't been infected.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|As always Archer excells in storytelling.  I read it as lmost non-stop.  Leaves a cliffhanger but kind of predictable in that sense.<br />The pity is the wait for the next installment.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|difficult obtaining dollars for purchase.<br />Challenge was moving around the secure fences<br />Once my son figured out challenge faustration diminished
B0001I561E|1.0|The movie film was peeling off of the DVD disc when we opened the movie to watch it. My 4 year old daughter was very disappointed and upset, it was such a waste of my time & my money!
B000SEGTI0|5.0|Dick was a fountain of ideas.  So many stories owe a credit to this one as a source of inspiration that it is ridiculous that you have not already read this.  Get it and read it.  Re-read it.  Come back to it later.  ...So many great thoughts inside!
B00B2R5G54|1.0|I tried many times and could not watch the episode for more than a few seconds before it would freeze
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This is a must have movie in a dvd collection. This one of best Baseball<br />pictures ever made and the acting was superb.
