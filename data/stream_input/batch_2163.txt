B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started Downton Abbey this year and I am totally addicted!  It is great fun catching up with the Crowleys.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I just love getting inspired on pintrest and look at it all of the time. This app works great and I never have any issues
B000FBFN1U|5.0|George R.R. Martin never fails to keep me interested.  This book is permanently in my Kindle as well as all of his other books.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It is holding my interest, but I wouldn't say it's a great book. I am reading it for my bookclub, I probably wouldn't of chosen it for myself.  It's a bit repetitive as far as the content.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am hooked, I could not put it down.  George R.R. Martin never fails to keep me interested and keeps making me change my favorite character.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Thought provoking, but not overwhelmingly convincing.  I thought that the logic was a bit thin in a number of places.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie belongs up in the echelon of the great James Bond films. It is a well balanced film that mixes many of the great elements that made the films what they are for 50 years, while at the same time adding a fresh spin along with beautiful cinematography and direction.<br /><br />After a weak showing in QoS, this film returns to the momentum made with Casino Royale and re-establishes Bond as the go-to guy in a game fought in the shadows.
B002S5N04I|5.0|What can I say.; love the books, movies, and the music.  I still own vinyl records so I was glad to see them produce the Twilght soundtrack in vinyl to add to my coleection.
B007G5K066|5.0|This is a great spy movie with the essence being the true spirit of espionage and betrayal. It is hard to get people to appreciate such a movie today as most films are usually saturated with excess to make up for poor film making. This film is riveting and suspenseful and does so without &#34;dumbing&#34; it down.<br /><br />One note on the &#34;digital copy,&#34; when you receive the film, the case does not display that it has a digital copy included. Rest easy, as there is a slip inside the case with both a UV copy and a digital download copy as well.
B001I82RU4|5.0|I was happy they sold theTwilght soundtrack in vinyl as I am a collector. Music is wonderful. Love the The Twilight Saga.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Like all of Clancy this book was well researched and very timely to current events.  I recommend to anyone who likes a mistery
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|No plot, it is not worth watching. No real acting-lots of chase scenes if thats all you need! not recommend at all.
B00846REIS|5.0|Lose yourself in a mindless novel about love and sex......better than 50 Shades!<br />Be sure to read it I am moving on to the next one ....
0316172324|3.0|I would be very careful about reading psyche books where the author is not a christian. (I know find one that is right?) However there are some fascinating discoverys in this book. Although apart from God they are vain.
1440503257|5.0|This book arrived very quickly and in great shape!  I was able to use the packaging material to send it on to my granddaughter with a valentine tucked inside!  The whole transaction went smoothly and very quickly!  She is pleased with the book--and I must confess, I copied some recipes for myself before I sent it on!
B00A17AD36|5.0|I got THIRTY songs for 9.99 and each one is worth a hell-uv-alot more than that! It's one of those gems in your music collection you're proud to have BOUGHT.
1452110581|5.0|I got this book and shared it at coffee with some friends.  Then one of my friends took it to their New Year's Eve party.  All the cat lovers there thought it was great...it turned out to be the hit of the party---&#34;read another poem!&#34;
B00992CF6W|4.0|I just wanted Tnt on this but it doesn't its fun but trust me when I say its amazing with Tnt
B00821OX98|4.0|I'm still going through the series. The basis of the storyline is at least plausible at the root - an invading force essentially wipes out America and leaves scattered resistance militias to carry on the fight. Militias are made up of men, women, and teenagers - whoever is capable of using a gun and following tactical orders from the militia command. The aliens have a few decades or a century or so jump on Earth in terms of technology, but they're not invincible - they can be killed with ordinary weapons (even knives, or in one case, a scalpel), their scout/fighter craft can be shot down, and their \\"mechs\\" (robots) can be handled with heavy machine guns or explosives. The aliens themselves look like something that might be boiled alive and eaten with drawn butter, except that they're pretty big, agile, and physically strong. They are controlled by or answer to manager or executive that is of another species of alien and looks nothing like them. Many commonly-shared societal values are explored, tested, and sometimes bent and pushed to their limits.<br /><br />The only thing I'd like to see improved about the series would be to shoot more daylight scenes. Most of the action takes place in the dark. I guess it's easier (and probably cheaper) to do at night, especially in terms of making the special effects more believable. But watching it on a laptop's LCD display requires a dark room and the screen brightness turned all the way up in order to properly see what's going on.<br /><br />It's one of the better made-for-TV sci-fi shows I've watched in the last few years that kept me wanting to see the next episode. Others have come and gone that didn't do that.<br /><br />Post Script: Watched all episodes of both seasons. As usual, the producers and/or studio decided two seasons were enough and left everyone hanging. They did that with the original Star Trek series on TV and look where that went. Maybe it's time for a \\"Falling Skies\\" feature length movie. I'd go see it.
3438052229|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I enjoy working with it. It is a must have for those who study hebrew.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I liked season one, but season two is much better. I also love that their are more episodes. That was my big issue with season one. I love the new characters too.
B00701L5XS|5.0|Got this app free as 'app of the day'however I would quite happily have paid for it. I make jewellery as a hobby and have been trying to get to grips with a Josephine knot for a while, this clever app showed me how in the 'decorative knots' category.It also shows nautical,climbing and loads of other knots.<br />I would definitely recommend this app.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the show and season three is the best so far! I cannot wait to see the rest of the season!
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the best Bond film I have seen.  The villain is my favorite so far.  The transfer to Blu-ray is beautiful and the sound is magnificent.  Although I enjoyed the previous two installations in the series, this one has a much better story that kept me riveted to my seat the entire movie.  It does feel a little slow during the first half, but once we meet the villain (played by Javier Bardem) it is a nonstop adventure.  I also love that there isn't a focus on Bond sleeping with women.  I know that is a staple of the films, but it never adds anything to the story or character development.  We see Bond hookup with a woman, but it is quick and we don't see any intimacy.  Also, the new actors introduced help keep the movie feeling fresh and I look forward to seeing them return in the next film.  I was surprised with the loss of a major character, but that is what helped keep the film interesting up to the end.  I will definitely be watching this again and again when I am in the mood for an action film with a great story.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Don't care what the Academy Awards idiots say, this was the best move of the year.  I you have not seen it, get it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was more suspenseful than his usual tear jerker.  Could not put it down until it was finished.  From the proms for the movie I don't think the movie can do the book justice.  Worth reading book again.
B005LAII1C|5.0|We loved this movie..!  A good buy..!  It's hilarious and Mark W. is funny as well as Ted the bear.  I would recommend this movie..!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book!  It reminds me how incredible the power of love and the human spiritual can be.  Can't wait to read more!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Without a doubt the best book of the series. The story flows and moves with a quick pace, lots of blood and guts, backstabbing and clever plotting.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|Such a funny movie with effects that are impressive to this day. I love the clever way they incorporated pop culter and rumors into the MIB story and undercover task force. Classic for the DVD collection
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addicting!  I can not stop playing this game! Great content and game play especially for a free game. sow
B009YP9L7U|4.0|A great one day read. Likable characters without distracting backstory.  Shows w all need parts of our best friend in the ones we love.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very accurate & informative, works well!! I've used it on my kindle fire and installed it on my sons' kindles as well. Easy to use for my 10 & 6 year olds.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|A bit different than the orginal movie, which I happened to catch on TCM recently.  It's not a movie to make you think, it's a movie to entertain.  Action scenes are good and definitely entertaining.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is such a great Christmas movie.  A timeless classic for everyone to enjoy.  We watch it every Christmas and I plan to share it with my granddaughter as she gets older.
B000IOM0X8|5.0|Sometimes you just want a movie to entertain, not one that you really have to think about.  This is a good one, at least for me.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Saw in movie theater and disappointed. Bond is action and women but this??? I understand that this one dealt with some human type issues, which are new for old James Bond but did not really care all that much. Wanted action and steady pacing. This one did not have enough action and pacing was very, very uneven. Lots and lots and lots of talk. Know that it has done well at the box office but can't understand why. One of the poorer Bond movies in my opinion. Guess it could be considered a date movie and might even work for the wife.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Tommy Lee was great, as was John Goodman and Ned Beatty.  I had never seen this movie and was definitely NOT disappointed.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was letting Ned get away with killing the guy from years ago.  Would recommend.
B002NJWHHA|3.0|Acting was fair. Casting not the greatest, nor was the special effects. Not quite a B movie. acutally fell asleep
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Just read it. Not much I can say. These are filler words that are required for this review I'm doing.
0525953728|5.0|Finished it during the Christmas holiday.  Left it with my son in law who really enjoyed it too..  Exiting account of the actual event. by one of the very men involved.  Seal team six is so special to our country!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Best read of the year! I need the next book NOW--not tomorrow. This is Lord of The Flies as we all hoped it would play out. Humanity thrives when authors show ordinary people making extraordinary choices because that is the right thing to do. An inspiration for all that is hopeful in this world and a must read for any thinking person! .
B0076DELIG|4.0|Good book.  Great characters; lots of suspense; and twists were enough to keep anyone's interest.  Love the accuracy and first hand experience of surviving the L.A. riots.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I really liked this one! I read the racketeer last week and the brethren a long time ago and loved both. The litigators was a little predictable but was very humorous at times!! I laughed out loud several times. I am thankful that my local library has great books available for the kindle! Easy to check out and no late fees!!

B004P8JPS6|5.0|Good book this one was hard to put down  it seems each book gets better.  Will now try to see the movie.
1451695195|5.0|I wish that everyone would read this!  for it would change the human interactions in this world and move us into a higher place of consciousness and hopefully help us move beyond this stage of violence into compassionate living!  Thank you Dr. Alexander!  I am teaching it in several settings within my church.  Rev. Lee A. Ireland

0891419063|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband and he's hardly been able to put it down!  He said that it's well written and the contents are so very interesting.  He'll probably look for more books by E. B. Sledge.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero is a fast paced story you'll never want to put down! I loved it! An exciting book for anyone at any age.
B007REV4T8|5.0|The movie Skyfall was like I expected, it is a  great movie at a great price. Came 2 days earlier then expected.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has a desire to learn about the Navy Seals and gain a look into the true dedication and selflessness they serve their country with.<br /><br />The actual fire fight and deaths of of the members of the seal team will bring you to tears...as you gain a true perspective<br />of what these and other combat military personnel have to endure.  Furthermore, the survivor guilt is so poignent that<br />it may make you physically ill, as it did me
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Ordered Taken and Taken 2 at same time. Watched both movies in order. Both were great. Received the movies 1 day early.
0425264351|4.0|After learning about the Jack Reacher character from seeing the current movie, decided to give the first book in the series a try.  It was a good read overall.  Two things I didn't like - for my taste way more graphic then necessary on some of the torture segments.  And Reacher is ridiculously knowledgeable about every subject discussed.<br /><br />Aside from that it was entertaining, tense at times and a decent conclusion.  I would consider reading another in the series.  If I could give half starts, I would go with 3.5.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Great movie and could hardly wait to watch Sly is always good. Great movie for my collection. Received on time.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|My grandson LOVES this game ...~! He has so much fun playing this game everywhere we go~!

B004TI5N38|4.0|Hard to put it down - New twist every few pages.  Conclusion a bit unreal, but still an engrossing read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Quality entertainment, no foul language, and bears witness that no one is exempt from life changing events and the tragedies life holds for each of us.  Get Season 4 on the air!!

B000FBJHT4|3.0|While I have no basis to dispute the author's assertions I do know from first hand knowledge at least one of the technologies he asserts came from Roswell came from the minds of a team I was directly associated with. The bottom line that we have had &#34;close encounters of the third kind&#34; - I hope that is fact. Read and draw your own impression - fact or fiction it is worth the price paid.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|My wife had seen this somewhere and asked me to look it up.  So I did and we watched it. Fortunately it did not have the over the top drama but it did have great value in reminding us that computers can do many things and help with daily life, but they do not have any of the essential senses that we do, when we know we did something right just by the sound of it. I would recommend to anyone just to remind us that we all can do things right based on our experiences.
B005URRCUY|5.0|I had not heard of this band before and I love the entire album. Great  lyrics and music. I would definitely buy for a gift for someone  who likes music
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This does what I was looking to get. A simple file browser that I can use to view images and folders in their hierarchy and organize what I have on my tablet.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Very evocative. Recalls lovely days and nights in Hawaii. Highly recommended as an intro to Hawaiian music. A variety of artists.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Loved the book, easy to read and very interesting.  As someone who already &#34;believed&#34; reading this was fascinating, I learned more about something I am very interested in and explore any chance I get.  Thank you for sharing your story.
B002SR2PKG|2.0|This review will not address the content of the book, but rather the formatting of the Kindle edition.<br /><br />A publisher would never release a print edition of a book without thorough and repeated proof-reading.  However, they seem to have no problem doing so with e-books.  \\"It\\" contains numerous formatting problems (e.g. spaces between periods and closing quotation marks) as well as many typos.  Spending time trying to decipher the text takes away from the enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />It appears that the publisher recently pulled the book to do a clean-up, and while that may have taken care of some of the problems it has a long way to go.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The best sci-fi saga continues with uniquely new stories to keep your interest. I recommend this to any scientific fan.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Well thought out and different take on Zobism.  Many of the ideas and stories would be appropriate to any outbreak.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I started to play as soon as I downloaded this and I can hardly put it down. I like trying<br />to beat my last time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is a great game its just like raising a real horse you clean groom feed and treat it you can buy even more horses you can also train it to be in races so get it now!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|A great read! It's fun, not to heavy. Entertaining! It is a bit of a young read but it's easy & it's clever. I really enjoyed it....
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the large size of the numbers.  I had a different app but it was too difficult to use.  I love this one!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game beacauase it lets kids express them selves by allowing them to build their own dragon park!!!
0061733199|5.0|I just got in in and have only skimmed through it yet but it seems to have almost everything, and the illustrations' details are great. Looking forward to sitting down and reading it. The way this country is heading, we may need to memorize this stuff.
0307477479|5.0|I was introduced to the book in my Contemporary Lit class. It's one of those interconnected lives stories, which will remind you of the formats of cheesy rom-coms such as Love Acutally, Valentine's Day, or New Year's Eve, but I can assure you that's where the similarities end. There are jumps in time and changes in characters that at times, seem abrupt and a few people might find it difficult to follow. Nonetheless, it's worth it to follow through because the end is that much more rewarding. Every one of the characters is destructive and startlingly self-aware of both their own conditions and of those around them. The novel opens to Sasha, an assistant to an recording exec. She is a raging klepto who cannot control herself when she sees an object lying around. It is revealed in a later chapter that her kleptomaniac tendencies begin out of necessity and degenerate into the more serious state that consumes her later on. Her boss is going through a mid-life crisis, struggling to keep his libido and strike a quasi-relationship with his son. The novel comes full circle in the end by telling the story of a character to which we are introduced in the beginning.<br /><br />Each character has an interesting story to tell and in a way, remind us of a little bit of ourselves. What we know about the characters are the small glimpses offered throughout. In a sense, we never get the whole picture, just like we can never really \\"catch up\\" with our old friends on everything that has happened to them. I absolutely loved this book and I always recommend it to people asking for book suggestions. It has changed my perception of what a novel is and what it should be (as many people have noted, there is a chapter comprised solely of a powerpoint). Though I have no pull with the publishing world, I can say that A Visit From the Goon Squad is every bit deserving of the Pulitzer it won.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game...once I started, I found it nearly impossible to stop playing! The graphics are wonderful. The puzzles are challenging. You will enjoy it.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This game will not load on my kindle fire, there;s always a error that it has to be restarted but it will never work.  Very disappointing, my brother loves it on his.  He's afraid to update it and have the same thing happen to him.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Just got this today and am already addicted. I like the different classes though I wish the characters were a bit more customizable. But for a free game it has great graphics and a great play. Fun slash and grab game.
1609611543|1.0|Not impressed. If you are into spending a lot of time reading labels and preparing foods or have an aversion to wheat then go for it. Too complicated and annoying to have to follow thru with everything. Goes into the yard sale.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have been a fan of hers since I first heard her on Britains got talent. I only hope she realizes what a God given talent she has and that it doesn't go to her head. God truly had a plan for her. In seconds, she went from obscurity to stardom. So far she is using it well. I'll be looking for more from her.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a good thing for me to play and it is cool for Saint patches day it is awesome and I love it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|VERY good story.  I first saw movie and really liked it.  I thought I might not enjoy the book so much but I was wrong.  I also like happy but believable endings.  I loved all the characters but most especially Pats mother.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it I play it all the time in between classes at school and just killing yimeat home my kids also love playing this game
B002M9WW30|1.0|I was so happy when i finally was able to order this. It arrived in a timely fashion, but much to my dismay when i went to put in Rocky IV, Rocky V, & Rocky balboa they didnt work. Rocky 1 - 3 worked fine... honestly, i wouldn't have been heart broken if Rocky V didn't work considering it is garbage, but ROCKY IV???!!!! so, i am sending it back, i cant even exchange it because there isn't any more available...
B006OAB3ME|4.0|Here, the legend makes a valiant attempt to show he can do old Crosby, Mercer, etc.tunes. Like so many other older pop idols (like Brian Wilson and R. Stewart, for a start), he gives it his best shot, and the renditions here are really smooth, and generally light, even fun; Diana Krall helps a lot with some of her mild and low-key back-ups, and arrangements. No complaints at all, and was surprised to read the notes with Paul saying John was into these older pre-rock songs as well (like \\"Little White Lies\\"). I always thought Paul was the one who appreciated older musical/ show tune/movie derived songs. Guess I was wrong!...Anyway, definitely worth a listen, though as is normal, the originals (like Mercer and Bing doing \\"Accentuate the Positive\\" eg) are usually the best renditions. Also, interesting how Paul's mild singing here on some songs for me at least was nearly unrecognizable (normal after all these years). \\"My Valentine\\", an original, is a nice touch to a nice, slightly loungey sound!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though there were loses in this season, the writing, and acting was as impeccable as the previous two seasons. It's just so hard to wait for Season 4!
B00012FXAE|5.0|This edition has been digitally remastered and is not grainy, contrary to what another reviewer wrote. Excellent buy for Alien fans.
B008BDZP3K|5.0|Zappa has put out loads of albums.  To me, often his songs are hit or miss.  Not here.<br />This entire album is great and simply a classic.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|&#34;Once&#34; may well be the best music film of our generation.  A chance encounter on a Dublin street between an Irish singer-songwriter and a Czech expat (never sure if she's in the country legally or not) begins a lovely story of friendship based on mutual respect for talent and genuine affection. I checked the DVD out of the local library only to find a damaged spot that completely disrupted the continuity of the story. I was glad to see it uninterrupted. Just as my favorite movie &#34;Besieged&#34; gets at love better than any story I've ever seen, &#34;Once&#34; does the same for friendship. &#34;Once&#34; is a lovely, lovely story. And the music is terrific.
B00AW0KHMY|3.0|The Best Buy website shows the entire Twilight movie collection on 5 Blu-Ray discs and includes the BD1 Extended Edition as well as Digital Copies (Cinema Now though) for $45. There are no details though other than a 3/2 street date - but from the reviews I've seen there are no extras - just the movies.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game gets funner and funner each game you unlock. Many many hours wasted playing this game. thanks for helping me waste time! I look forward to each new game I unlock!
B008XX6J4C|4.0|This CD has a great variety of music.  These musicians are very original in the type of art they create.  Everyone who listens to our copy wants to go buy this CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how u get 2 groom the horse and train it so fun and very intertaning. I would recommend it to everone
B005JR4K28|3.0|This show is sure to make you laugh but it has very adult-themed subject matter.  You want to make sure all of the kids are in bed before you push play on this show.
B007IK44CK|3.0|It is your typical one man army saving the world from disaster. Although I did like some of the special effects.
B000HWZ5WO|3.0|Should you put on the head phones and listen to this song.  It is most interesting.  And, what about the instruments used.  Did the guitar run his licks thru an electronic devise to obtain the tubual sound, or, was this sound produced from simply a wine bottle?  Either way it was pretty cool to listen to.  Thank you Mr. Plant!
B000HZED8S|4.0|I liked 1930's styling and grandiose shots that are best experienced on a large screen. Acting is not too bad either.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! I was reading it every chance I had! I want my own ChristiN Grey!
0307341577|5.0|It is not often I find a fiction book this excellent to read.  The story is mostly narrated by a 30-something woman named Libby Day, who's family was murdered in cold blood 25 years ago.  The story develops as other character's points-of-view are told, but not in first person, as Libby's is.  Libby was a witness to the murders and pointed to her brother as the killer.  Everyone believed her, supposedly.  Jump to present day when she's short on money and someone offers her some to talk to her brother, her father and a bunch of other people who want to know the REAL answer to the mystery.  The story unfolds from there and the author builds an excellent tale of 'who done it'.  I was so surprised at the way the stories of all the separate characters intertwined.  The timing and thought process of each individual character was carefully thought out and well written.  The author really knows how to build your interest.  This book is better than most movies I've seen in the last 5 years.  Gillian Flynn ends each chapter in a way that adds to the suspense.  And in the end it ties together horrifyingly well.  Not to mention the book is well written, not repetitive in any way and not cheesy at all.<br /><br />I know a lot of people say the story is not believable, but it's obviously a fictional story.  Of course I'm not expecting it to be completely believable, but the author did a damn good job making it as close as possible while still keeping the mystery alive.<br /><br />This book was not my first choice by this author (I've not yet read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; but after this it's on my list) but I'm SOO glad I ended up buying it.  I will definitely be reading more from this author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series has been one of the best I've ever read. It has definitely become one of my favorites. I highly recommend these books, you won't be disappointed.
B0080CKGZE|3.0|I was just looking for something different - watched this due to the actor. filled the evening with something better than what the local chanels offered
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very intense! It keeps you into the movie the entire time. I highly recommend it! You won't be disappointed. Argo-F-yourself!
B004IHE2B4|5.0|My son loves Lego's. Christmas was a Lego Theme. He received two of the running Lego trains and this flexible track was an additional. Added to the overall fun by enlarging the tracks. He loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|An edge of your seat series.  A little gory at times. but worth watching. Love it!  The characters are very well thought out with each dealing with different subjects.
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|Oh man, This was suppose to be a gift for a girl i dearly care about but i want to keep it for myself now.<br /><br />it's beautifully designed with letter embossed title on the lenticular picture of the cover picture on the sleeve.<br />kinda hefty weight for a movie but it looks great. Highly recommend owning this movie in this edition. I love it and hope the girl will too :D
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I am a huge Star Wars fan and Angry Birds as well.  What a great way to mix both of the best together.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is a great product. I'm in a calculus 2 class currently and this adds to my understanding of the material a bit better.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|Our Family is a big fan of the series, both old and new versions.  Can't get enough of them.  No cable, so this is the only legit way to watch it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My son loves this game.  He plays it on his grandmother's Kindle Fire.  He also has a Kindle Fire, and I was directed to this particular copy when I did a search for the game plus the term Kindle Fire on Amazon.  Unfortunately, after purchasing it, I have found no way to actually download it to the device, and as stated on the graphic, I can't download it any other way.  We don't have WIFI at home, so I have to go someplace else to download anything at all, so I've spent hours away from home just trying to access my purchase without success.  I wasted my money and I won't be buying any more games through Amazon.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Couldn't be happier!  Our family is a big Doctor Who fan and can't get enough of it.  Don't have cable, so this is the only legit way to watch them.
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|Got this for my son, he loved it of course since he's infatuated with Linkin Park. He used it to download to his IPOD
B000053W01|5.0|What more can one say but the best of the best?  With Richard's arrangements and Karen's voice it was a winning combination never to be repeated.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Cliches..writer demonstrates her lack of depth and imagination ..substandard..I wonder how it became a best seller.power of soft porn I guess..
B00136JS12|5.0|I bought this album because I grew up with this music.  When I saw it for $2.99 I couldn't resist.  The music is upbeat and like being in a concert at home.  This is rock at it's best.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very good novel. Reflection of the atmosphere of the struggle of people living in the political turmoil. And  make people understand what is faith should be, not in God but in people. It is great
B004VMUS9G|2.0|The volume wouldn't work properly. The alarm sounded very low and muffled. It was unsuccessful at waking me up. Wouldn't recommend this to any one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The characters and scenes are not very believable or interesting.  It's not even suitable for young readers because of the mature subject matter.
B0053O89WY|5.0|A friend turned me onto this series and I have loved it!! These young actors do such an excellent job. The scripts are just hilarious and well done. Can't wait to watch the next season.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Awesomely funny also Greg may never get a date in his life LOL!  Sorry if I hurt your feelings (not really) hint hint ;D
1611134226|4.0|This installment of the series was very good. Held my attention for the duration of the cds. I have enjoyed this entire series but requires a good memory to keep track of all the twists and turns.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|iplayed this game before but I forgot what it was like to play. so I decided to. barrow my sisters I phone. now I remember what it is like to play this game.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. It has a great female lead!!! Lots of action. Better plot than alot of action movies. Definitely recommend for anyone wanting a better than average action movie. Tatum Channing is a plus.  Action movie women can relate to as well as men.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the supreme Victorian era program ever made.  I could watch each episode a thousand times and not be bored.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This season has a lot of surprises and changes. The boys are still trying to save the world. Really enjoy the acting and the story line. Very fun show and enjoyable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the app! It lets me watch my favorite TV series, Downton Abbey. I am insanely addicted to the series!
B007L6VR12|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie. It was sweet and campy and just a treat. I always like the work of Norton & McDormand. Willis was a pleasant surprise. Definitely not his usual character & he did a very nice job. Murray was also very good in his part. The kids stole the show, though. Jared Gilman & Kara Hayward were so perfect.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the series an thus app s only way I can watch all series while lying in bed. I ever ave to leave my house to find the DVD.
0938045768|5.0|Author gives nice pep talk about weightless training including some interesting facts about history and origins of calisthenics. Really comprehensive progressions!
B00005NMVP|5.0|when year of the cat came out alll those years ago i loved it then and played it to death. but with passage of time and a few house moves i lost the record.  i heard it on the radio recently and went online to see if if it was still available and was delighted to find that it was available on CD.  Al Stewart has a unique quality of voice and it is still a pleasure listening to it. beats a lot of the trash passed of as music these days. THANK YOU AMAZON!
B002QGSYRC|5.0|Presenting the so called &#34;Korean Conflict&#34; with a precision of a brain surgeon.  A &#34;MUST READ&#34; for anybody interested in modern post WWII HISTORY.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Started Season 1 on Netflix and really fell in love with the show. It's awesome that Amazon Prime has season  2 & 3.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i generally carry 2 or more books with me. this has certainly lighten my load and getting the books was easy. love that i can eve get free books from the library on it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Worth the rent definately, didn't get a chance to see in theatre, enjoyed the movie.  Didn't really know the story so was pleasantly surprised.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|i have always enjoyed all the different versions of this game. only gave it a 4 cause it keeps beating me...lol
B006LSZECO|3.0|Starts out very dull...picks up n the 2nd half.  If I had not been confined to a hospital bed, I probably would have given up!  Some good twists, though!
B007X709PE|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat for 2 hours. Wonderful action footage that shows you what it's really like to be a racer at 200 mph in a sport that not everyone makes it to the finish life of the race or life.<br />I'm not a rider myself, so I didn't think this would be very good so I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the film.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|what else can you say?  the greatest of my time.  as much as i listen to his music it never gets old.  too bad he passed far too young.  cant even imagine what else he could bring to the music/entertainment industry!
B001OSIV62|5.0|Great documentary that I don't think would be possible to pull off today. I wonder where this guy got the money to accomplish this.
B0086221SS|4.0|seemed slow at times, but rather enjoyed seth rogan in a different that usual role for him.  storyline was a bit different...not your standard cookie cutter hollywood film, which is refreshing.
B005ZMUZDU|1.0|One of my favorite movies since I was 12; however, the version available for digital download (which I purchased) is missing several character lines.  If this were a DVD (or even, VHS), I would return it as faulty, but Amazon Digital Library does not appear to have that option.
B006RBZV82|4.0|3D isnt exceptional, but expectations were low.  great footage of underwater sealife.  good commentating by Depp.  would recommend for fish/sea lovers.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|best game I  have played from an app. It is very addictive. I love the way you can rotate the cube and can actually see three sides at  one time.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I rarely write a review on Amazon, but this book was worth the time to do so. I laughed and cried; this is the type of book that you can't wait to get back to. The character development is excellent and the subject matter makes you ponder and think about what you would do in the same situation(s).  The ending was especially impactful.  I can't wait to see what is next from JoJo Moyes......
0545425115|5.0|I bought this because I read the book before and loved it. The movie is great too, so this is a wonderful edition of the book
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|The wife and I are into The Sons series and we wanted to catch the ones we missed, this was just the way to do it.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Saw it in theaters and had to buy it when I saw it for so cheap on Amazon. I recommend this to anyone who likes a good laugh. Plus, the leading males are pretty handsome :)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This is hilarious and the graphics and special effects are awesome.  Addictive, stress relieving, we have been having a ball playing this game.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This was a well thought out plot. Some characters were a bit hard to follow, but on the whole, I liked the book.
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Very intense at the beginning and gets you watching to the last minute.<br />Blu-Ray plays on (A) zone and (B) zone.<br />Denzel and Red haired Both act very true to the story's demands. Great performances by all cast.<br />Very clear, Sound and picture. Can even read time on watch face.<br />Watched it a few times and still more to enjoy. Behind the scenes is also very decent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it going to go see it tomorrow! Can't wait very good story hope the movie stays with the book.
B00170F0WU|4.0|the film was excellent, however I just rented it streaming for a day and the feed got interrupted about a dozen times. this was only a minor inconvenience since it would come back in about 15 seconds, but still a little bit annoying nonetheless.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is awesome and very addictive. me and my husband love playing together and challenging each other. can't put it down
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Great movie. Enjoyed a young lead whose character is likable.  Our family watched this twice in 24 hours and our kids are high schoolers.  Also appreciated Gerard Butler's interpretation of &#34;Frosty&#34;.
B00170M2JY|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever. It really delves into what it's like to be a go-getter and the lessons life presents.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I read the book before seeing the movie and I&#34;m so glad I did. It helped to know and understand the premise of the story by reading the book first. I like the book but I LOVED the movie and can't wait to purchase the DVD,
B001GJ9G90|5.0|I think these two have a great dynamic. I find the movie funny and very entertaining. I recommend it if you've never seen it!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|I've been watching the 007 franchise, series so to speak since Sean Connery. I have always been entertained by them, this one is no exception.
B0053JJLLC|1.0|I can't remember the last time I didn't finish a book, but this one could not keep my interest. The characters were so undeveloped and it seemed like a grown-up version of \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\"!  Crighton has many great books, but this is not one of them.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Good price and a nice quality picture.  The story is wonderful for kids and is entertaining for adults as well.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I have really enjoyed this album.  I normally don't go and buy a whole album anymore but I did this time and don't regret it.
0316228532|1.0|I felt mislead by the description of J.K. Rowling's latest book. Had I known the true content would contain such topics as incest, rape, child abuse, pedaphiles, suicide, explicit drug abuse; all wrapped up in the lives of extraordinarily petty individuals I would never have purchased it. When doing a cursory review on line the topic headings say things like humor and satire? No where in my world do those words cover the above topics. One sight even suggests it for teenagers?  A very disturbing read unless one likes swimming in the underbelly of of very sick individuals lives.
B007MDB71O|4.0|Scientifically Silly but so was the book by today's standards. People that remember the preposterous 50's monster movies and Invasion films will see the fun in this one. Very good CGI, pleasant lead actors, goofy dialogue at times equals a worth while diversion from the more serious issues of daily routine.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it's cool but... you know has awesome stuff like a train and I am new and guess what I got the hang of it.
B000NY12LO|5.0|It is hard to read a story like this that unfortunately is not fiction in our world. This book has opened my eyes and heart to kids like Peter who live with bullying every day and have no way to escape.
B009E3EXMU|4.0|For the hardcore Zep fans.  Love the music, video...not so much.  Page's clothes melting off.  Last live..buy it.<br /><br />Buy it.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Exciting streaming video. Suspenseful and fast moving. Excellent quality.  I recommend it for every conspiracy theory believer and even for those who are not.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this book. Rich in detail and such vivid and fascinating characters. Did not feel like 850 pages. I could have gone another 300 and still been riveted.
B00406O7YK|4.0|Love the movie; the quality is not as good as most but still satisfactory.  no breaks in the streaming but seems pixelated.
B007QUUIEA|5.0|An excellent book, well written and filled with positive life lessons. My kindle is full of clippings from this book and my only complaint is that I wish I'd read it sooner. Wonderful book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun program however I already have completed these on my i Phone so not as exciting as a newer one.  Good action though
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is addicting. You don't even realize it until its too late. I honestly cannot stop playing it. The minitasks make it worthwhile.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The writing is smart, funny, clever, and so entertaining.  The costumes and scenery are amazing.  This is truly a fantastic show!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|We loved it! Never was able to see it in the theater but worth it! Would even watch it again!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Episode 1 is the &#34;best&#34; of the three prequel movies - but they totally ruined an otherwise decent movie with JarJar Binks.  Worst character ever.  I try to put this movie on for my 2yo and she SCREAMS &#34;nooooo!  I want STAR WARS!  NOT THAT!&#34; which of course makes me laugh.  She's a purist just like mommy.  :-)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Fun to play with my grand girls.  It gets them thinking, drawing and being creative, good for the mind !
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|great writing, awesome character development, and engaging plot.  I love every episode in this show, and look forward to the next season.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Other than the raid itself, I thought the movie was slow moving and somewhat boring.  I am not a big fan of this director's work as I thought The Hurt locker was a terrible movie too.  Too much emphasis on the torture scenes - OK got it, Hollywood is against torture.  The hysteronics of Maya to her boss was over the top and would probably have gotten her fired.  I recommend renting this DVD not buying it.
B00003CXCT|5.0|If only Lucas hadn't insisted on going back and editing the original movies.  The new scenes with Jabba &#34;walking&#34; around are horrible, and the clarification on the dead bodies of Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru turn Episode 4 from a perfectly acceptable for kids movie into a &#34;probably need to fast forward that scene&#34; kind of movie.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I think there needs to be a couple other modes.  For example, rather than just one cube how about two cubes or make the cube automatically rotate where you select the axis of rotation and speed?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome business tool.  I use it all the time to track meeting minutes and action item lists.  Works great across multiple phones and devices while still being available on your desktop.
0061537969|5.0|Book  holder holds a thick book and very good for someone with disability. It can also holds kindle, Ipad, etc. Only problem is it seems breakable if it falls on floor.
B005VOXPUC|5.0|My son loves Schleich animals and the elephant family is especially beautifully made. They're much larger in scale compared to the rest of the collection and quite heavy.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I've downloaded twice now. The first few sets of levels were great. I really enjoy the game, but a group of levels named &#34;Hunting&#34; is glitchy and I can't go any further.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Very well written!....moves at a steady pace!  The Acting is superb and is easily the best drama on television today!..........Take A trip to Downton..... you won't be sorry.....Five stars all around!
B006M7JCC2|1.0|It starts out somewhat interesting, but quickly becomes boring and repetitive.  I don't think it's a coincidence that her NDE (if it is even true) reflects many of the beliefs she already held.  I understand the concept of &#34;do not judge lest you be judged&#34;, but to say that saints and people who devote their lives to helping others are no better than mass murderers and baby killers is beyond ridiculous!  Her only answer to why there is physical life is that it is just for &#34;fun&#34;.  And according to her beliefs, life is to be lived without consequence no matter how abhorrent the behavior.  Really??  Give me break.  I do believe that self love (not EGO) is a good thing. In order to help others, we need to first be able to help ourselves.  But, if rubbing elbows with the likes of Charles Manson and Hilter is what awaits me in death, then the afterlife is really going to suck!
0786948523|1.0|We didn't like 4th edition and went back to 3.5.  It seemed more like a board game, less of a role playing game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I lost my data on all games I couldn't bare to start over on them so I went looking for new apps when I found this one and it felt good to game again. This app was my salvation.
0525953728|5.0|Well written story in the life of a seal team.<br /><br />Many thanks to these guys who risk their lives to keep us safe.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|This was a great deal-- all 3 classic films on Blu-ray at a reasonable price.  Picture quality is top notch and if you are looking for a version with multiple language subtitles this is it.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I read this book because I wanted information about the cyber war currently taking place with China. It was interesting the Chinese Military was conducting its attacks out of a 14 story building. It seems Clancy had factual information on some of their operations. The story gave me what I was looking for information on what might happen in the future with our relationship with China. It seems like China is much smarter than us on how they spend their military money. If they have a missiles than can destroy on carriers up to 1000 miles away we should be very careful on how we spend our military money in the future.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Easy to use and works great.  This product was easy and fast to load.  The downloaded documents looked great with good visibility and presentation.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After reading the reviews about these headphones, I purchased them and have been<br />very happy with quality of build and sound. Excellent value for the money relative to other headphones on the market.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|Great sound for these older recordings.  Karajan and his orchestra are well suited for Bruckner.  Maybe the best overall recordings of the complete Bruckner symphonies available.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|There is only one thing to do after reading this book, that is reading the whole series. The killing floor is a brilliant setup to the series Lee Child has created. Jack reacher is an fast thinking problem solver that takes no crap, will leave your body in he's wake and get the girl. He never gets intimidated which makes for fun confrontations with bad guys.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A book to savor and inspire. Pat is so likeable, so human, in his crazy way. I saw the movie first and loved it, but I was not<br />At all disturbed by the changes. Everything just works in both the movie and the book.  Read it and enjoy.
B008N1V11U|5.0|I love this app it is my favorite app on the kindle fire I play it every day when I get home from school.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|good if you like lots of drama.  Very well done.  Very high quality production, and love the cast, and acting.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|For all you budding detectives, this is the book. Much more fun than CSI. I love trying to solve the case along with Sherlock!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|the game is fun and  how often are you offered something for<br />free Good for doctors office, keep kids busy
B000FCKGPC|2.0|It's not just the choice to pluck out the most interesting characters that had thus far driven the plot and made the series, it was the choice to go so deep into detail regarding characters we have little care for. Telling the readers of their clothing, ancestry banner and accomplishments means so little when we have nothing invested in the characters to begin with.  Tis seems a fundamental point Martin missed out on.  It's my hope the series made for television takes this into account.  Is book is droll. If the next is equally droll I will stick with watching TV.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's nothing bad about it to and that's why I played this game all the<br />Time<br />It very fun I love
B007F7QG0Y|1.0|The way he treats his kids, wow, and Anita I feel was F***** up by him. What an ego, working class anti establishment but with no responsibility except Keef. Such a hard guy(sic) but with big tough minders galore to see him through his bullying. He also over rates his musical ability probably due to the abundance of sycophants. I was so surprised by the arrogance of this c***. Sexist, thinks he is black, but no attempt to fight for equality. Keith get a grip, give all your money to people who will make better use of it. Maybe you should try Ryanair and abandon your private jets and give the difference to people who really need it. Keith you Bitch
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was totally engrossing.  It transformed you back to the time and kept you moving through the story till the end. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves history and an epic soga of life.  I had hoped it would end a little more on an up beat note but in life not everything does so it only made the story more enjoyable
1401219268|5.0|Usually not much into comic books but this comic has a more realistic feel on things and you end up really liking the characters. Perhaps it could teach a few of you guys a thing or two as well.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This is exactly what this camera needs. Manual cap was too fussy. This one's a snap. Adds very little bulk.
1616551615|5.0|I must say it is beautiful in all its glory, something to hold onto until the day comes to pass it onto the kids.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I haven't bought a cd in ages and now in the last month I have bought two. This was one of them and I'm not disappointed. She has an awesome voice!
0385040253|5.0|What can I say I was looking for the best book of Knots and I was turned to this book.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|I hate the plot where you have to play as two people one a US solider the other a terrorist<br />I like to not have two personalities in a game
B00881VLCE|5.0|I absolutely love this and will be recommending it to my daughter. The options for picking how many puzzle pieces will allow me to share this with my 5 year old grandson as well as challenge me. This is fantastic,thank you. The only sort of strange thing was that I could hear the background musiceven after I had exited the app. Not really a problem. Just strange....  But it stopped now. Smiles.
B0091THDOM|5.0|I brought this case about a month ago to protect my phone while in my back pack during school. The case is stern, decent looking, and you can still access your phone quickly by simply by pulling the attachment on the back. People with the negative reviews probably don't know what the attachment on the back is for plus if you're spending $10 don't expect best case, I received exactly what I expected nothing more/less.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses you will love this game you get to take care of your own horse<br />you also get to buy more horses
B0000028RR|5.0|really like the CD!  just what we have been looking for for a while, not the re-pop or cover versions.  great item!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put the book down. looking for more to read from E.L.James.<br />also read 50 Shades and read book three.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I have never read a book in two days but Wild consumed me and I did just that.  Great discussion followed in my book club.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Book one . Book two. Book three.  recordmened to everyone.Even if you don't like reading. I really enjoyed so very much.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This is for my little grandson..He is happy with it and has gotten me hooked as well! Blast it! Hey it is fun for adults too.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|This works well. Downloaded for Android phone and computer. Now I have access to my pictures on the phone and computer.
B008OOYALE|5.0|more interactive than some of the other games from this company. my daughter really likes playing. only downside is that manyof the cool dragons aren't available with coins.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very nice calculator. Beats the one included on my Samsung SPH-D710. I highly recommend dowloading this calculator. Clean look and operation and best of all it is free.
0984183523|5.0|C a se Interview Secrets: A Former McKinsey Interviewer Reveals How to Multiple Job Offers in Consulting Companies<br /><br />Love it!
B0011Z3334|5.0|One of my favorites! I owned this album a long time ago and then lost it. It was nice to re-live the songs again.
B00899F0G8|5.0|The only problem I have is that I have to wait a whole week for a new episode! Thanks Amazon Instant and Amazon Kindle!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was a good read but not one of my favorites. Most likely because I couldn't \\"like\\" either of the two main characters. However, I did feel that Flynn made some great underlying points about relationships and marriage. Good book for a book club.
B00BESIKWM|2.0|Real short review.  It felt like everything was just happening.  The character barely had to do anything, everything was being done for her.  The bad guys forced her to go to Silent Hill, someone else drove her there, she had an invincible protector, she did not even have to fight anything in any way.  So no, I feel it fails as a sequel especially given that it comes from a series of games that make the player work for it!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game, however you can get to points where there is nothing to do but wait to gain more coins and rewards unless you want to spend money.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I loved this book. There were so many ideas and angles presented for further thought and exploration by the imagination of the reader. It was a page-turner, I really did not know what was coming next. Brilliant.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is really good especially if you don't like walking up to that annoying beeping sound, you can play your own music instead.!!!!!
B004BSFC46|4.0|The products are smaller than I expected.  However they are cute anyhow, and considering they are for babies anyway, I am happy with them, especially with the rattles when shaken.  They will make a ok presents.
B008S8PPPG|4.0|I generally am a little wary trying new artists but after a few youtube searches, and a pitchfork review, I decided to buy this album for my husband for christmas. Jessie has an interesting mix of sounds and some are slower--but not so slow they lull you to sleep. I found her released hits from the UK to be really nice and upbeat. Her video's are a little 1980's dance inspired...but if you can get past that you'll be in for a treat. Besides, we can't just listen to Adele forever in the US--there are lots of other interesting artists over there and she's definitely one of them.
0399157565|2.0|Maybe it's just me, but the book seemed to be written in a dialogue of what Kay was thinking - and she was always hearing some hidden agenda.  It was aggravating.  There would be a conversation and Kay would be thinking \\"but she's really asking me if she can have an affair with my husband\\" - really?  Everything had a second meaning and I just found it distracting that there was this other conversation always taking place.  I found it difficult to complete.
1439192812|5.0|Dawkins is the premier spokes men for scientific inquiry rather than blind faith.  His explanation of natural phenomenon is down-to-earth and should be intelligible to all.  Having said that, someone with a  science education my find his explanations too simplified.  However, Dawkins is not aiming the book at the choir.  Great book and I recommend it highly.
080214473X|5.0|This was an awesome read.  The book is more about the operation than the politics (although that is covered as well).  You really feel like you are on the ground with these guys.  I've watched the movie a million times, but the book blows it away.  The movie does a great job of following the book - but there are just so many more details in the book and the context much more robust.  I found it a little confusing figuring out where they teams were at.  There are some maps in the book, but I still got confused - but I get lost in my own house.  This was a serious engagement and these men fought courageously and with great skill.  It is simply amazing that they made it out alive.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is very realistic. The only flaw is that the screen can go black for a couple minutes. I love the game.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and found the book to be even more enjoyable.  As with most books, the plot is actually a bit more intricate and complex, which was an added bonus.  I like the style of writing and there was always something going on that would keep you hooked.  This is a great book.
B00ABKGG0C|3.0|The very first sentence of this book made me cringe. It's abominable. Thankfully, the book improved greatly from there. The setting and plot  were (mostly) original and the author avoided the purple prose favoured by too many fantasy authors.<br /><br />Aside from a few editing mistakes, I feel that it's greatest defects lay in some of the structuring. A few of the flashbacks and sudden changes in chronology were jarring, and that the pacing deteriorated in the latter third of the book. The story itself suffered a little from having a super-human protagonist and a cryptic antagonist whose position is exposed in a rather dreary monologue reminiscent of a Bond-Villain's.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend it as an original read and a promising start to a series. If, with experience in his craft Anthony Ryan improves, his later works will certainly be on my to-read list.
1780387105|5.0|The songs are not necessarily the same as the original song and are designed to help you with basic chord changes while providing fun song melodies.  I think this is an awesome book for that purpose.  If you are looking for a song book that shows you exactly how to play a song, this is not for you.  The variety of songs is good, so there is something for everyone.  What I especially like is that since the songs are simplified and only use the chords that correspond with the various lessons online or in his book, you can start applying them to familiar melodies without getting frustrated trying to play chords or embellishments that are for more advanced players.<br /><br />I will probably buy his other songs books and will definitely purchase more of his lesson material (even though a lot of it is free online, I like having books too and DVD's are just simply a better quality than streaming video).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good and i like the skins that they have.The mystery box gave me 2004 coins man this game is good
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think this was a fantastic book. It has the perfect amount of action and adventure and just the right amount of romance. I recommend this book to any Twilight Saga fans.
B003UYUP5I|4.0|This book is very funny. A good Reading when you  have nothing to do, especially after seeing How I Met Your Mother
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|after about 2 weeks it just completely stopped working, it wouldn't open at all, just kept going to the main screen once I tapped/clicked on it
0345803507|2.0|married and kids? boring!! thats what everybody does. Would have been more fun with out that domestic stuff added in
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best rated cable tv show for a reason! Every episode satisfies the previous cliff hanger but leaves you with another. Great show!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am only reading this book at the moment but it is a great advantage to have it on my phone as I can read it at anytime
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Good story telling, dark drama, and a bit graphic. Not for everyone but highly entertaining. Unpredictable and original.<br /><br />I suggest you watch it from episode 1 so you can watch the characters grow and the storyline will also make more sense.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|its like any other stupid game. its lost is originality. there to much details in the game ya don't know Wat's gonna happen next. and this app is really slow its copied from other games like the cart ride ,that part of the game was copied from this Penguin game from disney
B005LAIHQS|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time.  Lots of action, good acting and a great story line!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved these books and have re-read them a number of times now. Definitely a good buy and worth the read.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|So easy to use i love this but it is dangerous spending more dollars i do save first than purchase great way to buy
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Very protective, slim, functional case. I bought this for my mother and she is very pleased with it. Five star product.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|Possibly I misread the info on the book, but it clearly it fell well bellow my expectations. Don't bother buying it.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We love Game of Thones! We don't have cable or any premium cable packages so we wait to buy the seasons when they come out on DVD. We're going to try not to watch the whole season this weekend...
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Very good book to read and re-read many times if you wish to better your presentation skills, and/or better understand what makes good presentations tick. Jobs was a master and author tells you why and how.<br />Good examples, very practical.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Can't wait to read #2!  One of the best books I have read in a very long time.  History lesson also.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The author does a wonderful job of taking a small vacation/shore-living paradise, with its apparently tranquil neighbors and public servants, and transforms it into a background hiding terrible activities you would never connect to this place. Excellent Baldacci!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'm not the biggest Stephen King fan but this was great. Was worried how he was going to end it, and I think it could have been better in the end, but it was a great read and I'd suggest it to anybody.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Nelson DeMille can do muuuch better than this book. &#34;The Lion's Game&#34; is my standard for DeMille, and this book, though it promises similar levels of  action, twists, and turns, comes out flat in comparison. The great John Corey lines and some good characters that accompany him, as well as an interesting - though overly tainted - view of Yemen give it an Ok for me.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|I love Bruckner and have collected many, many recordings over the years: Furtwangler (my fav), Kanappertsbusch, Karajan, Wand, Jochum, Walter, Bohm, the list goes on and on. Of course I'd heard about Celibidache but it always seemed a little bit of a cult thing, a little too \\"out there\\" for a serious music lover (and musician) to take seriously. Well, long story short I felt like I needed something new, was intrigued by the samples from this box set,  and took the plunge. And all I can say is now I'm a believer too. This is some of the most spellbinding music I've ever heard. It isn't that I heard things I never heard before, but I heard them like I've never heard before. The fourth symphony glows with a warm soft inner light. The gigantic formal architecture of the fifth is laid out in a cathedral of sound. The seventh is thrilling both in its loudness and quietness. Everyone knows how slow the tempi are, and I know it's a cliche (the very cliche that had me keeping Celibidache at arms length all these years) but I sure didn't notice, I was swept up in the music. It is truly amazing, but every phrase takes on a life of its own. These performances are very different from Furtwangler's, but they both have this in common for me: their performances have me hanging on every note, and when the symphony is over my overwhelming feeling is it was much too short. Which is quite a trick for a Bruckner symphony.    A few other points. The sound is fantastic, and very lifelike. The playing of the Munich Philharmonic is very lifelike too, if that makes any sense. These are live performances, and while they don't have the shear mechanical perfection of e.g. the Berlin Philharmonic in the studio, they are very well played and more importantly very well felt. These recordings capture the gestalt of a live performance as well as I've ever heard it recorded.    I wouldn't choose this set for an introduction to Bruckner. But if you know and love Bruckner and want to hear it taken to the next level Celibidache and the Munich Philharmonic may very well be just your ticket.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. Nicholas Sparks books are usually sad, but this one was a happy cry. Way better than the movie too.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|Tried different tennis games but this one is the best.  Like the fast pace of the game even though the players all have the same cartoonist face.
B00457WZEI|4.0|WAR HORSE was a good book that I would recommend to people who love war books. This book was alright.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Well written .  Colorful , sympathetic characters. Keeps you turning the pages, wanting more up to the very end. GOOD FIRST NOVEL. Look forward to future works.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|The movie was OK.  Maybe all the hype had my expectations set high.  Skyfall did not keep me interested.  I wanted to go to sleep. Don't get me wrong, acting was great, story was good but something was missing.
159420411X|4.0|Nate Silver cruises through a family of diverse topics from sports to business to climate change and politics, with enough detail to satisfy the technically inclined without going too far for the general reader (although some might disagree on that last point). He never seems out of his league, with perhaps the closest to that coming to the emphasis on Bayes' theorem when a different perspective might have been a better fit. Even so, his explanation of Bayes' work is reasonable, and credit goes to him for bringing the concepts to a wider audience.<br /><br />Some of the topics dragged a bit, and different readers may feel the same about different subjects depending on their interests. One of the interesting conclusions following his original rise to fame is that the baseball scenario has now reached its logical maturity, or at least a plateau where only marginal gains are feasible. Everybody has basically the same data and there is too much human unpredictability left to achieve a predictable edge.<br /><br />Regarding why some predictions fail, Silver does give a treatment to trying to ferret out the real data from noise or from reasonable variation in the sample data. For example we all hear about a single bad storm or extreme season as justification for one conclusion or another about climate change. Silver is downright calm and rational in his assessment.<br /><br />I was entertained by his dip into poker, especially his eventual conclusion about market shifts when the online rules changed and who was a &#34;fish&#34;. Wait, am I the fish? Oops. This isn't the best example of signal vs. noise, but close enough!<br /><br />Finally, I always thought &#34;unknown unknowns&#34; was a solid concept, despite its political ridicule. Silver gave it a fair shake.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it was awesome I mean I could play it everyday and whoever hares is stupid because its amazing you I hope everyone will buy it
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story.  Edge of your seat read about the horrors of abuse inflicted upon a woman whose love turned into a nightmare of trying to survive and escape from her unstable, brutal husband.  Encouraging to follow her as she makes a new life for herself and the peril that follows her.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a really addictive game but something I really like is the mystery boxes whatever is in there is very helpful through out the game.
B000I3PA8Q|4.0|This is one of the better Star Trek movies with the original cast in my opinion.  The movie takes a comedic approach to conservationism.  The movie is old so I don't consider this a spoiler, putting the characters in the then modern world created many funny moments.  If you enjoy the Star Trek universe this is a must see movie.
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Wow.  I'm totally blown away by this album.  I have nothing to compare it to as this is the first Nick Cave album that I've purchased. The songwriting and performance are awesome.  The musicians, production/arrangements are over the top.  I like the &#34;sparseness&#34; of the arrangements yet the production really makes it big in a subtle way.  I also like the fact that it has a &#34;laid back&#34; groove so you can put it on to relax and &#34;chill&#34; to for sure. Love it!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I don't know about other fans/viewers for the show. But last like 2-4 episodes seem like disappointing filler episodes almost. Least for season 1 and 2 if I recall, least each episode seem to have a purpose of some sort. I just home last like 2 episodes something crazy happens.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|This one is tough. I was initially drawn to the Soviet historical angle, but not what I had expected. Author seems very talented, but ultimate subject matter for this one made me uncomfortable. Sometimes fiction crosses that line.  Nevertheless, if into crime serials and Stalin era politics, might enjoy.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a giood game its fun to play the only thing I don't like is that you can't make everything On pocket edition that you can in real minecraft which is why I don't like it as much as I do survivalcraft because you can't make like anything if I made this game I would make it where you can build more stuff that's why it got only 3 stars and not 5 it like never gets updates either so I don't think its that good but its not that bad of a game its just that its not quite the best it could be :/
B007V65R54|2.0|Not as good as I had wanted it to be. I thought it would be more about his elections predictions and the politics involved. For pretty esoteric regarding climate and environmental stuff.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely love it! Nicholas Sparks does it again. He makes you feel like you're there experiencing everything first hand. I couldn't put it down!
B007REV4YI|4.0|This movie was full of action and the usual Bond stuff.  Loved the throwback cars from the previous bond films.  A nice action film, I guess I wanted more from all the hype that came before it came out.
0385341008|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. After I read it, I gave it to my grandmother, who also loved it. It was great to get to learn about the history of the occupation of Guernsey during WWII, which I knew nothing about. I also love books that are non-traditional, and this was definitely non-traditional in that the whole book is written as a series of letters. I did find the characters confusing, especially at first, but I actually kept a brief list so that I could keep track of who was who, and that helped a lot. It was a fast read, which was good because I couldn't put it down.

B0070UFMOW|4.0|It's my opinion that the power draw for headphones is something that's grossly overstated in general. On many of the hi-fi forums, you'll see new users asking for headphone advice and people giving suggestions, and then you have people complaining about certain aspects of their headphones, to which the normal reply is to tell them to get an amp to drive them properly.<br /><br />Stop it. That's not what's going on here, not in the slightest. Some people just don't like certain headphones.<br /><br />But there are plenty of headphones out there that do benefit from amping to some extent, and Fiio fills an important niche of pushing just about any mid-fi headphone to its potential. The E17 is no exception.<br /><br />I bought it, initially, just because I saw it on sale. I didn't have a portable setup, and I didn't have headphones that particularly required amping. I found that the EQ options (the bass and treble adjustments) worked very well on a lot of my low impedance headphones that helped me enjoy them more. I was able to take something like my Brainwavz BW IEMs, maintain the clarity of them, but boost the bass up a little bit and narrow the treble to reduce the tinny-ness. I got the sound I wanted, and it made my UE 900 totally superfluous.<br /><br />So I sold the UE 900 and bought the Hifiman HE-400 Planar Magnetic headphones. Now, as far as planars go, the HE-400 are among the most efficient. I used the E17 to drive them and I was able to get to satisfactory listening volumes and if the E17 was the only device I used from then on, I would have been very happy.<br /><br />I did eventually purchase a Schiit Magni and Modi, and found that while the HE-400 don't require more power, they certainly love it, because the Magni really opened up the sound and the E17 felt \\"muddy\\" in comparison. That said, that's at the top end of the E17 spectrum.<br /><br />I now use the E17 as my bedroom rig paired with a Sennheiser HD-595. It sounds great and a slight bump to the bass (+2) makes me incredibly happy. It drives the 595 flawlessly, and works well with my two IEMs of choice - the Brainwavz B2 and Monster Miles Davis Trumpet.<br /><br />I also purchased the Fiio L7 so I can bypass the E17's amp and use it just as a DAC. Results, when paired with my Schiit Magni and Little Dot MKIII tube amp were more than satisfactory.<br /><br />All in all, it's a handsome little device that packs plenty of power for everything from low to mid-fi and doesn't totally fail at driving things higher up like the HE-500.<br /><br />Pros: Lightweight, very sturdy, strong EQ options<br />Cons: Battery is so-so, buttons aren't easy to pushss (+2) makes me incredibly happy.

B0072OFOM6|5.0|My wife and I were both wondering how the season could possibly continue after the fall of the Batiatus Ludus.  The writers did a great job keeping us glued to the series.  We can't watch the show week to week so we just get the BluRays and make a marathon of the season.  One weekend and this set was complete.  Now we are anxiously awaiting the release of War of the Damned after the season is completed.

B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love watching this TV series and when ever I miss the premier on TV I download it on to my Kindle Fire to watch.
B005LAIHZE|2.0|I bought this movie after my sister recommended it.  I love vampire movies and while they tried to take the vampire legend in a different direction, I didn't like that direction at all.  Sometimes a weak story is over powered by so much special effects and CGI.  That happened here.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|I almost mistaken Craig for a cyborg running around like a video game. Dialog is dry, predictable and looks like no more than going through the motion. There is no suspense, imagination or anything that resembles the Bond of old.
B005LAIHQS|2.0|I thought this movie had a lot of potential but it is another case of the special effects and CGI being more important than the story line.  I thought it was kind of boring.
B0091LS07E|5.0|She's excellent and brilliant and the lyrics are so soothing to the soul. Not to mention the music itself, which is Alicia Keys at her best.  I would highly recommend this CD to help relax you after a long day as well as prepare you for a hectic day ahead! You won't regret her harmonious melodies and soulful lyrics.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a 3D mojang game where you swipe to rotate the cove to find the matching piece. It's innovative and well made. The pieces are frustrating at times and hard to look at. If the art was a little more appealing this would be a five star for me. A good example of how it could look better would be a similar app that looks a ton better: [[ASIN:B004Z1LB76 Fairy Mahjong 3D - Ad Free]].

B00AQCMK32|5.0|I've been playing this game on Android for well over a year. It's the only game that is on every one of my phones (Droid 2, Galaxy S3, Galaxy Nexus, Droid Razr Maxx) and every one of my tablets (rooted Nook Color, Xyboard 10, Galaxy 7). I go back to it every week and once you start playing you can't stop!<br /><br />First, it should be known that Kairosoft has basically two types of games: building sims, where you have a ship, mall, spa and have to build it up and gain customers, unlocking more complex scenery and buildings and games like this one, where you are the owner/ manager of a company building up your company, hiring employees, determining which way to build on an RPG tech tree and level up your employees. This game is one of the later types. **Note: trials of all these Kairosoft games are available from Google Play. So if you are wondering which ones to get, check them out their first.**<br /><br />Here you start with a small software company in the 80s (it doesn't say the year but the game progesses for 20 years and moves from PC to game systems that are oddly spelled versions of the real systems that came out in the correct order), and hiring 4 employees to create software games. You pick the genre of the game, the type of game (like High School Online RPG, for instance) and then use your employees to write the script, do graphics and sound. Your employees have skill points for each of these categories and rank up as you train or level them up. You can hire and fire employees and change their jobs. Ultimately, you can rank up an employee to the point where you can develop your own system! Then you game goes on sale and you watch it's earnings and rank. (You can by advertising and build your customer base as well.) Later you are up for yearly awards, which builds your customer base. Yes, you also get to go to the gaming convention! And that's just the first couple years.<br /><br />The depth here is unrivaled in Android games. It really is an amazing game. As a gamer, this game is a blast.<br /><br />No pesky permissions, no IAP, and no social networking pop ups..

B00ATPVA78|5.0|Great game, fun for the day. Great graphics, make the wedding turn out right and Save a friend. Nothing better.
B004ZA9HB4|3.0|Most of the newer Smartphones already have AllShare, DLNA and other similar tech that allows you to play your phone content on TVs with the tech also built in to them. This app has a nice preloaded selection of stations, but it is redundant.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an enspiring, story of survival and a must read. Never a dull moment and a great twist at the end. Well written and exciting throughout.<br />Loved it!
B007N9FKCY|4.0|This is a well made, fun game where you guide a bouncing bean through a level after level filled with dangers and collectibles. It is well made, with excellent retro graphics and easy to learn but challenging enough to keep you interesting. Four stars because there are just so many of these platformer games that I found I just didn't find enough here to keep coming back. To summarize: well made, fun, but one of many, many really good Android platformers.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|The closest thing to Mario I've found for the Kindle Fire. The insects and the pine cones are a little lame but it's still a really fun game to play. I definitely recommend it for everyone. #Skeetinhermouth
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Binge-viewed all three seasons. Never before have found such a series so compelling. The historical insights were fascinating. Outstanding script, acting, character development, sets, costumes - all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  I did see the movie first and I liked it too.  This is the first book I have read by this author.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I beloved that subway suffers is the best game ever since I played the game ive had the most awesomes expiriance wet
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book was better than the first.  The ending did leave you hanging and wanting to read the third one.
B004EPZ084|3.0|I watched this movie in a theater and quite liked it.<br />I never expect to buy it in a DVD or a Bluray but I did.<br />It has some crude humor and I like it that way.<br />The way how three men end with revenge their boses, I didn't liked.<br />But above all, worth enjoying.<br />Just a time killing comedy I guess.<br />The picture quality is soso. Experior night scenes, a lot of grains I can see. But it's a DVD after all.
B004DARF6A|5.0|Screened this movie for my 8th Graders at the end of a unit after a test. They absolutely loved it. You know it's a good movie when 13 year olds yell at you not to turn it off when the bell rings.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Such a great book series. I hate that it came to an end. Look forward to reading more books by this author.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My twin (girls age 3.5 years) and my boys (age 6 and age 9) love this movie.  They have watched it over and over and over and over again!  They are finally giving it a break now.  It is; however, good enough of a movie that you don't get sick of it the first 10 or 12 times, especially if you are at the point where you are checking in on the kids everyone once in a while and don't see the whole movie every time.<br /><br />Love that Craig Ferguson is on it!  Wish he had a bigger part!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|My husband got me hooked on Downton Abby and I was so happy to get the Blue Ray....love watching it!!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Loved it on my Kindle and hope to find more I like as well. Great way to spend time reading.
B009EDZGY4|5.0|Kept my kids very entertained!  They have watched it several times.  They enjoy all of the Ice Age movies.  Will watch again.
030716327X|4.0|Fantastic book that spans generations. Read it to our kids and now we look forward to reading it with our grand children
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I felt like the best in the trilogy was &#34;Batman Begins&#34;.  It went continually down after that movie.  This one seemed to build and then everything fell apart at the end.  It felt like they didn't know how to end it.  Too many loose ends for my taste.
B001CDLATE|4.0|This is my first experience with this genre of movies.  The images are absolutely gorgeous in detail and composition.  I do wish that locations of the different scenes were identified.  For many scenes, I could only speculate as to where they had been filmed.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|The movie easily gets you in.  It starts quickly and takes you into a world.  All the foreshadowing is not too overt.  This one I liked because it tied up most of the loose ends.
B00633W614|5.0|I love Jeffry Archer, and this trilogy (of which I've read two of the three) has been beyond my expectations.  The twists and turns of the plot kept me interested,and I can't wait until the third book is released!!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is exactly what I wanted.  It was an action movie that did not disappoint.  It was able to draw you into the character's universe quickly and then kept going.  It did leave an opening for another movie.  Kind of like Die Hard series for me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok I love the game but I would like to see minecarts in the game and maybe an update that lets you gets mods

B004M8S3Y6|4.0|The 4-Hour Body is an interesting book filled with useful tips and tricks to achieve different results and reach certain goals. The methods might sometimes be somewhat unorthodox, and Ferris attempts and methods to understand physical and psychological mechanisms certainly borderlines on what I would consider &#34;sane&#34;. At the same time the methods he uses able him to drill down and isolate the essence of each subject and maximise result with the least effort. Ferris is surely an experiment of one, and with that, others don't have to. I'm happy I read the book and I would recommend anyone with interest in any of the subjects to read it. There's so much to learn from this book.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|if you love animals and would like a digital pet give this one a try. the price is right. FREE!! its simple enough for kids and interesting enough for adults. I really love my new horse. I give it 4. 1/2 stars. it would rate a 5 if store items were a little less expensive.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Its relatively quiet and moves air well. A bit large though, this definitely NOT for any smaller or crowded case. The size is why it got 4 stars
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best creating game I've ever played I love to create stuff this is the best game get minecraft pe... psst don't get skin stealers for minecraft.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|My husband just loved this movie. He watched it twice in one day. Exactly as described. I thought it pretty good as well
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Interesting parallel to the happens of the time. Shows great development of where BM was to where he ended. Thought Anne Hathaway did a great job. Great twist at the end.
B000JIHP88|5.0|This is such a nice mobile. I am very happy with this purchase. I wish I had this hen my daughter was a newborn. The music is very nice. The overall quality is excellent!
B009FZFONO|5.0|For the most part it has good acting. I don't like that they separated one season so far apart just to make it end so soon. Then having to wait for season four, likely till sep.
0062082353|5.0|A real trajedy! ( his death) One of the best books I have ever read. Chris was a true hero! Highly recommend!

B008YWY0HK|5.0|A very good movie about a brave girl who learns some tough life lessons. Animated. Very good animation. :) Thanks
1596680296|4.0|I thought that this book would give the same as others; several different pattern ideas. It did, but it gave more than that. Ann Budd breaks down the construction and gives it to you in a way that you could construct your own sock pattern if you wanted to. I like this book and will continue to refer to it often
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Really good game.  I think this game is amazing and pretty scary.  When I played farm he would teleport right infront of me lots on day.  Just a sugjestion, could you ad multiplayer, running, and a mode where you try and get into a safehouse and the game will not end untill all players are in the safehouse?  If not that is ok.  Thank you. Love the game.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to come out!! One of my favorites and highly recommend this movie to anyone. Especially comic fans.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I find this game fun,  entertaining, challenging, and addictive. I didn't play the first Temple Run so can't compare it. Try it...you might like it!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I liked this movie much better than the first one. Good story, good twist at the end. And lets face it Robert Downey Jr is hot!
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|The game was really fun for a few weeks until it constantly crashed and never completed actions. It was fun while it worked well though.
1476715904|5.0|I LOVED this book. Couldn't put it down. Its definitley a tear jerker with a romantic twist. I highly recommend this book.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I play this game for hours on end. It's literally like you're a governor of a town and you have to keep the residents happy. I've expanded my town to fill the entire map. I love the new update, where you can hunt deer. I would like the next update to be so you can trap the rabbits, because it's annoying to have them hopping around your town. Overall, a great game for all ages.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved it. Definitely a quick read.  It somehow reminded me of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and Mommy Dearest.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I hate to have anything in my ear, so the bluetooth speaker is a great alternative to a headset.  This sounds fantastic and the noise-cancellatin technology really makes a difference.  It actually sounds clearer than listening directly on the phone. My sister bought one once she saw how great this works.  Much safer way to manage conversations on the road.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|charming read, best done in one sitting! Only wish it had been longer, would have happily spent all weekend curled up with the Rosie project.
B005PR44XC|4.0|This is the second Lewis book I have read. He has the ability to make complicated issue simple to understand. Can Australia learn anything from the US?
B00008G8M4|5.0|Of course I love the movie, everytime I watch it.<br />The only problem it had a glitch in the middle but for the price I could live with that.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|'Harold' keep popping up on my book radar. Then it was chosen by my book club. It was a delightful read about life and the English way. Having spent a long time in the UK it was nice to remember their quirkiness.
B00B19F3PG|4.0|Most horror shows of today are based blood and gore<br />it seems.Not so much in this flick.It is refreshing that this wasn't.<br />This movie (though a little slow at  the start) has a great creep factor<br />to it .I thought it was was well written and has great acting.<br /> I will watch again.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|What a great finish to the series, or should I say beginning?<br />I'm so glad dashner chose new characters, but still tied it to the rest of the series at the end.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just when you though it couldn't get any better it does.<br />Great acting, writing and story line make this series<br />an instance classic.
0062202081|4.0|Justin's story is interesting, if nothing else. Going from a Youtube sensation to an international rock star, is no easy feat. And though he had help along the way, he seems to be handling it ok. His book tells HIS story HIS way. So, it might be the best look at Justin's thoughts and ride to fame. Interesting, I found a mention on one of his fansites of [[ASIN:1475937148 Lady Lawbreaker]].<br /><br />With a career full of promise, Justin's book is worth its four stars.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This film has great chase scenes in it and everything you would expect from James Bond.  Action and Suspense.  It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole film.  One of the best Bond films I had ever scene.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I have never been good at this sort of game so bought this intentionally to try to improve in this area. I have not played it a lot but find it challenging and well worth the money.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I can't stand JRPG's, but this game be one of the best reasons to own a Vita.<br />Go buy it. Now.
B00838HSYM|5.0|It is what it is.  Pinocchio is one of Walt Disney's true classics and inspired by the great man himself.  It is a timeless tale and far surpasses some of the tripe coming out of the studios today, come on, Wreck It Ralph?  The Blue Ray version of Pinocchio is fantastic and inspiring.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Awesome game. I really enjoyed it. The graphics are good and the story kept me entertained. So far I have been really impressed with G5.
B008220C56|5.0|There have been many adaptations of Anna Karenina and I am sure this not the last time we will see Leo Tolstoy's novel be adapted for television or the cinema. Joe Wright's film in my opinion is the most interesting adaptation of the novel and also one of the best in my opinion. Set in a theater this adaptation reminded me of Moulin Rouge. The film is visually interesting. The sets are beautiful and the costumes are lovely. Keira Knightley is not exactly as Tolstoy described her but she is none the less very good. Knightley is one of my favorite actresses working today and as Anna she is heart breaking and she luminous. She is not a afraid to make Anna a flawed woman, which she is very much so. Anna can be very unlikeable she is not a saint and we sometimes don't take her side but I think Keira realized that Anna was a complex character she is not a hero but not a villain. Jude law as Anna's Husband is great. His character is not a monster at all. He is a man who is very moral and fights for what he thinks is morally  correct. He loves Anna and it's obvious he values his role as a husband and father. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is not as bad as many people say as he is in his role. He is not great but he is not so bad. The supporting cast is wonderful especially Kelly Macdonald as Anna's sister in law.  Anna Karenina is not your standard costume drama. It is bold and unconventional and at times over the top and very theatrical. This is not your standard adaptation of a classic novel it is bold and fresh.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Christopher Eccleston was the perfect Doctor for the reboot of the series.  Troubled and lonely, he finds the perfect companion in Rose, who challenges him to look at the world with more compassion.  If you are new to Who, you owe it to yourself to get to know the Ninth Doctor.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|The Kill Order was a fantastic prequel. I was a bit worried that I would not like this book as much as I enjoyed the rest of the series. It ended up being better than I could have imagined. I could hardly put this book down.  It was so intense
B005FFW46S|4.0|If you like Terry Pratchett this book is right up your alley.  If you haven't read Terry Pratchett then this probably isn't the best book to  start with as it builds on past books somewhat.  Sam Vimes is the main driving character here.  Not a terrific book, but solid.<br /><br />The Kindle app makes the frequent footnotes very annoying.  You click on the footnote and it takes you to a separate page at the very end of the book.  Then you can't click back.  So you have to go find your place again manually.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|Love theses guys! I can't  wait to see them live this summer.  I have two of their albums and getting more!

B000FCKGPC|2.0|I have enjoyed the first three books. This book lost me midway. I keep going back to it hoping the further along I get I will become more interested in the storyline.
0765322889|4.0|I am a total beginner to this series. When I started the book, I was absolutely overwhelmed by the people and places and magic and gods - many of which are referenced incidentally, without explanation. A few hundred pages in, and I felt pretty comfortable with the main characters, I had a much better understanding of the way that magic worked, and I found the story very compelling. I appreciate that Erikson trusts his readers to figure things out without dense paragraphs of history and descriptions, which would have dragged the story down (although so many things were happening in so many places that much of the world seemed like a blur to me, there are some lovely, elegant descriptions of architecture, creatures, myths, and so on). As it is, the story moves very quickly, jumping from tense moment to tense moment.<br /><br />I often felt that the characters did things because they were supposed to, or because it was convenient, but not because it made sense to them as individuals (except for Kruppe, who was maybe my favorite). Several times the characters ask themselves, why am I doing this? What does this accomplish, and do I feel good about that? and often leave their questions unanswered, choosing to simply forge ahead without any clear understanding of their own beliefs or actions. If the character doesn't know why they're doing something, why do they keep doing it? And why would they just start to question these things now, when they seem to have been at war forever? Has nothing that made them feel conflicted ever happened before? I felt that I didn't really understand why anything was happening other than that it had to, in order for the different arcs to converge in one particular place for a big fancy battle. But: I think this is an unhelpful complaint, because addressing it would mean slowing down the narrative for lectures or getting rid of some of the characters, and that would produce different (probably duller) books.<br /><br />In all, I enjoyed this book a lot and I intend to read the whole series. It is a bit intimidating for a first-time reader, but figuring things out is rewarding, and the world is rich and colorful.ook a lot and I intend to read the whole series.

B0097GVJWQ|3.0|I really like this game, good story line, great graphics, no hold-ups. BUT i played the free game, then paid for the full game, IT WAS THE EXACT SAME GAME! Nothing extra, does not go further. The game ends in the exact same place. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! LIKE I DID.

B002SAUCBC|3.0|Although I do like reading King's work, this one was too depressing for me; but I still could not put it down!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Truly a great series. Will enjoy the entire set again and look forward to Season 4. The production is true to the times. The characters are excellent in each role. Well done Downton Abbey!
1439153663|3.0|Great literature?  No.  Compelling story?  Yes.  I would not have chosen this on my own, but it was my book group's pick.  It was a page turner, but I had no problem scanning over paragraphs to get to important events.  I never do this when the writing is too beautiful to skip over.  So, if you are looking for a page turner, then I would choose this.  If you are hoping for breathtaking prose, then pass.
B0082A3HTQ|4.0|If you loved the movie, you will love having this CD to remind you of it. Makes me happy every time I listen to it.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A heart warming story.  Learned about the war; learned about a code of conduct in the German air force I had never read about before.  Very interesting to view the war through the eyes of a German fighter.  Nice to read about something good happening during a time where evil reigned.

B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a terrible time in history with the breaking up of families and the deaths of many.  This book describes the life of one family and how their lives intertwine with the history of another.  I really enjoyed this book.
0143142356|3.0|While it is a book that consistently holds your interest, it is too similar to the first book in the series, Pillars of the Earth, to be as good. It was too repetitive, and at times it felt as if it was the same book, same theme, same plot, with only the names and dates changed. It takes place in the same part of the world, the characters, descendants of those in the first, are always in the same circumstances of danger or mystery as they were in the first book. Their problems are still insoluble.<br />Wantonness in the area was rife, outlaws lived without fear, murder often went unnoticed or unpunished, unscrupulous behavior abounded, unwanted pregnancies were a common occurrence, secrets were a natural state of affairs, builders were still trying to build their dream, greed and jealousy controlled the townspeople and the clergy, the Church was corrupt, the Prior cruel, the nuns were subservient as were all women, the Noblemen were cruel and the townspeople, largely uneducated, often made foolish spur of the moment decisions for which they paid dearly for the rest of their lives. Injustice existed everywhere, as a natural and accepted course of events. There were the villains and the saints and they remained the same throughout this book with justice finally being achieved hundreds of pages later.<br />Perhaps reading four Ken Follett novels in a row was my mistake. The characters fell prey to the same error of ways as their ancestors and events were so totally predictable, it felt like a soap opera; time passes, but nothing really happens; one could stop watching, pick up years later, and still know the plot and the outcome. Then, of course, there is the fairy tale ending with everyone winding up accomplishing their dream of decades before.<br />The audio version had 36 parts making it a quite a task to complete. However, since the story continues with Caris and Merthin still in love, as in the first book, the reader is interested to find out what will happen to them. She doesn't want to marry; it will take away her independence. He wants to settle down and have a family. What will they ultimately do? That is the question that continues to lure the reader onward.<br />Throughout the years they survive through the plague and its tragedies. They suffer through many unworthy accusations; he is accused of impregnating Griselda, the stepdaughter of Caris' sister Alice; she is  accused of being a witch. The reader will want to continue to read to find out what happens to scheming characters like Philemen, what Ralph and Godwin, and then to find out if Gwenda and Wulfric, and all the other unjustly treated characters, ever prevail. Will Merthin ever achieve his goals? What will ultimately happen to Caris? These are interesting questions but it takes an awfully long time, maybe a little too long, to reach the practically, fairy-tale like ending.<br />A friend mentioned that he really liked the series because of the theme about women's rights that ran through the books. Another reviewer pointed out that there was no such thing as women's rights, at that time, so he did not believe it had a legitimate place in the book. The readers will have to decide on that subject for themselves.<br />However, the history the author presents is well researched and very interesting. If the reader likes Follett's style of writing, the book will not disappoint them, though the more than 1000 pages will be a chore to complete.hem.

B009TSA6YE|3.0|I Grew up with UFO and the Scorpions so I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this set.The  music is great and it's good seeing the members of the Scorpions jam with Michael onstage again. BUT; the vocals are nothing short of horrendous. I have seen some bad vocalist's before, but this guy takes the cake. Makes Neil Young a Opera singer. Was Barden,Moog,Bonnet,Mcalley not available? It's hard to watch at times although the musicianship is great. Hope the word gets back to Michael, I really do. Him AND his legions of fans deserve better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Totally loved this book.  I couldn't put it down, but I was like that with all the books Nicholas Sparks has that have been made into movies.  Definitely one to read!

B007HO392S|4.0|She does it again. I wish she was more natural on these covers, but oh well.<br />Love her voice which helps all the songs. I wonder if she has ever considered doing a spiritual album or even an inspirational album? No doubt our country (world) could use some inspiration now. How about God Bless America.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|At first, this game was rather fun.  I got it for my 5 year old and didn't mind buying the upgrades -- nothing is free in this world after all.  I do think there should be a way to get heart points without having to pay for them.<br /><br />So I buy the upgrades for the frog character, but the next day we LOST all the progress.  The game started us over with no record of the previous profile.  My kid was heartbroken; the frog is a favorite around here.  Despite pleas to buy it again, I refused -- this is like returning to a restaurant that gave you food poisoning.<br /><br />Don't install this game.  It is not \\"free\\" and you will experience both dollars down the drain and disappointment -- even tears, if it's a young child's disappointment.  I was going to buy more Sanrio games, but not anymore...  We'll stick to Angry Birds.
B006ZCWTV0|4.0|After magic and &#34;dream&#34;, thought Bruce was all washed up..so mediocre, so common. But alas, redemption! This is good. I won't compare to earlier works, you can't.  But I tell people as I'm telling you, you will probably be happy with this CD if a Springsteen fan.
B005ISQ7JM|4.0|It's a little hard to review this book, having not read it.<br />I hope it is a good read. Sorry for the poor rating.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Loved it. Just  because.<br />It was raw , real and totally believable. Meaning it could happen to anyone under the  wrong circumstances.
B00000583F|3.0|but i suppose it would be better if youre really into stoner rock...i bought The Sword band cd's and they just jam...
B00AFEXRME|5.0|This movie is a 2 thumbs up I enjoy watching it over and over one of my favorites hope you enjoy it as well
B0091REZMW|4.0|normally I'm not a fan of these types of games,  but this one has really gotten my interest!! just watch your diamond spending!!  You don't have to pay play unless you have poor management of patience! I made to level 140 all free...once you collect friends, everyone seems to help everyone! Has a few bugs, but they are slowly getting better
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin Bacon does a great job, as does the supporting cast. The writing is tight, and the filming and soundtrack supports the story and the elements of suspense.<br />The quality is consistent from week to week-can they keep it up for more than one season? Hard to do! I will keep watching, hoping for an ending that won't leave me with nightmares!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives the reader wants. FACTS!  I enjoyed reading every word! This is a must read cor anyone American.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I purchased this on the Kindle and It will not open.  If it won't open then It should not be on my account
0307891372|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my guy (who has been playing Skyrim off and on for a few months). He's gone into full play mode, super excited about all the &#34;cool stuff they were hiding.&#34; I don't expect him to be sociable again for a while, so I guess it's a good product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a great game to pass the time and it works really well. I would recommend it greatly. I also downloaded it into my phone
B0091REZMW|3.0|Of course, you must pay for additionally to play the game in its whole, but the free time is OK for killing time.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|Product is not intuitive to use. Haven't spent much time trying to learn the product. Might be better once I get to use it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was a great read along with the other two I have read them all 4 times now and just love how it pulls you in and makes you feel alive while reading it!
B00632HWOG|5.0|it helps me to stay in touch.  I like being able to check my mail on my kindle.  the screen is bigger than my phone so I can see it more clearly
B00A77II0U|4.0|The puzzles were lots of fun. The hints helped a lot.<br />I would have enjoyed it more if it had a little darker story and graphics.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love to stay up to date on the weather.  this helps considerably.  I can check the weather whenever and wherever I am.
B007SGM084|4.0|If you take it with a grain of salt and read for the entertainment, I thought it was great fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love sub way surfers because i think it is very inspiring i would recommend this to ennyone all of my family and friends love it as well I LOVE SUB WAY SURFERS
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Downloaded this ebook to re-read the classics.  Great way to read books that I haven't picked up in decades without haveing to purchaes hard copies and fill up my shelves.  Really enjoyed reading the story again.
6305433909|3.0|One really needs to have seen Sister Act I in order to put this one in perspective.  It's kind-of a combination between &#34;Lean On Me&#34; and &#34;The Principal&#34;.
B007N31ZKQ|5.0|I watch this all the time as therapy. Whenever I've had a tough day, I crack open a beer, suspend the thought process and slip this in the machine. It never fails to change my disposition for the better.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book. I loved it and couldn't stop putting it down. It was an amazing book and Cassandra Clare did good.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Early chapters were draggy. Overall plot line was very believable and enjoyable with great ending. This book is highly recommended.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Almost unbelievable crash scene, but it's not really about that. It's about alcoholism, lying, love and honor. Don't watch it on an airplane, but WATCH THIS.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|Great for on the go gaming. Easy to carry on out off town trips and convienant enough to put on your tv console away home.  The kids should be the one that love it but I'm the one that uses it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Only sad that it's over again for the year.  This is the best program on TV in a long time. Of course I don't have HBO or Showtime, so can't compare to those mini-series.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you follow Jack Reacher stories, get this book.  Lots of action, twists and turns as is the Lee Child style.
B009UMTMKS|4.0|The content is fantastic, it makes the process of advising startups so much simpler.  I intend to adopt it for a class I teach, and the kindle version is incredibly cheap.  Thanks Bob & Steve for providing a textbook for 1/15th of the cost of normal textbooks!<br /><br />My problem is that the kindle version does not have page numbers, despite what is stated on the amazon page.  This means it cannot be easily used in a classroom where some will have the book and others will have the kindle version. I will require all students to buy the paper version because of this.<br /><br />The kindle issues are worse than that, however.  For some reason, they decided to create three versions of their textbook, a Strategy overview, another for Web-based startups, and a third Physical startups.  This means there is no version that perfectly parallels the paper version.  This is a big pain if you want to read about both physical and online.  So if you have read the web-based startup section and you then want to learn how to apply it to physical, you have to reread the whole book to find the key differences they apply to physical startups.<br /><br />It is even worse than that, since in numerous places in the web-based section they are forced to reference material that was written for physical startups.  Othertimes, they inexplicably include a long section on physical startups in the web-based startup version of the book.  For example, there is a long passage for physical startups regarding Get/Keep/Grow that is in the web-based section of the kindle version.<br /><br />It is ironic that the authors preach so heavily about not wasting time designing a product or features that customers may not want, yet that is what they have done with the kindle version.  I don't need special versions to assist me in navigating a book, I don't need their constant advice not to \\"implement all this or even process it in one sitting.\\" Yes, I know it is a long book, but any competent reader knows whento skim or skip what doesn't apply to their situation.<br /><br />Solution:  New version that perfectly represents paper copy with page numbers, or, add this as a fourth version that is included with the other three.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I basically just wanted Thrift Shop but when I saw I could get the whole album for a couple of dollars more I figured I may as well. It flows well and a lot of the songs have a really good message.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|As  a red, white and blue-blooded American, I love that line from Lord Grantham to Lady Grantham in episode eight.<br /><br />Beyond that I can only add that season two certainly does not disappoint and is every bit as good as season one.  Not to be missed.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I have been a big Muse fan for years now and while this is a lot different in some ways that a lot of their other stuff, it is creative and a really enjoyable listen!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|One of my daughter's favorites!  Different than the first one and alot more challenging.<br />She really likes this game and the graphics.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Thought it was interesting, the planning and the outcome. Not what I fully expected, although vintage John Grisham. Looking forward to his next book.
B009O07NDY|4.0|If I close my eyes and try to imagine setting out on a new adventure, full of danger and the unknown, Howard Shore's music for 'The Hobbit' would be close to the music I would choose to accompany me. And yet I find myself wanting a little more - or more precisely, a little less.<br /><br />It's amazing music, filled with fellowship and beauty and wonder and danger. Many of the familiar themes of the previous Lord of the Rings films are here, from the notes that hearken back to the Shire in &#34;Old Friends&#34; to a certain slinky theme for &#34;Riddles in the Dark.&#34; There's a good amount of new material too, like the jaunty, unexpected &#34;Radagast the Brown&#34; and the rousing &#34;A Good Omen.&#34;<br /><br />I really enjoyed some of the extra tracks on this Special Edition CD, like &#34;A Very Respectable Hobbit&#34; and the majestic &#34;Erebor&#34; - some of the best individual songs here, to be honest. &#34;Blunt the Knives&#34; is a delightful, spot-on rendition of one of my favourite scenes in the book, and &#34;Misty Mountains&#34; is both hauntingly beautiful and irresistibly catchy. &#34;Dreaming of Bag End&#34; is a pretty, pastoral piece that gets to the heart of what makes 'The Hobbit' a story that has caught imaginations of both young and old.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, it's almost enough to be the music for that journey I have dreamt of and read of many times. Almost.<br /><br />There's a feeling that pervades, though, that the music doesn't feel like the 'Hobbit' I know and treasure. In places (&#34;An Ancient Enemy&#34; for example) slightly overdone, too bombastic...in others, too familiar, borrowing a little too much from the previous films and not staking new musical ground (&#34;My Dear Frodo&#34; jumps to mind, an almost unnecessary mashup of things we've heard before), as though afraid to deviate too much from the awesome scores of the original films. And please...let's not even discuss &#34;The Song of the Lonely Mountain,&#34; the song intended to wrap the movie as the credits roll - the less said about that, the better.<br /><br />And just a word on the packaging for the Special Edition CD. I loved all the extra pictures and the insightful notes from Doug  Adams, but the cardboard case feels a little cheap when I compare it to the leathery, textured covers of the the special edition scores of the Lord of the Rings CDs. It's a little thing, but I couldn't help but be slightly disappointed in the packaging change.<br /><br />It's still amazing music...but I can't help but feel it misses a beat occasionally. When I close my eyes and let my mind wander to that faraway adventure, I can't help but wonder where my Hobbit went, and wish there was a little more of him here.song intended to wrap the movie as the credits roll - the less said about that, the better.<br /><br />And just a word on the packaging for the Special Edition CD.

B0040I09RM|5.0|I love being able to watch without the ads and seeing the seasons I missed out on!!<br />It is great to know I can re-watch at my convenience!!
B006ATJXQW|4.0|Enjoyed all three books in this trilogy. If you like the hunger games you will like this series. Wouldn't be surprised if there was a movie in the works for this one.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Bought these for my kids to use on the computer.  They are light, comfortable, and work well.  And for the price, you can't beat them.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|pretty fun needs some work.<br />good game to play when waiting on other apps to be ready.<br /><br />needs to be more simple.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I buy lots of things on Amazon, and you can check my reviews, I haven't done many.  This book and author deserve one though.<br /><br />First, my history as it is relevant to the review:<br />I have been a football player, powerlifter, sports enthusiast, and lately a mixed martial artist.  My training history goes back more than 20 years (about the only thing longer is my battle against being overweight or obese by the BMI:( ).  I am always reading about how to improve my health, strength, body composition, etc, and it is usually pretty easy to tell how the various books and programs will not work: unrealistic diet, workout plan, etc.  This book is different.  The approach is very straightforward, easy to understand, and contains built-in advice to prevent the user from falling into the various traps & gimmicks pushed by many of the magazines and companies looking to get rich off of those of us trying to get healthy.<br /><br />It is a quick read, and the results have been amazing for me.  I started out at 286 lbs, and after 3 weeks, I am at 269.  I train a lot (12 hours / week between cardio, lifting & martial arts), but I did that at 280 lbs+ too.  The diet really works.<br /><br />Last thing, I had some questions on whether or not the program would work because of how much I was already training, and how hard it could be to make it through a heavy lifting workout after 3 hours in the gym, and after a couple of emails were able to workout some alternatives that have made all the difference.  The author is a stand up guy, and I can't recommend this book enough.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was educational on DV. Yet it was happy and sad I liked the Jo twist and the letter. I wish she could have saved the picture.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy is arguably the best of all the Marvel comicbook hero movies. Good storylines, great action scenes, and of course stellar acting have been features of the series, and the Dark Knight Rises is a wonderful end to the series.
B006UUK612|5.0|My kids were not to excited about watching this, but I knew they would love it once they gave it a chance, and they did. The movie starts off fairly slow but half way through they were locked it and loving it.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It looks awesome on my Kindle Fire. I have really enjoyed reading the dictionary on my Kindle. This is a great quality.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT FIVE STARS IF THE APP WOULD HAVE GIVEN FUTURE RADAR PATTERNS INSTEAD OF JUST PAST TO PRESENT READINGS
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It looks awesome on my Kindle Fire. I have really enjoyed using Google on my Kindle. This is a great quality.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Best movie I have seen in a long time.  It was intense and kept my heart pounding from the beginning to the end.
B00BGDF1FO|4.0|This album contains the vocal tracks in MGR, mostly found during boss encounters. The songs fall into the power metal genre and are themed to the boss characters themselves, which I liked a lot; it reminded me of the Cuts Unleashed CD for Sonic Adventure 2. However, the songs are remixed to a shorter length than their original versions in the OST. Nevertheless you still get your money's worth, with both normal and instrumental versions of each song. Worth looking if you're a fan of MGR and/or power metal.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Needed this to transfer things from the kindle fire to my computer.....works great.....so now am able to transfer from the computer to kindle also if necessary!  Great thing to have!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that you love on the first listen. My only complaint: I wish &#34;Flowers in Your Hair&#34; were about 2 minutes longer!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It kept my attention to the very end on the edge of my seat. Although it ended to quickly since it read so fast.
B007R4ZNWW|4.0|Hard to talk about this movie without spoiling the joy for someone who hasn't yet seen the movie.  Read the basic plot line, but just know that there is much, much, more to this movie.  You may be astonished--I was.  And horrified.  And disgusted.  And amazed.  Once the DVD is more reasonably priced, I may buy it.  I would really like to see this film again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was a fast read, but the story had a lot of unrealistic aspects to it.  There is no way the main character would have zero knowledge of how to text, email, etc. with as much time as she spent witth her neighbor friend. I will admit I was surprised by some of the twists in the storyline.  Mediocre at best.
B009AP2G26|3.0|I've been a fan of glee since the beginning. Not that I hate season 4, just feels like the old glee can't let go. Move on.. you have graduated already. I still watch faithfully.. dedicated fan
0767847431|5.0|They may be corny but I don't care. I love these old classic flicks! It's not worth the time to try to tear down or compare... just enjoy them for what they are! Good ol' fashioned entertainment. Period!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The news feed is real bad, sometimes does not load photos, and I get a &quot;facebook not responding, close or wait&quot; error a lot. Very buggy.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|I have tried other Angry Birds free games on my Kindle Fire and on my Iphone and none had this many advertisements. Some have rolling ads at the top and that's not too bad. This &#34;Free&#34; game on my Kindle Fire has full screen ads that pop up and you have to &#34;X&#34; out of them to continue playing. I went through about 10 levels and it seemed like the ads came up every other screen. I'm sure it's not quite that bad, but it's annoying. If you fail to clear a screen, every time you try again the ad pops up. I got so tired of it I just paid the $2.99 for the regular game.
1451627297|4.0|It's fair to say we're finally seeing the mature Stephen King. That's a good thing, and sometimes not so good.<br /><br />I've often found King's narrative voice overly chatty and, frankly, a little annoying. That's mostly gone. The first person narrator here is stylistically spare and concise. The idea, while not new, comes to glistening life through the author's loving, delicate reconstructions of the past. In 2011 Jake Epping steps into 1958 through an accidental time portal behind a pile of boxes in the dim storeroom of a greasy spoon. Wonder and detail are exquisitely rendered as we watch him fumble to the back of a dark closet and suddenly slide his foot into the light of a sunny day 50 years gone. The hook - Epping's decision to stay in the past for five years so he can try to interrupt one of history's traumatic events - is compelling. The slow (sometimes very slow) buildup to the climactic day both convinces (and unfortunately often drags) with the accumulating weight of day-to-day minutiae. The last 50 pages lurch into a sci-fi alternative present which, unlike the hack copout ending of, say, Under the Dome, I found both nightmarish and believable.<br /><br />In maturity, some of King's bad habits have hardened into concrete. The man apparently hasn't listened to an editor in years. He can't resist transcribing every trivial conversational digression. His dialogue sometimes feels like you're trapped in a room with a bore who blithely yammers on while your eyes slowly roll up in your head. King has also developed this thing where he likes to inject characters from his other books into the current one, which I personally find distracting. Here, he recycles two players from It, in a strained and lengthy scene he keeps on assuring you is sweet and true while you're looking for a cream pie to mash into somebody's face. Then, he's always had the odd habit of giving every inconsequential character a full name. King must've invented 10,000 first-last names over the years, to where he's gotten bored enough to begin slyly swiping names from other authors. When I recognized a Nelson DeMille character it jolted me right off the page. There's no reason for it.<br /><br />That said, it's a good read. Yes, you could put the thing on the stove and melt off 300 pages of pure fat, but that's King and by now he's not going to change. In this book he's gone beyond the gross-out and into the psychological realms he explored in works like The Shining and, later, Misery. Despite the very last scene - which bothers because it's been lifted from the film Somewhere in Time, among others - the payoffs are at the beginning and end. I read it twice and enjoyed it both times. Just skim the middle 300 the second time around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game but I wish I could have more gems so I don't run out I mean you can buy more gems but I want it without having to buy it. But it's a great game if you love animals.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Madness is a recurring theme in American literature, but I've never read a book like Silver Linings Playbook. It reveals the madness in everyday life, for everybody. Every character in this story is damaged somehow, and they each have to find their own methods of repairing that damage. Pat's insight is valuable to anyone who has ever spent time in a bad place of their own.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wonderful reading. Kept me in suspense. A little too gauche at times -- too explicit describing sex activities. But enjoyable.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i love the game I'm addicted to hidden object games they're challenging &amp; fun, give me something to do when I'm bored, or bed ridden bcuz I have epilepsy and sometimes I get put on bed rest after drop attacks bcuz they get really bad &amp; take a lot out of me, and the pain from them &amp; the falls from them affect my back injuries (regenerative disc disease, bulging, slipped, &amp; herniated discs, sciatica, etc...) from complications after being hit by a drunk driver &amp; having the damage misdiagnosed and under treated after accident causing compounded injuries &amp; permanent damage. So I am often on restricted activity and bed rest so these games help then or if I can't sleep and its a quiet game I can play on my kindle when my little guy is napping so it stays quiet &amp; I don't disturb or wake him. Anyway sorry for long winded story don't want people thinking I'm just some lazy bum that just sits around playing games &amp; doing nothing just to be lazy I am often in pain or very sick and am currently disabled so this game helps. Anyway gave it 4 out of 5 bcuz of the timer you can only play a little while then have to wait at least 10 hours b4 your energy is restored and you can play again if not for that and you could just play through until you don't want to play or have stuff to do like with the mystery case files series from big fish games I would have given it a perfect 5 stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally could not put it down. I read the entire novel in 2 days! It was that good! This is a romance novel that will always be on my book shelf (figuratively speaking of course).
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Of all the books with Oliver Stone, this one was my favorite. I couldn't put the book down. I liked how characters from past novels all came together in this one and I liked learning more about Oliver and seeing his other side.  I definitely give this one a 5 stars.
B001NYTUXU|5.0|I have always liked the movie Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron, and one of the things that really drew you in was the music.  Bryan Adams was a good choice for creating the music to go with the movie and although catchy and lovely, they also have life meaning as well and know how to ring true to the heart.  I would most definitely recommend this CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is my second time reading the trilogy. It's even better than the last time. I love the way they love each other. Far beyond the sex, the love story is a BEAUTIFUL thing.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love angry birds and this one is especially fun. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes angry birds and wants a new game. Enjoy!!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is almost real like as if I could actually touch the horse!!!!! In the game you can groom the horse, ride it, give it treats, and take it to competitions. You should  Definitely get this game!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Had read this in High School (required reading ) and I had forgotten most of it  . So  I read it again and liked it . It was a long one .. but was good  to read it again .
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I was always a huge fan of the X files and have been waiting for a show of that style.  I think Fringe is a really good replacement!! It really draws you in!! It has a really good cast and they do a great job playing the roles they were given!!  I wish i would have started watching this show sooner!! I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys shows about the paranormal!! I plan to watch every season!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is perfect for all the horse lovers. This is also great for the people who don't have a horse
0345803507|5.0|I have already reccomended this to my friends that do not already have the book. I also ordered the first book and it arrived on time as did #3.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Finally, a real-to-life account that doesn't read like it came out of a spin machine. And a great reminder of the sacrifice and bravery that so many of our operators, and men/women of our armed services give. Truly, they are the best of us. Thank you, and thank you for issuing the challenge to live for something bigger than ourselves.
0345803485|5.0|I have already told my friends about this and have reccomended it to those that do not have a copy. I receved the book on time along with the 3rd. copy.
0345525558|4.0|An excellent story with many unexpected twists and turns. If there is a language of flowers it was new to me, but very interesting.
0345803493|5.0|I ordered all three books previously and only received book 1 and book 3 from previous vendor......I had to reorder book 2 as it did not come with the original order (not good). This time I tried a different vendor and received my purchases as ordered. Book came in good condition, was listed as used, no markings, no bent pages, no scuffs on cover although it showed as read before. I will order from this vendor again.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I am really enjoying this series.  I am now through some of the third book, the story is very interesting.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was made for the geeks and gamers out there. It was a crazy ride full laugh out loud moments. Mr. Cline you have one he'll of an imagination!

B009KS4XRO|5.0|love this game, everyone should play. it very relaxing you just cant put it down very addictive enjoy the game. BINGO!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a page turner because there were so many twists and turns, maybe just a few too many!
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Val Kilmer was the bomb.  Kurt Russell improves with age.  Supporting cast was competent.  Costumes were excellent.  Photography was beautiful.. Gunfight between Kilmer and Biehn was the best part of the movie.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have never been into romantic or sexual books but these books have an extrodenary story line. I love being able to read them on my kindle.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is totally addictive! Everyone in my family, from my husband to my daughter, loves it and can't get enough.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|A sensitive portrayal  of the  enemy during WW II and the stresses of being a Messerschmitt pilot in a losing war and how one pilot put his humanity first
B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you have a godfather fan you def need to have this in your library. Its a great experience watching it in HD. A must buy
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The episodes are a little choppy but begin to string together nicely towards the end of the season. A new Doctor is introduced in the last episode. I've much enjoyed Ecclestons handling of this character as the change was inevitable.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Got hooked on this series at a relatives house last fall. After watching season one, just had to have the rest of the series.
B002ZG9968|4.0|A guilty pleasure rom-com.<br />Typical boy meets girl, the ups and downs in between before the happy ending with a twist and interesting cliffhanger.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love this PBS series.  Got hooked at a relatives house last fall.  Just had to have the rest of the series.
1932100385|5.0|After reading this comprehensive study I changed my diet and have switched to a vegetarian diet leaning towards vegan and have lost almost 25 lbs while eating as much as I like. I have been on this diet for over 6 months now, still miss having BBQ ribs and a hamburger but have been able to find substitutes and even discovered new things I never would have tried before.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Several of my coworkers had been talking about this show on HBO.  Since I like the knights, queens, kings, etc... themes, I went ahead and bought Season 1.  WOW!! Beyond my expectations.  Was really impressed with one of the Blu-ray features; that being this setting when you play the episodes.  Four on screen icons appear on the right.  They fill in information for the viewer.  What characters are in the scene, description of the scene, think there was history, and another which I can't recall right now.  But I have found them most exciting and valuable to explore.  Excellent epic drama.
075669812X|5.0|This is a fantastic book for any Lego Ninjago fan!<br />The book has sturdy construction with thick cardboard covers coated in a virtually waterproof finish! This book will last forever!<br />Unlike most books aimed at kids, my son has been able to put this in his backpack and take it to school, loan it to friends, leave it rolling around in the car for a week and it still looks amazing!<br />Very well made product.<br /><br />The extra mini figure it comes with was a HUGE hit too! My son practically head a heart attack when he saw it! Apparently that character is the ultimate Ninjago character and is sought after by everyone, so if you haven't been able to find the individual packs this is a great alternative to buying one of the larger more expensive sets if your child wants 'the green ninja!'.<br /><br />The book itself is really nice actually, full color on every single page, and each page is devoted to either a character or a set and it lays out each and every character down to the evil skeleton guys! It includes facts and action shots and has large almost full page images of the characters in each of their forms, such a DX, ZX, etc...<br />My son is an AVID Ninjago fan and even he learned a few things about the characters and their individual stories he didn't already know!<br />It's really an essential book for any fan of the series, and even if there is a passing interest I would think this would be a great choice. It really is a wonderful compilation and has become a revered tome in my house!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game, excellent graphics, the puzzle were not too easy or hard but challenging.  Graphics were sharp, and very colorful. Game very entertaining.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|lots of twists and turns and surprises.  always a good read with david baldacci.  can't wait for the next one.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Great purchase! My son love it and me too, very cute. Many cards to play and fun! Thank you Mattel!!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Great it is a wonderful game I really enjoy playing this. I hope you come out with more like wedding dash and cooking dash
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! It Kept me wanting more! There's also an unexpected twist, I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|These types of games are very relaxing to play.  The interactive parts I love.  The added mini games are good also.  I have several of your hidden object games, keep them coming!!!!!  The price could be a little lower but you can always replay the game at a different setting.  Keep them coming!!!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids love this app and all the other apps by Roxio! I wish they had more educational apps, but these ones are fun and challenging!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle gives a chilling account of what it takes to become a sniper for the Navy SEALS<br />and the training to become an American hero<br />the account given by him is not bragging but the truth that every American should be proud that he gave his live for the best that He could offer his love for country his fellow soldiers and their well being During War time and Peace<br /> It is very troubling that his life  was taken from him while he was trying to help a fellow comrade in arms deal with PTSD
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is SO addicting and fun to play! I love, love, love it!  I would recommend it to ANYONE who likes to play puzzle type games.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My wife and I love Game Of Thrones and it is one of the best shows on TV.  We could hardly wait for this second season to come out on DVD because we enjoy the show so much that once we start watching the series we cannot stop until we are done.  The season was very good and there was a lot of action, particularly in the last two episodes.<br /><br />This season spends a lot of time building on the plot and the inter relationships between the characters.  I won't go into the story line and give any spoilers, but let's just say that it was fun to watch.  My wife loved it and she gave it a solid 5 stars.  I thought it needed some more action in the early part of the season and that the last two episodes were spectacular. The acting was exceptional and the story just keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next thing to happen.<br /><br />While I love all of the characters, even the evil and the good, I particularly like Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) as this role is just special.  He possibly plays the smartest character and the best leader out of the bunch who are vying to be king and yet no one considers him to possibly be the king because of his size.<br /><br />This season is fast moving with old characters making great strides in achieving their goals in the war and new characters coming into the story.  It is a great show with good cinematography, acting and storyline and it is enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />This is another wonderful HBO hit series!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Average action and special effects... Was different from original... Maybe that's why my expectations were already pre-set... I liked the original better overall...
B00B3MN65K|4.0|Seems like he's trying out a new singing style on this album.  It's OK.  There are other albums of his that I like better.
B00336H0QU|4.0|The Cohen's didn't specifically have Job in mind (from interviews with them), but the movie deals with a similar eternal question: why does s*** happen? set in late 60's suburban Jewish neighborhood.  The period details are great, as is the acting.  Not an easy movie, but a good one.
B000JMLFLW|3.0|easy to read catches ur interest quickly good first experience for kindle will reread and look for sequels thank you
B004G600A4|5.0|I see something new every time I see this movie, it is a favorite with the grandchildren and those who watch it with them!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a good game to play with family and friends.  I have used the same game on my IPhone with my daughter and granddaughter.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I am a big fan of Halfbrick. I fell in love with them after the release of Fruit Ninja. Jetpack Joyride is as addicting as it is fun. The side scroller is one of the most amazing games I have ever played since Mario Party 2 for the Nintendo 64. This game rocks. I love you, Barry Steakfries!
1401900526|5.0|These inspirational cards are a repeat purchase for me. The box is filled with great reminders on staying positive in life. Makes for a great gift for my coaching clients, plus I own a box for myself.
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling has proven, without a doubt, her ability to move you into a different place.  Leaving the young reader and fantasy genre behind, she has shown us a place that could be anywhere and people that are everywhere.  Honest, raw and real, she lays it all out in beautifully designed story that sucks you in and holds you until the last word.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|The book gives the impression of having been written by a group effort none of the group knowing each other
B003ODIZL6|4.0|It is a huge and amazing dictionary that would satisfy the likings of even Socrates. I recommend to all of the people
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a great. Book . I would not suggest to childern under 6 years. It tells great detail about xh charachter if you love reading and the wizard of oz the movie you will love the book!!!!!
B009MF5BXK|1.0|OK so Jet Li was the best part of the first one, Dolph Lundgren and Jean Claude Van Damme seemed very interesting in this one.  So let's focus on Arnold.  This movie is jut a misfire from the word go.  Chuck Norris was fun but again he was nothing more than a glorified cameo. This was all about Sly and Arnold and the more interesting characters were just not utilized. Even the villains weren't as much fun as in the first one.  Don't waste your time!
B0079XNWQA|4.0|I love most all of the songs on this CD but a couple don't really do a lot for me.  The best song of all is &#34;Don't give up&#34; - in fact, this song is the reason I purchased this CD in the first place.  Jason Mraz has a really nice voice - pleasant and enjoyable to listen to.
B0029O08WA|5.0|If your daughter is a twilight fanatic like mine, hit the buy button.<br />PERFECT gift for the 14 year old girl
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Please give Charles Edwards, and Laura Carmichael a fairytale ending....let the wife die peacefully, to free Michael Gregson (Charles Edwards) to ask for Edith Crawley's (Laura Carmichael) hand in marriage. I would like to see a fairytale wedding, not to best Lady Mary, and Matthew, but one in which Edith will finely find happiness!!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Perhaps because Harry is investigating a Cold Case from years ago when LA was burning during the Rodney King riots, perhaps because Connelly needed to navigate (very artfully) between that time and the present, perhaps he himself noticed that his considerable literary skills had not been sufficiently challenged by his other series characters, perhaps because he is still one of the most skillful and entertaining crime and mystery writers around, this book is an absolute delight. Just don't expect the title to have much relevance to the actual goings-on, it's a stand-in for a philosophic or heuristic approach to puzzle-solving and not a buried container for a body or a real box containing stolen loot. Other than that minor caveat this novel is a purr-fect outing and the less said about the clever plot the better.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Perfect! The acting, singing and production could not have been more perfect.  It is a must watch at least every two years.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|one and probably the only original and  creepy shows out there. it was very original, kept me at the edge watch it often, did like the maid... Genius idea..
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a fun and enlightening book to read!  Cheryl takes the reader with her on two journeys - one physical and the other spiritual. After her mother, the center of her being, passes away from a quick illness, what's left of Cheryl's family (brother, sister, stepfather) dissolves in pain. Cheryl strays from being centered-responsible-good to drug infused-cheating-bad. In order to save herself, she decides to hike the Pacific Crest Trail alone.<br /><br />Through her accurate and thorough story telling the reader is transported. You are on those mountains feeling the heaviness of her backpack, the frustration of being an inexperienced hiker, the pain of toenails falling off, the fear of what is ahead. Her physical experience becomes yours. However, during her spiritual journey she walks the walk alone. The reader watches from afar, but not detached, and roots her on, sometimes with eyebrows raised. At the end of her journeys, she finds herself not only a survivor, but a conquerer. The kindness of strangers, the beauty and power of nature, and the time alone to quiet her mind has brought her to a place of acceptance and contentment. She concludes, \\"it was my life - like all lives, mysterious and irrevocable and sacred.  So very close, so very present, so very belonging to me.  How wild it was, to let it be.\\"
B000BZISTE|5.0|two disc collection with scenes not seen in the theatre version, do like finding deals such as this when looking.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|This app uninstalled on its very own. I spent 50000 for Scarlet!!!!! I had a bunch of coins!!!!! This app is just too plain sneaky when I was happy about it!!! This just stink that I have to play it 20 more times or more!!!! This ruined my happiness. I though apps were supposed to stay where the are. but never mind. No more running apps for ME!!!!!!!!!
B00371XIJE|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and the recipient states it was exactly as advertised and enjoyed the movie very much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm not sure what the problem is with the people who don't like this game. its perfect, maybe something is wrong with there device because this game is awesome. I downloaded both one and two, happy with both. in my life ive written reviews for maybe 10 things, I just thought this was worthy.
B000683VI4|5.0|I purchased one and then had to get another for my daughter, Great movie! Watch constantly and never get tired of it,
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the perfect thing to waste your time. you get sucked in and sit there for hours going &quot;just one more run&quot; but its never just one more run. love this game.
6301971272|5.0|Completely satisified with the product. Has extra scenes not in the version from years ago. Enjoyed the movie very much!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is super challenging for me. Hey, I'm considered an &#34;oldster&#34;! Wish the game had some instructions for us retirees, but it is fun, annoying, and sure makes me pay attention Love the graphics and the little headlines after I run into a tree or miss a turn...funny writers. Smart alecs like me. I haven't gotten very far but it sure makes me want to kick butt when I fall off a bridge, or run into a tree...Ouch! AND mys grandaughter won't play it, says &#34; its too hard Gramma!&#34; Yay, for the old girl.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|Fantastic movie, great actor. This is one that I can continue to watch and not get tired of. Great price!
B005JE1KHE|5.0|Hobb certainly doesn't disappoint with this brilliant second installment. Just as imaginative and clever as The Assassin's Apprentice, I was converted to a near insomniac whilst reading this book! I am in awe of the story itself, the characters, the world in which the plot has been set and the unsuspected twists that are riddled throughout. LOVE LOVE LOVE this! I had to purchase book 3 straight away after finishing this, cannot wait to get stuck into it!
078322947X|5.0|Just another great movie by a good actor and we will continue to look for more that he has performed in
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It<br />This is a great game. WwwIt sure will keep you busy for hours. You have to figure out a lot by trial and error
B003G4W49C|5.0|i had read this book 10 years ago and loved it. when i picked it up this time i couldnt put it down again. i rereading the whole series at the moment.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|Wonderful yarn set in the Hebrides.  The story moves from the present to the past in a well structured, well researched, thread.  The authors research of the events in which he based the story are flawless and I was drawn to do my own research on this remarkable tradition.  The flawed main character is authentic and likeable.  Once you start this book be prepared to set aside all else!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I accidentally found Season 1 on my own and was well into Season 2 when it seemed the whole world was watching Downton Abbey.  Beautifully done--even the scenery is eye candy.  I believe Season 2 lives up to Season 1.
B009B2VBWE|1.0|This album is not so hot.  The producer didn't really bring out the true aspects of the songs, the recording studio didn't mix it well, and the overall effect is disappointing.  On most songs, you cannot make out her singing, unless you raise the volume, which then makes the other instruments TOO loud.  This could have been a much better album if they had done a better job of mixing, and the producer had pulled more out of Diana.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is an instructional guide provided by the Amazon KDP team. It is well written and easy to understand.  A definite five star effort.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This was not the best Bosch book I have read but still keep me interested.  Maybe Harry is at end of his run.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|This series is great ! The kids will love it , same great characters . But I think it has ran it's course, for us adults that is. The story line is dull it's the same story as the other ice age movies, just different circumstances .
0765350386|5.0|This was the first Sanderson book I read besides the last few wheel of time books.<br /><br />As a person who reads a lot of fantasy I am very pleased with this book because although the plot arc and &#34;hero journey&#34; is familiar enough that I don't feel like I'm reading anything &#34;out there&#34; or &#34;experimental,&#34; Sanderson still does a good job of surprising me with the direction the story takes on more than once occasion.  Very good foreshadowing and a little bit of misdirection makes you say at the end &#34;I should have seen that coming, but I didn't!&#34;<br /><br />This is the first in a trilogy and I think it's my favorite.  It's hard to say.  I'm not saying that it's the best fantasy book ever written but it is very enjoyable and will keep you flipping the pages.  I really liked it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book is good but predictable. Probably best for young women readers. Too detailed in some areas and not enought clarification at the end.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was the most shocking and exciting.  Recommend very highly, will not dissapoint at all  Love the series very much
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read - keeps you hooked to the end!I really enjoyed the twist and was quite heart wretching at times
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It is a fascinating story. It bogged down a bit 3/4 of the way through because it got into the science of Neurosurgery, the brain and Coma. It was hard for me to follow with no medical training. I was always stopping to read the definition of a word. I did expand my vocabulary while reading the book.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|First of all I wanted to scream at the suspension of this bookseller well done james darshner but I was disappointed with the ending I was left in the dark on the strangest thing of all, Tom's past. My suggestion, write a conclusion sequel.
1451695195|3.0|I have read others books on the same subject and I must says this was my least favorite .<br />I do not think I will be recommending it to my friends
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Enjoyed the set completely. I am addicted to Downton Abbey. Just saw season three. I  am astonished at final episode, but can't wait for 4th season.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|simply put I love it it's great album listen with the headphone. listen to it back to back that's the only way.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was excited to read this book because I had enjoyed the first two books so much but the ending left me wanting more.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Full of mystery and suspense. You never know what's going to happen and who the enemy is. Very well written.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Being a huge fan of the play I have tried many times over the years to read this book & have never been able to finish it.  It moves at a very slow pace & is at hard times very hard to follow.
0307949486|4.0|After getting into the book a little, it got very interesting. I felt the beginning was a little hard to follow. It does get better as it goes on. The Movie is great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I got this after reading the hunger games & wanted to be able to continue the story.  I enjoyed the book & it made me look forward to completing the series.
B00702MUYA|5.0|I am going to see Leonard Cohen in concert next week and I wanted to be familiar with all his music.  This album sounds better every time I listen.  I think my favorite song on this album is Going home but Amen and Lullaby are also up there.  The music is so deep and beautiful that it almost breaks your heart.  His voice is both gravily and mellow at the same time.  I am very glad I bought it and do recommend it if you are a Leonard Cohen fan like me.
B004VPAXHU|4.0|The Fishpeople release has the single version of cloudbusting, which is sort of jarring when you paid for the whole album. Avoid the Fishpeople release.
B0000042MY|5.0|ah, what could be more romantic, the woods, Daniel Day-Lewis and those word &#34;where ever you are I'll find you!&#34;.  Kind of cleans up history.  This music is light, refreshing, and at times you loose yourself in it, and it contains none of the history...not bathing, rotten teeth, little laundry, monotonous food, bad or no meat,walking everywhere, few roads, what few roads are filled with animal exhaust, men and women who smell like last year's underwear....this makes you forget it all and takes you to a place like no other!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This movie was such a waste.  A waste of time for everyone involved in the making, and a waste of time for anyone who bothered to rent/buy it.  I was severely disappointed. Bad writing, bad acting, and bad special effects.  Sorry if anyone really liked it!
B000004286|4.0|Fantastic back ground music, when mu-zac is intolerable.  Beautiful for situations of stress, bill paying or you just wanna get cozy with a kilt or the guy wearing one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and will keep u on your toes. This game really lets u practice your hand eye coordination and let's u have fun while doing this. Really, the game is supper fun and I hope everyone else enjoys the game as much as I have.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app.  Always shows what I'm looking for.  Plus more if I want it.  I use it for my alarm clock so it helps me know what to wear each day.
B00AOMR2S2|4.0|there are a few songs i dont care for but overall definitely worth buying the whole album just over individual songs.
B0063IH60K|4.0|There isn't much you can say about solitaire.  It's easy to play, the graphics are good so it's clear and colorful.  Othere than that it's just a fun way to pass the time when you're bored.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|It does the job of charging the Kindle, but make sure you are not in a hurry. It takes a lot longer than the plug in charger...4-5 hours as compared with an hour or less.
0767903862|4.0|I was assigned to read this book for a class that I took on my study abroad trip to Australia.  The author is HILARIOUS in his writing style and I have learned a lot of interesting facts about Australia, the people, the aboriginal history and the unique and special animals in its landscape.  There were some dry spots that I had to grudge through and honestly wished he would get to the freaking point, but all in all it was a great read.  I was in a group of 23 other students and they all seemed to enjoy the book as well.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The series were great this was the best book series I've read in years. I would definitely read this again.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is super duper fun buy the scenery is very distracting and its hard to pay attention but otherwise very fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I never seeneny thing like it y'all. will. love. it. please ply it yallwill.luv it peace. out suckers bye felree
B003O86FMW|4.0|I didn't think I would like this book. I downloaded it for my daughter. I soon found myself in a doctor's waiting room with my kindle and decided to give this book a try since.it was already in my kindle. I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. So much so that I had to get the first book in this series. It's a good book for adults and preteens. Loved it.
B0052RDHTM|2.0|Really, this is better than Pillars of the Earth, but of course that isn't saying much. If you can trudge through the first half of the book, the second half starts to move at a turtles pace toward a fair ending. This book, in a digest version, would still be too long. Are editors afraid to tell Mr Follett he needs to lose better than half of this book? I cannot imagine wasting the time or the brain cells trudging through the next two books of this series.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Hated to see this season end.  We need more series like this.  God bless the British.  So creative.  Keep up the good work.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Besides the horror aspect of the show.<br />The writing, story line, characters and sub plots and stories.<br />The actors themselves make it very believable.<br />Best show on cable TV.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|depressing movie - perhaps an accurate portrait of a life consumed by addition, but it was hard to watch.  So sad....
B000HZED8S|4.0|Filmed as in the genre of the weekly cliff hangers from old cinema.<br />Great graphics, directing is good.<br />Story line is interesting, the actors are good in the characters.<br />Jude Law is excellent in the main lead spot.<br />Gwyneth Paltrow is great as the perky reporter.<br />Angelina Jolie is perfect in her part.<br />If you like the old 1940's cartoons, cliff hangers, you'll like this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this series....the acting, the setting, the characters.  It is very refreshing to realize that TV can be entertaining and at the same time keeping high standards.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|These are the kind that get to me, good plot and characters that have strong personalities. Enjoyed the movie and the actors were fantastic!!
B008S80PCE|5.0|I am a huge Bill Withers fan as I'm sure you are too if you're reading this. Other reviews have praised this box set and deservedly so. However, there are some missing links; odds & ends that completists would have enjoy having been included that weren't. One is the 1981 45 U.S.A. which others have referenced as not being on CD. It is! Here is the Amazon UK link; http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Sound-Soul-Bill-Withers/dp/B0032XFSHW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361644806&sr=8-1<br />Grab it FAST! David
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|out of all the hungry shark games, to me this is the best one out yet! it's hard to put down! The graphics and sounds are great. This game is overall great.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|I liked this movie.  I've seen bits and pieces of the old series so I can see where the inspiration came from but it gets a little silly in places.  The quality is great, but the movie itself can be a little hard to sit through
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This battery app does exactly what it claims. Very useful, helpful app. Tells me how long I can use my Kindle depending on what I am doing, watching tv, listening to music, reading a book etc. Very happy to recommend.
B00003CXDD|5.0|i grew up on this movie and i love it, my children will grow up on this movie as well as other classics such as princess bride , goonies and never ending story
B002LANLDK|5.0|In this world there are lovers and haters of films that are all about unbelievable action, if you are in the latter camp then this film isn't for you.<br /><br />If however you love fast cars, improbably crazy stunts, cool locations and testosterone fun then watch this movie. Like I said it's a guilty pleasure and worth the money for the digital rental.<br /><br />Amazons digital service has come on leaps and bounds and if you want instant gratification then use it!!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|A. Great brain workout.  Same puzzle each time though fun to better your time score<br />I had a game called Mahan.  Same puzzle but had a variety of symbols and shapes. Good for any age. Good for hand/eye coordination.<br /><br />Swancolt
B001706I5I|4.0|Great family film to throw on the TV and just chill out too. Funny, filled with Christmas cheer and a laugh fest!
B000002J2F|5.0|This is a must have album as a Genesis fan.<br />From beginning to end you have great lyrics and music.<br />Enjoy!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We decided to buy this digitally from the Amazon Store and have enjoyed this show immensely.<br /><br />This is the ultimate turn your brain off (its a show about fairytale characters in the real world) that sucks you in. The characters are well written, production values are high and its an entertainment fest.<br /><br />Fun thing game to play - spot which female lead has hair extensions and how they change episode to episode.<br /><br />Love this show :)
1451627297|5.0|Just finished reading Stephen King's \\"11/22/63\\" - An amazing portrayal of life back in the days of the Kennedy assassination and the story of one man's lone attempt to jump back in time and change history.<br /><br />Anyone familiar with King's work should read this book. Not only does this book prove that Stephen King is once again a master story teller, but it does something else, it makes you believe in the power of time-travel, in the power of one man against the 'obdurate past' and also (and perhaps more importantly) to never underestimate the power of love between two people as Jake Epping discovers in 11/22/63. Can not recommend it enough.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|KAT. 23 February 2013. Good game. Enjoyed playing it.Some of the hidden objects quite difficult to find which made game more challenging! There was a bit of going back and forth but this was good as it kept your \\"little grey memory cells\\" challenged to remember where to go back to, so you could solve another piece of the puzzle!! All in all an enjoyable game!

B004J4WKTW|3.0|This is a book club pick for me.  It was very well written, but I found it difficult to become attached to the characters & I got them confused.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Overall, I liked \\"Safe Haven\\" better than Nicholas Sparks' other novels to date. Sometimes Sparks gets too preachy or religious for my liking. He didn't overdo it here. Katie was an interesting character with a dark secret. However, you want nothing more than her to have a better life and overcome her past.<br />I love novels with a strong female lead. No brainer about the romance. You really want Katie to be happy and safe after what she went through so finding a catch in Alex made you want to root for true love the whole way.<br />The twist at the end was interesting and clever. Great buildup to the final conflict as well. I love how Sparks shifts each chapter to a different main character. Keeps it fresh and gives you a chance to know how the characters are feeling. Clever way to dive into past events as well. Quick read.<br /><br />Get ready to swoon!

B0035JRUZQ|4.0|El Dorado (1967) is an unabashed remake of the 1959 film Rio Bravo.  Both films are directed by Howard Hawkes, and I have to wonder what his motivations are for directing two movies that are almost identical replicas of each other?  Hawkes did not change too much in the remake, so perhaps based on the success of Rio Bravo, Hawkes just wanted another successful payday.  In any event, both movies were successful, and it is still debated to this day which is the better movie.  Rio Bravo has Wayne as Sheriff (J.T. Chance) with drunken deputy Dean Martin, crusty old deputy Walter Brennan, and handsome singing sensation Ricky Nelson as Colorado (a hired gunslinger).  El Dorado has Wayne as a hired gun helping a drunken sheriff, (Robert Mitchum), a crusty old deputy in Arthur Hunnicutt, and handsome youngster in James Caan (as Mississippi).  The plots are almost exactly the same.  The sheriff decides to hold up inside the jail house with his prisoner and wait for help from the federal marshal.  There is the same joke about the drunk taking a bath (Martin and Mitchum), and there is the 'let's take a turn around the town\\" sequence where an exciting gunfight breaks out.  Both films have a bar scene where the drunken lawman has to redeem himself.  Both films also conclude with a final climatic gunfight. In Rio Bravo, Angie Dickenson is cast as the sexy female lead, and in El Dorado, Charlene Holt gets the role. Both films had the same screenwriter as well.<br /><br />The movie rating site, Rotten Tomatoes, gives El Dorado 7.9 stars and Rio Bravo 8.2 stars.  Both films are truly enjoyable, and both have their share of excitement and laughs. Rio Bravo has a more laid back feel to it, where El Dorado seems the more driven film.  The bottom line is that both films are rated high by the audience in terms of enjoyment.<br /><br />Any fan of Wayne will want to see both films.  If I had to pick my favorite, it would certainly be a toss-up, both are about equal on my scale.  Both have action and laughs, and make for a fun experience for all.<br /><br />koneaction and laughs, and make for a fun experience for all.<br /><br />kone

0321701763|4.0|For me, Photoshop always seemed a little too complex for its own good.  Many basic functions seem to be buried behind a non-intuitive maze of right-clicks and tabbed control panels.  You just can't fake it with Photoshop. This book definitely lifts the veil and uses clear, simple step=by-step instructions to unlock the essential, everyday tools that every pro uses. This book has helped me to start using Photoshop with confidence rather than scary caution. I recommend it for other beginners.

B00009YXHN|5.0|I gave this to my uncle for his birthday and he loves it so much. He had been looking for this for awhile.
0060751967|3.0|I liked this book but there was I did not really like the heroine that much.  Roman went out of his way to bend over backwards so she had everything she needed.  He tried hard to keep her safe.  He almost desperately tried to get her to love him and yet she never thought about any of that through out the book.  She knew the mafia was after her and yet she ran because she was jealous over another woman.  Yeah I agree she should have been upset about the women but she should have asked him about it instead of hauling ass.  Especially knowing she could get killed or get other people killed it seemed like she acted fairly petty.  Once she found out he was a vampire she had a right to be upset but even when she decided he was the good guy she still spent most of the book making excuses about why he wasn't good enough.  Personally I think he was too good for her and I didn't like her.

B000KIPT30|3.0|I got this amplifier several years ago and have used it continuously until it finally died today. My original use was to drive my very old high-end headphones from my computer. More recently I have used it to boost the audio from my computer up to a level that I can consistently hear with normal computer/mp3 player headphones.<br /><br />Overall the amplifier has worked, but it has a couple of quirks that make it frustrating. First of all, as some others have noted, the power connector is very loose. The slightest bump will cause intermittent connection problems and the connector will fall out by its own weight. It was this way from the start. Also a problem from the start was more hiss and hum than is really acceptable. I don't care too much because I have very severe tinnitus and pristine sound quality is wasted on me anyway. The jacks all very quickly became loose and required some messing with them to get a reliable sound. Over time several of them quit working and today the input jack broke - hence my current shopping spree for a replacement.<br /><br />The biggest flaw was that the volume boost was never a great as I really wanted. It was probably only about a 10-15% boost (based on how much I could turn the volume on the computer down to get the same volume). I really had hoped for more.<br /><br />With all that said, however, it gave me about 4 years of acceptable service for a low price and only occasionally made me want to throw it out the window. I'm hoping I can find better this time around.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|This is a different kind of reading than I am accustomed. My adult daughter recommended it and I'm glad I read it. I originally had problems staying focused with the story-line but once I did I couldn't put the book down.  I'm sure I will ponder the hidden lessons for months to come and will read it again. I recommend this book when you are ready to challenge and explore your deep rooted beliefs about time and life.  &#34;Time flies&#34; will never be a meaningless expression again.
0316228532|1.0|Of course, like most people, I love the Harry Potter books so I was really hoping this would be a good transition for JKR to an adult audience - boy was I disappointed!  The characters are awful, there are too many of them, none of them were ever fully developed.  But worse was the stereo typing - those from the  'posh' part of the village were narrow minded, spiteful, snobby, mean-spirited and downright unlikable.  Even worse was the depiction of the people from the 'poor' side of the town - if you believe JKR then everyone in social housing (or council estates as we call them in England) are badly educated drug addicts with poor hygiene, bad teeth, no self esteem and of course should not be allowed to breed because they can't take care of their children.  I live in a similar village to the one in the book and I was appalled at the portrayal of the characters.  Please don't waste your time on this book.  It has nothing that redeems it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Waterproof, cute, and durable.  This case has it all.  It was a little tricky getting my phone into it the first time, but after that it's been a piece of cake.  Just remember to bring the headphone adapter with you, otherwise you can't connect your phone to them.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Very entertaining much like the Jack Reacher special forces series by Lee Childs. A chair gripper from the beginning to end.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was a really fun book with lots of twists and turns.  Beautiful imagery of things created in the circus and the spectator's responses to them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I saw this book and the ratings, I started reading without reading a summary (because I rarely do). Once I began reading I was surprised a high school romance book hot such high ratings---now I know why. This book is so much more. I love the depth of this book and all of the emotion. I love how everything comes together. Great read! Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Been meaning to read this for quite some time when the opportunity arose...great book!!!  Good quick read, page turner, adventure and young innocent love.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|i only rate this a 4 out of 5 because there was no software cd included....<br /><br />but really good mouse for gaming...your overall feel for the mouse will take some adjustment but when you figure out how you want to hold the mouse its all good from there
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is easily the most quality game I have played for any mobile platform. Beautiful graphics and controls make this game fantastic. The only thing I find bothersome about this game is that sometimes it is difficult to place the balls sometimes because my finger gets in the way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|omg I love this game usually girls don't like this game but I do I'm a tomboy and I lobe to kill lol
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|Fun and entertaining for me and the kids. The game play is simple and challenging all at the same time. Could use a few more levels.
B006HH5Y6K|5.0|I've owned this album off and on for decades. I still play it all the way through, even on the minor tunes. The extended edition I did not appreciate due to the non-sensical inclusion of an interview that should have been placed on a seperate disc. Now I can put this one on during poker or a cookout and not worry about the garrish not-so-dead-air moments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was a very pleasant game with good graphics I think every should play it and learn how to be responsible with the care of an animal
B007I1Q4W2|2.0|I like small movies. Independent films. Quiet horror.<br /><br />When done well.<br /><br />This one almost - almost - fit the bill.<br />There were decent make-up effects, some atmosphere, a novel placement for a zombie outbreak and even some good performances once we got past the over-wrought histrionics of the first chapter of the story. Sometimes less is more which would have been a good film editors suggestion, in this case.<br />  This isn't a really bad movie. With a little more effort, this could have been a special film. But, unless you're a friend of one of the individuals involved in this production, a die-hard zombie fan or feel 'Lizard Lick  Towing' should be in the running for an Emmy and those darn &#34;Squatches are just too sneaky to ever let themselves get properly photographed, splashed like a deer on a bumper or leave tell-tale bone piles lying around, find yourself something else to watch.<br /><br />  Sorry, didn't do it for me.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Really like this game, I would definitly recommend this. I choose this because it's a really good, and really fun.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|The first thing I noticed with this third entry of Daniel Craig into 007's role is that they all have rough, wild, and long chase scenes as their staple, and that while the other Bonds seldom so much as got their clothes dirty, Craig takes a physical beating that no previous Bond has ever endured. And these are getting old rather quickly.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed is that the new Bond films are extremely light on dialogue in the sense that Craig's Bond character has almost nothing to say, which is probably just as well, because he's hard to understand, as is the heavily British mumbling throughout. But, then, mumbling is not just the problem with these Bond films. Clear, understandable movie dialogue seems to be a thing of the past. Mumbling in English is hard enough to follow. Mumbling in British, is damned near impossible. And trying to watch while reading subtitles drastically takes away from seeing the film.<br /><br />As for Skyfall, in particular, there really is no plot development; action has taken over. But then Ian Fleming is no longer writing the stories but they appear to be pieced together by hacks.<br /><br />Despite all this, I gave Skyfall a middling three stars just because it is a Bond movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like this game. The power-ups could use some work but other than that it's a good game. Subway Surfer is an app that everyone should buy.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I think its reputation is well deserved. A cinematic delight, masterful, compelling and a very fine work of art indeed.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this book because it's probably one of the best books for us children. It's funny, it helps you with your reading, it's every thing a kid need in their books. That's why I gave this 5 stars
B000002G23|5.0|Even the songs you never want to hear again, and the ones you never wanted to hear in the first place. But it also has the good ones, all in one collection.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|i loved this movie because i loved there voices and the way the movie was put together and i also really liked the ending because i liked how the took clips of different songs.
0793518326|5.0|I live by this book. It's the most accurate, most detailed, and, frankly, most obsessive, Beatles book. The type is tiny so it's no good on the fly, but if you need to do your homework before a gig, this is the book.

I was saving the hunt of level 50 and the new river hunt for a disabled child who loves the Flamingos Orkas and Dolphins BUT the game won't load any more. So frustrated that I spent so much time and now I can't finish the game. I can't bring myself to start over.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I used this on my Kindle, to wake me up in the night to meet a deadline. It's perfect. There are a number of sound choices for the alarm, and I used &#34;Bells&#34;, which was soft, yet enough to gently wake me. I really appreciated that!! Very clear and easy to read at night, even without my glasses.
B00846REIS|5.0|I don't ever want Eva and Giddeon to end. I love this story. I have read it at least 3 times! So excited for book 3
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It's amazing that many reviewers who have reflected their feelings here seemed surprised, upon seeing the movie, that it is sung all the way through.  Les Mis has been around since 1985 and the fact that not only it, but many musicals written since the 70's, are sung all the way through is not news.  All of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals are, certainly, and Les Mis, with great acclaim, jumped into the midst of all that modern musical theater and has literally held up it's flag proudly all along.<br /><br />Les Mis is a classic story of a man's spiritual journey from being a bitter, resentful man who has not hope, to one who follows God and therefore changes many people lives for the better as their own lives intersect with his, except for Inpector Javert who, even though he does see the goodness of Jean Valjean, can't deal with it and makes his own life-altering choices.<br /><br />Is the movie all that it could be?  Probably not on all levels, but it really gets close.  Hugh Jackman has a long history with stage musicals and does a fine job.  Russell Crowe's singing is a bit lacking, especially comparing him with Philip Quast, the greatest Javert ever, but he does well enough.  Anne Hathaway's up-close interpretation is more emotionally intense than Patti Lu Pone's, but it works.  Amanda Seyfried does hit all the operatic Cossette notes, not with the skill of other Cossettes, but she does it.  Samantha Barks as Eponine hits a home run and why wouldn't she with her background.  Eddie Redmaine may be no Michael Ball, but he is a sympathetic Marius and he and Amanda do make a good couple.<br />This is a great movie, it's great to have it on screen, and most who are familiar with the original stage presentation should be happy.<br /><br />For those out there who still don't like the \\"sung-all-the-way-through\\" aspect of Les Mis, you should probably be seeking out non-musical movies and plays in the first place.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Denzel Washington's movies and I think this is one is Denzel Washington's best performance. An oscar performance.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Those of us who grew up literally alongside the internet and online gaming have a perspective that nobody else going forward will ever really have, and even though I'm sure this book will remain entertaining for kids today and their kids to come, it was written for those of us who played Ultima Online and Everquest when they first launched, or suffered through Johnny Mnemonic and The Lawnmower Man, or read Snow Crash and were captivated by the sometimes-better, sometimes-worse virtual worlds those things presented us.<br /><br />Ready Player One was written for folks like me, and I'm glad that it was.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Funny, sad, and true to life. A very enjoyable story with a happy ending. Meryl Steep and Tommy Lee Jones very good together.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Keys are still making great music.  This is an excellent album.  Of course, we've heard some of the riffs before and the drum sets can have airs of the past, but that's why I love their music.  Maybe a little too much production for the purist; I can respect that point of view, but the music is just damn good.  It has a flavor that is recognizable and wonderful.  I love it front to back, not a bad song in the set.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|how unique, fun visiting players and things to find and collect.  be careful, not all creatures are your friends though.  Loved this game, no fighting.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|I think its a great game... but in the description it says ragdoll effect and it doesn't have that<br />so I give it a 3 out of 5
B0091JQH2Q|5.0|This is a nice way to start out a new year. I knew of the esteem many Sibelius lovers had for this set, even in preference to Berglund's impressive digital re-dos with Helsinki in the 80's. Formidable as that set is, I understand now what the fuss is all about and think this Bournemouth set to be the more compelling experience overall. This is a younger ( early 40's) Berglund and a group of musicians that clearly are excited about making Sibelius happen. The cycle was the contractual windfall with EMI in the wake of their success with making the first recording of the Kullervo Symphony in 1970. That brilliant performance and their subsequent Sibelius renderings for EMI in the 8 years to follow, established Berglund's international  stature as a major conductor.<br />Compared to the later Helsinki set, these are fresher, more emotionally engaged performances with an excitement factor missing in the later Helsinki performances - impressive performances though they are.<br />What surprises is how much more &#34; personal &#34; the interpretive approach is. Berglund was not adverse to making changes to Sibelius when he thought the composer took a misstep. The tempo fluctuations are much greater than Berglund would allow in later years. The solo flute passage in the first movement of the 3rd symphony is a prime example. The 2nd symphony starts at a slow tempo that makes one think &#34; boredom&#34;. Stay with it, it quickly becomes a grippingly absorbing, tightly wrought experience that culminates in an outstanding performance. Standout performances are the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th and (in particular) the 7th symphonies. (I have not yet heard the 4th.)<br />The 7th symphony is the outstanding performance; it is a spaciously luminous, expansive account that yet maintains the long line and grips the listener. It may be the most compelling reading I've heard on records.<br />Bournemouth, tonally and technically, are not as suave a group as 80's vintage Helsinki, but they, nevertheless, play at the top of their considerable game under Berglund.<br />The sound quality (2013 remastering) is superbly spacious, yet detailed, without undo spot-mike highlighting. In other words, vintage late analogue EMI stereo courtesy of engineer Stuart Eltham. ( EMI of late no longer likes to give credit to the remastering engineers...thumbs down because this is a first rate remaster.) The Guildhall, Southampton was the venue save for symphony No. 2 (Abbey Road Studio 1) and No. 6 ( Kingsway Hall). The sense of spacious depth in the Guildhall recordings makes me wonder if the remaster engineer mixed into the stereo tracks some back channel ambience as I know at least some of these were recorded in 4 channels for SQ quad. Recent Abbey Road/EMI remasters of their 1970's quad material have had this done so they don't sound so &#34;dehydrated&#34; in a stereo only guise. ( Early CD reissues of such demonstrates this problem well.)<br />Given the price, this is a gift for Sibelians everywhere. If Berglund's later performances were always impressively thought, these are the renderings that are more outright - and deeply- felt. They give us a valuable view of a great conductor just hitting his stride back in those palmy days of the 70's...40 years ago. The older I get, the more I hate math.eless, play at the top of their considerable game under Berglund.<br />The sound quality (2013 remastering) is superbly spacious, yet detailed, without undo spot-mike highlighting.

B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book was so juvenile, the characters were immature I also didn't like the way it was written.  The main character is a troubled 15 year old that cries all the time, I found him very unlikable.  I didn't relate at all to this book, for sure written for a very young reader.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|A very entertaining game, but as other reviewers have said, it's too hard to get the necessary peanuts, especially later in the game. I got to the point where I could not complete the quests as I was not prepared to spend real money for peanuts!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I used to play this game on my step sisters I pod and when I heard you could get it on a kindle fire I thought the graphics would be bad because the kindle fire is so much bigger but there the same. Also most of the time when there's in app purchasing on an app you can only make it to about level 4 or 5 in this game however you can continue to level up to the highest level without spending any money. I wish I could give this app infinity stars.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is much better than the originalangry birds. Good action and a blast to play. Highly recomend for angry birds fans
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I read it because of all the hype that surrounded it. It was an interesting & addictive read. Looking forward to the next instalment.
B000FC10MU|5.0|As a young reader, I loved science fiction.  This book is similar to the worlds I knew so well then, but much more advanced in terms of its handling of philosophy and psychology.  This is an adult read.  The characters are engaging and heroic.  Even the villains are lovable.  The philosophy sneaks up on the reader, thus making it even more penetrating and enlightening.  I would recommend this one to the young and to the young at heart, to those who want to experience another, delightful way of taking a break from the unremitting anger and fears of a US gone mad.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great reading during our vacation. Involving but not distracting. I love the extra bonus of the actual Language of Flowers dictionary.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|too a class on how to read people and this book really renforces everything that what was said in the class..
B005LAIGSM|5.0|If you loved The Notebook, you'll love The Vow.  A true romance.  You'll fall in love all over again. Must watch!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this app!! Anyone who leaves a bad review clearly doesnt have the right taste in apps in my opinion. The only things i dont like is how the ads on the kindle fire stay there so you have to exit and re-enter and how some people have there words repeated. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! :)
B004UXUX4Q|4.0|Clooney at his best. Good story of the loss of a mom and wife and the revelations that come through dealing with the end.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I started watching this show because the previews for it were so intriguing. I'm now over halfway through the season and I'm still having a hard time getting into it. It's just not as great as I thought it would be. The acting seems mediocre and the plot is not quite as original as it could be. I guess that's because I have seen several other shows who follow the same criteria and use many of the same ideas.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I love it everyone should get it.it is a fun game to play on car trips or just when you are hanging out so get it cause it is fun and free
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|So, I honestly had to stop the movie about midway and resume it the next afternoon because I was watching this home alone and I was too creeped out.  I started seeing things in the shadows as my imagination got the better of me.  This would have been a great date movie...but watching it by myself was a mistake.<br /><br />I really like this movie and will watch it again at Halloween.  It's a new favorite of mine.  What I like about it is that it almost reminds me of a 70s or 80s movie...in that it's about a family that encounters the supernatural and there is not a lot of gratuitous blood and gore.  It's not a slasher movie or a torture porn thing or any of the self-referential garbage that constitutes horror movies in the 2000s and 2010s.  This is more old school horror and it creates a new villain that I hope turns up in other movies under the Sinister banner.<br /><br />I really like just about everything about this movie.  I think the only thing I might have changed would have been the actress who played the mother.  She was randomly British or Australian for no reason...and that threw me.<br /><br />I am not a big fan of Ethan Hawke in general, but I liked him in this.<br /><br />I also liked that there was some mystery to what was happening and that Ethan had to figure it out with the help of a few friends.  That was interesting for me...and I liked that the villain had a real motivation and a purpose to what was happening.
0547884591|5.0|I'm a huge Tim Ferriss fan already, but he really did a good job with this one too. I got several new cookbooks for Christmas, and they're all good for various specific areas of cooking, but this one is the whole package. I can see how it would be great for someone who was new to cooking too, which is one of the goals of the book, but honestly it's great for anyone. I've been preparing meals from each chapter and they've all turned out great and many have given me good ideas on some future dishes.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|First film of its kind. Both beautiful and devastating. A true heartbreaking story about love and it's denial. Ang Lee is a genius of cinema and human emotion on many levels. This film was denied best picture because of it's subject matter by a community in which many of the same people helped build and made it America's royalty. This film in time will be regarded an American classic! A must see for all.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Great investment. The 5th season lacks the spark the first four seasons had but it is still good The first four seasons are AWESOME!!!!
0802473156|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to improve the way they communicate with their partner. Read the book, take the assessment and discuss! Guaranteed results! Very eye opening!
1586210661|2.0|This was the first time I have ever bought a book on CD.  I usually just check them out from the library.  The CD's look brand new but the story skips quite a bit.  I will not buy a book on CD again.  I will buy the regular book because I heard the book itself was fantastic.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|There are interesting developments as the main character changes roles from the defense to prosecutor's side of the courtroom and is teamed with his ex-wife. That, in itself, opens a number of potentially contentious issues. I will recommend this as another Connelly page-turner.
B0001I55OC|5.0|Great I finally got it.  Wooh....oo.  Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.  I would like to thank the customer service who helped get this.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Long-awaited, &#34;The Black Box&#34; provided a few interesting twists and was a worthwhile read, as are all of Michael Connelly's books with Det. Harry Bosch. Past a certain point, there are a couple of predictable character developments, but certainly a few plot twists that allow Harry to survive. This novel has received considerable advance press, and I wondered if this was going to be Connelly/Bosch's magnum opus, but it is on par with previous Bosch (mis)adventures, which is saying quite a bit. Yes, I recommend it and I suspect, since Harry's been on the job for some time, taht the future holds new developments which will see Harry recede to the background as other characters connected to him step to the forefront. This is another link in an interesting chain.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is one of those CD's that you can rock over and over. Adele has been blessed with a soulful voice. Love you Adele.
B001B6PBBK|5.0|I'm so happy I came across this movie. I wasn't to sure about seeing it but I quickly realized it was a good choice. Its not Oscar worthy but it is quirky and I loved it.I recommend this movie for a date. Grab some popcorn and enjoy.
B007ZI06FE|3.0|The premise of this book intrigued me and lured me to buy it. A vampire named Blade, a brilliant woman who does not want his help but needs it, put together in a steampunk universe. I enjoyed this book and the world she built. I want to read more stories in this world. But if you really like steampunk for the descriptions of crazy machines, or you want lore with your vampires and werewolves, this is not the book for you. This is really a straight and simple romance.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Great story all around.  Love, adventure, and flying lessons.  Travel from MN to Brazil, really makes someone want to go see the place.  Maybe it is as beautiful as the cartoon.  This grandma gives this movie and purchase a thumb up!
B005HJU7HA|2.0|This was good enough for the most part - it got to be really repetitous.  A lot of people would enjoy this, it just didn't set all that well with me.
B00466HN6S|4.0|I was expecting a kid movie, but got something different.  Not really an adult movie either.  Family for sure, but with some mature humor.  It is good enough for me to show my grandchildren at Easter time.
1401322786|3.0|Was a gift. No response of content from the receiver. Purchased book because I heard a interview on public radio.
B00354YA2M|4.0|Disclaimer: I am Australian, living in Australia.  To that end I could be considered a little biased when it comes to my view on my &#34;home turf,&#34; so to speak.  Nonetheless, Bill Bryson does a wonderful job of talking about Australia - both the good and the bad - and in a way that will make you laugh.  (Hint: don't read this in a place where the occasional giggle, chortle, or snort would cause you to be looked upon strangely - unless of course you don't care!)<br /><br />Bryson speaks eloquently about Australia, with plenty of humour punctuated by the occasional serious note (consider for example Bryson's coverage of Australia's treatment of its indigenous peoples).  It's a book easily read in a rush, and then re-read as time permits.  And as an Australian, I can vouch for the overall accuracy of Bryson's view of Down Under.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I downloaded this because I'm a fan of the Neo-Blythe dolls.  This game is cute but I wish it had more Blythe in it.  This is a game where you build a town for pets and collect them.  There are mini games that involve cleaning your pet,  feeding them, and playing with them.  It's very cute,  although perhaps a bit too childish for someone my age.  A child would love this.<br />It is sad to see so many 1 star ratings for this game, due to a lack of knowledge on how free games and tablets work.  If you are a parent and do not want your child to spend hundreds of dollars on this game,  or any other game,  you should change the settings on your tablet so that all real money purchases require a password.  As soon as I started the game the first time  it warned about real cash money purchases,  so the onus is on the parent to safeguard against such things.  A child or adult is fully capable of playing the game by earning things in the game,  although some items can only really be bought with real cash money.  If you don't want your kids to make expensive purchases, safeguard against it,  or don't let your children use tablets.  There's always the alternative of buying them the Nintendo Littlest Pet Shop game instead.
B00AWFEBDK|4.0|I was aware of Jared Diamond from his other books, notably Collapse, and Guns, Germs and Steel; to that end I had no hesitation in buying this book sight unseen.  I'm happy to say that Diamond didn't disappoint; his insights from working with &#34;primitive&#34; (primarily New Guinean) communities make for instructive reading.<br /><br />While there is no doubt that modern society has significant advantages over societies of previous ages, there are still many lessons that can be learned from our past, and Diamond does a great job of highlighting many of these.<br /><br />I recommend reading with an open mind, as some of Diamond's insights can offend the more sensitive reader.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Both my 5 year old and I love this game. I got bored with all of the Angry Birds versions after awhile as the principle is really all the same from level to level and game to game. This one is thoughtful in a similar but different way. Very fun, and thought-provoking rather than mind-numbing. No problems with software at all on my Kindle.
0765325950|5.0|It was a good read i feel that it tied up most of the loose ends but I wonder how robert would have done it
B005M5PER2|5.0|The give and take between Steve and Dann-o is hilarious.  I enjoyed the original, however this is superior.  The only negative is this continuing saga with Wu Fat is too much.  To be honest I have never enjoyed the recurring villians in any show.  Of all the characters on the show my favorite is Kamekona - what a guy - he knows how to live.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|That end was completely unexpected!!<br />I could always count on Ridley to still be evil. She never changes. Can't wait for the next.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I am a spider man fan and this game was great. the missions were awesome and I loved free roam. this is a must get for all spider man fans. the only thing I didnt like was that after you beat the game it sometimes starts the game over by itself which ducks. gameloft please make an update
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing. My daughter loves to show it off to her friends! I really recommend this game to horse lovers.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Led me down the path of a combination fact and fiction.  A beautiful love story to boot.  Totally enjoyable and easy to recommend.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a very good dictionary it helps me to find words. It also helps my family when they use my Kindle Fire.
0765325950|5.0|Gripping, horrifying at times, satisfying, amazing.  Was it perfect? No.  But the conclusion to this 14 novel epic series was very well done.  Enough surprises, plot twists  and tension to make it difficult to put down, enough tragedy to make it believable, and enough answers to fulfill its promise. Can I point a finger at parts I would have wished to be done a little differently? Sure.  But lets face it. Has there ever been a perfect book written, especially in the time frame alotted and under the adverse conditions of changing authors in midstream of the series?  I think it was an amazing accomplishment.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks of course is amazing, but this truly is an amazing love story that will really pull at your heart strings.  It's a love story with a little edginess.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|IT WAS SO AWESOME! IT WAS SO DETAILED! I RECOMMEND THIS AMAZING BOOK TO LITTLE KIDS AND POSSIBLY OLDER KIDS!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|GOOD for learning and a fun activity to do for your free time. Five star book. It deserves its rating.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Was an excellent book and couldn't put it down. Very easy read. Needed to resolve mom's issue  know too many men like that
B005NKGEP2|3.0|The story here is what keeps you going, despite the fact the author skips around in the telling. Events don't move sequentially but instead jump back and forth and the reader has to pay closer attention to  the place in time the events occur. You sometimes have to suspend belief, as when the main female character Kate seems to act in ways that are not consistent with her years of training as a covert CIA operative. In the conclusion, her husband's behavior is somewhat difficult to believe. In fact, his whole involvement in the \\"reveal\\" at the end seems somewhat like from the back seat.  But the book was a page turner, well crafted, and kept me interested enough to keep me reading to the end.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was just lukewarm about this novel.  It just seemed hard to believe; didn't convince me.  Can't understand why it's so popular!
B0061C1NQ6|5.0|I regret now that I wated this long to read Gorky Park. I actually started with its sequel, Polar Star and read the rest of the Arkady Renko books in order; they were all great. I didn't bother to read Gorky Park until now for the worst reason imagine able: I had seen the movie version. What a mistake. Had I known I only known then what I was missing...
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and really convenient for my kindle.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Oh and its free...can't beat that :-)
B009GGWX5E|5.0|The music is good. There was another live concert Made In Japan, with the original Deep Purple members, better, but this one is just as good.
B005MJFA2W|4.0|It is written by a Nobel Price-winner so you would not think it to be too easy to read and understand. But it is, surprisingly enough, anyhow, and really fascinating reading. But don't read too much at one time, one hour at a time is enough, at least it was for me.<br /><br />I recommend it to everybody, who is interested to know why we behave in the way we do.
B0011UJMK2|4.0|I gave this book four stars because it had good characters and geographical and historical settings.  It would have earned five stars except for the fact the story lines and characters get a bit muddled over the many years this book covers.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The first 10 pages hooked me a week ago, all provided by the free preview on kindle.  Bought and read wool- omnibus in 6 days on every spare moment I had. The world of the silo is complex and simple to imagine all at once.  If you are 12 or older and have ever enjoyed the twilight zone, star trek or mad max read wool.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Howey
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was amazing, enthralling, full of life and humor.  In the face of such sadness for a writer to be able to express joy without it being unreal and cheesy is pretty incredible.  A great read.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|One of the best new shows out there, and one of the best book-to-series adaptations I've seen since LOTR.  There is lots of sex, nudity, violence, gore, etc, which I'm not usually a fan of, but in GoT, it makes the characters and their flaws and ambitions all the more real.<br />The second season is even better than the first!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this very much.  It is a good app with options.  I love being able to try different set ups.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|What can I say about Breaking Bad Season 2? Well, if you've seen Season 1, you know what the show is about. In Season 2 the guys get deeper into it, and of course Jesse screws things up every time as usual, because, well, he's Jesse.  You just have to see it.  :)
B009O2XY12|5.0|I enjoy this game very much. It allows me to use strategies and feel rewarded when I pass a level.  I think all ages would like this.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|The previews for this movie made it seem like an exciting story about a pilot and flying. Also the drama of his legal problems. The movie has a ridiculous amount of screen time for apple products; there is a 20 second segment of the screen of an iphone. The movie was a little slow for me; the beginning was five minutes of denzel in bed and a naked woman walking around. I thought this would be a movie similar to Unstoppable with pilots instead of engineers. Despite the drawbacks there are positives to the movie. The airplane segments were correct and possible in real life. The sound track was okay, but the same style of music the entire time. I enjoyed the parts about the accident and his legal battle, but everything else was boring to me. I might reccomend this to a friend who likes slow, alcoholic dramas.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great way to complete a puzzle without having to dump out a box and worry about the dog or cat messing things up.  Love it!!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My kids (2 year old boy and 4 year old girl) LOVE angry birds. I loved that this ad free version showed up as a free download when I went in the App Store! We downloaded it on a Nabi 2. Works perfect!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I am 53 years old and felt this game was geared more to the younger app users.  I do not doubt that my grandkids would like it.
B00866JL96|5.0|Awesome movie!!! I loved this movie and it came in excellent shape and record time too if your a Nicholas Sparks fan this is a great  movie to buy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can I say...I love my facebook and find this is a great way to catch up without having to go downstairs to my computer and log on...etc.  Nice!!
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I didn't think I would have a virus issue on an android device [toshiba thrive].  Since installation the software has warned me about several dangerous sites
B0063IH60K|5.0|What can I say...I love solitaire and this app offers many options.  This is great to fill in shorts blocks of time with a quick game.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Music is good and Alicia's voice is superb!  She keeps putting out hit songs and this CD is no exception.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have always loved Spider and I like that it is a quick game that can be played during short wait periods or just to fill in a few minutes.  FUN!!
B009RWRIKM|4.0|PINA the movie.  It's not the 3D version, but it's just as well - it's a fine film, and one to not be reckoned with
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My seatmate on my last flight recommened this game and I have not been sorry I listened to her.  It is fun and progressive.  Thanks!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I just couldn't put it down...grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go all the way to the end
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|&#34;Mixing Secrets&#34; is a wonderfully written book, both for the straight-up beginner as well as for those who have some working knowledge of audio engineering. Mike Senior untangles the seemingly chaotic workflow of the top mix engineers and outlines the processes that, with practice, will lead to higher quality mixes.<br /><br />The reader is lead through the process of identifying problems and various approaches to solving problems starting with the most basic to more advanced tools and techniques. Along with explaining how to identify the problem and techniques that might be used to solve the problem, the author provides lists of cost effective plugins that may not be bundled with your DAW software. Each section of the book ends with a task list and summary of the decision making process behind each task.<br /><br />I have read through this book more than once now and I also have been using it as a reference while I am working on projects. I would highly recommend taking notes and creating an outline of the tasks presented for your own quick reference. I have been both a hobbyist and, at times, a paid professional in the audio business over the course of 15 years and have found &#34;Mixing Secrets&#34; to be a very valuable resource. It has both validated some of my instincts and illuminated glaring issues and abuses I have developed over the years.<br /><br />This is not a reference for aural physics, acoustics, or tracking. If you looking for a such a book, look elsewhere. &#34;Mixing Secrets&#34; is a very easily understood presentation of the goals of mixing and the processes by which to meet those goals. Highly recommended.
B003X5UDEW|5.0|This is one of the greatest chinese films. I wonder why Amazon don;'t have it in Digital copy for purchase. Please Amazon, if you are reading this. please make it available. I am buying it.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I am never disappointed with a book by Nora Roberts, and this book is no exception. The character development is so superb, I want to read another book with these characters so I can find out what happens next in their lives! Intrigue, danger, steamy romance, and laugh-out-loud humor serve to make this story a very exciting, fulfilling read!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really wanted to read this book before viewing the movie, I'm glad I did.  The writing flows beautifully and its hard to put down, awesome job!
B00BETX5PS|1.0|Even with very high speed Internet (40 meg download) movie stopped and sputtered throughout. Total waste of money to use amazon streaming. Want my money back!!
0316023744|5.0|This book is the comprehensive overview of the war.  It makes historical figures come alive and definitely shows the global scope of the war.  The descriptions of the devastation are vivid and moving.  Beevor shows how all humanity suffered so much because of this war.  He is very fair minded in his presentation of the difficult military and political decisions made by leaders.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Very good to help teach gardening concepts.  My 4 year old really enjoys playing it and it keeps her entertained.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Surprisingly funny with a lot going on throughout the movie. Should be a Halloween classic for all ages. Adam Sandler's best movie in quite sometime.
B003UM6MPC|5.0|I love the story that James Marsters shares at conventions: that Buffy Writer/Director Joss Whedon gave the cast members a cassette with the music on it... and they thought he'd gone insane. After much arguing, despair, and hiring of vocal coaches, what resulted is a spectacular episode that sticks with fans for a lifetime. From the hilarious 'I've Got a Theory' to the love song 'Under Your Spell' to Spike's rock-and-roll ballad 'Rest In Peace' to the amazing group number 'Walk Through the Fire', this music is a must-have for Whedonites.
B006M4RN3U|3.0|Even though I liked more than just one song, I don't think they should have beat out Mumford and Sons.
B003B02O14|4.0|Patrick Lanigan is the master planner in this intriguing & well thought out novel.  Made me never wanting to stop reading it!
B008NW67E0|5.0|YouTube videos of Sigh No More songs got us hooked. So very happy they finally won an award for their talents!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I wish it was not so expensive although cheaper than iTunes. Fun watching the season in my own time at home.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watched the first series on line and could not wait to see season 2! Awesome series! Watched season 3 and now impatiently waiting for season 4!!!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Everyone should try this app. It is very relaxing and peaceful and helps me unwind and clear my head after a stressful day. I like the different sound combinations depending on my mood.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Takes my mind off my problems.  Thanks itreeGamer. A good game you don't have to pay for or need other people to move ahead.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|I very much enjoyed the entire set.  Wll done and not just great acting but great direction and sets.  A bargain.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun and addicting. challenging. takes time when you run out of diamonds. refuse to buy diamonds so it will take awhile to beat.
B000002B30|5.0|Love this CD, but.......although all the songs are great, I was a bit disappointed that I'm On Fire wasn't on this one. But certainly worth getting, as all of his CD's are!
0399160450|5.0|a great sequel in the ongoing saga of the ryan family and their assorted friends nd enemies . keep it coming
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Well, a good story (ok not the best of th best but still...), a good gameplay and new game +<br />I don't need anything else in game: it's a must-have for every vita owners
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game Is perfect but it is to Mutch points needed to get a new game this is really fun
0385335997|5.0|My wife loves these books!  There are seven and this is the third.  A women is transported to 1700's Scotland and finds a guys she falls in love with.  The stories goes between now and then as the overall story unfolds.  Not my cup of tea but my wife said she would read all of them.  They have some hot chapters apparently!  If you like these kind of books, these are great, according to my wife.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I really liked this series. My daughter had recommended it to me and I was glad I was able to see it on my kindle.  I watched it while<br />I exercised on my bike.  I just love Jessica Lange.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Great story but hard to watch because of the destructive nature of the main character.  Denzel is great as usual.  Not an uplifting movie but worth watching anyway just for the story and acting.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|As the economy twists & turns, we can find our best laid financial plans have gone to seed. Even though reality resists easy change, while we jump through life's hoops we love movies about people who find ways to raise their own hopes & circumstances. This is such a film. A repertory production, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel gives us a group of senior citizens (some of the finest British actors working today) who find themselves unable to afford decent housing in their native Britain. Consequently, they buy into a  dream: a seniors only residence in India. Though initially it doesn't live up to it's promise, the dream is fulfilled in rather odd ways for the characters &, for the viewers in every way -- as long as the viewer likes character pieces,  laughing, & can live without blood, car chases, & torture for 124 minutes.
1609611543|5.0|Dr. Davis has done a fantastic job of explaining how important it is to choose the right carbohydrates.  He exlains why wheat, in particular, contributes to not just weight gain but overall decline in health.  It is not enough just to find a diet to help you lose weight, especially at the expense of what is happening to your health.  With this book, you will lose weight while preventing heart disease and diabetes.  Once you are off of the wheat, you will eat less and feel better!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read. Phenomenal. I saw the movie first but it made no difference in the reading. One of the most relatable books and so well written. It's heartbreaking and sweet and just one of a kind. Love it
B0034DGPEU|4.0|The Kitchen House exists at the intersection where good fiction, imaginative characterizations and historical research reside. Interesting storyline. Page turner.
0823013626|5.0|I use polymer clay professionally, and have for more than 25 years. Donna offers tips that are still new to me. I'm delighted with the book.
B00AJLHU3K|5.0|Thompson's spot-on lyrical expose' of the eternal treachery of women (and the male need to enable their chicanery) make this a difficult listen for the \\"fairer\\" sex\\", I imagine.<br /><br />It's hard for me to listen to some of these songs, because they are so real.<br /><br />Misogynistic? Listen and decide for yourself.<br /><br />I heard a series of honest from-the-heart revelations of a lifetime of female-inflicted hurts, with some scintillating musical accompaniment to make the medicine go down.
B008MEM24S|3.0|My 4 year old loves this game. The game is straight forward but tricky. The biggest drawback and the reason for 3 stars instead of 5, is that there is a whole section of game play that must be purchased. The extra section costs more than the game! @@
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I discovered this guy on chasejarvis.com/live and was hooked immediately. The book is full of nuggets and have had great success with the handful of attempts to restructure the way I tell stories and communicate.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits honestly is one of the best shows on tv right now - the character development, drama and storytelling offer a highly entertaining law drama the bends the genre and leaves you wanting more,
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|Good show quality was questionable at times, but could be the internet connection.  Give it a try second season is better
B002Y0TGOU|1.0|I ordered this movie in &#34;HD&#34; off my Roku XD box on a cable connection which is considered &#34;high-speed&#34;.  About 1 hour into the movie, the connection basically stopped, the video became choppy, and basically unwatchable.  Ruined the date and movie night.<br /><br />It also was not in HD after the first hour and was in what seemed like a poor video resolution as it definitely wasn't clear.  More than once, it blacked out and said it was &#34;loading&#34;.<br /><br />The movie is fantastic, but the poor performance of the network or the delivery mechanism through Roku ruined the experience.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It dealt with some still &#34;touchy&#34; subjects, but Grisham handled it brilliantly.  His explanation about how much fun it was to do little research was great too!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is totally worth the money. I wish it had the<br />same update version as Pc but if it keeps up on the updates that would be cooler, I want enchantments!
1897299214|3.0|Try to keep expectations on level for this one: it's a graphic novel chronicling a two month animation project.  The gratuitous mountain of critical praise piled on the first few pages and back cover are really unneeded. There's no great revelation, no expounding truths to be found at the end and certainly no scholarly work was done. It was a job and he did it complaining most of the time. The rest of the time was spent criticizing transparent inefficiencies and consequently drowning sorrows away in peculiarly copious amounts of alcohol. The narration is predictably wry and cynical.<br /><br />That isn't to say that \\"Pyongyang\\" is a bad read. Far from it. The illustrator is charmingly talented and wittingly depicts his unique, sheltered experience. He's astute without being cocky and meek without being self-deprecating. He's a regular guy whose snarky comments would probably come from 90% of us if we were in his shoes. After all, he isn't working for an NGO or some humanitarian cause; he's an animator working on cartoons. His observations are just that.<br /><br />This isn't the latest groundbreaking piece from Andrei Lankov or the latest controversial drivel from Bruce Cumings; it's a graphic novel aimed a wide audience and it's fun. Worth a read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I took so much from this book. Such an inspiration. My new favourite book. Thank you Colleen it was amzing
B009JBZH54|5.0|Very much enjoyed all 3 movies in the series.  The movies lack a bit of the dark, comic book style that the originals have, but still well done.  Christian Bale is a superb Batman.
B00AKFGSPQ|4.0|Nice departure from other \\"Holmes incarnations\\".<br />Fresh story lines, often with last moment twist during last 5-10 minutes of an episode.<br />Watson could have been given more time and exposure in my view - Lucy Liu definitely can handle it.<br />Dialogs fall behind Castle (my favorite in this genre) but story lines get close.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so much fun I have always wanted a horse this game rocks horses. are sweet
B007U4DIM6|4.0|I really liked the 1st and second in this line , this one is way cute , but it did have me shaking my head over a few things said in the movie..I would not let a really young child , that is starting to question things see this until a little bit older..But that's just me ..Overall the franchise is on my to own list , I just hope there is an improvement over the script writing..~!~
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Roger good buddy it was an out standing move Ive booked flights for all my family members.Please Check Idaho for liquer bootlegging because some guy  who stole a dead kids ID 24 years ago was busted here in Boise Idaho and It seems we havent had a sealed bottle in the STATE RUN liquor stores. Does any one know the Liggett family? And These people pretend to be amazon market Child porn.
B004LROMWU|5.0|I have watched this a few times , and the special affects are amazing..I however like a more real feel to my entertainment , but as this style is becoming more of a television option..This is a good start..I heard season 2 was or is going to follow more of a patterned<br />series , instead  of leaving you to wonder it will feed you some very important tidbits of how things came to be the way they are , and who can you trust..~!~<br /><br />I will be purchasing the next season , for my very good friend..~!~
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use, clean look, FREE and it works...each and EVERY time!  Other apps could take a lesson from this/these designers!  FYI...I have this on a Kindle Fire...works like a charm.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I usually don't like scary { horror films , and such } but from the first day I saw this I was in love..When Kim Manners was writing and producing { he also had a hand in Charlies Angels the series } it had a very campy feel , with the demon / monster story bound to strike a cord  of empathy or sympathy ,with a great mix of humor...We now own all seven of the series , but I did feel that with Manner's passing it left the series without a real direction since a new viewpoint was trying to be made { seasons 4-6 } It now is back on track , with I believe a new set of eyes and voice..Kudos to a great series..~!~
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was very good. But I must warn anyone that plans on buying it that it isn't a light read. It centers around a teenage girl, the abuse she faced as a child and the love she finds within herself and her boyfriend. Very good writing and it's believable.
B001LF347E|5.0|You know, the SyFy channel has had wicked awesome series, Merlin, being my favorite at this time.  I just feel sick when they CAN all of the good stuff our syfy friends come to love.  Andromeda... Stargate Universe was the last one they canned that \\"hurt my feelings and ticked me off\\"!  Merlin is on a roll, but it is said to be the last season!  WHY?!?!?!?  I just don't get it.  The channel gets something really interesting going and them BAM!  I can't see it anymore as my provider doesn't carry it?  I missed so much of Merlin last year it was heart wrenching.  I am glad to see that I am able to purchase all of the DVD's.... hurry up tax refund... I gotta have these!!!
B007EECSFA|3.0|Outstanding use of vocabulary  Way too long to maintain interest in middle chapters.  Interesting and<br />surprising ending.  Difficult to keep all the names straight and read back and forth in time.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|This is a simple vinyl case that has no graduated spaces inside for standing up the Kindle.  The case feels a little harder and less bulky than the others ones that have a more cushy feel.  This is for those who like no frills.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Wow. This book was incredible and not at all what I thought it would be. Not to mention the surprise ending.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|The movie was alright. But the actual event is the only inspiring part about the movie. Everyone in the movie does an &#34;alright&#34; job. There are some moments of impressive acting/shots in the movie. But for the most part the real life story is the only thing that has my attention.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|my granddaughters like this never read the book or seen the movie but I may as it is greared to kids and that is the population I work with.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Thought I already reviewed this.<br /><br />Started streaming in HD, Amazon halfway through said that our bandwidth was too small and then converted it to sub-standard quality to stream.<br /><br />Great movie though.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had to read it for school and I actually like it. great history about black people and how they were treated when they got sick in the 30 and all the way up to the 60's.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book! The characters a messed up in the head big time but it made for a great story. The sex was hot and often! I can't wait for the next book. Im not into the angel series by this author, but Crossfire rocks!
B009VB7P6G|1.0|never read it or seen the movie, it must be good though as most Disney movies are pretty good and worth watching.
B0049VVE7Y|3.0|The connection was never good enough to actually stream in HD.  I end up in standard so I could watch.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|Now that season 3 is over, it is obvious that the entire series is a winner!  I caught on to the series during season 2 so this was a good way to catch up on the story and characters.  Leave it to UK. Public Television, and Masterpiece Theater to give us another goodie!
0452295548|5.0|In my experience people like to loosely say left brain is for analytics and right brain is for creativity.  That's loosely rubbish.  In this book Jill explains what happens when part of her left brain stopped working.  It's a fascinating tale and one that makes you realize the beauty of just being part of the world with everyone else.  A big thing I took away was being conscious of the energy you bring into the room.  Quieten down those left brains people!
B00AFEY354|4.0|Looks like a 'teen' movie but it's not!! Good story and well acted! Enjoyed it! Not for 'action' movie lovers.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A very good series!  It is a great glimpse into the early 1900's. I definitely recommend this series for age groups.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|A story that is unforgettable and heartbreaking! Masterfully told! One that you will read from start to finish not wanting to put it down.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|This is marginally the best produced Harry Potter film, with a compelling story, stunning visuals and special effects, superb acting and a fine turn behind the camera from David Yates. This is the first of two parts of course...and it was actually sad to contemplate there would only be one more film in the franchise. We have watched the three protagonists, Harry, Ron and Hermione, mature as characters from mere children to young adults; and we have watched Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson mature into superb actors. They deliver their best performances yet in this film. Many of the characters from past Harry Potter films also appear in this one, with the same actors playing them; and some die in the battle w/Voldemort and his dark forces; but don't be looking for a lot of facetime for any character except for the three protagonists. The exception is Voldemort, played again by Ralph Fiennes; because his presence is felt and visualized by Harry in addition to scenes that feature him in actual dialogue with other characters. You may remember from HALF BLOOD PRINCE that Voldemort has divided his soul into multiple units and each is stored in a Horcrux. Each Horcrux must be found and destroyed in order to destroy Voldemort. Harry and his two cohorts have already found and destroyed two Horcruxes in prior installments. Most of this film involves a search and destroy mission for the third, while avoiding Voldemort and his hoard of deatheaters and snatchers. The film has prelude written all over it, which of course it is; and it leaves us hungry for the next and final installment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It's nice to watch a show with great writing and acting, without all the drugs, sex and disrespect to other people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is the best game I have ever played in my life! It is like temple run but better! Its free so I suggest that anyone who has time should get this game.
B005LAII62|5.0|Loved it.Watched it with my grand daughter .I will keep it for many years. I have 3 grandaughters that will watch it with me
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great edge of your seat book!  Hope Preston and Child keep writing about agent Pendergras.  Can't wait for the next one.
B008YWY0HK|1.0|Brave Dvd<br />it did not work in any dvd player that my house hold had and the case was all broken
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I don't always care for Nicholas Sparks' books, sometimes find them boring, but I thought this one was better than most, really enjoyed it.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I just watched it last night and it is the most loving adorable movie.It is great for the young and old alike.
B0091REZMW|3.0|A great game! I enjoy it immensely. Unfortunately you become so caught up that you continue to spend money. It's addictive in the worst way.
B008476HBM|5.0|What a fantastic book which was brought to life by the BBC series starring Colin Firth.  Now I can hear them talking and I just love this book.  I can visualize my English ancestors in the village.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This made me cry but all those witty comments and smart assness made this book well worth the read. I agree there are only two emotions Love and Fear.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I hate this app in the description it said that you can use your own music but you can't when you try it takes you to an upgrade to buy the same app with one different thing
B0013Q1VJO|5.0|When I discovered this movie it was by accident. I nearly flipped past it. However happily I paused and was hooked! This is one of the most cherished  sets in our movie collection. Truly you have to see the movie to enjoy the music performed in context with the times.Superior actors and singers, it was a lucky,lucky accident!! I could watch this movie several times a year and it would never grow old.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This is the best thing that happened to my ears... after ofcourse, the ATHM50s. Together, they'll give you countless eargasms. A must have product for an audiophile.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Seriously, what else has to be said It's Garth at his best. A collection of songs that bring into focus a time in my life  that was unforgetable.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game. I enjoy it because it's pretty easy and you can get coins very fast.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|OK, I haven't seen all the movies up for best picture Oscar, but I've seen a few and for my money Les Mis is definitely the best.  Supremely emotional movie.  Great acting, a story for the ages.  The story is truly a masterpiece, so the movie has a lot going for it from the get-go.  Read the book, but had never seen the play.  It is very, very important to enunciate clearly if you are going to sing the lines.  My old ears had no trouble making out what was being sung.  A very well produced film.  Five stars for sure.  Best film I've seen this year.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Are you a fan of littlest pet shop?<br />You can see the different pets.And you can make your own town.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this seek and find game is more than your average play. it has so much to do that is more than just searching. it keeps you involved with other players around the world. really is fun. love this game!!!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This application is perfect for lounging in bed and doing some finishing touches on a spreadsheet or other thing you forgot about.  I can get the files I need where ever I am.
B009JTCBLE|3.0|I really liked the last record but this one just doesn't have the punch of the last one. It sounds like they just didn't have the same energy they did on the last one - songwriting wasn't as good - music did not sound inspired.
B002R88G5E|4.0|A powerful and often heart-wrenching depiciton of life in modern Afghanistan.<br /><br />Beautifully written to spark a mix of emotions and promote understanding.
B009NCM248|5.0|I've been listening to this straight for almost a month. Great songwriting, great vocals and great music - definately one of the best records I've heard in years. I heard this is the first in a 2-part effort and I'm looking forward to part 2.
0061122416|3.0|Although Paulo Coelho may lack the sophistication and depth of other literary geniuses, I found that the simplicity of 'The Alchemist' is what made it powerful.<br /><br />A thought-provoking journey.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|this app is far, far superior to the musicplayer which comeswith the kindle. even the freeversion has an equalizer (kindle has none). the creator of this app is super resonsive and easy to work with.<br /><br />i purchased the premium version (it has 3 graphic equalizers plus auto download of album art plus several other features not found onthe free version)but it had huge ads blocking the screen when in landscape mode. Company spokesperson said Amazon was given a fix for this problem but has yet to offer it. I give this a 3 star rating due to the ads on the premium version but will change it to 5 stars as soon as the software fix is available.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|really true evrething about valor, but the shipped service broke the case on my dvd, any way the movie its working good
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have to admit I wasn't expecting much, but damn..pretty good.  It was very funny with lots of action. My only complaint was the use of the metric system.  I hate the metric system.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time. Great acting. Dealt with some serious and sensitive topics via humor but none over-shadowed the other.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I think they should make one with a whale it would be called whale waters where the candy swings on the rope and then the whale splashes its tail in the water the wave will push the candy over to omnom
B006PTNQGU|5.0|My husband and I and our 3 children loved this movie.  The family is extremely wealthy, but they give their son lots of attention, and they're very generous with their money and the employees that work at their factory. And the butler ends up being one of the heroes of the day. But the real kicker is at the end when the bad guys break into their &#34;treasure&#34; and you get to find out what they consider to be treasure.  Sweet!  There was one time toward the end of the movie when John Laroquette's character said the s___ word.  I think it was when he was up on a ladder or scaffolding and ready to fall backwards.
B000JIHP88|2.0|we bought this mobile for my baby and unfortunately baby never had a chance to see how it is spinning, because it always stops right after big leave goes down. Those big leaves make stop all toys from spinning. I tried to take leaves out- and it started to work better, however we liked the idea of toys and leaves. Music is boring for this mobile, we have same theme play mat and it has better music selection. The only thing that I actually liked- colorful toys, these colors made my baby keep staring and wondering.
B003Y5H574|4.0|Overall this movie really surprised me, with it's depth of story, romance, and comedy.  I had no idea when I started watching it, that it would turn out to be so good.  Plus they snunk a cute love story in there when I wasn't looking! What was up with that! :)<br />The story follows a middle aged man, during the crisis and aftermath of his marriage falling apart, and how he picks up the pieces to try and build and new life that includes dating.  He gets hooked by a real ladies man, younger guy, who ends up showing him \\"the ropes\\" so to speak on how to talk to women, helps him with a make-over, etc.<br />It was a unique story, that had me totally buying on the homely attitude of the main character.  I felt for him, and wanted to see him get his life back, rise again from the ashes of emotional despair.  And the young ladies man's character, was perfect, just the right amount of honesty and supportive to kick the main character's butt into gear.  Their relationship turns from a mentoring position, to more of friendship, and then back to a mentoring relationship when their roles switch towards the end.<br />Really good cast, fun and believable characters, cute dialogue that had me laughing, and overall a really good story where you see the character's grow and evolve, with a twist of ending!
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a tantalizing read that keeps one's interest. I enjoyed the not so perfect relationship between the two main characters. I give it a four star rating as the ex lover dynamic is overplayed and I tire of the special friend that's a girl. Otherwise it's great. Would recommend to those that enjoy a love/lust filled novel.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book as much as the first one. We learn more secrets about the caster world! You have to read it!
B00863CMZE|5.0|I love the music, love the product.  I like everythinf about this live cd.  Technically, this CD is a replacement because the 1st one I received would not play all the way through on my Blu-ray player.  the last two tracts digitally skip and get progressively worse as it plays.  Amazon was very helpful in replacing it for me, and I received this one and the same thing happened.  I can get i9t to play all the way on my computer, but never in the Blu-Ray.  There must be something in the manufacture of this CD my player doesn't like.  I've never had a problem with any other CDs playing on it, and I can get it to play elsewhere.  It's a mystery...but it's a great recording and I would recommend it to all Blackmore, Rainbow, Celtic, Rock genre fans.  It's very good!
B009GED3HS|1.0|Jumped the shark.  The jokes aren't funny, anyone other than NPH isn't trying and we will never meet the kid's mother.
1781164150|5.0|The art is amazing and the book is worth the buy.  I was looking forward more for the conceptual and preproduction art and it doesn't disappoint.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book hit home to me.... It shows for everything good thing that happens there's a bad... very realistic and beautifully written.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Had never heard of this show until they announced around Christmas time about it.  Didn't realize it wasn't new and has been on for years.  A VERY well done Sci-Fi show that totally keeps your interest going.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|It would be perfect was it not for a small defect in manufacture that mine had. One of the small plastic clamps that control de shoulder-straps length was sewn inverted  and thus one strap is always slipping out. As for the compartments and space, it is perfect my new canon a few lenses and all the backup gear I need fit like a glove in that thing.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|The movie is really about this guy's drinking (and denial) problems. Not about the flight, or the subsequent investigation. I thought the trailer was misleading.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I don't much care for Mr. King's writing style in his novels, but you can't argue with his prolific publishing success.  His memoir on how he came to be &#34;formed&#34; as a writer as well as his methods are invaluable.  He spikes the narrative with enough humor to make you forget you are reading instructional information.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I have never reviewed a book, but this one is worth a little time.  Doris Kearns Goodwin examined so many authentic documents and letters to create this well conceived work of nonfiction.  The gems she chose to include had me highlighting  often.  I started to read the book in paperback (Costco purchase).  It wasn't long before I downloaded it onto my Kindle for a few reasons.  First, I was finding a considerable amount of words that I chose to have defined.  Second, I wanted to easily highlight the jewels of wisdom.  Third, I was going on a trip and wanted to reduce bulk.  It's long, but deserves to be read slowly.  I truly appreciated this fine work and will read others by this author.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun to play. Nice sequel to the first temple run! Love the different abilities each character has. Don't lime the mine though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i know the movie ratings for this one pretty much tanked but the book was really good.  how can you not love Nicholas Sparks?!?  the story line was fairly predictable but you know that going in and can just sit back and enjoy a feel good book.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This product was exactly as it was listed. I was very very pleased with it. It was in perfect condition, brand new.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We need to have all the stuff that Xbox minecraft has and if that doesn't happen everyone  Will be sad..
B002G1K82Q|5.0|This was exactly as it was described. I bought his as a present and it was appreciated. It was in prefect conditon.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game so much that I bought the bord game and the one on my kindle and the one on my dsi.
B0015DROBO|5.0|the story rolls out the cause and effect pretty smoothly. The details are interesting to follow. I wish the book had a readable map<br /><br />We think Larsson was ahead of his time re hacking. Now a days the kids are doing it.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This book is very intense from the start. It really describes the event real well and I finished it within a couple of days
B001NLKT60|5.0|For some reason the negative coments re Salander's abilities considering her schooling bugs me. I've met people in several<br /><br />countries that could wow us with their mental abilities. Larson wove that very well through the tale. All the rest is an interesting maze
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Ever since I first got this app my daughter just loves it, she reminds me every couple of ours to let her check on her horsey lol<br />Overall I think it's a great game and would recommend it (:
B008B92U32|1.0|It makes no attempt to make the swap look seamless at all. It looks like a chooppy cut and paste. Rotation is awkward and not fully functional. Even if you rotate a mask,the face is still aligned the same way.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book. If  you know someone who has been in an abusive relationship this isa must read. I found so much of myself in this book. Hint : Keep Kleenex handy !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's so cool and addictive I can't stop playing you should buy this game so addicting so fun so awesome!!!!!!!!!!
B008HK3XU4|4.0|Love this case. Only reason for 4 stars is you do have to keep the case open to charge.  I use it consistently and never worry about it falling over. Also love the color!  Definitely recommend.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This application is a must for all platforms.  Great product, easy to use and easy to run on my tablet.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Fun having Corey meet Brenner.  Lots of twists and great characters.  Left us up in the air for another sequel.  Some good sarcastic quips and some not as good.  Wrapping the whole plot around using John and Kate as bait but really having no interaction between them and Panther seemed hard to get into.  Lion books were much more personal in interaction between Coreys and villain.<br />Worthwhile read but not the best.
0743496736|4.0|When you have a book that bridges multi-generational family members, you know it is a good one. This is just another example of Jodi's great writing.
1582406723|5.0|I bought this for my Grandson, but I think I read it before he did. I love the Walking Dead series, probably as much as my Grandson does! Very entertaining.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I enjoy the recipes, home decor ideas! Pinterest has ideas for everyone! I have tried many of the recipes and they are delish!
0525953728|5.0|I ordered this for my husband. He finished the entire book in just over one day. He was very impressed. He said he thought the information was presented in a very understandable way. H really enjoyed reading it.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love this app beacause... it is really cool. And it is really<br />funny when you shoot pinecons at the anamals.And it<br />is really cool beacause it just is.
0062238868|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband. He said it was very interesting. He couldn't seem to put it down and would recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've become highly addicted to Scandal. It was natural for me. Fast paced, action packed, and enough drama to keep me fully engaged for a full hour. If someone had told me I'd feel the same way about Downton Abbey I would've told them to Just Say No to Drugs! Okay, so it's a different kind of action...it is engaging nonetheless. I watched the entire three seasons over the course of about 5 days thanks to Amazon Prime! It was like the good book that you can't put down. Love this series...
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book is a must have if you're planning to publish on Kindle. It covers everything you'll need to know on how to format your book on Kindle.
B0000549B0|5.0|It was one of his finest movies, and I really enjoy having it among my collection.... thank you for it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not only is the sexual dialogue intriguing, but the actual story line makes for a great read! Couldn't put it down...read all 3 books in 5 days!!!
B00005JNTX|5.0|This movie was scorching HOT!  Why?  Five words:  Jessica Alba and Rosario Dawson.  Also, my boys Bruce Willis and Michael Clarke Duncan were on point.  Action packed, dark and sexy theme.  A must see movie.  I've added this one to my home movie library.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|nice to sit and relax or go to sleep by. very peaceful. easy to make your own blend of sounds.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love zombie killing movies and this one was just funny as hell.  Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Kate Ashfield were all on point in this movie.  I've added it to my home movie library.
B0067TGSOK|4.0|This book is not only very motivating and exactly what I needed to read right now, but also very informative. If you want the freedom and control of running your own business, this book is totally for you. I can't wait to live like most of the entrepreneurs I read about in the $100 Startup. Get this book.
B00007GZR5|5.0|The best movie Robin Williams ever stared in.  In my opinion.  Thought provoking.  Outstanding special effects.  Tells a story of how deep love for another can really flow.  A must see movie.
1616550414|5.0|This is a must-have for any Zelda fan. Containing the official chronology of the series, Hyrule Historia is truly remarkable. With its facts and tidbits, I'm able to relive the excitement when I played the games for the first time. Amazing piece of literature.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Why was this movie so Hot?  Two words:  Christina Ricci.  My boys Samuel L. Jackson and Justin Timberlake were on point in this movie.  Great storyline.  Loved the ending.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I Loved the music, the film and the man! The daughters were great too!  Good news for a change. Yeah
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Action packed, good storyline, great special effects, what more can I say?  I enjoyed it.  I've added it to my home library.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is way better than the first one! Very entertaining. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good fast paced game.
B00003CXFG|5.0|I love this movie.  Vin Diesel is on point.  Action packed.  I first saw this movie with a woman I later married.  She was my best friend and the love of my life....until she betrayed me 5 years later, but that's a different story in itself. I've added this movie to my home library.
098555780X|4.0|I give this a 4 star even though it is difficult for this totally green novice to follow. I have gotten hooked on a new hobby through the plethora of free video content JD has on YouTube and using book in unison with those videos really helps. I expect if I had a little more experience under my belt it would be easier to follow. Would be helpful to have some notation on level of difficulty. All said, there are some beautiful knots in here that I can't wait to learn.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|It was an action packed movie with a good storyline.  Loved the weapons and characters too.  A must see movie for Halo game fans.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This story about about a dog and his dedication to his master is<br />very touching.  I would recommend it to anyone not only pet owners.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Great storyline.  Pretty good special effects.  An escape from reality with a surprise twist at the end.  Must see movie for sci-fi fans.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I ordered this and it arrived in great time! It came as a special edition and I also received a digital copy which is awesome!!! Love this movie.
B0013D8LKO|5.0|Very sexy movie.  Thought provoking.  Great storyline.  I loved it.  Makes secret societies seem sexy in a dark kind of way.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I have this one in my CD player constantly and really love it although I miss Fade Into You and hope that will be released in a follow up CD
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of his music, finally got around to watching it. I can see anyone that enjoys music, whether a Marley fan or not, will really enjoy this. Love how they really broke down his life story and you get to follow this well put together timeline of his journey. For me, it trumped a lot of the negative rumors I had heard over the years about him, and the message he sent through his music is how he truly felt.<br /><br />It's rather long for a documentary, but there's never a moment of 'when is this thing going to end'. Watched it on a date night, the two of us have been listening to his music non-stop since!<br /><br />This is a must watch whether you have Amazon Prime or not!
1932100660|5.0|The information in this book, if used/applied, has the potential to save and prolong the lives of you and your loved ones.  I bought 30 of these books after reading it myself to hand out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story that makes you believe you can move beyond your current circumstances. Can't wait to see the movie!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Second book was not a disappointment....as awesome as the first. Well done....now to book three........must read you will not regret it
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|With one day remaining before the Oscars, Argo looks set to claim the award for Best Picture. The only reason there is any doubt is Ben Affleck's omission in the Best Director category.<br /><br />Is the acclaim deserved?<br /><br />Well, it's certainly a good film. The subject matter and the ultimate resolution will please many viewers. The acting is hard to fault at any point. But despite all those good qualities, Argo leaves me feeling a little underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because my expectations were so high?<br /><br />The film focuses on the struggle to free six American citizens from Iran, after the US embassy had been stormed in 1979. The six were given refuge inside the Canadian embassy, at great risk to all involved. That's the basis for an engaging story. The reason it falls a bit flat is due to the opening half. We see the hostages escape, but they are not a major part of the story. We are shown a few scenes where one hostage might console another, but there's not enough depth to see them as individuals. We want them to be rescued, because it is the right thing to do, but they could be six random people we happened to pass in a supermarket.<br /><br />Argo is more about the process involved in mounting a rescue attempt than about the hostages themselves, and that process is fascinating. CIA agent, Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), comes up with the idea of entering Iran posing as filmmakers scouting for a location. His preparation is thorough, and involves creating storyboards, hiring director Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), and John Chambers (John Goodman), who was to be responsible for makeup. The two set up a fake studio and actually go through the motions of filming scenes.<br /><br />I felt like I was back in 1979 due to the clothing, hairstyles, and generally muted color palette. But, unlike a movie such as Apollo 13 (where the outcome was also known), I was not gripped by the events on the screen for the duration of the film. I appreciate the effort, but I was only truly riveted during the second part of the story and the actual escape attempt itself. There is no need to reveal any more details, because it's better to see events unfold for yourself, even if you know the eventual outcome.<br /><br />I'm probably making Argo sound like a disappointing failure, and that's not the case at all. I just don't think it is the best film of 2012. It would probably creep into my Top 10, and I'm glad I own it, but I was not fully invested in the plight of the hostages until they were shown trying to escape. It's an important film in terms of subject matter, and I do appreciate the efforts made to free the six American citizens, but I won't be trying to persuade my friends that Argo is an unmissable thriller.only truly riveted during the second part of the story and the actual escape attempt itself.

B00BFUUMO8|3.0|this game every time u click on it . it keep redownloading again and again. hope they fixes it.. any help
B00A85EMVK|2.0|I was all excited about getting this movie because I really liked the orginal movie so getting it in 3D WOW!!  Notta for the most part of the movie it really didn't matter if you had on your 3D glass's or not.  In fact the best 3D parts I felt were in the credits of the movie I was really disapointed.  But this is mine and my wife's view.  Would I recommend it to someone else?  No!!
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I have to say, this movie was fantastic.  My wife and I both saw the original as young punks.  Now we're all growed up!  This flick did not disappointed.  WOW!  The set design, lighting, coolness factor were on another level.  Such aesthetic excellence, great sound, well done story; all created a wonderful movie experience which translated well to the small (big) 3D screen.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've read several novel and this one definitely touch my heart. I read it dozens of times and watch the movie dozen times as well. Just so damn good
B00701897I|5.0|So, so, good.  If you've missed this gem, get it and the whole family will love it.  Then read the \\"comic\\" books!!!  They're EVEN better!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|He loves this movie and was glad to get a copy of it. I am waiting for him to bring it over here for me to watch.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|A good thriller, maintains your interest all the way. Would recommend to those that like action and crime investigation novels.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|Great writing. The kids watch the DVD and read the book over and over. I myself enjoyed it.Helena Bonham Carter is great. We love all her books and DVD'S.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|Being a fan of Phantom of the Opera, I was a bit concerned about the sequel; however, I must say I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this and discovering that it wasn't that bad. The singing is amazing, the sets are truly fantastic, and the songs are quite good (not as good as Phantom of the Opera, of course). My favorite song (the song that starts out the play) is \\"Till I Hear You Sing\\" and it is a very emotionally powerful song. The only things I didn't really like (without giving too much away, though others probably have) would mostly be Meg's character and I do not like how they made Raoul an alcoholic and a couple other things (again, don't want to give anything away).<br />All in all, minus a couple minor flaws, this was a very good play.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I received this DVD in the mail promptly and in good condition. I gave this movie to my son for a gift and he loved it. Thank you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This may have been one of the best books I have ever read! It is difficult for me to get into books but when I do find one, I can't seem to put it down. This is one of them. It kept my interest from start to finish. The Hunger Games was very thrilling and keeps you on your toes.
B00009AOBI|5.0|I received this DVD in the mail promptly and in good condition. I gave this DVD to my sister for a gift and she loved it. Thank you.
B009O2XY12|5.0|The whole family gets a kick out of this game, We pl;ay it all the time until we just get tired of it.  The game was downdoaded from amazon & it only took a fer seconds to start playing.
B0098VXE50|5.0|I received this DVD in the mail promptly and in good condition. I gave this DVD to my son for a gift and he loved it. Thank you.
0743201140|2.0|I like to read the introduction of a book, it gives me an idea of where the author is headed. This introduction was not a strong intro to the book, therefore I did not finish reading. I did not care for the writing style because it did not capture my attention.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Adam Sandler is ALWAYS funny and this movie is no exception. Its a little slow getting started but once the characters are established the movie is great fun and the kids enjoyed it, the bigger ones as wel as the younger ones.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Love Colin Firth and the movie, so I wanted  to see it again.  I bought it to have a movie night with friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you dont mind reading a little porn the storyline is really fascinating and pulls you into their lives and true love.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I thought it was rather lengthy about the flowers and such.  But overall it was ok.  I was a little disspointed because everyone said it was so good.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really liked this story. It was written so believably it could have really happened! NASA could use it as a handbook.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I just wish that it didn't glorify the abuse of drugs and alcohol.  The main character in this book Charlie is a very interesting kid and even though I can't imagine a 15 or 16 year old boy talking or even thinking the way that he does I hope that when my son is his age he cares about people and is as inquisitive and intelligent as Charlie is. I did recommend this book to my 20 year old daughter and she loved it.  I would also recommend it for most young  adults but no one younger.  If you liked \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" you will probably appreciate this book like I did.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|Why release the syndicated version when the expanded versions are out on dvd? the conversion was poorly done except for the WB logo. Scenes are fuzzy and out of focus. So not worth the money i spent out of my christmas bonus! will not recomend and wish i could return this item. Already returned it one time when the dvd sleeves fell apart!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I thought both season 1 and season 2 of dowton abbey were great!  Would recommend them to anyone who likes British drama.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|Ive tried other USB extension cables and none worked without a power supply.. this cable works great without the need !
B000001ESN|5.0|great album beginning to end, classic rush,if you love rock n roll you should own this. as for the geek from new york who wrote what a horrible band rush is all i can say is get back to your village peoples greatest hits because you obviously arent a rocker! rush has stood the test of time for 40 years with no sign of letting up. all 3 musicians in this band are amazing and continue to tour and make people remember why theyre part of rock n roll history!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good story and lots of sex and passion. Not a believable story but it kept my attention and very hot and sexy!
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|The movie was awesome. Better than the first one. Much longer. Can't wait for a part three. Arrived in great condition and very quick.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|It was pretty good.. some parts seemed a little over done, like the jokes got old after a while. Maybe more for a younger crowd.
1592407889|3.0|she doesn't quite get that even now, at 55, she is who she is because of her mother, as Fonda is due to her dad. Odd there's so little of Shirley MacLaine in this book but i suppose from her perspective, that's the problem. She's eschewed any kind of conventional life like her mom and finally seems happy like her mom, she even paid for her wedding after all that so all's well that ends well. Not sure why there's all this focus on a loss (or not) of plane tickets from forty years ago, it didn't seem to even matter then, at least to her dad, or who she thought was her dad. She has her life in Connecticut, she is lucky.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|It wasn't awful, but I didn't really LOVE it. I don't think I'm going to watch it again after watching it for the first time.
B001OGRQAQ|5.0|33 years later, this album is still cutting edge, Fripp and Eno are here too. David Byrne successfully marries layered and complex African rhythms with synthesizer sounds and the results are amazing.Depending on how you listen to them, some songs are both hypnotic and relaxing or high energy fuel-but always fun.  A must for any Talking Heads fan.
B0001I561E|5.0|My favorite Disney movie! Quite possibly my favorite movie of all time :) Funny, interesting and very well done. I love it!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham can't miss.  An ending you don't see coming.  I was exhausted when I went to sleep, but couldn't put the book away
B007V65R54|5.0|I also got an audio and its great as well! This book gives very informative information on how to distinguish signal from noise in order to make a good judgement.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|There are three factors that separate Wunderlist away from the pack of other list apps:<br /><br />- Ease of use:  Adding lists, tasks, and sub tasks is very intuitive, and most importantly, FAST.  Entering items, and checking them off as completed takes a minimum of effort.  I can add multiple items before I forget them all<br /><br />- Integration with multiple devices:  I use wunderlist on my Kindle Fire, android phone, and Chrome browser at work.  The interface is consistent between them, and the syncing just works.<br /><br />- Sharing with others: I share lists with my wife, which is a great way for us to keep track of everything from grocery lists to home improvement projects.<br /><br />While it doesn't have the bells and whistles of something like Evernote, it is tops in the free and easy department.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a modern Romance.  I loved this book,  I loved the characters. I can't wait until the next<br />book come out in May (I think)  I'm looking forward to it.
B0086449YA|4.0|As with most of his recent work, you have to listen to this a few times to appreciate it. The title track is an exception.  It is clever and catchy.  As always, the band is superb as well.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It has been a very long time since I have read a book that can make me to never put it down! All the while I was torn in two directions of believing and not believing. In the middle it does get a little redundant, but then again that's her life, redundant. I really do recommend this book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Got to admire Denzel's acting in this one. By far one of my favorite movies with him in it. 2nd to &#34;The book of Eli&#34; of coarse :D
B000YDCFRE|4.0|These boots are without a doubt the best boots I have ever worn. They are comfortable and stylish. They are my second pair bought. The price is great considering they are $180 at timberland. When I originally bought my first pair they were $160 but have become instant classics since, thus hiking up the price. The only reason why I didn't give it five stars was because my first pair worn off very quickly from the soles (recycled) and the boot tongue stitch came off(same as pic) a few months after purchase and I had to get it stitch back. I reside in Chicago and they have been through storms and snow blizzards. I will repost a review for the second pair.
B004RZGUBM|4.0|I love Dickens. He is the inspiration for many authors who have a message within a story. As an author I realize the importance of his voice and how it teaches me. He is one of many authors I consider the best of their time. I love that it's all together in one collection.
0312330537|5.0|A complex semi-autobiographical novel of India.<br />Read it. You know it's complex when a study guide is available, which I did not use, BTW.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I wasn't too impressed and will more than likely not even use this free app.  I guess it plays ok, but being use to a different online puzzle game, it has me spoiled to not want to accept any other.
B00B10ENBA|5.0|I loved this movie as it was a true historical moment dealing with the American Embassy in Iran.<br />Ben Aflict was very convincing as an actor, therefore this is a must see!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Post apocalyptic Atlanta, Georgia is a gloomy place to start civilization.  Although I was never a huge fan of Zombie movies, this season delivers everything your classmates and coworkers keep talking about.  It's an excellent drama with plenty of action as this season continues to deliver on that premise.<br /><br />Rebuilding civilization requires people to be civilized and even the good guys have a hard time maintaining a code of conduct.  Children are forced to act like adults and the characters you've gotten to know get stronger.<br /><br />The sanctuaries introduced in season 2 become territory worth fighting over as leaders are challenged to stand up for what they believe in.<br /><br />Chances are if you've already watched Season 1 and Season 2, you're going to watch Season 3 no matter what these reviews say.  Without cable television, Amazon offers a way to watch these episodes one day after they've aired.  Not only do I recommend this show, but I recommend the Amazon Watch Instantly service for any show you need to keep up with if watching it live on Network television is not an option.
B002361MLA|5.0|Well worth the read and almost a cheat book to most spirituality books I've read in the past. I have gained a lot of knowledge from this book and can't wait to re read it and others.
B001GJ9G90|1.0|It wouldn't play past one minute! Kept buffering and stopping. Waste of a few dollars. Really wanted to watch this movie.. Smh.
0345803485|5.0|So love the story that I can't put the book down. :) I recommended it to a friend and she's also crazy in love with the (book) story.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this puzzle game. The way you can change the number makes it more challenging. I just wish there were more pix to choose from.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Well worth the few bucks. Have not had an issue with this app, ever. It's pretty intuitive, easy to change, enter information, does not lag, has the option for a huge amount of personalization, and updates quickly. Powerful, and it works every time - not sure what else anyone would want in a calendar app. Much thanks to the developers.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a senior and I thought this game would be real simple and boring but you definitely have to use strategy which makes it not boring.Has a good plot as well.
B004EFBC9U|5.0|There is nothing like the deadpan humor in Hot Shots! (and Part Deux, come to think of it). The witticisms, word play, and physical humor barely give you a moment to catch your breath from laughter.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I saw slender man behind me and I threw my kindle across the room it's that scary!!! Get this if you are a scary games lover. The first time I played it I loved it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's so beautifully written and wonderfully narrated, it was for me to put it down, after all AT one point I had to take care of my children. I highly recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the bestselling game in the universe!<br />I love the style of the game.<br />I recommend this game to all customers!
B0063IH60K|5.0|i enjoy this game. i play it when im bored and it makes time fly by. i definitely suggest game to anyone who likes a good thinking game to pass the time:)
B009C643OC|1.0|All you do is swim around in circles and get eaten by sharks. It is not worth the money and I wish I could get a refund.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I got a tablet for xmas and didn't know what books to download. I had already read all of the Fifty Shades of Grey books and loved Christian and Ana's story. I couldn't read Bared to You cause I felt like I was cheating... lol.<br />When I saw Hopeless on the Best Seller list I decided what the heck. OMG fell in love with Sky and Holder. I couldn't put it down. Collen is an amazing writer, feel so many emotions in her writing. When I finished Hopeless I had to see what else Collen wrote. I found Slammed and POR... Lake and Will... AMAZING! Can't wait for her next projects.
0307346617|5.0|World War Zombies? It is awesome, I can't believe the author can make this fantastic novel, now I can't wait to see this movie

0307895475|5.0|Huge book that covers everything a gamer would need to know in Skyrim.  Great detail and awesome color illustrations.  Couldn't play the game without it.  Get this book !
0525952926|5.0|Great follow up of the story! Holds your attention from beginning to end. Can't wait for the third of the series to come out.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works well and does exactly what it advertises.  Easy to use and really does clean up leftover and unneeded files.  Highly recommended !
1449410243|1.0|Adult humor that is inappropriate and basically not very good. A few bad, blue jokes that are stretched into a book.
B009AMANBA|5.0|A wonderful book that I purchased for my new Kindle that I purchased, but then lost, due to your propriatory rules, because even though this is the third kindle I have purchased, 2 are in my wife's name where many purchases were made, which I CAN'T ENJOY UNLESS I BORROW HERS.  The third kindle I had under my name, but I wasn't allowed to have my wife SHARE items she and I had acquired, before we purchased the third kindle. consequently I lost all my purchases I made on the third Kindle, because I switched Proprietorship of the third Kindle to my wife's name so I COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF WHAT HAS BEEN ACQUIRED UNDER THE FIRST TWO KINDLES I PURCHASED, WHICH ARE UNDER MY WIFE'S NAME ! ! !  I didn't want to purchase EVERYTHING ALL OVER AGAIN !
