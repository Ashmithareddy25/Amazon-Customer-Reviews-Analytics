B007VYQ6DS|5.0|Loved this video!  A must see for those who love our animal friends.  It is a good look into the lives and the loves of our chimpanzee family.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|this is my favorite move hands down. Such a great period piece using great actors. Keira Knightly is perfect for these types of roles
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Another GREAT video!  I so love the Avatar and cannot wait for the next one.  This movie, to me, should go down as a classic.  Right up there with Forest Gump, The Wizard of Oz, To Kill a Mockingbird, etc.  A MUST SEE!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Space saving and money saving. All the harry potter movies in one place, no searching around for each movie and what a great price for all 8 films!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|OMG!  It is Michael Jackson ... need I say anymore?  The best video, and would have been the best concert in the world.  Rest in Peace Michael Jackson -- you will always be missed and always be loved.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Very interesting book! Great read, now to read the sequence! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|Loved this video.  I am a whale lover, humpbacks being my favorite, and this movie made me cry, laugh and cheer.  A must see for those who love our animal friends.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|If you go on facebook on your computer you will love this app. Keep in touch with all of  your friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was an amazing book right from the very beginning. I was a little disappointed in the ending but still enjoyed the whole story.
B005ZUR724|1.0|don't buy game. I have contacted customer service and still waiting to hear back. if I buy a game it would be nice to play the game right away.  if this continues I wont spend another dime on gameloft again. if they resolve situation I'll change my review.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Having not read any of the Lee Child books, I watched this movie with fresh eyes. For those of you expecting something fun and over the top like Red or Knight and Day, this is not that kind of movie. That said, it is fun. This movie takes you on a journey with the characters trying to solve the mystery with more realistic action and scenarios than have been in most recent movies. It is more like an old-school cop movie like Bullitt or Dirty Harry. I really enjoyed this movie. My favorite part was the car chase. It was so refreshing to see a chase put together this way. The surround sound was amazing and put you right in the action. The movie had great acting, believable but awesome action scenes, and a well thought out plot. It also wasn't too predictable. I would say it was a good show all around. If you like movies that are awesome, watch this. Now, a note on content: This movie deserved the PG-13 rating it received. There was a little bit of swearing, including the token PG-13 \\"F-word.\\" Also, if any of you are nervous about that part in the preview where you see that scantily clad woman, that is literally all you see. The bulk of the rating was for the violence, which this movie has in abundance. You see some innocent people killed, also there's some awesome hand to hand fights. Some of the killing\deaths were disturbing for my wife. Great movie overall, I was pleasantly surprised.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was soooo good! it was chatching right from the beginning. I never wanted to put this book down!
1616550414|5.0|This book is amazing! Perfect for any Zelda fan. Love the concept art and the storyline section of it. You won't regret buying it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I could watch the blu-ray disk and stream on Amazon. The series us fantastic and this is a Great deal to boot.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this version of solitaire, the different levels of difficulty are very fun. This is one game I can play over and over
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I have seen a little of the original anime and thought they did a great job in transferring the original stories into a live action film.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I actually found this game a little hard to play. Maybe the size of the paths need to be bigger
B006O6F932|3.0|We purchased this as a gift for our grand daughter for Christmas.  She loves Monster High dolls, so we thought this would be perfect.  It has a lot of really small pieces (accessories) that can easily be sucked up in the vaccuum cleaner or lost.  Additionally, it is really not that easy to fold up and unfold so it stays out and in open state all of the time.  This is inconveinent as she is not always at our home.  It would be better if the accessories would fold up inside the &#34;school house.&#34;
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Not a light read but powerful. Inspiring story of survival and the power to exist through extreme and constant stress. The protaganist will stay with you for a long time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was surprised more often than not. Until the he last few  pages I didn't know who the man in her life would be.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|My husband and I remember the beginnings of the Beatles, the British invasion, and all that as well as the many shapes their music took in the all too few years they were together. That's why I bought this after watching it on netflix. This CD has footage and interviews from the whole span of that time up to the present. Really enjoyed the perspective of Paul and Ringo and Eric Clapton among others. George always seemed like a &#34;special' one to me - and this documentary explores how deeply his spiritual quest went which also helps to explain why the four could not possibly have stayed together.  It's a great documentary for 20th century music historians as well as people who just loved the Beatles - or don't remember them and want to know what the fuss was about.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I didn't order it in time for Christmas, but I watched it as soon as it arrived.  I enjoyed the back stories about the movie that were included with this version.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this book!  Not only did it champion two of my favorite cities and their unique qualities (SF,NYC), but it combined old world with new (A Bookstore, Google).<br />Sloan built up a fun group of characters that the reader embraces through a race to find answers to a bizarre hidden puzzle.<br />A joy to read from beginning to end.  I have gone out of my way to recommend this to many of my friends.<br />A gem of a novel.  I only wish that I could discover more books like this one that stretched my imagination and entertained my soul.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Killers in general, although I didn't care for their last album. This one has them back in the game.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love being able to stay in touch with those from my past... definitely a good program.  I am very satisfied.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|If you're an artist or want to be an artist or struggling to be artist (musician/writer/painter/etc.)...you gotta read this.  In addition to an honest reality check, it will challenge, motivate, and validate your journey.
B0086700CM|5.0|Me and my friends play it all the time when we have a break off of the show but its really cool.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! It's a love story that will blow you away all while exploring erotic fantasy. It's definitely a love story worth reading.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Solitaire is solitaire.  That review took three words but I can't submit it untill I  use a certain amount of words. This will be my LAST review
B00632HWOG|3.0|seems to be up to par with any other computer mail service. Started with Yahoo with my first computer and have stayed wit them
034580404X|5.0|the third book gets a little trying as it ties everything up, but I really enjoyed it and it did wonders for my marriage. a bit out of the norm so be prepared for kinky, if you turn up your nose to anything unusual, then don't bother, but if you like to read a bit about something daring and different, even if you wouldn't try it, then this is for you.
B00003CXXJ|1.0|I got this movie for my dad since its his favorite movie, but he said it won't play past half way through. It was guaranteed at over 90% but I don't even have 60% of the movie! I'm pretty bummed :(
0007447868|4.0|I have read elsewhere that A Feast for Crows is really only the first half of what would have been the fourth book in the series and that a Dance with Dragons is the last half. The story goes they would have been one volume, but it made for such a long book that the publisher asked it be cut in half. I have no idea if that is true, but it certainly reads that way. Several primary characters from the first three books make cameo appearances, and several others never make an appearance at all. Also, the end is much more abrupt than any of the other books. It really does feel like an arbitrary stop rather than a conventional ending. Missing some of my favorite characters initially was very bothersome, but Martin, as always, quickly drew my attention to the one he was telling instead of the one he was not. While I am looking forward to making their reacquaintance in the next book, I was really pretty happy with the many new characters introduced in A Feast for Crows. I guess what I'm saying is that Martin writes well enough that I am content to let him tell his story his way.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So realistic and fun i love it but i wish the energy would increase past 100. Also i understand why the special horses cost gems like the unicorns but the other ones should be coins.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|What a refreshing,wonderful film.Ewen McGregor is especially good in this role.General plot is that Emily Blunts charactor,Harriet Checkworth-Talbut represents a wealthy Arab who dreams of introducing Salmon to the Yemon.Ewen as Dr Fred Jones is the government Fisheries expert pushed into becoming involved in this project.Their journey is touching and funny
B006LSZECO|4.0|I love good mysteries and this one had some of the best plot twists I have encountered in awhile. As I am reading I like to make predictions...see. if I can figure things out early. This book had some nice (for the reader!) surprises.
B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I love the Downton Abbey series, however this set of dvds has some scenes cut from the PBS Masterpiece series. I was disappointed to see that I did not have the complete season 3 as shown on PBS.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is.... AWESOME it's addicting,fun and it's a wonderful game to use to pass the time.The characters are not like any other.The boards and jetpacks are well thought out.The game runs smoothly and never freezes.Subway surfers is colourful unlike temple run.It never gets boring.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down at all. Basically addicted to it!!!!<br />The way Suzanne Collins wrote this book was amazing! I could almost feel the pain that katniss was going through!!!<br />My friends recommended it to me plus all of the rave reviews I decided to give it a try... I'm so glad I did!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome! I love how each month there is another theme! It's better than temple run! I'm so addicted to it but i think there should be a number two for subway surfer.
1582701709|2.0|the best i can say so far about this book that it is very prettitly packaged, each page says the same thing, it could all be wrapped up in two paragraphs
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book was truly amazing. The second installment of the mortal Instruments series is better than the first. There was many nail biting moments, and this was a rollercoaster of action and thrills. Clary and Jace find out that they are not what they think they are. Simon changes WHAT he is. Lastly Valentine is back and more evil than ever. If you read City Of Bones you will fall in LOVE with City Of Ashes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Writer's divers ideas are incredible, the end time scenario is different  I loved it and I am teddy to read the next one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is sooooo cool  it is a step up from the original but its just a bit more confusing (which is awesome)
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|It was a great read. Spooky, fun, and mysterious. I loved the vintage photos and how the author integrated them into the story. I highly recommend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. I love this game so much. Even my little brother plays it a lot on my kindle..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am a die hard Jackie Collins fan...I only read her stuff, but this book was amazing!!  I loved it.  Of course there is all of the hype surrounding the book, but it is really a great book.  Not a dull moment in the storyline.  Hard to put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The ups and downs of Downton Abbey continues.  Just when you think, wow, everyone's going to be happy for at least a little while, bam, they smack you down again.  It keeps you laughing and crying in the same episode (well, maybe not both in Episode 5!) and is just beautifully written and acted.
034580404X|5.0|Read each of the books as they were released and so very happy to have the collection of them in one place for easy keeping.
B004UBUNDE|3.0|The story line is fine building up to the Hubble but not enough photos from the Hubble of fantastic space beauty!
B0036MDNN0|5.0|The item is very detailed and I recommend it to everyone who is interested in prehistory. It is great to make a collection.
B004AP9W46|1.0|To be fair, I didn't read this entire book, less than half way through I had had enough.  This is apparently Anne Rice's take on what Heaven and Hell is,and that's her right, but I thought I was reading a book about vampires.  Unless you're looking for a debate on God and the devil, skip it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game for my three years old son but when getting this game I thought he might not like bit it open an whole new world. Motive skills are improving greatly and is super fun for car rides<br /> Just love it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book seemed dull in the beginning but as I read on I started to realize I couldn't stop . A delightful page turner I'd say
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Amazing! I love the quality  and simplicity. It was so easy to download and I love how easy it is to use.
B006QS0PF0|3.0|In her interview with ChicagoPride.com, Portia said this about writing her book:<br /><br />\\"I was a little hesitant simply because the idea of a memoir for me at 37 seemed very overblown, and it didn't fit my life. I thought, how could I possibly make an eating disorder compelling and interesting when all I did was cook food and eat, or not eat, and then go on my treadmill? I thought that was the most boring book that I could possibly ever write [laughs]. I didn't talk to anyone, I didn't go anywhere, and I thought that a memoir had to be full of interesting things that happened to the person.\\"<br /><br />Turns out she was right on.  There's really no there, there.  I always want to believe that there is something more to celebrities than their image.  Seems like I always realize that there's actually a lot less.  If you enjoyed Portia in one of her shows, just take that for what it's worth.  Reading her book is a disappointment, and the time it takes to read it is not worth diluting any admiration you might have.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was very well done and I enjoyed the challenges. There were a few glitches and I had to close it down a few times.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|This is my era!  I remember so much about this wonderfully portrayed show!<br />We &#34;ladies&#34; dressed just like they do and we (the gals that I knew) were as fanatically neat and tidy and clean.<br />i was not in business at that time...but business is business and doesn't change with the year.<br />There will always be backbiting and skullduggery and betrayal in any decade of business.<br />Were morals that lax?  Do humans really change that much?<br />It is so refreshing to see a show that is not focused on murder, mayhem, mindless banter or &#34;real life&#34; idiocy.
B0076DELIG|2.0|After reading all of Connelly's books to date, I was excited to download \\"The Black Box\\"  I read the book from cover to cover, but it certainly wasn't anywhere near a page turner for me.  For those of you that want to read the book, I don't want to give it away, but let's just say the flow seemed to be a struggle for Connelly on this one.  There was a lot of chapters that seemed to me like fill.  The person that showed up to enable his escape from the barn at the end was hardly believable and Connelly went on to write that the person didn't wish to tell why she was there.  Well, the simple truth is that there was no reason that would make any sense.  The incident with the helicopter crash was also a bit of a stretch.  There were other incidences that required more imagination than one needs for most reads.  Having said all that I see that I am in the minority on this one judging by the stars that it has received.  So be it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|One of the only apps that allows you to have a community with dragons. I appreciate that the dragons don't die and that my friends can send me valuable gold!

B0063GORYU|5.0|Love the game.  Nothing else to say. If someone has nothing else to say  don't keep telling them they so many words left to say.  No more reviews will be done my me because I don't  have a whole lot  to say about things.  I either like or dislike.  Period!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B008QE9VJI|4.0|Boy, Christmas can't come quick enough around our household. I am a devoted fan . Shipping was fabulous. I'm wondering how Tim Burton perceived the Collins family.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This book was very entertaining and a great read. Not sure how factually correct all the details are but Mr. King purports to have done a lot of research regarding the Kennedy assassination. My wife wants to read this but her caveat is that she does not like scary books- looking back on all of the Stephen King books I've read (I've read them all save for &#34;Under the Dome&#34;), this one does have some scary elements in it but definitely rates a 2 on my Stephen King horror scale. It was a quick, entertaining read.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|Cherlize Theron is brilliant as a villain in this epic-wanna-be movie twist on the Snow White story.  Chris Hemsworth (Thor) also holds his own, but K. Stew's bad acting made the movie less enjoyable.  I'm sure all of the Twilight fans may reject my review as result of my view, but she just did not fit the role well besides her attractiveness.  The action and special effects were good.  The storyline was interesting but a bit prolonged and boring at parts.  However, I'd definitely recommend renting Huntsman for its entertainment value and to see Cherlize, but don't expect a Lord of the Rings epic feel.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|this app i recomend for people who need relaxing noises and sounds. these sounds will put you to sleep in no time. the flaw is that there needs to be more sounds that come with it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The Marvel film makers have done a great job with the precursors to the Avengers movie.  Iron Man and Thor were especially entertaining so I had pretty high expectation for this movie.  The Avengers exceeded my expectation and surprisingly was better than the Dark Knight Rises.  The cast is superb, the action is non-stop, there are plenty of laughs, the plot is solid, and it portrays the essence of the comics very well.  It was so good that I did not hesitate to pre-order the movie once it became available.  I can't wait for the upcoming sequels of Thor 2 and Iron Man 3 as well as the possible Hulk remake (although I liked the Edward Norton remake).  Hopefully, the Avengers 2 will meet my thru-the-roof expectations when it release in a couple years.  I can't recall a better movie in 2012 than the Avengers.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|when i got the app it let me play it for a couple times then wouldnt let me play. it would turn on the send me back home.  they need to fix that.

B00APJLFEG|4.0|My family enjoyed this movie as a whole and that doesn't happen often. I have a teenager and one still in elementary school so finding something that isn't painful for the teenager and not over the top for my 8year old can be a challenge. I took away a star because of some lack of respect shown to adults. I know it's suppose to be fun but I'm a parent and though it was funny when I was kid now that I'm on the other side of the joke I don't like it. (sticks out tongue)<br />I rented this from the \\"THE LARGE BRIGHTLY COLORED BOX\\"{ ;)hint hint} because it was cheaper.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|i bought this for my 13 year old son who can sometimes be careless amd drop his phone it worked out good didt fit quite right for the galaxy s2 from at&t but work good other then that
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Prometheus. It was a sci fi adventure for sure. I thought it was a little too creepy and not a very good plot line
B001L63JC8|5.0|The talent of the Gabriel-era Genesis is nothing short of phenomenal.  Scintillating sounds, melodies and provoking lyrics combine with a dark and introspective theme to produce a truly unique album.  Though a far throw from today's pop culture, it is a must of any progressive-rock loving fan.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Dark Sahdows. I am a fan of Johnny Depp and this was a poor example of his work. I thought it was unncessisarily gory.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! Its like temple run but instead of tilting your device u slide your finger across the screen to move. The only thing annoying about this game are all the pop ups. I especially love the world tour theme!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The Dark Knight rises. It was a little confusing and the story line was lame this time. The same good actors however
B000IJ79UW|5.0|I have wanted this four disc collection of &#34;Superman:The Movie&#34; for a long time now and it finally came down to a price which I couldn't pass up. The film, of course, is a classic in every way and NO actor will ever play Superman/Clark Kent as well as Christopher Reeve did! The REAL treasure of this set are the documentaries, both some new and some original from 1978 about the making of the film. Also included are some original 1940's Superman animated shorts by Max Fleischer, the same guy who did the &#34;Popeye&#34; animated shorts as well as a Superman film starring George Reeves as Superman. These are really fun to watch for any true Superman fan! If I have a complaint about this set it is that it doesn't have a documentary about the MUSIC of Superman:The Movie by John Williams, arguably one of the best and most beloved of all Film Scores! I think that this oversight is unfortunate. The music that William's composed for the film became a PART of the Superman character and is now hard to imagine Superman WITHOUT John Williams' theme for him! Beyond that, this set is great and is a MUST HAVE addition to any real fan of the original Superman:The Movie film. Full stars!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good story line.  Looking forward to part-2 of Season 3 in Feb.  I finally understand why someone may want to own an AR-15.

B006XOBFB0|5.0|This set of discs has been in my collection ever since they were originally issued and have established themselves as my performances of choice even in the light of other fine recordings by Uchida, Imogen Cooper and several other fine pianists.<br /><br />They have always seemed to me to offer perfectly attuned readings in terms of period, balance between piano and orchestra, pacing, dynamics and numerous other similar details. There is not one performance that disappoints as far as performances is concerned.<br /><br />However, the recordings were made some time ago and they did not all offer the same level of recorded excellence with some discs being clearly somewhat thin on string tone. Generally I do not buy re-mastered discs on the basis of sheer cost in terms of a complete collection but I have nevertheless bought a number of re-mastered discs from Sony and they have all been worth the investment.<br /><br />In this case, the coupling of masterful performances, some thin-toned original discs and the remarkably low price being asked for these wonderful performances was a temptation I could not resist. I am delighted to report that in every case the re-mastering has been a total success with much improved tonal range throughout and a marked improvement in the string tone in the worst original cases. The set now has a unity of recorded sound that was not true of the original discs.<br /><br />This is a case of the very best becoming even better as a result of advances in re-mastering and at a remarkably low price. The sleeve notes, which were never very impressive, have now disappeared altogether but I personally have solved this minor issue by keeping the original sleeves inside the new, fairly spacious box. Information about these concertos is readily available on the web for those who wish to know more. What we have here is a concentration purely on the recordings and they are outstandingly successful.<br /><br />I would suggest that, given the excellence of the performances and recordings of these concertos and especially at the current asking price, this set warrants the most serious consideration from future purchasers either as an 'only' purchase or as part of a bigger collection of multiple versions.concertos and especially at the current asking price, this set warrants the most serious consideration from future purchasers either as an 'only' purchase or as part of a bigger collection of multiple versions.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Nice app, I give a 5 rating for being free and working as well as it does!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a simple alarm clock with a little polish.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much! It is the best game ever! My dad and I play it all the time! I like how it switches from city to city! You should definitely get this app!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is an excellent game but when ever I try to use a save me the game freezes and crashes.please fix this.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Absolutely one of the most well-crafted crime shows ever to hit the small screen. Intricate, gritty, thought provoking this is one series you will watch over and over again.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Not only my kids love this game but my husband is crazy for it too! Easy to learn how to play. Great Yeti to ride down the slopes. Scenery is nice too.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The mechanics of the game can be a bit choppy at times, especially while turning corners. I hope this will be adressed as the game developes. Temple Run 2 is a great evolution from the previous game with updated stuff and the zippy jumping rope thing; yes, the mine shaft car contraption adds some silly stress . yes 3 out of five!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I won't lie, there were parts of this book I found rather dull. Mostly in the beginning. Then the more I read, I started to realize how essential the mundane in the beginning of the book was. The character development and key plot points take a while to develop, but like any house built, once the foundation is laid, the rest of the building is up to the imagination. Mr. Martin has done a wonderful job, in my mind, creating such interesting characters in a world so full of intrigue and adventure. Whether you love them or hate them, following the many different character story lines that all affect one another is truly a fascinating read. I can't recommend this book enough to the lovers of the genre and can't wait to see what's in store for me in the future! J. R. R. Tolkien may be the prized author of Europe, but here in America, I lay down my kindle for one man. George R. R. Martin, the Author of the West!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very fun and entertaining. especially for horse lovers I enjoyed it a lot. download this app its coolnexcept for the ads that keep popping up those aren't fun.....
0151003084|5.0|I've known about Edward Gorey's artwork since I saw the wonderful 1978 Broadway production of Dracula, for which he designed the sets. This collection of twisted drawings and descriptions elicits gasps and laughs, simultaneously. I only wish there were other items for sale with these designs, such as tshirts and sweatshirts. I would snap up a few of those, without hesitation.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's a fun and addicting game. thought it was a good game for my younger kids but it proved to be  too difficult. however, i am sure enjoying it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I need to find more games like this! Well worth the moolah :) Just try the free version and you'll probably get sucked into like me.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|The price was right, UI simple, play was engaging. I wish you could task your lazy pirates. In all i have enjoyed the game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you love solitaire, you'll love this app. Don't worry about the adverts, they're not even a bother. Have fun.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|what a series, though I felt it lacked some of the tightness of narrative of the first two seasons I still loved it
B0026NWBY2|5.0|Number 1 best musical purchase I ever made: Abbey Road. Best damn album ever made. As you can tell I love the Beatles. It took George a while to break out of his shell, but once he did, he was the best songwriter, and obviously was the best musician. His voice wasn't great though, but was good enough.<br /><br />This was my first George Harrison CD. 19 songs for $10? Good deal. The problem I had with this is that once I heard these 19 songs (3 of which were live recordings at the Concert For Bangladesh)I needed more. My craving for the music was still there. This CD is just not enough. Each song is just incredible. Although I could have done without the live recordings. Yes the songs sound a bit dated. The ones from the '70s sound, well, like the '70s. And the '80 sound like the '80s. But the big difference here is that these aren't just like those pop songs whose popularity fizzled out. Despite the old sound, the sound is great and it stands the test of time. Expect to hear some really beautiful slide guitar and some of the Harrison-y sounding solos. He covers a Bob Dylan song here, and while I cannot stand listening to Bob Dylan, I do greatly appreciate his songwriting talent. And his song on the CD is just astoundingly beautiful.<br /><br />If you are like me and are a huge fan, skip over this one. If you buy this, you'll probably do like me and fork over even more money to buy most of his other CDs anyway.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|We all need to have a place to get answers to some of our questions, Google is one place to find almost every answer.
0385344228|5.0|Whether you are a father, a mother or a son, this is a riveting book that makes us search our soles.
B005K2YTG4|5.0|This case is nice and slim. Easy to pack away in my purse.<br />Should protect my Kindle when out and about.
B001P9KR94|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it's really hard to explain why I like it. Verious plot holes for this movie have been explained to me and I have to agree with a good amount of them or respect that point of view. So here's what I enjoyed about it. The movie is pretty good at giving a sense you are in India, in that parts of the movie feel as if this is indeed a less developed country, and as the movie progress you see skyscrapers and some western elements. I feel India is justly represented in that way.<br /><br />The characters are pretty nice as I get reactions from the acting. I feel like laughing in the right spots, I feel terrified or hurt correctly and get very powerful moments in many spots be it good or bad moments. The way the flashbacks explain both Jamal's life and the answer to MOST OF THE QUESTIONS, was pretty well done, it was an engaging story and pretty interesting to see how someone of low (sorry) education learns interesting trvia.<br /><br />How the movie played out, mostly was interesting and pleasant to view(minus the issues discussed below) and I felt it was a good two hours. It was a movie that made me feel good, reminds me of the older movies where everyone works out in a good way and you have a love story that, although doesn't have much behind it, you know will work and you enjoy.<br /><br />Now problems with the movie... I have been pointed out many legit problems and remembering the movie I have to agree with some. First it is possible to argue most of the plot is contrived and most stuff happens only because it needs to (though I THINK you can say that for most fiction book/movie/tv). Some flashbacks don't provide the answer to the questions, and some questions are edited out. The studio side's opinion is not shown well and Jamal gets brought back without any real conclusion reached (unless the host or producers just decided to believe him without seeing him talk to them). Also I've heard the argument that maybe Jamal shouldn't have won as since Latika is free, their love would've been enough for them. Some ways I think it would've been better others I don't.<br /><br />So I still like the movie, but regonize problems with it and wish bitts could be added to solve them. And as the beginning stated, the reasons I like it, only work for me and can just as easily have not worked for haters of this film. But I'm getting this in my collection no doubt.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I am not a huge fan of alien movies, so I went into this a skeptic. All in all it's not a bad movie, if you like action flicks. There's even a little bit of unexpected humor sprinkled in for good measure.
0920668372|5.0|This book is a classic for mothers everywhere! I cry nearly every time I read it! A must have for all households!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I was so excited to see this in theatres. I think the movie paid homage to the book without seeming redundant, it was good to see some of those famous scenes come to life.
0783225857|5.0|what can you say about a classic like this. either you like it or you don't but is it well done
0375703764|5.0|Admittedly, I had a difficult time at first understanding the concept of this book and keeping the story straight. But after a while I got sucked in and it was over much sooner than I wanted it to be. I laughed, I cried, I love it.
B000055Y0X|4.0|Not everyone will appreciate the humor but classic performances by great stars. Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens. entertaining
B006PE6VW6|5.0|Fans of Chris Evans need to see this movie.<br />It's cute in that typical romantic comedy fashion, but Anna's quirks add the extra oomph to make it a good see
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book fun book to read. I reccomend everyone to get this book I f u like funny romantic type books.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|In my opinion this is by far the best superhero movie of all time. The box office numbers didn't lie--i'll watch this over and over again.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I personally hated this book. I thought it was weird, written badly and too repetitive. I didn't like the style of writing either; the whole book is just letter after letter describing this poor kids life, thoughts and experiences. The subjects made me uncomfortable making me almost find this book trashy rather than enjoyable at all. This is just my personal opinion and if you feel the same way about repetition, reading letters someone wrote (writing style), and awkward sexual experiences, don't waste your money. I don't see how this book is popular at all.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I just Liam Neeson. Lots of action, without being gratuitous, good storyline. I will definitely watch it over and over.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Much better than the first book.  Waiting for the movie to come out and see who they cast.  It is a love story and life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great read. I saw the movie before reading the book. Now I want to seethe movie again. Looking forward to the next book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing and I rate it great graphic s but some times a bit sluggish overall a  great game
B003TQKVGU|4.0|I have read this several times. Very powerful and opens you up to a whole new way of looking at the world
B007VUA7VO|2.0|There are other battery monitors that give very detailed information on the battery useage of each app you have installed. This one did no more than the battery status indicator found in the &#34;devise&#34; settings of my Kindle Fire, other than the fact that it kept giving me unnecessary and annoying system notifications. It was free to try, so I unintsalled it.
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I liked this movie.  It was funny.  I thought it was gonna be funnier, but I wasn't disappointed.  I saw too many of the funny scenes in the previews.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I'm still new to the tablet & smart phone phenom. I grabbed this as a frebie to try out. It has all necessary tweaks, bells, and whistles Icould think of. It has many sounds, some of which I wondered if people really relax to, but most are very relaxing. I would recommend this to anyone who is in to relaxing to sounds other than music.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game!  it is very addicting and fun to challenge yourself.  it is a game you will keep coming back to.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|The most satisfying game app I ever bought. It keeps it interesting with new rules (just small stuff like &quot;this turn if you put a 0 down everyone will switch hands etc.) And it's only quite on me once as opposed to other apps I have the do it multiple times within one hour. I've been playing this for 3. My only down Sadie with this is that it doesn't allow you to hang onto a card for later play instead of drawing a new card. So if I have a wild and want to keep it but I have no matching color or number to play the game forces me to play the wild. It doesn't give me the choice to draw at that point. Still it makes it more challenging to come up with new clever ways to win.
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|A very entertaining movie.  The old man in it is great!  Lots of fun and  laughs.  A real rip-roaring ending!!!!  You've got to see this!!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Think of a psychedelic, hispanic singer who channels Dylan, Jim Croce and James Taylor in a completely incredible way and you have an inkling of Rodriguez. He created this stunning music in Detroit in the late 60's and went undiscovered in America. He adds another chapter to Detroit's rich musical history of people like Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Smoky Robinson, Aretha Franklin, Eminem, Jack White, Anita Baker and Kid Rock to name just a few. It's sad that he had to wait all these years for recognition, but we get to experience an undiscovered gem from the 1960's which makes it an even cooler story. In my opinion, there is not one bad track on Cold Fact or Coming from Reality. This is music with wisdom, confidently told in a very engaging style.
0061765236|4.0|I couldn't wait to finish, although it left me with lots of questions.  Seems like it could have been longer
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the new John Rebus novel. It still had the gritty edge that I have always loved about this character, along with the fascinating Edinburgh setting and supporting cast. I hope Mr. Rankin has decided to continue this series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If I was in a book club, I would push for this to be the next read! I got this book on recommendation from a friend without knowing the plot ahead of time and ended up loving it! The 2 main characters are especially written to provoke strong reactions from the reader, and the plot twists - conniving! I don't want to write anything to give away any clues, so I'll just say it was a great thriller that I had trouble putting down when I should have been sleeping or getting ready for the day. I'm going to pick up another of her books next!
B009EP3DJM|4.0|Good album, I enjoyed it, but unlike Animal , I got bored in just a few weeks, I feel the song selection is great, but is missing something...
B00280LYIM|5.0|I began reading this series because my eleven year old son loved it.  He didn't just love to read until he found this series.  So, I wanted to know why he liked the books so much.  I found that the books are funny, original, and they also help me to remember the Greek myths better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it is the best game ever way better than temple run I just just love it!!!!!!!!!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|This movies was great I don't know why it didn't do well in the theater. I wish they would do a real steel 2. The robots were great, and no blood and gore. I love Hugh Jackman and the little kid was funny and a pretty good actor.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such lifelike graphics and so fun to play on my aneroid device.Even though the really cool gear cost real money... you don't need that to have fun on this game. But sending the guys who made it a buck or two would be nice; right?
B00260GLBO|5.0|Nothing beats a Bruder for authenticity.  My 4 year old grandson has a fleet of Bruders and enjoys every single one!
0307730697|5.0|It never ceases to amaze me how fortunate we are as a country to have such patriotic young men & women who volunteer to do the dirty work of keeping all of us safe.  There will always be evil in this world and the young man depicted in this true story is the regular guy who step up to the plate and take on tremendous challenges without any reservations.  Hopefully, those who question the need for these heroes will come to understand just how truly human these men are while carrying out their duties.  We would be a lot less safe without their service.  BZ to the author & those who served w/ Adam Brown!<br /><br />dwc
B009MFKO3M|4.0|I fell hard and fast in love with the first record by our dear friends in Tame Impala. Catching a (surprise) live performance in Denver, Colorado a few years back while visiting family, I ran into Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips who was there just like me, an enthusiastic fan of the tones, colors, and sounds of the boys that comprise this radical vehicle. This album is a whole new exploration of pysch-shapes, guitar lines, confident bass romps, and fingertips dancing upon the black and white keys.<br />Where there is clean and polished sound, there is distorted and highly effected tones that paint quite a wonderful picture.<br /><br />&#34;Feels Like We Only Go Backwards&#34; is the best song that was never written in the 60's and lends itself to a modern punctuation that only 2012 could boast in.<br /><br />This is a fun trip. Roll down the windows and let the wind blow in.<br /><br />A+
0765325950|5.0|Great ending<br />Read it in 2 days just because i couldn't put it down!  Now what am i supposed to do!?
B00APJLEGA|5.0|I love Adam Sandler and he does not disappoint in this movie.  This is a funny, clever wonderfully animated film.  My only criticism is that the story line was a little old, a child raised by the father who tries too hard to protect her from the outside world and she rebels (think Finding Nemo).  The comedy aspects of the movie, especially the naive ways of &#34;Johnnystein&#34; make up for the overall plot.<br />Another issue, connectivity to Amazon's streaming video...still working on that.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love bingo I'm hooked great way to waste time or play a game you love to play also has slots AWESOME app
030758836X|5.0|At first I couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about regarding this book, but the more I read the better it got.  Excellent read.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just love this show.  It is so nice to see a show without violence. I am totally addicted! Oh the way those people lived!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! I can not find the words to describe how wrapped up I became in Collen Hoover's book Hopeless. It was a page turner to say the least. A breathless, touching, thrilling ride. So many twists and turns along the road with this story. Each page I turned I felt as though I was right there with the characters and living each moment with them. I love how connected I felt to Sky. She was a perfect heroine. She was strong, full of heart, and defied all odds. My heart was hurting for little Hope. This book brought out countless emotions! The young and innocent love between Holder and Sky was unbelievable! When the true meaning of Hopeless was told it had such an unexpected but beautiful meaning! I am looking forward to reading Collen Hoover's Slammed and Point of Retreat!
B009VB97EY|4.0|I liked the movie although I thought at times it was a little silly. I bought the movie because I heard about the dancing<br />The male dancing was just great and their bodies were outstanding. Had an all friends party to watch the movie enjoyed by all..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice fun game to pass the time. Great to pass time before classes in college. I like the graphics and cartoony style animation
B005KELW26|4.0|cannot state alot about this as it was purchased as a gift for my sister and I have not yet talked to her about it. But she didn't call with any complaints so must be ok
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My Granddaughter loves to build house and is always in look for more window and doors.  So I got these for her<br />birthday Feb 12.  She will be very happy.  Thank you for getting them to me on time.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie is just all around funny!  The minions remind me of my toddler.  I love it and all my kids love it ranging from 19 years old, 13 years old and 20 months old.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have three kindles and all I need is one cable unlike apple who is constantly changing and you can not use the same cable on all of their devices.
B00B7G23KQ|5.0|I really like this series. Been a fan from the beginning. I must say this is probably the best one yet. I really liked this movie and thought it was very scary.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so much fun, way more fun then temple run! I have to say this is my all time favorite, i love how if you reach a certion level the whole background changes and it gets so much harder.
B009YQJ322|5.0|I loved this movie. Thought it would be awful but man was I wrong. It's so entertaining. Dredd is a much better version of the story. Judge Dredd was awful but this is tons of fun. See it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This was definitely nice in the graphics region, but I don't like the way it curves while you are running. There are also less characters to choose from as well-but it's definitely worth the download.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I saw this in theaters with my niece and my mom. I must say this movie is my favorite cartoon ever. So many great comedians working together. Hey this is Adam Sandler.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is great! If you love mysteries and excitement this is the game for you..great graphics on my kindle fire HD totally worth the $2.99...kept me intrigued for hours..puzzles, hidden objects, and a lot more..
B001KZG99A|5.0|Robert Downey Jr is becoming a great actor. His performance as Tony Stark is great. Love the sarcasm he brings to the role. Looking forward to seeing the third movie. Only weakness is Terrance Howard. Don Cheadle was much better as Rhodes. Jeff Bridges was a bit corny but he was a fun villain. In the end Iron Man is one hell of a fun movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting and its a fun game to play in the car when your are in the car.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie. It's so funny and very quotable. Acascuseme. Anna Kendrick is beautiful and Rebel Wilson is perfect as Fat Amy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing.It's a lot like temple run but a lot easier.It's for all ages and it keeps your attention.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Saw the premier last night-- it's amazing. A must see for music fans, but its a strong story that can appeal to anyone and everyone. Bravo!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Toss away your old temple run. Temple run 2 is way more addicting and fun. The graphics are superb and it the game is challenging.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|He is so inspiring and such an amazing person. I definitely recommend this book to all beliebers :) love u Justin
B00992CF6W|5.0|V I've been over the first place for a WAFFLE and blogs with in language from your business to date of a WAFFLELPS NIGHT
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is absolutly awsome and fun i love it ! Now what are you waiting for? GO PLAY AND HAVE FUN(:
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I held off on buying the Star Wars version of Angry Birds, as much as I love both franchises. Perhaps I was feeling a bit burnt out. But when I finally did give in, I was quite glad that I did.<br /><br />Sure, the game has all the cutesy things you'd expect. Little wookies flying across the sky. Little Darth Vader piggies to tackle. But there's a wealth of complexity in here as well, and the puzzles can be devious!<br /><br />Take this early puzzle style. You are in outer space, and each planet has a gravity within its atmosphere. So you have to slingshot around one, catch the second planet's gravity, and slingshot to your destination targets.<br /><br />Then, later on, you start to run into those who can use the dark side of the force. The glowing red items are suspended in the air until you take out Darth Vader, at which point they all collapse to the ground.<br /><br />There's all sorts of cool challenges like this to figure out. Yes, certainly I enjoyed that Han Solo can blast away with his laser pistol in a directional manner, and that Luke Skywalker spins his light saber to take on enemies. But it always comes down to gameplay. The Angry Birds people have definitely kept up their talents in level design.<br /><br />I've played the Angry Bird games on my smartphone and PC, and I vastly prefer playing it on my Kindle Fire. The larger screen makes it much easier to line up the shot and to see the whole situation in one fell swoop. It's also quite impressive that for under three dollars you get a game which compares well to full price puzzle games on many other platforms.<br /><br />I've seen some people complaining online that they didn't get \\"enough\\" for their three dollars. Heck, you can buy a cup of coffee that costs three dollars! Just how cheap do people want their games to be?<br /><br />Well recommended, and well worth the money.<br /><br />I purchased this game with my own funds in order to do this review.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is even better than the first.  It has different obstacles and courses and leads you where ever now it has cliffs, water falls and a lot more! If u are truly temple run fan, you have to get it or u r crazy, and dumb just kidding but I'm not kidding when I say this, best game yet better than angry birds!
B00A81NFAS|1.0|Although I could relate only to the part of having to be treated for a mental illness (in my case depression) with medication, I found the story line depressing. Guy has a girl, loses her...finds someone new and gets to choose between the 2 of them. Pretty implausible to relate to if you've never had a relationship before. I could have related if he had dumped the girl at the end or she had dumped him and walked away. That would be believable and an ending I could deal with.
0486278077|4.0|Growing up with Oscar,I had read this as a youth and seen the film, but obviously the original book was much better. The concept is fascinating as a man's cruelty shows only in the face of the painting, while he retains his youth. This version is shorter than the original, but still maintains the grist of the story. A quick, but enjoyable read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As usual fantastic and a great follow up. Picks up where the first left off with more exciting stories. Gets you right back into it even if you read the first one a while ago.
B0095R6OBS|3.0|I got this because I was curious about Tim Burton's &#34;original&#34; Frankenweenie.  It's cute, and I'm sure I would have liked it much more had I seen it when it originally came out.  From a historical perspective, it's interesting.  And I always enjoy seeing Shelley Duvall act.  But the new animated version is much better.
B007SGM084|5.0|Actually the story itself is really good. The steaminess gets a bit old by the 3rd book but Ana and Christian are worth reading about. Warning very graphic!
B007BFSYMS|1.0|Alarm does not sound at set time.  I have set several alarms on my Droid Razr and none of them have sounded at the assigned time.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Hesitated to rent this moving but was much better than I expected.  Lots of action and drama.  My wife and I both gave it 5 stars.
1451695195|5.0|This was a good and fast read was hoping for alittle more info about his travel to the otherside! I hope when i go that God is waiting for me at the gate!
B008XX6J4C|2.0|I heard the Piano Guys on TV and thought they were great but was not impressed with this CD.  Everyone has their own taste but this one didn't work for me.  Was bumming as I bought it for an 18 hour car ride and after hearing it once have not played it again nor do I plan to.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|I have no idea why this album has had such low sales. It's a perfect pop album that can appeal to anyone whether they're five or fifty. It really does deserve to be successful.  When Kesha first came on the scene, I thought her stuff was fun and always turned it up on the radio. But I definitely didn't take her seriously. I don't know how it happened but I somehow came across her unreleased music and was blown away. She's been recording songs since she was 15 and had two hundred songs recorded before she even got a contract. She even appeared on the soundtrack of a Barbie movie three years before Tik Tok came out (the song is called Invisible). Her unreleased work proved that she could sing beautifully without vocal effects and that she could handle multiple genres of music. She also writes or co-writes her own songs (she's the daughter of country music songwriter Pebe Sebert).  Warrior takes Kesha back to her roots musically in the sense that it's a mix of genres. It's got the dance pop she's known for but it also has country, rock and folk songs. Yet it still feels cohesive. If you want to preview the album on Youtube, I recommend the following:  Last Goodbye - this song has an indie pop sound with banjo and mandolin accompaniments Past Lives - a folk style ballad produced by The Flaming Lips and featuring Wayne Coyne. Ben Folds arranged the strings Wonderland - a simple country-esque ballad about the friendships she left behind when she became famous Love Into the Light - an ethereal ballad based on In the Air Tonight by Phil Collins about how damaging hateful language is Supernatural  - this is a dance track but it's very different from any she's done before Out Alive - another dance track with an Ace of Base feel to it Gold Trans Am - a rock track that samples We Will Rock You and Sweet Home Alabama Only Wanna Dance With You  - a cute, bubble gum rock track  Most songs on this album is good to excellent. If you have kids, the clean version of the album is verywell done. After listening to the explicit version, I thought the clean might sound horrible but the songs with the most bad words have the words replaced rather than cut out. Also, check out her unreleased songs on Youtube. Sunday Morning, I'm the One, Lucky, While You Were Sleeping, Baby, It's You, Disgusting, Feels Like Rain, Things Work Out My Way, Shots on the Hood of My Car and Butterscotch are some good ones.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was a great read that kept me engaged.  Started a little slow, but got better as I read on.
B00117W1HQ|4.0|This was better than I thought it would be. It had all the fears and horrors you had growing up and multiplied them. There is some serious thought that went into the storylines.
B009AMALGM|2.0|The first two in the series were well done. PA 1 and PA 2 were occuring at approximately the same time, so it was a good reconciliation of the chain of events as we experienced them. PA 3 offered more of the backstory as to why these events were happening. PA 4 is tied to that backstory.<br /><br />My biggest issue with PA 4 is that, where the first couple of movies offered a reasonable and believable cause for the remote cameras and coverage, this was more of a stretch. It involves the teenage daughter and her tech savvy boyfriend networking the electronics in the home to offer 24/7 coverage, plus carrying their laptops or camera everywhere with them to capture events outside of the house. It was ridiculous. Even in moments of extreme duress, they always had the camera recording.<br /><br />There were some good effects, my favorite being the scenes involving the XBox Kinect data points.
B005P58PIO|4.0|The cw sequel version of Nikita has feet that definitely hold its own. The introduction of cleaners/guardians has a whole new vision over the original. I never missed an episode.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|It does not work on my new touchtab 7. Blank screen.  I wanted a conveneint way to read books and docs anywhere.  I gather there is a major problem with android 4! And kindle.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|I really liked it but now I hats it it is so boring no one I know likes it and that's a lot of people that I known so don't bye it unless you like or love really stupid games like this really stupid game of sally Solon's. so. DO NOT BYE THIS GAME
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Anyone who has fallen in love, anyone who was a teenager, anyone who knows or knew someone who is/was terminally ill would get something out of this story.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This sequel is actually better than its predecessor. It features fun new obstacles while providing familiar tools and faces to help you navigate through the new temple.<br /><br />Usually, I am a stickler for the original, but I am more than impressed with TR2. There are still a few bugs, and sometimes it takes forever to load, but with a little patience, you'll have tons of fun or at least a meaningful distraction from boring lectures. Imangi has done it again!

B00003CXXS|5.0|Not only is Jurassic Park III the best out of all of them, but it truly brings on the terrifying moments when Dr. Alan Grant and Mr. and Mrs. Kirby face when stranded on Isla Sorna while looking for their son who got stranded on the island eight weeks earlier. Evading the gigantic spinosaurus and the veloceraptors this movie brings out the best of Jurassic Park.

B009AMALGM|5.0|Although Paranormal Activity received very low ratings, I believe it deserves five stars. It really brings on the scares all the way to the shocking ending, which leaves you wanting more. Well to some people this film may be a joke, but as a die hard fan of the series I can't help but love it. With this purchase my collection is complete and now I own all four Paranormals'. I you love the first three I recommend you buy this one.

0140157352|4.0|This is one of those books I bought partially as an impulse-purchase and partially because I figured it would help me with a topic I'm interested in: argumentation/debate.<br /><br />While some of the principles in this book can be applied to argumentation/debate, it is first and foremost a book on negotiation--the sort of book a suit-and-tie type would be caught reading on their flight to some big city conference.<br /><br />Thin as this book is (under 200 pages) there are lots of themes that they beat you over the head with. For example, separate the person from the problem, argue over principles not positions, etc. However this repetition does serve its purpose of making sure the material sticks.<br /><br />What's more, this stuff WORKS!<br /><br />As a real-life example from today. My wife was firmly set on going to the Olive Garden tomorrow night. I wanted to go to the Texas Roadhouse restaurant.<br />Now before reading this book, I would have argued on the position: I make the money and I'm not really keen on spending money on a restaurant I don't particularly like (Olive Garden).<br />But having read this book, I did something different that the book recommended. Check out the motive (for why my wife wanted to eat at the Olive Garden).<br />As it turns out, it wasn't so much that she was craving pasta, but that she wanted to eat someplace different, someplace where we hadn't been to in a while.<br />As a result, I did something else this book recommends: I invented an alternative: Let's go to this Japanese Steakhouse that would satisfy both of our cravings.<br /><br />So thanks to this book, instead of either one of us grudgingly eating at Olive Garden or Texas Roadhouse, we are now going to happily eat at a Japanese Steakhouse.

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I've read all the John Corey novels that Nelson Demille has written.  I'd put &#34;The Panther&#34; somewhere in the bottom two.  It's not that it wasn't interesting.  It was set in Yeman, where Corey was on assignment before.  There's a lot of local information that kept me interested in the area.  But when you get to the plotline/story it just seems to meander like Demille was just going day to day saying what should happen to John and Kate next?  The supposed main villain, &#34;The Panther&#34;, was a weak knock off of Asad Khalil.  Paul Brenner, from The General's Daughter, plays a supporting role in this story, but if you've never read the other book then you'd never know who he is from this story.  John and Kate are exactly the same as they've been in every book since The Lion's Game.  I read this book really just to reunite with John Corey again.  Some people would say that he's become a one dimensional character, all wise-cracks and no substance.  I'm fine with the character.  His antics are what make these books funny and interesting.  I just wish that Nelson Demille would put him into more believable scenarios.  By the end of the book I was more interested in who was really double-crossing who than whether or not Corey was going to meet up with the &#34;Panther&#34;.  I mean, you just know that Corey is going to go mano-a-mano with him eventually, even though there seems to be no point to it by the end of the book.  Overall, this book read like a two-week entry in John Corey's diary.  Entertaining because of who the character is, but the story wasn't very believable.  Hopefully, Demille will get John Corey back in the USA where he's really in his element.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|I bought this book at the behest of a friend, and to be fair I enjoyed it quite a bit.  It was easy, funny, a quick read, and pretty interesting.<br /><br />To me the biggest selling points are the humor and the background information on the various deities.  I don't usually laugh out loud during a reading, and I did catch myself chuckling aloud from time to time.  I also appreciated the amount of research that went into the book, as it's obvious Mr. Hearne knows quite a bit about his subject matter, so in that respect I feel like I learned a few things, which was great.  The book was also very creative!<br /><br />I have one major piece of criticism, but unfortunately for me it brought down the total score quite a bit.  The book is unevenly written.  Humor, written to great effect in some places, simply doesn't work in others, resulting in an uneven understanding of some of the main characters.  For instance, the protagonist has a talking dog.  The dog is hilarious, at times, but in others his humor seems out of place or unlikely (I recognize that this is a talking dog, so all bets are out the window.  But everyone knows what dogs are like, and even a really well-read, smart, funny dog is, well, a dog.  I think the character would have been more likeable/believable if he was more like a dog, less like a comedian.  Look at the dog from &#34;Up!&#34;  Perfectly written talking dog!!).  The dog's humor - and the protagonist's - is often misplaced, serving only to drain the tension from a scene.  Indeed, throughout the book there's constant attempts at humor (many of which work, to varying degrees, which is great), but this humor often ruins the tension and drama, ingredients essential to a great story.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the book is that the author doesn't do a particularly successful job building up characters or helping the reader achieve a true understanding of them.  Some of the main characters (the main antagonist and his witch sidekick, for instance), are brought up throughout the book as main characters, and yet, they're only sketchily drawn when we finally see them (both their personalities and their descriptions).  Because of this, by the time the final showdown occurs I really didn't feel all that connected to the good guys, or feel much antagonism for the bad guys.  Things just sort of happened, without any emotional repercussions.<br /><br />When you get down to it, I couldn't shake the feeling that throughout the book the author was so set on making jokes that the plot itself suffered.  I don't think that needs to be the case.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a good book, it really is, but because I came away from it feeling little connection to the characters or plot, I simply wasn't invested in getting the sequel.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe readily engages his first post-Harry Potter lead role in this suitably spooky, nicely atmospheric ghost story.  Those looking for a good story, rather than senseless gore, will be satisfied I think.
0345528581|4.0|It's a bare bones, efficient and effective map for creating and getting a hardcore workout, anywhere, with no equipment and in very little time.  It cripples all the excuses you may have around not getting it done.  Although he touchs on diet, the meat and potatoes is definitely in the strength training chapters. You may never go back to a Gymn again; with this book, you won't need to.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Darker, with a tone of finality in the proceedings, this \\"Harry Potter\\" conclusion has all the expert technical achievements we've come to expect and more.  It is clear that the three leads (Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) all have the capability to move on to greater heights, but we will always remember them for their contributions to this most entertaining of movie franchises.

B0031TZ8TU|4.0|I am a big fan of Ken Follett and lthough this is an actual event that occured, he did great research as usual to find out everything about this arrest and rescue attempt in Iran. He also shows how Ross Perot stands by his workers and their familes and will use all his resources he has to try to free his men. In a very violent Iran when riots are occurring daily. My advice give it a try I really enjoyed it.

B004TI5N38|3.0|I have been a long-standing fan of novels by David Baldacci, but found his newest hero here, the CIS investigator &#34;Puller&#34; almost to be superhuman and therefore not very believable. The setting for this story (Drake, West Virginia) which begins with gruesome murders and circles in circles of plot twists around an abandoned 1960's &#34;cement dome&#34; and what it hides comes to an explosive (no pun intended) climax that I found too drawn out and too unrealistic. The chapters added on after this climax -- getting to the ringleader behind it all, seemed just beyond credibility.<br /><br />I did read it cover to cover, and I do have on my Kindle the next installment (I actually began the next installment first, realized I should read ZERO DAY first, and so switched to that. I hope THE FORGOTTEN is not as contrived. I did complete his latest novel, THE INNOCENT, and also found it stretching things a bit with the characters, although the story was interesting enough.<br /><br />I feel his newest &#34;heroes&#34; are not as believable as the members of THE CAMEL CLUB or his twin detectives, KING and MAXWELL but that may just be me. I do feel a bit let down with the descriptive narrative I so appreciated in the past with all of David Baldacci's novels. Here in ZERO DAY it was just not as interesting and colorful, but maybe that was the point in describing rural West Virginia?

B007L3BMGA|2.0|Just does not have sufficient enough plot.  Dominant man stands over inexperienced young woman and submits her to varies sexual perversions in BDSM.

B0086213XW|5.0|This is one of the most endearing love stories I have ever watched.  It is never predictable, meanders in a lovely and believable way, slowly revealing these characters' lives.  Seth Rogan is really touching as the cuckolded husband. Lou Kirby is hot.  Sarah Silverman delivers a remarkably nuanced performance.  And the use of the Leonard Cohen song is inspired.  I just loved it and hope it wins something this year.
0545265355|5.0|In a nutshell the Hunger Games trilogy covers three books. In this world there are different districts that are forced to participate in a set of games called the Hunger Games.  These games force children to fight in a battle to the death that is repeated every year. Katniss is the principal character of the story.  She ends up participating in the games and her experience causes a chain of events that have significant ramifications for all of the districts in unexpected ways.  I feel like if I say anymore than that it will spoil the story, so I will leave it at that.<br /><br />In the beginning I had originally planned on just seeing the movies, but after hearing so much about the books I broke down and bought the trilogy.  I am glad that I did (I read the entire trilogy in a weekend).  Katniss is an great heroine and the story is well written throughout the books.  The books are not as mature as some other series (e.g. A Song of Fire and Ice), but they do have a surprising amount of thought provoking themes (e.g., Self-discovery, poverty, torture, death, etc.) that I was surprised to find in a book series that is supposed to be geared to teens (I am in my late 20s).  They were all great books, but my favorites (in order) were Catching Fire, The Hunger Games, and Mockingjay.<br /><br />I have seen the first movie, and it is good considering how the book is written, but the books are A LOT better since the story is told from a first-person point of view.  Katniss' thoughts are what make her develop so well as a character and this is lost in the movie.  Therefore, even if you watch the movies I highly recommend that you read the books as well.  You will get surprisingly attached to the characters and the storyline is very addicting.  You will get the most out of the series as Katniss' thoughts are significant in how many of the events are described.<br /><br />Great series and easy reads.  Highly recommended!
1439116881|5.0|This is a wonderfully written, entertaning novel.  While reading it, I laughed, and I cried.<br />More than that, I found it full of valuable educational material.<br />I have a dear lady friend who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.<br />This book helped me to better understand how this disease affects the mind.<br />Of course, everyone of is unique, and the disease affects different people in different ways, but there were instances of behavior that I read about in the book that have given me effectve tools in caring for my friend and better meetng her needs.<br />Still, it is so well written as a novel I had the added pleasure of a good read.<br />Kudos to Lisa Genova for her tremendous wit and wisdom.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've been reading \\"Proof of Heaven\\" on my Kindle for the last couple of days on my commute. I'm always drawn to non-fiction, though not this particular subject matter. I'm Catholic and I (happily) believe in and trust God, and so I didn't need to be convinced. But the fact that the book is written by a neurosurgeon interested me and I wanted to read about the transformation of his own thought process about the existence of God.<br /><br />First: In addition to being a skydiver, a Harvard grad and a neurosurgeon, this man can write! This little book is part action-story, autobiography, medical dictionary and Stephen King novel.<br /><br />Second: Because of the exceptional storytelling and writing, I was hooked after two pages. I really wanted to make time to just sit down and read the whole thing at once; alas, that did not happen. So I read it in fits and starts on the train. Even so, it was a quick and easy read.<br /><br />Third: I don't know if it will convince skeptics but if this story doesn't do it, nothing will. The author spends quite a bit of time on his childhood, youth and young adulthood, basically setting up the fact that he's a highly educated, intellectual, medical professional who absolutely doubted the existence of God until he fell into a week-long coma as a result of bacterial meningitis. His description of what happened during that week is beautiful, sometimes scary/creepy, but ultimately comforting and loving.<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is not about religion or politics; it is about the author's discovery of the existence of God. No judgement, just one man's (very interesting) spiritual journey and his attempt to explain it to the rest of us.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed every aspect of this game.  I especially liked the hint option.  I cannot wait to play the sequel.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I do no often read in the fantasy genre. As a matter of fact, I haven't read in this genre since the early '90s. However, when I watched Game of Thrones on HBO, I had to get this book. Now I am hooked. The best part about this series is you can never expect the expected. I highly recommend this book and I look forward to the rest of the series.
0385535147|3.0|I just finished The Racketeer by John Grisham and despite having to suspend belief for 340 pages, I enjoyed the novel very much. It was a fun, quick read. There is no doubt that John Grisham can tell a story that holds a reader's interest. The story-line is over-the-top. The protagonist, a convict serving his term in Federal prison, was able to carry-out an unbelievable plan, have access to an exorbitant amount of money, and easily dupe the authorities. Though I would have thought I would have found the story ridiculous, surprisingly, I did not. I kept reading, and I had a good time doing so. If you are looking for a book to escape into, then this is the book for you, but you must be willing to over-look the incredible plot. I would have given 3 1/2 stars if the option was available.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent, was wonderful way to catch up on the episodes I missed.<br />Did have a little trouble streaming one of them, but that was an issue with the carrier not you.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|Most of the review bash this product especially being so connected with apple. Well the concept and features are awesome. The constant disconnecting from the network is insane. Sometimes its every other minute. This is way too unreliable especially when you have a new born. It does work better in my old iphone 4. not good on the 5. i am contemplating getting a regular monitor
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Want Rio update bad and this game is like so amazing my brother Just updated for his phone and Rio update is pretty cool
B000002ADT|5.0|It's the beginning of jazz. Miles Davis is absolutely amazing.  I appreciate jazz from that time period then now. I love it everytime it plays.
B001KQEE0U|4.0|2Pac is, as a rapper, near the height of popularity, so the exaggerated title of this album isn't too far off. All \\"Eyez\\" aren't on him, but a mixture of vanity and paranoia probably makes it seem that way from his point of view. It's still Me Against The World, in other words. Everyone else is just waiting to see what his next move is going to be. And if we're looking, we're listening. So this album is for the whole world.<br /><br />It will be heard by the rap music crowds more than anyone else though. And in that category, it holds its own. 2Pac isn't the best rapper or anywhere near the best, the thug poet rarely has anything clever or particularly creative to say, but there is something to be said for his distinct sing-songy flow in which he randomly emphasizes words by stretching syllables and putting an exclamation mark at the end.<br /><br />If it's not impressive enough on its own, and I don't think it is, it sounds a lot better over a sleek array of well-produced hip-hop beats. There are also a lot of decent guest rappers, almost every song has one, but it's the guest singers that really stand-out. When one provides a catchy hook, that song instantly becomes one of the best and 2Pac, the rapper, shines more than he could probably ever shine on his own.<br /><br />The second half of this two-pack, a double album as far as CDs and cassettes are concerned, is superior in that regard. Run Tha Streetz is catchy and romantic, or at-least as romantic as 2Pac songs get, and Thug Passion is all you really need in the bedroom. Even when he's calling out enemies in a violent rage, daring them to Holla at him, a singer is right there instigating it with melodic taunts of her own.<br /><br />With that, the album, like most double albums, would do better as one set of, say, its best fourteen or thirteen tracks. That means weaker songs like When We Ride, Hearts Of Men and How Do U Want It; not all the singer hooks do well; would have to go. But even as is, there are enough interesting things happening in the way of side hooks, ad-libs and monologues, to hold your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />marcellee.comgh interesting things happening in the way of side hooks, ad-libs and monologues, to hold your attention from beginning to end.<br /><br />marcellee.com
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Have had it in the CD player in my car since it arrived. Her voice evokes an emotional response. Wonderful!
B002Z58GQI|4.0|Plenty of space.  Great value.<br /><br />I purchased this to hand in a university thesis paper and presentation.  I bought two.  One held all of my research and materials for my paper.  One to hand in my final submission.  Zero problem.<br /><br />One thing I fear is losing one of these.  The hole you see on the picture is not big enough to fit on a keychain.  Also, the cap does not secure well and can easily come off and be lost.  If you have somewhere to keep this secure without losing it and easy access, good buy.
1400052181|5.0|As a cancer survivor myself I found the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family so very painful.  I appreciate the research but truly feel patient rights are imperative. God bless Henrietta Lacks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King since I was 13 years old.  Fire Starter was the first book of his I read, and it inspired my life long love of reading (I am now 39).  I thank Mr. King for this.  11/22/63 is a wonderfully chilling love story with lines so poetic, at times I was in awe.  Buy this book, you won't be sorry.
1421550644|5.0|I absolutely loved the movie of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind, so when I found out there was a manga I was ecstatic. And I was not disappointed. The manga delves much deeper than the movie, examining the invisible strings that bind all living things together. Other topics include peace and war, environmentalism, feminism, the origin of religion, rule by nobility vs rule by the church, and genetic modification, among other things. The story is not for the faint of heart and I wouldn't recommend it for young kids as there are disturbing depictions of war, but I think everyone should read this collection at some point in their lives.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Great game.  The only issue I was upset about is I got pretty far in the game and when I quit. And. Came back it started<br /><br /> me back at the beginning erasing all my progress<br />And the coins I had purchased.
B000002KY8|4.0|... it would've made a killer &#34;single&#34; album. IMO it's the first four songs (1999, L.R. Corvette, Delirious, Let's Pretend) -- i.e., the hits -- that make this one of Prince's best. These four songs alone are 22 minutes, about a third of the total time. The remainder hangs together well -- albeit without a standout track.<br /><br />This is no _Purple Rain,_ but very few albums are. If you just want &#34;1999&#34; and &#34;Little Red Corvette,&#34; I'd suggest a greatest hits album. If you've heard the hits and are interested in hearing more from Prince, this album (or _Purple Rain_) is probably a good starting point.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is one of the best apps I've downloaded but the sound stays on, I was listening to pandora and after my song I heard the character running.
1600595871|4.0|very nice book, many great book making ideas. Some redundancy but otherwise very nice and colorful. many photos and clear directions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The Best Game EVERRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I love every thing about it and I think it really helps u and gives a lesson for saga also go v e details
B004MC8CA2|2.0|this is just difficult to use, constantly getting a tool bar down the reading screen. it is a hassle to have to fight with that. help answers that are pre programmed and tries to pick one.  not happy with this and will dump when i find something else/
B006L9B6TI|4.0|With many of Rhonda Byrne books. This is another book that inspires you in Guideness and lessons to apply and learn in your daily life.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|this app looks okay but I saw a lot of bad reviews. oh well got it anyway. hope its good!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app is very effective and it keeps you up to date on news and information on people and news that you follow.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Easy to put on & people are always commenting on my white iphone. They want one now. I just use my phone so little I didn't like or want the big & bulky cover.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love the show and decided to read the books and this first one was very similar to the first episode of the show is! I love it!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Outstanding book. Creative, fast and delicate. I will definitely see the movie when it comes out! Q a d a
076790592X|5.0|I give this book a lot to people who are dealing with aging parents and the struggles that brings with it.  Its moving, simple to read and very much touches on the heart and soulful expereince of dealing with life and death maturely.
B000M341RI|4.0|I loved this movie. It's about a group of unemployed steel workers who get the idea to strip as a way of earning some quick cash. Robert Carlyle plays Gaz, a divorced father with a young son. When an issue arises regarding back child support and the possibility of losing his right to visitation, Gaz convinces a group of his friends to go along with him and perform a Chippendale's type show at a local club. There's just one little detail he leaves out when attempting to sell his idea...They will be doing the 'Full Monty'...stripping completely naked! Hilarity ensues while watching these six ordinary guys attempt to choreograph a dance routine. This movie made me laugh for obvious reasons, but I also found myself cheering for them by the end of the movie. If you are a fan of Robert Carlyle...this is a MUST SEE!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I couldn't put this down. I really enjoy Ken Follett's writing; I feel like I'm in the thick of it.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I was excited to get this item. I watched every episode and all the special features. They were very good. I would recommend this product to anybody!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|This is the shiz!  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep track of calories and how far they are running!  Very easy to use!  The only drawback would be it is kind of bulky, but I'm also fairly small so I deal!  Buy it!
B005HSL626|2.0|I have always like the Fruit Ninja games and was excited to get it for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  However, it crashes all too frequently and had to delete it for it's general unplayability.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this app soooo much. i play it all of the time. i love horses so much so i decided to get it and i love it very much. i can honestly say GET IT NOW WHILE ITS FREE. its for all ages
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The first Temple Run was a very fun and addicting game.  This one carries the torch well.  The updated graphics are beautiful and the game play has been tweaked enough that it feels fresh despite (in concept) being basically the same game as the first one.  It does however, suffer from some bugs at this time (a major one that I've come across is using the &#34;Save Me&#34; power in the minecart sections crashing the game) which keeps it from being a 5 star game for me.  For a free game though there is no reason not to give this excellent game a chance.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Just the nname of this series made me think I would not be interested but after playing the game and talking to friends, I decided to give it a whirl.  I have been totally engrossed in this show.  Highly recommended
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season continues to be as good as the original. I can hardly wait for the next episode of British drama.
B008B92U32|1.0|When you go to the gallery and pick a picture, it goes back to the main screen with nothing.  Too bad seemed neat.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I am very happy with the DVD I purchased. It is a great movie and it was in perfect shape when it showed up. The price was really good and the shipping price was good. It showed up on time like it was supposed to. I am definitely happy with this transaction and will definitely do business with this seller again. Thank You.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The most beautiful book i have had the pleasure of reading for a long while.<br />Im glad i didnt rush through it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Probably the best book I have ever read. It shows the true lid  of being a United States Navy SEAL. I would recommend  to ages 13+.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|Have loved this delightful holiday movie since I saw it in the theater years ago. Definitely pull it out every Christmas, but watch it a few times during the rest of the year too. It's a funny, smart, sentimental romance worth owning.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved these books more than anything. I couldn't stop reading. I would love to see other people reading this book because it's so heart felt loving and best of all you feel like you are in the book with all these characters and you are dealing with all of this. I almost cried in many parts of this book.<br />So, in conclusion I recommend you read this book
B0012GMVDK|5.0|Great album, fair price, no problems.  Happy with vendor and product. . . . . . . . . .

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game great upgrades very easy to play great time killer only downfall takes forever to collect coins and characters cost way to much.of course they want you spend real money.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|I bought this for my mother-in-law as a X'mas gift.<br /><br />We watched this show almost everytime we visited her and still love it.<br /><br />Great price and wonderful gift.

B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I just found the story and the writing juvenile. The incest, which is a pivoting point, is predictable in the first chapter &#34;the twisting doornob&#34; Also, how realistic is it to think that in today's world, you can keep a child without any  Lovestruck teens; I think this may be a good read for a 9th or 10th grader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very fun and addicting game It is really fun and I play it all the time boss
0425263908|5.0|Very Good Could not put it down I just bought the next one and I will anxiously await the third !!!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This is a story that could not be made up.  This guy made music in the 1970's without commercial success (so he thought).  To this day he lives and does manual labor in Detroit.  Many fans assumed he was dead.  Little did he know that he was a superstar &#34;revolutionary&#34; in apartheid South Africa.  So in addition to the music, the story is quite remarkable, well-told in this dcumentary video.
1449410243|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend, and I wept reading parts of it before I gave it to her...then my eyes watered even further after she opened it, because it's quite funny and that's the sort of thing that happens when you laugh at evil cartoon cats.  :)
B007X1ZQSU|4.0|I just bought this set so although I havent received it yet I do know that Thin Lizzy was one of the most kick a$$ bands of the 70s.  My only gripe is that I absolutely love the Eric Bell albums, why arent they represented?  The first two albums are certainly better than say, \\"Fighting\\".<br /><br />I am still stoked about getting updated versions of all these classics of my teenage years listening.
B005D63ICI|3.0|I love watching Dexter however this was not my favorite season.  I am looking forward to season six.  So far the second season has been my favorite.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Such a gentle movie set in more innocent times -- no 'techie' stuff.  Two young 'misfits' find each other and go adventuring.

B007SSDS24|3.0|It is an interesting movie concept but lacking in depth or resolution. It looked more like a series premiere that didn't quite get your interest up enough to watch the series. Not the best sci fi film I've seen.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This was cleverly done and worked for a short Movie and Food Christmas party with our staff of different ages and interests.  I appreciated the fast ship time.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Another great romp with the men in black and their aliens friends and foes! Great acting, great action and awesome special effects. Definately recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love it. It's fast, fun but warning, it is addicting. Once you try it you will love it also!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This is a very entertaining film.  Great action and special effects.  Good story with unexpected twists and turns right up to the very last scene.  Watch it at least twice to catch the subtle nuances that make this a great time twisted story. Time travel stories are necessarily complex but this one pulls it off really well. I will definately watch it a few more times now that I know all of the unexpected aspects of the plot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!! it is very realistic and the graphics are amazing! why aren't there any other games like this one?
B0051OZ564|4.0|This has great actionand the overall video game look to the movie is interesting.  The plot is a little weak for a movie.  It would probably be OK as a theme for a video game but as a movie it falls short.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I don't like ir on the kindle fire because it wont update to 0.6.0but everyone who has the ipod or ipad has it
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|The special effects and CGI in this film are outstanding.  Fast action, great scenes, good characters and plot.  Very good sci fi movie.  I would easily watch it again.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I liked the first temple run a lot and this one might have better graphics but it can be really disorienting at times with the curves in the path and the hills.  I also think the character power ups are very confusing.  I think if you want temple run go original.
B007VDN1PA|2.0|I was really impressed with the design, concept and ease of use. Problem is that the film holder gets dusty and even with very clean film and use of air cleaner amount of spots on the scan is beyond practicality. If that issue is resolved i would buy this product again. I guess that &#34;open window&#34; film guide would be better as one would need to deal with a dust on the film only i/o having another layer in between.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is much better than Temple Run. It is much more realistic, and there are more things like going through a mine.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Although this one is no THE FIRM, or THE PELICAN BRIEF, it is certainly in the category of great books. I loved every minute of it, and I probably will read it one more time.  The Super books, I read four or five times.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is a good book for teenagers because it openly talks about issues that confront them everyday.  The book is well written keeping the reader's interest throughout.  Also, a happy ending, which makes for good entertainment.
B0015346OM|5.0|Bowden tells the story in an easy to understand format reigning in several accounts and events.  A must read for anyone needing an inspirational story of overcoming hardship

B004DLPXAO|5.0|The only app I use on my phone, the cure all for boredom! I 100% prefer reading on the phone to the kindle, since it is much lighter. I always have what I need in a purse, not need to remember to grab another gadget!

0525953590|5.0|I purchased this book for my husband---he's finished reading and has raved about it throughout!  He said that it was &#34;readable&#34; even for a novice!  He's done quite a bit of reading in this area and this one WAS A HIT!!!  He's eager to read MORE of Sean Carroll!  :-))
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!!! It reminds of the carnival game back when I was a little girl. I get so excited when I get a prize or complete a level.
B005HXGE9G|5.0|Peter has done it again with a very well done album of new and old songs.  If symphonic rock is something that you appreciate, this album is for you.  The score is very well done and includes awesome string movements, brass section, and percussion. The album will take you on a acoustical ride that feels fresh every time I listen to the two albums.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great book!  I liked even better than the first book from the trilogy.  I thought the historical information was very interesting - learned a lot!

B007U4DIM6|5.0|This movie was cute, funny, entertaining. Some of the negative reviews are ridiculous. It's entertainment, not a documentary on the sex lives of dogs. Give me a break. Lighten up.<br /><br />Two kids and four adults all enjoyed it. However, the 'dig' about home schooling was not necessary - but just what would you expect from liberals in Hollywood.<br /><br />Recommend you watch first two before watching #3.
B00AXVIBKW|5.0|True North is a tight and fast album.  It sounds more like &#34;Suffer&#34; than it does &#34;The Dissent of Man&#34;.<br /><br />It's Bad Religion,  if you know them, this fits well with their discography, if this is your first Bad Religion album, it's a good start.
0307887448|4.0|This was a fun novel. An interesting quest that keeps moving at a brisk pace, likeable (if somewhat two-dimensional) characters and the author's easy-breezy writing style make for one of those books that suck you in and keep you turning pages late into the night. I was an 80's geek (not quite so hardcore as Cline), so many of the references resonated with me. But I don't think that is a prerequisite to enjoy the story, as Cline does a fairly good job of explaining situations, for example, in video games that I wasn't familiar with. Unfortuantely, I found the 80's references, especially in the first half of the novel, to be laid on a bit thick. Cline really pounds the reader over the head with movie, music and video game references, and you can tell he's fully indulging in his own nostalgia for these things. Alas, I couldn't help wondering if a high-school kid (Wade) in 2044 would look upon the 1980's as \\"nostalgia\\" or as \\"ancient history\\". I suppose it could be argued that the protagonists in this story share a special view of the 1980's that maybe the general population of 2044 wouldn't have.<br /><br />I read that Warner Bros. bought movie rights for this one day after the publishing deal was signed. That's not surprising. The book reads like a screeplay in the vein of War Games or a John Hughes movie. The Good Guys are just a tad too clever and lucky, while the Bad Guys have unlimited power but are idiots. But that's okay, because this book doesn't try to be complex or thought-provoking. It's unabashedly simple, straightforward and exciting. I respect a story that doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is. And this one is a lot of fun.
0393064476|3.0|What I expected was a thorough discussion of the way the content of Lucretius's book, On the Nature of Things, influenced thinkers and led to modern concepts. Instead, the vast majority of the book dealt with the life and times of the man who found the book, and how he arranged to have it copied by hand back in the 15th Century.  While all that was interesting, I kept waiting for more substance. The author finally dispatched what I felt was the meat of the subtitle in only a few pages, and it felt tacked-on, not the main point of the book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Great, helped keep me charged.  Would recommend it to anyone that has a Kindle Fire.  A must have for sure.
B008B92U32|2.0|well, I can take a picture, but editing it causes the image to jump around, unpredictably, under the mask.  I can't get the masks to go into and out of resize mode reliably.  Cool concept. Maybe version 2 will work better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing book! Kept me on the edge of my chair not wanting to put it down but also had a few spots where the tears flowed. As a mother I could not imagine. If you want to know what I am talking about pick up the book and read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game I give it a 5star review. It is my favorot game. I am addictedto it. It is all I like to play I just keep going
030758836X|2.0|I will admit the first 1/3s of the book was definitely \\"page turning don't want to put it down\\" love that you feel when you pick up a really good book BUT the beginning of the book doesn't make up for the somewhat forced middle of the book.  Without giving too much away does the author really think I'm supposed to believe this super intelligent individual was outwitted by societal drop outs?  Then I get to the last 1/3 of the book that essentially ruined the whole book for me.  The middle of the book began to cause me to roll my eyes at the lack of character development.  The last chapters were so ill-conceived and amateurish as to render the sharp writing the author displayed in the beginning of the book as just ridiculous!  By the final page I was upset I had invested precious time and energy in this unsatisfying froth that it actually left me wishing I had never started the book to begin with and taking the next step which is a first for me an avid book reader, warning my friends to avoid the book as well.  It really seemed the author took a vacation in the middle of writing this novel then had to hustle to meet a deadline so she just churned out some drivel without really thinking it through.  I really do believe that a book should be judged by the individual so by all means check it out from your local library (don't waste your money) and then let me know if you disagree. The one time in my 44 years that I have ever discouraged someone from reading a book but it truly was a colossal waste of my time!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|The game itself is fun. the only problem is it has reset twice already. I unlocked some of the characters, and got the 30X multiplier then the game reset. I unlocked the characters again got the 30X multiplier again... and it reset again.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I was just trying to find something to watch when I came upon \\"Searching For Sugar Man\\".  After seeing all the positive reviews, I figured I'd give it a try.  It was once of the most amazing stories I've ever heard.  I've bought the soundtrack and will soon be buying the movie so that I can watch it again & again.  If this doesn't win the Academy Award for best documentary then the fix is in!!!<br />Love, love, loved this movie!!!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|There is a little too much profanity in the book. I am sure it is to make a point about the main character, but is a little over the top. The book writing style seems a little basic, words just written down, without thought on how to present the story in a more elegant way. There are many typos in the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is great. It goes from easy to fast and the longer you play without crashing,it goes faster.Very addicting. Has different daily challenges.

B004SKJTY6|1.0|I expected something a little longer than a trailer length snippet. It was not the full film, or even a full interview about the film.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun, but has plenty of opportunities to spend money!  This app is great for everyone who loves horses.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|even better than the first one. they added a zip line!!!!! maps and graphics are even better. oh yeah baby
B004LROUNG|5.0|I loved the David and<br /> Goliath theme! John Grisham is definitely on his game in this one! This is a \\"feel good\\" read.
B0088X7YU0|4.0|I was a bit worried about this one, since the previous numbered sequels were ... not so good. However, this sequel/spin-off was actually pretty good. The pacing is a bit hectic, and the dialogue is dumb, but it was still a fun movie. I can recommend this film for anime and Starship Troopers fans.
B00004YRQA|5.0|Anyone who want to purchase this memory card. I never had any problem it did the job.  it as alot storage

B00992CF6W|5.0|I guess I should say that they really love Minecraft.  It is really fun to listen to them talk about the worlds they are building.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Bought these headphones for 60$ after remembering a review on G4 tv.  This product is amazing (especially the bass)  and does not cost a lot, what more could you want?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Keeps me and the kid quiet for hours :) the Rio a bit slow at the moment but hey ho
B006LSZECO|5.0|Good book, kept my interest.  Kept me on the edge of my seat. I would definitely read more books by Gillian Flynn.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun. the horses are pretty. the competitions are easy. but the gems are uselessly slow to earn to buy cool stuff.  and ever since I reached level 15 ive been getting annoying ad pop ups.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Another book I couldn't get interested in. Now my daughter loves everything he writes. Sorry it's not my kind of book.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I hope everyone plays this game.  I had so much fun.  The graphics and sound are wonderful.  Kept you thinking all the time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have, for many years, enjoyed Mitch Rapp as a&#34;white hat&#34; in Vince Flynn's novels.  This book was no exception.<br />Having read other reviews of this book, I must also comment that Flynn is on top of the heap for action, intrigue and<br />timely storylines.  Unlike others, I did not find this to be lacking in the Flynn pace, quality and plot twists that we have<br />come to expect from him.  Hate that I can read these books faster than they can be written.
1423101499|5.0|Why read: Reading the series<br /><br />What impressed me: I have such absolute love for this series. It continues to impress me with the entertaining manner it teaches mythology, much more than just the basics. The Battle of the Labyrinth delves much deeper into the subject than anything I ever learned in school and I'm loving every minute of it. Percy continues to grow and change, taking on more and having to really start dealing the the hard decisions of life, both demigod and mortal. He continues to gain the respect of his elders and there's a scene with his father that is just completely perfect.<br /><br />What disappointed me: What is Annabeth's problem? Girlish jealousy or something more? It's seriously starting to grate on my nerves.<br /><br />Recommended: Most definitely. This series keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />Continue series: How could I not? The end is close and I need to know what happens.
B007TTFXLQ|5.0|amy macdonald is great, the cd came with some scratches on it though. that causes a few skips  thats a little aggravating.
140123755X|5.0|Why read: Popped up as an Amazon recommendation and looked interesting<br /><br />What impressed me: I read the synopsis and thought this had possibility. I wasn't prepared for how really good it would be. We all know fairy tales of our childhoods of Disney overload. This is amped up fairy tales for adults. The same characters we all know, but in a whole new way. What happens once the happily-ever-after has past and real life sets in. A murder mystery with more edge than you'd even expect from the likes of Snow White or Jack Sprat.<br /><br />What disappointed me: Nothing. This really surprised me.<br /><br />Recommended: Absolutely. It's completely unexpected and familiar all at once.<br /><br />Continue series: Most definitely.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These are great for gaming or listening to music.  Very clear highs and mids with very punchy base.  The cord is well made and sturdy, and a great useful length as well.  This is the best-sounding gaming  headset I've ever had - I'll be buying another.

I don't like missing out on updates
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A great addition to the Super Hero Movie line. I recommend and comic book fan get this movie for the collection...spoiler alert - the Hulk and Loki scene at Stark HQs is absolutely priceless. Worth the price of the video alone. Hope they continue to produce sequels.

0062218867|4.0|Pratchett does here what he is good at - satirize a form/class/belief system in the framework of a compellingly told story while making glancing references to pop culture and history, and doing it all in a humorous vein.  This may not be his best work, but it's still quite good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  This A good game for anyone who likes temple run.  It seems like it is temple run only in the subway.  This is a awesome awesome game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have never seen a game so cool. this game is the bomb.I really, really, really, like this game.it is the coolest in the world.
B004SDEP38|1.0|Their first thing you see is the words 'create Microsoft word p.point or excel' but it's not there, it won't even display them correctly. I don't recommend this app to anybody.
B000W21ER4|1.0|I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?<br /><br />To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.<br /><br />After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.<br /><br />On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.<br /><br />A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):<br /><br />I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.<br /><br />If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as &#34;You're just jealous!&#34; or &#34;I'd like to see you do better!&#34; or &#34;How is it in your parents' basement?&#34; or &#34;You must jerk off to your computer!&#34; These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter athand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:<br /><br />&#34;Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!&#34;<br /><br />FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!<br /><br />If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.<br /><br />To those of you who would call me &#34;pretentious&#34; or &#34;music snob&#34; or &#34;self-righteous&#34; or &#34;self-absorbed,&#34; you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is &#34;simple,&#34; (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:<br /><br />&#34;Devil's Night Out&#34; by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones<br />&#34;Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols&#34; by The Sex Pistols<br />&#34;The Essential Heart&#34; by Heart<br />&#34;Highway To Hell&#34; by AC/DC<br />&#34;Meat Is Murder&#34; by The Smiths<br />&#34;The Strange Case Of...&#34; by Halestorm<br />&#34;Greatest Hits&#34; by Tom Petty<br />&#34;Complete Greatest Hits&#34; by The Cars<br />&#34;Ugly&#34; by Life of Agony<br />&#34;Remain In Light&#34; by Talking Heads<br /><br />As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!<br /><br />I also wish to point out that arguments such as &#34;Oh,but you can HEAR what they're singing!&#34; or &#34;You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!&#34; are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down.

B00899DR40|5.0|I like Justin, I think that he seems to have a great family and faith in Christ. I hope he stays that way. He has great talent
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love this film every time I see it. It is no wonder this film is mentioned in so many of the films and television series made after it's release. Makes me smile every time.
1935670913|1.0|I think I want my money back. Scratch that. I know I want my money back.<br /><br />I bought this book, and then find out by reading a story in the New York Times, dated Aug. 25, 2012, headlined -- The Best Book Reviews Money Can Buy -- that his book sales (the Donovan Creed series and more) were built on a pack of paid-for lies?<br /><br />It seems that John Locke left one important ingredient out of his book \\"How I sold 1 million ebooks in five months.\\" Namely, that he paid for many of his book reviews. Paid book reviews. And he just happens to forget to mention that? Phony as a three-dollar bill.<br /><br />These paid-for reviews help explain, too, why so many of Locke's reviews seem like fake, trashy BS, written by some eighth-grade bubble-gum-popping dingbat. So glowing, they make you sick. Many of them anyway. And that explains, too, why there are so many 1-star reviewers by people asking, \\"How did this author get so many 5-star ratings, when his books basically suck?\\"<br /><br />Now we know. Writers like John Locke who pay for book reviewers are cheaters. They should be drummed out of the Amazon business. They're the same as phony big-name athletes who use steroids. Total phony BS.<br /><br />Shame on you, John Locke.

B00B2V66VS|2.0|I LOVED temple run and there were supposed to be issues with it on Kindle fire that I never experienced. But I loaded Temple2,  played it once and found my eyes had a hard time seeing the path route ahead very well...but I was starting to get used to it. I went back to play again and I can't get paste imangi open screen. Not sure how to get around that...frankly disappointed since I was just getting used to it.  Game was actually great...different enough from Temple1 to make it worth while...if I could play it.

Thank you to Nicholas sparks!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I started the first book out of morbid curiosity I guess you could say.  I wanted to see what all the hype was about.  Read the sample first couple of chapters before buying the first book & was hooked.  I ended up reading all 3 in a very short time.  I will say the writer's style is very redundant.  She uses the same words & phrases repeatedly.  Even the sex scenes get a little monotonous.  I will say, though, the storyline was pretty good & there were some very sweet, touching scenes. I have heard these stories referred to as &#34;Mommy porn&#34; but aside from the explicit parts, it was more a love story & suspense story then &#34;porn&#34;  The books are hard to put down & ya miss the characters when you're done reading.
B0099114WO|5.0|Great acting. A different story. It is pleasant to watch a monie about what could be real life. Laugh,cry, enjoy!!!

B008HJGPVO|5.0|Can't find the right stylus? Look no more. I've gone through at least 10 styluses over the past 2 years and the search is over.  The Amazon Basics Multi-Tip Stylus for Kindle Fire and Touchscreen. it's just right. It has 3 different tips to fit smart phones with smaller keys and a larger tip for tablets. All have a nice rubberized feel so it's not too mushy or to firm. A perfect 5 star rating

This is the music we grew up listening to.  I jumped onto my amazon app from my phone & bought this during the movie.  It was a definite must have for us from that era of music

B003O86FMW|3.0|To be honest, I think the books are lacking in depth. I think the first book in the series is the 'best' one.<br /><br />I think the movie is better than the first book, simply because the book I feel is too simple, and I would rather watch a movie where Jennifer Lawrence's performance is great.<br /><br />The second book is even more bland, there is less character development and it feels as if everything just 'happens' and no hard decisions are made.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Most amazing book!!! Tugs at your heart and will bring tears to your eyes and a smile to your lips

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this game. The only reason I didn't five star it is because the game is kind of confusing at first.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and most of the characters, particularly Miss Mimi and the rest of the Jodie characters. At first I wasn't crazy about the writing, but it was my first Stephen King novel so I'm not sure if this was a good example of his use of language, which was a little overly simple. But I got caught up in the story and had trouble putting it down, and that's what I look for in a good book.<br /><br />The one thing I cannot forgive, and I guess it's a big one because it was a pretty huge part of the story, was the \\"romance.\\" I did not for one moment believe that these two people had any feelings for each other whatsoever. Honestly, the time travel was more realistic. Sadie was completely forgettable and bland, which is annoying bc there were many minor characters who were given a lot more life and color. The narrator repeatedly telling the reader that he loved her just wasn't enough for me to believe it. There was just no spark between them whatsoever. Their romance was just a convenient way to wrap things up a certain way, and a way I didn't much care for.<br /><br />But overall it really was good read and the fact that i breezed through nearly 900 pages in less than a week bumped it from 3 stars to 4.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|For a free game application this version of Mahjong is a true gem. It provides countless hours of solitaire mahjong play with up to 14 boards x 4 categories. Each is timed and can be played again to see if you can beat your own times. I've already spent at least 3 or 4 hours playing this game and I haven't even cleared 10 levels in the first bracket yet. If you love mahjong games you should definitely download this one.

B005HP2J66|3.0|Why Herzog deemed it prudent to film this in 3D is something of a mystery. One supposes he wanted to try and make the paintings, not on flat surfaces, come alive, and maybe they do, in 3D, but in 2D it does nothing. Worse, this film really does nothing. There is nothing essentially Herzogian in it. It's a documentary any filmmaker could do for a cable channel, save for the pointless Postscript to the film, involving albino alligators and mystic mumbo jumbo Herzog finds profound.<br /><br />  The film, at 89 minutes, is probably an hour too long, and while interesting cinematography, by Peter Zeitlinger,, and a nice soundtrack by Ernst Reijseger, enliven the film, they can only do so much. Herzog's narration is not what it is in earlier documentaries of high quality, and one sense the filmmaker gets bored with it all about halfway through the film. Nonetheless, it's a tossup as to which of the two documentaries, here under review is worse. This one is not good, but not bad, merely dull.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Simply put, this was an ode to 50 years of brilliant tradition. But not only was it a love letter, but a superb movie in its own right.
B0035Q4AFC|3.0|Every so often, when I look up the historical critical context of a film, I am surprised by what I find. Most often I see films that are schlock get undue praise, but since most of anything in life is bad (lest we'd not notice the good). This is not unusual. Then there are good or great films that are severely dissed. Almost every Stanley Kubrick film, post-1970, falls into this category. But, then there are films which are nice little films, not particularly bad, but also nowhere near great, that just elicit an off reaction from critics. Such a film is Richard Attenborough's 1992 film, Chaplin, on the life of filmdom's first true superstar. Is it a great film? No. It's a rather standard biopic, and pretty much in line with what the director did, a decade earlier, in Gandhi. Like that film, this one features a previously little known actor who `arrived' via a career-making turn in the title role. In Gandhi it was Ben Kingsley. In Chaplin it is Robert Downey, Jr.<br /><br />  Most of the kvetching revolves around the fact that the film uses a flashback sequence, or that a character played by Anthony Hopkins is fictive, or that the film focuses too much on the personal and sex life of Chaplin. But, let's look at these plaints. First, that a work of art uses a standard technique does not mean that it is trite. It can be trite, or it can be used very effectively. This film splits the difference. It's neither here nor there in that regard. Second, so what that the Hopkins character was not `real'? Again, it's a standard technique, and like the flashback structure, the use of a fictive character is neither here nor there. Third, a biopic could focus on the art of an artist, if the artist was not a film star, to great effect. But, since Chaplin was a film star, the reason the film exists is because everyone knows who he is, in his art. Therefore, only hints of his personal life are fodder for any extrapolation. And the only nudity the film shows is a rear view shot of Milla Jovovich's buttocks, as she portrays Chaplin's first wife, Mildred Harris.<br /><br />  That said, and despite the assorted sex scandals that littered his personal life, Chaplin's personal life was rather dull. The real flaw of the film is that which haunts most biopics, and that is it tries to do the cradle to grave schtick, instead of picking a specific period of the comedian's life, and expounding upon it. One of the best biopics of all time, Patton, follows this method. The DVD, by LionsGate, is the 15th Anniversary Edition. Despite that honorific, the DVD is not top notch. Yes, the film transfer, in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio, is well done, but there is no audio commentary on the disk. This is an alarming trend on many DVDs, especially considering that the costs for producing them has dropped precipitously in the last decade. There are a few bonuses, but they are meager. There's a brief home movie of Chaplin and Paulette Goddard cruising on his yacht off the California coast. There's a featurette on Chaplin's life and career, on eon his life, and also one called The Most Famous Man In The World, on the phenomenon of Chaplin becoming the first truly global superstar. There's also the original theatrical trailer. The box for the DVD mistakenly lists the film's running time at 135 minutes; although it is 144 minutes long.a Jovovich's buttocks, as she portrays Chaplin's first wife, Mildred Harris.<br /><br />  That said, and despite the assorted sex scandals that littered his personal life, Chaplin's personal life was rather dull.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|Mad Men, and its 21st Century drenched characters, is about as relevant to the 1960s as The Sopranos was to the real Mafia. But, that does not mean Mad Men is not compelling, and often excellent, television and fiction. It's simply not high art- although one might argue that its memorable opening credit sequence and lyricless musical score, by David Carbonara, are. Nonetheless, its consistent quality, in artistic and technical merits, makes Mad Men one of the best television shows of this century. And, given the narcissistic, deliterate, and self-absorbed state of this reality television era, that is no small compliment.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|Precious little was golden about the 25 year old Philippe Petit's August 7th, 1974 daredevil tightrope walk between the Twin Towers, 50 years after the death of George Mallory. I recall the day it happened, and for a few weeks afterwards, Petit's name had dwarfed that of the legendary daredevil Evel Knievel's. Then, he was forgotten. But, before the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center and the 2001 9/11 bombings and destruction of the towers, his `coup,' as Petit calls it, was easily the most memorable event in the history of the two ugly towers.<br /><br />  The film goes in to great detail on how meticulously Petit and his cohorts planned the event, as well as earlier escapades at the Notre Dame Cathedral and a bridge in Sydney, Australia. It charts Petit's obsession with the Towers after reading of their building as a teenager. The film draws a reader n to the main event as well as any `hesit' or `caper' film made by Hollywood ever has, and Petit is a fascinating personality, albeit a bit grating. The 94 minute film never makes mention of the events of 9/11 and, on the plus side, this means no restatement of the obvious clich&eacute;s and bathos. On the negative side- and this is likely the lone negative of this otherwise great film, the film misses a golden showcase for us to get a real `in' to Petit's psyche, when he is not clearly mugging for the camera. After all, could anyone have had dearer feelings for those buildings than he?<br /><br />  Nonetheless, the film succeeds on almost all other levels, from some truly inventive cinematography by Michael Nyman, to exquisitely edited footage and photographs by Jinx Godfrey, to J. Raph's and Michael Nyman's wonderful musical scoring; the highlight of which is Erik Satie's Gymnopaedies, especially #3, so skillfully employed in scenes of Petit's actual walk, making this film the third member of a trilogy of great films deploying this signature piece; the others being Woody Allen's Another Woman and Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre. The re-enactments and descriptions of the planning- from fake IDs to the wires to faking invoices to hiding for hours on the top floors of the two towers, then waiting to rig the equipment all up, is fascinating, and Marsh nicely intercuts elements of the training in with the re-enactments so that, by film's end, viewers long familiar with the `coup' will be seeing it with the awe of those people lucky enough to have viewed the actual walk all those decades ago.er With Andre.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|Trite and sophomoric.  Predictable, sorry I wasted my time reading this series.  Should have watched a soap opera instead.....would have had the same results and not cost me a thing!
B0027BOL4G|2.0|The polemical nature of the film sometimes works to the disadvantage of its aims, cinematically and, also dialectically, as there is a whole digression on the finding of E. coli in certain foods which is simply not an issue that has to do with the production of food organically or not, but on the subsequent handling of it, for such can easily occur in organic products, as well as genetically engineered or factory farmed. That the film makes hay of this point, and uses the death of a child to make it, is a bit disingenuous, but the film also deals with the lax regulations that make such outbreaks inevitable, and the outfall from the death, which includes industry attempts to defeat the law, year after year, and disallow government inspections of processing plants (ah, the joys of deregulation!). Contrapuntally, the film also shows a farmer who raises his chickens in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, and slaughters them humanely, and in the open air, only to get slapped by federal authorities with claims that his chickens are unsanitary, whereas processed chickens are dipped in chemical baths- a classic case of the insanity that often accompanies the mix of government and big business into any area, even as the government's inspection of such businesses has decreased by over 80% in the last four decades. The film also details Monsanto's CIA-like attempts to intimidate and extort small farmers into a feudal serfdom via their legal department's patent infringement harassment, as well as `food libel laws,' and the gaming of the system by paying off legislators in many countries to write laws favorable to them.<br />  That stated, Food, Inc. is a classic mixed bag- too long on Left Wing nostra when it should have concentrated on what it did best- feature raw information which is undeniable.

B005LAJ16I|1.0|I had never seen Homeland and a friend highly recommended I watch it. Since Season One was NOT available through my cable provider I purchased Season One on Amazon. Even though I bought a USED disc set (4 discs in season 1) the package arrived in a sealed cellophane wrapper. I had knee replacement surgery on 1/3/2013 and was going to be convalescing at home for several weeks (perfect time to watch 12 hours of programming!). I rapidly viewed the first 9 episodes on the first three discs and was EXTREMELY disappointed to find out that disc #4 was BLANK!!<br /><br />EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING to put it mildly. The program was some of the best television programming I have ever seen, so I was completely disappointed to have an incomplete set of discs. I was going to lend it to friends and neighbors to watch, but it doesn't do much good NOT to be able to finish the series.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I was intrigued about the collector's edition. I used to have a copy of the film on VHS, but now only have a DVD player, and wanted to get the movie again. I have not explored all the features of the collector's edition yet, but I am very satisfied with the DVD copy and the price for which I obtained it.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I have not been a huge fan of Jennifer Lawrence since she was miscast (in my opinion) in the role of Katniss in The Hunger Games. That being said, the acting in this movie is FLAWLESS. The characters are all remarkably believable and I could literally relate to all of them. I left the theater wanting to see what happens next in each of their lives. Even though I laughed out loud several times, I felt it was a serious comedy that truly pulled at your heart strings. I don't often want to see movies over and over again (unless they involve superheroes) and I would willingly go see this again with everyone I know.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|WHAT .... AN .... ALBUM!!!! And totally out of the blue. I was in high school in the 60s when Eric Burdon and the Animals hit the scene. House of the Rising Sun, We Gotta Get Out of This Place, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood. All popular tunes at the high school dances. Then came Winds Of Change which is in my all time top 20 albums. I still have the vinyl, a little scratchy but still as satisfying today as it was then. I am happy for Eric. He deserves this and this album is up there with the great ones. Today's music is terrible compared to the 60s and 70s and early 80s. I look forward to releases by these \\"old timers\\". And River Runs Dry is on my daily play list. The CD is in my car, the MP3s on my computer and Water gets played on my guitar. Simple chords, Am, Em, etc. Eric's still passionate voice makes this a big hit and I congratulate him for sticking to what earned him the greatness he so deserves. GREAT ALBUM!

I am a mother and I think I would defend my children also, but it would also tear me apart to have to go through a situation like in this story. I was disappointed because I never really know if he did it or not. A story that leaves the end up to the reader is not the books I enjoy.

This book talks about nutrition, how to lift the right way, how to stay mentally motivated, and common mistakes made by most people in the gym and in the kitchen. After reading this book, I knew so much about lifting that I now feel like I've been at the gym for ten years. Mike, the author of this book, uses plenty of evidence to support everything that he says. If you want to get bigger, leaner, and stronger (yes, literally bigger, leaner, stronger) you have to read this book.

B009NQKPUW|2.0|The acting was certainly stale. The CGI wasn't what I expected of Ridley Scott. The plot absolutely didn't seem to follow Alien; as a prequel at least. The best acting I saw was from lead actress Rapace and even her performance in this film didn't seem like here. She was definitely not on top of her game in this film, nothing like the Millennium Trilogy where I felt like she really hit her stride. There was little to no character development similar to the &#34;run and gun&#34; feel of a late Rambo movie. The movie had a very &#34;scripted feel for me. This film pales in comparison to Scott's older work. Especially the CGI, the part I expected to be the best, seemed beneath him. There was just way too many plot holes and bad acting for me to enjoy the movie. I'm glad it was free because I would not have been happy spending money to watch this flick.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a fun game but there is a update but it wont let me get it so I cant play with my friends.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was a awesome book!  I could not put it down. Every page something new and exciting was happening. I can not wait to see the movie
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book.  It was intelligently written using both first person narrative and third person story.  The drama was created by creative, realistic and challenging ideas.  Not the usual third-grade mentality that most TV, movies or books try and shove down our throats.  The Protagonist *intelligently* solves the problems and expresses them in a real-world mentality.  I could so easily see myself in the same position, doing the same things, with the same warped sense of humor.  I'm not a NASA scientist, but the problem solving, number crunching and math, as well as the various devices used and the science behind them was refreshing to read about.  It gives would could be a very real reality of life on Mars.  Not a fictional, half-baked idea that lets the reader use their imagination and 'just go with it' for the sake of the story.  The Story itself was the intelligent problem solving to overcome actual challenges.<br /><br />Pirate Ninjas as a unit of energy.... loved that part.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a amazing game that challenges your imagination and gives you something to do with no internet, and nothing to do. I recommend this game for fun
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i love the new layout, the twist and turns, the hills. the mine. it is a lot of fun and i do like it better then the first temple run. con: u can only work one three objectives at a time and they r the one that thay choose.
0765325950|5.0|Kudos Robert and Brandon!!  I didn't know how you were going to wrap things up when so much seemed up in the air at the end of the last book, but you did it masterfully!<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone who loves the Wheel of Time series, but what would be the point?  You all already have it, don't you!?
B0063IH60K|5.0|It works great. I haven't had any issues with the app. However, I have only used it for about a month.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Fun and very addicting some glitches...  play it everyday.  Would like more options with the missions.  Fun game for any age good family fun
B000MRAAJM|5.0|watching this on my new panasonic PC65VT50, some of the scenes have some much details, that they litterally looks 3D.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|It didn't change my life. I was under the impression this bad boy was going to cut angles off of wine bottles, beer bottles, etc.<br /><br />I would like to think my skills have improved since purchasing it, yet I have yet been able to get a solid line on anything I cut. I really have to work on smoothing it out to look acceptable. It's meh.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|they say it`s free, but if you have played G5 games before, then you know that &quot;free&quot; only gives you a taste.  $2.99 and you get full version.  abyss wasn't too hard, i enjoyed it, except not enough hidden object games.
0988262592|5.0|I've been an operations professional for about 20 years, and currently lead a DevOps team spanning development, QA, security, and operations disciplines. I definitely went through my BOFH stage, have plenty of waterfall projects under my belt. But I've been on a path that was part intuitive, part of being aware of what was going on in the operations fringe of the Agile community. Of course, now they have this cool buzzword \\"DevOps\\" but until now the literature that directly addresses this movement has been sparse and in many cases misinformative.<br /><br />So this (not really) fictional story is really more of a case study in turning a disastrous traditional IT shop, a dreaded cost center, into a a tightly integrated community of teams that acts as a force multiplier for the business. I'm very much working on a transformative process like this now for my current employer, and this book has proven to be a very timely source of inspiration.<br /><br />One thing is for sure: I've been highlighting as I go, and my highlights are going to translate into direct action on my real world DevOps team. I already got some great ideas for improving my Kanbans and gaining more insight into my constraints and what to do with/about them.
0142421375|1.0|I was a fanatic of JOhn Grishams books, BUT This book is the most boring I have ever read of this author. No drama;just from the begining I was not interested in continuing reading although I did in the hope that it was going to improve.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love Minecraft but update it I hate it when my friends have a iPod and have the update I want the UPDATE
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app is good but you have to buy the full version to play your own music come on guys
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Some of the characters are hard to differentiate from each other.<br />It is still a good game. I LIKE the way the new game reforms to finish out the last few pieces.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It's a little different from other Grishan books, but I enjoyed it.<br />Like I said earlier I think it is a good read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is amazing. I bought temple run 1 and loved that game. When I heard about temple run 2 I immediately downloaded the game. I also think that this puts the first temple run to shame. The graphics are way better. The game is much more relaxing now also. I highly recommend you get this app!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Nice and clean, provides the data without being in your face. Haven't done any calibration with it and never far from power so it is all i need
B000BPFBVW|5.0|This album is good, the surround sound edition by Monster Music is an experience you don't want to miss. Sinners Prayer with BB King will touch you.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|Great! This cd came quickly and in great shape. I couldn't have gotten any better buying it at a music store.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I purchased this game for my 7 year old grandson.  But I must admit once he showed me how to play, I was hooked.  We share a lot of laughs playing this game.  I only have him every other weekend and I must admit, I have been playing this game at nights.  lol  Showed it to some co-workers and now they have it on their Kindle.  Fun game!
B0028KF4M4|4.0|The season ads new characters and the twists keep you coming back for more. You are attached to the characters you've come to know and love - or despise.
B000SXMNI6|5.0|I had to donate the vinyl version of this album last week and was heartbroken to do so.  I downloaded the MP3 version of this record and was again blown away by the sheer power this record delivers.  If I was exiled to a desert island and was told I could only have 10 records this would be one of them.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I got this tripod to take videos with my samsung galaxy S2. It works well, just a little tight and you can't slide it snugly to the side piece or else it hits your volume buttons.
B000T1JJFC|5.0|My wife wanted me to go through all my old vinyl records and sell/donate the ones I did not want to keep anymore.  So many were in real rough shape including &#34;Benefit&#34; by Jethro Tull.  I bid farewell to the scratched vinyl disc and downloaded this album<br />onto my computer and loved it!  It was like hearing it for the first time all over again!  Jethro Tull was way ahead of its time when this record was done.  It blends rock and the jazziness of Ian Anderson's flute wonderfully.  I have been enjoying the earworms of this record for a week now.
0553584537|5.0|Good Book. hate that you have to use so many words to rate on this website. Kind of crazy. Ugh.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is one of my favourite books of all time. I love emo and the point of view the story is written. I strongly recommend this book to any and all dog lovers!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game. Time flies when you play this game....it is very addictive! I highly recommend this game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's very fun. I love to do the objectives. I like scarlet Fox the best. I really recommend this game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Honestly I have no idea why some people say it doesn't work on android. Please don't listen to the  reviews that say that it is bad on android trust me.  Anyway Minecraft is so awesome!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|Baldacci just keeps getting better with every book.  I hope he writes more starring John Puller and his entertaining investigations.
B004LROMX4|5.0|I gave 5 stars for this first season of, well, surprise. Yeah, sure, graphics are 10/10, but geez, for a tv show, they're not bad. The story continues with each new episode with small stories within each new episode.<br /><br />Many tv shows have a small story with BIG stories that start new each episode. Since Falling Skies doesn't do that, I gave it 5/5. I'd rather the story continue at a good pace than slow as the writers bore us with new individual story lines each new episode.<br /><br />Definitely worth a watch if you like end of world and science fiction events. Waiting for the BluRay version of Season 2! :)
B00873GRU4|5.0|This book is great- it immediately takes you to a different world. Every new page gets better and better! I finished this book in no time! Can't wait for third shift to be available on kindle.
0765325950|4.0|This book was unlike any of the previous books. Action after action after action. I'm so used to having to wait for the end of a Robert Jordan book to get a very descriptive, action packed event. Sanderson did an excellent job with giving me what I wanted out of the last battle. The entire book is one massive war. Matt and Rand, my two favorite characters, finally got more book time compared to previous books and they didn't disappoint me--until the end, that is.<br /><br />For all the descriptive details that Jordan and Sanderson usually put into WoT, I was very disappointed with the end. It was a quick ending to such a long series. More questions were left when I thought the story would be completely finished. Its a peeve of mine when the author doesn't complete the story and lets you decide what happens to the character. I want finality!<br /><br />Overall, I finished the book with a &#34;sense&#34; of completion. I can stop paying money and waiting out the release of yet another book. :)
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After reading this book I was left wondering what happened next At least , after reading the first four books, I knew that there was more to come..
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Hard to get into. The ending was a surprise that I couldn't see coming until the last few pages. I enjoy his style.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the perfect &quot;part two&quot; to temple run it has more in store including gems extra lives mines and zip lines it is so much fun and it's free! So you can't go wrong with that. I HIGHLY recommend getting this app it is perfect. Thinking back on it I would gladly pay 1.99 for this so you are DEFINITELY getting a deal. If you liked temple run you will LOVE this!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|With this album, the chatter and false starts are removed.  No more Maggie Mae or Dig It.  Different track order.  The Long and Winding Road has no orchestra like the original.  I like the original better.  However, I don't think I'll ever listen to all of Let It Be (album) after hearing this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun, I wish it was not as hard to get coins though.<br />But for for the most part this is a awesome app and everyone should have it.
B0000029LG|5.0|Here it is.  I think they did a good job picking out almost 80 minutes of music.  If I had to fill up 90 minutes I would have included &#34;Smooth Criminal.&#34;  It contains music from Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, but nothing before Off the Wall.  It's a good introduction to MJ music for new fans.  And disc2 has new material.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Just put the word and the definition please yes i am saying to rewrite the books thank you very much
B006BG7RI0|5.0|Great movie. One that you can watch over and over again.This is a real collector for movie buffs like me
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are the best books I have ever read I wish they were more of them  I can't wait for the movies
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is more fun than the first which I did not think possible. Love it ... A little buggy but I am sure they will take care of that
0765325950|5.0|what a great ending to a great series..Jordon truly is the king of fantasy. All 14 books were wonderfull, his characters are so real..
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Old-fashioned down to earth movie with a good storyline and excellent performance by Eastwood.<br />Both the wife and I enjoyed the movie, which is a rarity.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|The writers didn't disappoint when setting up the plotlines to this season of Castle!  Witty dialogue and great chemistry on the part of the cast makes this a wonderful viewing experience!  Totally enjoying my purchase and would heartily recommend!!
B005H9B44A|5.0|I like chris hemsworth and natalie portman. I also like the sci fi mixed with adventure and romance.. This was  a great moview
B005O7PXNS|5.0|The story development in the Castle series is a credit to the talents of the writing staff.  A few key plotlines resurface annually and this season is no exception.  The relationship between Castle and Beckett deepens while the murder investigations take center stage.  Great stories!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, i love the graphics, just love the game,its a really fun game,i think everyone will like it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome, fast paced, creatively written wonderful read, page turner.  Great words near the end The things that knock you down in life are tests, ....I'm choosing to stand taller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf as it was a very fun and my family love top play it and we have a competition to see who can get the highest score.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Take the time to enjoy the concept of time in our lives. Time well spent.  A fun well written read
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fun, interesting game where you run around trying to unlock new characters and items. The location changes every month giving a new spin on the idea.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|THe books starts kind of slow. All the talk about Zookeeping didn't raise too much interest on me. The &#34;real&#34; action starts when the family decides to move to Canada. The long strain after the ship sunk is beautifully described and keeps you glued to the book.<br /><br />I hope the movie doesn't disappoint me.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|Great Photo Editing , It's Very Helpful In Many Ways I Use It Almost Everyday. The Effects Are Awesome ! I Love Everything About PicsArt , You Got My Rate a 5 !
B005LAIH2W|5.0|For those of you going in to this movie simply to be entertained, this movie was fantastic!  I had read the book(s) beforehand and wondered how they would pull it off, and I think they did an excellent job.  The special effects are awesome!  (For those critics who came out saying it was a flop, how wrong you are.  I would LOVE to see a sequel to this movie!)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read . Kept me interested and I read it in a very short time . I would read more from this author .
B003VANOFY|5.0|Great sound mic works amazing wide range do not get tired of using it no matter how long . .
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWSOME 0.6.0 is awsome on my kindle fire best game I have ever played in like my whole life ps love the clouds
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It was very life like and it was fun to brush the horses!  My 9 year old granddaughter really likes it!
B004J88SGC|5.0|This is by far one of the best videos of a concert ever produced. The only one that I have seen that comes close is Pink Floyd  &#34;Pulse&#34; - The price was right - the service was great!
B000H6FHLY|5.0|it`s very realist piece for horse lovers i liuke very much  big details and relistic piece<br />i will buy others kinds
B00B2V66VS|2.0|temple run keeps taking my coins and it put a virus on my kindle fire it sucks rotten eggs horrible game
B00APUYWYA|5.0|loved almost everything about this comedy<br />you may ask why almost everything the  vomiting scenes are a little excessive<br />other than than that<br />its a good movie about a girl learning to reach out to other  and become friends
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I throughly enjoyed this movie! Any one who enjoys miyazaki films will probably enjoy summer wars. This kept me on the edge of my seat and i recommend it to anyone who enjoyes animated films!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|get this game its great and can occupy you for weeks the only thing I don't like is how sometimes it will put hints in front if obstacles
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I thought this was a great movie when it first came out in theaters, but I like it even more after watching it a few time.  Ryan Phillipe does an amazing job in this role...totally believable as an innocent guy who is framed.
B000069KE0|5.0|The album mny older brother usedvto play Before school, with his old Fisher speakers, that had 15-inch woofers, that made stuff slide off of MY closet shelf!
B005PK553C|5.0|I missed one show and needed to see it. It's a great show for the first season. The 2nd season is not! Very weird fetishes in the 2nd season. The first season is a must-see. It's easy to deliver to your ipad or other device. Amazon makes it user-friendly.
B00007LTIL|5.0|HEY----What can you say to one of of my 3 fav dead albums?  Box of Rain Sugar Magnolia,  wit 5 live traCKS AT THE END!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!  Always wanted a pet horse. When I was little I always wanted a pet horse but now that I have one on the game I don't want the responsabilty of a horse.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is awesome for the most part. But I reached a certain point in the game where I couldn't finish or win a competition. I looked online and other people had that problem as well. It would be a definite five star review if not for that one flaw. Aside from that, it's very fun and easy to play. :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game is fun. You take care of a horse and compete in championships. Good time waster...I'm playing in my KF though and cant get the dang thing to open 75% of the time...frusterating
1439102430|2.0|This is the last Kathy Reichs book I will read. And that is sad, seeing as I was so gung-ho over the series right from the beginning. But the series has gone from really cool forensic anthropology cases to self-absorbed Tempe --hot career, hot looks, hot brains, hot boyfriend - then ex-boyfriend, and now two exes -- while the actual forensic science has gone out the window. I really don't care about Tempe's problematic love life except to say it's her obnoxious personality that drives 'em away. I do care about the fascinating details that make these cases, and now they are gone.<br /><br />Ditto any writing skill the author once had.  Maybe it's the influence of writing screenplays, but the last few books have gone to a terse, choppy and needlessly snarky style with way too many one-sentence paragraphs, all of which is a turn-off and annoying in the extreme. Not to mention that the last few books, as others have pointed out, are all the same tedious formula and only the titles have changed (***Spoiler alert ONLY if you have never read one of the more recent books):<br /><br />Gorgeous Genius Scientist gets Shocking Case. GG Scientist has (Ex)Boyfriend problems. Then other Ex problems. Catty dialogue between characters as Shocking Case gets more intense. GG Scientist travels all over hell and back with Ex(es) on case, sniping all the way, though it makes no procedural sense whatsoever. Lots of meandering and unnecessary descriptions of people, places and things in order to fill out a thin plot. GG Scientist runs afoul of Bad Guys, gets kidnapped while simultaneously solving case, and is rescued. No romantic resolution (but who cares, as the Exes are jerks). The End.<br /><br />As Reichs says far too often in this book, You get the picture.<br /><br />I agree with those who think Reichs is spread way too thin between her books and TV screenplays. Just don't get me started on that dreadful TV show, which is only worth watching for the eye candy of the male lead.
B00991TCOG|5.0|As long as you know what to expect, this cd is amazing. Its trance/dubstep + a great violinist. I wish there were more cd's like this out there.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This works alright for the fire, though there are a few problems. As others have said, it only loads the first ten posts, then will not load  the rest. Another problem with this app is that when you hit the install button on the Facebook messenger, it doesn't take you to a different page. You stay on the Same page and nothing happens. I can't get it to work at all, I and by doing so I am not able to see if anyone is on and have not  been able to find out how. Refreshing the page seems to have no effect. If this could be fixed so I can talk to my friends that would be great.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I am over 70 and am having so much fun with this game.  Great graphics and dialog.  I think almost everyone would enjoy this adventure.
B000FC146C|5.0|The Thorn Birds is a wonderful, rich story.  I have read it several times and it always draws me back in.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|game is awesome and fun to play till you stop and then try to play again game dose not load past the game creator's screen.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book.  One of Mitch Albom's best.  I'd recommend it to anyone.  Really makes the reader think about the concept of time.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This was an interesting read. Being a mother it hit home on many levels. I went from loving Ma to not being so sure about her. I wish that the book had continued to know how it all turned out. I havent been able to get the book out of my head for days. I enjoyed it, hope you will too.
0307341550|5.0|guess all I can do is list adjectives: unsettling, dark, thrilling, sad, discomforting.. Glad I dont live in this authors mind, but I loved every minute visiting it! WOW.......
B009UX2YAC|2.0|It\\"s ok but can\\"t beat temple run 2.y'all should make it like where you candrive a car or where at one point your underwater.
030758836X|5.0|Again WOW...and I mean WOW! I'm so glad I dont have Gillian Flynn's mind, but to read her stories and visit her thoughts is both compelling and scary! This is my 2nd novel by her...waiting to open dark places but I need some mental space. I'm just amazed.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is magnificent. The only reason I use that adjective is because a more apt description does not exist in the tongues of man but rather in extremely excited shrieks and wild and-gestures that can only be adequately followed by the source of this delighted flailing chucking a copy of this book at your face. I intend to buy several copies, purely for chucking purposes as it is my intent to make everyone around me experience the joy and rapture of this book. I suggest that you read it and then follow suit in the book-chucking literary evangelism that this book deserves.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It keeps you on your toes.  You have to be very alert. It has some special features on the screen
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It was really fun to start but now i cant open it anymore on my kindle fire and it was may favorite game. :(
0446554995|2.0|I've faithfully followed the Pendergast series, which is why there are so many aspects of this story that do not make any sense.  It felt as though the authors rushed through the plot and just settled on whatever.  There's a shocking tragedy that occurs almost immediately at the beginning but Pendergast's response is totally uncharactertistic with past novels.  Also, the relationship between Pendergast and D'Agosta, his best friend, partner, with countless life and death experiences, took an inexplicable twist.  All of the sudden D'Agost doesn't trust Pendergast and then backstabs him.  If you follow the series the relationship and loyalty is unquestioned; until now.  The technical aspects, regarding crime investigation, omitted information to keep you guessing, however, it does not take a seasoned detective to see all the open holes in the investigation that would never happen in the real world.  If I enjoy a book I simply take my time reading, but I felt myself rushing through this novel just to get it over with.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|What more can be said? She is an extremely talented woman and this CD offers many of my favorite songs, as well as some new favorites I discovered on it.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|His smooth vocals, awesome band this Albums is AMAZING..... I want an opportunity to see him live.<br />This is a must have!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|It helped me understand the war from the German point of view. I had five brothers who served in that war and yet they did not talk much about it. They just wanted to forget the difficult times that it created. I have a new appreciation for men in the service.
B004ITFWJI|5.0|Epic tale of an unnamed hero who does eveything within his wisdom (and martial skills) to bring balance to the kingdom... The story is well asembled as a tale with twists and turns that make you think who's the villain and who's the hero many times.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love using Kindle for Android on my tablet it is great for reading all my books.  Keep up the good work.
B0051XQI84|5.0|That movie rocks! an unlikely character from an unlikely father wants to be a kung fu master without having the means to... great lessons of life (or just plain fun :)))
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My husband and I needed something to chill out to on a work night, and this did the trick.  We had so much fun watching it.  A classic romantic comedy (there aren't many good ones these days) mixed with references to the '80s.  All the female characters were quirky yet exuded confidence.  Definitely entertaining.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's great for a challenge. At times it's easy but then the next one will not be done in time. So it will want you to do more and figure it out.
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|Great concept, horrible lag and crash issues. I don't suggest paying. Rather you should try the light version and see if it preforms for you.
0393976041|4.0|I am really enjoying this book even though it is takinga littles longer due to the 'language of the time'.  The only rotten thing about it was it took about 5 weeks to get.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|The only problem I have with this is the stand is rather weak and is stuborn to make work but everything else is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game. Very fast-paced and entertaining..helps in developing fine motor skills..love it. Challenging and my grandchildren enjoy it too. I didn't think at my age I would like it but I do. I think it will keep the dementia at bay lol.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun game but it does not always open. also it would be nice if it were easier to earn gems.
B004I744AS|1.0|this is the worst dictionary in the world it sucks it doesn't even have synonyms or a thesaurus dont get it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This very pleasing journey back in in time is such a delight to totally immerse yourself within.<br /><br />This series ranks second to any other TV series I have ever committed to follow.<br /><br />Very Well thought out dynamics and very well written.  The actors that were chosen are perfect for their respective roles.<br /><br />Once you begin you won't want it to ever end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Addicting, challenging and a nice diversion from the everyday doldrums! Take the challenge and enjoy, have fun! A nice change in puzzles!
0385535147|5.0|As usual, John Grisham is an excellent story teller.  I have read all he has written and have enjoyed each book and look forward to his next book.
1616550414|5.0|This tome is amazing. Full color concept art of every LoZ game, A timeline and the timeline explained, as well as the plot of each game, and neat bits of information about how things evolved, how the art was chosen, and a variety of rejected drawings, also full color. This is so worth it for any Legend of Zelda fan. It is beautiful, high quality work that deserves to be seen by everyone!
6304697961|5.0|got this on DVD because it was time to upgrade on my Halloween Got this at good price. you should check this Classic horror movie out.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this app it is really fun but after a few times of playing it I try to open it and after showing the imangi studios symbol it exits me out of the app.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nice Horror Movie check it out it worth the buy for a good price on here :) i just love it.
B004JOCU2O|3.0|I have not yet received the movie. I'll be happy to write a review after I've received the movie.  Thanks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game knows what you want to do with just a tap of your finger. Works quite well.  Good job
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Loved this game at first. Played several games and had even won some upgrades.On one of the games I tried after Ihad played a few games with the upgrade it refused to open up anymore. Only the image that always would appear whenever you clicked on the games icon on the apps page. Can't recommend at this time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Everyone needs access to a basic calculator.  Calculator plus fills the bill very nicely.  It works well and has nice big numerals for aging eyes.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|I was a little surprised to see this come in a padded envelope. It's not terribly big, but it makes up for that in details. The textures are amazing, and the paint job is top notch. It's probably best for collecting or decoration, but my little girls love it as a toy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It will not open no matter what. It only opened the first couple of times. As in 1 or 2 times. I tried deleting it and then putting it back on but that didn't work. I'm deleting it for good if I cant find something that works. Any ideas?
B005UDD1R6|5.0|This is the media player I got so my son could have easy access to his music on his micro SD card. I installed it and it worked perfectly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Reads the title amazingly perfect for the graphics and add on. Download for sure I'm glad I have this cause the first one was getting old
030759565X|5.0|I read the Smitten blog every once in a while since I hear good things about it all the time.  I live in my kitchen so I go there regularly to get ideas/inspirations.<br />So when I saw Deb's book at the library I immediately snatched it up.  I browsed through it when I got home and immediately got on amazon to order.  I knew this was a keeper.<br /><br />I love her little stories and more importantly love her recipes. They're not super hard and perfect for people passionate about their food.<br /><br />Of course there will be people who will just go to the blog for recipes but I'm an old fashioned girl who loves her cookbooks and recipe cards.<br />Really enjoying this one.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This game does not have random deals.  Random means random!  Not 80% dead ends  I have played other alligator games, and believe me, there are mot this many random DEAD ENDS.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Funny and cute - makes my inner choir nerd sing!<br />I've never been one for show choirs, but this movie made me live my old high school memories of madrigal choir &#60;3
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Nice puzzle game lots of fun to play. I have trouble putting it down. Would buy again and may more from the same company.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Frankl's experiences and the wisdom he gained from them changed the way I see life and the world, at first reading, several decades ago.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The characters on Suits are absolutely fantastic! The chemistry between Harvey and Mike has definitely matured but the writers put enough humor into the script that it doesn't hinder their relationship.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Overall a funny movie, but did have a few just silly and stupid moments that did not work for me.
B006PE6VW6|5.0|OMG! Anna Faris' character cracks me up and reminds me of myself! This is a romantic comedy that I actually enjoy and is certainly more realistic than something like the Wedding Planner.
B00AZV7TCG|1.0|What is the deal with this show???!!! Why do people think it is clever/funny/entertaining?? The Big Bang Theory is far and away the worst sitcom I have ever seen. I can't believe people actually like this dogs***. I can barely sit through an episode without falling asleep or changing the channel out of frustration of how awful of a show it is. Want to watch something funny? Try Curb Your Enthusiasm or Peep Show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm addicted to this game!!! ive been trying to get it on my kindle fire forever and now I cant get ENOUGH!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app it's addicting and fun I can never put my phone down. I totally recommend this to everyone.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Hotel Transylvania , was a great movie , well written and entertaining .  I enjoyed the premise of the movie about monsters being afraid of humans .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Thought this would be just another romance novel but I was pleasantly surprised with all the twists and turns. Definitely worth the read I loved it!!

B007SSEU9O|1.0|The movie was slow and boring , no real plot to the movie , love Meryl Streep as an actor,
B009C7JS14|5.0|Every time I go on it, it comes up without any lag time. I provides everything I'm looking for. Simple, check the weather& move on.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game! It gets hard wich sux . . . H h h vhvxf fyasg gfy x.x. ry,xrx ff
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was a great ending to the hunger games trilogy and I recommend the series to anyone. Loved it
1427210241|5.0|Great book.  No wonder it tool so long to complete with all the details in the final book.<br />Keeps you interested from the first CD.  The readers do an excellent job with the characters<br />and you can almost visualize the whole story.  Thanks
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick nailed it with the Kane Chronicals now ive already completed this series (which was awsome) percy jackson series and currently in the middle of the heroes of olympus waiting for book 4 of the series The House Of Hades. completely amazing.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|great product
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game it is great for all ages.The strategy helps you improve your hand eye coordination. I have recommended this game to my friends.
B0055DNH0C|5.0|Just makes me want to Zumba all day, can't stop shaking my booty!!! Love Pitt and glad Amazon lets you share with other devices.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I'm addicted...Martin writes in such a way that you feel connected with the characters...so much better than the television series
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Good product and really is a help in finding wifi ! I would suggest this program to anyone who moves around in your day !
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Trying to totally annihilate the entire world. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd never in a million years really want this to happen but to be able to take different types of bacteria and viruses along with symptoms and abilities and make something that ends up wiping out the entire world...well it don't get no better than that :)<br /><br />It's actually kind of interesting to watch how your changes and mutations cause different effects and also watch how it sometimes mutates itself without any help from you.<br /><br />If you like to read about these types of end of the world scenarios, I'd give this little gem of a game a go before the price goes up above .99 cents! Awesome game at an awesome price.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this thing !  Wakes me up every morning. Easy to set and can be set for different times on different days for those of us with crazy schedules and inconsistencies .  Wish it had a few more ringer choices , but that may just take a bit more explring on my part.  Have been using it for just a few weeks and havn't taken that much time to go into depth searching for options. Producct functions great and is very reliable.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I fought reading this book thinking it would be similiar to a John Grisham novel.  It's much more of a psychological thriller that always asks the question, &#34;what would you do? who would you believe?&#34;  Have been recommending it to all my friends.  Thank you Mr. Landay for a great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok this game is the best thing in the world! The characters take a little time to buy but it is well worth it!  This game is awesome.<br /><br />  From the best player in the world
0385737955|4.0|This was one of those books that grabbed my attention and kept it throughout the book.  I found that I was reading it every chance I got, even at inopportune times.  The main character, Thomas, kept me intrigued and continually guessing what was going to happen next.  Although I knew that he and Teresa would hook up, it was still interesting and kept the reader guessing in a lot of areas.  This book was written for a much younger audience, but the way the plot was written was and the characters were developed, it can keep the attention of readers of all ages.  I enjoyed the book enough that I immediately purchased the second book, which looks like it is going to be just as good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games ever got a high score of 776,823 it is so much gunplay it every day all the time
0920668372|5.0|My son is in prison so this book really says it like I feel it. I wish I had had this book 41 years ago!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Love all the new features, but had to turn graphics down to lowest setting for my Kindle Fire to perform. Also had several crashes, at one point had -1 emeralds. Maybe an update will address stability.<br /><br />(Update) Crashes on 'Save Me' about 25% of the time, very frustrating.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|I know Jane Austen was a famous author but this book was written 200 years ago. I couldn't understand a lot of what was being said. Language was too old. I found it to be very boring and empty. Plot?? What plot??
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The second generation of temple run is great, especially the much improved artworks, the map is full of adventure, worth to recommand.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I think this book was a wonderful enchanting book with lots of magical fun.it was happy and scary at the same time. I would definitely read it again. The wonderful wizard of oz is truly wonderful and very different in a good way.
B007BZM3HK|1.0|I don't know what all the craziness was all about, but I hated this song. She will be a one hit wonder.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|The game freezes periodically, and the only way to continue is to shut my Kindle Fire down.  After turning it back on, the game can be continued or canceled.  The only way to shut the music off is to pause the game - the pause screen has the shut off symbols. The scores cannot be reset.  By removing the game from the device, it can be reloaded to reset scores.<br /><br />These problems being said, I do enjoy playing. I just would enjoy it more without the problems.
B0071PS7AC|1.0|Very stupid game, and the quality was terrible. I will never play it again, and have deleted it . IT SUCKED!!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|and it took a long time to load on my kindle fire. you would expect little tweeks but they changed a lot of things.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I bought this album sort of on a whim. I've always respected Jack White, but never have gotten fully into all of his stuff because some of it can be very unique/off-the-wall. I knew a few songs on here and figured his partnership with Brendon Benson would make a nice starter album to begin getting into his stuff. When I got it, I couldn't believe how great is was! It has a little bit of everything and it's all awesome. I purchased Broken Boy Soldiers after this album and enjoyed it, but I prefer Consolers of the Lonely more. I highly recommend buying this album and especially the vinyl, if you can get it.
B008476HBM|1.0|Amazon.com is amazing, so I'm not giving it one star because I hate Amazon.com because I don't. But I found Pride and Prejudice extremely boring but maybe that's just me. It was just so hard for me to read I like almost died it's so exasperatingly long and sooooooooooooooooooooo boring!!!!!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I need to reread parts of it, but it's simplest idea is that it's not what happens to you that matters but how you choose to react.  You can still be generous and helpful, if only in your intentions.  You can be honorable. To me this means that we who live in freedom have much more ability and responsibility to put into action our principles.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Marvelously written psychological thriller.  Couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  She has the soul of a poet....or a Poe.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I could not even view this product due to the fact it skipped and stalled throughout the whole work out!!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Along with the rest of the world I am eagerly awaiting the next book!<br />It was great to highlight some of the older characters.  Hoping for a great Arya portion next time
B00992CF6W|5.0|don't know how to update thought<br />get it worth the money needs armour and read stone and rail road tracks
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|At first I thought this story was going to be about a double suicide, then it changes completely. This is a story about beautiful, inseparable love and it gave me a whole new perspective on suicide. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B0042IQDVG|4.0|Love the older music and no one else could sing them like Rod. Love this and listen to it almost daily.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because.  Its so realistic yet very fun.everyone should get this game.subway surfers is my favorite game ever.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|It's Led Zeppelin... What more needs to be said? Album was recorded live at the O2 Arena in 2007, and Jason Bonham does an amazing job filling in the shoes of his late, great dad. Well worth the purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the most epic game ever!!!! Too bad it doesn't update but it's still so awesome<br />Awesome<br />Minecraft<br />Epic<br />Get it now
B000025FRS|5.0|This is a great classic album that brings back memories from me teen years.  I had it on tape but now I've upgraded to CD.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Great flick!  Awesome acting except for Bale's accent.  Oh well.  Terrific plot, neat costumes and wonderfully imaginable cinematography.  Fun times!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It it a good game but nothing fantastic. I almost never get minecarts or any of that crap. I wish they had actually made the game play more interesting or different.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I looooooooo oooo io o oo o o o o o oo oo o o o oo ove it sjshshzjshsh sjbsjzbsh hxbshsh
0811879542|5.0|This book is both funny and cute.  It was for a young disabled girl to get some smiles while reading a book.  It worked
1452110581|5.0|As a life -long owner of cats, I have bought and been gifted with many cat-related books,  This one is one of the best.  Francesco Marciuliano must have spent a lot of time with cats to understand them so well.  I have a cat who is the poster child for the title poem, so I had to have it.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I specifically bought this portable charger because it has dual outputs (1 AMP and 2 AMP).<br />The wife and I both have the iPhone 5 and she has the latest iPad so this can charge any of our devices AND is very portable.<br /><br />This came in handy when the wife and I had to wait for several hours. We were able to surf and charge our iPhones.<br /><br />There are other higher capacity chargers but this fit the bill for us.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is such fun and addictive I love playing it so do my children, we have competitions between us, it's fun for all ages even my father loves it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun. Something to do when you have nothing to do and are travelling on anything. So fun fun fun. So play.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Hey, there's not much more to say.  It's wonderful seeing them perform.  I missed a concert in New Orleans back when Robert Plant's son died and never got the chance to see them again, so this was a long awaited experience for me.  Anyone who loves Zepplin will enjoy this concert.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun. You don't have to buy any extra stuff to enjoy the game. Love the world tour and how the game changes so you don't get tired of seeing the same stuff. Get the game and have some fun.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cover fits pretty snug on the kindle, and has nice coverage. I bought these for my kids, and so far they are doing a good job protecting the kindles. They are grippy and i like how the elastic strap holds the cover on the screen.
0425263916|5.0|This book was a Great price. I am now hooked on Sylvia Day! I cannot wait until the next one comes out!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I was surprised at how addictive this game is. I highly recommended trying this one, be prepared for spending lots of time playing this one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love to play this game.  This game keep you on edge to play it.  My hundsand loves to help me play it too.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Enjoyed<br />I enjoyed it so much I plan on buying it, It is a story that keeps you coming back for more!!!
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like this okay.  I do not like that it takes so many bingo credits to purchase the cards. i do not like the fact I click on something to play on the game and it takes all of my bingo credits.  I am still learning the game. The game is Bingo Blitz
B003IWYOF4|5.0|Calling it Hughes' finest is highly subjective, but it's amazing that this film has stood the test of time like it has.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I am so impressed with my new radio access. I get great reception and in these mountains - I usually can't get any radio at all. This TuneIn Radio has improved my life - so many stations to choose from and they are clear and un-interrupted. Hooray!
B00005N6KG|4.0|Was looking for a cheaper, yet high quality pair of headphones. These fit the bill just perfectly. Ordered two pair and am pretty happy with them for keeping in the gym bag for those times when I forget my better suited wraparound headphones for the working out.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are prone to wiggling out, though that's to be expected when there is nothing clipping it to your ear.
0937381888|5.0|I became interested in home brewing beer several years ago. Palmer's &#34;How To Brew&#34; is now indispensable every time I make a batch. The instructions are simple and thorough. There are basic explanations for a primary extract brewer as myself. There are more in depth instructions for more advanced all-grain brewers as well.<br /><br />This is not the be-all and end-all of home brewing texts. This is an excellent starting point for anyone even remotely interesting in this fine craft.
B0076DELIG|4.0|The expected Harry complications and twists, with an interesting plot twist with the active participation of his daughter. A great rainy weekend novel.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Totally the best book so far. I had such a hard time putting it down!I can't wait to read the next book!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is the kind of book that will take you fully and transfer you in different universe, in different time and place. And when you put it down you not going to believe that you don't live in a castle and don't ride a horse in this very moment.<br />This is also very honest book, witch don't give you a happy sparkling kings and queens without any flaws. I like author's ability to give all of his characters good sides and bed sides.<br />In the end I want to recommend this book highly to everyone, even if you never found yourself interested in historical fantasy before.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is intriguing, intense and thought-provoking....love it! Claire Danes is amazing. I am looking forward to watching the rest of the season.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like it. It's so good. Miami loves it. She's good and she's like on level 6. &amp; has 10 dragons.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|For me the original Resident Evil movie is still the best, but this is definitely my favorite one of the subsequent movies. Very entertaining with some surprising twists.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best app ever. I reccomend to anyone but it may be frustrating sometimes but this app is awesome. hope this helped. ;)
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was raw, intense!  I did enjoy it!  I will continue to  read the rest of them  when I find them! Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome I am so addicted and so is my mom temple run is a cheap version of this get subway surfers not temple run!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Caught up on all 3 seasons and they are great !! Cannot wait for Sunday night.  A new favorite for me.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|this movie was just weird to me...the talking bear smokes, drinks, and has sex with women, idk, I like Mark Wahlberg. But this movie was very strange, and tried way to hard to be funny and shocking. Not my kind of humor...it was the same crass humor as family guy, so if you like that show, you may enjoy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love his game I wish I could play it all day long it is the best game in the whole wide world
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I found it to be pretty unbelievable. Same old drug dealer / kingpin war over turf type story Except that they tried to turn pot into cocaine...it just didn't really gel very well and the female lead was somewhat pathetic...not likeable at all. It was just sort of uncomfortable to watch al the bad acting. Even Salma Hayak, who I like, did not really fit the role. I would wait until it comes out on streaming.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game and give it five out of five I love  it because you get to know what horses like to eat and how to look after them
B004U8VWLE|2.0|this movie to me was bizarre and creepy...a lot of what was going on didn't really make sense, the girl was delusional, I couldn't tell what was real and what was in her imagination sometimes at first. The ending was strange didn't really tie things up. I felt like I  wasted money by renting this.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game just starts right out fast paced and doesn't let up. This is also one of the few games that plays better on my phone (SGS2) than on either of my tablets. I took off a star because sometimes controls don't respond well.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It was a pretty good movie! very violent, a ton of guns and shootout scenes. Good story line, it was entertaining and I enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book as a recommendation from Amazon and was also lured by the low price attached to it. The premise also intrigued me for I have read many end-of-world, Armageddon style, dystopian universe type novels in the past. Wool is now one of, if not, my favourite among them all.<br /><br />Hugh Howey creates a very intricate self sustaining world within an underground silo. Wool Omnibus Edition is comprised of 5 stories, each one longer and more detailed than the previous. Each story provides more information than the last on the inner workings of the silo, from law enforcement to political to technology to agriculture and so on.<br /><br />Each story is also wrought by the relationships between the characters. This is what Howey does best. The relationships he creates are the backbone of the stories. When reading them I became so attached to the characters that when something goes awry I feel like it's happening to me. When an author can evoke such empathy in the reader, it's indescribable. Even more so when that great feeling is not just reserved for the protagonists but also in the antagonists.<br /><br />I was very happy to read that this book has been picked up by a publisher and will be in book shelves March of 2013.<br /><br />I know this isn't much of a synopsis, other people I'm sure have written one, but I just wanted to let others know my deep appreciation for this book. I highly recommend this book to all. Whether you purchase this as an e-book or wait until it's on shelves, please pick this up, you won't be disappointed.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Love it. Great condition. I love watching this movie and having the trilogy. I would recommend this movie to family and friends.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I don't know if I'm the best person to review this, as this is my first Kurt Vonnegut book. I read this due to all the wonderful hype I have heard about throughout the years.<br /><br />I read the book with no foreknowledge of what to expect and I'm glad I did. It was a delightful read. Easy to read and understand. Vonnegut also does a good job of describing the characters and surroundings which help you lose yourself in the world he has remembered and created.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to reading more of his work.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Great book, very quick read and a must for anyone who really wants to understand the english cannon.  I think I've seen 3 &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episodes that feature the same plot though, kind of ruined the surprise halfway through...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Extremely hard to put into words how much I love this book.<br /><br />Quick synopsis - An orphaned teenager, Wade, being raised by his aunt and living in poverty stricken subsidized housing sets upon a scavenger hunt within a global virtual world called the OASIS. This scavenger hunt was created by one of the creators of  OASIS, James Halliday. Halliday lived a very secluded life, never married and has no heir to speak of. He left his entire fortune, which is huge!, to the victor of the hunt. The location and answer to many, if not all of the clues, lies within Hallidays passion, 80's pop culture.<br /><br />Whether you're a fan of 80's pop culture or not, there is a lot in this book to keep you interested.<br /><br />If you are a fan of 80's pop culture, then you are in for a treat!<br /><br />Ernest Cline does an excellent job with melding together an abstract decade with future technology, while having very likeable and real characters along the way. For being his first published novel, I am simply blown away.<br /><br />I was so entranced by this book that I even started researching and taking part in some of 80's culture alongside. I was born in '81, so I am familiar with some of the pop culture references but I was also too young to understand and catch them all. I made up for that though by playing some of the games mentioned and watched some of the movies as well. I really wanted to immerse myself and participate in the hunt as well. This book was very hard to put down as well, I just wanted to keep reading. Mind you, I read all my kindle books though an app on my phone. This is one book that whenever I see it on shelves at a book store, I have a desperate desire to purchase it, even though I can read it anywhere I am.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone, whether you understand all the 80's references or not, you will not be disappointed. I  sure wasn't
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so realistic just wish it had more to do when beginning kind of boring and it would be better if you could make money and gems easier!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I found this when I was just browsing around. I love it. I always wanted a horse, and now I can have one without breaking the bank!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|A very uplifting and inspiring movie. Leaves you reflecting about life and the personal choices we make to make it more meaningful.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|This is such a cute movie for the whole family and I love Emma Thompson, Colin Firth and Kelly MacDonald.  The kid actors do a splendid job. There is a clear, underlying message to everyone about judging people.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Its works ! What more could you want? Need a facebook fix in a hurry ? Its all here. Latest news ? whose dog died? Great for the train ride home.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|A few peaces of paracord rope and this book All you need to entertaine your children. the best book there is
B007VUA7VO|5.0|So much better than looking at that annoying little square blip Kindle calls a battery guage.....great graphics, track on metering and easy to read.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|it just keeps getting better and better, I live in a place without internet or cell singal and with this I can download in town and watch at home, it's great.
1416960953|3.0|If you must have everything-Spiderwick, you must have this Field Guide. A collector's item for adults, and a tangible extension of the those story-things otherwise only imagined. 2-Stars for Novelty. Another star for Design. Had the quality of the binding and paper been a bit better a fourth star would have been in order. And finally, the price is now too high for a fifth star.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|Everyone seems to agree that 'Abbey' is a fine show, so I'll take time to discuss what the show is not.<br /><br />'Abbey' relies not on gratuitous sex scenes... thigh-slapping humor... action, car chases, shoot-outs... whore costumes or hideous weaves... slam-bam editing or annoying music.<br /><br />You'd be surprised how a quality show can hold interest without all of the usual suspects Hollywood has conditioned us to rely on to make up for a dearth of talent & substance on its part.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I cannot BEILEVE how good this book is. Charming, clever, and romantic, this book struck me when I finished it
0875428940|5.0|When I knew these cards were to come out, years ago, I watched my local bookstore that carried that sort of thing.  When I opened that first pack, they spoke to me.  I have had many, many different packs of Tarot cards before and after, but these are my go to deck for all my public readings, (rexannasreadings.com), as well as my private ones.  This is probably my sixth or seventh pack I've owned.  I keep wearing them out. Thank you Robin Wood.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|1828?!? That's amazing! Wow! Kiloo is obviously booming! This is a live free die hard company! The only bad thing about this game is when it gets updated, meaning no more Tony the Cool kid boo boo :&quot;(
B009KHBDUU|2.0|It's ok but a little disappointing.  Tim Burton has a tendency to go too far from the original product on remakes.  He did so with Planet of The Apes, which was even a greater disappointment.  In his treatment of Dark Shadows, it was too obvious that Barnabas Collins was a creature of the night and no mystery that he was a vampire.  Johnny's makeup from the get go was pasty white.  Johnny has always picked parts that are off color.  That is why I like him, but I was hoping he would have been a little more enigmatic with the character as Jonathan Frid was in the sixties TV soap opera.  And maybe that was what was missing from the film.  It should have retained a &#34;soap opera&#34; trait about it. It does seem to be left open for a sequel. Let's just hope if there is one, that it will be more exciting to watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Cool game!! Great. Time waster stepson got me started on it play every night.not much else to say so I'm gonna go play !
B003YBUSMW|3.0|The wheel worked well and everything, and it does help improve lap times by a small fraction once u get use it. It's not like driving a real car, and at first it's hard to get use to if you used a controller for so long. and since i dont have a PS3 i cant use a G25-27 racing wheel which i would have purchaced instead if Logitech would have provided it for the Xbox.<br /><br />The real reason i gave it 3 stars is because i would have much prefered if it would have at least come with a 3rd paddle for the clutch, and since i play using -Manual/clutch- playing Forza this wheel doesnt help, however using the wheel does make turning much smoother than using a controller.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|very good book.takes no time to read at all.  dhxhxhdhdhdhd nd hchdhxcbdbchdhcbxnshc bc h rd jcjdjxjcjdj how hard how hard h
B0029QRA1U|2.0|This would work very well if 1) my records weren't worn out and 2) I had more patience. It takes a loooooong time to do (the length of each song) which I should've known better. If you have the time and the patience, it'll work very well for you for the price.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like this game and was so grateful that I was able to access it on my Kindle Fire
B006LSZECO|5.0|I have become something of a Gillian Flynn junkie. I started with Dark Places, then read Sharp Objects, and finished with Gone Girl. They all hold the dark, mysterious plot twists, but Gone Girl really ended with a bang. It left me wanting more, thinking about the characters even after I finished the book. I am a very avid reader and devour books like they are cupcakes, and very few books can draw me in the way this one did. Highly recommended, and a purchase I haven't regretted!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome. I like how it challenges you. People everywhere should play this game. My favorite part is how they are doing a tour of the world so you can surf everywhere. My experience with this game was great. I play this game almost everyday.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|From self destruction to helping win the war on terror, this book shows how we can live fearless when we place our faith in Jesus Christ and never surrender. Thanks to all who are fighting and winning this war against global terrorism.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds rocks in my house it's fun for me at 36 and my son n step daughter too we fight over the kindle it's funny
B00AREIAI8|5.0|HELLO I am the Doctor and want  to tell you that this app is brilliant and I must say so myself I can't enjoy this as much as I enjoy my Tardis
B006SAR0OK|5.0|Tarantino's finest writing in my opinion.  The character of Bill is just unbelievably show stopping.  You can't take your eyes off.  The second part has much less action than the first which makes time for all the back story that was left out of the beginning.  Very satisfying payoff for an amazing movie series.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|DON'T KNOW YET IF I LIKE THIS SINCE I HAVEN'T USED IT YET.<br />i DO BELIEVE THIS WAS ALREADY ON MY KINDLE
B001ANYDAO|5.0|An amazingly different perspective on people and success. Liked the fact that it was backed by logic and data. Must read !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is the best version and its free! it has more turns  and jumps. I just love it
0156711427|4.0|the shipping was very fast and was packaged well. the book was in very good condition when i received it. no torn or bent pages. the only writing or marks on it were someone's name on the inside cover and a school stamp on the rim of the pages. the main reason i gave the transaction a 4 instead of a 5 is because the book was an old high school copy, and i was not expecting that. i would have preferred a regular version copy, but the book is in very good condition.
B00AIGQTEC|1.0|I don't RENT my music. I want something physical to hold on to.<br /><br />This trend needs to be stopped right the hell now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Amazing. This game is so addicting I always play it now!! It is a must buy game!! After a hard day this game actually makes me feel better.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hollywood are you watching! This is what we want to see! 3 dimensional characters. Educational historical interesting believable trip into cultures of the past. Shades of grey story (like in real life). Suspense. That's all.
0765325950|3.0|This book was an adequate ending to the series but Bandon Sanderson is no Robert Jordan.  Much of the book seemed rushed, some of the wrap-up stories seemed contrived and many details about the final status of the characters were vague.  After 13 other books (I've reread the series after each new book came out) the reader becomes seriously invested in the characters.  I think the reader deserves a little more to the wrap-up.  The finale for Rand was also vague, and though the reader can figure it out, Sanderson's obtuse treatment of the ending of this epic was not up to the task, though I will grant him that it wasn't his story to begin with and he had very big shoes to fill.
B002C7GBQG|1.0|I expected the whole album not one song!  I am asking for my money back!  Dont be fooled.<br />I expect more from Amazon
B0063IH60K|3.0|This has a lot of games. I've tried a couple and found them entertaining. I wish there were a way to change the rate of winning.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|The World at War series is the best of the best. If you watch only one of these excellent videos, watch \\"Remember\\". The French village is preserved as it was left after the slaughter and is a testimony to the horror of war. The visual images and the narration touch your heart. Sir Laurence Olivier is amazing; his voice is so perfect, so civilized while the visuals are so cruel and dehumanizing. Remember.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|This is one of those sleeper hit movies that do horribly in the theater and when you see them on Netflix or Amazon you wonder &#34;Why is the rating so high?! I thought this sucked?&#34; -- then you watch it and realize it is a movie more true to the comic book so commercially it may not be as flashy and stupid as is required to rake in big bucks, but as an individual sitting at home watching it, it was awesome.<br /><br />Gory, intense, focused, good acting and solid special effects. I had no complaints, there was a lot of TLC  put into make this movie and it shows. Just a badass/gritty comic book movie that was perfectly cast.
1594487154|3.0|Good information, but the way Daniel H. Pink writes is not as pulling as some other writers.<br /><br />It's good, just takes a bit of dulling to process.
0765325950|4.0|I've been reading The Wheel of Time series since the early 1990's, and to finally reach the end was both a joy, and a sadness.  The book was almost all I hoped it would have been ... almost.  A few points felt forced, or a bit of a let down.  Without any spoilers, all I can say is, if you have been reading the series as long as I have, you will read this one, and you will enjoy it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's good, creepy fun.  My students have started downloading as well.  It also behaves quite well on the kindle fire hd.
1741798981|4.0|It is hard to be all things to all travelers.  This book does a good job of giving you a sense of the place and contains much useful information.  Obviously books like this go quickly out of date, but this one is about as current as a published guide can be.
1616550414|5.0|I have very much enjoyed the book itself. It is good quality and so far contains lots of cool artwork and interesting trivia about the Zelda franchise. The book did arrive damaged, though. One corner was bent, and given how poorly packaged it was for shipping (it was free to slide around in the box, only being padded on the top) I didn't bother exchanging it since the next one might be even more badly damaged. I am still rating the book five stars since it shouldn't suffer for Amazon's lax packaging, but be warned if you're unwilling to accept less than a flawless book that you might not get it here.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great stress relief for me to get off work and clear my head. Glad I found this game on Facebook it's really helping me.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well its not as good as xbox360 edition but its still the best app in the appstore. its the best!
B0099114WO|1.0|great actor and actress but very bad movie.  bought it because they were in it but would not watch again.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app has some qualities that are better than the first one like different power ups the camera doesnt move when u slide and the mines are cool.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Absolutely loved the music in this edition.  Alfie Boe.....it's hard to find the right words....he is amazing.  After watching this production, I go to bed with the songs in my head and wake up with them still there.  Best Les Miserables so far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It has all kinds of world tours and you get new boards for a limited time and characters. LOVE IT
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was never able to feel any compassion for any of the characters, especially the main ones.  There was nothing uplifting about the story - just a &#34;downer,&#34;
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book  so sad when rue dies interesting the whole way through especially when peeta ends up with a fake leg
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love this game. The graphic are so good,  I'm excited about how far ive got. I only wish I could keep the sound effect. Without the music.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its is addictive if you liked the first temple run you will love this one. amazing game. I would recommend it. do it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|dragon story is really fun. it gives you something to do. I like it because the dragons are really cute.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|Actor playing judge dredd terrible, lost interest.  The original movie much better and at least it seemed it could be followed with better story line.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Free app and gives me all info needed to know current and extended forecast.  Also alerts you to weather advisories.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME EVER! LOOOOOVE IT! I love this game! Im playing it 24/7 because it has to be the best game ever! But where's the new update? For 6.0? Please update and it would be the bestest app ever.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you plz make minecraft like the x box360 version. I love the game but I just wish that you can have a pet wolf and switch the version and fishing and armor
B002N5N4M6|4.0|My grandson rates The Big Bang Theory series as very entertaining.  He is a fan of the program and owns several seasons.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Boring, it was repetitive iin its interaction between the two main characters , it was predictable and I was very dissapointed in the overall book
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm so happy about this. visually more interesting and way more rewarding. I like all the new interactions and I feel reward for lasting longer
0792839676|5.0|the movie Carrie is touching she is a sad, lonely ,sweet girl but others brings out the powers even she didn't know she had you has to watch this movie if you has not done so
160774273X|5.0|Not through the book yet...but since you requested review: Forkish really seems to know his stuff. Isn't afraid to either make fun of himself or to admit that he IS a 'good baker'. His quest for perfection, his resoluteness in following his dream, and his good writing all are inspiring. If you really want to learn technique and the 'why' of bread baking this may the book for you.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|only app that allows me to sync my google tasks between my fire and android phone.  calender looks great and it's much better than the stock android (even the one on jelly bean)!  I would recommend this to anyone.  Great buy

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Just finished this great book and I've already started recommending it to colleagues and friends. The fiction-novel format makes it accessible and easy to read for anyone who works in or with IT.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing the impact that this book will make in IT organisations around the world!
B006YW6KX4|5.0|I first got interested in this Movie because I hade been collecting Movie soundtracks for my music Collection I hade found out that the first commercially Availablystereo recording you could buy was  a 78 longg play record of this Movie in 1956, It wasn't til I got the Laser disc version of this movie that I heard the soundtrack And I found out the Movie was pretty good as well, I still have all butt the VHS version ( the tape hug up in the Dann Machine)So that was that,  Buy the way,  Great Movie, Great widescreen Picture,  crisp and definded, And yes True original from 1956 stereo soundtrk- or in this case mixed to 5.1 DTS lossless disscet sound,  Enjoy ,  Hihgly recommended .....
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is so cool, but it's not letting me update this game to 0.6.0. Please help or tell me what to do. Please!!!!!!!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I read some of the reviews before I downloaded this book, which was a free book on the day I ordered it. Even with the bad reviews, I felt the good reviews meant the book would be a fairly good one. I had no clue it would be as tedious as it turned out to be. Normally I will read a book in two days. It took me nearly a week to slog through this one.<br /><br />First of all, if this is what YA are reading today -- WHAT? I've not read the Twilight books but some reviewers compared this book to that series. If I had a daughter, I'd certainly not want her to read this book and in any way believe this is the \\"norm\\" for college or relationships.<br /><br />I could not buy the characters in this book as \\"true\\" or \\"real.\\" Yes, it is fiction, but at least some semblance of reality should be built into the characters, setting and plot.<br /><br />Travis is supposedly very bright, does well in college, yet participates in brutal fights to earn money? And, neither he nor his partners in crime are ever involved in any way with the police. In no college I know of could a student beat another one in the cafeteria (blood is involved) and walk out with no repercussions - over and over. How can that be? After the fire, the police were involved, but Travis gets off scot-free somehow, even though he was in the thick of the fight. And, he makes so much money he can fly here and there, buy furniture and pay his living expenses with just the fighting to fall back on. I know it's fiction, but those things are more like fantasy.<br /><br />As for Abby, the story is set up to account for her having no parental input. But, it is not at all believable for me to imagine a girl going away to college as a freshman and having absolutely no one looking out for her in the parental role. She was \\"raised\\" by America's parents, but they seem uninvolved with either girl. Her character begins as a strong young woman, but is drawn in by this brutal and controlling person who is Travis. She trailed Parkeralong and he gave her an expensive gift after knowing her for only a week? His character is built to be wealthy, but the gift, his apartment, the family business -- all seemed way too over the top. Abby's relationships were like picking the petals off a daisy - love him, love him not, love him, love him not. And, the reader had to read each tedious minute of this on again, off again relationship, just as someone else said - it was like a middle school girl's diary.<br /><br />America does have parents somewhere, but they never figure in with any sort of advice or to act as parents. There are attempts to make America seem strong and smart, but they are half-hearted.<br /><br />\\"Shep\\" is the cousin of Travis, but he plays along as though all these things are normal. He wins America in the end, but most college-age kids I know today don't opt for marriage so quickly in relationships.<br /><br />I can imagine a rough life for Abby with a controlling and violent partner. What a sad ending.<br /><br />The setting is limited, with a couple of forays to Las Vegas. It seemed odd that there were no sporting events for the college, no freshman orientations, or no other events aside from the fraternity parties and fights. Even the mob plays into the plot but that line is easily removed by choice of the college kids, which is likely a doubtful scenario if this were to happen in real life.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book. I finished it so I could write a review, but it was a chore.
0547884591|5.0|Having read and loved both Tim's previous books, The 4 Hour Work Week and The 4 Hour Body, I hoped that his new book would build on their success. I wasn't disappointed. Creatively written and laid-out, The 4-Hour Chef is insightful, clever, and much more than a cookbook.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This was exactly what I wanted and needed.It preforms any task I need. I recommend this calculator to every one.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Have been a Bocelli fan since first hearing his voice.As a man I even get a lump in my throat when I hear him sing.As a music lover and a musician I personally enjoy a great singer that is well produced with lush backing music.His producers and management are interested in one thing,selling product to the most diverse listeners they can.This is a big world that contains a diverse population of races and cultures, not just Americans.So does he leave out the Brazilians because you don't think he should sing bossa nova's,or the Italians because he sings an Italian pop song and not an aria, or the Latin Americans because he sings a bolero? Mabye his management shold warn the stuffed shirt critics about the content of his next album.He's a great artist with a God given voice that I consider a gift to the world no matter what he sings.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Very fast delivery, great addition to the flashlight. I would recommend this attachment to anyone who purchases the flashlight, makes it very handy to not lose!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Don't get me wrong, sometimes a tentacular alien trying to enslave the humans is a grand read, but some of the very best sci-fi is simple and rock-hard.<br /><br />This is one such book, and I dearly hope the author keeps writing - this was an excellent book.  So good, in fact, that when I was done I immediately wanted to read it again (and would have, but I had already loaned it to my wife to make her read it).<br /><br />A good read, nicely edited, with a protagonist that you can root for and filled with tense, edge-of-your-seat moments throughout; if you like science fiction, you owe it to yourself to read The Martian.
B000FCK9D6|5.0|What can I say about Agatha Christie that hasn't already been said over all these years? Still entertaining, relevent, thrilling, and unexpected!
B005COO1X6|5.0|As with most of Stephen Kings writing, I didn't want to put this down.  It captured my attention, and sucked me in......just like....oh I'm not going spoil it for you. Read it, you'll find out for yourself.
0812993292|5.0|This a beautiful and poignant story of an ordinary man caught in a life and a marriage of dullness, deadness and pain. Harold and his ever critical wife, Maureen, have been married forty-five years and Harold has recently retired. They barely speak to each other and have shut out the rest of the world. Then Harold receives a note from Queenie, a friend he hasn't seen in twenty years. He learns she is in a hospice and dying from cancer. This launches Harold on an impromptu walk six hundred miles to see her, believing the promise of his coming will keep her alive.<br /><br />His journey leads to delightful encounters with people along the way and with the beauties of nature. Harold reflects on his life as he walks and experiences new things. He begins to hope and trust in others and in himself. There are surprising twists and turns in the plot and it is beautifully written with profound wisdom about human nature and the difficulties of life. This is a memorable, touching story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a very entertaining game. My sister has bought many horse games, but this free one was the best.
0525478817|4.0|I don't know John Green's work outside of this book; but now I'm hooked--have to explore him more.  At any rate, read this book; take away from it that which will help you \\"live your best life now.\\"  You'll see life, death, pain, suffering, true love, parents, trite but insightful friends, and one wannabe Yoda alcholic.  While \\"some infinities are bigger than others\\", this book expanded mine. I think it will expand yours too.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. It has started to force close now. Please find a fix. I don't want to have to uninstall, and then loose all the levels, and coins, and gems I have earned.
B006ATJXQW|3.0|I really enjoyed this book, although after getting attached to the characters in the original 3 books, I really wanted to know what their role was in setting up the Maze.  Although it was interesting to learn how the Flare had been spread and the ideology behind it, I was really missing Thomas and Teresa.  I truly feel that maybe 50% of the book should have been dedicated to the spread of the Flare and the other half to the original characters who we fell in love with.  Overall, good book but don't expect it to fill in much back story.
B004HD61KE|4.0|This was my first Sigma Force novel.  Considering I started mid-series, characters were well defined.  I will definitely go back to the beginning of the series and read the others!
B006LMMN8I|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this album.  I was introduced to Gregory Porter and this album &#34;by accident&#34;.  Glad I stumbled upon this incredible recording.  I listen to it at my desk from my home office and it places me in a good mood which subsequently helps to improve my productivity.  Great musical quality, and the Brother has a voice very reminiscent of Donny Hathaway.  I will support his musical efforts from here on out, consider me a fan.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After some slow going in season 2, this season picks up the action and the tension rises. Carl makes up for being a whiney kid this season and T-Dog actually has something to add to the group now. The new characters they added to this season help flesh out the world a lot more and The Governor makes a really diabolical villan. I could go on and on about how awesome this season is compared to the first two. Maybe it's because the second season was so slow or maybe because this third one is so much better. I just know that I'm enjoying the heck out of it and can't wait to see more!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I seriously LURV this app.  I have it on my phone and Kindle.  It makes a pen and paper grocery list look simply outdated!
B008B92U32|3.0|Would be so much better if you could copy the face fo another picture instead of the same photo kind of silly to just swap faces
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's wicked user-friendly.  I wish the forecasts were a bit more accurate, but than again, I live in New England so it can't be helped.  I use this app on my Kindle and my smaht phone every single day. GO PATS!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is amazing. It might take a couple of episodes to really get into it - but I promise, it's like wine and just gets better with time. The more I watch it, the more I love it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like having the option to calmly waking to 1D singing to me or hearing the Yeah Yeah Yeahs to really motivate me.  Great app!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|What a perfect ending, and comeuppance, for a great show that ended before it's time. I keep watching over and over and never get tired of it. I wish it was longer - could watch it forever!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a free calculator, it does what it says. A tad bit annoying that it doesn't flip on my Kindle.  I usually end up using my other cal app on my phone.
B000002H5I|5.0|Came within two days of buying the cd. It was used but look new! Which is amazing for how old it is.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is amazing to help us learn how our couple feels loved. We may be doing all the things we can to show our loved, and they may not be feeling it because we are not using the right &#34;language&#34; for them.
B0038QMREA|5.0|Came extremely fast. It was a very good price. And it was new! Glad to pick this up. Would deff buy again
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I go to this app nightly to check the weather and what is going to be happening the next few days. Love the background sky scene....very classy.
B007CIQ4B2|5.0|Probably one of the best cd's I've brought. I listen to it everyday since I've got it. It came within two week.
B002NKP6TK|5.0|I have been looking for years....This is one of my all time favorites.  Teaches a lot through humor. I can be found many a Sunday afternoon watching it over and over.......
B00936A2SM|5.0|Wow! There's really no need to listen to anything else for the rest of the year. top notch musicianship and choice of material-everything from Herbie Hancock to weather report performed by the most incredible power trio in years.
B000JQUMPI|4.0|It has adventures as well as relationships and humorous sections. Even though I struggled through some parts I still think that it is a great book.
B003L77G38|5.0|It rules, one of my absolute favorite shows! So sad to see it go. Love it love it love it.
B00821OUT6|5.0|The characters, the overall story, and the acting/directing are five out of five! Rarely do I rate a show this highly but if there were a six star rating I would give it that because it's just that good! I especially appreciate the portrayal of the protagonist (Tom Mason) and the character's use of historical events as teaching points and motivational tools. This is a fantastic show and unlike so many shows on the air now, it's not a total waste of time.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|From the beginning of the book Nicholls draws you in with two people who could not be more different. As you read on the story evolves as well as the characters. You find yourself holding out hope for this young couple as they meet each other only one day a year.
B009RH9HDS|4.0|Just receiver this item a day ago but so far so good.  Seems to function well enough; kinda cool looking.  I'll know more following my upcoming trip to the islands.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the bomb diggty!!!!! I love it I play it non stop!! Disc bigd Christchurch th uh finished uh f.  Sideburns dif f2f
B00AC8ZA3M|4.0|I really liked it i've been waiting a long time for a halo movie and i feel they did justice to the series. It wasn't perfect but almost no show ever is. I would recomend this to anyone who is atleast a mild fan of the series.
B006L0A5P8|5.0|You will have to look up &#34;installing key file from drop box&#34;. Getting the keychain file into drop box is not what you would expect.<br />Once you follow the directions it is straight forward and works well.
1616550414|5.0|This encyclopedia of zelda goodness is full of artwork and goodies! Every Zelda fan should have this in their library.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Love it so entertaining and I know I am 10 I think this is the best book available  Love this book!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The second season is as good as the first season. We are definately hooked as we follow the story line.
B001N4RORE|5.0|My daughter and I love this movie.  I took her to the theater to see it and we watch it at least once a month.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Hopeless, and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend it to my friends.
1558908382|5.0|If you went to high school in the mid 80's and seemed to think a 10 year reunion wasn't necessary to attend, then you will love this film.  One of the best alternative 80's soundtracks out there.  John/ Joan Cusack and the whole cast including Minnie Driver, Dan Akroyd and more have a great time in that awkward get together, when you know that somehow, your life is nothing like the rest of your graduating class.  This was so appropriate for me as I joined the Army right before college graduation, fought a war, went through divorce and so much others.  In ways I longed for a life like so many others in my class, and other times feel so lucky to experience what I have.  The movie really hit home for me.  One of the best movies from the 1995-96 era.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game I love this game only because I love horses. if feels like you really own a horse. its awesome
B0057ZAA6W|5.0|This show has a great cast of very flawed characters, but their are some great performances by Robert Carlisle and Ewan McGregor.  The rest of the cast plays their roles just as well.  A tale that shows the consequences of playing to much with the opium poppy.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|It was a very good movie. We went to see it at the movies and liked it so much we bought it.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Saw this on PBS and was only to happy to add it to  my collection. I enjoyed it so much. It  was such an intimate and personal performance. Enjoyed the ending with the orginal cast members the most!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful read. Held my interest! I would love to meet Dr. Alexander in person and have a one on one talk.
B00008973A|5.0|A wonderful dance filled video. I love seeing it on the small screen excellent purchase for me a fan on musicals!
B006TKP2B2|5.0|timely, well written science fiction  great developement of characters, intriguing possibilities due to climate change and genetic engineering.  I really enjoyed it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Hours of Fun, Hours of Entertainment, and Hours of Goo....<br /><br />If you ever played lemmings, its similar but then again also very unique in its own way.  Id suggest you to give it a try.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome and awesome and awesome and awesome and is better than temple run and temple run 2 combined. My high score is somewhere around 2 million points
B001OMJGD0|5.0|Kal-El, a.k.a. Clark Kent, a.k.a. Superman. The first and greatest superhero ever.<br />He's faster then a speeding bullet, he's more powerful than a locomotive, and can leap over tall buildings in a single bound!<br />It's a bird! It's a plane! No! It's Superman!<br />That's right, it's Superman, portrayed by a dozen actors in a score of films, TV Series, and too many comics to count. Superman - the superhero that will never go out of fashion, the campy, all-American, big blue boy scout.<br /><br />This time it's Brandon Routh portraying the Man of Steel in Superman Returns - directed by Bryan Singer. Superman Returns received a decent critical response - a 76% critical approval on Rotten Tomatoes. But it didn't make that much of a splash with audiences.<br />But I am here to show you why Superman Returns is a great film filled with humour, emotion, awesome special effects, stunning action, first-rate acting, and a respectful attitude towards the classics. I will also take a look at the upcoming film Man of Steel, directed by Zack Snyder and compare it to the source material. Shall we begin the review?<br /><br />1. GREAT CAST AND CREW<br />Superman Returns is excellently cast, and the talent in front of and behind the camera is undeniable. The obvious place to start is with Brandon Routh - the actor who plays Superman, but I'll leave him for last.<br />Instead, I'll start with Bryan Singer.<br /><br />Singer broke out on the big screen in 1995's with his second film [[ASIN:B00101ZOTK The Usual Suspects]] - a twisty, complicated, darkly comic neo-noir starring Stephen Baldwin, Gabriel Byrne, and Kevin Spacey. But Singer is known best today for his X-Men Trilogy, the first two installments of which ([[ASIN:B000IMKDPC X-Men]] and [[ASIN:B000I9U8VO X2]]) he directed. The X-Men trilogy starred huge casts of talented actors as Marvel's mutants, including Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart. The 5 X-Men films to date have all been huge successes, with many regarding X2 as one of the greatest superhero films ever made. They certainly showed Singers uncanny ability to handle huge casts of characters in a single film, something shared by all great directors (think Peter Jackson).<br />In addition to Suspects and X-Men, Singer has also directed Apt Pupil, Valkyrie, and Jack the Giant Slayer (due in theatres soon). He will direct X-Men: Days of Future Past in 2014.<br /><br />The rest of the great crew is rounded off by regular Singer collaborators screenwriters Michael Doherty and Dan Harris (X2), composer John Ottman (The Usual Suspects), and Newton Thomas Siegel.<br /><br />But the real star of the film (no pun intended) is the cast.<br /><br />Full review coming soon!garding X2 as one of the greatest superhero films ever made.

B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Just discovered this game and it has been most entertaining while I am bedridden.Suggest that you use the coins you earn playing to buy extra colors (Marco Gras pack) which will.add green and brown to your drawing tool kit as having the extra colors helps the other person to guess more accurately what you are drawing.Enjoy!
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is a must read for a child, but even as an adult I enjoyed it!  The characters are just like us!
B003YNFYCO|5.0|This is like the Beatles I remember in the 60's when I was in high school, the music is great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is addicting to play I play it all the time this game is sooooooooooooooooooo fun
B001O5LVPI|4.0|It was for my grandson, he likes it.  I have not watch it, but he is happy and that is the main thing.  Thanks  Denia
B00992CF6W|3.0|I think it's a good game but where's 0.6.0? I love minecraft on my kindle but I have to play 0.5.0!I do have a android 2.3 and I'm no getting 0.6.0! Not fair.
030758836X|1.0|I like books with at least one redeeming character, but everyone in this book was awful!  There wasn't a single good event that happened in the book after this toxic couple romantically met.  It reminded me of movie, \\"War of the Roses\\" where the couple had no limit to what they'd do to hurt each other.  I can't imagine the author being a well-adjusted happy person.  Who come up with this stuff?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is one of the best apps on earth!!With the world tour version about every 27 days you go to a new place.You can search it in the appstore for free, just search subway surfers world tour free.(All searches must be in appstore)
B003TH2LYY|5.0|It's an awesome show!  I hate that they give you a certain amount of characters in order to write a review.  no wonder no one ever writes them.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I liked the book it is really nicely written i recommended this book . I only read the first book.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is a great game and I definitely recommend.  Thre are are a ton of games out there but this is a good one to use.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Love Nelson DeMille!  Always have.  I've waited for this for a long time.  Can't wait for the next one. Keep it up Nelson!
B003QTNFHW|5.0|Highly recommend this movies for all the family.  The story is good for all ages.  Grandma can watch it with her grandchildren.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Interesting and reasonably accurate picture of the climate, fears, hopes, and changes of the radically different  '60's and 70's.<br />Engaing, fast-paced and truely interesting depiction of a mythical small town in that era.<br /><br />Nice!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Do not really care much for Bruce Willis but this was actually a good movie even with him in it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|This is a very nice back pack for your camera, but it was bigger than we what we wanted,so we returned it. It seemed to be a good quality product, just to big for our needs. Yukon Garry
B0098VYKSA|5.0|Was done very well, stayed close to the real kids story with an adult twist. Had good special effects and lots of good action.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great book by John Grisham.  He has a great plot that has several curves to keep you in suspense to the end.<br />There is more than once you will ask yourself &#34;why has the main character connected with this criminal?&#34;
0062215507|5.0|After seeing the revised edition at a bookstore, I found it online much cheaper.  However, in my haste ordering it, I managed buying the first version.  Instead of returning the first one, I gave it to my little sister who was very happy.  Finally got it right by ordering the revised edition which my older sister got for Christmas.  The book is fantastic with extra goodies inside.  Harry Potter fans should not pass this up.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|What can I say - I am a weather geek and this is TWC after all!!  Very easy to navigate and lots of options.
B005FISC52|5.0|Had purchased another set from someone else for a Christmas present and they did not work properly.  These were great!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|Good thing this was free because it is useless - awkward - does not adjust to fit page like other apps and will not link correctly.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A while ago after reading some dreadful modern fiction, I commented to my son that I couldn't find a good book to read. He said \\"go back to the\\"Classics\\" Mum\\"<br />He was so right. !<br />This must be one of the best reads and well written books I think I have ever read.<br />It has a good plot, well fleshed out characters, is a balance of Good v Evil and how in the end the love we have for each other can overcome any tribulations.<br />Hugo has an amazing vocabulary , the descriptive passages in this book were such a joy to read. He set the scene of the city, the mire, the characters look and feel.<br />It took ages to read, but it was well worth the effort.<br />I think its not for everyone, but for those who do manage to read the book, Les<br />Miserable is a very good insight into life in Hugo's world.
143911000X|5.0|Absolutely hilarious. Got her fast and had me in stitches immeadealty. A must read for any bro and a must share with friends
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of my all time favorites and the first half of this season does not disappoint. I like zombies and this show is a spectacular representation of a plausible real-world scenario.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, I can quite literally spend hours playing it, trying to get from one mission to the next!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game but it gets old after a while. But this game gives you a feeling of what it's like to actually have  a horse.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game in my favorite game on my kindle and i suggest you get subway suffers . It is so fun and challenging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is like having my own horse. Now I don't fell so bad that I don't have one.
B000ETQR3Q|2.0|With active boys, their toys need to be durable. One drop and the scope broke off, it jammed up often too.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|This is a fun movie and it's great for being mindless. The first one is way better but this was a fun follow up.
125000568X|5.0|I was so happy to open this up!  I was not expecting all of the awesome extras that come with it!!  A must have for ANY Queen fan!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a wonderful addition to the series! The books picks up quickly and there is never a dull moment, I was biting my nails the entire book. I can't wait to start the next one, I have to know what happens!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|All three movies, in a well constructed trilogy case, with an Ultraviolet digital copy? What more can you ask for!
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Love this movie! This was a great movie from the series. It had everyone involved. All 4 of them had something going on that they had to deal with which is nice from the series when it usually focused on one of the girls. But what a great chick flick about how your girls will always be there and you should forgive at some point.
0525950079|5.0|I love ancient and medieval stories and Mr. Follett's style of relating them is superb! I hope he doesn't change his style of writing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was absolutely fantastic!! I cannot believe I have not read it sooner! Absolutely amazing, unbelievably creative and you really get into the characters. I read it in 2 days and couldn't put it down
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I can't personally recommend this book; mainly for two reasons.<br /><br />First, I don't believe in reincarnation, and that was the basic premise of the book. So you have to get through a really long book with multiple stories that can only be tied together with a belief in reincarnation.<br /><br />Second, I wouldn't want to live in the author's world he creates in the book. Selfish, dark, and depressing. That sums up the characters and the worlds that they live in. You could argue that the author's view is the \\"real world\\", but I would disagree and say that we all have a choice.<br /><br />Also there were lot of sexual references, you couldn't get too far in a chapter without someone having sex, consensual or not in some cases. I assume this was a technique to keep the reader's attention, since it didn't add much value to the story. I got the impressions, that to the author, sex has no meaning other than to fulfill each character's own lust. Gratefully, he doesn't go into much detail.<br /><br />There were some things I liked about the book. The author's switching of style in each story and the author's use of language was impressive to say the least. The vocabulary matched each story time frame very well.<br /><br />Again I wouldn't recommend this book, and I don't foresee watching the movie anytime soon.
0743289692|5.0|This. was. amazing. This woman is amazing! Absolutely amazing! It is an autobiography and I am not usually one for these but I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. The only thing that kept me from finishing it faster were my two graduate classes in June that required an immense amount of time. I don't even know where to start to explain this book. This woman is an inspiration to what can be accomplished no matter the circumstances. This woman has endured unbelievable things (things I never even imagined could occur) and survived. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to learn more about a brave, smart and unyielding woman in a culture that holds none of those qualities
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers its like temple run ......... but better i recommend this to everyone it is so addictive
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a wonderful series!! I loved it! This was a wonderful ending for such an exciting story. It had me guessing up until the very end. A must read for anyone!
B000HCO83G|3.0|The weakest from the original X-men trilogy, I didn't like how they did the phoenix. They should've did it in outerspace like in the comic books and the cartoon. It's not the actors fault I'm mostly criticizing the story and the whole anti-climatic battle towards the end. There are a couple things I did like though, like after Professor X is killed Magneto showed some respect for him. Ask for Wolverine he's just badass that's all I've got to say about him.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey deserves all the praise that it receives - acting, sets, costumes, drama, comedy, etc. However, the mischievous Julian Fellowes, the writer and creator of the show gleefully proclaims in one of the features in the third season that he is the grinch that stole Christmas and he certainly is that. He laughs that his audience will be crying at the end of the Christmas special - from the creator of cruel characters such as Thomas and O'Brien, I suppose we should not be surprised. J.K. Rowling was warned by other writers that killing off Harry Potter would jeopardize future sales of her books, so she came up with a creative solution. Fellowes did not. The world has enough injustice and misery without this. I will be selling all three sets today. I cannot see that will ever want to rewatch it, excellent as it was in many ways.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I find it amazing how little people care about hurting other peolpe's feelings.  Ture colors shown and vicious actions seen.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|This is a great CD. This is one of those classics that deserves a grammy. I enjoyed this CD from from front to back.
0345803485|2.0|Boring and over rated to me and my daughter who read my book.  I guess it sells as it is a bit different than the normal novel. It wasn't disturbing at all,  it was more of a physcology book.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Nice to hear from Eric. This CD, I guess reminds me of my career, &#34;Chuck Sadosky&#34;. Great piece of work from Eric especially because he wrote most of the material.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie has the perfect balance of action, humor, and romance. Joss Whedon did a great job at blending all the different Superhero stories. Total fun!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|Never wanted it to end! I would live a sequel to see how Danny and Beth live out their lives.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|If your an ac/dc fan there is no better live concert film out there in my opinion!! Get this one and enjoy.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Perfect pop songs sung from the heart. Listening to them sing together is always an incredible experience. But this time, the songs are so well-crafted, supremely produced and ultimately uplifting that I wonder how any other album will measure up to this.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I bought this CD because I liked the songs and I was not disappointed.  She was an amazing voice, as everyone knows.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love to play this game but it FREEZES to much it also does not turn when u want it to turn which is very dumb.......... sometimes I hate this game I do not recommend this game at all<br />.
0061743526|2.0|I had a hard time reading it in school and I had an even harder time reading it for my book club. It is well written.
B008MM9630|4.0|this is a single player game.  meaning you are not dependent upon pals to help you build things or finish goals.  that is a plus for those who don't want the responsibility /pressure of being on daily to assist others.  it is nice to play a game without worrying who needs what and when - etc.<br /><br />I find that the gems are fairly easy to earn (early on anyway)  - but, think goals may become prohibitive in higher levels due to gems required to complete them.  expansion for gems only is a bad idea.  you get one or two upgrades for cash - then need gems.  there should be an either or option as found in other comparable games.<br /><br />money gathering fine - but goals that require you amass certain amounts prohibit you working other goals at same time as you go back down with each task costing money.  getting 20,000 is pretty difficult when you need to be planting and buying plots.<br /><br />in any case - I wont play this one further.  but I prefer communuty gaming versus this type.  that is not issue with game - purely personal preference.<br /><br />I think many younger and tweens will enjoy and certainly some adults too.<br /><br />christine
B003UBTX6S|5.0|If you are a Harry Potter, Deborah Harkness, or Twilight fan you will enjoy reading this series of four books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The product is something fun to do and your kids would love it. If your bored it helps but gets tiring.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This first book of three (which hasn't come out yet) it great. Fans of Twilight will love it. I couldn't put it down! Great book.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's my Perry is my favorite game besides where's my water. I love that it uses physics. Also, the characters are cute and funny
8866130915|5.0|my go-to staple every year: great size, weight, layout. i just love moleskine and this is my favourite of their products, it accompanies me all year and is just so useful.
B000VDUWMC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I think Diamond did a great job of weaving an interesting perspective on the development of human societies.
B0081X8AE6|5.0|this one came recommended by none other than john c mayer and i have to say, what a great find. michael's music is authentic, real, and soothing. i love this album and urge you to give it/him a try! can't wait to see him live when he finally comes back to europe.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob was interesting especially in light of Columbine, Aurora, Newtown and other recent mass murders. I have often thought of how difficult it must be for the parents of children who could commit such dastardly acts. Its so easy to be in denial of our own child's true character. Ithought the book was totally predictable and knew just where the author was going.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|unfortunately, when we attempted to view Hope Springs we were informed by Apple that they were having problems and could not supply the film. We look forward to seeing it at a later date.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This book goes beyond attempts to disgust the eater with images of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, kill rooms, etc. It digs into the real ethics of the options we have at every meal, and accomplishes that in a fascinating way on a plethora of levels. Read this book if you're excited about food, agriculture, health (micro and macro), and the changes we need to make in this country.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is such a fun game. I use it with my grandchildren. They love \\"helping\\" me find the cards that go next in line.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|my entire family loves playing this game from my 2year old to a 35 year old. its just the right pace and it doesn't get boring.2 thumbs up
B009O2XY12|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. First time to get this type game. I would recommend this game for mothers who need to entertain youngsters
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book definitely gave me a lot to think about, and I'm sure it will result in some changes in how I view possessions.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I have to say i wasnt rally expecting much since im a 30 year old and its a teenage movie but i really liked this movie and would buy it also
B0097L29KM|3.0|Got must of Neil's records which are good to great but this just labours a bit too much, the playing is nice but the majority of the songs seem to go nowhere.<br />I bought the 3 vinyl set which is nice but whoever designed the booklet should be sacked, it's that small I didn't realise there was a booklet inside, the type is way to small to read even for a CD package, what a joke, actually the guy who put it together was probably taking the piss and succeeded.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is so twisted yet shows us how \\"love\\" can destroy some of us.  I could not put it down.  If I try to talk about the plot I might just spoil it for you. It is a not to be missed book.  You will not admire any of the characters and the end leaves searching your imagination for the final stages of this \\"greek\\" tale.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Great for family movie night. Both our boys, 7 and 3, enjoyed it. Not what I expected from the trailers; I was pleasantly surprised.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|excellent read, i like the way he writes and his characters are very interesting, and it always ends the way you want it to

B00AE2I4B6|4.0|Loved it. it was a great love story and I love all the dance. Go Twitch and all the dancers.
B004TI5N38|4.0|i have read alot of suspense novel by many authors and baldacci he and lee child are my favorites so far
B00APUQPX6|5.0|This was a good family movie. Everyone from my husband to my 14 yr old loved this movie. must see
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I lost over 100,000 points, numerous boosts, unlocked characters  and had completed over 30 missions when this occurred. I also lost the use of the double coins that I purchased, feeling real ripped off.  All this after app update yo Rio version and previously giving this game 5 stars.  This review edited 2/4/2013.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Am readying it now.  I ready constantly and I am really enjoying this book.  IT has been keeping my attention from the beginning and if it doesn't grab me fairly fast, I will not continue.  This book, so far, has kept me wo ndering what will happen next.  I am usually a mystery type reader, but this is keeping me interested.
B002QGSYRC|4.0|It's not a bad history of the Korean War, mostly told through the stories of individual soldiers during individual incidents.  However, the author's biases come through big time with constant sniping at the Republican Party, who he seems to blame for all that is wrong in the world.  He even snipes at George W Bush, certainly not something that belongs in a supposed history of the Korean War.  The book is well written with interesting stories, but the author's preconceived notions prevent this from being a great read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Entertaining and fun.  Great way to pass the time.  Also, easy to catch on to.  I also like the different options to pic fofr the game.
0743298039|5.0|Settle down by the fire on a cold night and pick up this book.  You won't stop reading til morning.
B009JBZH54|4.0|box set-great content; box itself not dazzling but can't complain based on price.  the extras alone should be worth an evening of entertainment...just not sure if i will ever pull it out to watch.  booklet interesting but not enough meat to the material.  would have been nice to have some background refresher
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I recommend  this book for twilight fans that enjoy the internal struggles of  self t doubt and don't really need the characters to act but talk about what's around the corner for them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome .. I love it's by so far the best app I played I lovvvveee it. I recommend this app to those who enjoy playing games

B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book was exciting and definitely a page turner. How ever the story line was predictable the characters and details of this story are interesting.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|What can I say...LOVE THE SERIES...had to get the latest installment.  Can't wait till the nest one comes out.... A MUST HAVE for you collection.
B000KZBRG6|5.0|This meter is great! It's good if you're just getting started using light meters. It's simple to read and there's an attachment that lets you put in the hotshoe of your camera! It's perfect!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed the second book far more than I expected to. I feel the story came around in a believable way. The writing and editing are not the best I have read. However, a great story makes up for it.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|I thought it was a childrens movie, but for I can see it is not.<br />Havent had time to see it yet, but its probably o.k.  I bought it for my grandson but I dont think<br />he will like it just yet.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It really is wonderful! I edit pictures all the time. It's easy to use, too. :) wonderful app. love it.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's very predictable but nice none the less. I loved the ending. Would recommend for sure
B006H5120E|5.0|It was great to watch this movie in 3D, so much more enjoyable.  I loved it and recommend it to everyone.

B004R6JG7G|1.0|I ordered Top Gun and it would not play in my Panasonic 3D DVD player, I sent it back and ordered another copy with the same results, it didn't play either.  I'll get it from Target the next time I go there.

B007PVHMCG|5.0|This is a very cool and compact set.  Completed, it's about 5x5x5.  You can basically put it back in the box when you are done without having to disassemble it.<br /><br />90% of the pieces are 1x1 flats & plates.<br /><br />There are enough pieces left over that you can make another Steve-like man (wearing a different shirt).<br /><br />This is definitely something I would recommend to anyone who plays Minecraft.
