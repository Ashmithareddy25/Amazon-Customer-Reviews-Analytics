B00F35BV64|4.0|If Shane Black wrote a Star Trek movie, it would probably be a lot like this. It's a buddy-cop flick with Kirk and Spock instead of Riggs and Murtaugh.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|Just as good as all of the Iron Man Movies, Definitely a must see! Actually just go buy the movie!

B005UG53NS|5.0|Very entertaining indeed, however, those who have read the books and know the plot well enough might find the movies 'loosely' based on the novels.  If you have not read the books you'll fully enjoy not only this one but all the movies in the series.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Another so-so zombie movie. But this one was a little different in tempo. Fast-running zombies. A little more militant at fighting the scourge. Good kill-some-time flick.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Awesome with the best calculator. So I will do the calculator forever everywhere all the time. So so so so so so coooooooooool

B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great story line and terrific acting.  Surprise appearances by &#34;real &#34; people such as Joe Trippi and Barry Scheck and Fred Thompson.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a fun game to give your mind a tricky time but once you have figured it out its quite simple.
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Weak Story line and not very good acting. Tried it because I enjoy must of Will Smiths movies but this was not one of the good ones.

B009DH2PP4|5.0|No matter how long you've been homebrewing, you will inevitably find something in this book that you either didn't know or had forgotten.  This is the most straight forward and helpful book for really understanding how to brew.  It offers various levels of detail based on your own interest level.  It's a must have.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|This was a good movie which depicted how some people treated slaves.  Some were almost nice to them and others were scum who would have better suited the world by not being here.
B00CATONCA|5.0|It's arrived in Brazil after 6 days of ordering. Further more, It has a high quality and all details are perfect. I totally recommend this product.
0345511468|5.0|This book has some great stuff inside and look forward to reading more soon!  My only gripe is the way it was packed.  Amazon used to shrink books with heavy duty plastic around a corrugated board to prevent moving around, but now it's just loose in a box with some paper wrap inside to pad it, but it still moves around in the box some.  I'd recommend the older technique for a book this heavy.
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|Excellent addition to the Harry Potter series! It makes for a quick read, but if you appreciate all things Harry Potter, you will enjoy this book =]
B00FPH6M82|1.0|And some are even worse.<br /><br />Really poor storyline, unbelievable sequences, and a non-interesting lead.  Everyone in my house (vampire, zombie, sci-fi fans) hated this movie except my youngest.
B003QP4BJM|5.0|Matt Ridley's new book, The Rational Optimist is one of the best investing book. The book is an sweeping account of human history through the eye of evolution and economics, this book is a devastating, fact-driven, often empirical, cogent argument against today's de facto media dourness. Ridley uses economics and evolutionary psychology to chart the upward trajectory of human civilization with astonishing acuity and insight. Ridley's positive thesis is that<br /><br />Trade and specialization among non-associated has been the key driver of growth and innovation and has allowed humans to advance beyond their imaginations and other living creatures on the face of earth. There's a great amount of strong evidence that humans had been trading since past 80,000 years over distances as far as 100 miles, and there's a good probability that trade existed even far beyond that time.<br /><br />There is no denying with Matt that trade is the key to growth and prosperity and only innovations can fuel trade. Aside innovations, rest of the factors assist trade but cannot ignite the fire of trade. Unless there is a sense of need no one wishes to trade and innovation creates those needs.<br /><br />Its no wonder that innovation and optimism are like synonyms that go hand-in-hand. Optimism fuels innovation which fuels trade and finally leads to growth and prosperity. He spends an inordinate amount of time complaining about the press's propensity for pessimistic headlines. Ridley takes jabs at a host of highly respected individuals including but not limited to Al Gore, Lester Brown, Rachel Carson, E.O. Wilson, and George Monbiot.<br /><br />Most readers would have watched the movie \\"Titanic\\" which was a beautiful love story with a tragic ending. Now consider an alternate ending of Titanic which is more pleasant and joyful, where Jack and Rose survive, get married and live happily ever-after. Would you will still consider it as an passionate and emotional love-story or another run-of-the-mill movie? You wouldn't! Why? Because we love tragedies, applaud sacrifices. They raise our curiosity and excitement and are more distinguished from regular events to stand-out in a crowd.<br /><br />Several intellectuals writing economics books - as a group - don't tend to be optimists and many psychologists have used tragedy and fear to their advantage in predicting a future that is dark and detrimental. This attracts human curiosity as survival comes before growth and any prediction that impacts survival will get more attention and response even if the probability of its occurrence is almost zero. As a staunch optimist, yes, Mr. Ridley is very biased. He's a freewheeling, no-apologies capitalist. He believes capitalism is as natural as natural selection. He thinks humans' natural overconfidence in themselves and capitalism are intertwined and symbiotic because capitalism is all about the pursuit of individual goals and not those of the elite. And while his rhetoric is highly compelling (in the opening chapters he bludgeons us with statistic after statistic of positive things in the world), one could easily argue he's being myopically optimistic just as pessimists will be myopically pessimistic. It's not until the end of the book that he balances his argument and acknowledges--almost in an obligatory way--much of the world is still a heinous place with big challenges ahead of it.<br /><br />Some of the most noteworthy thoughts in this book are:<br />- Our capacity to swap, share, or simply walk off with ideas is what distinguishes humans from other social creatures like chimps, mole rats, wasps, and ants. Although that seems like a rather obvious observation, it has had huge ramifications.<br />- We are not smarter than our immediate ancestors, we just reached a kind of critical mass of population size and density that allowed the trade and exchange of ideas to take off.<br />- Life is easier for much more of humanity as a result and like it or not, the only way out of the mess we have created (as far as biodiversity loss and climate change is concerned) is to keep moving forward hoping that market mechanisms can be found to incenticize the preservation of what remains. We can't go backwards with a population heading for nine billion.<br />- We already had automobiles, airliners, antibiotics, vaccines, nuclear bombs, skyscrapers, television, and toaster ovens in 1945 when our population was about two billion. Technology growth was already fully exponential.<br />- We are much less likely to make war on trading partners who are providing us with golden eggs; free trade is a very good thing overall.<br />- Government bureaucracies, be they military-industrial supported by conservatives or social services supported by progressives, like weeds in a garden, cannot be allowed to grow ad infinitum.<br />- Bloated bureaucracies in the market are eventually weeded out by competitors but government is a monopoly. Government bureaucracies have no natural check on their populations.<br />- History is replete with examples of governments becoming so large and ineffective, with massive standing armies of both soldiers and bureaucrats, that they bring about the collapse of their own society.<br /><br />Anything excessive is dangerous and that applies to extreme optimism also. I believe at the least, we should balance today's thrum of pessimism and get a dose of optimism with this book. The part Ridley has missed completely is that he doesn't give pessimism its deserving due. Worry, fear, and the preparation and adaptation they spur in us is a very necessary thing for the progress of mankind. Personally speaking, we should be react to minor disasters, calamities for they make us well prepared and anticipate coming dangers - often negating problems before they happen or expand. It's just not a good baseline perspective for long-term investing. The goal should be to achieve - BALANCE....ay out of the mess we have created (as far as biodiversity loss and climate change is concerned) is to keep moving forward hoping that market mechanisms can be found to incenticize the preservation of what remains.

B00AYB0TOW|1.0|gratuitous violence for the sake of violence. really bad plot line. Even the first one with Sly Stallone was better than this
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Well written, good plot with twists, 3+ stories within one, and a set up for many sequels - I hope!
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Overall, the movie was good.  However, it did not stay true to the book.  Of course the book is much better.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|This little jewel made my Kindle Fire  perform better.<br /> I suggest this as a good tool to have for regular use.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Season 5 was a great season! Castle and Beckett in a relationship was a great change for the show. I didn't think the show could get any better than the first 4 seasons, but it does. And so far season 6 is off to great start. This show only seems to get better and better. Nathan Fillion & Stana Katic have amazing chemistry and this cast is one of the best ever. I highly recommend this show to anyone! It really is one of the best shows to grace tv! And some of the episodes feel like you're watching a great movie. My only complaint is watching one hour of this show isn't enough!!!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|can't expect much from this game, but it's actually fun. what made it lose stars for me was the fact that the invasive ads would crash the app. i would have to put my kindle to sleep mode to get out of it. and restart the app. also a good handful of the ads had no way to close them once they where open besides going to sleep mode as well.
8866135879|4.0|All I wanted was a small simple calendar that had a full month and then weeks behind them to write appointments etc. on. I like to see the full month at a glance and be able to then turn the page to write on individual days and I do not like the &#34;cheap&#34; pocket calendars that are the 2 year month only. This calendar does NOT have the month first and then the weeks that follow. I knew that buying it. I also wanted something light and small to fit into my purse without bulk. This sort of met this. It's exactly 3/4&#34; thick, and 3 1/2&#34; x 5 1/2&#34;.<br />I love the elastic band that keeps it closed in my purse and the &#34;built in book marker type ribbon that marks where I am.<br />I have an iPhone but I like to hold and see. I like to be able to flip the pages back and forth, not a screen.
B00BGIC170|1.0|No plot.  You keep waiting and nothing happens.  It is not funny.  Do not watch this movie unless you need to go to sleep.
B00F3W9NQ2|5.0|Totally addicting so far.  The characters and the plot linea so far is returning more the their &#34;glory day&#34; ways which will make any fan enjoy every single minute of it
B00DU74U74|5.0|Different outlook on the movie, I would say rent it, give it a shot.  good sci fi movie that is worth a quick view
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|If there were a radar page, it would be perfect.  Updates quickly and does not drain battery.  The temperature on the status bar is easy to read.
B0007939NO|5.0|hokey? sure it is but great entertainment.  been in love with Brigadoon and Gene Kelly since I first saw the film almost 30 years ago.
B004VN39YG|5.0|Great movie and actors and actresses.  Entertaining and not boring at all.  Will recommend this movie to family and friends for sure!
B0089OBLDO|4.0|Using it to connect my PS2 controller to my PC. Came in looking in good condition, didn't need any more set up besides plugging it in. Seems pretty responsive after using it for a couple weeks.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Thought provoking, light hearted, human and intense, I really enjoyed this read ******** it made me think about a number of people, including myself, differently
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Intense action - holds your attention with detail and movement of the characters - creative story line - leaves you wanting more.
B009OYTIXS|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this because I wasn't much of a Green Arrow fan from the Justice League cartoons. Never read any Green Arrow comics, but this show is awesome! And very well thought out! Vigilante's rock anyway.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this all of the time. It is always right and saves me a lot of time. It's easy to use and its not slow. I love this app:)
B003HGKJH8|5.0|... this is an excellent album. Lonerism is another great album by Tame Impala. Really, there is no reason not to own both as they are great from start to finish. Love the cover art, love the production, and of course every song.
B00A757EFW|1.0|I love Pac-Man but this game is not easy to control.  I was really disappointed and would not buy it again..
B008IJTFYW|5.0|exactly what I was looking for. I love being able to select multiple sounds and their individual volume levels. great app!
B005CAPS0K|4.0|Scary stuff Insidious will make you sleep with 1 eye open, I saw it before but still weird things happen
B00337KM2S|1.0|This was not one of the better movies George made,don't buy it, it was boring and I tossed it in the trash and didn't even watch a half hour of it.
B00ESB6GBY|1.0|I would not recommend wasting money on this product.  I absolutely loved this show and could watch it over and over again, but so far season 9 STINKS!!!  I've watched 4 episodes and haven't laughed yet.  Major disappointment!!!<br />There is no storyline whatsoever.  All the characters are boring and not themselves.  The cast as a whole is very good-looking, but this season Marshall, Lily and Robin are not looking so good.  What changed since last season?  And please don't add a baby to the show, it it only occasionally exists.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I'm a big fan so I had to buy this. Came on time and quality was good., and the price was right.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a good game.  Play it on a Kindle fire.  Don't like all of the ads that you have to tolerate.  I particularly like the three suite.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|Perfect episodes. Love them all and looking forward to the next season. Good acting and interesting to watch. Highly recommended.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Much better than I expected from Brad Pitt.  Made me think about a real &#34;zombie apocalypse&#34; and how would you actually survive it.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed the book, which was one of the books selected for our book club. Most of the other members liked it, too, mentioning the subtle humor most often. I liked the writing style. I found it very poetic at times. Example,&#34;Fingers of thought are raking the space behind the cushions, looking for loose ideas, finding nothing.&#34; (page 58) I read that line twice just to savor the image.<br /><br />One member really disliked the book because of the details about computers. We all wondered if the things Sloan talked about with the computers and Google are possible.<br /><br />While I loved some of the imagery, I thought that the relationships were thinly drawn. I was surprised at Clay's depth of feeling for Mr. Penumbra a little way into the book when Penumbra was previously portrayed as rather strange, mysterious, and a bit remote. I felt the same with other characters, from the other members who borrowed books to his relationships with his house mates.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable read.
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I consider myself a fan of Daft Punk in general, but this soundtrack is pure heaven. I loved the movie and thought they were an amazing choice for musical talent and it really takes me back to the best scenes from the movie. Aside from that it is just great music overall. Plus the bonus track Sea of Simulation is fantastic, the digital booklet is a nice addition, and it is a digital download stored in Amazon's music cloud which is always a plus for me. I'm the kind that prefers digital over physical medium.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I Loved it and I will recommend it to my friends. I will look for more books by this same author.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm on Pinterest all the time and this app is great! I have it on my phone too and I love it.
B00ADLCC9I|1.0|Bought this for testing games on and is truly awful you cant load any top games at all its not a tablet and the controller is very poor poor and totally integrated -- no memory -- completely sucks
0143120581|3.0|I was thinking this book would be more about how a Asian mother raises her children in all areas of life. Giving me some fresh ideas and new ways of thinking.  But, it was only about how the mother trained her daughters in the ways of piano and violin practice. It got pretty repetitive after a while. I wouldn't buy it again.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|My only complaint is that it doesn't adjust when I turn my kindle right side up. Other than that it's great!
B00BU18U82|4.0|My kids just love this game.  My 9 yr old boy thinks he is a real farmer now.  Wish they would make the PC version more affordable.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I totally recommend this movie, I have wathced it a dozen times aleady =)<br /><br />The product is just great !
1400095204|5.0|Full of fascinating characters and vivid description, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's story was one of those stories that riveting me. I finished it in a matter of days. For those who love stories centered on strong characters or detailing times of political change, this novel is for you. Also, for those who want to learn about a country often overlooked on the global stage, this is a fantastic piece of fiction with which to start.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife an I really enjoy it. Lookin forward to the new Season..the characters and storylines are very interesting..watch it!!

B0068THAGY|3.0|Interesting for 1st hour then kind of boring and more senseless for remainder of the film. Would rather have been cleaning my attic in hindsight.
031623480X|5.0|This is a fascinating book written by a very knowledgeable Medical Doctor.  While most doctors haven't a clue about nutrition, this doctor would run circles around any of the doctors with television shows (one in particular, has repeatedly given out some very incorrect info. that makes me shudder).<br /><br />The basis of this book is that we are what we eat.  Dr. Perlmutter, M.D. proves this by showing the actual brain scans of people when they eat grains and other carbs.  He believes that the root cause of many diseases such as: ADHD; Anxiety and Chronic Stress; Chronic Headaches and Migraines; Depression; Diabetes; Epilepsy; Focus and Concentration Problems; Inflammatory Conditions and Diseases, including Arthritis; Insomnia; Intestinal Problems (celiac, gluten sensitivity and irritable bowel); memory problems and mild cognitive impairment - which he thinks leads to the development of Alzheimer's; mood disorders; overweight and obesity; Tourette's Syndrome; and others. Additionally, he challenges common wisdom regarding cholesterol (is 240 really dangerous)- read the book and see his advice.<br /><br />In essence, once you ingest your food, it turns to sugars, how these sugars impact the brain and resultant hormones the body releases is fascinating.  This is something that was not even addressed in any classes I had in school.  Change how those sugars are metabolized and you can change your health!<br /><br />After he addresses the various medical conditions mentioned in the last paragraph, he directs the reader to eating a diet which has a much lower carbohydrate intake.  All sugars must go including things like Agave (do some research this is dangerous!).  He also directs those serious about making changes to focus on fruits with less sugar (no dried fruits, melons, pineapple or mango or most of what you think of as fruit); his definition includes: avocado, cucumber, tomato, squash, lemons and limes (although he allows that berries and some other fruits may beeaten in moderation).  He gives you a list of what to toss from your kitchen and how to restock.  This is essentially a paleo focused portion of the  book, but better explained than others I've read.  He includes recipes, which are convenient since they include ingredients that you will find at your local grocery store.  While I didn't find some recipes \\"inspiring\\", they would be great for those who don't typically cook and they are simple and don't require much time.  The \\"Cauliflower \\"Couscous\\"\\" sounded yummy and is definitely on my list to cook soon.<br /><br />If you are like me that wants to know the \\"why\\" behind behavior changes, this book gives some great information along with some very convincing documentation.  He cites the China Study (which I encourage everyone to do an internet search on) as further substantiation.  He also suggests a number of blood tests that will help provide deeper and more accurate insight on your specific health challenges that your doctor may not have done - in my area, you can go to a lab and ask them to run a multitude of tests, you don't need a script just the money to pay.<br /><br />This book is both easy to read and informative.  The material is logically presented and not bogged down with lots of statistical facts.  It is sure to be a best-seller for those who want to have a healthier body and mind.
B0015AARJI|1.0|My son gave me this controller as a birthday present because the original that came with the PS3 console developed a pronounced problem: the left analog stick started centering itself and sticking in a non-neutral position (characters walked and I didn't even need to touch the stick, menu options scrolled by so I'd wind up clicking the wrong one even as I tried to stop the scrolling). That controller wasn't even a year old ... but that's a different grumble.  I'm one who simply expects a $40 device, especially one with the Sony name attached to it, to be well-constructed and work, so appreciating the technical aspects of a controller, beyond making sure I've got the right one for the job, isn't a priority. The device rumbles. All the controls do what they are supposed to do. That level of detail is pretty much sufficient for me. However, out of the box, this controller's upper left button (L1) was loose, never seated properly and, while it did work, felt sloppy. Meanwhile, the right shoulder button was stable, solid, well-seated.  A controller's hand-feel is, to me, a huge part of the console gaming experience. When I play, I want to forget I have a controller in my hands, because being reminded by a problem pulls me out of the flow. I suffer Sony's controllers (much, much prefer the hand-feel of the Xbox controller) because certain games are PS3-only. I imagine a lot of ergonomic design goes into creating a great controller, but my hands assert Sony has always been second to Microsoft in this respect. It doesn't help that Sony controllers feel of lower quality construction overall and, in my experience, have been problem-prone.  I'd like to be clear and fair: I press the L1 button, and while it wiggles and is noisy, it does work. It has worked the first time and every time since. I'm disappointed in the quality, but I'm not exchanging the device. An annoying L1 button is peanuts compared to a seriously wonky left analog stick! But, at best, it secures this product's average rating.  ---  Edit: Almost 11 months to the day, I replaced this controller (the black one), because it acquired the same problem as the Sony original it had replaced. However, *both* analog sticks on this replacement developed that annoying, documented non-centering/sticking problem. Both! In less than a year! What to do? Sigh disapprovingly and get another. This time I chose the blue version. I wasn't having much luck with black versions; the blue was less expensive; reviews said it felt sturdier than other non-black colors. I really, really don't care about the color of a game controller. I just want one that will work for longer than a year. (Don't tell me all controllers have a functional, max-one-year lifespan ... I still have my original XBox 360 controller. It still works like a champ.)  Not impressed. Two controllers in two years. But then, they do say third time's the charm. Or maybe blue's the charm. Or maybe this controller was made on a non-lemon day. Fingers crossed.  ---  Edit (Summer 2016) The third controller stayed in the box for a year, as gaming had to be put on hold. 2015 saw us return to intensive gaming. Finally opening the box, we hoped 3rd time would be the charm. *sigh* Within the year, the problems were even worse than the previous 2 controllers. Both analog sticks stick, such that the camera will spin non-stop until you manually recenter the stick. As for the left stick, I can't tell you the number of times my PC has walked off edges and died because taking the thumb off the stick doesn't stop the directional movement. I don't know if this is a bootleg version. Having watched a few YouTube videos on spotting fakes, I see aspects that look like the original that came with the system. There are also aspects that don't. Either way, I'm dropping this review to one star. This level of poor performance is simply not acceptable! Not once and certainly not multiple times.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|but don't think this is a children's movie.  just check out the director's credentials and you'll see the types of films he makes.  Smart, funny, thinkers.

Not easy but worth engaging - listening each time unfolds more passion and meaning to his eclectic words & phrasing.<br />As a dancer, I can count on David for irresistible dance songs as well, and I am pleased to be working out to several of them. Even<br />slower beats work well on the elliptical machine because intensity drives you forward to do more.  And he did. I wish he sounded happier, but serious has been his way to help us all face the truth of our collective soul.  Thank you David Bowie for gracing us with<br />this poetic music.

B000FC2PKG|5.0|I read one of Lisa Gardner's earlier novels years ago. Although it was a very good read it did not compare to this fascinating story! I have seldom read a suspense novel that  intrigues primarily through the character development. I felt as if I knew the main character personally by the time I read the end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I reread The Shining before reading Doctor Sleep...and I'm glad I did. I forgot how good it is.  Doctor Sleep is just as good.  It was fun and sad to see how little Danny grew up.  Can we expect to see how Abra turns out?
B0018OFNHC|5.0|Greatest movie Al Pacino has ever made or will ever make. Far and away. The storyline is incredible. the movie exciting  beyond belief. And then is the wondrous romantic relationship he has with the dancer Gail. The complete movie from beginning to end. Perfectly acted, written, directed and photographed. My al-time favorite movie. I could watch it again and again.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Takes you from zero to hero (well, at least pretty dang good) in a short, fun game-playing format. I already speak Spanish, so I'm going through it by testing out of each lesson, so far anyway. My son is supplementing his High School Spanish with this. He zoomed through it all. Now he's logging in as someone else to do it all again and make his basic skills even more sold. Highly recommended!
B008602KQI|3.0|The book was much better, especially in conveying the relationship between Katniss and the two &#34;men&#34; in her life, as well as what happened to her mother. I would read the book again before I'd watch the movie again. I've read the whole trilogy. The movie was really lacking in substance.
B000JCK3ZG|5.0|This one is a bit darker than the previous three. Well acted & written. Love all the action! Great series
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Well, I just returned from NY CominCon and happened to stumble on this gem of a game.  Played several rounds with my sons and two nephews.  We all had a blast!  Creative, easy to learn and just plain fun.
B001O53BK6|3.0|Overall not too bad, it has some good laughs.  The opening scene is ridiculously comical, in a Jim Carrey over-the-top kind of way, but after that it's more your typical comedy.  That's not necessarily bad, it was just kind of odd how the beginning of the movie and the rest of it didn't have the same tone.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This is a great series. Easy to watch with characters that you become concerned about; as if they were friends.<br /><br />Great to watch at the end of a long day.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I almost fainted when I saw this on the Amazon prime site.  Been wanting to see this again for decades!  Thank you!!!!!

0399226907|5.0|We are due to have our first baby at the end of the year and I was so happy to buy this book and know that I will be able to read it over and over again to our little munchkin!
B0001XPZGA|5.0|Simply awesome.  I have had the CD for many years but the Vinyl version is outstanding - a feast for the ears.<br />If you don't have a deck, go out and get one today.  You don't know what you're missing!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Cubistry has been lots of enjoyment with the opportunity to make matches on a 3D cube or a non-mobile one.  Both challenge enough so you want to persist until things are completed.  Good to pass some time and able to finish later if you get busy.
B00FEN1C50|1.0|Where do I begin with this piece of garbage?<br /><br />- Horrible storyline full of plot holes and people doing things that make no sense in the world around them.<br />- Manufactured drama where there didn't need to be any- you're a dumb action movie, don't take yourself seriously.<br />- A romantic angle that was thrown in there just for the hell of it and also seemed to be the motivation for the idiotic concept of multiple pilots required for one robot.<br />- Terrible cinematography and CGI.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie is that it ended.<br /><br />If you want good dumb action that doesn't take itself seriously, look for 80s classics like \\"Commando\\" or the more recent \\"Crank.\\" Hell even the Matthew Broderick Godzilla movie was better than this.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I don't often leave reviews for anything but this game is outstanding. I can't wait to see what else Pandemic adds to it. It can only get better.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie was just as good as the book... not something I often say.  Jennifer Lawrence is very good as Katniss.  She's believable and portrays the hard and soft sides of this heroine well.  Can't wait for the next two movies!
B009YQ92C8|3.0|The book was a little more damaged than expected (It was torn), but all in all good for its purpose. I will clarify the condition of the book in advance next time.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Fits my Kindle Fire very well.  It keeps the Kindle protected and yet still accessible.  I do with the open stand position locked into place.  The lid just sits on a ridge to hold it in place and its not overly secure but overall its a nice cover for my kindle.
0316204366|5.0|This is a really inspiring and excellent book.  I don't think it was ever intended to be the definitive scientific proof of anything.  The topic of hardship and it's ultimate purpose is way to big to arrive at any ultimate scientific proof.  The author is a story teller.  He is connecting stories with a theme running through them to get us thinking about some of life's biggest questions.  He is using real stories and some data to propose a thoughtful question about life.  It is different from his others in that it's much more emotional as it is facing much bigger questions. I found the book entertaining and inspiring.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|the graphics were pretty cool and the game was easy enough but way too short for the money you have to pay.  a map would be nice too.
B002VHI8J0|3.0|found cloud atlas as bit hard going and not always sure where the author wanted to be.the language was difficult to follow but maybe on a third attempt it could be interesting
B007SOQBCM|4.0|Works wonderfully well but it is till missing the functionality that would enable you to watch VOD's. If that were available than I would have to give it 5 stars!

0385351399|2.0|1. If a social media corporation were to achieve a complete monopoly of all public and private information, we'd be in danger of becoming a totalitarian society.<br /><br />2. People often willingly give up their privacy for convenience, societal benefit, or a needy and self-centered desire for affirmation.<br /><br />If these premises seem facile to you, you might not enjoy Dave Egger's new novel, the Circle.<br /><br />The writing is straight, mainstream, third-person limited narration. You won't find any of the layered themes, complex metaphor, formal experimentalism, stylistic prose or psychological lyricism common in modern literary fiction. Whether you'll consider this a bug or a feature is mainly a matter of taste; but it's worth mentioning, given Eggers' McSweeney's pedigree (this is the first book I've read by Eggers, so I wasn't sure what to expect).<br /><br />The protagonist is Mae Holland, an enthusiastic, naive and downright submissive young woman (surprise) who gets a job in customer service at the Circle, a company which, having subsumed Google, Facebook and Twitter, is on the brink of achieving the complete monopoly mentioned above. Mae does not think deeply or critically about anything that happens to her, and her motivations are often inexplicable. These are qualities that serve Eggers' narrative goals more effectively than they do the reader's enjoyment.<br /><br />Eggers' goals seem to ride directly on the surface of the narrative. Almost every scene reads like a mini-lesson on the deceptive utopianism of the huge dot-coms, the superficiality and false emotional appeal of online \\"sharing\\", or the creepiness of voluntary corporate surveillance. Many passages set the narrative baggage mostly aside and are rendered either as polemic dialogues or speeches delivered by one of the characters. There are also many product presentations, designed to bring the creepiness into maximum relief. There's also a little sex and a lot of longing for a man.<br /><br />In an interview, Eggers stated (seemingly with with pride) that he did not research technology or technology companies to write the book. The result is a skewed, pop-cultural vision of the corporate campus (few developers are to be seen, and no one is depicted actually writing code); a cartoonish start-up culture that doesn't mine into the strangeness that can be found in memoirs on the subject; and a few truly wince-inducing concepts about computer technology (\\"the cloud\\", for example, somehow does not require physical storage).<br /><br />The lack of focus on the way technology actually works and the way software companies actually think is not a criticism in itself. But it leads to a lack of engagement with the truly complicated moral, social and political issues that arise with online privacy, over-sharing and corporate ethics. The treatment of these issues in the Circle is simplistic and one-sided. And there is little to be found *aside from* the treatment of these issues.<br /><br />Beyond the transparent preachiness, the most disappointing part of the Circle, for me, was Mae herself. Although Eggers sometimes beautifully documents her thoughts (especially her rationalizations and distorted perceptions of others), she is, at bottom, not much more than a vehicle for what Eggers wants to say. There is no real fight - from Mae, the public or the government - against what the Circle is trying to do. If I should rightly be afraid that a company like the Circle will drive us all off a cliff, I'd be better-served by a novel in which the author doesn't simply hand them the keys.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|I have ordered two of these watches one for me and the other for a friend of mine.<br />both are working fine looks same as high quality watchs 200$+, watch does not feel cheap at all, of course not deserves the first original before discount price, but can be compared with watch with 200$ around price tag, watch strap is a little bit longer than normal, strap material (the black cloth) collects dust and dirt quicker than normal leather straps which leaves the watch as if its used for ages, but you can use leather shoes spray\cleaner and it can restore the new fresh look back to it.<br /><br />Never tested the watch under the water.<br /><br />watch is accurate. some people complaints that in stop watch second hand has to do many rounds\laps while resetting the stop watch to zero, worst case when 30 minutes have been passed out, resetting the stop watch while being at this position makes the seconds hand do 30 rounds (for the 30 minutes) to reset the stop watch minute hand back to its zero position.<br />if less or more than 30 minutes passed, stop watch minute hand will rotate clock wise or opposite to clockwise in order to minimize the second hand number of rounds. In all cases it happens fast and for me I like to see it rotate and do many rounds after using my stop watch.<br /><br />Box smell is so bad not the watch itself as some people says.<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Big bulky and has very good wight.<br />- Easy to read big numbers and glows well in dark.<br />- genuine leather.<br />- 1/10 of second stop watch.<br />- looks as expensive as 2X $$$ watches but not 8X and 9X as announced.<br />- Tachymeter scale on inner bezel gives even bigger look.<br />- blue reflective dial.<br />- Lefty design.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Strap material collects dirt so quickly (can be washed and cleaned not critical deal).<br />- Strap little bit longer than average (i have average to below average wrest size).<br />- One of the watches has its Seconds &#34;the Red Arm&#34;is not 100% aligned to all digits and hours grades especially from hour 9 to 12 (Don't worry not easily noticeable).<br /><br />I recommend this watch for anyone looking for a sporty casual watch that looks nice and not cheap at all with good features.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loves this saga and went on to buy the additional offerings from the same author. Great story. I have recommended it to many friends who also loved it.
0143122061|5.0|Political science and history buffs would love this book.  Easy read, very interesting. Makes you want to read other ancient civilizations not yet explored.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I rented this movie from Redbox. I liked the movie and found the cinematic representation of Earth beautiful. I liked the military based story of an adolecent boy being challenged to overcome his fears and grow up.  I'm surprised at the backlash against the movie however, I only paid $1.20 to see it. It is not as fast paced or ovewhelming as most bloackbuster science fiction movies.  It's just a nice story and I enjoyed it.
1878424319|5.0|If we could only live by this 4 agreeements im sure life, the world and everything would be different, ... great great book
B003G4W49C|4.0|Even the second time I couldn't put it down. An unlikely hero saving mankind from certain destruction. It's amazing child's play that is not a children's story. Amazingly done. I hope the movie is as well done as the book. Bravo Mr. Card!
B00ET2ODX0|4.0|The information on the Amazon website indicates a running time of 130 minutes which is the running time of the Hong Kong version.  The Weinstein US version was dramatically shorter at around 108 minutes.  The two versions are different with some scenes added to the 108 minute version and some dramatic chopping of the Hong Kong 130 minute version to get to 108 minutes.  In other words, neither of the two versions is complete.  It is likely that the Amazon information on this release is incorrect.  I would wait until this is sorted out before ordering.  So if one wants a more complete version of The Grandmaster, then one would have to buy both versions.  The director, Wong Kar Wai, is never finished in terms of editing the film.  So that the theatrical release in the US was the Weinstein Bros version and that is a lot simpler than the more complex version that came out of Hong Kong.  But both versions would be able to stand on their own.

B00DAXXO98|5.0|While certainly extreme, it does give an insight into what is possible with political power.  The fact that power corrupts is not a matter of artistic license.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I liked Red2 better.  I watched Red afterward, and enjoyed it--I was laughing out loud at several points.  If you like Red2 then RED is definitely worth a viewing, so you won't feel like you've missed anything.

Who is Doctor Who?<br />You want to start with the 2005 Season 1 to get a hold of all that Pinterest buzz about Daleks, sonic screwdrivers, TARDIS and Doctor's quotes that I could not stand anymore.<br />This series go waaaaay back to the 60s, but you do not need to see the old ones since they rebooted the series with this 2005, a way to get new gens into it, and it works. Do not compare it to todays spacial effects, though: get into the mood and remember it will go on getting better and better until last season.<br />You do not want to see 5 whole seasons to get up to speed?

The rest is requiered to understand all going on...but I promise you will love it. TTFN!<br />[...]
0316204366|3.0|I generally enjoy Malcolm Gladwell's writing, and have read his other books.  I've also heard him speak, watched his TED talk on &#34;David and Goliath,&#34; and read recent interviews he's given about the book.  I say all that, to make it clear that I'm a Gladwell fan, and wanted to love this book.  Sadly, it's not a great read.<br /><br />The title story is interesting, but I think the author would like for readers to be surprised by David's skill and ability.  Most of what he writes about David will be pretty familiar to Christians who have been actively studied the Bible.  Certainly nothing he said about David and/or Goliath was controversial, and most of it could be gleaned from the notes in a good Study Bible.<br /><br />The stories that follow in the first section, and even the second section, are also interesting.  It's thought-provoking to consider that a perceived disadvantage might spur a person on to do exceptional things. As the book continues on, the stories are less exceptional, and the premise less exciting.<br /><br />For me, the book failed on three counts:<br />1.  The stories used to illustrate Gladwell's point failed to consider the negative side.  Yes, a percentage of people when faced with adversity overcome it, however, an overwhelming majority suffer greatly.  For every successful businessperson with a learning disability, there are several more who are in menial jobs.  The same is true of most of all the other examples in the book.<br />2.  The examples given in the third section of the book were simply not compelling.  Maybe an interesting newspaper or magazine article, but not compelling on a &#34;Gladwell-ian&#34; scale.<br />3.  The author failed to connect the examples given into an obvious conclusion, and no effort was given to purport one for the reader.  Maybe the weakness of the last section was the cause of this, but after I put the book down, my only thought was, &#34;so what?&#34;<br /><br />Gladwell is still a fine story-teller, and I think he was on to something good here.  It just didn't come together like it might have.  If you're considering this book because you've heard about Malcolm Gladwell and this is his newest offering, I'd suggest reading Outliers or Tipping Point instead.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It works okay, but many videos are jerky and the video and sound are often not sync'd and I still haven't figure out how to get it to work with all of my devices, laptop, two tablets, and android phone.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Just awful. This app takes forever to load, if it even bothers to load at all, it freezes up, and you can't find your likes and favorites. To be fair, on the rare occasions when it works, the picture quality is good, but I expect that from my Kindle anyway.<br /><br />You're far better off just watching YouTube in your browser.

B001BKG9SK|5.0|Excellent Gilmour concert the best that I've seen thus far. It will inspire you. There is a &#34;glitch&#34; on the DVD concert disc, whereas the disc stops playing a couple of minutes into the song &#34;Echoes&#34;. It will not recover and requires a &#34;skip&#34; to the next song followed by a reverse/rewind back into the song at the place it stopped to view the remainder. The other three discs, DVD and CDs are fine.<br />I have no plans to return it ....not worth the hassle.
B004W25KKW|5.0|It is personal, entertaining and technical at the same time. Thank you for sharing your short and sweet mnemonic journal :)
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The title is appropriate for the book.  The story lines are much darker than in the first book.  It's still a great read, but be ready for some surprises.
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|While visually pleasing, this version of Gatsby is an atrocity in every other way.<br /><br />They could not have chosen a worse soundtrack - I mean, this is the 1920s, and they're playing hip hop and rap? They were clearly going for a \\"Knight's Tale\\"-style approach, but they failed miserably. Watching the flappers dancing to Jay-Z and Andre 3000 literally made my jaw drop in horror and shock. Completely ruined the 1920s atmosphere in every scene with modern tunes.<br /><br />Cary Mulligan is adorable and likeable... she completely fails to capture Daisy's lofty carelessness and arrogance. As for Leonardo DiCaprio, who is an amazingly talented actor, he was badly miscast as well. He was, I fear, too old and serious. He simply does not portray young Jay Gatsby's naivete and optimism, and those are his most important qualities! Toby Maguire is the only one who seemed to fit his role.<br /><br />The story plods along and does not entice or reel you in. I found it to be overly lengthy and not entirely true to the book. There were a lot of pointless and neverending close-ups of raindrops, leaves, wine glasses... just about every inanimate, insignificant object they used on that set got some quality time with the camera, and then, of course, they shorten the characters' scenes - because the LAST thing they wanted was to cut back on those 5-minute artistic stills.<br /><br />The movie is, overall, a huge disappointment and 2 hours I will never get back. The people who made it clearly thought they were making a masterpiece and they overshot every aspect of this film, which should have been great, but was drastically exploited in the name of cinematic art. I'd rather go to the dentist and have teeth pulled than sit through this bastardized version of a classic novel again.
B00FVS3RZQ|5.0|I have cable but it is so frustrating to watch this show with 20 minutes of commercials. Literally every 5 there are 2 minutes of commercials. Ugh, so frustrating! I love being able to watch here and stop and start when I like. Great show. Awesome story. The new showrunner is the guy who wrote the episode &#34;clear&#34; so I am expecting more character development for everyone and less misogyny in the form of poor female characters who have little to offer besides poor decision making, sex, cooking, washing and whining.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|I love this game!! Very challenging! It provides hours of entertainment and strain on the brain!

B00DAPOHU6|3.0|Some years ago, Jack Johnson's fans (including me) had been started to feel the weary repetition of musical elements in his songs. Now, I think \\"I got you\\" video is explicit about this situation: we can see Jack singing with the same attitude and the same clothes but different colours and different situations/places. That's all: since 15 years we are hearing the same song with different lyrics and into different albums...<br /><br />Musical repetition is not necessarily bad. It could be cool too. I.E.: Vivaldi wrote the same concerto a hundred times... but he was inventing a structure!!! Dylan also repeats himself... but he is the King of Lyrics!!! South American singer-songwriter Violeta Parra did repeat herself... but in order to recover Chilean folk music!!! Salsa singer Gilberto Santa-Rosa repeats himself once and again ... but in order to link his music with Latin musical genres, so different one from each other...<br /><br />And what about Jack Johnson? He is in the middle of nowhere.  He wants to invent (unnecessarily) his own social-American-indie song. He wants to be a sort of Dylan (!!!) and recover something like a musical genre (something that is still alive: the troubadour song). Anyway, I think he sounds a little bit tired, and we get tired hearing him. \\"From here to now to you\\" is good to `johnsonliebers': beautiful songs, nice music, ecological intentions, and good vibes. Everything is so proper and this is the other big problem (in addition to the musical repetition): too much `Zen', too much sugar in this marmalade. This album is still bearable, but don't be afraid if the next Jack's song is dedicated to Paulo Coelho...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Since giving up my Directv and watching everything through streaming media, I've sometimes had trouble finding good shows to watch.  I was pleasantly surprised with this witty dramedy lawyer series.  It's sleek and smart and fun to watch.

B00F91RYL8|2.0|This brief review is more than knowing I'd have a story and performance bar set from 3 years of watching The Walking Dead.<br />Its more than that.<br />The story is contrived around a UN operative(Pitt), of whose former role at that organization, is never clear. However: helicopters, airplanes and human life are at Pitt's disposal as he hunches his way around a dissolving human race. Everybody likes him, no one questions him... must be like being married to Angelina<br />While the movie begins in The City of Brotherly Love, Phillie... then surprisingly moves-on to Newark, New Jersey; of all places.... (not the first city i would chose to traverse as the dead start walking and biting... where are these characters from? Not Pennsylvania.. They must be following a gps and not good sense.... might as well just get a room in downtown Camden.) but no association with any US forces occur. Instead in this P.C. tale; we are to believe that the 'UN fleet' safe off New York is running the show amid the chaos. The New World Order steps up to bat against the Zombie Apocalypse and comes off as contrived and undefined as the Socialism that supports it. It's like counting on the French and their leadership; only 'times 2'...<br />Pitt rises above all the sacrificial death and destruction that is put-out in support of his inane quest. Again... it all just seems like a day in the life of a spoiled brat(brad), getting his own zombie movie.<br />I truly hoped this would not  happen, I so wanted a cool zombie movie... So will you....<br />Cheers and good-luck mate!
030726999X|5.0|I loved the trilogy and have recommended it to many friends who have loved it as much as I. I could not put the book down once I started. In the beginning you have to get used to the Swedish names and who is who, which was confusing. I almost stopped reading it, but I continued and eventually I was able to figure out the good guys from the bad guys, etc.

B00C0NFMKI|3.0|...the rest of the album is just 'okay'.<br /><br />Not their best stuff, in my opinion.<br /><br />There's really only one other song on here that's memorable (Hate to See Your Heart Break).

0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games is a great book that people of all ages will enjoy. It is the first book in the series out of three. I think that the storyline is very well written and quite realistic and easy to understand. The Hunger Games is an event that one boy and one girl attend from each district. The main character, Katniss, is put into a drawing to enter The Hunger Games. Katniss ends up being chosen from District 12 after she volunteered for her sister, Prim, who was originally selected. Peeta was selected from the large group of boys for District 12. Katniss and Peeta are then sent off to start training for The Hunger Games.<br /> The Hunger Games is a life or death situation and there is only one winner out of twelve districts. Each person has a special talent or weapon that they use to their advantage in the games. Katniss' special weapon is the bow and arrow and it comes in good use to her multiple times. Katniss and Peeta are trained by a former Hunger games winner, Haymitch, and then the Games begin. It is a very aggressive and competitive battle against people from every district. Overall I think that the Hunger Games is an excellent book for different reading levels and for anyone over seven. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a fast pace action book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is very good, it is also very fun to play it has an interesting concept. All in all i would tell others that this game has no problems and does not stop running.

B001AX9DSQ|5.0|Ray LaMontagne is just soulful and has a beautifully different tone. The album moves you, is fun and makes you feel good to know it exists.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Satisfying read on many levels: flawed characters, relevant social situations, powerful lessons. A bit predictable but the ending and epilogue made up for it. Will read more by this author.
B00FA5MU58|4.0|This is the best they have sounded in over 20 years,vocals and instrumental. Orion is worth the price alone! Great Live Album!
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|I had such high hopes for this movie - I like the director, and many of the actors, and really liked the book a lot.  And some things were good - I liked the use of classical music woven in with more contemporary music, and I thought the acting of the main characters was pretty good. But the movie just dragged after about the first 20 minutes, until the climax where it picked up again.  If you're interested in Gatsby, just read the book - it's much, much better than this film.
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|All in all Joan at her best.  Had the hard edged rock & roll she<br />Has always been known for.  Good job Joan.
B00DU6UD0I|5.0|I laughed so hard during this that I missed half the little quips and jokes that are in it. I had to watch it 3 times to catch everything. If you love this movie like I did, you'll love Undercover Brother, another great spoof film.
B00FPH6AXE|1.0|This awful piece of dog poo disappeared from the theaters so quickly.  What a pathetic Stage Mother Will Smith is.<br /><br />Will:  Your kid can't act.  He comes off like a whiner.  And his voice is annoying.<br /><br />Gary Whitta:  Loved The Book of Eli.  Go write the sequel.  The father-son relationship and the dialogue in this one were yucky.<br /><br />M Night: perhaps time to give up directing?  Where did your  talent disappear to?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's addictive and fun. Definitely stimulates the gray cells. However, there should be a certain percentage of free hints before having to pay.
B00FEJIVRQ|4.0|really enjoyed Iron Man 3, got really into it and was even emotional haha :) can't wait to watch it again
B0058FW06Y|2.0|Emily Browning and the other actresses attractiveness notwithstanding, This movie is all show and no story. I wanted to love it, watched it knowing it would probably be what it was based upon critical reviews and friends' summaries, hoped they would be proven wrong, but they were not. The fight scenes were good... Did I mention that Emily Browning is attractive?
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|this game is so much fun and is really addicting. I would recommend this to anyone. it will keep you entertained for hours
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am a recent fan of David Baldacci and am working my way through his many books. Zero Day like Baldacci's other books is riveting and suspenseful and is hard to put down once you start. I look forward to opening another one of his books!!
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This is a fun app that my grandchildren like to play.  The main drawback is that one cannot play the game to an extended period of time.  The short time associated with the free demo (15 minutes) doesn't allow enough time to really &#34;get&#34; into the game.  But then I guess if one if marketing the game, this is an incentive to buy it.  The programer clearly states it's a demo.

B00F8MI9NK|4.0|Sequels are usually a little less than the first movie, but this one was really cute. Definitely a must see if you are a Monsters, Inc. or Disney fan.
B009K86D86|5.0|If all the people in the US watched this movie, the food industry would be turned upside down.  It is appalling what is done in the name of profit.  Folks beware of the food you put on your table.  KNOW your Farmer, KNOW where that food came from and how it was made.

0345803485|5.0|A little bit scary !!  But couldn't put it down.  Had to find out where it was going, then found out there were 2 more books in the trilogy.  Glad I continued to read all of them, cause the very very end is worth every page I read.
B008YW5RH2|4.0|This game is awesome  and it works fine - for a little while... after a few days, it just won't open. Then I delete it and redownload it and it works fine. Then everything starts over again. I think this game is a winner, except for that issue.
0345803493|5.0|A little bit scary, but couldn't put it down.  Had to find out where this story was going.  Suspense and anticipation of the next book.

B00C8RBP6Q|4.0|Even though this movie has received its fair share of scathing reviews, I must say I enjoyed it. I read the book [[ASIN:B000PGNDM6 The Club Dumas]] by Arturo Perez-Reverte, and yes, the movie does not do justice to the book, nevertheless I found the movie to be entertaining. Johnny Depp is famous for playing understated roles, and here he plays the ruthless book dealer Corso with a measure of indifference, and yet, his character sucks you into the plot as he ventures deeper into a web of deceit and evil. Frank Langella's Boris Balkan is intellectual and possessed of a greed for forbidden things. Lena Olin as the 'grieving widow' with devilish designs is sexy as always, but nothing more. I found the character of the 'guardian angel' who is always getting Depp out of trouble [played by Polanski's wife Emmanuelle Seigner] to be the most intriguing; her unnerving glances hint at something more sinister under the surface.<br /><br />This is a story about one man's (Corso) search for a forbidden text, and this search (Balkan tasks Corso with authenticating an ancient occult book purported to be authored by the devil himself) takes Corso to some very dark and dangerous places. The score is worthy of mention as the unsettling music is not only haunting but makes one get the feeling there are malevolent forces at work. Although some reviews found the movie to be plodding, I didn't. Corso's quest takes him into a dark, forbidding world filled with devil worshipers, and a stranger who holds the real key to all his questions. Like another reviewer states here, be careful when purchasing the DVD as not all of them contain a sex scene featuring Depp and Seigner, and this scene is absolutely necessary for understanding the full meaning of the story itself, so be sure to check with the retailer before purchasing the DVD. Other than that, I'd recommend this to fans of occult thrillers.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I have no complaints about this watch - it looks great and isn't heavy.  I would highly recommend it.  Thanks.
B00E8KC5HY|5.0|Overview<br />What Rene has achieved here is a very deeply felt, flowing and dramatic interpretation.<br /><br />Technical Specifications:<br />Recorded Edited and mixed with Merging Technologies Horus and Pyramix<br />Recorded at 96kHz/24 bit with 32 microphones connected to Horus<br />Recording Venue: Teldex Studios, Berlin<br />Recording Dates: August and September 2012<br /><br />Recording<br />When I first got this SACD set, I first looked at the recording venue used. When I saw it was the Teldex studio Berlin, I thought \\"oh no, why didn't they use a church?!\\". However, my disappointment quickly evaporated as I listened to the first few minutes and discovered the most gorgeous MULTI-CHANNEL sound of the St. Matthew Passion yet recorded. The sound is detailed, warm and spacious at the same time with a nice reverberation time of about 3 seconds which makes it sound as if it was recorded in a church. For the SACD multi-channel sound, Rene has decided to place Choir I (24), Orch I (23) and Soloists I in the front and closer to the listener and a smaller slightly more distant sounding Choir II (12), smaller Orch II (14) and Soloists II in the rear. This was done in a similar way in the SACD multi-channel recording by The Netherlands Bach Society, except, this recording sounds warmer, more luxurious and more detailed. This is similar to how Bach would have performed it in St. Thomas Church with it's two organ lofts at opposite ends of the Nave. By the way, the main organ loft is large enough to hold a multi per part medium choir and medium size orchestra, and the smaller organ and loft which used to exist are small and would only be able to hold a dozen to 18 people, so I question the \\"one person per part\\" research that claims that Bach would still only have one person per part, especially on large important occasions such as Easter when the Passions would have been performed. I have given the MULTI-CHANNEL version 5 stars. However, in this recording the STEREO SACDand CD layer versions, group I and group II both sound from the 2 front stereo speakers but they are not placed left and right, both choirs, orchestras and soloists come from the left and right speakers but group II is softer and more distant so that is the only way you can differentiate them. In my opinion this was a mistake by the HM artistic director, as it makes for a somewhat unsatisfying stereo recording of this work. However, upon re-listening to this in plain stereo, the sound is very good indeed and the more distant group II does work. That is why I have raised the stereo version recorded quality from 3 to 4 stars.<br /><br />Performance<br />Rene's interpretation of Bach's St. Matthew Passion is in the same tradition of Leonhardt's DHM recording, Gardiner's recording and what little drama there was in the Harnoncourt's recording (specifically the storm Chorus No. 27b \\"Sind Blitze, sind Donner\\" were Harnoncourt starts softly and builds the volume, Rene does it much better with more tension and drama and that wonderful reverberation during the pause), which use medium size multiple persons per part choirs, Boy's Choir and original instrument orchestras, no single person per part here. Rene takes the delicacy of Leonhardt's DHM recording in which Rene Jacobs sang the Alto part except with more drama where needed. Rene's orchestra, The Academy for Ancient Music Berlin sounds gorgeous. Berhard Forch, the leader, gives us some enchanting violin solos. Rene adds a lute and harpsichord in the array of continuo instruments in addition to the organ, cello and viola da gamba. The other instrumental soloists are of very high quality. The vocal soloists in general are of high quality too. Werner Gura is a very good Evangelist that portrays the story with delicacy and depth. Johannes Weisser is an unusual choice for Jesus. In the documentation he is listed as a Bass, but when listening to him sing he is definitely a baritone. His portrayal of Jesus is more sensitive anddelicate than most others which use a strong commanding style. At first I was taken aback with this different style, because I was so used to the deep authoritative style of others. Come to think about it, when I first heard the St. Matthew Passion about 40 years ago, I was taken aback in the opposite way in that I never thought Jesus should sound so commanding and deep. I commend Johannes Weisser for taking a different approach here and it really works well. Bernarda Fink, as usual, gives us a wonderful alto. Sunhae Im gives a somewhat weak and uneven toned performance as the Soprano I. She has a pleasant voice but her low notes are weak and her vibrato is slightly uncontrolled. Also, her voice is slightly drowned out by the wind instruments now and then during the soft passages. My favorite soprano for the two Soprano I arias are Emma Kirkby (on a CD/DVD combo released by House of Classics from a 1993 live recording from King's College Cambridge with the Brandenburg Consort) and Christine Schäfer (from Harnoncourt's 2001 Teldec recording). I will not get into the remaining details of the work because I urge you to discover the drama and beauty yourself, except for one that I feel compelled to comment on; the performance of No. 65 \\"Mache dich, mein Herze, rein\\" (sung by Konstatin Wolff, bass-baritone) that comes after Jesus death is the most beautiful I have ever heard. Overall, I have given the performance a little above 4-1/2 stars.<br /><br />Extras<br />At the end of SACD 2 there is a second version of the recitative and Aria for Bass Nos. 56 & 57 with the viola da Gamba replacing the lute. Both are absolutely gorgeous and moving to the soul!<br /><br />Extra DVD<br />The extra DVD is an interesting documentary on Rene's and the other performers' interpretation of the work that lasts for 46 minutes.<br /><br />Booklet<br />I usually do not comment on the booklet, but I had to say that the English translation from the original German libretto is the worst I have ever read. Many errors occur throughout the text. However, Rene Jacobs essay on Bach's St. Matthew Passion is easy to read, intriguing, very informative, and enlightening.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />I highly recommend this recording especially in SACD MULTI-CHANNEL Surround sound. Rene and Harmonia Mundi has given us a deeply moving, beautifully nuanced, and flowing performance that you just don't want to end. Overall I would rate the performance at 4.5 stars and the multi-channel recording at 4.8 stars, so that would average it up to 5 stars on Amazon's rating system.

B003M6OW4Y|5.0|This series was enjoyable. The premise of how the richest people can take advantage of those who don't have as much is the norm in all society. I was hoping the series would have been able to continue to show the future results in more details.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|Good starter app ... but you'll want to purchase the 'real' app from the manufacturer.  Though this gives you a fun toy, it becomes old quickly.

B0084670FU|1.0|It's not really wise to pepper a movie that could have been much better with four letter words and showing a young man of maybe 12 years old masturbating. Gross and Nasty.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I am only 65% through the book.  I've read all the previous books, so I'm taking my time with this one.  The time line is supposed to be the same as the previous books but written from different characters' points of view - But I've just read chapters from Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark, so that time line is still being expanded. Some characters seem to die in one book, only to find out that they have managed to survive - which is fine by me, because I don't want all the not-so-terrible characters to die quiet yet!<br /><br />Since this is such a long book (over 1,000 pages?) I bought a Kindle edition, when I purchased it the Amazon message said something about being able to download it to more than one device.  I did not do it at that moment and when I tried to figure out how that could be done - I wasn't able to find it. I would have liked to put a copy on my desk-top at work, as well as on my Kindle.

B008ROF114|3.0|You know what is worth seeing in this movie?  A young Angie Dickinson. Gorgeous!  And she falls for John Wayne?  Only in a John Wayne movie.  Dean Martin is in this movie and when you first see him, he's got his shirt opened very wide in the upper chest area.  Hmm.  He sings towards the end of the movie.  Oh! And he sings with Ricky Nelson, who must have been cast for the teen girls.  He's cute.  It's OK.  Especially, if you've never seen a Western or its been a very long time and you have nothing else to do.<br /><br />I saw it for Free on my Amazon Prime Membership.  I wouldn't have paid to see it.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I've actually read this book and have updated my review accordingly. the first time I read the book I found it very slow and meandering compared to the previous installments. However having decided to give it another chance I realized that I was a little hasty in my judgement. The book though not as good as the first three is still beautifully written and the Reek story line in particular is touching. can't help thinking the ending was a bit of a let down but then we do have the next book still to come!
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|This book helped me remember those feelings I had long ago when I was young.  There is truly nothing like first love and the author takes you on a journey of the heart.  Loved it!
B000FCKGPC|3.0|So this is still a pretty good book. but the first three books in the series were three of the greatest novels ever written. This one is just 'pretty good'. I found it a little slow at times and the fact that it wanders away from the starks is not the best.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I really enjoyed this fascinating look into the Federal Prison system.  I felt like I knew these women and wanted to hear more of their story.  Great read!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Well maybe 'almost as good as game' would be most apt. i found that the dany story line dragged a little but other than that excellent. Tyrion is awesome and this is basically HIS book.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|I think the title of this review says it all. This is no short book but i read it literally in a day and a half. I just couldn't put it down. This is George R.R. Martin's masterpiece
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It feels like the author could read my mind at times when he writes about Pat's neuroticism; and makes the reader question what is normal and what is actually crazy?!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|the book that spawned the series!<br />I don't know what I can say about game of thrones that hasn't been said already, other than I feel like this has already set off a whole new genre of gritty fantasy. Lord of the rings was always my favorite book but I think this is right up there with it. The characters are just so deep and real. Incredible work from an incredible writer
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Besides of being very well written, is very informative on World War I.<br /><br />It makes you live the experiences as an American, British, German and Russian nationalities, before and after the War.<br /><br />This week, I'm starting to read Winter of the World and hopefully when I finish it, the third book of this interesting trilogy will be already on the market.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Is one the of the first free downloads I made to my Kindle. it is a fun and exciting game!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like it but it takes up a lot of space to update. I  think thats really stupid kindle fires should have more space
B00B32YK96|3.0|Thin plot with a nice ending, which comes too late to save the film. Timothy Hutton is flat, Annabeth Gish is radiant in her small role, but the real kicker is Natalie Portman at about age thirteen. Young, and not much polish, but the talent is evident.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Truly exhilarating.  A masterpiece.  I could not put this book down, and I wished for more.  This book kept me thinking long after I turned the final page.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got this game for my iPhone and, while it was entertaining, it was hard to complete levels because of the small screen.  I saw that it was available for the Kindle Fire HD, so I ordered it.  Very entertaining running game with lots of obstacles and different settings from the movie to run through.  I recommend this game to fans of both movies...
B00F35B8F8|3.0|I'm pretty sick of JJ Abrams thinking that Star Trek is his to rewrite as he pleases. Everyone knows that Khan was after the Enterprise's 5 year mission was complete, not before, and that Spock died in the reactor chamber, not Kirk. Unacceptable poetic license.
B001QB9ETK|4.0|I would put this down as a must see film. The acting in this movie is top notch, and the scenery is stunning, but whoever put this film together deserves the fate of the natives. The scenes are choppy, especially the action scenes, and the story doesn't have a flow. How could someone have so much talent and amazing footage, and then slap it together like a child? If I didn't know anything about them, and just saw this movie, I would think first year college students were handed this footage, and put it together as a school project. Appreciate the acting talent, and remind yourself that this is a true story, but I wouldn't recommend buying this movie to add to your collection, unless you are collecting all the works of a specific actor. This is a rental quality film.
B005721Y7Y|4.0|All good.  ;-)<br />What else is there to really say. Good movie with a great cast. Easy to buy with good audio and video playback.
1587143879|4.0|Even better than Wendell Odom's last edition. The one is straight to the point a great resource for students wanting to learn Cisco
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is great u can play it when ur bored and need something 2 do great game and very time consuming
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is an outstanding piece of literature!  It is a very well thought out story, with an unusual structure, that alternately depresses you, makes you laugh, depresses you again, and shocks you.  It is a look at a marriage, with two far from perfect spouses, who have problems, then finally, at the end, &#34;solve&#34; their problems.  You may never want to recommend marriage to anyone after reading this!
B00D48BT5A|5.0|Written with the intricacies of hindsight and a wonderful sense of the absurd, Bryson brings to life events and characters that dominated 1927 in a historically and humorously rich text.  I am an avid Bryson fan, have read all his books and have most as keepers and 1927 would rank very high indeed.  I heartily recommend it.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|Scott Lynch does an admirable job of world-building for this monster of a story, and thankful he managed to do it without sacrificing the characters. Unlike many authors who set their world up before really getting into the story and giving their characters depth, Lynch admirably managed to fairly seamlessly blend all three.<br /><br />Though the story begins with Locke as a youth, it doesn't remain linear for its entire length. Instead we switch between past and present, but not through the more common method of flashbacks. Instead the switch is just that simple, though of course the timing is impeccable, with the shifts in time offering necessary information just when it's most needed. Though there is some action in the beginning, much of it is more focused on world-building and character development, yet it never seems to feel as if it is moving too slowly.<br /><br />By the time the full-on action is introduced you are in too deep to do anything but proceed forward, with caution, trepidation, and a whole heap of excitement. Well deserved excitement I might add. The entire book builds toward the culmination found in the final chapters, and has more twists and turns than an eighty-year-old doorknob in a popular hotel. Of course I think that at least half the excitement from the action is due to how Lynch manages to get you to care for the characters, and become emotionally invested in their physical and mental well-being. One sign of just how well he manages to pull this off is the way you find your sympathies going to Locke and friends rather than the innocent victims of their scams.<br /><br />Again I found that switching between past and present was not only informative - with just the right information at the right time - but also an excellent device to help maintain the suspense and excitement at any given point in the game, or in their lives. Though this book is lengthy it is well worth sticking with it, as Lynch manages to pull off one surprise after another. By the end I found myself relieved to have a break on the characters' behalf, but also ready to see what mischief they will get into next.
0786838655|4.0|I thought the Lightning Thief was a great book.  It is about Percy Jackson who is a 12 year old trouble-maker. He has to go to boarding school, and while at school he meets his friend named Grover. On the first day of summer break, Percy and his mom go to a cabin on the beach. When they get to the cabin, weird things start to happen. The next thing they know Grover is half goat and they are driving away from a Minotaur. The Minotaur kills Percy's mom and then Percy kills the Minotaur. Percy then wakes up at camp Half-Blood. At camp Percy learns that his dad is Poseidon, king of the sea. He also learns that Zeus's master bolt is stolen and Zeus is blaming Poseidon. He realized it is Percy's job to find the bolt. Percy thinks the bolt is in the Underworld. On the \\"quest\\" Percy brings his friend Grover and Annabeth (from camp half-blood). The three of them travel across the country to go to Los Angeles, where the underworld is located. Along the way they fight Medusa and many other monsters. They also meet Ares, god of war, who tricks them and makes them take longer to get to the underworld. When they finally get to the underworld they realize Hades (god of the underworld) doesn't have the bolt. Actually, Hades lost his Helm of Darkness. When Percy is talking to Hades the bolt appears in Percy's backpack. When the three escape Hades they find Ares on the beach they find out that Ares stole the bolt and the Helm of Darkness. Percy and Ares fight and Percy wins the Helm of Darkness. Percy returns the Helm to Hades and flies to the Empire State Building to give the bolt to Zeus.  Then when they get there, Percy meets Poseidon, his dad and Zeus. He returns the bolt and warns Zeus that Kronos the King of Titans wants to start a war, but Zeus doesn't listen. When Percy returns to camp Half-Blood he has to make a decision to stay or go home. Then on the last day of summer Luke tells Percy he's stolen the bolt and the Helm of Darkness and has given them to Ares. Luke then tries to kill Percy and disappears. Percy then decides to go home and live with his stepdad.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|Shaun the Sheep is a creative and funny animated series. They exploit the foibles of man through these entertaining barnyard animals.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Reading is my addiction.  I always finish a book, regardless. I become one with the characters. The book is well written. You will feel the emotions that are intended. I was happy it ended, it was torturous to read and I'm sorry I gave in to all the hype.  I had no idea what the books were about.  I had heard they were racey, but never imagined I would be introduced to a world that I don't want to know.
B006UUK612|4.0|I grew up with it, and watched until the tape wore out, great movie for its time, especially for kids
B00103584Y|4.0|This is a classic that never gets old. The 3 alternate scenarios make the story interesting and shows how life can turn on a dime.
B005NFJAMG|3.0|It was a good movie, and was glad to see it on blu-ray.  I was actually kind of happy that Segal wasn't in most of the movie.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Love how it brought the book alive! The scenes where as chaotic as the time it was based off of.
B00371QQ0M|3.0|It's nice to have Dune back on my shelf, but I thought it would include some of the cut scenes I remember seeing when I was a kid. It doesn't
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|great movie! 3d rocks! loved the new take on the series story line using original spin offs star trek forever!
B005LAIISU|4.0|I didn't like it at first, but it kind of grows on you.  Hopefully, it's the last of the series, I think it would be too much if they came out with any more.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I think this show is amazing and it keeps getting better. Too bad they cancelled it. There some episodes similar too Stargate Sg1 through out the series but I thoughtbit was pretty neat the was they tied it in with guest appearances.
B009UWYFFK|4.0|Great concept for a movie for kids.  I think it was well done, though the voice acting on the lead actress left us wanting
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Found the third in the trilogy to be the worst.  It was at best confusing & hard to follow what was happening.  I liked the first two books much better.
B000FA675C|4.0|The Davinci Code was well written, as well as the rest of the books in the series, though the romance  seemed a little forced.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great movie!  Lots of action and good character development.  It is a classic.  Will be watched and re-watched many times.
B007KUFDBY|4.0|It doesn't quite follow the traditional storyline, but I believe it was well put together, and worth showing the kids.
8866135887|5.0|Very Sturdy, yet stylish.  Leather wears very well; plenty of space for appointments; contacts, etc.  Will purchase another one next year!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|I don't get how harsh people are on some movies, I guess if you are Will Smith everything has to be a blockbuster or it will get a bad review. It is a servicable sci-fi film that anyone into such movies should be able to enjoy. Yes there are some \\"huh?\\" moments like when the kid goes through tons of trauma yet manages without a scratch the entire film it seems....including the crash itself. Then there is the wtf bird scene, will never get that one. If you can get past a few things you should be able to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Will Smith's kid's acting in this movie is not near as bad as people make it out to be. My new rule...if something has mixed reviews on Amazon I am going to watch the movie anyway. Far too many overly critical people here.
086571701X|5.0|I am new to aquaponic systems.  This book is excellent to help you get started. It answers many questions that youtube does not.
B00BIK06JG|5.0|Most of the time I am not using my camera it is stored on a shelf, so the case is pointless.  On long trips however the extra protection is appreciated.  I like knowing the camera is covered/safe to protect it from drops, hits, etc.  But when it is being used for a long period of time it is in my hand, and the case just sits idle.  It would be nice if there was some provision on the case to attach it to your pants/belt since it does not collapse and then you have this big molded case that you have to lug around somehow... sort of a PITA.....<br /><br />The strap is great.  Neck straps scream 'tourist' and just don't work that well for me.  However, the hand-strap is really nice as it gives a sense of firmness and security when holding the camera.  Really happy with it--- Sony as always makes a great quality product.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have loved all three of these books in the series and look forward to more and continuing drama with these characters.
1452126577|5.0|If you like grumpy cat, you'll enjoy this book.  It really is simple, doesn't have a whole lot of content, and for the price you're probably wasting your money.  But it is a good gift for the GC-lover, and just a silly grouping of photos, sayings, etc.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you might even throw up in your mouth a bit.  But that might be a good thing... who knows!
B007WFR0QS|5.0|It's rare that I like so many songs from one CD by a single artist. She has exceptional vocal talent and is severely underrated. I hope to see more of songs from her in the future!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie not what you may expect. Family watched it twice and was just as interesting.  A must see for monie bufffs
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|So cute. Very much like the original, with it's own cute and interesting twist. Nicely created and very enjoyable. Love it.
B003YVLC18|4.0|Pretty decent chick flick. Drew Barrymore's attempt at an accent is terrible...along with her acting in general. But that accent...geeze
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Its a very simple product, and works great. It's very easy to set up and use. Wish have more app working with. The major flw it's the impossibility to stream local contents like pictures and music saved in your computer (you can, but you need to do using your chrome browse, but, this kill the idea of simplicity). Any way, if you want stream Netflix and YouTube, you can't get wrong with thi little thing.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|This movie not only touches on the bond of family, but also the importance of living in the present moment.  Both Will and Jayden are right on.  The scenery is also amazing- sorry I missed it on the big screen.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I  will forever miss Vince Flynn and his excitement and entertainment! The last man is all of that and more!
B009CF3P7E|5.0|But I am a star trek fan...the new ones are fun with the new actors.  Thanks trekked for the come back
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|I didn't read the comic, but this was weak compared to the precious Iron Man movies.  They used too many suites, thus degrading the power of any given suite.
B000I55YV2|5.0|The action starts immediately and accelerates thru the rest of the movie; no falling asleep is allowed in this flick.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|This is one of my FAVORITE Disney movies! It arrived on time and just as advertised. The discs were in excellent condition. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should DEFINITELY check it out. It has a strong female lead in the protagonist role, and features delightful music and fun content. I love this movie, this story, and the lessons that it teaches.
B00008WT5E|5.0|The remaster is awesome,the music is louder . The picture booklet is really cool, all the old shots of Bon. He is sadly missed.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|I am not sure if John Wayne ever made a movie that I didn't like. I was not aware that he made this movie. I decided to view it and again John Wayne did his usual great acting job. The supporting cast was also very good. The story was a little weak, but it was still entertaining. To me these older movies are good family entertainment. You can enjoy them as a family without worrying about Sex, Violence, and bad language.
B00008BXJG|5.0|The remaster is awesome,the music is louder. The picture booklet is really cool. The old photos of Bon are fantastic. He is sadly missed,truly one of the best front men.
B009BJAPLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two seasons of this series. In my opinion, it is by far the best BBC series currently airing. In fact, I'm re-watching it right now to prepare for the third.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love love love, back to book three for second time!!!! Dort dirt chick chock hook hock cort Lotr dirt dirt coy boy
B008J05EL8|1.0|I haven't had a problem with any apps that I've purchased up until now.Was very disappointed and upset with several attempts to open the app and each time failed.I've notified Amazon about the problem and request that they take that app OFF line so No one else gets scammed out of their money.In hopes that they refunded people or to fix the app and resend it back to us in working order..<br />PS the real rate on that app is scam..
B000002GYW|5.0|This album stands the test of time. I have worn out two vinyl records and one CD. Randy Miesner at his best!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so fun I have to be honest it's amazing and sups fun for every one I loved it
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series.  Enjoy it commercial free when and where I want to watch it.  Looking forward to watching new seasons.
B00F87ZUYG|2.0|i paid for the episode and now can not watch it.. it only plays the sound, no visual... very disappointing :(
B001N4RORE|5.0|Love the movie? Great performance . I was amazed at the talent of entire cast. A must see movie for entire Family.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This is a great series Ive learned new words as well to describe evil greedy people that try to suck from the poor
B0002EXH5O|3.0|Its been some time ago that I listened to this on cassette. After having listened to the remastered version, something was off. The vocals seemed off. After finding out that the vocals were redone, I realized thats what it had fo be. Its for this reason, I give this version 3 stars. Why fix something that wasn't broken? If you wanted to remaster what could arguably be one of the best metal albums of the late 80's early 1990, fine. But to go to these lengths to redo the vocals was just down right weird.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I LOVE DOODLE JUMP, IT HAS AMAZING THEMES AND IT'S OWN LITTLE SHOP TO BUY POWERUPS. I'LL ALWAYS LOVE DOODLE JUMP.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lean In is a great book -- a must read for all in the business world. Important information for everyone.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Sugar Sugar is a really fun game, but I'm stuck on a level somewhere in the twenties. It can be a little challenging at some times.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I loved the way Piper Kerman presented prison life.  This was not just another &#34;I was treated unjustly&#34;.  It was the story of a brave acceptance of a wrong and growth through the consequences.  It gave me an enitrely new persepctive on the community life that can be created in prison.  I found it totally enlightening.
1451638450|4.0|I found this latest installment of the Vorkosigan series rather enjoyable and very Ivan-like. Not too much going on and the main aim of the titular character is to keep his head above the water not to dive in and make the biggest splash, the way Miles would do it. From the plot point of view there are large sections of the book where there is little plot advancement but they are the parts that I actually like re-reading as they offer wonderfull windows on the other recurring characters from in the series, all from Ivan/Tej's point of view. If you read the previous books and recognize the references you are going to enjoy them, if you do not, then this may be a totally boring 1/3 of the book.<br />Where the plot gets going it becomes a regular convoluted Vorkosigan-style affair. I enjoyed the first plot a lot more than the final one. Yes, I feel like these are almost completely separate lines, even though they are related in the book. The big break in action in the middle kind of makes them separate. The second plot line is somewhat interesting but having the opponent show up in the last 50 pages of the book does not allow for any kind of emotional build up. I guess this is my biggest disappointment of the book.<br />I would recommend this to someone who likes the series and charcters but definitely not as an entry point into the series.
B000VX1CGC|5.0|These are my favorite shoes. I have been wearing this version for about 30 years. The glove leather inside is what makes them special. The quality seems has not seemed to go down much over the years - I think the leather used to be water-proofed. I insert 1/4&#34; barbed brass plugs in the small holes in the heels so I don't wear the heals too quickly.<br /><br />The ones I received are made in Haiti. In the past they have come from various countries. This par seems very well-made - straight with no defects in the stitching.<br /><br />One problem I have had over the years is separation of the upper from the welt. I wish there was some remedy to this.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought it might be a &#34;boiler plate&#34; in the initial pages but then it took many twists and turns.  It's extremely well written and a page turner of suspense.  You'll enjoy this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am totally addicted to this puzzle game.  As a senior citizen, I'm always looking for things that make me think.  Some of the puzzles are easy and some are downright mind bending.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|love amzon prime.  there is a really good selection. my wife and I watch every night: even if we have seen it before.<br />we like about 90% of the movies we have seen.(if you don't like a \\"pick\\" choose another)<br />amazon prime Is the best of all other movie watching online services. trust me you can watch 1000's for free and you have the choice of (\\"i don't know how many 10,000?\\") paying for one (roughly: 1.99 -4.99)  you just have to see Now. we love it!<br />and plan on using for years to come.<br />~craig<br /><br />Sorry everybody but reviewing all we watch is impossible and time consuming. ~
B00594XOZU|1.0|I have been able to use kik messenger on my kindle for months and now it won't let me log in it just says this is taking to long please try again in a bit and i do that but it still doesn't log in!!!!! It makes me so frustrated when tuis happens please fix it!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I wasn't sure about taking on this challenging game but I'm glad I did, cause I worked on these by myself, after each puzzle was solved I was woo proud of myself cause these puzzles stretch my imagination. great fun thanks!
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|Its the song that most of us women can say Oh that's my song. Most women feel that their man thinks this way but never never  could say it this way. I love this made me cry the first 6 times I heard it. Now I can listen with just misty eyes.
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Worth seeing but not worth owning. Tarantino has given it the entertaining and edgy twist that only he can pull off.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|Yes, needs to be  better copy read...errors!  Errors I catch in almost all books but they are few, this had a lot & was distracting.  This is not a book to read, a little childish & there are so many more books on the market.  Read something else.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great sequel to the first. I was hesitant to start given the ending to the first book however this was equally well written and it kept me engaged the entire way. Off to the third book.
0446530573|5.0|If you are a Sopranos fan and like to cook then you will love this magnificent book. A must have.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|This guide is a quick read and informative about using, setting up and the specs of the Raspberry Pi.  Thanks!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|They finally made diner dash deluxe for kindle fire now my sister will not be asking to play on my laptop P.S. FINALLY!!!!! THANK YOU!!! So much
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Broadchurch is a very  enjoyable &#34;who done it&#34; that keeps you guessing right to the conclusion.  Everyone is a possible suspect, and has their secrets.  But unlike the dark (literally and figuratively) series, The Killing, this series keeps you guessing, but is fast paced enough to hold your attention.  The only annoyance I found was with the actor, David Tennant's dialect.  I just found it hard to understand what he was saying sometimes.  But overall the cast, production values, and story line held my attention- so much so that when I had to leave the country for three weeks, I came home and rented the episodes that I had missed from Amazon
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this mah-jong.  where is my last order Hidden Objects Halloween?  OK please answer my message or I will cancel
B004PVKFR8|5.0|great album. I bought the album for the song 'Sail' but was greatly pleased by the entire album. Showstrings and Knights of Shame are great tunes!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game but I want to restart it and play it more.  the game stopped on me it won't let me play it again
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I never expected to read the book so quickly. I couldn't put it down. How could a movie do this justice?
B0086449YA|5.0|This album I'm glad has come to us here in the USA as it is a new classic..Reminicent of Eric Clapton with Knopfler's iconic sound feel and soul
0525425578|5.0|another great book great story line and a good plot just another outstanding book by my favorite author Theodore did another outstanding job
B000FBJG04|5.0|Watch the HBO series/movie, \\"Band of Brothers\\" and you will see the story of this book. It is an<br />incredible story that once read, you will pick up time and time again. If only we heard that men of this quality, character, nerve, and guts served together as one today, our world would be a better place. No matter the challenges that met them, these young men conducted themselves as any of us would want our  children to do in any situation they face in this life.
B004UXY5D6|5.0|Listened to this on the way to work this morning.  Can't wait to see them live on Saturday in Fort Worth at Ranch Bash.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Easy reading. Plot was a bit unbelievable. Excellent character description. Excellent descriptions of setting lIke a recruitment brochure but in a good way.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One word best describes Dr Sleep - Spellbinding<br />Stephen King, brings the reader back to the Overlook and shows us what has become of the little boy with shinning. Thank you Mr King
B0091REZMW|2.0|You keep having to repeat rooms to pick up new items. Stupid. I understand why it was free now. I am glad I didn't have to pay for it.
1469000431|5.0|Never too late to learn but I sure wish I'd learnt this a long time ago. This turns normal response upside down and says THAT'S normal, am already getting results with surprisingly less stress and effort!
B00CATSONE|1.0|I love science history and enjoy reading about Nikola Tesla so I downloaded this book expecting an entertaining evening at home. It's pointless to give a full review of the book since I didn't finish it - where to even start about how terrible the writing and organisation was? I won't start - just don't download it.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|ok 5 stars because ive. played on the iphone its awesome but why wont it download it says I need space no I don't on the iphone it only had 137 Mb and I have way more than that of space left its a great game but I cant download it
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|This was a lot of fun to watch with our 6yr old daughter. Will do again soon.<br />The quality was good too.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This is a great game with characters from the show and other popular ponies.  Problem is many of that characters are pay to play for example Doctor Hooves almost impossible to get.
B008G8SFGO|1.0|Another album with no hits and no relevant songs. Without Ace Frehley, the only Spaceman, there are no Kiss !!!
B008Y7J91M|3.0|This was alright, but probably the least of its type. It did have a fairly good story line that took some twists and turns.
B008GOAFBQ|5.0|One of the Kiss best albums ever, in a new brand new edition, with a bonus Ace Frehley solo !!!
1416972250|5.0|This was a fun read and the book quality met my expectations. It was like new. I would recommend it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Although I enjoy science fiction a great deal, I didn't start reading this book expecting to find so much in common with the main character of the book. In a strange sense, Ender Wiggin becomes the epitome of the every man, relatable to a majority of those that read this series.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My daughter and I binge watched the first four seasons on Amazon.  Season 5 is in progress but we will wait for it to come to prime members to watch.  We couldn't stand waiting a full week between episodes!
B00A2H9OZS|2.0|I saw this a the theater the other night and to be completely honest I really didn't like it.  It is the same story as the first movie, pitch black.  Same story, different planet and monsters.<br />I recommend to rent, not buy this movie.<br />I am a Riddick fan.  But this movie just doesn't do it for me.
B00ELCZSS2|4.0|I'm not in love with every track, but those that I do like, I love. Totally worth buying. Beautiful voice and innovative production qualities.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is a pretty fun game, and unless you want to play for hours at a time, it is not necessary to spend money.  It has been a little challenging to figure out all the different aspects of play as it seems you are pretty much expected to figure it out as you go.  BUT hey folks... it's FREE!
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Lorde has great vocals and hooks complete with interesting lyrics and a fresh sound. Not every song on this album is terrific, but there are some definite highs.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game.  It gives you a good map of where to search,a quest tab, and it is easy to use.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am obsessed with this book. At first i didnt think i could get into it, but when i did i couldnt stop reading it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I know everyone loves this app because its minions who doesn't like minions there cute and funny also sometimes weird lol plz just get the app it will do you good actually great
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I chose this book because I really enjoy Bill Bryson's books and we're planning a trip to Australia.  But more than fun, I've also found it to be really informative -- about Australian culture, geography, people, places, history...  I hadn't imagined it would help decide where to go or what to do, but it has given me lots of ideas.  I highly recommend this very readable book!
B009GXHOW4|5.0|This app is definitely what it says it is. I was afraid that it would be a scam, but it isn't. You can even copy worlds now because of the edit folder option. You can look at all the other cool blocks that are coded but bot in game yet, like spiderwebs, slimeballs, Inc sacs, chainmail armor, clocks, compasses, and WAY MORE... and it is all free.
B003ELMR9E|4.0|This is a great movie. Great acting by Robin Williams and Al Pacino. I will watch it again and again.
0345803485|3.0|I found the book to be a slow and methodic read where unwarranted. It tends to drags on. Personally knew someone somewhat like Grey whose name was also similar which is what kept me interested in finding out more about Grey and seeing how and how long his &#34;lover&#34; stayed in the relationship.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|I think this CD is greatness. I have listened to it twice. I love it more each time. Great CD.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Not my favorite King novel, but not my least favorite either.  It was a good story.  Tense and mysterious, but nowhere near as thrilling or terrifying as its predecessor, THE SHINING.  Still a worthwhile read.
B001NFNFF8|4.0|I am a huge James Lee Burke fan. Tommy Lee Jones is the best choice for this character. Love it.
B004QKNXIQ|2.0|Lots of words to keep Amazon happy. The bottom line is that it's completely inappropriate for children under 10. Disney has really slipped over the past several decades.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|This entire dystopian series was a refreshing change from the recent glut of zombie apocalypse novels.  In MaddAddam, Atwood brings more depth to the characters introduced in prior novels and brings the series to a satisfying close.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Well written, good characters, reasonably good dialogue, plot a little bit slow so far.  But I'm only half way through.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Can't wait for the next season to come out.  Love the characters. Always an interesting story.  Keeps my attention. My favorite show!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoy this series. The era is interesting,  the styles are dramatic, and the scenary is beautiful. Dramatic and mature.
B006T3RM08|5.0|Great value for the price.  Would recommend to buy from this seller.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|It makes you think and is a great time waster although not as difficult to master as some of the other games.  I like that you are able to match more than three at a time though and there is more than one objective to playing as well.
0439023513|5.0|Great book. I am still listening to this book on my mp3 player. I can not wait till I get to the end to see what happens
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Purchased this microphone and amazon replaced the unit once previously and it still doesn't work with my iPad. I I'll be returning it.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|It kept you continually on the edge of your seat. It is full of action and I enjoyed it very very much.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Love it!  Very entertaining, but becomes challenging as well.  Funny as well.  Only issue is that on the original Kindle Fire, having occasional issues with it force closing.  Seems to happen when you repeat the level multiple times. Still recommend the game though.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|This was very entertaining and I would recommend it to anyone. It was very heartwarming and I would consider it for all ages.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book was recommended to me along with the comment if I liked Gone Girl I would like this.  I thought The Husband's Secret a good read but not great.  I would recommend it.  I felt the beginning was very slow and the dialogue weak, butit seemed to pick up about 30% through the book.  The ending was excellent.  It was a shame the rest of the book wasn't of the same quality as the ending.  In all, if you wish to read a book that easy reading...go for it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I like the mystery games putting clues together and love the little puzzles nice brain teasers searching for items real challenges your mind being on a time limit just don't like having to wait on energy to build up to play fix it and I'll give you five stars
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|We are big fans of Nicholas Cage.  The movie was really cute.  A little slow at the beginning, but overall, I really liked this movie.  Great message for kids.
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|This movie was  like watching paint dry on a cool day. Couldn't get through it. It was not clear to me the whole entire movie was going to be acted in Shakespeare.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It's a great game to take up time and if I run out of things I wait for it and work for more. I don't like that I can only add five people at a time and then wait to see if anyone adds me in return
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't stop watching!  Can't wait for Season 3!  Wish I worked at that law firm!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Finishes the story begun in The Girl Who Played with Fire and wraps up all of the story details pretty well.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Although, she is still one of my favorites, the Feels Like Home CD is nothing like her previous one. Actually, I like the last one better because it had a more southern rock sound. Her new CD is very country.....<br /><br />At first I did not like it much but it grows on you. I'm starting to like it now after listening to it many times.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Love the whole cast and even though I am still in love with David Tennant (Doctor #10), Matt Smith is doing a great job!
B009LDD5E0|5.0|It shipped very quickly, quicker then the estimated arrival date! I'm happy with it and the quality is very good I love this past season, one of my favorites, i think they redeemed themselves after this one. The story line is great, really good. AMAZING price for this dvd too!
B004JN1D2I|4.0|This series just sucks you in. Well written and addicting. The worst part about this series is waiting for the next book to come out.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|Didn't like this movie.  Call me crazy, but it was too difficult to follow.  I like to relax while watching a movie, not have to pound my brain, trying to figure out what the heck is going on.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I am struggling to finish the fifth book in the series and have decided it is no longer worth my time.  I don't understand the need for the continuous debasement of women throughout the entire series.  It gets tedious and gross.  It adds nothing to the novel's understanding.  You made your point about 3 novels ago - enough!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so aesome and I have Benn playing for 5 years and it is no the only thing about the game I love I love all the amazing costums and people ways
0783235380|5.0|This is a very funny DVD to watch with your family, You will laugh and cry but you will be happy you bought it
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Huge fan of the Harry Potter books and movies.<br /><br />The box set is great because it doesn't take up much space, but holds every single movie.<br /><br />The Blu Ray really makes the first few movies look much better (though you can really tell when something was animated).
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I love this game but on the air plane, WHERE DO YOU BLOW?!??!??!?!!!??!?!!?!??!?!? (they should make a kindle version for two reasons, the plane to be remove and to make it so it fits the screen
B000BHN7D4|5.0|Anastacia, Pieces of a Dream: Anthology is excellent, quite rare to have a whole CD without one dud track on it.
B00C061I1M|5.0|One day soon, main stream radio is going to get a hold of this album and it is going to explode.  The sound is unique, and her voice is awesome.  Adele has nothing on Valerie June.  It doesn't hurt that this girl is beautiful, and stays connected to her fans very well on social media.  You should definitely buy this album.
B00004YYDI|5.0|A truly great film,it has the lot in spades, great acting,action and story line. Every movie collection should have this in it.
B00005N6KG|3.0|i like to run on treadmills and sweat a lot so i can't wear headphones that aren't vaguely waterproof.<br /><br />i've been buying these for years and the price keeps going up.<br /><br />they are extremely undurable - one of the ears will quickly fail - but i'm not sure if there is a better option.<br /><br />i buy them in pairs so when one breaks (as it inevitably does after a few months) i can switch to the other before i have the chance to buy another pair.<br /><br />Is there a better option out there? if yes please let me know.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|It can be an exciting read if you overlook the improbabilities.  Sometimes the situations test your credibility.  Nonetheless it is enjoyable
B00A89ITZG|1.0|Poor quality minimal juice, very slow movement. Juice spills from main base when the engine rotates. But the device is easy to clean.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|My husband and I enjoyed this movie. The young boy character was rather irritating with his non-listening but the actor did a really nice job.  We recommend it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Reading this made me think of how I would react in that situation. It was a difficult read for me due to the many emotions the story takes you through as a reader. Very we'll written. I have recommended Room to all my friends.
B00ET9T2WK|3.0|Good funny characters. Enjoyable game. The one drawback is that the game will frequently hang (especially after a PvP battle) or just shut off. I would have ranked it higher if it was more stable.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I have always wanted to read this book. An amazing story.<br />Great for middle school age girls to identify with the simpler<br />Things in which to delight in.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Easy to play fun to play its like your in the woods hd is good  easy to start up<br /> Recommended to play if like to play hunting games
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not a lot I can say that hasn't been said.  This show is brilliant.  Even has my very picky husband hooked.  The acting is beyond brilliant.  The storyline, some might say soap opera like, engaging.  I've laughed a ton, cried some too and just love, love, love it.
B008MM9630|5.0|I can't understand where to get this magic box or other items for the jewel quests. But other than that, good game
B0055V6EZE|5.0|This cd is a gift to have b/c we feel in love with House and so feel in love with Hugh Laurie.  It's nice to see another gift this talented man has to offer.  I love to hear him sing and play the piano.  He's just wonderful.  His music is music to my ears!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|As always I'm not disappointed. The emotions,drama and love in the book have me floating around. Absolutely amazing, I am looking forward to the next book but hating the wait.
B003G4W49C|5.0|\\"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....,\\" I was an avid science fiction reader.  A 30-year Army career followed by 13 years as a high school history teacher put a hiatus on such reading pleasure.  While teaching Military History, my students would often do book reports on \\"Ender's Game,\\" and their reports piqued my interest in reading the book.  When I learned that a film by the same name was soon to be released, I decided it was time to read the book.  I am glad that I did.  As a combat veteran (Vietnam), I appreciated the scenarios and leadership challenges that Orson Card presented.  I especially loved the quote, \\"Any decent person who knows what warfare is can never go into battle with a whole heart.\\"<br />Readers of all ages and genre will enjoy \\"Ender's Game.\\"
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This is a well acted and directed film, that didn't get the best of reviews when it hit the movie theaters. That said, it is a hypnotic ride, of intrigue, suspense and betrayal, set in the all too real world of corporate espionage and deceit. It is not easy to meld the current narrative with flashbacks, but this film does a commendable job with a complex story that not only takes twists in the story, but also emotional twists as well. We feel the anguish of the main character as well as his despiration while he digs relentlessly for the truth. A thriller, with a more European quality of cliffhanging, than the typical explosiveness of American mainstream films. Here the explosions are internalised, and felt when the heart is crushed.
B002T3A4KW|3.0|This is not a great story, but has lots of Julia Roberts' megawatt smile.  I have liked Hugh Grant in many movies and he did not have much of a part in Notting HIll but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple hours.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Love match three games.<br />Can't wait to see what comes out next.<br />Great fun game to pass the time. Keep up the good work.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This was one of the early Maxwell and King novels by Baldacci.  I have generally enjoyed reading his various series and am waiting for the next in this series to be realeased.
020530902X|5.0|Wonderful book for everyone who speak English. Beautiful language, a lot of humor and common sense. We presented this book to all our friends.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I wish both Stargate: SG-1 and Stargate: Atlantis were still on the air. Both shows were unique. The writers made an effort to make a great connected story off all the episodes.
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|PATIENCE!  PATIENCE!  PATIENCE!  Take a little to get used to, but in the end it worked.  Make sure you have plenty of bottles to test with - I broke about four before i got the hang of it. PATIENCE!<br /><br />Remove the label first to get a clean surface.  There are several ways to remove the cuts: Hot water & ice water.  Candle & ice. DO search on YouTube to find one.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for & more! Love the ability to mix up the 'noise'. Can't believe it was free on my kindle!
B004KBSQOW|5.0|The shipping was delayed a day and I wasn't able to give the CD as a gift for a birthday present. IZ's music is so relaxing to listen to.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I watched a lot of movies TV shows but this is something else, Its an awesome movie like never before!
B0071R43MG|4.0|I love listening to Satriani, G3 series has the best sound mix. Everything about this dvd is fantastic but was let down that there wasn't more included. Nothing to do with the dvd but seems as if Joe surrounds himself with lesser musicians.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are great.  There are a lot of fun tasks to keep you entertained.  And its a well made game all around
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Certainly 'food for thought'!  I admire Dr. Alexander, would like the opportunity to meet him, he has an inner sanctity about him and I very much enjoyed reading his book. It has made me think a lot about the after life and given me comfort in doing so.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|LOVE IT!!!!!! I'm a pro at this game and I never get tired of it. It's great if you like temple run. Trust me! Get it, and you won't regret it. Peace out...
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app Is so fun. I play it with my brother all the time. It's creative and adventurous I love it you should get this app.
B00E9P959E|5.0|I am very glad to hear this new remixed of this album, the sound is more clear and the songs looks like anew song. You can hear with clarity the guitars, bass, voices.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Amazingly witty and fun. Frequently find myself laughing out loud.  Tackles some great legal issues despite making them such that they fit into a 40 minute narrative.  They also get the closest to any show of what a lawyer's firm experience is. This show has given me a great many de ja vu moments with respect to my own career as an attorney.  The quality of the acting is also beyond reproach.
B003ZYJS42|5.0|It´s a good surprise discover a good hard rock played in this years, with a mixture of blues and funk. Magnificent sound, the guitars of Bonammassa are amazing and the voice of Glenn is perfect after all this years.
B00B671W6W|5.0|I love every song they covered on this little gem. Their rendition of AC/DC's TNT is out of this world!! I love the Doors cover too. Totally new direction with that. I appreciate there originality.  The cover art was a nice bonus.
B003TWKVYQ|4.0|Great album, with the power of thrash metal, good sound, in vinyl is a magnificent experience. I recommend this album if you want to know a excellent heavy metal band
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. Does it again! Perfect actor to play Tony Stark. My favorite one so far!  Looking forward to next Avengers movie!
B00DYCFKSI|3.0|Well, I expected many more from this album, to listen the influence from Mike Mangini, but I was a little disappointed, because the sound of the drum, an all the album, sounds like and album from new wave from the 80's
0446585025|5.0|This book is Ellen.  I am not a big reader, nor do I think that books can be &#34;funny&#34;.  Well, this book proved me wrong in both areas.  This book makes you think you are watching her show...she still rambles, changes topics in the middle of sentences, all while giving you an easy read that makes you laugh out loud.  It's a simple read too, no overthinking or analying..perfect for a way to relax from the work day!
0307341577|5.0|I loved this book. It was twisty and turny and shocking. 2 thumbs up! I would recommend ithis book to my friends.
B000HL2J0G|2.0|Interesting piece of history.  Maybe this is how it was once done but a little too much like things I have seen before.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Having read everything Malcolm Gladwell has written, I would classify this book as a decent read.  It won't blow your socks off....but it's worth reading, especially if you're a Gladwell fan.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Awsome can watch it over and over again and never get tired of it. would recommend to anyone anytime. excellent.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Liked the development of characters from the previous series.  Interesting balance of political and domestic lives, sometimes a little unbelievable but overall very entertaining.
B006BQNJR8|3.0|Not as good as the original but a decent prequal.<br /><br />I would not bet my fri or sat on the movie
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding series.  I can't wait for season 4 to get started.  I was enthralled with the story as it continued from seasons 1 & 2.  A lot of twists and turns really keep you wanting more.
B008JFUN6E|5.0|This movie is terrific.  About people helping people.  About sacrifice.  About sharing the wealth.  Great messages with tons of action.  Terrific acting (Matt Damon, what more needs to be said).  Very political, very, very relevant to today's political and economic landscape.  Cannot praise this movie enough.
0439023521|5.0|Amazingly thought out. How she puts the life in these three books are amazing!! Recomend these books for young adults and adults above 13.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app its so fun the graphics are so good.and espically on the kindle fire its a great sequel to temple run
1439163154|4.0|I like the concept of it and would definitely recommend it to a friend. Honestly I still havnt finished reading it yet but so far so good.
B00AOCLWF6|1.0|Show is extremely low quality. B rate. If you love all sci fi then this show is for you. Did they use a pc with windows 95? 16bit graphics on the aliens. Lost is better and the script writers were on something that had a roller coaster effect. What happened to legit scifi? World ends. Humans almost extint. But wouldnt you be hell bent on destroying everything? Not running like a scared cat?
B00CH87HF4|5.0|DH4 Or Dungeon Hunter 4 is better than DH3, according to the game,&quot;Like when I play its hard for me to fight on Dh3 while its easier for me on this. DH4 has more features than DH3 (Obviously)  Sorry for those who like DH3 Better than DH4, but this is simplely just my opinion.
B004OZOTSQ|1.0|Kindle fire has become a disable tool for me I am using Apple I pad  and samsung tablet  for my daily use
B004D7GU3M|4.0|one of the album art prints was sencored, and there were no extra track. But I am happy with the LP overall
0451419243|5.0|Loved as much as the first and do not want to wait until September 2014 for the third!!!  Will read the first 2 again
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Longer than other Jane Eyre renditions, so covers story in more depth.  I have liked more than one rendition but this one probably ranks the highest in most respects, but one with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds excellent too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great plot twists throughout the family and between the upstairs downstairs. Sometimes you wonder who was clinging to the past more, the head of the house or the family.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love the game, have it on my computer, tablet and phone.  Can have fun anywhere I am.  Would highly recommend.
B006MPKE9O|3.0|It is a nicely written book, but not quite my style of story, I decided to ditch it half way.  I can always come back to it if I feel that on reading any other comments, I was too quick to leave it.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Like to play when I need to relax and the scenes make me recall fun times in my own life. Good for a wide range of ages to enjoy.
B0071MDA2U|4.0|Totally love this series! I was really surprised and delighted by how fast paced this book is. So much action and tension, I could never put it down. Many long sleepless nights. I especially love the questions this book makes you think about. Only gave it a 4 star rating because of a glitch in this digital edition. It only occurred in the first few pages and then didn't happen again. It skipped the third page at first and when I tried to go back it still wouldn't display it, so I closed the book and then it was fine.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am simply in love with Gideon and Eva. I can't get enough of the story. I hope the next book comes out soon. I have read this series 3 times already and still I want more..I do hope they make a movie series out of this...
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|lend my old one to my daughter (big mistake) she lost it.  so I order 2 more not I don't have to worry about her losing it
B002N44XSG|4.0|I enjoyed reading it. I love all of Rick Giordano books . I am waiting for The House of Hades.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I like this type of entertainment and this is good, kind of along the lines of &#34;SLIDERS&#34;.  Too bad it's no longer in production.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Hands down one of my all time favorite reads. Patti is a consummate wordsmith and her prose impeccable. I love that NYC was a primary character and is key to the theme of the book. She captures the rawness of the era. Her personal accounts about Robert M. are heartbreakingly tender. I loved every single page of this book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love having this at home on my computer so I can keep in touch with my family and friends, but it was even better to be able to download it on my new smartphone so I can keep in touch while away from home.
B001TH16DI|5.0|These are the classics, great quality. Thanks!!<br />Don't know why I waited so long to get them.<br />No collection is complete without them.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Ok I love myself a good scare, I gravitate towards psychological thrillers not the gory slasher crapfest genre. Parts o  this new book by America's scaremaster Mr. King really disturbed me and I even had one hell of a nightmare.  What a scary story needs, this book has including the redemption that makes it all ok in the end. It's a little reminiscent of \\"Firestarter\\" but deeper in depth. I wouldn't  recommend this  novel for tweens and young teenagers due to some violent content.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool exceeded my expectations, which were already high. I have recommended it to others and will continue to at every opportunity.
B004GIZTNA|5.0|My Grandaughter is a wedding planner and it fits her to a T.<br />Comedy is more fun to watch than serious or tragic stories.
B00FEN000S|5.0|It's a fun &#34;smash 'em up&#34; movie.  If you enjoy the old monster movies then you'll probably enjoy Pacific Rim
B001F12J0C|5.0|All three are great movies - of course! - and fun to have at home  These are classics in the genre.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|I watched about 15 minutes of this and shut it off. The Stallone version was way better, and it was just ok.
B008Y212PI|4.0|its a fun game. It does get a bit difficult at the last set because you have to guess a bit. It could use bigger maps though, most puzzles are too easy on the largest size.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|You have to see it. An incredible history that remind us we must follow our dreams and work hard only for the joy of do what we love to do, the money its an extra reward for the effort
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|If you are a fan of point and click and hidden objects... this is the game for you. Original story, great graphics and hours of playtime. I played on the easiest setting this time...but I'll be playing again while waiting for another great G5 game. Hey G5... I'm waiting impatiently with my Kindle Fire and credit card in my hot little hands....
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love it. My kids can play it with out much help.<br />We like that you don't have to play it every day to get daily bonus.
B00BT70IWS|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann's selection of Verdi's arias are mostly exiting, and his dark timbre is beautiful - especially the two from 'Othello'.<br />But the package of Sony's design looks pretentious and crude.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game but it needs more stuff like monster in creative<br />And villagers way more people would play it<br />This is awesome good buy
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|nice product, well priced, nice to have option to charge multiple platform devices. i would recommend it to a friend
B00CH26TL8|5.0|This is a fun game and I like that it's connected to my Facebook. I do wish King games would hurry up and make their other games compatible with the Kindle Fire HD too, like candy crush!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found the author's way of taking such separate stories and winding them together intriguing.  The stories  were well written and held the reader's attention, while avoiding the temptation to be melodramatic.  As the individual stories progress, the characters from the other tales weave into the tale bringing it all together.  Very enjoyable.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It's a great game that's very addicting and easy to pick up for five minutes or an hour and playing as the zombies adds a decent twist.
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|i was fooled in believing the 3rd installment would be as good as the first an second ones, but i was really wrong.  i only watched the movie all the way through, because i had rented it.  the plot sucked, and the whole movie reeked!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Good special effects. Good acting. Decent story line. The actors that play Spock, Kirk, and Bones seem to have captured some of the mannerisms of the original Players, which adds to the believability of the Characters. I watched it more than once, which I do not do with many movies.
1449410243|5.0|This is a really cute book and a quick read. It would make a great coffee table book or gift for a cat lover. It's easy to pick-up and flip through. You'll laugh at each chapter. The illustrations are great and it's pretty funny. Very relevant to how cat's actually act.
B00884GR0W|5.0|My son loves this gamr he can be so creative some times and this game allows him to do that without destroying the house or yard lol ty
B000PXUA5W|5.0|Very cute, very adjustable.  My 6 year old loves this watch and frequently changes the color configuration.  Easily adjustable for size.
1400052181|4.0|It was good. Helped me a lot with class. And it's interesting to read. I like it a lot. Thanks
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I dislike this because  it's hard to read to small to read im only nine years old  I hate it it is  hard to read
B003B02PF4|2.0|after the first chapter chapter,  a significant part of the remaining book could have been cut without  without damaging the story.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|If you like murder mysteries with a twist, this is your movie.  Original concept and great special effects will keep you entertained.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Loved the  character development. Makes the reader wonder about the role of fan fiction and it's writers in the realm of literature and authors. Explores family relationships, loyalty and trust. The writing  style makes it hard to put down.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was most interesting trying to follow and  figure out this  ingima.It was very suspenseful and entertaining. If you enjoy games this one is fun.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Enjoyed the story very much. The development of parallel stories was excellent.  I did feel like someone had ripped out the last chapter though. It built to a climax that wasn't there.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Best show ever! Its a little violent but otherwise its a great show! Now I want to see all of the seasons.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|It follows all the Zombie rules.  You know they are attracted by loud noises can only kill them by destroying their brains and if they bit you, like vampires you're a member of the club.  All in all it's a good film faced paced and some jump out of your seat moments.
B0058SNKM4|5.0|Loved my crocs...they fit great and are so comfortable...love the style too...goes with anything...got to get more...crocs are awesome...helps with heal spurs too
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|Showing his age just a little, RDJ is no worse for wear in Iron Man 3.  Unlike Spider Man I don't think anyone else could play the part.The 3d is acceptable.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It´s my first time reading this author and I enjoyed myself so much, I already bought another book by Liane. The stories are well written and you can't stop reading till the end
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was very well written and I really enjoyed reading it.  I know someone who became a foster child during the 1930s and it was quite a tramatizing experience for her.  Our children are precious and need to be treated well so that they can grow up to be mentally healthy citizens in our country.
B000FC1K66|3.0|This is an interesting novel, that explores the collective shame and guilt of second generation adult children, living amongst those (Their parents's generation) who either directly or indirectly participated in the Nazification of Germany and the crimes committed under that regime.  Told initially through the eyes of a 15 year old boy, who goes on to study law at University, but is forced to confront his feelings about a love affair he had with an older woman, who happened to also be a former guard in a concentration camp.<br /><br />I rarely read a book after seeing the movie, but decided to give this one a go-- believing that perhaps it would delve deeper into emotions that the movie didn't.  Actually the movie was better.  This book is told first person, but as a recounting or \\"after the fact\\" retelling of a story.  That style in my opinion was a mistake.  It is kind of like having someone tell you about a dream they had, you are not pulled into the story in a satisfying way.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|A lot of people (including me) seemed to think that this movie would be terrible. The thing is, after actually watching it, I think it was great! Sure it's kind of sill, sure it's cliche, but non of that is inherently bad. Silliness is inherent in the idea behind the movie, yes building giant robots to fight giant monsters is pretty ridiculous, but the movie itself wasn't silly as long as you can just accept the premise for what it is. Likewise, the cliches were well executed. Things were predictable, but they were predictably good and enjoyable. My advice is to just check your brain at the door and enjoy this movie. If you go in expecting a fun action movie with cool looking giant robots and awesome fight scenes, that's what you'll get and you'll be happy.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This thing sucks man, don't waste your money. Maybe I have a faulty model or something but it just doesn't work right. 9 times out of 10 when I try and cast the video to the Chromecast it will pop up on the TV for a second and reset itself. It's extremely frustrating. I did a factory reset on the unit a few times but it still acts up. They need to fix some bugs with this thing big time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's one of those things where I can't wait to watch the next episode and yet I don't want it to end !  Such a lovely series!
B005PK1G76|4.0|We bought 2 of these, one for each side of our city mini double stroller. They fit well in the allotted space and provide some much needed organization.  You can fit a water bottle in each of the designated spot, perhaps a can of soda, but not a much bigger drink.  There isn't a ton of room but I am pleased with the purchase as a place to stick my keys, cell phone.  I would suggest this product to a friend.
B00C5R8364|2.0|Not his best.  Rather boring.. Couldn't wait to finish it and get to the obvious conclusion. Disappointing effort by one of the best of our time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is incredible but I don't no how to blow up the tnt<br />But another then that the game is a some<br />Who ever dos not have it beg your momy.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|I have been a fan of author Christoph Fischer since \\"Sebastian\\" [[ASIN:B00CLL1UY6 Sebastian (The Three Nations Trilogy)]] his first volume in The Three Nations Trilogy. After that came the powerful \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\" [[ASIN:B00AFQC4QC The Luck of the Weissensteiners (The Three Nations Trilogy)]], one of my favorite books of this year. In this third installment of the saga, we take a look at a rural Bavarian family coping with the vicissitudes of life in postwar Germany. The larger political and economic upheaval in the nation is telescoped down to the conflicts within this one sprawling, colorful family. This multi-generational tale is a brilliantly authentic period narrative while also being a juicy melodrama complete with family secrets and sibling rivalry. This is first-class historical fiction. As someone who dabbles in writing books in this genre I was blown away by the detailed recreation of time and place. At the same time, I found myself lost in the emotional life of Anna Stockmann and her compelling journey of self discovery. This book is recommended for history buffs but also for anyone who loves a good family drama - which should be pretty much everyone.
B008Q0AJA2|1.0|stupid boring,he tinks he is funny, a waste of time.glad he likes his funny lines cause i sure thought they were dumb.
B008XG1X18|3.0|It's nice to have one place to collect all my &quot;likes&quot;.  I've just recently joined and am still exploring all of the things that people are sharing.
B00DK9FNLY|5.0|I enjoyed the game.<br /><br />Even though I can beat all the time, it is still very fun to play once in a while to kill time.<br /><br />It's not an addicting game, but it is good to have to play once in a while.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is awesome!  Quick and very easy to use, it comes up on a regular scedule to keep my Kindle in great working order.  It makes removing unused apps so easy, cleans up all those stray files you'd never find on your own and monitors your SD card, too!
B00005N6KG|5.0|BUT HOW DID THE PRICE ESCALATE 4 TIMES??? OMG!  Did they add an extra piece of gold in these? I would purchase them at the old price again, but over $40 is insane
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Well researched and well written, the author works on what can be known about the &#34;historical&#34; Jesus.  Particularly enjoyed the notes in which the author reviews contemporary literature in the field.  Scholarly and yet suitable for a popular read.  I enjoyed the book.
B000FL7CAK|4.0|Its a great season and it just makes me wish there were more seasons to watch oh well I'll have to just wait for the movie!
B000002LAC|3.0|I purchased the original over a decade ago. Wore it out!  This new purchase was a replacement for the original.
020530902X|4.0|this book was required reading by high school teacher. we have not begun reading it yet, but the price and the shipping was great
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like this game.  Only able to go to level 10.  Waiting for more levels.  Not sure if that is because i got it for the app of the day or not.  Playing on transformer prime no problems
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Great acting.  Great storytelling.  Not for the faint of heart or those easily offended.  The third season just started and it looks like it will be another creepy, can't wait until next episode season.  I watched the first season in 2 days because it was so intriguing.  There is definitely no other shows on tv like American Horror Story.
B00FPH51LQ|1.0|Dumbed-down rip off of Men In Black and Ghostbusters (obviously written by three hacks at lunch). The acting is mindbogglingly over-the-top from Bridge and (as per usual) non-existent from Reynolds. It was dull, it was without laughs, and it didn't even look good. So sad -- I really wanted to like this film.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Wouldn't miss it. We always Tivo it so we are sure not to miss an episode. Sophisticated and enjoyable TV.
0440246318|5.0|Another  great Jack Reacher story from Lee Child.  I read all of his novels and truly enjoy these.  I hope he continues to write more of the Jack Reacher Series.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Before the 2009 Remasters became available, this curious little oddity came along.<br /><br />If The Beatles had originally released their recorded material today, it's hard to say whether or not it would have sounded this way.  This release makes obvious use of the typical overly loud, overly bright and overly compressed mastering techniques necessary in making all recordings sound modern to compete in today's marketplace.  The so-called 'Loudness Wars' have pressed upon Mastering Engineers to make records as loud as possible and everything else gets laid to waste.  Natural dynamics have been squashed out so all the loud and soft passages are now one lifeless uniform level.<br /><br />The sonic result is heavy-handed and often brittle at times.  Vocals can sound harsh and unpleasant.  This disc is stark and revealing of mistakes, flaws and edits.  Extreme limiting exhibits side effects such as heavy &#34;breathing&#34; or &#34;pumping&#34;, particularly of bass frequencies.  This is most noticeable on We Can Work It Out.  The audible artifacts of this extreme treatment have marred an otherwise beautiful recording.  On Hey Jude the vocal consonants make it appear that equipment seems in misalignment.  In She Loves You there is an obvious tape edit that is all too jarring right at beat four of the measure before the phrase &#34;Pride can hurt you too&#34; and then again at the pick-up notes &#34;Because she..&#34;<br /><br />On the other hand minute details are revealed in full.  This can be a plus for the curious listener determined to get every nuance brought to the fore.<br /><br /> I have reservations about his disc.  It's true that you're hearing things you've never heard before but some of these things you don't want to hear.  I understand a 2009 Remastered version of this collection has now been released making this one obsolete.  The over-the-top delivery of these songs here make this particular disc a unique collector's item.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought 2 already and plan to buy a few more. Netflix,Hulu, and youtube! I bet many more services will come soon. Great investment in my opionon.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Who doesnt love The Avengers? And all the awesome and attractive actors?! Plus there is as much humor as there is action!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This was working fine until this last update.  I cannot use it because it requires the update which installs to a 'parse error'  repeatedly. I am installing on a brand new android phone!  This is ridiculous!
0671722905|3.0|I purchased this book for an English assignment.  Used edition.  It was in good shape when I received, and was perfectly fine content-wise.  However, the book was so old that the binding gave out/pages eventually all fell out and the cover cracked and fell apart.  It is now cobbled together with clear packing tape.  The assignment is done, so now it is just a throwaway, instead of a keeper.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Can't remember the last time I read through the night.  Fabulous book.  Odd that in just a few chapters the story was told by characters other than the main narrator, but was only a minor distraction.
B00ELD3MUW|2.0|Does not do what I expected it to do with TV Flash videos.  Get much better service for the Amazon Beta Flash Player.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|Long and drawn out. Husband lost interest early on. I stuck it out but was disappointed. I expected better with these actors.
B00BMR4RIG|4.0|I enjoy this program and use it every day.  It keeps me posted on the current weather conditions and 5 day forecast.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game and with this system where only one cards turns over it give a greater chance to win, keeps my interest.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|Even though dialogue was minimum, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is beautiful and stunning, visually. The story is compelling and sweet.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I was already a fan of the TV show, but Johnson's writing beats the TV all hollow.  I don't recall when I last laughed out loud while reading a murder mystery--probably never.  The characters Johnson has created are fully fleshed, fascinating human beings.  I'm from Montana, so the taste of Wyoming he provides is an extra-tasty dish.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Great movie! Suspenseful and interesting!  Denzel Washington is such a great actor! I usually love all movies he plays in
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|Joss Whedon does it again! The cast does an amazing job, though Nathan Fillion steals the show. Best movie i've seen all year!
B00F35BV64|5.0|This is a must see movie.  All the action, drama, and sci Fi you can handle. The acting and writing were phenomenal.
B00E6Z0THE|4.0|Game is fun and entertaining with beautiful graphics. would buy again. Love the alice in wonderland theam on this game
B000W91RUG|5.0|All I have to say is everything is in good shape! The dvds are perfect and my family was able to enjoy it!
B00F88H5K2|5.0|I expected Matt Damon to be good...Michael Douglas surprised me!  His impression was right on, the acting seamless.  Watch a You Tube clip of Liberace and you'll see how accurate the depiction is!
B00BC5AWNM|1.0|This book is an indoctrination manual. Immorality abound and they are making kids read this crap in school.  What ever happened to the classics like Moby Dick, To kill a mockingbird.  The country is so backwards.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|What a find! I'd never heard of them before, but what a group, they really put everything into their songs. I do think the drummer is a little full of himself, but he is phenomenal.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|I am so buzzed on this movie because there are so many actors I just love.  Especially fantastic was Charlton Heston as the leader of the acting troop.  I also enjoyed the comedic actors playing the &#34;funny roles&#34; it helped me understand it better.  The sets were lush, emotions convincing, the costumes TO DIE FOR. Kenneth Branagh really did a spectacular job on this one.  The only setback was that I had to watch it in episodes. It is extremely long.  But worth it!
B000FBJAF0|4.0|Kind of tedious at the beginning...several story lines not well differentiated with dates or places...but I'm glad I stuck with it because it all comes together in the end.
B002APU580|5.0|I purchased this movie on disc, and apparently forgot. So I rented it here on Amazon and watched it TWICE during my rental period. Imagine how irked I was when I found it in my DVD Case Book. Then, I watched it again. This movie is the best &#34;watch it alone&#34; movie, EVER.  I just love everything about it.  The poised propriety, the ingenuity, the coldness of certain characters. The nuance, and the innuendo.  I don't always like modern movies but this one is so well done.  I never get tired of my Jane Austen!
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|I like that you can add other locations, not great but okay for sure, radar would be better if possible. Simplistic design works for my needs.
0061900656|5.0|This is a wonderful book for a child who will be adjusting to the arrival of a new sibling.  Easy to read and wonderful graphics.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|works good., however Hand and Foot does not work, so don't order Hand and Foot  That is all I have to say
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game. Play it all the time. Very easy to play though be prepared to lose track of time when playing.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My son is a huge lego and mine craft fan so when I found these I had to order!! He plays with it constantly!
B00F56AZK4|5.0|I enjoy the puzzles, and find it to be an excellent game. However, the only downside to this is that I wish they would give us a few more free puzzles to complete. This is the only issue I find with being &#34;free&#34;. But, overall, it is great if you enjoy completing puzzles.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|The movie was not downloading properly; slow motion video but audio was going on- that's why 3 stars. Thank you
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I had issues right from the start with the game freezing up. I d/l it onto my Kindle Fire and couldn't even play the game. Deleted this off real quick.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just challenging enough not to cause you to get frustrated and quit.  I look forward to more rooms being created.
0307730700|5.0|a must read for all who enjoy reading about our armed forces.  This man is from my home state and a true American Hero.  We need more like him and we as a nation owe all our armed forces a debt of gratitude
B004EWFUQY|4.0|The reason I gave this book a 4 star and not a 5 star rating is because I have only been on the diet for a few weeks.  It is working well so far but I would like to give it a little longer to rate it 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I found the second to almost be as good as the first.  The arena that they get thrown into was a bit minor in the story line as I wish more time was spent discussing the horrors.  Overall a nice lite read.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|So handy on my Kindle as I use Google many times a day.  Even when I'm not at my PC always have my Kindle on.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I loved the story and the characters and was eager to read this book daily! Highly recommended! You'll love it!
B00FPGSPQU|1.0|This was barely recognizable when to the first two movies. I enjoyed those...What waste of my money, oh, but I did get a clinic the many, varied, intelligent and appropriate ways to use the \\"F\\" word, most of which were forced and unnecessary.
0141345659|5.0|A heart-touching story of teens with a sense of humor, compassion and love. John Green is an excellent writer and storyteller and I recommend this book to young adults and older!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this movie but I did! Jamie Fox is great! I would highly recommend this movie.
B004LX0D36|5.0|It is better than the movie, so rich and full, but seeing the movie gives one a sense of character!  It is a timeless book, people still do same dumb things!
B008Y6S07M|5.0|Will smith was amazing, and this is a true story. Everyone loves a story that shows that persistence and hard work pays off.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining is my most favorite book of all time out of the thousands I  have read. This sequel is every bit as enjoyable and finely skin tingling!
B00AKKS278|5.0|I have not enjoyed a book more!  I am very excited to really start my Miracle Morning 30 Day Transformation with Mike.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I stay up till 4am reading this book because the truth is you can't read it all at once you have to put it down then pick back up I probably cried a hour straight get thinking about this and if it happened to me I would recommend this book highly and I am positive you will cry at some point if you have a heart :`(
B005PK553C|5.0|Loved it can't wait to get the other seasons. Wish they were free on prime. Definitely will recommend it. Great
B008RXYOKY|4.0|cheaper and better than any chinese cable. It needs extra power to work. Only worked on my Hard drive. but it doesn't work on peripherals with no DC power, like cameras.
0307010856|5.0|Bought 2, made one into a clock for my wife. It was her favorite book as a child. The second one will be reading to our baby.<br /><br />thanks
B00005Q66T|5.0|The recording of the songs featured on GHV2 (Greatest Hits, Volume 2) was quite the journey for Madonna. After 1992's Erotica was released, critics argued that her career was over. As brilliant as the album was (showcased here on \\"Erotica,\\" \\"Deeper and Deeper\\"), many stated she went too far with her sexual image. 1994's Bedtime Stories seemed to be the first attempt at damage control for the controversy, featuring more sexually subtle work. Bedtime Stories spawned 4 singles (all featured here). The singer's longest run atop the Billboard Charts \\"Take a Bow,\\" \\"Human Nature,\\" (edited for content on GHV2) underrated gem \\"Bedtime Story\\" and the stylish \\"Secret.\\" Her role as Eva Peron in 1997's Evita accompanied the release of hit \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina,\\" the epic ballad that served as sort of a middle ground between the more sexual and more spiritual Madonna. 1998's Ray of Light worked wonders for Madonna's career as it put her back on top. \\"Frozen\\" slyly kicked off the singles with its touches of synth, power drums, and its honest statement. Other singles from Ray of Light include the title-track, the gorgeous \\"Power of Goodbye\\" and spiritual \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love.\\" 1999's fantastic \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" off the Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me soundtrack was another soundtrack hit that worked as a middle ground between albums (and personas). It finely built a bridge between the sensual electronica of Ray of Light and the funky disco, country-rock fusion on 2000's Music. The superb Music spawned 3 singles; the glorified title-track, the country-pop \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and sensitive \\"What It Feels Like for a Girl.\\" Along with Erotica's singles, Music's singles seem to be the most edgy on this compilation.<br /><br />Every song on GHV2 is essential. It's a hits package for any Madonna fan, particularly those who appreciated her musical maturity and diversity from this time in her monumental career.
B000JMKNJ2|2.0|While the story was engaging, I was put off by the prolific swearing in this book.  I will not be reading the rest of the series.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like this game. I would recommend this game to anyone. Just wish I didn't run out of energy so fast. I think we should have unlimited. All the good stuff cost too much. But I still like it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm enjoying this series and looking forward to starting the last book in this series. I had a hard time putting the book down!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is wonderful! I love being able to carry and read my bible whenever and wherever I may be and have access on all my mobile devices.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I actually loved this book.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the ending was not as detailed as the rest of the book.  I found it interesting and emotional and fresh.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|i love this show could watch over and over again!!! And i plan on doing just that.!! love it love it!!
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Great, but haven't I played this game before?  The art music and game play is awesome.  Still somewhere around level 9 I had a huge feeling of deja vu.  If you can't get enough of games like candy crush then try this game.  I think you will like it.  However the lack of unique expierence led me to put it down and I haven't picked it up again.
B00873GRU4|5.0|I found this authors writing style amazing, even in slow parts of the story I just felt I should keep reading and I'm definitely not regretting I did. Loved the story and well that whole dark future scenario, and the way the author developed the characters, just plain out awesome, already read the second book, and can't wait for more.
B00CAYHVKQ|5.0|E Squared by Pam Grout<br /><br /> Let's face it.  Most of us want more out of life.  We want to look good and feel great.  Have an abundant life with a career that makes are heart sing while traveling and making a difference in the world.  Maybe you would like to attract a lover or new car.  We all have desires, and practice with different ways of manifesting these gifts.  For some, gifts of a home and friends come easy, while love and career can be more of a challenge.<br /><br /> In the book E squared by Pam Grout you are supported with 9 experiments where she takes you through easy exercises with fun stories and empowers you to jump right in and take control of your life!!!  You can have instant success and as well learn how to make long term plans.  What I love is this puts you in charge of your destiny as you learn how energy and consciousness work together.  You will be able notice what you have manifested already easily in your life and what needs more work.  But this work is fun!<br /><br /> As a school teacher of 12 years I feel that Pam delivers a very fun and easy to follow guidebook that comes to life.  If you have read The Secret or anything on the Law of Attraction, or even The power of Now, you will love this little treasure and helpful reminder.  Plus she has done a tremendous amount of research to support the concept that \\"our thoughts create our reality\\", and will make a believer out of any skeptic or first timer.  She delivers scientific knowledge easily and presents many cases of placebo effects that in return opens up your mind to the unmistaken truth that we can heal ourselves.  We are the creators of our lives!!!!<br /><br /> I am very thankful for Hay House books and their Book Nook Blogger Community, and Pam Grout for the opportunity to read and review this wonderful addition to our New Age of Spiritual Awakening and Self Realization of our own God Given Powers.  I was blessed with the opportunity to receive books for free for reading, evaluating and writing a review in return.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love this game but I was a little put out when I downloaded the game it worked for a while then I had to buy it in order to make it work better the free game would stop working but I really like it just wish I could figure out how to make it a little bigger on my kindle some of the games are very small it's hard to see them
1439152810|2.0|I felt the book's author was not of the caliber that I prefer to read.  It is more of a book for a teenager maybe?
B003INBNXO|5.0|I love it. WOW Ip Man can beat many men that I have seen. I wish I can see real person like him in real life. He was so strong and good man and sweet man. It will be nice to meet him
B0042816YK|1.0|Warning: Love movie but this is 2nd copy of Eat Pray Love that was faulty, although it was brand new.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|Simply great.  Full of energy and powered by dynamic characters every bit as good as the origional cast.  We are reallly lookinf forward to more stories.<br /><br />RSC
B008XBCJ34|2.0|I do love avatar film, however one of the disc's do not play, and can only play the 3D version disc, the other disc that plays the normal version doesn't work, so was disappointed
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|The description and cover don't do it justice. So many of these things are written by one of a few writers, and are so predictable they're just not much fun. We watched this with low expectations, and were very surprised at how entertaining it was.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It just was not that good...some OK action scenes...Brad Pitt tried to carry the film and his acting is good but the script is not that great. If you watch it for the action it is good but past that you will be disappointed
B009AMANH4|4.0|The movie was excellent, if not my preferred type of film.  It was a gift to a relative and very successful at that, which is of course the whole point of the purchase.
B00821OX98|5.0|I had never heard of this show before I saw it on Amazon Prime, but this is a good one.  Highly recommend!!!!!
B0000WN0ZK|2.0|Disappointing. Difficult to understand why it was regarded so favorably back in the 60's. Slow, seems to go nowhere, and the sex which apparently caused some alarm at the time was coy and I thought ridiculous.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This may be the best of the three Iron Man Films to date, and in this reviewer's opinion, certainly one of the most meaningful and entertaining theater releases of the 2013 summer season. Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark is back. However, gnawing at him are the post-traumatic effects of his exposure to the aliens and worm-hole stresses of his work with the Avengers in New York (as experienced in the earlier Marvel's The Avengers film of last year). The effects on his life range from an inability to sleep, to a constant tinkering with variations of his Iron Man robotic suits (reflecting a heightened focus on insulating his body) and an inadvertent distancing of himself from the woman he truly loves, Pepper Potts. And into this uncertain time in his life comes a new threat to world peace who will only identify himself as the mysterious \\"Mandarin\\" and who Tony learns uses ex-soldiers as unknowing human bombs to accomplish his agenda.  Worse yet, as Downey Jr./Stark narrates from the very film's outset, it's all the result of Stark's own past carelessness with others coming to bite him back in the present. Tony takes a pasting in his initial battles with the Mandarin before realizing the true influence behind the Mandarin's overt terrorist attacks. Along with Robert Downey Jr.'s and Gwyneth Paltrow's own strong acting and familiarity with their roles, the characters and film are abetted by the enjoyable involvement of a \\"wiser-than-his-years\\" fun ten-year old boy. Despite all his gusto, and all his wealth, Tony Stark has to dig deep within himself, to his own core innovativeness to rescue himself and his world and resolve the obscured complexities he's become enmeshed in - personal and collective. This film offers enthralling action in the tradition of the best of the Iron Man films, and it's also great storytelling with a very human and wonderful moral tale.  The films' resolution is visually and morally uplifting!  I highly recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i tryed to find something  elts and this is really good. i love it. i really really really do. i feel like  this helps alot in some situations. love it.  keep up the good work
B00F35BV64|1.0|If you like space battles, nifty new design concepts of ships and you felt that the  nearly fifteen minutes in Star Trek The Motion Picture still wasn't enough time to fully visually caress the exterior of the U.S.S. Enterprise, then  you'll love \\"Star Trek: Into The Darkness\\".  To Be fair, the actors give fantastic performances.  Chris Pine, as Kirk, Zachary Quinto as Spock, and the other actors who reprise their roles of the Enterprise crew have absolutely grown in their roles and as before are a joy to watch.  For viewers remotely familiar with Star Trek's television canon, there are deep mischaracterizations of the \\"villain\\" Khan.  These mischaracterizations are aside from altering his initial ethnicity (In the 1967 \\"Space Seed\\" Khan Noonian SIngh appears of Indian extraction - in the film, he is British}.  In the TV episode, the \\"Space Seed\\" script and Ricardo Montalban's performance crafted the 300 year old frozen superman as a suave, commanding, charismatic leader who was as much a ladie's man as he was a tactician and intellect.  In contrast, Orci and Kurtzman's script has dumbed down Khan to the level of a vindictive, reactive wounded wolf who leaps before he looks in attempting to manipulate Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise into serving his goals of rescuing his fellow frozen supermen. The film also does not pay full homage to Roddenberry's depiction of a 23rd century United Federation of Planets that is pushing out colonies into the far reaches of the galaxy.  The script isolates almost all of the terrorist and political damage on Earth.  The initial terrorist incursion is in a visually stylistic London, the Star Fleet council that is convened to consider the events is also on Earth and the threat from Khan seems primarily aimed at Earth. Other than the Klingons, we have little sense of the rest of  human colonization.  Those who may be aware of Abrams,Orci's and Kurtzman's preference for Star Wars will also note that as in, the earlier 2009 film thereis obvious Star Wars homage.  The situation is that the Enterprise crew needs a stealth way into a Klingon stronghold without identifying themselves as Federation - so Kirk orders that the ship from their recent \\"Mudd incident\\" be manned by Kirk, Spock and Uhura in an attempt to get past the Kiingon defences.  The shape of Mudd's freighter has an odd commonality with a miniature plain surface version of the Millenium Falcon. The bantering that goes on amid the characters, while different in content, is reminiscent of the camaraderie of Skywalker, Leia and Solo. The external shots of the ship's evasion of mountains and pursuing Klingon vessels involves side swipes that seem to pull directly from the cinematography of the Millennium Falcon in it's desperate efforts to escape the Empire's pursuit in Star Wars. For mindless action entertainment and adequate blue screen cinematography you can get away with spending a couple hours watching this film - but don't expect much of a take-away, other han a few smiles for enjoyable nostalgic character enactments by some truly gifted actors.
B005BZQVJ8|4.0|Another hit from the team who created \\"Shawn of the dead\\". Even thoug I am not a huge fan of Seth Rogan, ( I did like him in the Green Hornet), He is very funny here. Pegg and Frost are a very good modern day \\"Abbott and Costello\\". Good story and a lot of fun to watch.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|As always this is great music. Buy it, listen to it, watch the video. You're sure to enjoy it all !
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|I gotta say, you had to be high to go for this. The cast was great, the acting was good, the effects were good. The physics were just garbage...made it difficult to watch. I think \\"Yellow Submarine\\" had much better science and realism. In a 1 to 10 scenario I would say 3 maybe 3.5 but it was hard to keep watching because of the absurdity.
B000JIHP88|4.0|I was very happy with the quality of the product.  My son loved to fall a sleep to this mobile.

B008IBPMZG|5.0|Clean enough for my kids to watch.  Romantic and fun for me! I can hardly wait to watch the next episode!
B000002J09|5.0|I had the vinyl, had a cd that got lost, and purchased it again. Maybe not the all time favorite for Zep fans, but &#34;Going to California was worth the money

B000002O5L|3.0|Excellent disc. I have listened to it extensively already and plan to listen to it again and again. Everything U2 has produced and played is great.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love these games and I was wondering if there will be a 3rd one? I would love to help.
0061124958|5.0|In addition to his independent reading, we do nightly &#34;family reads&#34; of classics with our 6 year old.  Charlotte's Web, one of my childhood favorites, was a big hit!  My son couldn't wait to sit together and enjoy a couple of chapters each night.  Such a beautifully worded story, makes you truly love each and every character.

B009AY04A8|3.0|It was a great game easy and good for kids.needs to be harder but fun. My husband and I played together.my kids loved it. Reminds me of a treasure island game. To short .want to play more.
B00846REIS|5.0|Buy all titles or the set right from the start!! I couldn't put any of them down!!!! Loved the story line!!!
0340738448|5.0|Arrived very quickly and this script is so well written you won't even realised you are reading. Great pics all through too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Buy all titles or the set right from the start!! I couldn't put any of them down!!!! Loved the story line!!!
B000QE9ERK|5.0|Typical Johnny Depp, even before he rose to mega stardom...i am glad that the Czech capital Prague is mentioned in the movie.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Just keeps getting better !!!!! Buy all titles or the set right from the start!! I couldn't put any of them down!!!! Loved the story line!!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Seems like when you get stuck, that's it. Done. It was cool until I hit the dead end, alas. Hints would be nice, or even some more obvious choices. :)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I just couldn't get into it. Very hard to get it all together. Confusion at the beginning. Will try again.
B00F1RR3Y8|5.0|This is a really fun game.  It lets girls be girls to design nail art.  My daughter can't stop playing it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book got me interested at the beginning and I learned a lot about how the armed forces work and train.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|It was a nice book, with believable characters, that was easy to read, and with an ending that seemed fitting,
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Not a game changer (yet), but a great product.  Waiting for Google to roll out more Chromecastable apps, but still, kicking youtube to the TV is pretty slick.
B004IQ78HA|5.0|why the best movie of all time of course. in great quality and loaded without wait. i do encourage to watch loucaumed
B00EC7GRS6|5.0|After reading reviews I was skeptical, but I wanted to help my phone maintain a good seal on the USB port by not opening it all the time. Once I got the dock it was amazing! You just slid it back and forth and it will click in place perfectly every single time!!<br /><br />Anyone who owns the Xperia Z Ultra should own one!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It took me a little while to get to know the all the characters but once I did... this book was a page turner and I was more engrossed with each chapter. The ending was splendid! This would make an amazing movie.
1401907725|5.0|Wonderful cards! Easy to read and they are beautiful! I look forward to reading them every morning before a stressful work day!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wasnt sure I was going to like the show, but started watching it and got hooked.  I've really enjoyed watching the plot develop
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The writing. . .I never noticed the writing. I just felt what the people were feeling.<br /><br />The story had so many interesting twists.<br /><br />Can't get enough. . .so I'm on to Shift.
B00DW39B2K|1.0|Did these two just need a paycheck?<br /><br />Did they read the entire script prior to signing on?<br /><br />Potential that morphed into to absurdity and stupidity.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I'm not sure how this book has made it on the top charts for so many months on end, but it didn't hit home for me and left me hoping for more to no eval. I couldn't finish it and trust me when I say I don't do that often. I read 1 book a week or so just could finish it, sorry :(
B00821OX98|5.0|The best sci-fi story to ever hit TV! The characters are awesome, the story line is different form your usual aliens invade earth type of show. I can't wait to see season 4!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was touched when I was reading it at first. It was amazing to see how God changed a person by his mighty power and endless love. But the later part of the book became so complicated. Not that people couldn't understand it, but it lost the original flavor from the first half of the book. Didn't mention the Good News. Wouldn't recommend it to others.
B0017TFLBQ|5.0|Heroes III complete in a fairly functional official package. This is an excellent base program, as good as 3DO ever developed it. It makes a good base for using the various enhancements available.
B00003CXRM|5.0|this was a great gift for my mom, this is a very funny movie. it is now classic!!! this is worth the price!!!
B000JPRPAO|4.0|Suspenseful and action packed from start to end. reminded me of &#34;a Thief robs a thief&#34;<br />Thats a spanish movie that has a similiar plot
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A spectacularly engaging, tremendously well-written tale, centred around a &#34;well, the odds-makers were right, it really CAN happen&#34; scenario.  From the outset, the reader is captivated, engaged and invested (go on, I dare you NOT to be!) in the the very believable lead character as he faces an almost impossible challenge: survive alone, on Mars, without a support network.  The science is right (almost unscrupulously), the scenario plausible (if unlikely) and the ending never certain.  A VERY entertaining read.  I hope to read more from Mr. Weir!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love bingo and tjis is the best bingo game out there!!!!  I like playing people from everywhere.  Thrre are a few little things that could be slightly improved,  but I still log in every night to play!!
B00FPH6M82|3.0|I went into this movie wanting to punch myself for renting an M. Night Shamalan movie. I said to myself, &#34;The twist at the end better be me saying, &#34;Wow! That wasn't terrible!&#34;&#34; Well, wow! That wasn't terrible! It wasn't great. Maybe not even good, but it wasn't dreadful. A lot of the plot elements, in typical Shamalan fashion, made no sense whatsoever. Lazy story building, and such. But overall, I expected a turd, and at least it wasn't that.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Stargate is one of my favorite \\"sit back and enjoy it movies\\", much in the mold of many of the great space adventures, but with a fairly unique twist - it's origins are in ancient Egypt. It is well acted with James Spader, Vivica Linfors and a very young Kurt Russell all turning in fine performances. Elaborately produced, great costumes and a good script. Very enjoyable.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app allows me to do searches to complete the crossword and &#34;seven word&#34; puzzles on my kindle. No more running to the computer.  It is easy and quick to use.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would recommend this book to EVERYONE, even if you never lived with a dog. The insight Enzo has is something from which we could all benefit!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Excellent book for both military and non-military folks, helps you get a better sense of what our men and women are fighting in the pit, and more importantly, what they are fighting for.  The sacrifices these men and women make can never be repaid, but we can honor them by learning and sharing their stories, and serving those who served us so honorably.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The movie seems to be for teens or boys from the ages of eight and higher. Not a movie for adults as the content is shallow and the acting. The action in the movie is good, but does not jive with the faint storyline. Dwayne Johnson seems to be typecast for all of his movies he is almost the same character. he is like Disney movies where the character name and face change, but all else is the same.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Journey is a beautiful game , not for everyone though . If your into shooters and that is it than by all means stick to what you know . But if your willing to try something a new game experince than get Journey it will not disappoint its amazing and beautiful .<br /><br />Flower is very relaxing and the goal is touching , but the main draw for this bundle is defitnetly Journey . Flow is nice not much to say its like a mini game so its fun cute .<br /><br />Great art in a single bundle . This is why Games should not just be considered games but ART .
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I am obsessed with with show. I never have any complaints about an episode. I love the all! If you haven't watched this show I highly recommend it.
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|Finally a sailor moon figure we can all fall in love with and remember our first steps into anime loving fans . Sailor moon along with cardcaptors were my first anime loving steps . This figure is amazing and will not disappoint , only thing you will be annoyed with is yourself for not making up your mind in what pose to pose her in . She has so many poses and hands along with face plates that range in so many emotions like Serena herself . She also comes with Luna , its a super nice add on to have Luna although small in size still detailed and cute . Cant praise this figure enough and knowing it was made for the fans and made properly love it .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The story has so many twists and turns that you find yourself wondering what will happen next. My only criticism is the ending was very anticlimactic and I thought it could have been resolved in a better way.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show got addicted after two episodes. Wish season 3 was available with Prime this would help me catch up.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Amazing.. All i have to say.. Heart warming, inspirational and everything in between. Shows how tough seals are. It was just amazing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is one of the greatest Bond movies of all time! Even my wife loved it and she has refused to ever watch any 007 movies till now. It is definitely part of my movie collection.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Nice item , good quality, truly does the job at a great Price!, & waiting for new apps to come.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Bought this for my wife an I anniversary and we just laugh every time we watch it. This show is the best TV show out there, hands down.
B007PJLUG2|4.0|Very funny movie. I would watch it again when I need a laugh.  I would recommend this movie to family and friends.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I enjoy this game. The easy levels, 5 by 5, area good way to learn how to play.  The most difficult levels are challenging but not so hard I lose interest in the game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is great, I use it for the daily reading program.  Wish I could down load onto my kindle so I could read when not on WIFi.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There are times where you are sitting in your living room and a particular YouTube video, or website comes up.  You want to show it off, and everyone huddles around your phone to see.  Enter Chromecast.<br /><br />I'm using a 6 year old sony XBR (non-smart) tv with the chromecast.  Video signal is transmitted over an HDMI port, and the Chromecast is powered using the USB connection on the TV.  Setup is quick and painless  utilizing an app available for download online via browser for your computer, or in either respective store for iOS or Android.  Right now, you can &#34;cast&#34; any content from a browser window directly to your TV, in addition to specific support for Netflix and HULU (soon to come I believe).  I hear there is further development going on to implement more features (i.e. casting local filesystem content).<br /><br />If you don't have a smart TV, game console, or any other way to view streaming video content at your TV, this is an indispensable device.  Even if you do have those things, at $35 this is a nice toy to play with, providing a backup in case your other video streaming hardware options bite the dust (my XBOX 360 just died recently).  You can literally move a streaming video mid-view to your tv, and continue to control the playback via phone or tablet.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|I usually try to watch this one once a year, it's a really cute movie.  Love the actors and the music.
B0000A14WB|3.0|Pet sounds was revolutionary for the time.  The Music is still enjoyable to this day, and I'm a generation younger than most others that really appreciate it.<br /><br />The most interesting thing on this disc would be the outtakes.  I'm not a super audiophile, but I feel the mix on the main tracks is too rear heavy, even though the resolution is probably on par with the best.  if you don't care about outtakes I would spend my money on the mono or stereo mix instead.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I love knowing I have a flashlight at all times.  Very wonderful app. Helps me be safer with grandkids too.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is a great best-of &#34;collage&#34; type album.  The 5.1 is utilized very well, and the resolution is great.  If you are a Beatles fan, and you are the ONLY other person (besides me) trying to show off their DVD-A system this is a good choice.<br /><br />If you are a Beatles purist, you probably won't like this one, but you also would have rejected this album based strictly on the description alone.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Grandkids love it.  I have no idea since I have not tried to play it.  It isn't my kind of game.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This movie keeps you thinking and trying to figure out what is going to happen. The ending gave me two different looks into who was the Great Gatsby and why.
1616550414|5.0|If you are a Zelda fan, this is a no-brainer. A must-buy. This full-color tome contains the much-debated Zelda timeline (which even the creators have stated may not be 100% accurate), gorgeous artwork and encyclopedic information from nearly every Zelda game (although some get more representation than others), and concludes with an awesome manga taking place even before the &#34;first&#34; game in the timeline, Skyward Sword. The gold ink trimmed hard cover and print quality are top-notch.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|His music and voice, have such feeling, and watching him play live, is all the better! I first saw him on a PBS special and was blown away!! Stevie Ray Vaughn reincarnated, not to diminish Stevie's memory, at all, I know there is a difference, but still Joe is that good and more!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was very inspirational and had lots of facts I had never heard off. Also, this served as nice refresher to most of the stuff I had read in school / colleges.<br /><br />Great book to read...
B00DYFCYSO|3.0|I think it is a good album, maybe it has to grow on you?! The jury is still out. I tried listening to different songs individually, and they seem better, maybe it's just my taste? I love his voice!!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am enjoying every episode and each night can't wait to watch the next one.  Relaxing way to spend the evening. The characters are so real and the actors are great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Kept me hooked the entire time. Fantastic read for the second book of the series. Can't wait to start the third book. Suzanne Collins has has lost me into a book again. I felt as if I was right there with katniss the entire time.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Exceeded my expectations!  Works great!  Looks great!  Would highly recommend.  Protects the Kindle screen nicely, and works great while standing.  Such a simple design.,
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Very good movie very well worth the money. I will be buying it soon. My son wanted to watch it over and over again
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Do not want to miss a minute! I can't wait until the next episode, or season.  I just love how classy Alicia is.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Better than his role as the Doctor.  David Tennant is brilliant, you can't help but root for the DI so he can vindicate himself! Awesome story line where everyone is a suspect!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin's epic continues.  The characters neglected in Book Four receive their due in Book Five.  Favorites live or die or appear to die.  Dragons become more than house pets.  If one has read the first four books, one must read this one too - and look forward to the next installment.
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|y wont u download to kindle fire stupid app I really want it but it keeps saying I don't have enough space even though I cleared out almost all my apps. urg
B00FPM4IRO|1.0|In a quest to find the latest and greatest game to test on my new phone, I found an exciting review of this game on a prominent mobile gaming site.  After downloading and installing and running the game, I'm stuck at the title screen where the main character is asleep in a chair.  No amount of touching, tapping, swiping, or stylus use will wake him from his slumber.  I'd like a refund if possible or a prompt update so I can play what looks to be an awesome game on my brand new high-end smartphone!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham has a perfect formula: Start off with a plausible sympathetic character and  build an equally strong plot. The Racketeer immediately becomes a \\"good read\\" and in time your heart is racing along with the adventure.  I was entertained until the last page was read.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|This was my favorite Star Trek so far. They tied the storyline perfectly into the series. Well done! I recommend a large popcorn and a comfortable seat. You won't want to get up.
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Very good, not my favorite of the 3, but still entertaining. The story is not as strong as the special effects, but worth the watch.
B005PK57NU|5.0|The cases are excellent. Sorry I'm get tired of typing. I don't think I'll rate anything else anytime soon. Too many words are required. It says I've used enough but I want to make sure. Two plus two equals four and it should. There are a lot of things that add up and they should. I'm done. I like this program. The Good Wife. You may not. But I do. I hope my review helps.

B001AQQR2S|5.0|I remember reading the book and though movies are not as good, this was a very good interpretation.  Great for kids.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Series was suggested by brother and after just a couple episodes I was hooked. Can't wait to see new episodes.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I personally think this game is too addicting to kids... I am finding that I have to fight with my son to stop playing it... grrr :(
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Always check it to figure out what to wear.  I live in CO and finding out the forcast is a must!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Rejoice King fans - the best yet has arrived! Loved the Doc. Thought about re-reading the Shinning before starting this and I still will re-read but no worries if you haven't read it already as it is a great stand alone read.<br /><br />King transports you with his storytelling. Empathy,terror,love...the range of emotions he carries you through is amazing. I want more now!!!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|You saw the film.  The film was like a religious experience for you.  Well so it will be with the album.  Can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Also one reviewer thought the Stevie Nicks track was the worst.  Are they deaf?  Incredible.  I suspect the musicians on her song are not as credited on the sleeve - either that or they are master impersonators.
B00EO4SBSG|3.0|When you have a producer, especially a big influential person like David Draiman, they tend to take control of the bands they, well. Take under their wing so to speak. Much like Bob Rock totally changed Metallica. Good for them bad for fans. Well I must say Draiman was a HUGE influence on this record from the Disturbed type riffs (which some are very good) although others you can tell don't have much Trivium in them. Also the choruses which there are ones that sound like they came straight from a Disturbed record, with faster heavier music behind it. Almost every song has the Disturbed trade mark of some kind, along with Trivium. But enough to please hardcore fans? Probably not. I myself have never been a \\"hardcore fan\\", just a fan of some of there tunes. I did like The Crusade and it's mixture of Metallica with some metalcore, but then again some was a bit much. Shogun was a great effort and showed off the bands musical chops like no one had every heard since the first album. With In Waves we got more of a straight forward almost \\"radio friendly\\" Trivium with some heavy riffs thrown in. Which was fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />So is this album a direct clone of Disturbed, well no, but I do think they definitely let Draiman call way to many shots on most songs. It's not me saying this, the music speaks for itself, just listen and compare. Or don't, and you'll still hear it. I actually thought Draiman was singing on some of the tracks!! So if your a long time hardcore fan you'll like some of it, or hate it all together. There isn't much of a grey area, unless your objective about them. Which most aren't. So if you have an open mind you'll dig it, if not you'll say oh lord this sucks. But as I said judge for yourself, mine is just an opinion, of a messenger who listens to the bands \\"somewhat\\". I've heard all they have to offer and this is what they offer in 2013, a good solid metal album, with maybe to much of a \\"Disturbing\\" ingredient. ;o)
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Clearly explains science around behavioral learning, with direct applications to changing habits for ourselves and for others.<br /><br />Minus one star for a glaring technical error - says Paul O'Neill began at Alcoa in 1987, later describes his actions as occurring in the early 80s.
B00992CF6W|5.0|cool. I am an minecraft guy it is great<br />I can ....well it is cool<br />just cool c o o l cool!!<br />lol minecraft lol minecraft.<br />minecraft is gooooood!!!!!<br />minecraft is the best!!!!<br />well still minecraft.-
B009E3EXMU|5.0|If you don't mind quick shot editing, and you're a Led Zeppelin fan, this is a must have. We all know how legendary this concert was. In my opinion this version of Kashmir is the best one. This is just such an emotional concert for them and for the fans. Plant starts a bit rough and you're thinking, 'Oh god, here we go again.' But, as his voice warms up and the crowd gives more and more moral support, the band is just RIGHT back there in the 70's. It couldn't have happened without Jason, who is not John, but he'll do. You know it had to be a family affair. I hope they never tour and go out on top with this awesome concert. No respectable Zep fan would be without this album.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This games is awesome in everyway. If you don't have it get it asap. graphics are on point feels like 3D, resembles the movies, and its completely funny.
B000B589JI|5.0|I carry the County Comm Maratac peanut lighter, so I bought this canister for my EDC to supplement that lighter. This works very well and I find I don't suffer any evaporative loss of the zippo fluid with this item. I would never consider carrying a Zippo without this.
B006PIXKVW|5.0|A great film for all ages. There are some departures from the book, but the characters and actors make it work. A classic!
B000LN7HUC|5.0|What is there to say about Trangia...it's practically bomb-proof. I love how everything packs together and the Trangia alcohol stove is so much neater than campfire cooking.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|I've seen the stage version, had to watch the movie version made from it, and though it suffers slightly from not seeing it on a large screen, it still packs a punch for its Bernstein music, backed by a remarkable cast & crew.  Memorable numbers, all.  Some people feel the romantic male lead was inappropriately cast, but I found him passably good all the same.  If you only purchase a handful of musicals for future appreciation, be sure this is among them; it's a keeper that never ages.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is one of the saddest book I ever read In my life ; but at the same time show u so much about life friends and how people  life can change in hours.<br /><br />I will recommend this book to any one now I'm reading the second part
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was the perfect way to catch up on the season I missed.<br />Just a few more months to Season 4
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Just love the book, even though Anne dies tragically young.  The book is a good read and was very hard to put down until the end.
B008V8FVTI|4.0|Good movie, difficult to watch at times because of the nature of some of its scenes but powerful and moving.
0425263916|5.0|Great book! Loved the whole trilogy.  Could not put it down.  Looking forward to reading the next one.  Highly recommend!
0671015206|5.0|Just got this and read it at the recommendation of my Financial Counselor.<br /><br />Its very practical and statistically driven. Can't say that I will be able to add much beyond what's been previously stated, I do think it a worthy read for the non-financially educated individual.
B009F1DIOK|5.0|Totally worth the price. I never get tired of these movies! Can't wait to get The Hobbit: Extended Edition on my Kindle!!
B005PWPUW6|5.0|It worked as advertised to convert digital sound to analog which allows me to use my wireless headphones with my new tv.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I love the &#34;Walking Dead&#34; series and I think I've nearly worn out the Third Season in preparing for Season 4!  I enjoy rewatching my favorite movies and TV series and &#34;Walking Dead, Season Three&#34; is a perfect addition to my collection.
B005R32L66|1.0|Skype is a wonderful program once you can get it installed.  I know this because I used it on my daughters android tablet, which I also have.  However, after an initial problem in obtaining the country code, I was successful, or so I thought from the welcome message!  When I tried to resign in, both my pin and username was rejected.  Messages indicate, Can't be found in data base and pin is incorrect.  The help screen advises that I need to sign up using my phone!  My daughter who is in South Carolina and has had skype is totally unaware of this requirement.  The app still appears on my android tablet, but I can't sign in.  I would appreciate any help you can provide.  Thank you!
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie centers around a group of children who are united through a terror experienced at a young age and have promised to &#34;come running&#34; if &#34;IT&#34; ever appears again - and, of course, &#34;IT&#34; does!  I enjoy traveling back and forth in time to build each person's character and their dedication to help each other through difficult and scary times.  It's quite a long movie and I enjoy every minute of it.  The actors are great and Stephen King's ideas are always unique.
B005PK57IK|4.0|I ran out of Episodes of Mad Men and Breaking Bad and latched on to Good Wife. I wish Kalinda  and Cary would get a spin off.Not as supenseful as Breaking Bad.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|Loved every son'tg. Its totally refreshing to hear something fresh, hardly predictable and just dang unique from anyone yet a 16 year old. She is either a prodigy or just an old soul in a young body...I commend her on her style, articulation and interesting structure of her addictive music. Very good investment on my part too...<br />;')
B000FBJAEG|5.0|and another good book by the author. I have read 5 of his and all good. Great plot and suspense
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun for all ages if you are a Minion fan! Even my 5 year old plays! Hope more gets added to it soon.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I really enjoyed this charming foray into what it is like to be a very high functioning Aspie who wants to be loved. An academic geneticist, his endeavour to find the perfect mate and to also help a friend find her biological father coalesce into good romantic fun. The writing is delightful, and includes a few digs at modernism and reductionism along the way, with many wonderful characters and situations thrown into the mix.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was awesome I love it so pictures and journal entries you will love this book to or at least I hope you do
B004NELBPC|1.0|This app works about half the time. Slideshows don't fully load. Videos are not supported. Stories don't ways load. Frustratingly inconsistent.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I liked very much to read this book. It was easy reading, very descriptive, you could actually feel yourself in the prison. It is a true story, but I'd rather read a more raw prison experience which is more common. People saw her as someone who didn't belong there so they were not as aggresive and non-friendly as probably should have been with other people.
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|I was waiting for the book to turn and for Greg to not always be this negative, cynical brat.... But he is.  No, life isn't rainbows and sunshine all the time, but one whining, lame, life sucks story one after another....  Good grief - Greg could use a trip to the shrink to talk through his issues.  Not exactly the story I want to be reading with my son at night.<br /><br /> I wish I could return Kindle books.  I'm confused - did they give the movie a plot and the Greg character a range of emotions?  There's no way this series can be this popular, yet this bad.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I can't stop watching the movie, My dvd player stoped working now I got to get a new DVD Player wow.
B002M9WW30|5.0|These are the kinds of movies that you go back to watch over and over. Great collection. Who doesn't like to watch the under dog rise to fame.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I've had this book for awhile but once I got in it I couldn't put it down. Loved it and you will also.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|wasn't going to rate the game but wouldn't stop bugging me and it filled my notifications up.37 notifications (to many )
B00ECUARO8|4.0|I liked it. Not some cookie cutter movie. All actors did a great job and story was worth the watch.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was my first read by this author. I was completely hooked from start to finish and read until the early hours of the morning on a work night to finish! The story line itself was a bit outside my norm of new adult romance, but I'm so glad I took a chance with this one. I am looking forward to more by this author.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Out of the 240,000 who died in the Tsunami, this family's story reveals clearly that God and his angels were watching out for them.
B0058OUJA4|1.0|nopenot much fun, didn't like it. not much fun to play. Quite silly. Boring. Hated it even though  was free
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|I am glad that I purchased this movie and had a chance to see it restored on blu ray.<br />It sparked my intrest after I saw the new In to darkness movie<br />They did a nice job
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this and it helps me sleep :-)  I'm a home health nurse and my patients like it too
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|i loved this movie.<br />I loved the actors especially love chris pine<br />the special effects were great and I enjoyed it
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm a nut for new technology, so HAD to give this a shot, and much to my surprise it works great.  I can stream anything from my computer, but selection is somewhat restricted from my iPad and iPhone, but it's really great to stream Netflix and Youtube to the TV while sitting across the room.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|A lot has happened in between season 3 and season 4! Great start... kept me on the edge of my seat!
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is good movie for kids to watch them, thay own both VHS & DVD. DVD played very good too. Thank you & have a good day!!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I almost never write reviews, but I wanted to for White Noise. I use this app every single night. It helps to tune out background noises for this otherwise extremely light sleeper. 5 stars!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The chromecast works (most of the time) as intended but as of the writing of this review it does not have much support.  While using a tablet to put Netflix on the TV with chromecast it does allow you to do other things on the tablet with Netflix still broadcasting to the TV in the background, so that's nice.
0763644765|3.0|Not what I expected, but it was okay.  It came on time, but the baby was already potty trained.  I will pass this book on to someone who is potty training their kid.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The installation went  quickly but then I had a problem due to my own misunderstanding. I was unable to get the Google chrome tech people , could not find a number, so I called Netflix. The tech from Netflix patiently got me past my blunder. The system is working beautifully now.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Wore one out and needed another so got two for 2 locations i dont have anything else to say goodbye
B009LDD1X0|5.0|We have a every season so far and lover the show.  We watch the new episodes of it every Thursday
B00915G6NK|5.0|I am such a fan & loved this dvd.  it arrived in a timely manner & I'm becoming a fan of amazon.com for items I cannot find in stores at the time I'm wanting it.  My son uses amazon.com & introduced me to using it.  I've not been disappointed in any order I've rec'd.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This is one screwed up story! Don't get me wrong, it's well written, but scares the crap out of me! When someone asked me about what I was reading I couldn't even explain it...
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|Madonna shows consistently set the standards for modern concerts and performance art, and MDNA is no different.  We are privileged to witness a living legend at her best.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Although not a Sheryl Crow fan, I am enjoying her transition into country music.  There are a lot of good songs on this album.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy the game very much. I have finally found a Bingo game that I really like and will keep playing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I learned quite a lot about the life and times of Jesus from this book.  I do think that the actual historical evidence is mingled with a great deal of opinion.  The author's opinion that Jesus sought to be a political as well as spiritual Messiah is founded on a lot of \\"he must have\\" and \\" it seems very likely\\" statements.  Still, it is good to have differing perspectives to ponder.  Paul seems to be depicted as rather an ego driven man, rather than a man of zealous conviction.  One does come to appreciate what a complex time this was, and the confusion of multiple \\"messiahs\\" , constantly shifting political rulers and the seemingly questionable role of the Temple as the center of the true faith are not topics studied in Sunday school, but do add depth to the story and served to increased my awe at the fact that Jesus's church survived at all.<br /><br />,,
B00005JMCN|5.0|This was such a good story. Horses are always a great topic to do movies about, they are so loveable.
B005AVIZ6U|3.0|Bought the book on a recommendation from a friend. Easy reading and interesting. Went on to read more in the series
B00ET7ICEQ|4.0|One of her best that i have ever heard I'm glad she made this album my friends also enjoyed it
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Bought the second book just as I was interested in the ending. A bit weak and  skipped lots of pages
1937248283|5.0|Just stumbled upon Courtney Milan and the Brother Sinister set they are great!--- fast paced story lines with characters you will fall in love with. I cant wait for the next book to find out whats going on with Sebastian please write quicker. What sets Ms. Milan apart in the historical romance set is her head on battle with real problems its not all parties and carriage rides for these heroines. So check out a author that can dish out some emotion but not leave you feeling as you have been ran over by a truck.
B009GEDP26|5.0|Favorite show favorite season. The whole family really digs this show and we can't wait to watch it every night. I recorded it to the DVR and thought I would save some cash, but, after one episode I got it on Amazon. Way better streaming it. Picture quality is better too.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|how do u get the monkey that throws bananas and collects the bananas from the banana farms someone used one in coop mode and ive never seen one
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome!  Love Downton!  Can't wait for Season 4!  I laughed, I cried...I cried even more!  So good!  Genius writing. Amazing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show, you will get addicted and won't be able to stop watching it. I have no idea how people come up with this stuff but it keeps you on your toes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining. Need a laugh or to unwind? I'd recommend this game. It's also a wonderful compliment to the movie.
B000RGSOR8|4.0|When Mike Garson is playing the piano, it all just start to sound like Aladin Sane. But this is why St. Vincent is different than other female songwriters, even in the same genre.
0143118757|5.0|Very good book, amazing introduction to the negotiation world. I really enjoyed it, I would recommend it to anyone. Good luck!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Enjoyed this novel.  Nothing like Harry Potter so know that before you read it.  JK Rowling is a wonderful writer.  Her insight into human nature is so interesting.  Will continue to read any novels that she writes.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I've had Kik on previous devices but recently tried to download it on my Kindle. It would let me login or create a new account, saying there was an error and it was taking too long. I've been pleased with the app before but this is extremely frustrating. Please fix this as soon as possible.
0765325950|5.0|I have been a faithful reader of these books for the last 15 years and it has been a beautiful journey.  I was very pleased with how the series ended...I'm only heartbroken that it's finally over!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I think you will like it if you try it. It tells me story about the person the author Austin Klein. It's silly. It's weird. It's cool.
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|Normally the other Madonna’s DVDs  has the behind the scene included I was disappointment that the is nothing or back stage on this DVD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it. play it for hours. this is my new favorite game. perfect game for all ages. I don't even play any other games
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This is the perfect family movie. We laughed the entire time. It was a nice ending to a long day. I will definitely purchase this movie.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It used to work but now it doesn't let me login otherwise it'd be a 5 star app. They need to fix it on kindle
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love it it's so good with graphics and no lag servers unless ur internet bad it's like lol or dota 2 but u can bring it on the go unlikely dragging a desktop or a laptop you can just pull out ur phone and play on a road trip walking around the house all around deserves the five stars
B0016OVEYA|5.0|doesnt really follow the plot of the book, but still manages to capture the essence of it. great visual effects and a solid cast in this film
B00992CF6W|5.0|my daughter loves this game so much she plays with her friends all the time. Can't get her to stop!
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|the entire movie was dull - the characters are likeable, but it's time to retire this genre - it's laughable to the point of being so cheezy, especially when the kid smiles up at the air - (kids don't do this - come on)
B005PK56TA|5.0|I started watching this series last year and missed the first year. I went back and watched the first season and it is awesome!!!
B005PK553C|5.0|Awesome! So creepy, & those ghosts are wicked.  Can't wait to see season 2! You have GOT to see it!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Read more than, great book enjoy I would recommend to all great book to enjoy with family a great book to share with the young and older members alike
B004SOR4H6|1.0|Not too sure how it works but don't really use it anyway. Facebook is better, on there more than anything.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is the best game ever you can even get new characters can't wait to see what will be next on subway surfers
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|First movie was really good and this one is even better!  Can't wait to get a 3D TV to watch it in 3D!!!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It was a little slow at the beginning but picked up.  I intend to read more of the series.  Recommended
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I like all three of the Iron Man movies and this just completes the set.  Can't wait to get a 3D TV so I can watch that version!
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I didn't think she could get much better but no. She has gotten better with each new CD. This one rocks and rolls and her ballads are gorgeous. Buy it if you're looking for something a wee bit different!
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|This type of show is what I enjoy most -- does not relate to anything in the real world.  Just good entertainment.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I like Queen. I like Styx. I like Deep Purple. Hours of it, not so much. But my wife is a total Freddie fan so this one hit the spot for her. It is one of the best collections out there. If you're a Queen fan, then this is for you.
B0032W2QUU|3.0|Kind of hard to get into this story line -- doesn't quite hold my attention like some of the other sci-fi movies and series.  Maybe that's because I've seen pieces of it through the years and already know the gist of the show.
B001EC0OMW|4.0|I caught this movie on TCM recently and was glad I did.  If, like me, you have a certain aversion to the garish Hammer films of the 1960's, this movie will go a long way to a reevaluation of them.  This movie is also right up there with the Tod Browning 1931 offering with Bela Lugosi, and the later Francis Ford Coppola update with Gary Oldman as the tortured Count (although none of these is as scary as the silent NOSFERATU with Max Schreck) .  In HORROR OF DRACULA, Terence Fisher had the advantage of having Christopher Lee playing Dracula and the really excellent Peter Cushing stealing every scene as Professor Van Helsing.  Not having read Bram Stoker's novel, I cannot comment on how close this movie is to the book but really, with a movie this good, who cares?  The story hums along quite nicely with no annoying longeurs to bog it down.  The actors are enthusiastic (Michael Gough turns in a good performance as well), production values are really good, and there are some really scary moments.  If you like old scary movies with great actors, this movie is for you.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|Finally decided to watch Harry Potter and it's fantastic! I can't wait to purchase the other movies in the series and watch the characters and storyline grow.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|This film was a pleasant surprise.  The storyline does the job (origin story) and the production values are top notch.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|I chose this rating because the character of Hannibal is totally presented in a different light.  In contrast to the movies, this prequel renders somewhat of a different side of Hannibal--the start, just before he enters prison.  He is an established psychologist, yet, the series goes into depth about his cannibalism and the victims he consumes with specific body parts.  The Will Graham character played by Hugh Dancy works good in this series too.  Mads Mikkelson plays an excellent psychopath; interesting, intriguing, compassionate but a stone cold killer.  If you want something to move you, this series will do it.
B00FFVB2DI|5.0|This show is awesome, in the truest sense of the word.  The writers consistently turn out excellent episodes.  Overall, the show is maturing into a very sophisticated and nuanced &#34;laugh out loud&#34; comedy.  Simply amazing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read Enders Game and the rest of the series back in 1985, thanks to the Science Fiction Book Club. Loved  it back then, and love it now. Very intriquing book about using children in a 'game' battle situation.<br /><br />This was one of the first novels that used the premise of 'gamers' as warriors. Very well written, full of action and adventure, as well as personal situations that make the characters.<br /><br />This is the story of Ender as he attempts to save humanity, and his trials that lead up to that point. A lonely genius, isolated as to be mechanical in his thought process. Ender excels in everything he puts his mind to. He learns early about the value of friuendships, and how to control his emotions when dealing with 'work'<br /><br />This book is a must read for all sci fi and fantasy readers...
B007BVOEPI|1.0|I was looking forward to this show.  What I discovered was Syfy production values, generic storylines, and incest.  No thanks.
076790592X|5.0|Purchased book for optional reading for nursing school end of life class. Saw a movie before, but holding a book allows you to re-read catchy phrases and memorable events. Easy read and very edifying! Must read-it allows you to appreciate life and be thankful what all you have and don't have.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As a retired Naval Aviator I have read many books on flying in combat, this is one of the best.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was philosophical and interesting and different BUT was missing a real plot. There was nothing that made the book something that drew me in. Almost every big conclusion was easily predicted. It was a beautiful story and I appreciated how smart the characters were. (As for whether their language was realistic for teens, I think it is plausible since not every teenager is a vapid hormone driven relationship hopper the way most other major media depicts.) I DID like that the teens weren't typical. I loved that they were smart and while it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, this book did give me a very sweet and thoughtful slice of life story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It worlks both on my Ipad and Window 7, after you downloaded free app for each system respectively, great for Netflix and Youtube, I watched youtube a lot so this thing helps a lot casting on to 52&#34; HDTV.  This is very simple product, and the picture quality is as good not bad, you see way better for youtube on the big screen.  It works good on windows 7, page by page loading, as normal browsing, but the Ipad only works Netflix and Youtube.<br />Anyway, some people like some don't, for me it is good product to watch netflix and youtube on big screen for $ 35 !
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|AMAZING! Straight to my \\"Favorites\\" shelf. Wow....<br />2 misfits + one shared seat on a bus = LOVE<br /><br />Poor Eleanor. Her life was so extremely sad. My heart broke for her. I loved her. She was such a great character. I wanted to rescue her and save her and show her that life isn't the way she was having to live.<br /><br />Park...awww Park, you are a doll.<br /><br />First love. Experiencing this ride with them was magical. The slow build to first love between these two was perfect. I 'felt' what they felt. I got butterflies. I felt the hurt. I felt the concern...I felt all of it. I bawled ugly crocodile tears at the end. I'm still reeling. I can't stop thinking about this story.<br /><br />Recommend for all!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great read. Never sure where its gonna end up. Looked forward to the next book. I definitely would recommend it!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift for an out-of-town friend.  He is a huge fan of the show and already has Seasons 1-7.  He was thrilled to receive Season 8 and watched the entire Eighth Season in one day.  A Supernatural marathon!  He's already asking when Season 9 will be released.  This gift was a Big Hit!!!
B002VUFKG6|5.0|After reading Eat,Pray, Love, I felt. I had to read, Committed, A Love Story.  What I enjoy about these two books by E. Gilbert, is that interspersed with her life is not only anecdotal tidbits of history, but truly thought provoking information that gave me much to consider about life in general, but also about how our past (as in social and historical history) has formed who we are today and today will certainly form future generations.  Not only well written, but entertaining.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Am really please with the way the app is so user friendly. Anyone can use it and use it well. It is simple.
0792163710|4.0|A great movie. A real classic. I remember when it first came out. It should be on tv more often.
B009DZDJU6|3.0|Silly movie, but not as bad as I thought it would be. I wouldn't  rush out to watch it, but if your running out of movie ideas, this isn't a bad pick.
0061715050|5.0|The book was in great conditions and meet my expectations big time and it also came in time. So happy camper.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Before I picked this book up, I didn't even realise there was such a thing as erotic poetry! Now I know differently and have been converted.<br />This collection is beautifully written and breath-taking with how the poet manages to convey such sensual feelings and images with so few words.<br />Despite the title, any lover of poetry cannot fail to be impressed with the skill of this writer in his ability to use poetry to create such beauty on the page.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Fun for kids for ages 5 to 8.  Hours of entertainment for 99 cents.  Beware of in game sales and auto billing
B00D82BNLC|5.0|This book had an amazing ability to have me wondering where the border between fiction and reality really was. The narration is so absorbing, frightening and real that it truly reads like an account of real events.<br /><br />Ghostly phenomena are something which have been growing in popularity and have always managed to grip the interest of nations. This story draws on that obsession to discover the truth about ghosts and bodily possessions.<br /><br />This is a clever tale, focused around an investigation at an institution where even the ambulance crew refuse to attend.<br /><br />Combined with a tragic, yet believable main character, this story is captivating and grips the reader until the very last page.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Amazing, a classic, will always love!<br />Always, always a great movie to watch over and over again.<br />Highly recommend!<br />Wonderful!
0756655307|5.0|This was exactly what I was looking for.  My daughter has been intrigued by the origins of various superhero's and this encyclopedia was perfect!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I wasn't sure I even wanted to read this book based on the synopsis, but after reading so many good things from friends, I decided to give it a whirl. It started out slow, and at first I wasn't a fan. I didn't like that these teens talked in a way teens never would. The language and vocabulary was just not realistic.<br /><br />Soon, though, the story of Hazel Grace and Augustus overshadowed my dislikes and I became wrapped up in the love story. It keep me wanting to read more. Eventually, my emotions got to me and I cried as I finished the last few chapters. John Green does a great job of pulling at your heart strings. Definitely a recommended quick read.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|It was the first time we watch an Amazon film online, it was great, the kids and me enjoyed it.<br />The stream was fast, the picture is net.
0307279189|5.0|i'm not a distance runner but these stories make me want to go for a long jog to the end of the earth.  somehow everything seems more natural where running is concerned.  all information about the sport and the body packaged with the most fascinating anthropological stories and thrilling storytelling i've ever read.  and i read classic fiction most of the time.  great writing, and so inspiring.  thankS!!
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Classic movie, even better in HD. Still hilariously funny after a long time of not watching it. You will not be disappointed.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It won't let me log in. I moved to a new school, and I'm still trying to stay in touch with my old friends. So this app isn't like the rest - if temple run stopped working I would get over it, but kik actually impacts my life. Thanks a lot. If I miss out on a trip to six flags with them, or a pool party<br />with some hot babes...Dear Lord, stop my wrath. How hard is it to let people log in? I have things to say.
B00EO4SBSG|5.0|I was not thinking it would be this good. They really stepped it up with Vengence Falls. Great riffs solid mid section very good vocals without compromising any of thier sound. Well woth the money. BEST RELEASE TO DATE!!!
B008BM9L72|5.0|I did not think this was going to be my kind of book however I had to see what all the fuss was about! Wow I'm so impressed love the storyline find myself with a smile on my face when I think about it!  I would however recommend that one reads it if you are married just makes the whole experimenting process legal...
B009IRVSVQ|1.0|I bought the cd to listen to\\" when I was your man\\".  I listed to the whole cd. I listened to gorilla, now I know why 80 students in one school in my area are pregnant. Does Bruno Mars think 18 year olds are the only people who purchase his cd's?  Well I know I will not be buying any more.  The cd is vulgar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|One of the best. Plenty of options and filters and easy to use. Just lacking that something special and unique to really set it apart. This is a great app!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is cute and age appropriate for kids to play instead of temple run. Plus I love the different arenas esp. the residential halloween level
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This is going to be a classic album with songs that will never get old! This is my first Taylor album and it was great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought it would be a great escape read for a long flight--and it did not disappoint.  Lots of twists and turns and a good surprise ending.  Thought Flynn captured the voices of certain kind of &#34;cool&#34;, 30-something,self absorbed New Yorkers,  (technically Park Slope, Brooklyn), but Park Slope was never like that when I grew up in Brooklyn!<br /><br />Good movie material-too bad Hitchcock is dead.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|He is a genius! I love his music and of course this is another great album to add to my collection!
0316776963|5.0|Great writer. Absorbing, funny, poignant. This is not a happy book. So be ready for that. but worth the read
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written and easy to relate to the characters.  And just when it seems to be getting predictable, the<br />paths take some interesting turns.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I must say, it's my least favorite of the series of Iron Man. I liked the first and second one much much more.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|I wasn't too sure about the movie....I was worried it would be depressing. It turned out to be a fun movie to watch.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Not many movies make me cry, but this one made me cry, everytime I watch it, I can't help but bust out a tear or two. It's a great film.
0321701763|5.0|I like all the Classroom in a book. They are awesome teaching aids. I would recommend this to anyone who needs to learn Photoshop.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|You have to like slow but good movies to like this one. It's not a fast paced movie, but it's got great actors, and a pretty good story board.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|It was a nice break from reality.  Fun and well edited.  The special effects were well done also.  I would recommend it - especially on an Amazon Prime account where you can watch it for free!!!!
B000GT6L9Y|5.0|I watch this movie very often, like once a month. Great family movie, great story, and morals in the movie. Watch with your family.
B002M9WW30|5.0|My brother is a fan of Rocky and I buy to him. He is very satisfied with the item. The package is great!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|I must say I hate to say it was even a ok movie. I will never watch it again, if you thought roots was rough, then this movie will just make you want to turn it off immediately. Rough, I mean ROUGH scenes.
B003E88TKS|4.0|Good movie to watch alone. Funny, inspirational, creatively developed characters, and is, I think, a pretty good story assessing the life you want, the life you have, and the priorities you develop in between.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|This one is overall a great movie. My only beef is the slow parts, where you almost must fast forward to keep your interest in it. But, the music and scenes are off the chart cool.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This one is the best. It has a little of everything in it, along with good lessons about life. If you haven't seen it, you need to!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Every moment spent reading this book was a joy. Erin's writing is beautifully descriptive and charms you from the start. She paints very detailed scenery down to the taste and smells. This book has a lovely element of magic which I hold dear to my heart. I will forever be a Reveur!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game so much, myself and my two daughters love it, a game for all ages, even a six year old and a thirteen year old love it
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|Great movie for family with kids over 10. My wife and I liked the movie very much. Kept us engaged without being offended. It reminded me of myself when I was kid wondering around rivers and forest and finding odd things including living quarters for homeless just getting by.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Very addictive!  Easy to play, yet hard to master.  Perfect for when you are bored or just don't feel like doing anything.
B00DZP3KJ0|3.0|Scott Kelby's books are great.  I've got his Lightroom 3 book in the Dead Tree version and it is fantastic - 5 stars.<br /><br />I'm sure this Lightroom 5 book is just as good.  I've only given this Kindle version 3 stars because the eBook version is just not as good as the real printed version.  This was my first real non-fiction book for an ereader and I was just disappointed with the result.<br /><br />I've already purchased the printed version as a replacement.
B008RKGFTK|5.0|After all these years I still enjoyed watching American Gigolo.  It was my very first rated \\"R\\" movie and I was like \\"wow\\" who is that guy....Richard Gere! I fellfor him and followed his films for many years after that! I enjoyed American Gigolo's storyline from beginning to end, more this time around, considering I'm more mature now than I was back then. :)  Cool 80s movie, with a great song attached...\\"Call Me\\" by Blondie! 30+ years later it still gets 5 stars from me! (with two thumbs up).
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely but get out the Kleenex..It has some sad moments but it is a richly written book about a young girl and a romance that touches the heart of the reader...I liked this book so much, I read &#34;The Girl You Left Behind,&#34; and thought it couldn't be better, but it was...I'm now a huge fan of JoJo Moyes...She is so young to come up with such fabulous plots! Can't wait to see what comes next from her creative mind!
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|Good special effects, somewhat predictable - OK (but not great!).  Strict authoritarian Dad, son wanting to live up to Dad's example, yada yada yada.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Just when you think you've figured it out, it wiggles around and goes somewhere completely different. Makes you think about all those shocking stories in the news, and monsters in human form.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It was a pretty easy read. I had a hard time putting the book down.  It has a nice twist in the end.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|This game is a lot of fun on my desktop computer.  I thought I could download it to play on my Kindle Fire but found out that it is not possible to do that.  Played the few steps on the kindle that I could but don't want to pay for the game all over again when I already paid for it for the computer.  Should be able to download to my Kindle!!!  I love the game!
B00CATSONE|4.0|NICE AND INTERSTING ABOUT THE LIFE OF A WISE MAN! ...BOOK I RECOMMEND IT... ESPECIALLY ABOUT THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE WRITTER!..
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|It's pleasant, heartwarming, insightful, and funny. What more do you want?<br /><br />If you enjoy James' writing, this book is definitely worth a read. Google his blog if you want a preview.

B0049PNOS2|5.0|I love Eros, his music, his personality, his warmth.  I Have seen him in concert once, and now I am getting to go again for my B-day!! WOW!!
B001NHNG64|2.0|I just can't get over the really horrible dialogue. Every single character sounds the exact same. But that's not the most annoying part. I can look past them sounding alike if they all sounded even remotely good. But everyone sounds like a 10 year old girl. A seasoned veteran chief field FBI agent (who use to<br />Be assistant director) in one scene when debating over where the white truck carrying holly went says something along the lines of this. \\"They can be anywhere by now. Maybe even a zillion miles away.\\" WTF is that? What FBI agent is going to say something so childish and dumb like that. It is beyond absurd. I wanna meet the assistant director of the FBI in real life and see if when trying to solve important cases says things to his colleagues like \\"gee mike the bad guy could be a trillion-zillion miles away by now. What ever are we to do, right?\\" \\"Gee wiz bill you are right. Idk what to do now.\\"<br />The author even have the mindset of these FBI agents to be so dumb and childish that it just really ruins the books for me.<br />When the director of the FBI goes into the Joint Cheif of Staff office to tell him that his daughter has been kidnapped they have him thinking about how unfair it is that the man has a nicer office then he does and how it's unfair that he gets to<br />Meet the president once or twice a week when he himself only sees him once or twice a year. Yeah I think the director of the FBI will have more intellectual matters and concerns on his mind then worrying about how much nicer someone else office is.<br /><br />I loved the first book In the series it was great I even like the short choppy sentences. I feel they for reachers character well, but having it in third person jumping from person to<br />Person in short chops is not good.<br />I will continue the series because Stephen King told me that it was a good series and that the books get better so I'll take his advice and hope it pays off.

B008P1EWIM|5.0|The title says it all. It tells you everything you need to know and the format is sweet and simple.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|So far it seems to be a pretty good game. I haven't been able to play it very long as of yet. Hopefully it will continue to be what it seems to be. You just have to figure out what to do in each scene.
B00455IVHU|5.0|Inspiring. It is just the way relationship should begin. Friends. Growing to love each other then wants more. But it takes two at the same time. And timing is everything.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|This game is really fun and keeps you busy. My mom always yells at me for not getting off this game haha.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I really like that there's a message. its not just a random game, the little music video askew you to stay safe around trains and there's a little button at the end where you can make a pleadge and everything g. This game is a little weird but I think its cool especially for kids.
B001GSTOAM|4.0|A lot of good points, though I don't agree with all of them. Some examples were a bit dull and required some mathematical knowledge.
B00428LIXO|4.0|Good but it's too thick to hold for my baby<br />I love this hammer's laugh<br />But it's little hard to make a sound fir my baby

B009LDCZ7I|5.0|A great show that keeps you one the edge of your seat.  You never know who is the good guy
B004WLA2GA|4.0|I liked this book very much, it exsplains a lot about the life of a boy who is grown now. but reallycannot give up his dark interself he is deeply  unsure of who he is.
B00CVV1FJ6|5.0|This album set my mind ablaze with all sorts of connective muses:)<br />What I mean is that it caught my heart and ear simultaneously erupting in a free flow joy...<br />or, simply brilliant in all it's pieces n parts.<br /><br />Primal Scream has ripped a masterpiece and is well; worth the shadow dance!!!
B00EO4SBSG|4.0|Sounds like Trivium, but also sounds like a more mature band.<br /><br />The production is great, the songs are really tight, it's an album of full-on metal, no fluff.<br /><br />Even the 3-star tracks are pretty impressive. But since the album starts with a bunch of these, you have to wait for the really good songs.<br /><br />Tracks that smoke:<br />* Villainy Thrives<br />* To Believe<br />* Incineration<br /><br />Fewest barked vocals since The Crusade, but the straightforward singing is at a far higher level.<br /><br />Overall on par with Shogun and Ascendancy, and a small step below In Waves.<br /><br />(Don't bother with the Special Edition - unlike In Waves, it has no great tracks)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Enjoyed this book so much and couldn't put it down. Its crazy how our actions can affect so many lives!
0385350864|5.0|I've only just read 7 pages of the book and absolutely cannot stop laughing!  I love how the book is written as though it were a movie and hoping so much that this book is made into a movie.  Honestly, did not read the other two books but have watched both movies so many times I have lost count!  Being someone who is single and divorced for the last 10 years, I can relate to at least part of what Bridget is and certainly who she is.  I am sad to hear of Mr. Darcy's demise but I am sure there is a pivotal reason that Ms. Fielding created this scenario.  Helen Fielding - if you do read my review - love your writing and wish my own could even compare!  I'd love to live in England to be surrounded by the people I read about whether they are fiction or real.  I live in New England and it isn't quite the same but I am obsessed with the UK and always have been.  Anyway, to all those naysayers and critics - you really should read this book from the perspective of a divorced or widowed \\"singleton\\" and you will see just how it really is.  Ms. Fielding must have a sense of humor that is completely amazing and would love to meet more people like that.  The book is great so far and cannot wait to get on it..........I am sure I will not be able to stop reading it until finished and then will want another!  Thank you so much for this book and the movies - they are amazing!

B008B1BL4E|5.0|I HAVE FOR MANY YEARS BEEN INTENTLY INQUISITIVE REGARDING THE EXPRESSED OPINIONS OF HISTORIANS AS TO THE UNDERLYING DYNAMIC THAT RESULTS IN WAR INDUCED DEVASTATION. WWI and WWII ARE OF particular interest to me given their occurrence in the first half of the 20th Century, in particular the responsible/important players in these devastating conflicts.
0374533571|4.0|Pat believes in happy endings. Even in the slightly messed up movie of his own life. When he can finally leave the bad place, Pat is sure that Apart Time with his beautiful wife is about to end. The movie has gone on long enough. It's time for his happy ending.<br /><br />To prove that Pat deserves his happy ending, he is doing all of the right things. He is trying to be kind instead of right. He is working out to get in better shape. He is reading literature so he and his wife will have things to talk about. He is even taking his meds (mostly).<br /><br />But while Pat is desperate for Apart Time to end, distractions keep getting in the way. First he meets Tiffany--who is crazy. Crazier that Pat by a lot. Who insists on being his friend. Then he somehow becomes a part of his family's complex game day rituals to cheer on the Eagles every Sunday.<br /><br />Then things get really weird. Kenny G--the man Pat fears above all others--keeps turning up at inopportune moments. He is somehow part of a dance recital. And the Eagles might not make it to the playoffs at all.<br /><br />Pat believes in happy endings. He knows he deserves his happy ending. What Pat doesn't know is what to do when the happy ending he hoped for is the exact opposite of the one he might get in The Silver Linings Playbook (2008) by Matthew Quick.<br /><br />If Matthew Quick is a rockstar writer, this book is his gold record complete with a cover (in the form of a movie adaptation).<br /><br />I saw the movie for my birthday earlier this year and I really loved it. After seeing One Day in theaters and watching a character get hit by a bus, I had been weary of \\"grown up\\" movies (and books for that matter) but after some research I determined there weren't any freak accidents in this story so I was good to go. Already being a fan of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, I was ready to be impressed by the movie. And I was. Everything worked and everything came together to make a charming and engaging story.<br /><br />Much later (because of the huge library hold queue) I was able to pick up a copy of the book that inspired the movie.<br /><br />There are quite a few differences. The plot was tightened up and stretched for the movie to make it more cinematic (and plot-driven since we can't just listen to Pat talk for two hours on-screen). The changes made sense and, above all, they worked for the new medium. The result was a book that was still gripping and incredibly well-written but a movie that was a bit more whimsical.<br /><br />While the film touches the surface of Pat and Tiffany's problems, the book shows that these characters are really broken. There are missing pieces, and parts that don't fit, and they're just trying to hold it all together one day at a time. That messiness isn't as prevalent in the movie.<br /><br />The main reason I enjoyed this book is its optimism. Pat's a mess. Tiffany is a disaster. But they're trying. They might even be learning. Along the way Pat has several pitfalls but he also makes friends and finally makes it to his own happy ending in a way that feels natural while still leaving room for the sense of wonder that Pat manages to find in even the smallest of silver linings.ory.<br /><br />Much later (because of the huge library hold queue) I was able to pick up a copy of the book that inspired the movie.<br /><br />There are quite a few differences.

B002ZG983M|5.0|Terrific cartoon-style live action fun.  Be warned though this is not a movie for the faint of heart. Its gory and violent with much of the violence involving children.  We watched it with our teenage kids (13 and 15) who loved it, saw the fun and were old enough to know it's just a story. Enjoy!
B0092C2X7U|4.0|press the screen a lot of times and stare at the bottom of your screen and thats all folks much fun!
B00447L4KA|4.0|This movie is a fun rendition of The Taming of the Shrew. It has some great dialogue and lovely performances by its young rising stars - Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles and Joseph Gordon Levitt.
B00EDLP6O2|4.0|The game is a fun game that has a lot to keep you busy.<br />Mini games for training.<br />Exhibition matches to earn money<br />A career mode<br />The game is fair when you are not strong enough to fight the next opponent it will let you know about it and when you try unless you are a real careful fighter you will lose.<br />Cool game with a lot of upside to it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I love historical fiction and this was a good book. It was a good blend of current events and past history
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|I was recommended to Lorde the day before this album released by a good friend of mine. So I bought this album the next day wondering why my friend gave her such appraise.<br /><br />Well, Lorde is most certainly not your typical artist. I find it astonishing that at her young age in the industry that she knows what type of music she is aiming for. I definitely respect the effort she put in this album! Her voice and beats reminded me a little of Ellie Goulding and Lana. Very catchy, very good songs on this album lyrically. I'm giving it 4 stars, not because it was in anyway bad. I would love to see some tweaks. We have to remember, she is 16. Plenty of time to make that perfect album. I think Lorde can definitely do it! Definitely look out for her for the next 3-4 years. Lorde is definitely going to make the record books.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack has ample room with solid construction, and plenty of storage options. I bought this based on price compared to some other options and it has worked out very well.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Joss Whedon has a unique skill of tiny reveals that weave together a character. Newcomers to Whedon's deft hand find The Avengers delightful, and firefly is where he honed this skill set to vibrancy.<br /><br />Fusing cultures, putting 'real people' in space, and perhaps a problem with authority.... Enjoy each episode... because it is all we got. There is a movie... in Serenity, you will see what makes River Tam a little crazy-- and there is a new comic coming!!! It will pick up after the movie.
B009S33I68|5.0|A gripping recount of the early years of the Vietnam conflict. Hard to put aside as the struggle the young men endure unfolds. Clearly depicts the horrors of war and and the wrack and ruin to both sides.  Makes everyday trials and tribulations mundane by comparision.
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game isn't a bad game. It's ok. Only thing I don't like is that the energy goes really fast.  It can get addictive
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Just a word to say this. Does anyone else see the possible influence of Joy Division in some, if not most of their compositions? Is it just me? I've not read anything directly from the band, but have been a 'distant' fan since \\"High Violet\\". Just sayin'
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried numerous keyboards and this has been the best one yet! Very highly recommended for any one that is looking for a better option

B00FPH6AXE|5.0|My husband and I just got done watching it and we both really liked it. I thought that Will Smith and his son did a great job. Worth the five bucks and a nights entertainment.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Just watched this this weekend and wow what a great movie!  Lots of smoke and mirrors to make you wonder what is going to happen next.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|One of the very best docs ever. Might even be better than the incredible Man On Wire. How can that be? Well, this is human interest at it's best, also because the main character/hero & his family/daughters are so damn decent and likable. You can't help but root for this man and his family. The problem with Man On Wire is just this, although the feat that little French dude pulls off in that flick is incredible--and could not have been accomplished without the sacrifices and help of his friends--dumps them all afterwards, cuts them out of his life. How do you do that? Was he a jerk in real life? Who knows?--but that rates as pretty despicable behavior in this reviewer's opinion. Does it take away from Frenchie's mind-boggling achievement? Absolutely not.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about that film--because Searching for Sugarman is as good, if not better--and I just stated why I think so.<br />So, is Dylan mild compared to Rodriguez?--(as at least one former music maven states in this documentary) Yep. I believe so. Listen to the voice, pay close attention to the lyrics.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|An awesome movie! Is very close to the book. It will make you think! It's a girly girl movie but worth watching. Very funny.
B005LAIH5O|3.0|Just wasn't that good and the first one was that good either. I only buy films like this for special affects because most of the story lines are really bad, the acting is bad must I go on.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It is not ready for local media yet. i still waiting for Google's actualization!!!! not good product, but there us not exist some kind product like gc
0812982622|4.0|I have to admit the author is an excellent writer. In this story he molds the life of one individual with the stories of many individuals who have lived in North Korea to give us an idea of what life is like in that strangest of countries. The North Koreans have truly been indoctrinated on how horrible the people in the United States are and the North Koreans literally hate the US. The North Korean establishment has done an excellent job in brain washing its people. The book seems so far fetched in the things it tells but they are based on true life incidents.
B000SCHC0Q|3.0|This is a well written, interesting book, but I am not going to read another story about such hideousness, if I can help it.  If there was a way for me to help, it might be different.
B00C5R8364|5.0|You hardly put this novel down when you start reading it. Frederick Forsyth is a legend & master of thriller.<br />Unbelievably peripheral real narratives. I love it.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|This is a rather sentimental look at a woman's year-long stay in a federal prison, including the friendships she made, the dehumanization of prisoners and the conditions she experienced while incarcerated. It is not very similar to the television series on Netflix, so if you're looking for similar exciting adventures, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />There are lots of female characters as prisoners come and go; I had a hard time keeping up with many of them (which may have been the point--she had friendships that lasted only the length of the imprisonment?) but none seemed strong enough to last the test of time once both the author and her jailmate left the prison.<br /><br />The strong emotional bond I sometimes feel when reading a really good book just wasn't there with this one: I didn't go into 'reading hangover' when I finished it.
B001NFU5WE|1.0|the movie is awsome but why only two stars, the case looks cheap and crapy,I dont put zero stars just because its not allowed, not only that it looks like a piece of something made by a two year old.  The worse part is that it has no menu!!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is one of the best books of the year.  An absolutely great read in a different kind of genre.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The legend, the story, could not be better.  It made great timing and the special features are awsome, but its impossible to mess up the best movie of all time
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I bought 3 motion-sensor night lights at the same time to determine which worked the best. This is the one.<br />I'll be buying more. I'm sort of a motion-sensor, night light collector. Just kidding about that part.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very well written. Enjoyed each of the characters and their own stories.I would recommend this book, and will read the author again.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|love the story and I am a huge fan from the first one when it was out. This one made him more god like =]
B006LSZECO|3.0|probably a good beach read -- it's obviously the Scott Peterson case, . . . with a twist . . . the ending is thought provoking . . . but really not the best written book . . .
B001EBV0OY|5.0|IT WAS JUST GREAT<br /><br />I SAW SO MANY SITUATIONS THAT I COULD IDENTIFY WITH PEOPLE OF TODAY AND<br /><br />WHERE WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP IN OUR HOPE AND DONT LET ANYTHING OR ANYONE STOP US FROM OUR DESTINY
B0009P5YXO|5.0|my wife is a Huge doctor who fan. When i ordered this as a gift for her i knew shed love it. When the package arrived she flipped out! she is now looking for a costume to go for halloween as the 11th doctor. short of buying an actual prop style sonic screwdriver, this doesnt get much better for the money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read a lot in this genre but after seeing the raving reviews, I thought I might give it a try. Wow! I was hooked. I have read a lot about writing and this guy knows what he is doing. He really pulls you into the story and the characters in a way that is unbelievable. You find yourself drawn into the lives of the characters without even realizing it and you just have to know more. I would think about it at night and wonder about the characters and their world. That is what a good novel and a good writer should do...make you keep thinking! My hat is off to you, Hugh Howey. A fantastic series.
0385742886|4.0|Before there was a maze, there was a world torn apart by wars and environmental disaster. The world fell apart with a bang, but a few lone souls tried to cling to the people they found and loved thanks to circumstance. In The Kill Order, James Dashner told us the tale of life before the maze.<br /><br />Mark and Trina were lucky enough to be in the subway when the flares began. Uncontrollable and completely devastating flares tore through the world, destroying everything unlucky enough to be in their wake. They know something is happening, but aren't sure what to do. When attacked by a group of homeless men, they have the incredible luck of being found by Alec, an ex-military survivalist who knows what is happening and how to survive it. But if they don't listen to him quickly, they too will be swept away and drowned by the incoming flash flooding and tsunami caused by the immediate destruction of the ice caps. But there are worse things out there than the sun and the water. Worse by far.<br /><br />It isn't easy, but the group survives getting out of the city... most of the group anyway. While life isn't easy, it is survivable. They even have some semblance of life in their ramshackle civilization. But they were naive to think they could survive undisturbed. Out in the world are terrors far beyond anything Trina, Mark, and Alec have seen so far, they just didn't think they would be battling those terrors so soon and all at once. Together they hope they can fight through the onslaught, but there are far more dangerous things out there than they expected. And those dangers are around every single corner.<br /><br />The thing to know about this prequel is that it really doesn't ever tell the early story of Thomas and Theresa. This story goes way back to tell how the world got so desperate, and it does a pretty good job of that! The problem here is that as a prequel, some people would choose to start the series here. Earliest chronologically must be the first read, right? Wrong! Don't do it! The Maze Runner is so amazing it, and the two subsequent books, should be read first. If you were to read this prequel first, you would lose the desperation of the world years later as well as find yourself totally lost by the time you get to The Maze Runner.<br /><br />I did think this story was interesting, but it wasn't completely necessary. I would rather have had more of the story of Thomas and Theresa instead of little snippets from the prologue and epilogue, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. It almost seemed like this story should have been its own series that ends with the start of the maze because there is a huge gap between the end of this story and the beginning of the maze. I think this might have been an afterthought from Dashner, but it worked. I would give this prequel to a student who read the rest of the series, but I wouldn't give it to anyone as a stand-alone even though it is so disjointed from the original series. There is, of course, a decent amount of terror and violence, but nothing more so than the original series. Still, I would love to see the gap between the two parts of the series closed with more of the story!ht? Wrong! Don't do it!

B0086213XW|2.0|This movie caught my eye because of the title - which is the title of a Leonard Cohen song - and I'm a Cohen fan.  I wasn't sure what that meant, but I hoped something good.<br /><br />I almost gave up about half-way through the movie - maybe because romantic comedies are not my favorite genre or perhaps because *this* romantic comedy is so blah.  I'm glad I hung in there because I finally discovered that there is a Leonard Cohen connection.  About halfway through, Cohen's song \\"Closing Time\\" (sung by someone other than Cohen) is playing in the background during a party scene.  \\"Take This Waltz\\", sung by Cohen, is featured near the end of the movie.<br /><br />Other than that, there isn't much to recommend this movie.  There is nothing *wrong* with this movie, but there just isn't much to make it memorable.

B009YP9L7U|1.0|Enough said. I kept hoping for some real communication, but never find it in these books. Some good sex play though.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|challenging game to spend some brain time. enjoying it a lot. no need to spend money on it if you don't want to
0762434279|1.0|I have no idea why they would make a book this small.  I was upset when I saw it but also couldn't help but laugh when I saw it.  I thought it was a joke! ... it wasn't.  I haven't read the book yet.  Can't bring myself to take it serous enough in this size and it is too hard to read at that size.  Such a disappointment!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|One of the finest books I have ever read! It is beautifully emotive, gentle and powerful all at the same time.
B000W237RE|5.0|Allman Bros always rock, great album.  Yeah it's old, but it's all good stuff, when the two brothers were both alive & rockin
B001KZG99A|5.0|Great and it came faster then they said this is a great movie I had 2 and 3 so had to buy 1
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is the best game ever you can create any thing you want and there's cheats its the best ever
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The British have done it again.  The history and drama are highly entertaining.  One doesn't need to worry about crass words or details of questionable actions.  The awards for this series is praise enough to watch it each season.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|I wish I would have read some of the reviews a little better BEFORE I bought this book.  I was leaving reviews for a 3 book series I had just finished reading and totally loved - I saw several times \\"if you liked this series then you must read Beautiful Disaster' by J McGuire\\"  I thought - awesome!  Not really!<br /><br />My first complaint are the freakin nicknames.  Pidgeon?  Really?  And then to make it worse and shorten it to Pidge.  Isn't that a nasty, crapping bird?  America shortened to Mare.  Travis shortened to Trav.  and Shepland shortened to Shep.  This has become way too familiar in books so why does the author give someone a perfectly good name like Abby, and then call her Pidgeon?  Enough about this - just turning into a huge turn off for me.<br /><br />I really did not like this book.  Nothing like being attracted to a guy who is a manwhore and beats the crap out of everyone for money and/or looking at his girl wrong.  People who get on here and complain about stories not being real can get on my nerves.  I mean if you want a true story, read a biography right?  But here I go for the first time ever finding myself having to do it.  Who in their right mind hears & sees a bunch of people die in a fire and then decides it's a perfect time to run off and get married?!  Yuck.<br /><br />Save your money folks - the reviews don't tell the truth.  This book is totally awful.
B00BOTCJXC|3.0|I've so enjoyed British films for many years.  This film, however, was a bit more risqué than I thought it would be.  The actors, as usual, are so enjoyable and they make the film believable. I would recommend it to adults.
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|Amazing music that came from Muscle Shoals will amaze you. If you love music from the 60's till the 80's this is a must see.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Big fan of this group anyway...love the lyrics, the artists, the band in general!!! Would definitely recommend this album to friends and family;in fact, I have. To at least three people.
B002M9WW30|5.0|This product was an excellent deal and awesome movie collection!! If you don't have it you do not know what your missing.
B00DNDR29I|4.0|Beautiful voice...great beat...originality galore!  Cindy Mayweather is a great character -- imagination on display.  Can't wait for another album from Janelle.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|loved this movie for years, would recommend it to everyone,it is a very moving story of peoples misguided idea of helping others
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book after recommendation from a friend and just recently decided to read it again.  I recommend this to any person, especially young and interested in Science Fiction to read this novel.  Really looking forward to the movie.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Great start to the new season!  Love Walking Dead, both the show and the graphic novels rock!  Can't wait to see where this season goes!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|This movie did hold my attention for a large portion of the two hours, so I'll give it that. What kept my attention was finding out how they did the tricks and I wanted to know who was organizing the whole thing. The ending was easy and quick. The \\"love story\\" (if you can call it that) was so cheesy I had to turn away. In sum, if you need to keep yourself occupied for two hours, watch this. Otherwise, pass!
B003M2DWE4|4.0|The clock is really nice for a kind who is learning how to tell the time and is also very easy for them to put on/off the alarm
B0042X9L6A|4.0|we ordered this flash for a wedding shoot my daughter was doing that weekend. it arrived when they said, and worked great. (although as an untrained photographer, the instructions were written WAY over my head) but a little web search found a site with instructions written in plain english.
B001F6TXME|4.0|this remote release works very well, though it takes a little getting used to how to push the button to get the autofocus to work and the shutter to release. But once you get the hang of it, it is great.
B004FGMDOQ|2.0|We stopped reading at the part where Miss Peregrine says their kind have only survived in places where organized religion has not &#34;taken hold&#34;.  No thank you!
B00AEBBADG|5.0|I watched this as a when it first came out and now have the dvd thanks for the bring back some good times.
B002M9WW30|5.0|SEEN ALL THE ROCKY FILMS COULDN'T PAST UP A GOOD DEAL  WORTH EVERY PENNY THAT I PAID FOR THIS. !
B00457X8BC|2.0|I like all Kurt Wallender stories, but after the first half of this book I found myself not believing in the story.  I don't find it believable that Wallender snuck back into a formally communist country and brings down the bad guys.  I wouldn't buy this book.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I Love this alarm! I love all of the different sounds you can pick. Some are a little annoying though..
074356619X|5.0|This CD is the doorway to your self,- open it, there is so much more that we have not discovered and this CD can<br />awaken your sleeping soul.<br />Excellent CD I would recommend to all my friends and anyone who would listen.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Brilliant. Doctor Who continues to get better with each season. This show is absolutely brilliant. I find myself watching this show over current primetime television.
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|An excellent set from Thin Lizzy's most commercially successful years.  Hard to compare the re-mastered versions to my crackly old vinyl recordings but, for the most part, they sound excellent and it is just great to hear some of this music again.<br /><br />I was a fan of the band as a wee lad but it wasn't until I went to England in 1980 that I realized how much bigger they were than the Jailbreak LP.  If you haven't plumbed the depths of their catalog you are really missing out.  This set is a really good way to get started but if you like what you hear you'll really want to get Live and Dangerous (one of the best &#34;Live&#34; recordings ever) and go both later (Chinatown in particular) and earlier (&#34;Remembering - Part 1 being a good way to cover a bit of ground) in their careers to get a richer appreciation of this seminal band.<br /><br />One really insignificant note - on the back of the CD cover they list a track on Bad Reputation as &#34;Killer on the Loose&#34; which is actually off Chinatown (I believe it made it to #10 in the UK).  It's actually &#34;Killer without a Cause&#34; -  they do get it right on the back of the individual CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A hero`s journey extremely well written that kept me guessing as to how the author  was going to pull it together.  He did it well and in a manner that wasn't predicted. I have already bought the next in sequence.  Hero`s journey, murder mystery, sci-fi, interaction story, a book that tells a story without the need to assault your senses with distracting metaphors.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I would say that it's pretty good, but the freaking ad for it was awesome!!! Seriously, it's that epic!<br />Get it!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I liked the premise of the book, and was then shattered by the realization that I was reading a modern Americanized pseudo version of Harry Potter, with a mix of everything tweenie. I recognize that tweenie is not a word, but it makes sense in my opinion in my review of this book. I gave it 4 stars because I like paranormal stories, and this one kept my interest, plus I love Harry Potter. I didn't give it 5 because it didn't quite grab my attention long enough for me. Maybe I am too old for this book, as I am way beyond my teens.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is truly amazing . I works fantastically , and notify's u of any stays update , or uploaded photo or video from it friends
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|After listening a couple times through, I loved all the songs.  Adam Lambert has a wonderful voice that conveys the emotions of the songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think I might fail at life if I don't stop playing this game. Taking the temple run gameplay to a whole level, cute characters and loads of cool power ups..a must have.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is a CD that I am very glad to have purchased.  I still like the CD over digital especially if I like most of the songs on the CD, like this one.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|My daughter recommended it.  It is very entertaining action packed drama.  It draws you in to the multi-faceted, fast paced story.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Touching. Heartbreaking. The only movie which caused me to sob in the theaters. It was a must-have for my collection, and I'm not sorry.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Great family movie, with some real funny moments! Our 6 year old little girl really loved it and mom and dad were entertained too! I wish there were more family movies on here.
B00FFHG6KQ|1.0|Game play is horrible!There are no plays of which you can design whether it's defense or offense.Your men usually stand around while the CU picks you apart with behind the back passes or a backdoor play.I want my my money back!That's Amazon for recommending this crap!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy this game! I play my daily bingo's so fast that I can't wait until they are restored. Wish my daily number would increase.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I just have to have my DVD for my collection of the Walking Dead. Truly enjoying my zombies and missed episodes.
B006PZBRCY|5.0|I was quite surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.  It's definitely worth multiple repeat viewings.  I would highly recommend this flick.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|Lots of action never a dual moment,a lots of big boom, will recommend to friends, this one will be part of my collection
B00ER23UYA|5.0|I haven't even listened to this album yet, or even bought it....YET, but I know I'm going to absolutely love it, if Diane's masterpiece debut album wasn't proof enough that she's a true artist! I can't wait to hear Speak A Little Louder. I'm sure it's going to be a pleasurable experience, and I will love to have seen the progression in maturity from her debut to this sophomore album, though if you ask me, she needs no maturing. Why isn't Diane Birch more famous?!?! She's awesome and she's really gorgeous! Little segue backwards to her last album: Rewind is one of the best songs ever!<br />Okay, I will hear this album in its entirety in maybe 10 hours or so, then I will buy it!<br /><br />10 or so hours later : JUST BOUGHT THE DELUXE version! I do have to say that my pre-conceived notion of greatness was right. Diane Birch, you are a genius musician! Thank you so much for sharing your talents with the world.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Protects the kindles while in transit. Very easy to take kindle in and out.  Durable, and the color is pleasing.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|If you haven't seen Broadchurch yet I highly recommend it. Well done and acted, this single murder mystery is spread over 8 episodes and ranks with anything currently in the US. A US version with David Tennant us also coming to the US in the near future.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It has just about all I need. And for free! Just wish it would trend barametric pressure. In fact it would be really cool be able trend any information displayed.
B000NY12CI|4.0|I learned so much from this book and highly recommend it. I would caution people not to get discouraged by the difficult intro by Hitchens and believe it should come at the end rather than beginning.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I started to watch the show because I wanted to know what the hype is all about. Thank God for Amazon. It's like having a good book. You just can't put it down.
B004GJYR7I|5.0|This movie was just fun to watch. Carey Grant is hilarious, especially in a ladies bath robe. Enjoyed every minute
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Inspiring, well written and though provoking. I am so glad I read this book, it made me feel like I belonged to a community and it was great insight into shaping my future. I VERY highly recommend that every woman AND man read this book. It's an easy ready, well researched and cited, and just delightful!! I've already bought it for a few of my friends!
B002ZDOXLW|3.0|i really liked this album. loreena has a mesmorising voice. i only gave it 3 stars because i have another of her cd's which i like even more
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|Firstly,I must say this sounds incredible on vinyl. No surface noise, and not too quiet or loud. According to the NIN website, the vinyl had it's own mix made especially, and after listening to the audiophile mix of the album, Which I downloaded from their site, this sounds similar to that, but adequately mastered for vinyl.The CD mix is great too, but the vinyl really highlights everything in the mix much more. I actually prefer this mix.<br /><br />As with one of his obvious influencers, David Bowie, Trent Reznor is not one to repeat himself artistically. As with Bowie, each album and indeed each track challenges all that you have known about him before. Though at the same time ,the hauntings of all that has been before, musically and lyrically, is never far away.<br /><br />\\" Hesitation Marks\\" is no exception. Although \\" Copy Of A\\" and \\" Came Back Haunted\\" exemplify the NIN we have come to know with a familiar sound, and brilliantly I might add, there is yet more to come to challenge that very familiarity.<br /><br />\\" Find My Way\\" is a dark and eerie introspective track that follows and is beautifully brooding and haunting. Definitely three strong opening tracks.<br /><br />\\"All Time Low\\" is interesting, as is \\" Disappointed\\" which uses some new and interesting instrumentation, that have the trademark Reznor distortion added to make them sound unique.<br /><br />There has been much controversy over \\" Everything\\", which I must say when I first heard it was quite taken back by it's uplifting style, not a side of Reznor I'd seen before. I must confess though, with it's almost pop sound at times, is refreshingly challenging as I've spoken of, and is interestingly catchy.<br /><br />\\"Satellite\\" , once again when I first heard it, did not resonate with my ears, sounding like a Hip Hop misadventure, beat wise especially. Upon further listens though I don't mind it so much.<br /><br />\\" Various Methods Of Escape\\" is again quite trademark traditional Nine Inch Nails, both in sound and lyric. Once again a more introspective view potentially of Reznor's own demons, as is common place amongst all his work.<br /><br />\\" Running\\" I haven't really got my head around yet and after all my listens, find it quite weak and almost irrelevant in context.<br /><br />\\" I Would For You\\" reminds me of Year Zero's \\" In This Twilight\\" in terms of sound, and is as strong and emotive.<br /><br />\\" In Two\\" and \\" While I'm Still Here\\" are also solid although the horns at the end of the latter track are somewhat unnecessary and corny sounding I must say.<br /><br />Some may say that after 5 years, this is not the NIN that once was, and it isn't!!<br /><br />The aesthetics of this album are resting in \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" to draw comparison in terms of being more electronic than industrial.<br />There is however remnants of everything that he has done before there also, but then also new directions.<br /><br />On first listen, this album was somewhat pulverizing and challenged all I'd known from Reznor. Then I remembered that most all that he's released to date has gone in so many different directions musically on any one album. And that has also been the very thing that has drawn me to his work.<br /><br />I think \\"Hesitation Marks\\" stands perfectly beside all Reznor's work and is as interesting and challenging as all that has been before it. Brilliant.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Erotic fiction, a good read (just make sure you're alone!) Well written. I would very much recommend this book. Can't wait to start on the next ones.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a nice app to have if you use Pinterest I am not a huge user of the app but it is nice to have at my fingertips if I ever need it.
B006Z00R1Q|4.0|Good movie, a bit predictable but good! There are some good scares, but I always preferred to watch this movie with other people.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I have had this mouse for 6 months, and there isn't a single thing that I hate about this mouse. It is well worth the price, and it is a good mouse for starting gamers, and pros.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I Could not put it down. I absolutely loved this series and it was not what I expected at all.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you are doing a good choise this is awsome u get updates. you run from a foolish security gaurd.get different characters.cool huh.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was very disappointed with this streaming media player.  It only works on a single band router, and not a dual band one.  After I spent an hour with technical support they discovered that I had to change my router to a single band one. This fact IS NOT indicated in the specifications.  Total waste of money and time.
B00DVPN30A|5.0|I can't understand the reviewers who want it to be just like his former tracks/albums. How boring would that be and truth be told it's all VERY Amos Lee. As a longtime A.L. follower I have to say I really love the whole album. Once through really isn't enough as another reviewer mentioned, find a peaceful spot and get those headphones on. By the 3rd time through you'll feel the depth of where it takes you.<br /><br />We get to see him live this Sunday night so I've done my homework and will be in the front singing along to my hearts content. Fair warning to everybody nearby ;)
0679805273|5.0|I love this book! I bought it to read to my daughter. It is so inspirational and truly a fun read! The illustrations are fun to look at too!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really liked this game - I played until finished, I couldn't stop! gard enough to feel challenging but not so hard that you give up.  love the hints and mostly used them to confirm my thoughts. I really liked the combo of hidden object, missions and the story were great. I didn't mind paying for the full game but agree with other reviewers, it should state that. def worth the money but I lost a whole day cause I couldn't put it down!
B0001GL3K4|5.0|My husband introduced me to this movie. It's the only &#34;girlie&#34;/romantic movie that he can stand. It is one of our favorites - highly recommend to anyone who wants a heartwarming movie!
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well written and argued.<br />I have no way of verifying the author's view but it was exciting to read someone's research on this important topic
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Classic movies in blu-ray. What is not to like. Aliens in HD! Awesome! If you loved it on dvd then what are you waiting for?
B000002TLX|4.0|The timing was perfect. It was delivered in time for me to listen to his songs before I went to his concert.<br />The list of music on this CD, covers most of his best hits and the songs I best remember of him.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|It is a great album, but sort of a rehash of Bobby Brown from the 80's. I love it though. It really beats the carp out of a lot of the other new music. I guess it is no mistake that I was drawn to this music like I had heard it before. Still I love it!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you are a fan of Stephen then you have read the Shining and you will really enjoy this book. If you have not read the shining it's important you do before reading Doctor Sleep.<br />This is one of his best books recently. I enjoy all of his works, but this I think will become another on of his classics.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I normally don't like to give books five stars. Usually there's something that I don't like but this book blew me away. Early on, I was hooked and read the whole book in a couple hours. It's not a book you typically come across and I can honestly say I was impressed. The author does a great job at making you fall in love with all the characters and really feel like you know them. Overall, I feel it's a must read. I have already told all my friends that read to get it; I know they won't be disappointed!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great puzzle game!  the rooms were challenging enough yet doable.  there were enough simple things to do to keep you trying to figure it out without causing frustration.  definitely would recommend this game
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Simply the best guide to handle your life!Wish I had it when I was a little girl, but better late than never!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book, and by extension the series, is the best for anyone who likes psychological drama with lots of action.  I've read this book multiple times and each time find something I missed before.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I waited a long time to get this book because it was hyped in all the magazines and online. It took me quite a while to get into it.  Slow beginning.  Then in the middle it picked up speed and so did I.  But I have to say I was quite disappointed in the ending.
0060899220|4.0|Great inside look at the restaurant business, and I mean business, from the kitchen.  Bourdain al though a mad hatter in the 1980s sure has a story to tell.  And he tells it with wit, charm and honesty.  He can be acerbic and a bit pompous but all is forgiven as one gets to know the &#34;Chef.&#34;  He is a man who has been down and has been up.  Seems he likes up much better.  Intelligent and street smart are two things Anthony has in large supply.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Greatest movie I have seen in a long time. Probably one of my top 5. The actors are amazing and I never stopped laughing.
B00EDR5N58|4.0|For 50 bucks, I certainly was surprised when I got it today. I thought it would be a cheapo Vinyl Case and everything on the side. I did not expect a huge case! If you like the music, it is worth the money. The sound quality is superb compared to other records I have bought new recently. It looks nice on my shelf with my other records, and is certainly worth the money.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|While these shows cannot be expected to be at the level of today's special effects, they are in many ways<br />far better than the new Star Trek movies.  Great actors, campy but often leading edge stories, and a level<br />of sincerity that we just don't seem to have today.  Thanks for having them on!
B00CHVJODE|5.0|This was one of the funniest and heart warming movies I have ever seen. The whole family loved it! Great!
B001IF277K|5.0|This battery is an original Sony Ericsson. It is good and serves its purpose. Last long time for all day cellphone usage.
B00DQVST76|1.0|I loaded the MDNA Tour today only to find the picture to be scrambled like a bad satellite picture. The sound was great but what good is that if you can't see a picture. And of course, as luck would have it, my warranty from Amazon ran out yesterday so I guess that's 20 bucks down the drain. Very disappointed, especially since this is obviously a worldwide problem according to other reviews. You would think that Amazon and other places would exchange them or at the very least, keep everyone updated about when a new DVD is released and offer to exchange for free. Like I said, very disappointed as a fan and as a Amazon.com customer.
B008Y212PI|4.0|An interesting game; quite challenging.<br /><br />Wherever you go, there you are.<br /><br />In space, no one can hear you scream.<br /><br />Loyalty.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|You gotta love these Minions. It's a simple, clever game with great graphics. The many interfaces (I'm not a fan of them) can be a little confusing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved everything about this book.  Suzanne Collins is a gifted author with the ability to paint pictures with words. A must read!
1401223176|5.0|This was the first Batman story I've read (besides the titles with Justice League, Birds of Prey, and Superman/Batman), and I thought it was great. Combining a pretty good mystery (even if you think you have it figured out, there will be a little more to the story), and incredible artwork by Jim Lee. His detail is amazing. We're lucky that there are so many characters in the story that we get to see drawn by Jim Lee.
0345803507|5.0|This product is for adults only.  The shipping time and price were excellent.  The book is best desribed as a soft porn.
B00421IR5I|5.0|I bought this for my French 1 students to watch, and it's one of their favorites!  Totally school appropriate, and absolutely hilarious!
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|Really good listening... sweet melodies, immersing atmosphere and enticing rhythm from a new artist that pushes the acoustic music towards the electric.
B001R0LOES|5.0|Good history lesson on  what the Irish went through to gain independence. I recommend it highly.  Liam Nelson is good in his role.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I'm a fan so this was always gonna be on my radar,Being in Ireland can't play the dvd but the bluray<br />won't be a problem.But that's not why i bought it,As I said I'm a fan and any trek stuff I'm gonna buy
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|A good story is woven through the nuclear history of the world. I didn't recognize the author's name until after I'd bought the book, she reminded me that he also wrote Fast Food Nation.<br /><br />Some scary moments. A very good quick read.
B00FB6FOEU|5.0|Joan Jett has proved by all the tunes here that she still has the heart and the talent to keep playing and making great music. After all these years (since 1976, if I'm not mistaking ),she proves that indeed &#34;Rock and Roll Never Forgets&#34; ! Even more to her credit, she has some fine ballads here that are very heartfelt, yet in no way sappy. Hey Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.. how much more talent, likability and versatility do you need ?
B000001DU5|5.0|For those who love the hits from the 80s, this CD won't disappoint. A compilation of the classic sound of Tears for Fears, you'll love every single tune.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|I had seen Once when it first came out.  I just went to see the musical, Once.  So I decided to buy the DVD so that I can watch it over and over again.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Best show on television - witty dialogue, great chemistry between all of the cast, beautifully filmed - what's not to like?
B001AQO3QA|3.0|The case for all of the movies looks like a book which is neat but the movies all ended up with a sticky substance on them from the cardboard sleeve that made the movie skip.  I have tried to clean them but it is difficult without scratching them.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Must read for anyone that wants to know what it was really like for a ground pounder (soldier) at the end of WWII. A side you never hear much about - what it was like to be an American POW. War is hell isn't just a quote, it true, Kurt Vonnegut was there and tells it in a that only he possessed.<br />Ever heard of Dresden? I hadn't; Google it and then read this book...
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I enjoyed picking up this game here and there.  It was a challenging experience and felt very satisfied once I got my 10000000 score.
B0026145WK|5.0|A dad being what a dad should be in this movie.  Doing everything he could to protect his daughter.  Liam Neeson plays the part incredibly well.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This is only my second Jack Reacher novel and I'm hooked!  What a great read.  Very hard to put down.
B00ANAC32U|3.0|I'm glad it costs half as much on Amazon than Google Play charges. However, the plastic at the bottom (near the USB slot) is not very sturdy. Don't expect to get more than a couple of month out of this.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love love love this app. I have difficulty sleeping through the night, but if I wake up and have one of the relaxed melodies playing I can get right back to sleep. Highly recommend river and frogs combo!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed this book it still had twists and turns and it left me wanting more. I'm glad there will be the next book captivated by you!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app but it need more like enderman, village, tracks, rain, etc. Some ppl can't afford computers and love mine craft but can't download it. Personally I would pay more for a update to this minecraft. To be just like the computer. Thank you :)
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|It's OK Not really into writing reviews on these things. I think it is a poor decision for Amazon to force it.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|As funny as the previous Angry Birds Star Wars. I've been playing non-stop the whole weekend. If you enjoy Angry Birds, you want this game.
B00FHAB3HW|1.0|Still can't give 0 stars on Amazon? This album will represent how much of a bandwagon people are willing to ride. This album is the opposite of creativity and originality. If you want new music, listen to Lorde. Lorde (using her because she is new and a perfect example of music evolution) is fresh squeezed orange juice; Miley Cyrus is Sunny D. Lorde's music wakes you up in the morning and stimulates brain activity; \\"Bangerz,\\" with a z, gives you a sugar rush and a headache, leaving you asking yourself why you ever drank it. Miley is a fake representation of a healthy, delightful substance; she is that gritty feeling left on your teeth. This album is a leaky bag of trash - quick throw it in the dumpster before it drips all over everything!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Over all I love this game,also check out the computer and Xbox version.I think you should add  more stuff such as redstone property's,villages and already made mineshafts like in the Xbox.thanks.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Very good book. I enjoyed reading very much and only wish it had been written when I was younger. It does however, still gives me plenty of insight and opportunities for growth and sharing.
B000HL09MG|4.0|maybe the script or lack thereof is sposed to drive one to distraction so that u miss so many complex elements and hence drive you to watch this bizarro circus world over and over just like a line in the script....  I basically enjoy the script driven film and don't appreciate short circuited symbolism and work it out in my head like a Led Zep album cover...  entertaining but u expected it, not here...  guess after 3 viewings looking for those imperceptible concepts found 1 profound and 1 maybe...  FIRST: when wifey is recanting her 'weird' dream sitting up u get a very quick shot of Cruise laying on his bak in shadow with only his eyes lit up like a christmas tree and first u think wow he is looking up but a nanosecond later u comprehend this lighting is no accident as his eyes are wide...open? NO! SHUT! so that brings me to the maybe, a parenthetical interjection of punctuation: Eyes Wide( 2 missisippis....OPEN? whoa)SHUT!!  ye ol switchero? my best guess to date and all the other nonsense is of lil import, mostly annoying artiface but sets interior/exterior were abs stunning! recommend to watch just to help me figure this bastard's motivations, stanley that is.... GOOD LUCK!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is unique and different in many ways I found it very challenging .to me this is a great game and is also like a brain teaser !!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Anyone who loves Stephen King and wondered what happened to the little boy must read this! I couldn't put the book down and finished it, sadly, in two days. The author was right- I may never look at the RV community quite the same...
B00881VLCE|5.0|I just downloaded it today &amp; I love it. I enjoy doing puzzles. It's very relaxing when I'm doing them. I will recommended to family &amp; friends.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Love the history and the importance of keeping music real and not digitaly enhanced.  This movie shows how music should be created and recorded.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|It was a really great movie I'd watch again. If you haven't seen it you should  go check it out.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I knew the love languages existed, but until my dr recommended this book, I didn't realize that this might be our problem. My husband is reading it now and I hope to improve our relationship tremendously by making more of an effort to communicate in his language and not mine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that minecraft pocket edition is great. It may be behind Xbox and pc by a long way but it is getting closer with every new update
