B003NQ9LHQ|5.0|Classics are a classic for a reason. I purchased this second copy to catch anything thrown in for the anniversary. Also, because I wanted a second copy for my house at the beach.<br /><br />It's worth the money to make sure it isn't left behind. I depend on it because I care about my craft.
0470449756|5.0|i like it very much, this is a very good one that i chose . and I will let my friends know
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|While I didn't think this one ranked up with the Avatars of the world, it was a very well made, enjoyable movie.  Jennifer Lawrence was very believable in this role, and while the premise is a bit far fetched (sending 12 year old children to their death for entertainment), if you can look past this, the movie was overall a solid one all around.  I don't want to give anything away so I won't go into any more detail, but I am looking forward to the next one in the series.

B005E9SMPC|5.0|Intriguing, inspiring,  extremely well written. This book will challenge the way you think about the world. AND, the plot is juicy.

B000AQJPQE|5.0|Simple to assemble!<br />Easy to install and use!<br />Fun for my 3 year old to play with.  Ask questions, give answers and feed the curiosity about planets, the space etc!<br />Is his surprise for everyone that comes to the house and he loves to explain it!<br />A smart-learning-toy-tool!!! What else would you expect!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I received for Christmas a Kindle Fire HD , this alarm clock application was one of the first applications that I installed on it. It's now almost the end of April and I haven't as of yet encounter any of the problems that I have read about. I have had this application running continuously from the time I installed it. Besides the advertisement running, I have no complaints about this free alarm clock application.
B0091REZMW|1.0|The game has a fairly interesting story line, you're investigating a mansion where unexplained phenomena happen all the time. Here's where the game sucks:  awefully repetitive.  You have to keep exploring the same rooms over and over until you level up, and then you get one more room to explore over and over until you level up.  The hidden objects do move but once you've been to the room 3 or 4 times you know where to look, and believe me, you will be in the room at least 3 or 4 times as you try to level up.  There are shortcuts and this is where the game goes into hypersuck mode:  you can buy tools or level ups with diamonds, but you only seem to get 5 diamonds on every level-up.  There's probably ways if you play on-line with a community, but I'd rather just go through the game with-out the &#34;on-line&#34; community.  You can buy diamonds, but that becomes a rather expensive proposition.  I don't feel like dropping $60 a week on this game so I can get through it.  Pretty much gonna delete it, and that's that.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|These are great and would recommend this product to anyone. They are easy to handle and easy to clean. I am even fixing to purchase some more of his stuff.  I had never heard of him but has great products.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Let me be clear.  I do not like heart warming movies and I am not a fan of French culture.  Ignoring both tendencies, I rented \\"Intouchables\\" and I am SO glad I did.  This is an amazing movie that engages you from it's first frame, holds you to the end and leaves you wanting more.  What is particularly remarkable is the fact that it is based on a true story.  I'm not going to give you the story here.  You can go to IMDB for that.  What I am going to suggest is that you give this film a try.  You will be rewarded with a good story, good acting, good production values and a warmth that will literally leave you laughing and crying simultaneously.  You will quickly understand why this was the second most successful French film of all time.  GIVE IT A TRY.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Well I bought this because he is from my home town, but also because he really is a very talented singer/songwriter.  I have enjoyed listening to his music and can't wait for what's to come next.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Many aspects of the show were quite weird/Sci-fi. Definitely it's outside the box kind of writing. The characters are unique and interesting. The show drew me in enough in the first couple episodes to make me a follower.<br />If you like scifi weirdness, you will like this show.
B0016PM722|4.0|I have purchased two of these FX lightsabers.  I kept one and gave one to my oldest nephew (13) for Christmas one year.  It's always a fan favorite among the kids, especially at night or in a dark room.<br /><br />Cons: It is very heavy and the handle is big around, so it is hard for children under the age of 5 to handle it.  I know it is not made for them, but they all want to play with it anyway.
0765365278|5.0|This is a great book, but very long. It consists of three arcs, two of which will obviously coalesce by the end of the book. The third arc is not necessary for this book and only becomes relevant at the very end. It could have been left out and the size of the book could have been reduced. On the other hand, the arc is interesting and is worth reading. The characters were well developed and the action scenes are excellent. I recommend this book for anyone who likes the fantasy genre. This book will be particularly interesting for fans of the Malazan series as in certain respects the books are similar. The complete series is ten books so start now and you can be finished in time for the second book when it comes out in November 2013.
B005LF9IO8|2.0|the movie was slow in the middle, action good, but story lacking.  Needed more storyline to explain the history of the situation.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|This show is as exciting as Breaking Bad. It's definitely one to see. Just a warning to casual viewers, this show is addictive!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|We saw this movie at the theater and liked it so much that we wanted our own copy of the movie.  Anyone who has read the trilogy books with these same characters should love this first movie of the triology.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not only do I enjoy this game but my toddler does too. Especially petting him and getting him to run around the paddock.
B0094K1K42|2.0|I was looking forward to seeing the movie for a long time. Love Diablo Cody and Charlize Theron. But the movie seemed a little too boring for me. Maybe I'll watch it again, must have missed the good parts.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I happend to catch Oblivion last weekend in an IMAX theater - which I would recommend. The movie, in my opinion, was very good. The music...wow. It's reminiscent of Tron: Legacy, but on a much grander scale. Also makes me think of Rise of the Planet of the Apes. It's haunting, ethereal at times. If you are a soundtrack buff like me, this is a must have.<br /><br />It makes SO much more sense once you see the film, but stands on its own. DEFINITELY worth $7.00 via Amazon mp3 download. MUCH cheaper than iTunes.
1451695195|5.0|I read a loaned copy of  Proof of Heaven also saw a  You Tube interview of Dr Eben Alexanders N.D. E and would like to reread his story. And to have a copy to loan out to those who wouln not other wise  be aware of  such a detailed experienc with  a scientific explanation<br />Yhank you L.S.
B00005JMCW|5.0|Enjoyed movie with much laughter and watching how all characters were always searching for ways to plan ways to get their  goals met
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it, Loved It, Loved it!!!!!!!!! This is truely a love story between TWO people, a virgin and a pro!!!
B0000BWTK3|4.0|I bought this CD for the Grieg concerto, and can't imagine a better digital recording of it. Five stars for the Grieg, maybe four for the Schumann...I didn't find Andsnes playing as inspired...maybe that's because it isn't as enjoyable a concerto...buy it for the Grieg, which you will regularly listen to...
B000002L5I|4.0|This is the 3rd cd that i have reviewed by KWS and like his &#34;LEADBETTER HEIGHTS&#34; and &#34;LIVE IN CHICAGO&#34; this one is also a very solid effort. My favorite tracks are &#34;BLUE ON BLACK&#34; , LONG GONE and &#34;EVERYTHING IS BROKEN&#34;. I hope KWS doesn't change his style because he knows what blues rock is all about as demonstrated on the cd's I have purchased from Amazon. Buy it knowing that you are getting the real thing.<br /><br />John Walsh
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Fun and addictive I play it all the time.I always buy mystery box's for the chance of winning the jackpot.great game make some better updates that would be nice. I give it 4*s.
B0031RS4UM|4.0|Most Entertaining<br />It was difficult to put down, it was fast moving and very enjoyable, a typical Lee Child book<br />Highly recommended
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Great movie! One you can watch over and over. Will most likely purchase this, since I only rented it. Loved it!
B00AQLGXTU|2.0|I was so dissapointed with this book. I adored the first one. The idea was great and exactly the kind of thing I love to read about so I was extremely excited to read the second book in the series.<br />I just finished and am left completely..bored and unimpressed. There was absolutely no character or plot development. The second book ends and we know nothing more about each character than we did when the first book ended. I would say we dont know where the story is headed either but that would be a lie.<br />The big defining moment I think was supposed to be when American gave her idea on her philanthropic projects. It's supposed to be shocking with unbelievable results but it's not either of those things. It feels like while the character was struggling for ideas so was the author and wrote about the completely obvious stuff while not even planning it out properly.<br />Also im having a hard time believing the most powerful country in the world cant protect it's most powerful family from poorly planned attacks at their home until the people are right at the door. Are we suppoaed to believe they dont have access to the materials they need to build a fence?<br />Why are the elite so uninterested in WHY the rebels are continually attacking then? Why do the rebels only attack when it threatens to get boring? It feels like theyre thrown in there at random for no reason.<br />Why is America over looking Maxons trysts with other women? Why is Aspen sitting around while she dates another man waiting for her when they could both be killed for secretly dating?<br />How did Americas character go from strong and funny and willful to boring and placid amd just plain idiotic at times?<br />I had such high hopes for this second book which could have been excellent and I think that makes it doubly disssapointing. I hope the author takes the time to think the third book out properly and thoroughly and puts together something as interesting as the first book was.
B003UYUP6M|5.0|I have used Google for a very long time. I have come across various articles in magazines talking about the &#34;Googleplex&#34; and how the company operates. Everyone knows about how data focused they are and the 20% time, but I wanted to learn more. This book definitely delivers on that.<br /><br />Levy breaks down each part of Google into seven parts and explores each part to a fascinating detail. He talks with multiple workers at Google and quotes them when talking about something the worker was involved in. It makes it very interesting because the words are coming straight from the worker, rather than Levy.<br /><br />As far as bias goes, Levy is a pretty transparent author. He just records things as they are. While it is true he seemed &#34;awed&#34; by what the company has accomplished, he never tried to hide away any of the &#34;evil&#34; parts of Google that has led to controversy. He talks a lot about privacy issues and how a few of Google's products flopped because of this issue (like Buzz).<br /><br />I think this book did a great job focusing on one of the greatest companies in recent years, I just wish more people would read it to see that Google isn't as evil as the media/people make it out to be.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It was  the first john green book I've read but it certainly won't be the last :)
B0087EVHVW|5.0|It may not be the fastest processor out there, but it certainly is a great bang for your buck. At less than $200, this processor blows all the other options out of the water in terms of benchmark.  Low power-draw, easily overclocked with a good MoBo, and outperforms others in its class? Sign me up!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|It does everything I wanted it to do plus extras.  Everything works great.  I recommend this to any one that prints on the go,and uses it at home . Great product.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use,basic machine.  Good for everyone. It is a handy addition to any tablet.you will not regret this add on.
B00881PTRC|3.0|The color choice for some of the letters make them hard to see.  Also the dark blue selection bar obliterated the subject choice.  Cute idea but have no idea what the words were when I got them wrong because the letters were in yellow against the yellowish background.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a wonderful show! It is very gripping and addictive. It is wonderful to see it on AMAZON instant video!
B000FBJAOG|4.0|You can't agree with some of the opinions, but you can't argue with some of the fact either.  Fun read, especially the historical evidence.  I feel more prepared than 3 days ago.  :)
B00003CXIP|5.0|Take a great Stephen King story, then have the brilliance to hire into the four main roles young boys who will all become names in the movie and television industry and you can't loose.  You will watch this movie more than once, even if you saw it when it first was released.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|This show is utterly fantastic. A deeply layered, blisteringly intense, constant adrenaline rush of a show with some of the strongest storytelling on television.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book was a little confusing at first. But, once i got into it I was hooked. You need to give it a chance you won't be sorry
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Super fun and entertaining, yet not too complicated. The best house game I have ever played on kindle or android or Apple.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I have to admit that the first section was tough for me to get through. I had a hard time adjusting to the narrative of a 5-year old. A friend told me to stick with and I'm so glad I did! This book is so unique and dangerously engrossing. (I nearly missed my subway stop on more than one occasion!) It definitely left me wanting more!
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Great insight in to the abusive cycle.  The reader can feel the intensity.  Even when you are physically able to escape it, emotionally there is always a connection.
B000FA675C|5.0|How can you not like this one.  It has everything a great book should have.  I have already read this multiple times, but thought since it was free on amazon I would put it on my kindle so I can read whenever I wanted.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Really good story.  Wasn't what I expected at all.  There was lots of twists and turns throughtout the whole book.  I do think that the main characters might have been just a little bit young for all of this to happen to then, but that is just my opinion.  I will be rereading this book again in the future.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|This book is not what I'd call a page-turner.  However, there is a lot to be found here that is worth the slog.  Each of the characters are unique unto themselves, and have very different thoughts and opinions -- to a degree where even the writing style changes to reflect the ways the characters think. It will  take a while before the plot actually reveals itself, and when it does, it's almost cute in how cliche it is.  The book seems to read as  a case study on how to revitalize a tired genre.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The original version was great!  The new version just introduced sucks!  I'm going to delete it.  It's clumbersome and difficult to navigate.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this game & plays it all the time. I like it because it allows him to be creative by building & creating things. The other great thing about this game is that you can join another player. My son & I will play together on our kindles.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|While it's rather dark for watching on a laptop or Kindle Fire, the content makes it worth any eyestrain. Daniel Day-Lewis is a truly superb Lincoln. Sally Fields was perfectly cast as Mary Todd Lincoln. I'll be viewing this one again on a larger screen.
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I love the book and I had this movie on VHS. A great Danny Kaye classic so I bought the DVD to update my copy.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|I can't imagine why the book was so long.  It was very good and interesting in the beginning, but after about 300 pages I was tired of it.  Too bad!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is a book I would recommend to any young science fiction fan.  What it lacked in literary perfection it more than made up in being a good story.  Timely Mars science was well represented.  As an &#34;over the hill&#34; retired Mechanical Engineer myself I identified with the need to solve problems one at a time.  I hope this book inspires more &#34;old school&#34; science fiction that tells a good tale wrapped in science without all of the moral teeth gnashing and judgmental crap that has defined the genre for the last few decades.
B0013F1D02|1.0|This movie had a lot of potential but failed to deliver.  I tried to like it, but I fell asleep.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|If you ever wondered what life would be like if you were left on Mars, this book is for you.  It is pretty raw, lots of vulgar language, but it is appropriate.  I love that it has real science in it, and it help you understand the &#34;why&#34; in the thought process.  Most Sci-Fi books miss the mark on this and make stuff up (Like Trekee jargon).  This book actually has some thought and scientific rationale  to it.  I like that the characters are more &#34;real&#34; and more &#34;human&#34; than most Sci-Fi books.  Overall, this is a good read and is predictable, but good for short &#34;out of this world&#34; entertainment rather than &#34;Reality&#34; TV shows.
B000FA675C|5.0|fast paced, good characters and a very good story blends all the different mytho;ogies together . really did enjoye it
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've seen an American film at this level of quality.  In some ways, it's reminiscent of the Western-themed premium TV shows, \\"Deadwood\\" and \\"Hell on Wheels.\\"  So you can expect a lot of violence.  On the other hand, the acting is exemplary and convincing. The atmosphere is simultaneously ominous and hilarious.  Beautiful landscape, scenery and music contribute to a superlative movie.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Wonderful album!! So many great songs!! I would highly recommend this album for any Depeche Mode fan! This is probably in my top 5 favorite of all 13 albums.
B004KKYX9K|5.0|I Love Jodi Picoult's books. As usual this book takes unexpected turns and explores our reactions to these circumstances. I expected the book to be more about IVF. Hadn't really considered what happens to frozen embryos.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My 4 year old has played the Dr. Panda series for a while and enjoys every one. Keep them coming!
B0091QS88K|5.0|My 4 year old has played the Dr. Panda series for a while and enjoys every one. Keep them coming!

B00B9JDBT8|5.0|While I enjoy living in jungle habitats and feasting on the flesh of careless travelers, I often find there to be something missing. Fortunately, my friend across the swamp was able to help remedy my situation. He found that while listening to this album, the primal instinctiveness flowed easier and with more fluidity.<br /><br />The first track brings to mind the lovely start of a jungle journey. Maybe the sight seer is there on vacation. Maybe she's there to do a study on the local wildlife or plants. OR maybe he's running from civilization. No matter.<br /><br />When the second track goes into play, nothing matters anymore. It's time for the slaughter. The blood. The gore. The sweat. The screams. Ah! I'm just so Full of Fire that a Tooth for an Eye wont cut it. No. I need the Cherry on Top.<br /><br />But enough about me. Because, as you know by now, Without You My Life Would Be Boring.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This second season was basically a set up for the third season, for those of us who read the books.<br />For you non readers the second season left a lot of things unfinished and unsaid.  I watched mine<br />as a memory jogger before the 3rd season begins.<br /><br />Any doubts about getting this, don't be afraid, it only gets better.
B005IKZ1B0|5.0|Love Titanium especially. First heard snips of it from the movie Pitch Perfect. So then I found and listened to the rest of the album and the arrangements sound great.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|The writing is astonishing - poetic, inventive, complex, with incredible variations in style. I'm reading it slowly because I just don't want it to end.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Ridley Scott seems to be setting up a storyline that connects Blade Runner to Prometheus to Alien. Promotional materials released in England at the time of the London premiere of Prometheus included a screen capture of a statement written by Peter Weyland. A statement in which he discusses his professional relationship with Eldon Tyrell and the Tyrell Corporation. Weyland broke with Eldon Tyrell when he realized that Tyrell wanted to create Replicants for the purpose of various forms of slave labor. Peter Weyland believed that Replicants had a \\"higher purpose\\". So the Weyland Corporation began creating their own line of Replicants. Ash, Bishop and David are Replicants, but for a very prosaic reason they're not referred to as Replicants. Why? Because the term Replicant, as applied to androids, is co-owned by the estate of Philip K. Dick and Warner Brothers. And the Alien movies are owned 20th Century Fox, and licensing-the-use-rights-fees would have to be paid...<br /><br />I've been told that much of this Peter Weyland/Eldon Tyrell backstory is told in the Special Features of the Blu-ray and the Blu-ray/3D editions of Prometheus. So...order those editions from Amazon, if you want to learn more about the Weyland/Tyrell connection. The online ordering information is available through a link on this page. Amazon's computers are waiting to take your call...<br /><br />I suspect that David is a Nexus 8, who's been given a voice similar to the voice given to the Hal 9000 mainframe computer, that went online at the IBM laboratory in Urbana, ILL, in the 1990's. The Hal 9000 was installed in the spaceship Discovery, for its mission to Jupiter, in the early years of the 21st century. The history of that space mission is highly classified. Top Secret. Not even accessible to those with the highest security clearance. NASA has put those files deep into cold storage...metaphorically speaking. Something about cultural shock and disorientation, should those files go public...<br /><br />However, footage related to that expedition IS available from Amazon! Just enter...2001: A Space Odyssey...<br /><br />Footnote: Rumor has it that Ridley Scott wants to make a sequel to Blade Runner. Rumor also has it that Harrison Ford wants to play Rick Deckard again. Which would necessitate setting the story approximately 30 years after the first film...around 2050. But I emphasize, these are just rumors at this time, unless someone out there in Amazon Land knows more than I do.<br /><br />Sir Ridley has also said he intends to make a sequel to Prometheus. The story of David and Elizabeth Shaw's journey to the home planet of the Engineers. And Dr. Shaw's confrontation with the Engineers, asking them why they created human kind and then wanted to destroy human kind, with that bio-weapon of mass destruction...the Alien, which seemed to have bitten the hand that created it...so to speak. So, perhaps both films will be coming soon to a multiplex near you. And subsequently available in Blu-ray, 3D and DVD from Amazon. Stay tuned!
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is a great addition to the Bond franchise and a worthy entry for the 50th anniversary.  A compelling villain, albeit another agent gone bad (a la Goldeneye), but with a more personal agenda.  Some of the old fun of Bond is starting to creep back in at last, rather than just relying on fighting and chasing.  There's plenty of that but Mendes was able to provide visually compelling scenes.  I was surprised to find that the movie became part 3 of what has turned out to be a trilogy of rebooting the Bond franchise.  Casino Royale showed us Bond at the beginning of his career, just promoted to 00 status.  Quantum of Solace concluded that story.  I thought we'd be moving along.  Turns out, we were in for one more to re-establish the Bond universe.  Within the context of the story, it was done well.  I'm glad it wasn't the main theme.  I'm not sure how I feel about the ending, because it feels like Silva won and the entire point of the movie and protagonists was defeated.  But what I appreciate is that it elicited an emotional reaction, so it was done well.
0060936223|4.0|Tho' I admittedly have only an in passing knowledge of both Patti Smith & Robert Mapplethorpe I picked this up as I do have a rather intense interest in the 70's punk music scene.<br /><br />This book had very little to do with the music itself but that wound up being just fine by me. Instead I found myself involved in a very moving and respectful memoir of a friendship that I don't think many of us will experince. Most certainly not now in this digital age. As theirs was a partnership to create art which requires intimacy.<br /><br />What I found utterly fascinating was Patti Smith's true love affair which was not Robert but in fact was with books. Having read Rimbaud and some of the other classic writers who inspired her to take the trail she did and being moved to devour nearly everything that is in pages myself, I admit I felt an instant kinship with Patti. I could even see what I believe Robert's true place and point of interest in her life was, which was that of the etheric muse. Rather than a physically passionate experience Robert was the come-to-life romantic archtype sprung from many a poet/novelist imagination. His wild and often self-destructive experimentations allowed her to observe and absorb the results without having to partake of the resulting damages (most of the time) herself. He was encouraging and yet more importantly influential and inspiring in molding who Patti Smith would ultimately become.<br /><br />I really felt that this was a tribute to how a friend and companion can irretrievably affect or create us. In this case, despite the ups and crashing downs these two were in it truly for the better and the worst and ultimately that kind of loyalty was what pervaded their relationship and I found that to be much greater than their art.
0345803493|3.0|Ok - I have quite a bit to say about this second book, so bear with me.  I have never been a huge reader (there I said it)  but these books are really really addicting.  I don't know why, or how, because of my review below - but I can't put these books down.  I have read the first 2 in a week - still have the last one to read!<br /><br />  We last left Ana and Christian in book 1 when he beat her with the belt in the \\"Red Room of Pain\\" and she was so traumatized she left him.  So the second book opens, she's started her new job, devasted and just miserable without Christian.  She survives 5 whole days without him (and without eating/sleeping) then of course, he contacts her.  Does this woman have a backbone, I mean really?  She gives into his email, responds and it's game on AGAIN.  They talk and HE TRIES TO BLAME HER FOR BEATING HER!!!  He says it was her fault for letting it get out of hand because she didn't use the \\"safe-word\\".  Seriously, this guy wins D-bag of the year award - but it only gets better with his atrocious behavior as the book goes on.  Well, he agrees to do the whole \\"vanilla sex\\", no contract thing and soon he falls head over heels in love with her, though he has a hard time saying it to her.  We all know how she feels about him.  She goes to a glamours dinner/ball Christian's family throws for a charity and everyone is so happy he's happy and so on.  Deep down, I really wanted to believe this was a beautiful love story, that she changed his bad boy ways, but I just can't forget the ending chapter from book 1. His constant sayings \\"I want to spank the **** out of you\\" - this guy is just an abusive jerk.  Ana does stand up to Mrs. Robinson at the dinner in the bathroom when she's trying to intimidate her - I like Ana for a split second.  Then she goes back to her whiny/jealous self.<br /><br /> These two are insanely jealous of each other - to the point of abnormal. If a woman talks to Christian, Ana gets mad and vice-versa.  It goes on and on about her picking fights with Christian - not to mention his jealousy if a guy even looks at her. I start to get bored with this book by chapter 12. They are terrified the other will leave - how is this a normal relatinship again?  Then comes Leila.  The creepy, stalker ex-girlfriend.  The drama ups when she confronts Ana in her office building and then slashes Ana's tires.  She breaks into Christian's house to which Christian becomes extremely paranoid.  Several things about this - first, why didn't he call the police on her crazy self? Because he thinks she needs help not prison, secondly,if he's so rich why doesn't he have an alarm system?  I'm confused.  And he tells Ana \\"she has a concealed weapons permit and can go buy a gun\\".  Newsflash you don't need a concealed license to buy a gun!! I laughed at this.<br /><br />Christian becomes quite paranoid.  He claims he wants to \\"protect\\" Ana.  I call it control, but that's just me.  Soon, she has to have his permission to leave the house, go to work, go to conferences - it's just sad.  He even BUYS HER COMPANY and claims if she leaves he will buy her next company. He is worried her boss will try to seduce her and wants full control of her whole life - because he says \\"I take good care of what's mine\\".  What a guy...<br /><br />This book becomes more comical than suspensful. The British slang, when Christian tells Ana he makes roughly $100,000.00 an hour Right, ok - at the age 27....doing what exactly we aren't quite sure.  We learn of Christian's abuse from his childhood - Ana constantly making excuses for his behavior because \\"he's sad and broken\\".  This woman is so pathetic - she even claims \\"I don't know that I could ever leave him no matter what he did to me and betray him again\\".  WOW - and how is this not an abusive relationship again? the constant guilt trips?<br /><br />For everyone thinking this is a romantic relationship - please think long and hard for a second.  Imagine real life - you meet Mr. Casanova (aka Christian Grey) - you are swept off your feet.  Then he takes you to his place and he has a room - just to have sex in - let alone it's called \\"Red Room of Pain\\".  Call me crazy - but I think you would take off running for the hills wondering who this emotionally retarted guy is that you just had dinner with.<br /><br />I'm bored with their childish, high school, jealous, controlling relationship. I hope something changes about this in the 3rd book.  I don't know how the author manages to still keep it a page turner though. If you can look past the hideous grammar - where were the editors?  The repetitive writing - my GOD she \\"flushes\\" a lot - I was to the point I laughed when read flushed, delicious, handsome - we get it Christian is hot and has a large penis. Don't need reminding on every other page. If you can get past all this - it's interesting seeing Christian in (what he calls) love.
B005GIS23I|5.0|I've watch this movie several times and still laugh out loud. The more you know science-fiction movies, the more you were going to appreciate this masterpiece.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The good thing about a show like The Walking Dead is that you can watch it again and usually find something you missed the first time. Even if you are not a fan of the zombie genre, these are some really good stories about how people react in times of tragedy and change. Try it, you'll like it!
0385366752|4.0|Very disturbing but also very clever with surprising twists and turns.  Two unlikeable main characters in a gripping story.<br />It was easier to handle in audio format than print.
B00C1BHQXK|1.0|I bought the book driven by the awesome reviews which later I realized are obviously fake. Want to learn about Pareto and the 80/20 rule in 2013? Then go and buy it.<br /><br />Just ONE idea explained in a whole book. I don't recommend it.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I set an alarm for 7:30 and at 7:40 it hadn't gone off! !! but it does give the weather which is nice
141694737X|5.0|This is a simple but darling book.  What kid doesn't like animals?  But not all animals make good pets...!  The zoo keeps trying out different animals, and then finally gets it right in the end!  The only thing I don't like is...I wish I had found this book sooner!  I would get this book early...first 6 months even.  Your baby will love it.  My toddler still does.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love this app worth 7 bucks and its going to have multiplayer so you can play with people around the world! Next Update 0.7.0!
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I really liked this movie.  I see why it got nominated for so much.  Very well acted.  Everyone should watch Silver Linings Playbook.  Don't want to say much and give anything way.  It was just great to watch.  Highly recommend!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is an action packed game that is full of the one thing that most gamers love ,but this game is also a wallet eater so if you are okay with spending money on a game with zombies then this is your type of game.
0679805273|5.0|We bought this for our 1 year old son and will have his important people, teachers and mentors write in it over the years and give it to him when he turns 18.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|It's a dictionary! Very functional & helpful when you don't know how to spell the word you are try'g to look up!!
B001JIDE3M|3.0|The movie is interesting and humorous at times, but the story is easy to figure out.<br />Acting is poor but acceptable. At times it is a little annoying, but they make fun of it a bit later.
031219126X|4.0|The additional information that the book has is great if you need ideas for essays. Also, it helps you understand the story from different perspective.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|ok, for the purests out there, this is not the play you saw on stage, at least it is a little different from what i saw. it is also different from the full symphonic version too...but then, those are also different from the book. the story is the same though and many things from both stage and book are here.<br /><br />i wasn't fond of Russle Crowe's singing but then it can't be PERFECT all the way through.<br /><br />it still makes me cry when i watch it like it has from the first time i watched it on stage. this is a great movie and the only one aside from avengers i saw in theaters last year. when you do get it, make sure you have a big enough screen to watch it on because it doesn't do it justice to watch it on a small screen
B000N3T0DW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The story line was not predictable and yet it was very enjoyable, without today´s usual violence.  Bonus, the language was all Spanish which was exactly what I was looking for.
B005TD4GTO|5.0|Loving his songs already when he was with Oasis, now everytime I listen to the album just want to smile and enjoy the moment.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I will recommend this book to all people who like gadget, pc, and IT.<br /><br />His biography looks like a fiction drama. but it's real.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I love this movie...  Excellent storyline with an absolutely perfect cast.  This conveys such raw emotion it will tear your heart into pieces and leave you crying and begging for more.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Got this tool recently since I could not find calc that suites my needs. This one is just great, easy to use, clear interface.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|For those of us who don't have the time to sit down and read.  I drive 1.5 hours to and from work daily, perfect for the drive.  Obviously much more detail than the show.  Roy Dotrice is amazing as the reader and does the characters voices very well.  You won't be disappointed.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Well written<br /> Makes you think about what universally means and what prices people will pay for what they think is right.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The Piano Guys make my day with every new song! Classical music meeting modern twists makes for a great listening experience.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|My son loves anything to do with Lord of the Rings and loves this movie! I would recommend this movie.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci scores another smash hit.  He writes in a style that allows you to move rapidly through the story.  He brings in new characters with enough introduction so you know who they are without spending page after page of meaningless background that contributes nothing to the story line like so many authors do to fill pages.  I can't wait for his next novel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game helps with responsibility and caring.that's why I love MY HORSE.I just love this game so much.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's too bad Mitch Rapp doesn't work for our government, I think the world would be a safer place.  As always, a well written fast paced clandestine thriller.  Stan Hurley is likeable and funny!  Who would of thought?  Worth your time.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|You must add this to your collection and especially if you have the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. It completes the collection perfectly! It serves as Tolkien intended. It is the prequel to the trilogy and a certain favorite for all who love the Tolkien stories. Highly recommend this for anyone wondering how Bilbo turned his experiences into the foreshadowing of Frodo's adventures.
0062124293|5.0|Extremely amusing and relatable. Moran's stream of consciousness writing surprises you at times with jokes you didn't even see coming.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater, bought the VHS version immediately after it was released, and now am replacing that with the DVD. This movie is certainly one of the best of all time epics and will be a treasure for many years to come. No issues witht he DVD quality, so this is a keeper.
B002O2THRO|2.0|The movie shows its age with 70s music, even 70s hair although the setting is 1925. I remembered the movie being better than the book (which is unusual for me), but upon my recent viewing of the movie, I concluded that both are overrated. Here's hoping that the upcoming version of the movie improves on the original!
B00004RFCM|5.0|This product came as promised and was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was quick and I was super excited to have the show on DVD!
B005OP7162|5.0|One of my favorite shows, and I didn't watch it initially because I didn't think I'd like it.  Title doesn't do it justice.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This product came as promised and was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping was quick and I was super excited to have this on blu ray!
B0068C9M3U|1.0|At $1.29 I thought I was getting a full song. The interlude is sold for full song price. That is a rip off!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I loved this movie and have watched it many times.  Decided to go and buy a copy for myself too.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|The recording was top quality and so was your customer service. Bocelii is greatly apprecited in my household. I was glad to recieve the recording with additional tracks. We look forward to receiving more music from him.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Mad Men is great! I like the storyline and also the acting, its is a period of time that is very interesting.
B00097E4A6|5.0|What is a full train set without a bridge.  My Grandson's Great Grandparents bought this for their Great Grandson for Christmas.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Good action western movie.  Another Tarantino classic. The movie was 3 hours long, but it never fealt like it. Love to see more.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I am a big fan.  I love being able to pop this into my DVD and watch whenever I'm in the mood to see it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  One of the best Tom Clancy books yet.  You are put right into the stress of the action.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love all of the episodes.  I watch reruns of it on TV everyday.  Now I'm able to watch even when there is no show on.
B0075MFS9Y|1.0|I liked their song from the TV commercial - that was the only song on this CD that I would call music. Everything else sounded the same and it was all very slow and not very musically appealing to me.
034580404X|5.0|I had read a friends 1st book and had to get the series for myself...so glad I did!!  Evolving story that wont let you put it down,
B0090SI460|5.0|We lost our DVD version so when the blue ray came out we bought it for the kids. This is a well done show and very entertaining.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I thought that this is one of the best calculator apps I have ever come across. A must get for every one!!!!
B0095P31L6|3.0|Cute --- but more for kids.  But, I kept reading how good this movie was so gave it a try.  Computer generated movies are fabulous eye-candy but I just couldn't get into the story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book! I loved the views from different countries and how they went through it.  The short stories really kept me wanting to keep reading waiting for the next one.
B007N6NGYG|1.0|Maybe I didn't give it enough of a chance, but it really hasn't captured my imagination.  I downloaded it and think I want to reclaim the space for something else...
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|The story line is engrossing and believable and the character development is excellent so far.  I can't wait for next week!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a great quality program in a quality package.  If you like Game of Thrones, obviously you'll enjoy this.  I haven't tried to use the digital copies yet, but I will do that for my next big trip.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Fantastic reading in a uniquely written style. A real feel good ending to a historical time of hardship and uncertainty.
034580404X|5.0|very ineresting and spell binding...kept my interest..i loved all three books..i hope they write a siquel to show if they get back together!!
1878424505|5.0|while not necessarily a book from the gods , but a book of knowledge and wisdom on how to live your everyday life , this is a very good book to help you cope with everyday life , and it gives you a inner look on how the world was seen in the eyes of the (Toltec)  starting with the basic four agreements ,<br /><br />First Agreement - \\"Be impeccable with your words \\"<br /><br />Second Agreement - \\"Don't take Anything Personally \\"<br /><br />Third Agreement - \\"Don't make assumptions \\"<br /><br />Fourth Agreement - \\"Always Do Your Best\\"
B000063DFN|5.0|Orders early tue am, arrived wed noon!  Product in great packaging, perfect condition!!  A bit more money than wanted to pay for cd's from '80's, but well monies spent!  Recommend highly!!!  10 Stars!!!  Rock on!!  \m/<br />  Great Steve Harris guitar works on riffs here...Bruce Allmighty on vocals brings the anvil down on this awesome group!! This entire cd will blast you into eternal rockdom!!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was amazing I couldn't put it down and have read it over and over again and have shared it with everyone I know. Each time I read it I want so badly for clay and Hannah to be together, but that's what I love too that not everything has a happy ending in life!
B000063COX|5.0|Orders early tue am, arrived wed noon!  Product in great packaging, perfect condition!!  A bit more money than wanted to pay for cd's from 1980, but well monies spent!  Recommend highly!!!  10 Stars!!!  Rock on!!  \m/
0345803493|5.0|Book was definitely incredible, I love the attention to detail. E. L. James, you are definitely an astounding author!! I have told everyone I know about your books and recommended them to anyone I can. I have to say, in all honesty, this was some of the best money I have ever spent, thank you.
1595828753|5.0|This story starts off just after Ozai is dethroned and talks about dealing with getting the 4 nations back in harmony.  One particular Fire Nation town in the Earth Kingdom proves problematic, however, because they refuse to go along with a separation back to pre-war nationalities.  As you read this trilogy it becomes clear this is the beginning of Republic City as evidenced in Legend of Korra.
0345803485|5.0|All three of the books in this Trilogy were amazing!!! I definitely wish there was more!! And I would recommend to anyone and everyone!!
B003PGNBO8|5.0|Flash Forward is a far fetched premise, but manages to deliver powerfully in each segment. The characters are well developed and sympathetic, and the suspense is palpable. I watched it once before, but thought I was getting more episodes when I bought it this time. I just can't understand why they didn't go on with it. So disappointing.
0345803507|5.0|I actually cried!! Oh My God!! So amazing, and I cannot thank you enough for this amazing trilogy, I loved all the books. So sad that there aren't more though. I really wish there was another one, just an idea!!! Thank you so much for the amazing journey, it was incredible!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I am really enjoying this game,the second time around. I have it on both my desktop and my kindle. It works great on either device. Visually it's a very beautiful game and a reasonable level of difficulty,which requires a basic amount of common sense. I highly recommend it!
B00190OHD6|1.0|My wife wanted me to buy this for her. I have seen it once. Great movie. Well done. Okay, lets move on shall we? Fellas I am speaking to you. If you have done something to piss your wife off one day and she so happens to dive into this movie, you are going to look much worse. Anything she may dislike about your general being will be amplified ten-fold. You will never achieve such a meaningful relationship as this film shows us blah blah blah. You had better be on her good side if this movie is hanging out in the background.
0307474259|5.0|The book promotes low/no carb and explains why. What is uncertain it it also will tell you. But this is a book which says, what is accepted facts about obesement today, are not based on science. So if you are counting calories, you must be able to accept that things you know, maybe are not true. If you can't or won't be able to change your mind, don't buy this book.<br />To people who try to get fitter (without any luck), buy this book and give it a try.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I do not have a TV and missed the original showing. I have wanted to purchase it for a long time, but my son advised I waited because I was going to get the HD version and he was doubtful that it would survive. He was right and then this special edition came along. The price was great, it arrived quickly and we absorbed it piece by piece over time. A lifetime treasure if you like nature, and what to explore the wonders of nature like never before.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I've just started to read this and find it as good a read, so far as the previous 4 books.<br />More great characters, locations and adventures.<br />Looking forward to more about Arya, Brienne and Tyrion.
0062014536|2.0|I don't know who decided that it was edgy?  real?  cool?  to leave stories somewhat unfinished.  Open-ended and unresolved.<br />I get that REAL-LIFE doesn't come tied up in pretty packages, with nice & tidy resolutions to all problems.  Sure, I get it.<br />But this is not REAL LIFE.  It's a novel.  And if I take the time to read... not one, not TWO, but THREE books.... and I've become somewhat invested in these characters.... I want to know what HAPPENS.  I know they're not real.  Bah!  I don't even care if you choose to do a tragic ending.  At least it would final and we can move on.  It was somewhat of a cowardly thing to do -- could Oliver not come to a reasonable and satisfactory ending to that horrible love-triangle (Alex or Julian?)  No clear, redefined relationship between Lena & her mom?  Unsure of who cured-Hana will be, now that's she's broken from the safety of the norm?  See....Oliver left it all up in the air and I can't work it all out in my head, how it should end.  Just round and round...  Such a disappointment!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I was a little hesitant to read this book before the movie, but I'm glad I did. What a powerful story about living life to the fullest regardless of what life throws your way. Overcoming and adapting to the harshest of situations while being open to the beauty all around you.<br /><br />Can't wait to see how the powerful imagery translates to the big screen.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|So glad that my boss left early one afternoon and I decided to watch this movie!  Very brave performances by the actors in the main rolls.  And to think this movie is based on a true story.  Heart breaking and inspirational at the same time.  Watch this movie!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Sorry folks, the &#34;App&#34; never downloaded, lot of other junk but not the &#34;App&#34;.  Given a fair shot I should try once again in the future, but really do not need all the&#34; buy these books&#34;, &#34;games&#34; and other adds; really just wanted the &#34;App&#34; boy what a disappointment; junk, junk and more junk not no APP.
B00631VJIC|4.0|You will probably like this CD.  I just wish they had put some more of their &#34;rockin&#34; songs on.  There are quite a few songs that are mellow.  It's great to hear Katie on some of the tracks!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was lame.  Poorly written, poorly researched, zero depth.  Great sex scenes, but unfortunately that was not enough to redeem this book.  It was also not enough to get to me buy or read the next two books.  I kind of can't believe there is enough story to put into two more books.  Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something else.
B009AMANH4|3.0|I did not realize the whole plot revolved around the one issue. I was looking for a more expanded view of Lincoln with the issue, his generals, the whole thing. Day-Lewis was great, plot not what I expected.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and didn't want it to end. The themes and characters of The Name of the Wind are continued and developed and deepened; the episodes and adventures are absorbing; there are enough new twists to keep you interested; the writing is smooth and doesn't get in your way with its trickiness or cleverness; you finish this book and already you're looking for the next volume to find out what happens next. A very enjoyable read.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|will play but gold and diamonds. are gone next time I play. if you wait you get free hearts every 8 min.
B00BAYLQI0|3.0|From the outset, the astute viewer understand that this is, above all, a suspense story, where the ending means everything. So why would you title it, \\"The Impossible\\"?  To any number of viewers, this title forecasts a heroic outcome which, in turn, severely undermines the suspense level of the film. My other thought was that the CGI of the Tsunami wasn't nearly as good as that produced in the film, \\"Hereafter.\\" Also, why does the husband look exactly like \\"Dexter\\".
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|This dictionary did not work on my Kindle Fire. I tried numerous times and finally gave up, and will look for another dictionary to download.
B0071BGOJC|1.0|This book was a waste of money based on the other books of Mr. Follett's that I have read. The characters had no depth, and their dialogues were so superficial and childish that I could barely finish reading this book.<br />It followed all of the necessary issues required to be politically correct which made it lack any creativity and was too formulaic to be considered anything remotely related to literature.  This was more of an attempt at indoctrination rather than a simple novel to sit back and relax with.<br />I WON'T be wasting my money on the third one or any other future work. Mr Follett do your own work, don't let the government do it for you.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|This is just a brief shout out to the reviewers who praised this DVD of Furtwangler conducting this Golden Age performance. I love Furtwangler but have trouble with the sonics of most of his recordings. So I assumed this would also be a tinny sounding DVD. Boy was I wrong. The sound is great, the picture clear, the singers are great, the acting is natural and effective, the sets impressive. Furtwangler starts out a bit slowly in the overture but then leads the orchestra in an unforgettable performance. One of my most treasured opera DVDs!
B005PK56TA|5.0|Freaky scary lol..very good story..good image..overall I give it 2 thumbs up..very happy with amazon instant video (prime) and all of the cool movies, and tv shows.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Will have to reread this very carefully.  Hope there's a sequel.  Don't want a spoiler alert but very interesting story.  Too much filler regarding history in the back.  Would have chosen more story without the hoopla.  Will look a few more of Mr. Sanderson's writings and see if he's a consistent author.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Very good.  However,I could have done without the use of The Lord's name and Christ's name in vain.  I believe the story would have been just as good without the language.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Excellent movie!  Wonderful story, and some really funny parts.  Although kids like it, the messages are very deep, and this is extremely enjoyable for adults as well!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Good story weaving the killing of an American enemy combatant with the perils of Yemen; but the ending leaves much to be desired.<br />The technique John Corey used to kill the Panther was pretty lame as was their physical struggle.<br />We were led to believe all escape routes from Yemen were closed or at least unacceptable; but nonetheless the good guys somehow returned intact to meet in New York. How did they get out of Yemen? Were the tele-ported to the USA?
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Very addictive. Graphic is very nice. Fun little game. Recommend this game. And the price is right. Definitely one of the better games.
B008220D7S|4.0|Well, despite some negative reviews, and despite some of the comments here, I loved that movie. It's funny and a pretty good portrayal of married people in their 40s. I intend to buy the Blu Ray.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The first book in the series was fantastic but in my opinion required a great deal of concentration, trying to keep all the characters and histories straight.  This book while still involving layers of mystery, reads a bit cleaner.  Somewhat more traditionally.  Great suspense, a good story, great characters.
B009NLC1D6|5.0|This was a very well written, filmed, and acted movie.  This movie was very entertaining, while also providing a great deal of historical information at the same time.  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, to the point that we are sure to watch it again.
B005RZ8W94|5.0|I bought this for my mom and she is IN LOVE with it. One of the concerts is recorded in a non-English speaking country but the songs and sound quality is awesome.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|always helpful when in the car and not around a charger. also helps me keep the battery in good shape.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Only two characters in the book are likable - the sister and the (woman) police officer.  All others had such great flaws, that it was hard to find any sympathy for any one of them.  I  finished the book because it was our book club pick of the month.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition, Minecraft PE, and so far the in-browser demo version on computer. I would buy it on Pc but I need to get a computer that can produce enough frames per second because I don't want my first full version of Minecraft Pc to be really laggy. All versions of Minecraft are worth the money!!!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book is a wonderful insight into the Cabinet of Lincoln.  It really points out his compassion, and his willingness to listen to all points of view before making decisions.  I would recommend this book to everyone, and it should be required reading in all history classes.
B003ZMF26W|5.0|Using it for gaming but works for school, surfing and mundane tasks as well. I found the setup to be involved but not overly intricate or complicated.  I like the settings that can be changed for gaming or every day use.  I have been able to keybind over 16 commands to my mouse using combos in order to create a more fluid game experience.  It's smooth and I don't find the cord giving me trouble at all, it was a little stiff but it feels like a shoe lace, and has loosened up a bit.  The mouse IS plug and play, but if you do that you're wasting ALL the features and could have bought a much cheaper mouse for that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Easy to use, fun graphics, cute &quot;mini games.&quot; Unlock more as you level. Gems earned each level and energy gained over time. Younger ones may enjoy caring for their own horse.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|A real page turner, so many twists to this story,the path it takes is absolutely unguessable and leaves you thinking all the steps through in the end
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This was a great book a and left me wanting more every time I put it down thank you for a great book.<br /><br />  ~Rachel Chadwell
B003B02O7I|4.0|My first grisham and I loved this book.  Not what I was expecting but that was refreshing.  I will certainly read more by mr. grisham
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Love this movie, can watch it over and over and can t wait till number  2 movie comes out soon
B005T87QCI|1.0|really stupid don't buy it you half to buy alot I think its stupid I don't want to waste my money on robots just let us play the guys
1250012570|4.0|Truth? I don't really know what I'm supposed to say about this book. So many people have said so many things and so many of them are far more eloquent than I will ever be that I'm kind of at a loss. But I'll soldier on.<br /><br />Next truth? I didn't expect to like Eleanor and Park. With books like this that have SO MUCH hype even if I like it I never expect to like it as much as everyone else. Also, I'm kind of a cynical moron. Anyway, Eleanor and Park broke the mold because I liked it, I actually really liked it.<br /><br />One of my main concerns going in was whether I would be able to relate to the characters. The 1980s is a period that does nothing for me. I was born in 1985 and even looking at pictures of my parents holding me as a baby is enough to turn me off from that ridiculous decade. Also, while I wouldn't say I was popular in high school I also wasn't unpopular, I kind of was friends with all different groups, and sometimes (and I don't mean to sound like a moron about this) I find myself completely unable to relate to high school outcasts.<br /><br />All of that said I did find myself relating to Eleanor and to Park even though I have pretty much zero in common with either of them. Another one of my fears was that the book would be slow moving and more description and introspection, but it wasn't, I thought it moved along at a very rapid pace, which I definitely appreciate.<br /><br />Eleanor's mother and stepfather infuriated me. I felt so much compassion for her and so much anger at the life she was dealt. But also, I feel like I've read so many books with evil stepfathers lately and I'm kind of getting tired of it. I know there are good stepfathers out there. (Sorry, random aside.)<br /><br />Park's family was my absolute favorite. While I don't want to replace my parents or grandparents, I would like to take Park's mom and dad and grandparents on as a second family. One of my favorite parts, actually the only note I look while reading it (can you tell from this very scattered review?), was how in the parts of the book told from Park's perspective his mom speaks in broken English and he's obviously embarrassed by it, but in Eleanor's POV his mom speaks in \\"normal\\" English. I thought that was an amazing way to highlight Park's insecurities.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Yes, absolutely, I thought it was great and completely worth reading. Do I think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread? No, but I am happy it actually lived up to a lot of the hype.tell from this very scattered review?), was how in the parts of the book told from Park's perspective his mom speaks in broken English and he's obviously embarrassed by it, but in Eleanor's POV his mom speaks in \\"normal\\" English.

B000L53D4O|1.0|This push toy has no foundation or stability.  My daughter fell multiply times trying to pull up.  Spend the extra money and get a wooden model with a solid base.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|In the same way that freakonomics held me captive and made me aware of the many sides and intricacies into socioeconomic cause and effect, this book did the same by including great insight about how our minds develop habits. And how to break the ones you dislike...
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is a great book.  McCourt shares his life story with humor threaded through the tragic events of his childhood.
1936608898|5.0|This book holds alot of information about how food works with your body.  It's a great resource.  I've been following the whole 30 plan for 54 days and I have lost 11 pounds.

B00AZKCU7G|3.0|This wasn't my all-time favorite performance by Daniel. But it was still entertaining to watch him do what he does best. He immerses himself 101 percent into Lincoln. It's just that the film as a whole just seemed like a 2 1/2 hour history lesson. And Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens was very exceptional to say the least. Not a bad film. But not a great one either.
B005HSL626|5.0|Who doesn't like FREE!<br /><br />Thanks so much.<br /><br />We don't play it much at all - in fact - I haven't played it after a couple of days since I downloaded.<br /><br />BUT -- We have it when the Grandkids come & we are weary of trying to entertain them. YAY!<br /><br />Else I try to get them to like Doctor Who BBC TV series - Classic & New Who. (The mild stories until they get older!)
B00C1XZ2LQ|4.0|I saw this flick on opening weekend and I must say one of the most memorable highlights of Oblivion was the musical score. I knew that the director of this film was the same director who did Tron Legacy and I loved that film. The score by Daft Punk in that picture was superb. In Oblivion it seems as if the director wanted the same feel musically for this as well. M83 does a somewhat companion to Tron Legacy's score which I'm all game for. My top 3 highlights in this soundtrack would have to be I'm Sending You Away, Tech 49, and Starwaves. I give this soundtrack a solid B grade.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Great movie!  I loved the performances by Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Samuel L. Jackson.  I think Quentin Tarantino is a great filmmaker. I hope to see more of Christoph Waltz, I think he is a terrific actor.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|This book allowed me to see what I was doing in a totally different light.<br />It affirmed much of what I was doing - however, I was &#34;winging&#34; it most of the time.<br />After reading the book, indeed, while reading it, I realised just how much I was doing right but also how much I could do better.<br /><br />Buy it! Read it! It really does make a difference.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Great classic coming of age movie.  The stars, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy, all gave great performances.  These stars all went on the have long acting careers.
B008PZZD68|4.0|It may be an older movie but it was pure fun.  The story line was not predictable like I thought it would be.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the story could have been a little more detailed instead it was a little rushed leaving me wanting to know more about the ship and the &#34;aliens&#34;.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Great Movie.  I love Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.  I loved them in Paul and Shaun of the Dead, too
B00BIVN82M|1.0|I was looking forward to this album with great anticipation as Buble has not put out new material in some time.  I rushed to obtain the album on the first day of its release.  After playing through the album I came away feeling empty and unmoved.  Buble to me has followed in the footsteps of Frank Sinatra in many ways.  On this current album he performs sevral Sinatra numbers, notably Something Stupid & Young At Heart.  He adds nothing new to these renditions so why do them?  The album is way too commercial and to my ears has no standout songs. There are many outstanding songs he could have chosen so why waste our time on clone versions of Something Stupid & Young At Heart.  Why not duet with a real singer like Tierney Sutton, Roseanne Vitro or Dianne Reeves.  Reese Witherspoon?  Come on.

B000H4QD1O|5.0|The series is on sale again in the Gold Box lightening deals and I thought \\"it's been a long long time since I watched it\\" (bought it in 2005) I remember then watching it all the way through in a marathon and getting so dang angry with Fox for canceling it...here it is nearly 11 years since the last episode and I watched the first episode again tonight, just as fresh, just as entertaining, just as captivating as the first time I watched it and I'm almost just as upset with Fox for canceling it. If you haven't seen it, it's worth the time and money to watch it if you're not a Prime Member, if you are a Prime Member it's worth the time.<br /><br />By the way, Nathan Fillion is so much more MALE in Firefly than he is in Castle, Joss Whedon knows how to write for and develop his male characters.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the game, but hare the ads.  The only way I can get rid of most of them is to close then reopen the game.  All ads should have a &quot;close &quot; or &quot;skip &quot; button.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|It's very nice and the graphics are very good. It' It'Bus too expensive for the lenght of the game... I finished it in 3 hours!!!

B0025TOH5S|5.0|It is a movie with great humor.  Glodie Hawn is at her best in this movie and Steve Martin does a great job.  It's a fun story that is really funny.
B000FA675C|4.0|I tried to read this a couple of years ago and undoubtedly was not in the mood.  I am glad that I decided to give it another try.  It was fantastic.
B000002UZU|5.0|For any blues afficionado, this is a must.  John Lee and Canned Heat join together to make great music.  This is a classic album for sure
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian has made a great workout video in the 30 Day Shred. 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, 1 minute of abs, repeat 3 times. Breaking it up in this way makes the workout a breeze to accomplish and by the time you're on the second set you're thinking to yourself &#34;Well I'm almost done anyway so I might as well finish.&#34;<br /><br />Great for rainy days when I can't run or for the entire winter when I can't bring myself to run in the snow!
B0051OZ564|4.0|I saw the commercials for this a really long time ago and thought I'd try renting it just to appease my curiosity. I went in thinking this was going to be a boob fest with tons of shooting and just be a random &#34;meh&#34; action flick. Luckily, I was pleasantly surprised that there really wasn't any nudity and cursing was kept to a minimum. Unlike most action flicks the story was pretty deep and the action was merely a vacation from dire predicaments that I would have rather of not seen anyway. This was very tastefully done, so I highly recommend this to rent or buy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is fun and a perfect time waster. I love all the extras they added and enjoy this one more than the first! My only little complaint is that the gems are a little difficult to get but, considering the fact that I think the first doesn't even have gems, it's not that big of a deal. I recommend this app. (Also, if you like Temple Run, try Subway Surfers. It's very similar to Temple Run and very enjoyable. It's just as fun yet, has its own twists.)
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I first tried this game on my brother's ipod, and then had to get it for my kindle. I loved it and so did all of my siblings. It was easy and fun to play, and we liked that with our facebooks joined with it, we could compete against each other. I had almost made it to the top of my friends when I had a problem with it. The game worked, but it lost all of my data and started me completely over. On my brother's games, it still showed me at the top but no matter how much I played it didn't change my score on theirs, and their didn't even show on mine. I uninstalled the game since I didn't want to have to do everything again and haven't played since. I kind of miss it but it's not really worth my tme since it erased it all.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|This was not a bad read, but it doesn't live up to the hype.  I guess I just expected too much.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery app is proving to be very reliable.  The battery app shows clearly when my battery is charged and also the percentages of battery power remaining. All of the graphs are clear and easy to read and understand.

B004P1JEXE|4.0|This is the forth book in the Games of Thrones series and was as good as the ones that had gone before.  It followed directly on from the third book, was easy to follow and continued the same format with each chapter being about a different character although only half of the original characters story-lines are developed.  At the end of the book there was a nice little message from the author expaining why he had only developed half of the characters and what and who the fifth book was about, which was great to push me into immediately buying the fifth book.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|The quality was fine but a movie about children hunting each other is extremely disturbing! Days later, I can't get those awful images out of my head!

B008JFUO9K|4.0|Source: [...]    One thing for sure, the movie does address the question \\"does the man make the suit or does the suit make the man\\". For Marvel comic fan, especially an Iron Man lover, then you'll immediately find out that it went off the track quite a lot when you're expecting a lot of similarity to the Extremis. If you really enjoy the first two movies, you might find this one to be less satisfying in some ways.    Let's talk about hero personality exploration, this department feels a little bit empty here. Somehow, we have to figure out the thoughts inside Tony's mind and the things that trouble him the most ourselves. Seeing how the relationship between Tony and Pepper has grown though is really nice and very reassuringly comforting. Did we create our own demon or make our own enemies? Perhaps so, as the man before the birth of his armour constantly spread the seed of jealousy and metaphorically created a sea full of green-eyed monsters. Watching these \\"demons\\" taking revenge on the world around Tony and Tony himself is strangely familiar enough so to speak. There's nothing to be worried about actually as Tony always have some tricks up his sleeves.    Are you expecting S.H.I.E.L.D. to be somehow involved? Is anyone missing Director Fury? \\"Nothing feels the same since (our ever order obeying Agent Coulson left us), you experience things...\\" No one is trying to be nostalgic here but his part did bring some extra hint of flavour to the live action film of Marvel comic. The product of Extremis seems horrible and freaky. They're surely a little bit too overpowered and look almost impossible for Tony himself to take down all of them. Somehow, they feel too mighty to be real but Iron Man is part of Marvel and they're about superheroes and fantasy. No matter where your imagination might lead you, they're all within reason for this genre of film. So, if you like things to be more realistic, then this won't be quite your cup of tea. Twist or no twist, as the plot is building up towards the climax, it certainly leaves more to be desired.    Our man of the show, Robert's performance is sometimes over-the-top but he still stay true to what Tony is supposed to be: narcissistic, confident and on top of all, being stylish and cool. Remember what Captain Rogers said about Tony is \\"all about style\\" in The Avengers. He truly lives up to that.  Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall's role aren't really well developed but should be suffice for the not-so-character focus in this time around. They're convincing enough but there are rooms for improvement. So if you just want a charismatic lead actor, you have it. He's there and he's never been better.    The dialogue for most of the parts is well considered but you may find certain portion to be clichéd. They're funny and possibly way too funny at times. There are some moments where you think you might actually be watching a comedy. The movie is full of action so you action junkie out there won't be disappointed. Well, even the lead actress has a few moves of her own, you should get the idea.    This theatrical cut is definitely gratifying to the eyes and the ears. Videophile & audiophile alike will be pleased. The movie almost feels three dimensional for most of the time even when you're watching it on just Digital 2D. I remember there's this scene at Tony's mansion, the front props are almost popping out of the screen which is to say, amazing. The depth and focus are excellent. The low lighting portion of the movie is surprisingly detail, defined and not too grainy at all. Choose a good seat at the cinema and get ready to be immersed into the world of Tony Stark. For audio, the surround activity is as what you'll be expecting from a superhero-action movie. The musical soundtrack is very engaging too thanks to Brian Tyler's excellent arrangement. All in all, it's a reference grade video presentation. Audio is well engineered so it's easy on the ears and they shouldn't be fatigue over time.    Okay, here's a note of warning, this is not a G-rated movie so parental guidance is highly advisable for audiences below the age of 13. The mix of action violence and some mild adult theme in it do stir things up a bit so just be aware of that. If you're anyhow in some sort of hurry, do yourself a favour and leave when the credit rolls. There isn't much uncovering in the post credit scene and its Blu-ray is going to be out soon so don't worry.    Generally speaking, Iron Man 1 and 2 were superb and this sequel is nonetheless good. So think of it as the Nolan's Batman Trilogy, Batman Begins was a stepping stone to the splendid peak of The Dark Knight then The Dark Knight Rises came and conclude the legend. Don't let the downside of this sequel mark you down. Lower your expectation and you'll have a good time enjoying this pre-Summer blockbuster of 2013. Just buckle up and be blown away by Tony's new toys! Whether or not Iron Man is making a return, the chances are, it's on us.    Cheers and go watch the movie now!!!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|There should be more than five stars to give this wonderful movie.  It is captivating to watch.  The story and characters evoke deep emotions that cause the viewer to care deeply about the people, even the character played by Russel Crowe.  Hugh J was fascinating going from a beaten down criminal to a pious and successful man.  there wasn't a weak performance in the entire movie.  Not to mention the music first is rare in a musical review, but that does not mean the music was less.  It was wonderful as well.  The vocals were strong and full of emotion which is very difficult to do and hit the right notes at the same time.  Wonderful! Wonderful!  This movie will be on the top of my favorites list for a long time.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|Works perfectly and looks great.  Several people have commented that it's looks just like the Rolex Daytona. I strongly recommend this Invicta for everyday easy wear.
B007FDE4Y8|5.0|I liked it very much! The product was delivered on time, in perfect condition and it was very well packaged! I would put a manual on it to stabilise it but if you're pacient, you can figured it out!
B007N8RULO|5.0|At the most difficult level - 4 suit spider - this is a very difficult game.  I think it is the most challenging game I've ever played.  Out of hundreds of games, maybe thousands, so far I have won only 11.  I love the challenge.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I liked it very much! The product was delivered on time, in perfect condition and it was very well packaged! It's awesome and really usefull not only for games but for design!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Even as an adult, I watched this film twice in 48 hours.  Hilarious and brilliantly done. Always refreshing to still enjoy a cartoon from time to time.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it even more now that I have the 8&#34; kindle.  No more playing the little screen on my cell phone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is great!  I watched all the episodes in one night!  I couldn't turn it off.  Don't miss it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I used to play Angry Birds Rio on my cell phone.  What a difference using a BIG screen.  Also love not having an ads pop up.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|The book is well written, and very easy for anyone to read, and everyone should read the book.  I was delightfully surprised.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is anothe game that I chose for my grand children to play. It keeps them occupied for some time.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I find the characters to be believable, and think the actors are great.<br />I find myself sighing and thinking &#34;oh, of course it will do this way next&#34; - and then it doesn't.  The main character is classy, cool as ice, smart, and interesting.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I'm sure it's not Kindle's fault... but sheesh... I hate the way this AP is set up... and why oh why can't I access my game aps on this feature?
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I like how the themes mirror real events in the news - a good touch.  I like the long-term issues that are playing out in the background, issues around how to raise teenagers, how to deal with a spouse who lies.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the trilogy over the week of my spring break.  It's an easy read, but has some deep ideas imbedded within.  Can't wait to see Catching Fire!
0547564651|5.0|It was entertaining and inspiring to here some of the anecdotes told in this story. I would read more by Mr. Tough.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Amazing that half of a nationality, the very bright, productive, critical Koreans, can become so brainwashed. This book gives the word &#34;totalitariansim&#34; a full meaning. Anyone who worries about the loss of privacy implied in modern technology and social media should read what can happen without those developments. Real democracy has become a messy affair, and thank heaven for that. Highly recommended.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Thought it would be funny like the movie knocked up not half as funny as that movie, very long and drawn out.
B004478AS4|4.0|Bland in some places but overall it teaches you a lesson about culture, customs, and the ways of a village in Africa. Tells the great story of a man who wasn't what he thought he was.
B000WN60NG|3.0|Good movie....great guitar solo and good music. Enjoyed it. Was impresses with the guitar solo for sure and a pretty good story. Wont regret it
B008IYR2BA|5.0|One of the best shows ever! But you'll need to set aside a large block of time, at least enough for three episodes back-to-back. It's addictive!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This DVD played easily and wonderfully.  Once hooked on Downton Abbey........what can I say?  I strongly recommend this DVD and its prior two season DVDs.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|It's a good story, but really only those who were paying attention to such things in the 1970s will understand and appreciate it.
B009RH9J7W|5.0|My mother wanted a cover for her Kindle Fire HD that would allow her to stand it freely on the table when her hands were busy.  It works perfect and she is very happy with it.
B006UUK612|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. It is a highly entertaining movie. I highly recommend this movie.
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|Very sad book but has a good ending! Unfortunately, there are crazy people in this world that would actually kidnap an individual & keep them for their own selfish & evil needs. Thank goodness this was only fiction! Makes you more aware of your surroundings and what happens in your own neighbourhood.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started watching all of the seasons about a month ago and immediately got hooked. It's interesting to experience what life would have been like living through such major life events like Titanic sinking or war or sweeping illness... or what it was like living as the uber wealthy, or the heirarchy of the servant world. God stuff.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I couldn't put the 1st book down so when the sequel came out I was just as eager to read it. Although, I must admit Fifty<br />Shades of Grey was the 1st novel I read in this type of category, once reading these series of books by Sylvia Day gives a totat new meaning of desire & lust. The writing in itself is more interesting & not repetitive like Fifty Shades. Looking forward to August when the last installation of this series is complete!<br />Great read!
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|The Eagles. Hell Freezes Over.<br /><br />Don Henley said in 1980 that the Eagles would get back together \\"When Hell Freezes Over\\", hence the name given to this album. The Eagles in this 2005 Geffen Records DVD video recording are coming back from a fourteen year break and performing a live MTV Special concert. When? Where? Who knows. There is no mention anywhere of when or where the concert took place. Some internet research told me that it took place at Warner Burbank Studios, in Burbank, California, on 25-26 April, 1994. A few of the new songs were recorded separately in a studio.  Anyway, it takes the Eagles a while to get back in the swing of things, as they have gotten a little rusty over the years from being out of practice, but once they settle down, it seems like they never split up. The video quality is excellent, but the audio quality sometimes suffers a bit from the problems that usually plague live concerts- audience noise, stage acoustics, and voices sometimes being drowned out by the instrumentals.  It is difficult if not impossible to get a clean mix with an impromptu setup on a stage in front of a crowd, so if a particular song is new or one you are not familiar with, you might wish you had liner notes containing the words to the songs so you know what they are singing. The liner notes contain a group photo of the Eagles, and a chapter index of the DVD, but that's it. This DVD contains 17 DVD songs, mostly their old hit songs, like \\"Hotel California\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", and \\"Take It Easy\\". The DVD has a few extras, consisting of some comments by the band members, and a few minutes of a tuneup session prior to the concert. There is also an audio version of the last song \\"Seven Bridges Road\\", and unfortunately, for that you need a DTS Decoder.  The song is not available to you otherwise. Bummer. I paid for the DVD, so I am entitled to hear all of the music, not most of it. Otherwise, this a great album.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I recommend this product to all Kindle Fire users, if only for the piece of mind that you are not going to run out of juice before the end of the book. Well worth a trial and its free!
1576875776|4.0|What an amazing archive. I love this woman's photography. Her focus, exposures, framing; everything was right on the money. This book is printed a little bit too dark for my taste. It feels like it could be a stop brighter in the midtones. OTW a very nice book. I'll purchase the other collection of her work when I can afford it. But, this is a nice intro, plenty to see here. I'm looking forward to the movie as well.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I watched the PBS program a few weeks ago and was motivated to learn more and possibly give it a try.  This looks like something I can do, and it gives me enough flexibility as to not fail.
B0039O8AQK|5.0|Keeps the dark feeling of the book - well done. I would give it 5 stars and it syas very close to the original book.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|Great case for my Kindle fire 7&#34;. Very good quality and really protects the kindle very well. Only problem is when we need to charge the kindle there is no opening in the case so you need to do it with it open. No big deal though.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|I re-read this book since I was young... This is such a great book! Any grownups need to read this book.

B00992CF6W|3.0|I liked a lot!! worked great on Kindle Fire, but I always had to open it in the app store- sometimes it didn't work either to play
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was disappointed with the ending and could not get into this  book the way I did the first two books.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|This book is too hard to me. I have to spend a whole life to read all the words inside.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Brings us back to the realization that the only thing that matters in this life is our relationships and how our loved ones cannot be replaced with anything.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The game is awesome, it does a mind good. It helps me to calm down and relax. This game helps relieve a lot of stress.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|When I first heard about this show, I didn't think I would like it much. I'm very glad I gave it a try because this program has excellent acting and writing. I am completely drawn into the world of Downton Abbey, and I can't escape it.
B005FISBTO|5.0|What's not to love?! One of the greatest shows ever. I will miss this show not being on the air
1932100660|5.0|Our insidious diet heavy on animal and fish protein is indicted in this book which shows almost all of our preventable diseases and ailments are preventable by changing to a plant protein diet.
0374531269|5.0|If I could sum up this book in one word, it would be wow.  This book is truly inspirational.  How can someone go through what Ishmael Beah has been through and continue on living?  I can't say that if it were me in his shoes that I would be able to survive.  That is what Ishmael is, a survivor.  It is amazing that he is able to be in a good place, from what I got when reading his acknowledgments.  He once was an angry little boy that seemed like he would never heal and remain in his soldier past but he was able to overcome that.  It is sad to know that not every boy/soldier was as fortunate as Ishmael.  This book made me aware of my inner feminist.  As I got deeper into the novel, the more upset I became.  There were too many wrongdoings occurring.  Human rights were being violated left and right: from women being raped, men and children being tortured then later to be killed, their homes being burnt down.  I wish there was something that I could have done.  There was so much pain and suffering; and for all what?  Just because people are selfish.<br /><br />This book is definitely a book that you can't put down and stop reading.  Ishmael's book definitely made me realize what I take for granted.  For example, my freedom.  I am able to walk outside of my house and go down to the local grocery store to buy food without having to worry if it will be my last day alive.  Or that my loved ones will be tortured and taken away from me.  Reading this memoir made me really upset.  How can people be so selfish and close minded?  When is it ever okay to do such horrific things to one another?  How can Africa have so much history of corruption?  It is almost surreal!  I know that every country has history but it is a never ending cycle for Africa.  This book really opens your eyes and bring awareness to the issues that are occurring all over the world.
B0067TQQI8|3.0|The first idea to buy it was to have a capacity sufficient to recharge my devices, if necessary. This aspect is followed correctly.<br />It does happens the same with the speed with which it does. At the very least, double the promised upload speed, ie instead of 2A and 1A should indicate 1A and 0.5 A. This is a bit frustrating at times when you need that recharge in a limited time.<br />Conclusion: it's not bad, but does not even meet the expectations.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|Yea, he's done some light-weight, rather fun gore films, but this movie should be the one Adam Green is remembered for.  Gripping, terrifying and nauseating without resorting to buckets of blood, this taunt tale of terror is more affective than you might expect from the Hatchet franchise.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|As always it is an interesting story to read by the author. But, this new story might be a something of his new experiment; in the sense that it takes place in the social circle of British Intelligence establishment.<br /><br />Although I enjoyed reading the book, now that so many months have passed since I finished reading it, I feel the story gave me very little of the lasting impacts and images in my mind; thus the rating I gave.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I was never a fan of the animated show, but wow, this movie is awful.  Sure, Bay makes things look cool as they explode and stuff, but the plot is a mess, Optimus Prime is a total ass for letting so many people die just to prove humanity needs the Autobots as their guardians and who really cares that LaPuff's character can't find a job worthy of his imagined job skills?  If you must watch this turkey, skip till the last 40 minutes or so, as all the decent destruction happens then.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This is the book for almost anyone who is interested in historical novels. You enjoy reading it since the story seems to develop as the way any readers would expect or want to happen. But, such story telling is a double edged sword; it keeps readers glue to the pages but not much is left after finish reading it.<br /><br />May be I am spoiled by the impact I felt after reading The Winds of War.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|Wow, once you get past the anime style sequences, this film is rather flat.  It's not as complicated as some might have you believe, but that's not a good thing.  The film might claim to be some type of female empowerment coda, but it's too shallow to be effective, and it's hard to accept this as a feminist movie when you consider the number of anime style panty shots in the first major battle.  Looks great, but very hollow.
B00APUQPX6|5.0|loved this movie just like all the rest in this series, if you like this series, you wont be disappointed, very good.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Disney, what are you doing? Do you just NOT want to sell the 3D version of this movie on 3D? You know - or should know - that most of the more serious aficionados of movies and 3D would rather get the 3 disc version that contains both 3D AND 2D versions of the movie, so why change that all of a sudden? What clueless focus group told you different? Or was it the same clueless marketers that sunk \\"John Carter\\", let alone what they did to the title of that movie - which by itself should tell you how lousy they are. Straighten up and just release the 2D & 3D package together like you always have because at best, you're gonna' lose money on that two-disc 2D version anyway. Those of us that are serious about 3D will go ahead and get THAT version now, on its initial release in 3D - just like you hoped we would - but that two disc version - we'll just wait til it's cheaper in the bargain bins or from the secondary market before we get it, meaning they'll just sit on store shelves til you lose money on 'em. You can make more now or less later. Put on your Mousketeer thinking cap and figure it out. Whatever focus group or marketers you're listening to are Goofy.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I went through this game real fast. It was A OK.<br /><br />I was glad I could turn off the annoying sounds.<br /><br />Maureen
B004MOMT2M|5.0|Unbelievable. Rush has never sounded this good. They always sound amazing, but this is unreal. The sound is so full! I have listened to Moving Pictures hundreds of times, but I am hearing details I never heard before. Its seems so live and robust, even at very high volume levels. This is a MUST buy if you like this album, like Rush, or appreciate high quality audio. I can not believe how great this sounds...
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|The movie would be good even if you don't get all the video game references.  However if you do get the references the movie is totally hilarious!! So worth watching even if you don't have kids!
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|MUY BUEN PRODUCTO
B00000IQV6|5.0|This a a great, moving, true story of a down-to-earth medical student with a big heart and the right motives for becoming a doctor.  I hope every doctor watches this movie.
B004JVZXXU|5.0|Skipped 2 & watched 3 & 4 before it, it put the story together for me and it's got a pretty good jump factor
0446547654|5.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks' books, as they are all suspenseful page-turners and also love stories but not too mushy like a romance novel.  This one is another winner.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It really makes cruising pinterest a breeze.  It loads pretty quickly, and the layout is super-simple to use.  I also appreciate that you can &#34;share to&#34; the app and post from other apps.  One complaint though, it does sometimes select the wrong image even though I've tapped the one I want.
B0094JX07I|5.0|Amazing album all the way through. They keep getting better. If you don't like their first and second albums, you might not love it, but you'll still like it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I never knew about the &#34;Orphan Train Children&#34;  I found this book very interesting and informative.  It had a great story line, since I too am at the age of clearing out the clutter of my life. It also relates to the younger generations with the yourn girl.  I would recomend it to both old and young.
B008220D5K|1.0|The lady who played the wife in this movie was a nag through the whole movie. Even the oldest daughter was a total nag like the female lead.<br /><br />Paul Rudd rocked though.
B005LAIH2M|4.0|It was over the top. No plot to speak of. Blood, guts, and gore. That being said, I liked it! That could be because I went into to it expecting something realllyyy bad! I wanted it to be bad! I wanted something so bad that I could laugh at it! Every time the said Hansel's name I giggled! I watched too much looney tunes as a child! I'm really not sure why anyone would go into this expecting anything more than CGI, and gore. If you want a movie that is well crafted full of subtlety and understated acting please don't even consider this movie! However if you have  some time to waste and don't mind mindless diversion you might like this movie!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This game was one I was looking forward to, but it is just okay to me.  It is not at all what I was expecting from all the hype I had heard about it.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Depressing to think of living like that. Good book for book club because there is a lot of room for opinions and discussion.  Wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been  book club choice.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This is by far the best dictionary app around.  I am always looking up words, and this app is both useful and easy to use.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I like books where I learn about things I didn't know. It was a good story and well written.  I really felt for the main characters.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I use to love playing PAC MAN when I was a kid. I was looking forward to playing this on my Kindle Fire, but it is hard to do without a joystick.  It is still fun, but just a little hard to maneuver.
B00846REIS|1.0|For a series that's immensely sexual, book 1 is very anti climactic!  I chose this series after devouring Fifty Shades, and I do not need to keep reading.  There's practically no character descriptions and all 3 main characters lack depth.  It's pathetic really.  Don't waste your money.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have looked at other apps for the Bible but for me this one is the best one.  I really enjoy getting the daily verses and starting my day out on a positive note.
B00631VJIC|4.0|All of the tracks are great! The only thing missing are the familiar songs from some of the episodes that were recorded by other artists from other albums.
B002SAS26E|3.0|This game is very light on strategy and heavy on the turn of the cards.It's not my first choice when it's game time,but it's not a bad game either.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Awesome tv series James full of action drama and Dirty secrets that will keep you wanting more. Spartacus is an amazing series from season one blood and sand till the last season war of the damned.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I am 53 and have been looking for something new I heard a song from Lindsey Stirling on Pandora .<br />I went to my computer to see what it was and went wow I really like this so I bought 3 CD's<br />Lindsey Stirling , Bond , Escala , I think they are well worth the money.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Loved this Blake Sheldon CD.  He is<br /> going to go far with his sureness about who he is and his musical talents!
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is a very good collection that all Batman fans should own. Christopher Nolan and Tim Burton were the two best Batman directors. The cover is very cool and it is in a protective holographic slip-cover. I would recommend this to all DC Universe fans out there.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Ordered one for me and one as a gift.  After playing it over some time all her songs really reach out to you!
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I was immersed in this story. It went slow at first but once you get to it you get hooked. It's full of hope...... She had such a hard life yet remained true to be a good person. It made me think how much we take for granted. And through all her struggles (a lot internal)she finds true love. If you like romance novels read Jane Eyre! You will fall in love with her too.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|It was a very different story, I purchased the book because I liked the authors other book &#34; Dark Tide&#34;. I learned some interesting things about OCD. It was suspenseful . I felt sorry for the girl in the story with what happens too her. It wa sinteresting going back and forth with 4 years ago & then to date and back with what happened to her with this very controlling boyfriend. I dont usually read this type of book but it kept me wanting to read more.  I have ordered her 3rd book which is coming out soon.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|seems a bit flimsy, but has worked so far - I've scanned about 400 so far.  better than the ION which didn't work at all for me - though the hardware looks the same.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I'm showing this to my grandchildren and they love it too. It makes you think and my children talked thoughtfully about the story,  what it means and how it can make one appreciate what they have. It was also an example of the beauty that can be found in nature.
B0067R0APK|5.0|This app has lots of great info and then some. I also like the fact that it gives you daily and hourly reports.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Sorry Tony Kushner! Angels in America IS brilliant...but this is dull dull dull...and D Day Lewis's &#34;Lincoln Voice&#34; is annoying and nasally. I like my Lincoln with a deep voice.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Have these guys been following me around work for the last five years? Or perhaps the struggles of my IT org are not unique after all. I was initially skeptical of the novel form, it very clearly outlines the real problems that real shops face today, and offers equally real solutions in a practical setting and in a digestible form.<br /><br />If you're even thinking about terms like ITIL, DevOps, Lean and Agile, ditch the giant binders that talk about Service Delivery in a vacuum and read this book instead.
B009X011UQ|5.0|This was my first case I ordered for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I read the reviews and also took the price in consideration. It's perfect the fit , the weight, and I love the color Purple, I'm usually a black or gray person, but this is a awesome Mattie metallic purple. I'm so glad I stepped out of the box. I'm very proud of my purchase, and thank you Amazon I love your Prime program, it's worth every dollar. The only thing I wish was different was the amount of books you get to read from the lending library each month!!!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|So far looks like a great series.  It's a good action adventure series yet has some good acting also.  Try it and see if you like it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The Martian<br />Fast pace, hard to put down.<br />Very funny in places, enjoyed it a lot.<br />Will keep and read again.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great app. for y'all whose kindle is freezing that's a problem with amazon... I had to get a new kindle because of that. it also happens when u don't have a wifi connection
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was awesome. I read it for ar points for school and it was so good I finished it in about an hour.  I recommend this book to young readers that love comedy, page turners, and suspense.<br /><br />  THANK YOU
0807014273|5.0|Penomenal book about Frankl's experiences during the war and about how his theoretical perspective was formulated through observing human nature amidst incredible conditions.  One of the &#34;must have&#34; books for a worthwhile library.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I have always loved the pc version and when i decided to get it on my Kindle Fire I was not dissapointed. Less lag, exclusive stuff, I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you are looking for a cute free pet game then this is for you. I love how u can get other horses and clothes for your ride. Also I like  how the training for your horse is a mini game.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|So I really only got in to KE after their first singer left. Howard brought the band to a whole new level, so when he left I was a little apprehensive when it was Leach returning. After listening to the special edition all fears were put away. Leach does an amazing job picking up where Howard left off while also making his own mark. This is another great album from KE. Anyone who loves metal will want to pick this album up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved every step and looking forward to more. Has a great balance of twists and the prose is perfect. Makes me love reading again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is really great. I downloaded it for my kindle for when I had some spare time but now I'm having a hard time putting it down!! :)
B0037SQ3C6|3.0|Since the Nocturnes have such a prestigious reputation, it must have been something of a daunting decision for a young man in his twenties to attempt recording all of them. The question, then, is whether Yundi's interpretations measure up to the recorded work of older, more-established artists like Arthur Rubinstein, Ivan Moravec, Claudio Arrau, Earl Wild, Tamas Vasary, Daniel Barenboim, Maria-Joao Pires, or, more recently, Maurizio Pollini. To put it definitively, yes. And no. Well, maybe.<br /><br />Yundi exhibits dazzling skill, with a light touch when needed (which is frequently) and a sure hand always. Moreover, his speeds are consistently relaxed, which helps to reinforce the music's dreamy, melancholy, elegiac moods. However, foremost in the Nocturnes the pianist needs to communicate heart, and it is here that a comparison to Pollini's DG set finds Yundi coming up a bit short. While I admired Yundi's virtuosity, the playing did not always move me as Pollini's so often does. Still, this is a highly subjective reaction, and another listener might find Yundi's renditions even more compassionate, meditative, and soulful for their deliberate pacing and frequently sentimental nuances.<br /><br />John J. Puccio<br />Classical Candor
B005MLOKXA|4.0|See my review of Season 1, titled &#34;Chicago politics ...&#34; All the characters from the first season are back, as well as some interesting new additions.  The law office politics intensifies.  Some story lines that previously seemed to be separate turn out to be interconnected. Some epic double-crosses and backstabbings take place.  If you've seen Season 1 and liked it, you'll like this.  Don't try to watch this one without watching Season 1 first, though, or you won't have a clue as to why various people are doing what they're doing to each other.
B0061QD88S|4.0|It's Lady and the Tramp.  What's not to like.  This Disney Classic does not fail or disappoint the viewer.<br /><br />IL Grandma
B00B9LNLTQ|4.0|This is my favorite album from the 80's...oh wait it's 2013.  The Strokes summon their inner 1980s (even early 90s)  and have created a great album.  I hear so many influences - Michael Jackson, Beck and many more.  I highly recommend this album.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Movie was great and deserved its awards.  Ben Affleck deserved best director award.  Movie was compelling and very moving.<br />IL Grandma
0525953728|5.0|Great book chronicling fun events. I would highly recommend this book, despite any controversy surrounding it. I wouldnt believe what the government says anyway!
B007REV4YI|4.0|I'm a &#34;Bond&#34; junkie and Skyfall did not disappoint.  Good acting, good story, some twists and turns that were also unaccepted.  We really enjoyed the film.<br />IL Grandma
B000002LEM|5.0|Van Halen's 1988 release the second album of Van Halen with Sammy on lead vocal, is really an excellent album and takes the great balance with pop and heavy materials and even heavier tracks sounds really upbeat and uplifting and Sammy's souring voice adds to that appeal.<br /><br />The album produced four hits such as BLACK AND BLUE #34, WHEN IT'S LOVE #5, FINISH WHAT YA STARTED #13, and FEELS SO GOOD #35 on Billboard Hot 100 chart. Among them I love WHEN IT'S LOVE and FEELS SO GOOD. Particularly Feels so good has addictive appeal and remains to be one of my all-time favorite late 80s songs.<br /><br />Rock tracks are shining with their own rights. Particularly I love CABO WAVO which is one of my top favorite rock tracks of VH. SUCKER In A 3 PIECE is one of the heaviest tracks of this album but it still has \\"feel-good\\" beat in it and my favorite track as well. The only song I don't feel for so well is the last track A APOLITICAL BLUES, it is not bad for blues rock track but to me it is purely for Dave material.<br /><br />Verdict: One of the finest time of Sammy-era Van Halen<br />Rating: 91 out of 100<br />Recommended for late 80s pop rock fans.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|I preferred the live theater version.  I especially felt that Anne Hathaway's role was much over-rated because of the short time her character was in the movie.  Hugh Jackman was great!<br /><br />Theater Lover
B0089LOG02|5.0|Being a great fan of human interest stories, the Orphan train hit the spot! Its portrayal of human suffering and the occasional glimpse of human compassion and love blend for a 'can't put it down' kind if book!
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|Hard to believe this movie came out in 1997, but watching in HD made it even better than the original!!
B00BHNQ5XK|1.0|What a joke for a horror movie! My husband and I LOVE Horror movies and this one was unbelievably dumb!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A Good book, with a twist. Page turner, although a little slow toward the end. But picks back up. Definitely worth reading!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This was a personal insight into the minds of a skilled sniper.  Well written and enlightening.  This was a Good read
B001DM1VXE|1.0|Other than good acting ... it pretty much stunk... slow developing and boring,<br /><br /> bad cinematography, boring plot, questionable ending and lack of knowledge of science and God.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an interesting novel.  It told the story from both the German as well as the American side of the war.  Its amazing how parallel the two tales became.  Intesting novel.  Good read.
B00271HAK8|5.0|Ferris Bueller is one of the best comedies from the 1980s. Overall, it has a lot of laughs and should bring back many memories for all those who lived in the 80s or have seen it before. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie definitely should see it. It's worth watching.
B0091REZMW|5.0|its great you get to kill monsters and go in to games that are like ispy. and you get items to charge collections and get chargers and so much more its awsome
B00A0SMTXS|3.0|Its ok I was mistaken when I bought this movie but still like it. It has great special effects and good story line. I just liked the original movie with Arnold.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What did we expect?...this is such an amazing movie.<br />Everyone in our family loves the Lord of the Ring books, and the movies...this is a great addition to our collection!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|JUST WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU'VE READ ALL SORTS OF BOOKS, THEN YOU COAME UPON THIS BRILLIANT PIECE OF WORK
B004EPYZZI|4.0|Very good true story and a definet must see for everyone.  Some of the characters acting isn't perfect but still this whole movie and story is a must see!
B00555X8OA|5.0|Haven't read a better book in the past 2 years. Absolutely mind-blowing information and thought provoking concepts on basically every single page.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I am always amazed by the directors' ability at condensing and reducing to its essentials a masterful epic (George R.R. Martin is one of the great writers of this era; he has understood the feudal world better than many historians). The casting is perfect, the actors correspond almost exactly to what you imagined reading the books. Some unnecessary additions in relation to the printed text.
B005HSL626|5.0|First off of my review I'm going to say, &quot; halfbrick did an awesome job on this app, I spend hours of my time playing this app,  each time increasing my score, which isn't very easy if you know what I mean.&quot; This app is for everyone, those who can and cannot read. No, spelling required either, which is great for your younger gamers. So, I recommend this app at all costs, both free and nonfree. So, buy it now!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I down loaded the original app let me tell u since the update. I would call this app the best free weather app. out there. no question about it.
B0006AAS5G|3.0|Originally I bought it for my self, but out of the box it just doesn't look like something a guy should wear.<br />The watch looks great on a woman's wrist. So guess what? It became a gift to my gf the same day I recieved it!
B00BLDD3A4|5.0|First I have to admit that I am a huge fan of Dave Grohl and he so far can do no wrong so I maybe a little biased as a reviewer. I would suggest seeing the film first and then buy the music. The collaborations are just stellar.
B008HFWF3U|5.0|The first Orchestrion cd was before the tour.  Not that there was anything wrong with that music, but it's obvious on this cd that Pat became comfortable with the Orchestrion as an instrument.  The music seems less arranged and more spontaneous.  The solos are better and he develops them more deeply with the tunes themselves.<br /><br />Occasionally, you will see Pat's music in the &#34;light jazz&#34; bins.  I can understand that, because I think much of Pat's music is more accessible to the masses, but it's also pleasing to those folks who are looking for excellent compositions, great depth of development in the music and of course excellent musicianship.  All this combined with a great sound on all the instruments and an artistic investment of himself into the music, makes all of Pat's music excellent.<br /><br />I'm sure that some people viewed this instrument of Pat's as a novelty.  In someone else's hands perhaps, but no so here, and the additiion of some tunes that were not originally written for the Orchestrion is wonderful.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|This is a great set of songs by a great band. Love the energy and mix of sounds from these guys. One of my favorite bands.
0061537969|5.0|Excellent book. This book is filled with warmth and compassion for the life we must live.  If you have a friend thatr enjoys his or her pet, they will enjoy this book.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great story line with as always, terrific characters whom are well developed, interesting and most importantly, humanly flawed.  Making for an excellent and enjoyable read.
B00005JN0T|5.0|One of Will Smith's best movies,read the book in high school ,well acted, lots of action, engaging plot,all in all a well crafted movie.
B000RVK1AQ|5.0|that i had to spend very little to get it. i love the prime videos. it will alway be there when i want to watch it.
B00064AM6C|5.0|love music and dvds.  white stripes is great only wish they had more music out and music dvds that were not documentaries.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|i bought this movie because we're huge LOTR fans. it is a very long movie. for me it kinda drags out but you learn a lot about what happens before frodo. the fist time i saw this was in the movie theater. i glad i got to watch it again. i will be getting the rest of them on the instant movies so i can enjoy the at home.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for people who love mob movies like myself. For someone who grew up in a similar situation ,it was like watching home movies of my neighborhood in Philly. I can remember a line when they were at the race track about the War in Vietnam and the Hippies at that time. We had no such people on my street, we all looked like C and his buddies. What a time.
B00197POXG|5.0|i kepted trying to watch the series on youtube, because some people put up the whole show.. then they would get canceled because of copyright issues. so i said i was done w/ all that.  so  i went and  bought it.. i was really glad to find out it did came w/ the 2 movies they after the show was completed. so there was no need to buy the extra movies that they suggested me to get.. come to find out that my son of 12 yr old love this show to.. we like to watch it together. it makes for good family talks about  the history that happened in the show as well as real life. . all in all if u r looking for a good wholesome family show u need to get this. it is well worth the money. there is another plus to this as well there is wholesome romance as well.. the packaging looks like real leather but the inside where the movies are is very delicate.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I love this book and hope to get my teenagers to read it. Easy to read and a real page turner.
B00AYB0SX4|3.0|Would not rent it again.  East of my money. tired of typing a must have amount of words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  this bites
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|So funny. So true. Loved the characters!! Loved renting on amazon. Easy to watch. You get the movie for 48 hours which is a must  easy to stop and go back to watch. Very happy camper.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Each season gets better and better.  Still love the show. I cant wait for the next season.  The men just keep getting hotter and hotter as well.  A plus all around!!
B005PK57IK|5.0|The characters are believable, easy to relate to, and have heart and soul. The stories are great, the good guys don't always win, and fun to watch.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Some pretty good character acting, but the script is messy. Pretty much a violent day fantasy trip, not much else to say. Sam Jackson is, of course, hilarious.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Great story that comes full circle.  I like the way the story goes back and forth between present day and the young women's childhood.  Would be a great book club read.
B00BF11STU|5.0|KHALID.... KHALID....KHALID... KHALID... KHAAALLLLIIIIDDDDD *bang*<br />OSAMA.... OSAMA.... OSAAAMMMAAAA *bang*<br /><br />~Operators Gonna Operate~<br /><br />No, seriously, this movie is legit, you should watch it.
1423140605|5.0|My emotions are seriously tangled right now. I loved this book, but it ended with an enormous cliff-hanger that is kind of killing me! I need the House of Hades ASAP!<br /><br />*deep breath. in out, in out.\\"<br /><br />This book picks up right where the Son of Neptune left off, Jason, Piper, Leo and Annabeth are arriving at New Rome and the story jumps right in, but at the same time, the story seamlessly weaves in enough background to help you pick the story right back up. Its been quite a while since I read the Son of Neptune, so the review was helpful.<br /><br />This book covers a lot of storylines and myths, but it never felt overwhelming. The suspense kept me flipping pages, and I was mad whenever I would have something come up that would force me to put it down.<br /><br />I don't really want to go into too much detail about the story because I feel like anything would be spoilery, just know that this is a must-read for Percy Jackson/Heroes of Olympus fans.
B0054W4JQK|2.0|Each chapter repeats the last to the point where the story line is lost in tedium. I understand the need to draw the reader into Christine's daily life, but just too much!

B001BPJJ9G|5.0|We saw this movie once, and decided we had to own it. Enter Amazon- great price! Glorious story- and filmed all over the world. I recall such vivid colors, and the acting is great. Love Lee Pace!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie is amazingly hilarious. Fat Amy is a brilliant character. My significant other even enjoyed it as much as I did.
034544678X|4.0|This was a very enjoyable book.  Our dogs are very smart and easy to train,  but it was good to look at them from their point of view rather than ours.  They don't think they are disgusting when they roll in dead things,  they are in heaven.  Gotta get used to that concept.
B001AEF6BI|5.0|This movie is a clasic. If you have not seen it, it is a must see. It truly is a great movie.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far this game has been fun.  Right now it seems a bit slow but is keeping my interest...  no install or performance issues.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Watched the mini tv series before reading book. The book was better. Enough excitement to keep any stretch from drawing out. Store made it hard to put book down, very enjoyable!!!

1616551151|5.0|I just recieved Dragon Age The World of Thedas from Amazon today.  It's large and Impressive.  I haven't read it yet but I flipped through it a little.  The fowards by David Gaider and Mike Laidlaw were not that big a deal.  I'd heard differently on a review site, ha,ha.  The map of Thedas is impressive in a double page layout.  What's most interesting so far is places where we haven't visited.  A lot of the book of course seems familar from the games but I'm pretty sure there will be tidbits of interest.  I'm not sure it's worth full price of $39.99 but at the amazon price of 20 something it's a good deal in my opinion.  Overall Gorgeous!  It ends too quickly.
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is pretty cool it's a lot like wow which is pretty awesome since I got burnt out on wow like three years ago.......lol<br />It's definitely a breath of fresh air
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|If you have ever played any on the Bloons tower defence online or on mobile, get this one now!!! For only 2.99 you get hours of entertainment and fun. Get new towers like the heli pilot or the engineer workshop, new special agents like the Radadactyl, and the monkey lab. I swear you won't regret it after you buy it.
B004XN3FHA|1.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3G1JPMARW3LDZ]]After a month, my Fenix TK41's power switch stopped responding. I believe Fenix makes some great products, but not very reliable. I  returned this light.
081299471X|5.0|would totally recommend this book to anyone !!! Read the book and go watch the movie ! it's worth the time !
044024367X|2.0|This book got silly. It meanders back and forth, became very tiresome to read. It starts out fine, but then settles into a trip from one town to another town, back to the first town, back to the other town and on and on. There's nothing to grab the reader and when I stopped caring I knew this was not a winner.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|great movie and i love it. i would totally recommend this movie to anyone, so they can learn sarcasm and see the lives of people who are 'social outcasts'
8866137626|2.0|Like other reviewers, I had the same disappointment on receiving my notebook.  I wish I had waited for reviews.<br /><br />I was expecting more 'magic' and integration -- something special about this notebook, but found none other than the included 3mo subscription code.  I thought maybe my (Android) app wasn't set up correctly, but no.. it's just pictures of paper, like any other.  No automatic alignment, no grid removal, nothing really.  Apparently the stickers are only for iOS?<br /><br />Fits well in a back pocket, very nice cover, and good quality paper.  It's a nice notebook, but I imagine $20 buys other nice notebooks too.<br /><br />The pages are quite small, so I find I write close to the binding.  Then you have the challenge of holding it fully open while taking an awkward one-handed picture with Evernote's page camera.  Orientation, finger obfuscation, and focus are all the same as any cheap notebook.<br /><br />I'd love to see something more like Livescribe, where Evernote has special orientation marks (angle correction) or selection boxes on each page.  A lay-flat binding would be nice for something you're expected to photograph.<br /><br />If you're not already a subscriber, the 3mo trial is probably the biggest incentive to buy this over another notebook.  Sure feels like a great opportunity missed, though -- Evernote and Moleskin.  Could have been more.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|cool story and you will laugh throughout  the movie, the new mean girls of the decade. would recommend to watch
B00947N6UG|5.0|We enjoy this movie. Might be a little scary  for really Little Ones. The Boogyman can give a little fright.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|nice story for anyone to watch, makes you double think on your life. awesome movie effects and would recommend this to anyone!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing book. Now one of my top five favorite books. Second book in the Enders series was a let down though...
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This movie is awesome and a great come back. The soundtrack is awesome (DAFT PUNK) and i only regret not buying the soundtrack with the movie !
B009R659L8|5.0|I loved this book, it keep you guessing as to what was going on. I figured it out when I was in the last chapter. It is well worrth the money to purchase this book. Mary Higgins Clark is one of the best.
1595828753|2.0|gene yang destroyed avatar. he omg i cant even he destroyed it! destroyed it. dont even read this and keep on moving on with your life. this ranks on the same level as the last airbender (movie)
0425252868|5.0|Absolutely one of the  best books I have ever read  The previous history-the facts - the follow -ups  make it the tops and a read for everyone. From realism to actualisation is a must read for anyone.<br />Enjoy - it is one of the best.<br />Don Vollmer / Denver CO
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I loved this film because it shows how life is and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to 'experience' live !
B000H6SXMY|1.0|I usually pay a lot of attention to consumer reviews, but for some reason, this time I did not. Lesson learned. Don't buy this set. I have had nothing but problems including: episodes that freeze, episodes that play only a brief segment then returns to the main menu, multiple disks that will not play episodes. I tested them on multiple DVD players with the same Results. Extremely disappointed.
B002ZG981E|5.0|awesome movie and story. would definitely recommend (force) someone to watch this movie. makes your mind blow into pieces. epic
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is beautifully written and I appreciate the energy and the action.<br />I hated the cliff hanger ending because I read the first three within a week and now I have to wait until the fourth is published.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, it's just so good.<br />Rick Riordan is the newest member of my favorite authors.<br /><br />What a good read.<br />Buy it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|awesome trilogy, the first movie is ok... but the 2nd and 3th film i recommend everyone to watch! they are awesome
B004EPZ08E|5.0|This movie is fantastic! I am a huge fan of Always Sunny in Philadelphia, so Charlie Day intrigued me in this film. This movie is hilarious and will keep you interested the whole time. Kevin Spacey is also great in this, along with Colin Ferrel.
B006H5120E|5.0|Would watch this movie a 1000 times ! so romantic. With the 3D it gives the movie a whole new touch and i like it!
B004UPANGM|4.0|Loved it. Special effects are excellent for this kind of movie and the acting......wonderful. If you are into campy horror flicks this is for you.
B00A83075M|5.0|My Son loved the gift, its a great value for the price. Will definitely look for these types of deals going forward.
B00C4QMHK4|3.0|I remember this movie when I was younger and loved it. Watching it now I still like the arm wrestling scenes but could do without the rest.
B003KJF2WE|5.0|It was easily downloaded the movie was very enjoyable would love to own this movie in the future. highly recommend it
B00BCZU8WM|3.0|Songs are long. Style is all over the place. I like about 30% of the songs. I respect the artistic expression, but most of these are only good to listen to when you're talking loudly with a group of friends (AKA, you can't hear it)<br /><br />Pusher Love Girl: catchy chorus, verses are strange: JT's an addict... for love.<br />Suit and Tie: Jay Z's part makes the song. Mostly enjoyable<br />Don't Hold the Wall: 1st impression: WTF. Warmed up to it later, still not that great.<br />Strawberry Bubblegum: Pointless. The accompaniment is not good enough to make up for the banal theme of this song (Where's Ryan Lewis when you need him?)<br />Tunnel Vision: Better than &#34;Don't Hold the Wall,&#34; still kind of lost, long and drawn out.<br />Spaceship Coupe: I don't think I've even made it through the whole song... It's 7 minutes long.<br />That Girl: Maybe good if you're lying next to the pool on a sunny day? Sweet and chill<br />Let the Groove Get In: This one is actually awesome. Upbeat, VERY different than all the other tracks. Enjoyed it.<br />Mirrors: The main reason to buy this album. This one is long (8 min), but he successfully made use of the time and made the whole song interesting and enjoyable.<br />Blue Ocean Floor: Ready for a curve ball? JT seems to be channeling Imogen Heap or something. It's a good track, but doesn't fit with anything else on the album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|could u please put it so u can switch it over from creative to surviveal but I stile love the game
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey. I have to admit that I was a little surprised.  Maybe I should have read some of the reviews first.  That's OK, though.  It was a good book.
B007IK44CK|3.0|Wouldn't be considered my favorite of all the MI movies but good in its own way.  You have the free time watch it.
B007VWEEQQ|5.0|not much else i can say. i've had it for a few months.<br /><br />despite being generic, it fits well and offers perfect clarity.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Froze during playing multiple times-- rented movie to watch from Uverse! Is it possible to get a refund--too disappointed to pursue at the time!
0062059963|5.0|This book is the second installment in the selection trilogy.  I loved reading the first book in the series [[ASIN:0062059947 The Selection]] and couldn't put it down, I was instantly hooked.  I have seen many other reviews that said the this second book wasn't worth the money because it didn't have much action or suspense, and had a predictable plot line.  I however, like this book and although sometimes predictable found that it still kept me, as a reader, engaged and wanting to read more.  Of course I wanted more and was disappointed when I got to the end, because you find you're self saying 'finally America you've come to your senses', and predictably that's where the book ends.  I believe that Cass did a great job exploring characters, and developing their personalities further in this book.  All in all I would say this is a typical second book for a trilogy, because it doesn't necessarily have a lot of action, but is used to help you better understanding of the characters' traits and their flaws, and along with that it gives you enough background and plot development to set readers up for the final instillation in the trilogy.  I can't wait to see what book three holds for America, Maxon, and the rest of the characters in the final book. *FanGirl moment Team Maxon all the way*
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|To preface - I'm a keyboard person.  If I had my way, everything would be navigable with keyboard shortcuts.<br /><br />I'm also a fan of plain and simple things, which is to say a standard 105 key (or so) keyboard without media buttons and other assorted shenanigans.<br /><br />That's quite a bit of a disclaimer there.  There's more yet, actually, but I guess it sort of transitions into the actual body of the review, if this can be considered a review at all.  Feels more like a blog post now.<br /><br />Anyway - I'm moving from a Logitech G5 - the poor scrollwheel has finally gone left the cuckoo nest, and I don't particularly want to take it apart.  It has served a good number of years.<br /><br />Let's start with the shinies of the Anker mouse:<br />  * Driver software is up the walls with customisability.  You've got your assorted actual key mappings, and then key macros to boot, as well as media/system/OS control stuff, too!  It lacks the actual &#34;Mouse&#34; buttons in neat labels, though.  I'll list them here because I can:<br />Mouse button -  - Anker Name<br />Mouse Button 1 - (left) Click<br />Mouse Button 2 - Right Click<br />Mouse Button 3 - Middle Button<br />Mouse Button 4 - Backward<br />Mouse Button 5 - Forward<br />annnd that's all I could find.  There might very well be more, and other reviews might have the complete list, but alas I've already started typing mine and nothing can stop me now!<br />  * Weights are lightweight, so the weight of the mouse is more fine-tuneable.  Though, if there's a preference for a heavy mouse, then there's no joy - even with all the weights attached, it still doesn't feel quite the same as my old G5 with +6.8g to the mouse weight.<br />  * Plenty of buttons, more than enough for me to macro up.<br /><br />There are a few things I'd like to see different, though:<br />  * Ergonomics of the mouse, though this is probably my being accustomed to the feel of my old mousey.<br />  * Thumb area texture: it feels too slick, and the spacing is too large to offer any actual grip.  Again, I really like how the G5's thumb and ring finger/pinky area texture felt, like a fine, rubbery sandpaper.<br />  * Slim down the thumb buttons: they feel too jutting out and press in quite a bit (for a thumb button, in my opinion).<br /><br />Otherwise, really slick mouse.  I've used it for all of 5 minutes, so take everything said here with a block of salt.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I never knew this musical well until I saw the movie, with which I fell in love. I enjoy hearing the live singing and highly recommend it. I also love the feature where it streams to all my computers and my iPhone. Phenomenal!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This BINGO game is fantastic.  One of the best games.  I play on my kindle fire and only wish the updates to the game would come at the same time since I am an elite customer.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good game. My son loves it. Its easy to use and simple enough for small children. He likes destroying and building.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I expect no less than to be completely drawn into the story and this book does just that. Hate for it to end but there is always book number five.....
B007REV4YI|5.0|What a great film!!! - I cannot understand how people dislike Daniel Craig as 007. Perfect man for the part, in my opinion. This is an action packed movie, that is fun to watch, as one might expect from a James Bond movie. Excellent casting choices make this one of my favorite Bond films.
B00B1OWEX0|4.0|while comparisons to his work with Nine Inch Nails often paint this side project in an unfavorable light, i found that there are a lot of similarities that build on his albums &#34;Year Zero&#34; and &#34;Ghosts I-IV&#34;. De-tuned instruments, variations in noise and frequencies each build into cohesive song structures that are both instantly familiar and altogether alien to the listener. off-tempo acoustics layered over exacting electronic beats and progressions often work very well with his wife's vocal talents, but it seems that she sometimes gets lost when Trent joins on back-up vocals or in a chanted chorus. This album helps showcase a different musical perspective of Trent Reznor that the audience only sometimes previously glimpsed in the more delicate moments of Nine Inch Nails' history.
B005LAII8K|5.0|An excellent movie. Great actors. Good action. Interesting story. Yeah. It's great. Here's what you need to do: Buy, then watch.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Missed it when it aired. a good way to see the segment with out a big search. would use this way again for missed episodes
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am a fan of Depeche Mode and find it difficult to find fault with this band. Needless to say it was nice to see new material for 2013. I must admit, I found Sounds of the Universe (the prior release from 2009) to be a bit unusual and not what I had first expected. Delta Machine follows this pattern and evolves DM's sound a little bit further; however, still feels a bit like the material from an earlier recording session. Solid release with many great tracks, especially with the extra tracks included on the Deluxe Edition. Buy it. You'll be happy you did.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Everything Sophie Kinsella writes is terrific and this book is her at her best. it was funny, it was heartwarming and it was riveting from the first page to the last. As usual, the plot was clever and the ending uncertain, but she tied up all the strings in the most beautiful package! I finished with a sense of satisfaction and enjoyment, and the only bad thing is that I have to wait now until her next book comes out, which I will preorder the first chance I get. If you like Sophie Kinsella, or think her books would be fun to try, you will be very glad you read this one!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The first portion of the book spends quite a bit of time on pi's early life and religious background. I found it unnecessary to the shipwreck story, so I skipped ahead to the part where they are sailing to Canada.

Get another weather app don't waste time downloading and only getting the wrong weather:(
B008220D5K|1.0|I really wanted to like this movie but it was just plain boring. I now see all the bad reviews and I feel there pain. This movie is a waste of your time and money.

B0007MWZEK|2.0|I should have listened to the people that said that it would not hold a charge but above and beyond the battery life, this sweeper doesn't pick up simple things like little pieces of paper or lint.

0156012197|5.0|I truly enjoyed the perspectives of the characters.  It was a great reminder how our happiness and sense of duty are related to our values in life.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Liked it very much. Could identify with the lead person, a CIA female, who was persistent is her, and our search for bin Laden. Wherein the Bush people allowed bin Laden to escape from Northern Afghanistan, she pursued him to the location in Pakistan. Good for her!
1451696191|5.0|I loved this book.  I think it would really give confidence to young people who feel like they may not fit in with the cool crowd.  It glorifies the idea of individualism and pursuit of happiness in a way that is valid instead of what society tells us should make us happy.  I loved the way the main character thinks.  The book is written as a series of letters to an unknown recipient.  It is different in several big ways from the movie, but offers a more thorough understanding of the characters.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great App.  I Like How I Can Set Temperatures For Certain Activities That Are Pleasing And The App Tells Me If They Are Occurring Or Not.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is my favorite book and I was not disappointed with the film.  The producers even used additional references from the supplementary notes in the LOTR novels.  I can't wait for the rest of the trilogy!  As with any book-turned-movie, there were some minor differences, but it was a closer portrayal of the original.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|this is a great over it is clear so i can se the back cover that i got for my phone, and i like that its rubber i feel it will do better in a fall
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Memory loaded in my printer HP laser jet p2015 just fine.  It made spooling my print jobs a lot faster.
B00A4EDAN6|4.0|Ok, keeping things short... I've listened to Tegan and Sara for a while, never mind what I think is their best work, etc. If you are new to Tegan and Sara, this is as good place to start as any. Their production here is very similar to that of Sainthood (2009), but without the raw punk sound. This is more like Madonna than The Cure, but still very 80's. They keep trending towards more polished pop production, and I like that this album is bold and daring. Whereas people thought their last album was on the fence between new and old, this album doesn't leave much room to continue the trend unless they go towards trance or electronica, which I don't see happening.<br /><br />I can say that I never completely bought into the recording style of their earlier work. If you want something that sounds professional, revert back to So Jealous, The Con or even Sainthood. If its too loud, you're too old... This album is certainly aimed at the partying/clubbing crowd, and it is only truly enjoyable at fairly high volume!! For veteran fans on the fence, if Tegan and Sara made a dance record, this would be it. I am not one to debate the loudness trend of music. Others can debate if the production is too polished. I feel that this new album is catchy and traditional; well within Tegan and Sara's back-catalog of songwriting styles yet loud and in your face, polished, eager, aiming to please. C'mon people, this kind of music is supposed to be about fun. This is exactly what Tegan and Sara have delivered!!<br /><br />The best way I can describe the album is it seems to be very nearly sarcastic at times, honest and heartfelt at others; a concept album of raw emotion.... and I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />Bonus: The record is pricey but it comes with a CD copy... I am much more willing to pay more if I get a digital copy of verified quality. That way you can use what ever digital flavor and compression rate you like on your iPod, etc.. You don't have to accept the quality the record company wants you to have with their watermarked \\"download codes\\", or doubt the integrity of the FLAC rips that your friend \\"borrowed\\" from someone/somewhere...

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Provides a sweeping overview of the period leading up to WWII. She goes deep when necessary, with finely etched portraits of so many of the people involved, with their passions and commitments - who knows now that Wendall Wilkie was a great man and of great service to FDR and the country? Who knows now that FDR spent a lot of time dragging his feet and being indecisive about entering the war? So many people currently believe he was a duplicitous warmonger! The times are beautifully illuminated and so many important issues discussed.

The Velcro works great to keep the camera in; I've only a little problem with the snap on feature on the left side which sometimes snaps off by itself, causing the case to fall away from your camera and its strap and onto the ground.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was pretty disappointed with the ending of this book. The story kept me reading, and I finished it in just a couple days. Flynn's tone builds suspense. However, sometimes I felt like I was reading a slightly better James Patterson murder mystery. The ending was disappointing. I &#34;get&#34; why it ended that way, but it wasn't surprising. I would have preferred a different ending for sure.
B0027MJU00|5.0|A thriller til the very end! Dark, but a page turner! Don't read with the lights off! Gillian is a fabulous writer.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is the very best of Baladacci.  Moves fast and keeps tote edge of your seat.  EXCELLENT plot, surprise ending
B007RFDCQA|5.0|Who doesn't like Pretty in Pink!!!!???  It's all 80's!!!  I have already watched like 3 times since I downloaded and my teenage daughter loves it too!!!!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|wow, wonderful concept and terrific execution.  Wish I had known about this earlier.  The music is wonderful, makes me feel good every time I listen to it. I'm going to wear this out!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I was surprised, at first I did not think the show would appeal to me. The cast of characters, the storyline and tone of the show make it a nice little change from the prevalent futuristic/sci-fi/reality/police drama's that are on TV today.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|everyone has already read these books<br />its new and entertaining<br />it has reputation and some slow spots<br />in all fiction books its always too good to be true
B000LN7HUC|3.0|I was hoping the pot stand/wind screen would have been small enough to hold a space saver type cup that nestles with the 32oz Nalgene bottle I carry, but it does not.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|fiction is always too good to be true<br />some boring spots<br />some areas made me read faster<br />so it need to be evened out so not to fall asleep
B0073PPNE8|5.0|I really liked it, great acting and plot. Other people complain but they must be a bunch of Lilly livered sissies. Lol
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The calculator works  all the time when I need it for math/science anytime of day or night school or not.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Book one was good, book two I had to work through, but book three has rekindled my interest in the series and with fervor!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Incredible read! WOW, they should make a movie out of this! Great technical knowledge of the space program makes it a believable scenario. Well done.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|3 star rating because of the last pages which left me with a dissapointment, and the author's arrogance tough to take at times.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BB gets 5 stars I love this game it is very addictive works really well on kindle fire HD I would recommend BB to everyone who loves bingo best one out
B00AKFG15S|5.0|I loved this book as much as the 2 previous ones (Clifton Chronicles) and cannot wait for the fourth one to be published
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome because it has a lot of different  games that are so fun.some of the games r kind of hard
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|this game is really scary and fun but for the people who don't know anything about slender man u should look up a video or info on him
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is so awesome because you can go rescue the animals instead of buying them.it is really fun to.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I started hearing Creed when i was 8 yrs old and fell in Love with this band, not a heavy band but there music is just simply beautiful. I've had this album for years and never get tired of it, The songs are amazing.<br /><br />My Favorite song on this album is Higher, such a great song Scott's voice is Great.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good CD this is a perfect one. Every Creed fan has this album.<br /><br />Thank You Creed for this amazing Masterpiece.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|It's a great read - insightful and digestible. It's for women who have been in a constant battle with the gender entitlements that we inherit and carrying forward all the assumed assumptions the gender role brings.
B0000046ZJ|3.0|I do enjoy listening to the artist but this is not their best recording CD I heard or have. I have many Jazz recordings and I think this was recorded in mono.. I should check the back of the CD to stand correct.. If anyone knows about that I would appreciate it. :O)
B0002V7O3S|5.0|I was mesmerized by this move the first time I saw it many years ago.  You cannot catch it very often on any of the movie channels but I had been able to record it on a DVR several years ago.  I was so disappointed when my DVR went out and had to be replaced without anyway of saving this movie.  I was overjoyed to see that it was available on DVD and bought it immediately.  It will always be a movie that I enjoy.  I really don't know that I believe everything that happens in the movie that is based on a true story, but it is, and will always be, entertaining.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While the subject matter was disturbing (teenagers battling to the death, gladiator style for the entertainment of elite despots), this is a well crafted film, a fine example of the genre.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Safe Haven is an enjoyable book that is very easy to read.The plot is pretty predictable but it was still enjoyable
B008NB0SQO|5.0|My wife's Christmas tradition growing up was watching this movie on Christmas Eve.  We have since carried on the tradition and love it.  Michael Caine and the entire cast does a great job.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|EXCELLENT!  Was my first audio book because I was working on a quilting project...the time flew.  Now anticipate reading or listening to the second in series
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|I used to watch the show when I was younger and bought this movie on a whim without watching it first...glad I did.  My son loves the movie, mainly because it has pirates and a lot of adventure.  He runs around the house shouting &#34;Blistering Barnacles&#34;!
B0054SMIH6|3.0|The Michael Connelly book of the same name is much better.  If you are looking for good reads in the crime story genre you can't go wrong with any of Micheal Connelly's novels.  Recommend starting with his first Harry Bosch book, The Black Echo, as his characters entertwine.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Saw this movie twice in theaters with my son who loves it.  I'm no movie critic, but the movie I thought was very entertaining.  It does seem a little rushed at the end, but it's a kids movie and you can only hold their attention for so long.  The voice acting was great.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|We couldn't find our long-cherished DVD of Network, so my husband streamed it twice for his college Communication Ethics classes.
B001DTUU7A|5.0|Love the voice actors in the movie.  Really great movie and my son loves it.  Saw it in theaters and really enjoyed it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|great book. very good. lots of fun. fast quick easy read. more words are required 5 4 3 2 1 0
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Yeah, a lot of people say it's all about hippie/earth love, but the movie really does have a great story and theme.  Great music and voice acting.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I ordered my size, 7.5, since I have a pair of Tom's wedges and they are true-to-size.  However, the slip-on's were just a little too big.  I have pretty narrow feet that hover between 7 and 7.5, so I guess with flat slip-on's it's best to estimate low.  I just ordered a pair of 7's; hopefully they will be perfect!
B0060MYM7O|3.0|I know movies/series are rarely like the books, but come on...with 10 episodes you couldn't do things similar to the book?  It has some really good action, but some episodes are of characters that aren't even in the second book.  Rather than putting all the &#34;love story&#34; garbage, how bout you don't rush through everything else that was in the book.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Great read. I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for the third book coming out next year ( bummer );)
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Wife loves this movie.  We've watched it every Christmas since we've been married.  Great movie to quote and great story.  Jim Carey does an amazing job.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book is a wild adventure I would have loved to achieve when I was younger.  I'm too old now!!!!
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I think this one follows the book a little closer than the other seasons, but it does have a lot of the HBO requirement of nudity and nonsense.  Lots of action.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a great book.  I am normally a wall flower at meetings, and I was happy that way.  Yet I wondered why I cannot get ahead in either my work or my hobbies.  Although I work in a very female environment, I am determined to &#34;sit at the table&#34; from now on.  The book is applicable to many areas of life and to both the single woman with no kids and married women with four (and everything in between, and to the married men).
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|Great wrap up to Firefly.  The movie is awesome with lots of action.  Great cast and effects.  Would highly recommend.
B005VPRF9I|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my 7 year old nephew at his mom's recommendation and he absolutely loved it and did not stop playing with it for the entire time of his visit. Definitely recommend buying.
B004LWZWC4|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie and it really gets me motivated to go out and watch birds.  It's very relaxing.  The movie isn't a non-stop comedy, but the actors do a great job.  The settings that the scenes are in are fantastic.  Great movie.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Why this wasn't nominated for the Oscars foreign film is beyond me.... Fresh, funny, great acting, true story! And nobody dies!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I really enjoy these books and the TV series.  Books are definitely better, packed full of action.  The only real complaint is the way that the book chapters are labeled.  The chapters are named after the character that your &#34;seeing&#34; the story through, but when you go to the table of contents the chapters are numbered...bookmark often and don't lose your spot.  I do like having the actual book, but it is nice to have four books on my iPad.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I couldn't keep this book down. It brought back memories of sleepless nights I have spent on similar Phoenix projects.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a wonderful minecraft game where you can either play on survival mode or creative. You can also play multiplayer. The only thing do not like is that when you playing multiplayer you can't type for all I know, but I also hate that you can't change the skin. If this game could get any better they would update it so it has that. If this helped please tap yes. Thank you.
0143120530|2.0|I found this book to be a major disappointment. It's subtitle is 'the art and science of remembering everything'. There was neither art nor science in this book. It was merely this journalist talking about his experience learning how to memorize and peppered with an occasional insight. I felt let down because I wanted to learn more about memorizing since I have returned to school as a mature student and want to do well in my courses. This book was lame
B004U40NBS|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie even after all the hype, but it lived up to everything and more, a must see movie if you haven't seen it.
B000G759LW|4.0|I think if you love show tunes, this is a great CD for you. I enjoy this album, its a throwback with snappy tunes, sassy sing alongs and Christina's voice is as always a powerhouse and its apparent she can sing beyond a pop song...remember \\"Ginnie in a bottle\\"...?? I find this two-disc CD set enjoyable and a more mature album she has produced. To add.. it reminds me of the era of big band music.. jazzy catchy show tunes of back of the days of B. Holiday...but with a new modern day vibe twist thrown in. Sorry..a twisted description if you will..lol. A few of the songs are commercial..like candy man, for example. I enjoyed this CD.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Big Ben sure loves to have big screen shots of his face.....but all in all it was the best movie of the year
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was not my favorite Stephen King book, but it was very good.  If you like the idea of time travel you will probably like this story.  Stephen King is &#34;out there&#34; so you have to take that into consideration.  I liked his story development I could not put it down I just had to find out what happened next.
B001UGB1X8|2.0|We didn't think this movie was typical of Tommy Lee Jones usual quality of movie.  It never really addressed the murder of the young woman that opened the movie, we could only assume that the sheriff who killed the slave and kidnapped Jones' daughter also killed the young woman..........
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I got this for my 6 yr old grandson while he was visiting.  He really enjoyed it. I personally never played it.
B008J05EL8|1.0|Don't buy this app.  It doesn't work!  Read all the other reviews before you decide to purchase this terrible app.  What a rip-off!
B005LJITS0|4.0|A definite thumbs up and I cannot wait for the sequel. This movie was both humorous and engaging. I would recommend this to all my friends to watch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The little girl I babysit loves this game. She would play for hours if I let her. Highly recommend this game for everyone :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is asome I love it it so fun it so cool that you can go to city's I wounded where we go next
B007X4ECMI|1.0|First, they shoot the Asian-looking character. Then they kill the black man. The villain is, of course, European. Finally, the blonde is saved by the muscle man, who cannot act. His abs auditioned for the part. Peter Stormare is, as usual, majestic and believably sinister--the only redeeming part. They should have added some aliens. Real aliens, with tentacles! Stupidly formulaic movie, except for Peter Stormare. The ending is so yucky: &#34;For a minute there, I thought you were going to kiss me,&#34; quipped the hero to the beautiful blonde.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was one of my fastest reads. The plot was great with one twist after another.  The characters had depth and believability.  A great read.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Saw it in the theater, and purchased the blu-ray so I can re-watch it at my leisure.  In my opinion, the movie is a masterpiece, capturing Lincoln's struggle  and his brilliant and relentless political skills in his effort to see the 13th amendment pass congress before the end of the civil war.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Omg!! I can't get enough of this show I'm so addicted.. I watch it in my dreams.. I've grown 2 luv the characters & when one dies I feel like I'm right there.. This show always has me on edge & I'm waiting till the next season fall 2013!!! Hurry plz!!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I love, love this book!!  Its always been one of my favorites.  I plan to have my daughter read it next!!!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a must see movie. It has so much real raw feeling, anyone would love it. Iv seen it multiple times in theaters and when I saw it for sale I jumped at the chance to own it myself!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Cassandra Clare is a wonderful writer. I think the problem with these negative reviews are their bias and them not understanding the fact that this is only the first book. Most series start with the first book which explains what the story is about, in this case, the world of Shadowhunters and Downworlders. So inevitably, there will be long passages that are simply just explanations.<br />  If you do however decide to look past the bias opinions of incredibly tough book critics, then you will find this to be not only a very refreshing book, but book series as well. Cassandra Clare adds a humorous and realistic twist to fairy tales and myths that have been passed down from generation to generation. \\"All the stories are true\\" couldn't explain the premise of this book any better.<br />  Overall, this is not some predictable story. Look past your doubts and think to when you were young and imagined that wizards and mermaids and faries were all real. Don't let the toxins of the world get in the way of your imagination. Give this book a try and be immersed in the world of the Shadowhunters.
0938045768|4.0|This is a great book explaining the benefits of bodyweight training. The choice of 6 basic exercises is also good, and they make sure you have a balanced workout.<br /><br />The major flaw is in the progressions the author lays down for each of the 6 exercises. There are four exercises where, at a certain point, you need to switch from two-sided to a one-sided variation. This is too big a transition; I have not been able to make them, and from what I read on the internet, I am not the only one. I used the webaites by Al Kavadlo and beastskills.com for better instructions on these progressions.<br /><br />Another omission is that you will lack flexibility for a number of these progressions (especially the pistol squat and bridge), and the authors tends to neglect hat. More attention to that in the description of the progressions would have been helpful.<br /><br />But, as a motivational guide to bodyweight training, this is still a great book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It was absolutely intriguing. The story line, the scenery, and the costumes. As each episode ended it left you begging for more. Not to be missed.
B000FA675C|5.0|I'm not a big fan of religious novels which  thought this book would be, but I was wrong.  I totally enjoyed the book.  It's thriller aspect more than made up for the religious undertones and its Vatican setting.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I highly recommend the Mitch Rapp books. Vince Flynn keeps his protagonist involved so the reader is never bored. These books would make great movies with Gerard Butler in the title role.
B00957T6X6|5.0|My son told me about this series of books.  I ordered the preview and could not stop reading. I purchased the five book bundle.  I love this series as it hooks you at the beginning.  George Martin paints such a vivid picture that you see the story as a movie in your mind.  Vivid descriptions which hook you, draw you into the lives of the characters in the book.  Absolutely fantastic, I wish I had discovered this series years ago.  My new favorite author.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A very thought provoking movie - sometimes movie script writers &#34;nail it on the head&#34; and this one does just that.
0452289963|5.0|Thing came very fast and I am very pleased, it is a great read and even better gift for one going through hard changes
B0025KVLRO|5.0|Even though it's been quite a few years since I was a teenager, singing to The Beatles songs. Or dreaming of marrying Paul McCartney, I still enjoying listening to their records or cd's. And when I say records, I mean 45 singles or 33 albums. Yes I still have them from the 60's. I really enjoyed the cd Please Please Me..I did not have the song Ask Me Why or Anna..But, I do now. Thank You for such great service. I will be buying again from you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|im 14 years old and I love it I thank it is good and I thank you should try I hope you like it
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really love this game because if a certain move does not work you can reverse it and try another move.  It's fun to try different moves and hope you get to see the fire works at the end.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|I love this movie!  It's a great story of family and love.  We watched this together in our family home evening and it appealed to our 15 year old and our 9 year old.  Awesome music too!
B005CRQ3IE|5.0|This book is a great addition to any Potter fan collection. JKR  has given us a wonderful new insight into the magical beast world and let our imagination run away from us. I would absolutely recommend this wonderful book!!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Enjoy watching the season episodes in order at my leasure.  Would recommend to any fan of Masterpiece Classic - Downton Abbey.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so much fun! I have alwayswanteda horse but never had any room. I would tell every one get this game! You wont be sorry
B00004TJWE|4.0|This is one of the greats, the best!  The reason I'm excited enough to include a question-mark at the end of the last sentence isn't just that I've discovered yet another English band that never got any promotion whatsoever in the USA, even though they're one of the great bands.  It's also because this album shreds, as far as concept goes.<br />Yep, Who founder Pete Townshend said himself that S.F. Sorrow inspired him to write Tommy.  The official big accomplishment that is, in fact, The Who.  Or, well, it used to be anyway.<br />Things have changed now.  Most people who love The Who's music, prefer Quadrophenia over Tommy.  Quadrophenia came out in 1973, a good 4 years after the hit Tommy, and was The Who's second and final \\"rock opera,\\" or in this case, \\"concept album.\\"  But \\"Quadrophenia\\" was so much better than \\"Tommy.\\"  Even the movie version, which was almost a non-musical affair, as opposed to the wonderful Director Ken Russell's waayyy musical version of \\"Tommy,\\" was better overall.  That is, even though it featured plenty of great music from the original album, it was better than the Russell movie, in retrospect.  I would never have admitted that back in the day, but now--\\"Quad\\" is a better movie than \\"Tommy\\"!!!<br />Anyway, back to this album by The Pretty Things!<br />It's classic.  It's psychedellic, it's wonderful!  It is the Beatles, Stones, or whichever group from those days that you love the most-- this is that album they did but you never heard.  You know, as if they just never released it for god-knows-what-reason.<br />Heaven!
B001TH16DI|5.0|Being somewhat of a &#34;Trekkie&#34;, this set is the answer to my prayers to the Federation! Favorites: Wrath of Khan and The Voyage Home(Spock on earth, interacting with everyday humans - priceless). Nice presentation box and thin cases that take up less space. A nicely done movie set!
B009GED3HS|5.0|My husband and I are huge fans of this show, and season 8 hasn't disappointed so far. We are dying to find out who the mother is!
B004HO6HWK|4.0|Yes, he plays the same character in 95% of his movies, but if you like that character, then you'll love this movie. Ben Foster is brilliant in this as well. I took off one star for it lacking a bit of originality, but I still love it!
B008KE3960|2.0|I had high hopes for this but controlls were not great and moved so slow by the time I felt like I was getting where I wanted to be I forgot what I wanted to do.  May get better farther in but got burned out before getting there.
B00B6ELPIU|5.0|socially/politically aware while remaining artful and very abstract. the knife's most ambitious work yet. not for someone looking for a instantly catchy dance album to play in thee background. this album takes patience and attention. great album art as well
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Beautifully made and a great story over all. So much love, strength, and compassion. You will cry for most of the movie if your a softie like me. I recommend this movie to everyone.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|Good ol' Arnold could get the audience to identify with his character more than Colin Farrell could. Also, dressing Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsdale so closely had a point? What was it??
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I really enjoyed this next addition to the series. I didn't enjoy the book before this one as much, but was really impressed by this one.  Very striking and emotional.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|I love these novel because of the suspense.  The story lines are amazing , the plots are amazing and I love the Jack Reacher character.<br />.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Purchased this for my husband as a gift for his movie collection.  Great movie!  Highly recommend it in the Blue-Ray.
B00C3UUZVE|3.0|Cute game for teaching kids how a garden works. Free version is not very long,  but still worth the download. I wasn't interested enough to buy the full version.
1591391105|4.0|Some of this book is common sense. However not everyone has that! I recommend this book if you're starting a new role. I'm going to give a copy to my newly hired direct report. Although she's not in a management role, I think this will be helpful in her career. I enjoyed reading the various case studies. Haven't finished it yet. I do appreciate the author making distinctions about what to do if you're taking over a flailing project, sustaining success, etc.
B00BJDARGO|2.0|Not A Good Value...Blu-Ray has only 10 Songs and two of the ten are just crowd sing-along/drum solo! Beware!<br />  That's right CD-HEAVEN...It sucks...Wassamatta? Can't sell them now that everyone knows? TOO BAD!! I didn't do my homework and didn't wait for others to review this title before purchasing...and I almost regretted it.<br />  If you look at the great Blu-Ray concert videos out there from Eagles or Rush or Elton John, they use footage from several different performances to make for a long concert experience. Whitesnake has a long list of songs they could have put on here (just like the DVD \\"In The Still Of The Night\\")<br />I purchased Live in Japan on an impulse buy at Best Buy. Now I regret purchasing it w/o waiting for the Blu-Ray reviews. After bringing it home, I saw that there was only 10 songs! (10 songs plus two solos, which don't really count).<br />Here's my dilemma...do I unwrap it and get stuck with it...or do I return it and hope<br />\\"In The Still Of The Night\\" performance is put on Blu-Ray in the future. \\"ITSOTN\\" DVD has 15 plus bonus songs plus companion CD's of the live performance...a great value and worthy of a $20 price point should it every come out on Blu-Ray! If you compare the two, the Live in Japan release is not a good value.<br /> I still love Whitesnake, but I'll wait until another possible release in the future.<br />***UPDATE***  I returned the unopened Blu-Ray...(glad I didn't open it!)
B002KKCVUA|5.0|Time of use at review - Months (ish)<br /><br />PROs - First pair I've bought in many years. I wear these all the time (like right now), very easy to adjust (I have a wide shoe size), comfortable and offer great support for a heavy guy 200+ lbs.<br /><br />CONs - none yet, I don't anticipate having any issues anytime soon either.<br /><br />RATING - 5 stars<br /><br />RECOMMEND - Yes, great all around sandal.
B00AYMKUOK|5.0|I kept waiting for the MMPB version of this book to come out in the US, but after the third push back of the release date, I reluctantly turned to this international version. I like my collections to be aesthetically uniform--hence why I waited for the MMPB--but my patience ran out and I got this instead. I figured the cover design would be similar to the other four books, just slightly different. Much to my pleasant surprise, the cover and binding design match up perfectly with the US MMPBs. No reason to wait until October for the US one.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Time of use at review - Months (ish)<br /><br />PROs - This is a permanent part of my camera bag. A necessity if you take extreme long range shots (the moon), takes shots immediately as fast as you hit the shutter, compact, simple and easy to use and store.<br /><br />CONs - I'm sure there are more advanced devices like this but I have no issues with this at all.<br /><br />RATING - 5 stars<br /><br />RECOMMEND - Yes!
B00AU15HPC|4.0|This 2013 solo album by Justin Hayward is a worthwhile album for Moody Blues fans.<br /><br />Justin Hayward's voice has held up well and his song writing talent is still evident. The band backing him on this album is comprised of some very solid musicians.<br /><br />I've been a Moody Blues fan for decades and I've rated albums like Blue Jays as 5 stars on Amazon. Since I've given a 5 star rating to Blue Jays (a 1975 album by Justin Hayward and John Lodge), I'll give this one 4 stars by comparison.<br /><br />On the downside, there are two techno dance mix versions of \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere\\", a Moody Blues track from the 1990s. IMHO Justin Hayward should stay away from dance mixes of his compositions. For me, the techno approach just doesn't work for Justin Hayward compositions.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I found this an excellent read , I admire  the honesty , I feel as if I am actually there living every moment with him .<br />I couldn't wait to get back to it every time I put it down .<br />No Do-Gooders saying how he shouldn't feel about our enemies.<br />Good on you Mate !
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|So filled with a meaningless attempt at moral philosophy.. Very shallow, just a cheap bible story. Not worth the time it takes to watch.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved this book after reading the first book. I can`t wait to read the next. I recommend everyone to read the series of the Hunger Games. I hope you`'ll enjoy the book the way I did.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I could barely put this series down, even to sleep.  Howey has created a seamless, amazing world and I feel as if I was there, in it.  I recently read Level 7 by Mordecai Roshwald, written in 1959.  It is available in a Kindle edition right here at Amazon, and I recommend it.  I'd love to know if Howey ever read it.  There are interesting similarities, and even more interesting differences, in their post-apocalyptic visions.
B009YMNVMO|5.0|I love this movie.  I had to replace my scratched DVD and decided to get the digital copy. Looks great on the Kindle and viewed it on my PS3 at home on my HD tv and it looked WONDERFUL!  I'm so happy I got the digital copy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the series can't wait for third book due out in June. The book had a great ending with detective spelling it out!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was engulfed the whole way through . It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Awesome read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book has captivated me from start to finish, and military books aren't my typical read. Awesome. Definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00139XSBA|5.0|Tom Wolfe writes beautiful prose. The story is a tribute to the men and women in our space program. Just a great book.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I like the mystery part of this book. It is entertaining. Only thing I consider a draw back is the profanity. There seems to be a lot of it.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|I stumbled upon Maddie on the Internet and looked forward to seeing a new photo as she and Theron traveled the US. It is incredible to see all of the crazy and amusing places she is balanced on.<br />The book is a fast flip though, but one that you'll keep coming back to for the smile it puts on your face.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Most amazing book I have read in years.. Loved ithe caractors were so real and the story so moving I could not put it down
B0021L8V1G|2.0|Iron man 2 is a very disappointing follow-up to to a near perfect movie. Everything that made the first film good is nearly gone from this film. The first Iron Man got praise for being not just a good superhero film, but also as a good character study. So this film had a lot to live up to. While I believe that the creators tried to make something good, I felt that they tried to hard.<br /><br />They tried to give Tony Stark an interesting character arc like the first film did. However, how he reacts and the situations he gets hinself into kind've sours his development from the first film. I find in hard to believe that Tony gets of scot free at the end of the film despit all that he did. Pepper is very annoying in this. All she does throughout the entire movie is yell at Tony. Tony and Pepper's relationship takes a step back in this movie. They seem like they hate eachother here. Roddy is alright. He's probably the most reasonable character in the movie. Black Widow is well cast, but is extremely underused.<br /><br />The villians are even worse. Ivan Vanko comes off as more of a nuisance than a legitimate threat. Justin Hammer is probably the least intimidating villian I've ever seen. He's the most annoying person in the film, and that's saying something.<br /><br />The effects are still great, like the first film. The action is alright, but too short. The final battle is again very anti-climatic. One big problem I have with this film is that there's not much Iron Man in it.<br /><br />This movie also wants to cram as much Avengers material as possible, and it detracts from the main plot. They could have used this time to develop the characters more or have more action scenes.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a big disappointment and a bad follow-up. I'd skip it.
B0019IMVDG|1.0|I don't know what the problem waS but this movie never connected.<br />I calcelled it immeadiatly, but I'm sure I was charged for it.
B00005JPS8|4.0|Iron man is not only one of the best superhero films ever made but also one of the smartest. Like the Dark Knight Iron Man often does not feel like a superhero film. Iron Man not only appeals to comic book fans, but common movie viewers as well. Iron Man is a very interesting and well thought out character study about Tony Stark. We see Stark's transition from a rich playboy, to a relatable person that wants to help people. This film gave new light and attention to a somewhat lesser known Marvel superhero. That's mostly got to do with Robert Downey Jr. playing Stark. He not only looked the part, but the character of Stark is heavily based of Robert's own life.<br /><br />The characters are all good especially Tony. Pepper Potts is also a good love interst for Tony. They have good chemestry together (atleast in this movie). Obadiah Stane is also a good villian, and is a good repesentation of coporate greed.<br /><br />The effects in the film from the Iron Man suit to Tony's workshop are all great. The fight scenes, for the most part, are cool and entertaining. Although, in my opinion, the final fight at the end is quite anti-climatic. I kinda wish there were a bit more action scenes in the film though.<br /><br />Overall this movie is a must see for superhero fans, and just movie fans in general.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|this is a fun game. there are plenty option on character election. have not spent money on game yet( make lot easier.)
B0036EH3WU|3.0|Lost is an interesting and disappointing experience. It starts off very interesting, and left me wanting more. When I finished the series, I still wanted more. Lost to me is like many Stephen King novels. They have magnificent setups, but the payoff at the end is usually underwhelming, or absolutely ridiculous. Lost is not bad, but is very underwhelming.<br /><br />As far as the characters go I have little complaints. All the characters get development, and lots of it. More than half of Lost comprises of flashbacks or flash forwards that develop each individual character. In a way it is a problem, because sometimes it is hard to tell who the main protagonist is. Jack is supposedly the main character, but at times Benjamin or Locke feel more like the main character. Benjamin and John Locke are my favorite characters in the series. They by far the most interesting characters in the story. However, the main villain of the story, in my opinion is a bit inconsistent and underdeveloped.<br /><br />The production values are great. The special effects that are used are decent as well. I really got sucked into this world.<br /><br />The big problem with Lost is that it sets up a lot of questions and plot elements but gives no satisfying answers, or no answers at all. The first two seasons were the best. They had a lot of mystery and intrigue. Season three and beyond were still enjoyable (except season six), but the sense of mystery was mostly gone and it did not feel the same. Season six was an utter mess. Season six, being the final season was supposed to wrap everything up, but instead raised more questions while giving very few answers. The answers they do give are lame. The finale was horrible, leaving many things unexplained.<br /><br />Overall, Lost is a decent show, but does not live up to the hype it builds.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|So I'd been looking for this set for about a year.  It is often sold out on-line and nearly impossible to find in stores.  If you do find it on-line, the price is often jacked way up by third party sellers.  So frustrating for a frugal mom.  The first thing you need to know is that this set in very small.  It has very small pieces and lots of them.  My 7 year old (and now my 5 year old) LOVE to play Minecraft on the iPod, iPad Mini, and computer.  They are young for a 10+ set but I knew they'd love it.  And they did.  My husband had to help them build it and it was tedious and time consuming, but again the kids LOVED it.  If you want to make your Minecraft obsessed kids happy, this is a great set. Just watch the price!
B002ZG983M|4.0|Kick-Ass was an interesting experience. I enjoyed the film for the most part. The violence did catch me off guard a little. I'm not familiar with the comic,so I cannot compare them. The trailer made it seem like it would be a fun superhero film for the family. Make no mistake, this film is not for kids.<br /><br />The main character, Kick-Ass, I found to be decent. I found him very funny and relatable in the beginning. He fantasizes what we all fantasize about . We all want to be a superhero. The problem is that when Hitgirl and Big Daddy arrive, Kick-Ass easily gets overshadowed. That's a problem because he's the main character. Hitgirl is awesome! She is easily the best part about the film. Chloe Moretz does a great job for a young actress. Big Daddy is also a fun character. This is easily Nick Cage's best role in years. Red mist is okay as a sub-villian. The villian played by Mark Strong is okay, but nothing special.<br /><br />The movie is funny and over the top, which is what the film is going for. So it does its job. The action scenes are fun and exciting.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed this film. I recommend this to any diehard comic book fan. Leave the kids at home though.
B008DKBO8G|4.0|This Envelope will cradle and protect my Kindle Paperwhite. It is lightweight and very attractive. Purchased it for a good price and got a good deal.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is one big missed opportunity. The premise of President Lincoln fighting vampires, while absurd, is an awesome idea. In my opinion the film did not live up to its potential. I'm not to familiar with the book. However, I've heard that the novel spanned Lincoln's whole life, and him fighting different vampires throughout his life. In the movie you have the one villain, who is bland and not at all interesting.<br /><br />The person who played Lincoln, did a good job. In fact between him and the one who played Lincoln in Lincoln, while both good, I think that the one who played Lincoln hear was better. Though the character of Lincoln I thought was very bland here. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a good job as Lincoln's wife, Mary. I think Winstead did a better job, than the person who played Mary in Lincoln. Dominic Cooper plays the typical mentor character, but I liked him. The rest of the cast is forgettable.<br /><br />The production values and effects are good, but not great. The production values in Lincoln are better. The fights are okay, but get hammered by constant slow motion. The slow motion gets very tedious and annoying in no time.<br /><br />Overall this movie had potential to be a fun and entertaining film, but does not live up to it's potential. I heard that the original script was written by the author of the novel, but was later changed to what we got. If they kept the original script, this might have been much better.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to say the least at how much I liked this movie.  A friend had recommended it and just to please him I started watching it.  Within a short period of time I was laughing.  Talk about Don't Judge a Book By It's Cover.  I think this describes the movie cover and the characters!  A fun movie and a nice surprise.
B009AMANBA|3.0|Lincoln is a good movie overall, but not necessarily a good movie on Lincoln himself. The movie should've really been called Slave liberation or something. The film does give some development and conflict for Lincoln, which is good. However, I felt that the movie focused more on the slave liberation bill than on the character of Lincoln.<br /><br />Lincoln, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, is a relatable character and a good leader. Tommy Lee Jones, who always turns in a good performance, does great as well. Sally Field, who played Lincoln's wife does a good job acting wise. However, her character was annoying and a bit crazy, in my opinion. She might have been like that in real life, but I still found it annoying. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is barely in the film, and does not do much.<br /><br />The production values are great. They really captured the image of Civil War timeframe. The story was also good. If the film were named something different, I would have been fine with it. However, again, it felt like they were more focused on the bill, than on Lincoln. The film would have been better, if it was an epic that spanned across Lincoln's life, from when he was young, up to when he was killed.<br /><br />Overall most of you should like this film. I personally do not care for the set-up. Plus, I'm not a huge fan of period pieces anyway, with a few exceptions.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Now I love her!  I am not even finished with this book yet but I am enjoying it very much.<br />Ellen is so funny.  I can almost here her as I read.  Her humor is subtle and simple.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky Davis' life is pretty average, apart from her mother's strict ban on anything technological.  Then Dean Holder comes into her life and she is fascinated by him.  Sky has never been attracted to a guy.  Sure, some of them are pleasant to look at and the kissing isn't so bad, but no guy has ever made her desperately want to kiss him like Dean does.  But the more time she spends with him, the more very old memories start to surface, things that were better left buried and after it's all out in the open, will she find a way to keep going?<br /><br />Okay, so before I get to gushing, I want you to go and look at this review: [...].  Seriously, go, I'll wait.  You see that comic strip she did?  That's the most accurate depiction of my feelings.  Holy crap this book will screw with you head in the best way possible.  It's just....I can't even....<br /><br />Sky is a character I instantly loved.  I can see why a lot of people wouldn't like her, but I could relate to her on so many levels.  The further into the story we get, the more I love her.  I love that she doesn't let people walk all over her and how whenever Holder yells at her, she doesn't try to defend her actions, just tells him simply that she's in control of her own life and it's none of his damn business.  Then when the kids at school make fun of her and try to be mean to her, she just smiles and doesn't let it get to her. She's strong and brave and tough and I adore her.<br /><br />Then there is Holder.  Holy crap.  I think him and Lucas from Easy need to have a fist fight and whoever wins will be my top swoonworthy fictional male character because I honestly don't think I can pick.  Dark hair that hides his devastatingly blue eyes and a lean muscled body, yes please!  He's personality is a bit all over the place in the beginning, but trust me when I say there is a great reason for that.  It's kind of like Fight Club in a way, you just want to read it again to see how much sense his reactions make after you learn the truth.  I love him, just freaking hell, yes, okay?  He's loads of awesome.<br /><br />Then there are all the side characters.  Six, Brecken, Karen, and Jack are have things I love about them, but I especially adore Six and Brecken, for each accepting Sky for what she is and just being awesome themselves.  The relationship between Six and Sky is that epic friendship we all salivate over.  You know that girl who somehow gets you completely and is always there for you, even when neither of you know how to help your problems. One of my very few complaints about this novel is that when the s*** starts hitting the fan, Sky isn't sure she wants to tell Six.  I understand that your past is beyond freaking twisted, but I guarantee you that Six would find a way to help...or at least buy you tons of snickers and ice cream as comfort food.<br /><br />The writing is just as good (if not better) than Colleen Hoover's previous novels and the plotline had that awesome thing where it is both predictable and unexpected.  I saw a lot of things coming, but there was one major plot point that just blew me out of the water.<br /><br />My only other issue was the sex one.  Not that this novel has sex in or anything like that, I mean, I read romance novels, but the way it was handled between Sky and Holder.  I'm trying hard to explain this in a nonspoilery way but basically I just think that it would have taken Sky longer to get over her issues.  In my mind, just because Holder explains that he loves her and everything he is doing to her is because of that and no other reason, it would overcome what I believe her conditioned responses would be.  I could be wrong because I'm not in her shoes, but it just feels like that hurdle was jumped too easily.  That was my only major issue and since I could very well be wrong, I refuse to allow it to make me love this story any less.<br /><br />This novel is a rollercoaster ride of emotions.  You will laugh, you will cry, you will shout, and you will love every single second of it and be completely dying for the next installment (which will be from Holder's POV, only adding to the excitement).  Thus far, it's definitely my favorite new adult novel of the year!<br /><br />****Thank you to Atria Books, a division of Simon & Schuster Inc, for providing me with an eARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review****ely dying for the next installment (which will be from Holder's POV, only adding to the excitement).

B00CHVIPP2|5.0|I must say this animated feature film really tugs on your heart strings. It's about a family, albeit in a prehistoric setting, that is normal. An over protective father, a not-so-smart teenage brother, a baby sister with temper issues, a teenage daughter who can't express her own identity, a cranky mother-in-law and the mother trying to keep them all together. This is Dreamworks' \\"The Croods\\".<br /><br />Directors Kirk Di Micco (Spacechimps) and Chris Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) teamed up with Monty Python alumni John Cleese (A Fish Called Wanda, Harry Potter) to also co-write this wonderful story. It is filled with imagination, color, heart and lots and lots of humor.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage  (National Treasure, Face Off) plays the father Grug and is having a hard keeping his family happy. His main mission is to protect them by staying in a cave and fearing everything all the time everywhere to stay alive. His daughter Eep, voiced by Emma Stone (The Help, The Amazing Spider-Man), is trying learn more about her prehistoric world she lives in. She loves color, nature, exploring and so much more. Her brother Thunk, voiced by Clark Duke (The Office, Kick-Ass), is not much more intelligent than a rock and certainly prevents his sister from letting her family know the world outside is not all fear and danger. Why, because Thunk is a walking disaster.<br /><br />Now throw in the mother whose main concern is keeping the peace in the family. The father-daughter relationship is maturing and changing and it seems to be driving the family apart with their different world views - albeit it is 50 million years ago. The mother is Ugga who is compassionately voiced by Catherine Keener (40 Year Old Virgin, Into The Wild) who has a tough job playing the family referee. Now enter her mother Gran, voiced by Cloris Leachman, who adds a whole other level of comedy and compassion to the mix. She hates the dad (so it may seem) and the dad hates her (so it may seem). It is a typical mother-in-law family relationship and boy do you see it, hear it and the adults will have the most fun watching these two interact because of the very funny real humor they add.<br /><br />Its Eep who loves exploration and one day she ventures out and meets a young guy named Guy, voiced by Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) who teaches her that there is color and amazing interesting things out in the world they live it. He also knows that they must travel away quickly to run from their environment which is changing and evolving due to the volcanic shifts the Earth is making. It's a fantasy, sci-fi premise that they took on a humanizing, if in a fun and fanciful way. Oh did I mention that one of the funniest characters is belt that Guy wears? It's hysterical!<br /><br />What surprised me most was the amazing heart this film has. Not only is it hysterically funny with the imaginative prehistoric creatures they've created, but the relationships of the family are real. You'll feel for each of them. You'll laugh out loud several times. Most amazingly you'll be touched by their actions and you might even shed a happy tear or two or three.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri (Back To The Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit) did an amazing score for the films and the kids will love the colors, action and creatures. The adults will love the story, relationships and the very clever humor that is sprinkled throughout the movie. You got to see this one if you love animated films  Check out Dreamworks \\"The Croods\\"  with all your friends and especially your family.mother-in-law family relationship and boy do you see it, hear it and the adults will have the most fun watching these two interact because of the very funny real humor they add.<br /><br />Its Eep who loves exploration and one day she ventures out and meets a young guy named Guy, voiced by Ryan Reynolds (The Green Lantern, The Proposal) who teaches her that there is color and amazing interesting things out in the world they live it.

B005DJREJS|4.0|A surprisingly funny teen show that opens with an interesting premise.  The main actress plays the role well - she's pretty, but not drop dead gorgeous that you can't suspend disbelief that she's a bit of an outcast.  A lot archetypal characters (cooky guidance counselor, head cheerleader B, Jesus freak, etc. etc.) all populate the cast, but what I like is that even as archetypes, they still carry a bit of a twist to them. Would recommend.
1400069807|5.0|This is a great book which gives you an inside look at the food industry. It really focuses on two aspects; the science and the marketing. The author tells us how marketing gradually superseded the science and led food manufacturers to pack their products with salt, sugar and fat. It's remarkable how much insider access Moss gets into the very highly secretive trade secret vaults of food and drink companies. There are some startling statistics presented in the book. For instance, the average supermarket has 60,000 products on its shelf. The average American will eat several dozen pounds of salt, sugar and fat every year. Whatever the variety and looks of the food and drink on the supermarket shelves, the common thread that ties them together is an overabundance of salt, sugar and fat. These three ingredients provide the solution to almost every marketing conundrum. How do you distinguish your product from scores of similar ones? By optimizing the proportion of salt, sugar and fat a little more. How do you induce people to eat what is a thinly veiled healthy product? By masking the taste with salt, sugar and fat. The author reinforces the point that there are almost no products today on the supermarket shelf which are truly healthy and devoid of the salt, sugar and fat which evolution has optimized our bodies for.<br /><br />So is the book an indictment of the food industry? To some extent. But it's really a testament to the ability of marketers and executives to discover the factors which can push all the right buttons in our body, and who can blame them for doing this to sell more of their products? What is without any doubt however is that the proliferation of these three ingredients is leading to an epidemic of diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other chronic disorders that only seems poised to explode. It's clear that if we do not want the life expectancy in this country to decline, we must be alert to the ingredients which are carefully engineered into our food products. Marketers are not going to stop pumping our food with sugar, salt and fat to make it more palatable. There is little incentive for them to do so. It's up to us to read the labels, to research what the products are and to decide what kind of food we are going to serve ourselves and our families. This book is an educational and entertaining step in that direction.od products. Marketers are not going to stop pumping our food with sugar, salt and fat to make it more palatable.

B000IOM1YG|5.0|After TALES OF MYSTERY AND IMAGINATION, I couldn't wait to hear more from APP, and with the follow-up, I, ROBOT, I was not to be disappointed.  It was so impressive, in fact, that there didn't seem to be a way to top THAT. Or so I thought.<br /><br />How wrong I was.<br /><br />PYRAMID, the third and arguably the best of the group's fabled career, takes on the mysticism, fanatacism, fascination and eternal wonder of all things &#34;PYRAMIDIC&#34;...even pondering how man can continue to leave behind stunning wonders of the ages, long after he disappears...maybe the ONLY true way to gain immortality in the first place.  A tuneful and deeply philosophical reminder of how short our time here is, and that like the ancients, we must make the most of that time, if we are to be remembered at all...
1400067820|4.0|If you have enjoyed \\"The Black Swan\\" you will enjoy this book. Taleb talks about antifragile systems that actually gain with disorder. Evolution is a great example. We would all be much less miserable if the financial, economic, medical and social systems that we employed were antifragile. Unfortunately there is much less advice about how to build such systems than how to identify them. But the book is still valuable and entertaining, interspersed with Taleb's signature trenchant wit and eclectic tastes. Definitely worth a look.

B003719GGS|5.0|Pretty much the same as the original, but with &#34;tips&#34; at the end of the chapters.  Waste of money, since I had already read the original.  With that said, the book is amazing and has changed my marriage.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I enjoy good science fiction.  A friend recommended \\"Wool\\" and I'm glad he did.  The series has to be one of my all time great sci-fi reads and I think is destined to be a classic.  Great characters.  Plotting that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Mystery and suspense.  An amazing world.  There is nothing bad in \\"Wool\\".  Very highly recommended.  I'd give it more stars if I could.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put it down! Grabs your attention even st the end. I cannot wait until the third book comes out!

B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this app. I've used several apps of type but this tops all the others! It offers soothing and relaxing sounds and you create your own combinations. Additionally you can download other sounds that have been uploaded by other users. I use this app every night and it truly helps me to relax and get restful night's sleep.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|A creative plot, lots of scares and jumps throughout. It's nice not to be able to figure out where a movie is going.  Not the best I've ever seen, but worth a watch.

B007NCTWX4|5.0|I got turned on to this artist by my wife listening to this station on Pandora.  I started listening to her songs and just felt better while working.  Good vocals that seem powerful to lift you up during a stressful day.  This was on sale thru Amazon download, so picked it up as a gift for me and the wife.  Good stuff!  Thanks.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first I was unsure of whether I was going to like this. I was confused by the narration in the beginning..... but It grew on me. The voice of death was inspiring and comforting. The story of the book thief was beautiful and devastating at the same time.
1451668945|5.0|I always love Mary Higgin's Clark's books and this one is no exception.  The story moves fast and the characters are believable.  I hated for the story to end.  Great reading.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|With so many awards my expectations were set to high.  Dark, plodding and dull. It felt like most of the dialog came from letters and it me wish that Ken Burns had done this along the lines of his Civil War Documentary.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|great cord works wonderful .friend appreciated how you fix the problem .amazon has been great to us . it's just the right length
B009U9S6FI|5.0|could it be that the law of attraction was at work for Dr. Frankl? He continuously attracted those individuals who could assist him, to the extent possible, to make this horrific ordeal survivable. Definitely a must read for those suffering through today's tough times.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works just like it said . it is what it is a calculator . it has come in handy when out and about  on the Kindle. don't really care for the ads but it's free, wish it had an exit button,it's hard to exist the app.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Can't wait for the next book in the trilogy!  This is a wonderful series I almost hate the fact that there's only one book left.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|just as scary as the computer , I did scream a little . easy to navigate, easy to use, dark and scary ,with creepy noise . I downloaded it for my son as well .  I was surprised to find it after having seen Toby's games on youtube playing the computer version of it.
0756405890|5.0|This book came highly recommended to me.  I was told it was the best selling Fantasy debut of the decade and that it is, \\"Harry Potter for adults.\\"  This isn't the best description, but it is a wonderfully told story, the series is based over three days, about a fallen hero reciting his life story for a Chronicler.  A lot has already been said about the story itself, so I'll mention that what really sold me on this book is the narrative structure.  I loved the jumps between the recitation and the story that was occurring in the inn.  This is a well paced novel, with interesting characters, good foreshadowing and an interesting plot.  Rothfuss achieved what it really tricky with a series book.  The ending leaves you satisfied yet looking forward to the next book.
B00881PTRC|5.0|First off let me say that this is a must have game for hangman enthusiasts. There are plenty of categories to choose from. After you have failed to win, they give you an option to look up the meaning of the word through various dictionary sites. The animations are cute and hilarious!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Such an enjoyable weekend, during which I completed Season 3!  I am addicted to this show and eagerly await the new season in January!
0385344228|5.0|This is a well-known bestseller and I have to agree with all those who enjoyed the book.  The central plot is also well-known so I'm not giving anything away anything by telling you that District Attorney Andy Barber finds himself faced with a terrible shock and tragedy:  his 14-year old son is charged with murdering a fellow student.  So what makes this a bestseller?  The first thing is that Landay is an excellent writer and he keeps the story briskly moving along.  In addition, while some of his twists and turns are pretty expected others do catch the reader by surprise.  In addition, Landay does a great job of describing how this horrible chain of events affects each member of the family.  I would say the picture he paints is equally realistic and frightening.  As a somewhat paranoid parent, I avoided reading this book, but in the end, I'm very glad I did.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|enjoy the game the perpetual ads get very annoying and are more likely to cause me to play different games.

B0089LOG02|1.0|Just had to say that as I was reading this, I thought I was reading a book by another author and was enraged that it was almost identical to her last book.  I was totally startled when I realized that I was reading a book by another author!<br />I know there are tons of mysteries, holocaust books, historical fiction, etc and they all are written from the same similar premise, but this one was just so blatant.<br /><br />I recommend that you not read it, if for no other reason than principle!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Another Great Book.  Informative, Very Well written.  I can't imagine the Hell these guys went through.  Thank You to ALL that did serve, serve now and those that will serve.

The Kingston reader was the thinnest and fastest in my testing.<br /><br />I do have some reservations on how secure the card is when it's inserted into the reader, but I'm not swinging it around so it hasn't been an issue.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I watched this movie expecting it to be the prequel to Alien, it' kind of is but not necessarily. It's good on it's own but it ties in the Alien universe.

B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Really enjoyed majority of the novel. Until near the end. The tragedy just did not feel plausible to resolve the ongoing plot of the second half of the book. There is some  wonderful prose,  just not enough to reach a thoughtful and creative conclusion.
B00BP4X7TG|3.0|This movie is exactly what it advertises... a dramatic film about an unlikely pair of people that get along and become best friends. If you're into that sort of thing then by all means check it out

0321543726|5.0|Stroustrup, the creator of C++, wrote an excellent book for those who are interested to learn the programming language itself at an intermediate level.<br /><br />This is not actually a book that explains just an abstract programming language or that explains the concepts of computer programming without concrete examples: it is rather a book that blends in very well these two aspects.<br /><br />Stroustrup also wrote a book, [[ASIN:0321563840 The C++ Programming Language, 4th Edition]], about the C++ language only, but it is a book more concise (but not shorter!) which takes for granted that you already know a lot about programming language.<br /><br />I recommend you read first \\"Programming\\" and only then go to \\"The C++ Programming Language\\"... if you are not still satisfied then you can go directly to read the C++ ISO standard but at that point you are alone with your compiler.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome  great book :) can't wait to read the second book :) it was  soooooooo good has very great details one of my favorite books
1742200508|5.0|I love the layout of this travel book despite the several pounds it weighs.  Lonely Planet breaks down England by region and then alphabetically by city, the exception being the huge section of London at the front just after the country highlights.  The index is extremely usable, so, for example, if you're making a trip to Winchester from London and you don't know where that falls by region, you look it up and it gives you a page range as well as a bold number for where the section properly starts.  From there you get a little map of the main parts of the city, a brief history and then the places most visitors are interested in.  Some activities are suggested as well as places to stay and eat along with how to get there from other places.  Each region section also includes a map of the general area covered.  The front of the book includes the top 20 destinations/places to visit/things that people do/the country is known for.  This front section is the only one in color, though the tear out map is also in color.  The map itself is a bit of a let down, being just flimsy paper and likely to disintegrate if used in the rain.  However, that's the only real drawback I could find with the book.  Well put together with a lot of great suggestions and travel tips throughout.  If you're looking to buy a more current England travel book, this would be a great option or if you just wanted something that covered a lot of ground in a useful and informative manner, this may be it.  You even get info about English customs, food,and history that may be useful to know for the first time visitor.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its fun and constantly challenging. You have to beat the game with in a set time to unlock the next game. there well over 30 games, each game is set in a different scenery. WORTH EVERY EVERY PENNY.
B003F5NSTW|2.0|This book was highly recommended to me, but I really struggled to get &#34;hooked&#34;. This is the first negative review I've ever written but my own inability to &#34;quit&#34; a book without finishing is the only thing that kept me going.<br /><br />I couldn't connect with any of the characters and despite being a mother myself I found the main character repulsive. I felt nothing very entertaining happened from the beginning to the end. The twist others have referred to was predictable and just made me feel even more disappointed.<br /><br />I found the author's style difficult to follow and I wasn't a fan of the whole book told through written letters.<br /><br />I'm sorry, I don't like doing negative reviews but this book took me WEEKS to get through after reading others beforehand in just a few days I feel this one wasted my reading time.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Todays businesses will perish unless they figure out how to compete using tech. Companies need to build up, build out, and manage the growth in a scalable way or they will ultimately fail.  This book did an excellent job of addressing both chaos and how to get rid of the chaos.  The author did a nice job of representing executives and the various failures of executives.  Sarah was a great example of business failure.  She clearly put her self interests above the greater good.
B000TERI3O|5.0|Great songs great singer that really touches you . Drove cross country truck for years listening to Merle on a 8 track tape , it was some great road music
B008QTVNUI|1.0|Homeland should have been an exciting production with the quality of this cast.  But with a lackluster script and hackneyed plotting, the characters have little to do.  The softporn at least makes it watchable, but the time worn set up's between mother and daughter, father and daughter, mentor and trainee, wife and lover, etc., etc., have all been done hundreds of times before, and very often much better elsewhere.  Watch some of the films these actors have performed in in the past, and you get the drift.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Thank you Chris and Taya for a great insight to what both your lives have endured throughout war. I am saddened that Chris is no longer with us. God has cleansed your soul for your heroic duty to God and country
B00BBRPRDG|5.0|Who knew that without Paul Cotton in the band that POCO would sound this good?  As much as I liked his songs, I was surprised how good the quality is without him.  Jack Sundrud has stepped up to bat and hit a home run.  Rusty's songs are excellent once again, and the whole band sounds well, solid.  I love the addition of keyboards, especially the wonderful organ riffs.  With decades of albums to pick from I'd rank this in the top five!  And some reviewers thought this was boring????? WOW!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is very very addictive. And it's a great time killer! Not to bad to be a free game.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book.  Very well written.  I love how the chapters go back and forth from one characters' perspective to the other.  Flynn is a fantastic novelist and Sharp Objects and Dark places are also must-read books.  I can't wait for another one from this author!

B00AGKH7K0|4.0|I have worn out The Animals greatest hits on vinyl, cassette and now CD.  I saw EB had a new CD while browsing Amazon.  No classics but very good music and Eric still has his voice after 50+ years.  Well worth the investment.
0385751532|4.0|It is 1942 in Berlin. Bruno is an innocent and naive young boy who has had an ideal childhood. His father, a high-ranking Nazi officer, suddenly moves the family to a place Bruno calls \\"Out-With\\" in Poland, and Bruno has to leave all his friends behind. Bruno doesn't really know what his father does for a living, but he knows that it's important. Bored in their new home, he decides to embark on an adventure in the woods, even though he knows he could get into trouble for doing so. Bruno wants to explore the world around his house. He is also curious about the people on the other side of the high wire fence near his home. Bruno doesn't know who these people are or why they all dress in what he thinks are striped pajamas. He befriends a young boy, Shmuel, who lives on the other side of the fence. Although they have very different life situations, they get along well.<br /><br />This is a simply written story told from a boy's perspective. It was a very quick read for me, time-wise, but I found myself thinking about the book for a long time after I put it down. I should mention that although this book is narrated by a boy, it is actually adult fiction.<br /><br />The book doesn't go into a lot of historical detail about the Holocaust, but that is not the focus of the book. The focus is on the friendship between the boys.  I did find it a little unbelievable that Bruno didn't ask more questions as a child and try to figure out what was really going on. He seemed a bit TOO naive for a 9-year-old. But Bruno's innocence and inability to comprehend what's going on all around him makes the story that much more powerful, I think. Only a few books have ever moved me to tears, and this was one of them.

B00AG8GTY2|5.0|I'll admit that I am NOT a big fan of \\"southern rock music,\\" if by that you mean Lynyrd Skynyrd, but this bluesy 1969 debut album by the Allman Brothers Band is superb, even hauntingly beautiful, filled with sadness, passion, and soul. The SACD version sounds excellent and is well worth the additional cost. Highly recommended.

B0027MJU00|5.0|I enjoyed the way Gillian Flynn told this story by utilizing various characters' p.o.v.'s throughout different points in time.<br /><br />The story grabs you from the beginning and takes turns you do not expect.<br /><br />It would be an AWESOME tv series on HBO or Showtime - rather than a movie - so NOTHING is left out!

0062059963|5.0|I fell completely in Love with the first book and immediately had high hopes for this book! It had it's hugs and lows and had me so nervous at times that I thought I would have to skip ahead to make sure it turned out ok before I finished a specific part. America while reckless at times is  learning to become a hero! She is so inspiring to me personally! That I think if each of us looked at our own lives to see how we can make a differences in this crazy world we would see that we only need to believe in ourselves be humble for opportunities brought our way and had the courage to pursue that we would me amazed at what we can do!<br />I know it may sound funny but in a way these books make me think if I could do anything with no regrets what would I do? I just need courage and to simply believe in myself and dig in with some hard work and I to can make difference. This is what I learned from reading about America! But yes as to the love triangle in these books in leaves me in a state of awe and nerves lol! I am defiantly Team Maxon but I can't wait to see what book 3 has in store for us!!! Also to hopefully see the Italian connection she made give her an edge up in the selection!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|What can I say about this WONDERFUL presentation......................I love it and cannot wait for season 4.<br />It is a must for everyone who enjoys beautiful surroundings, beautiful clothing, great acting and a terrific story line.
0316056898|4.0|Really, really enjoyed reading this book!  I can't even count the number of times I laughed out loud while reading it. Tina Fey is one very funny woman! Or should I say person, since one of the humorously made points she makes in this memoir is how difficult it has been for women to be accepted in a typically man's world of comedy.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the beginning and end of the memoir where she touches more on her personal life. The middle of the memoir concentrates more on the period of her life with SNL and 30 Rock. While I found the process and her accomplishments very interesting, this section seemed more like a typically written biography/memoir. It wasn't as comedic as the other sections, making the book seem a little disjointed to me.<br /><br />Definitely worth the read as Tina Fey has a lot more to tell the reader than just her life story.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|she's the reason i started watching it, in addition to the fact that i like fringe science. gets a little gory sometimes though.
B007EECSFA|5.0|There are so many twists and turns to this book that whenever I picked it up from where I'd left off it was like starting a whole new story. I grew up on stories about the Blitz but this is the first book I have read as an adult that captured what it must have been like to be in London at that time. I was enchanted by the characters although I had a kind of love-hate relationship with Dolly; perhaps she reminded me of me. And so at the end of the book I am chewing on the question of family secrets--how much honesty do we owe our children about who we were before they came along? The story of our lives can be powerful as it was for Laurel and Gerry. But it can also be dark and, ultimately, we do have to be careful with our secrets.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I got this for my son because he read all the books. The movie was Great! I learn a lot from watching the movie.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Well put together and consistent. Almost beats X Files for mystery and suspense! Love the family element brought in my the Bishops and how they relate to Olivia.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Definitely one of the best (defense) games out there. Fun and addictive. Unfortunately, I started on part 2 and didn't realise it. Although the second part is an improvement on an already awesome game, this one is great all on its own.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read this 850-some page book in about 4 days, while working full time.  Its completely gripping and I was unable to put it down.<br /><br />Here's a very brief, non-spoiler-y plot description: Jake is a recently divorced high school English teacher in Maine when he gets a weird message from the friendly neighborhood diner owner, Al.  When he goes to see Al, Al has aged 4 years over night.  Al explains that his diner has a time travel portal in the pantry.  Whenver you go through the portal, you go back in time to September 1958.  When you come back into the present, only 2 minutes have passed, although the time traveler has aged according to how much time he spent in the past.  Once you've returned to the present, going back through the portal a second time triggers a complete \\"reset\\" of everything that happened the first time.  Al hatched a plan to prevent the assasination of President Kennedy but is now dying of lung cancer and can't see it through.  He gives Jake his extensive notes, based on his research and his tracking of Oswald from '58 to '62 and tasks him with the mission of killing Oswald once he's sure Oswald acted alone.  Of course Jake has to kill 5 years before then (and a couple years before Oswald is even living in the United States), which partly explains the length of the book, and also part of what makes it so enjoyable because he has a lot of interesting adventures in that time.<br /><br />I have to preface this review by saying I've never read a Stephen King book before.  I simply can't read horror, it scares me too much.  So a lot of what I enjoyed about this book is probably not news to King fans.  He writes very well.  The prose is clear and crisp and the book provides detailed descriptions to make you feel like you're in the scene yet still manages to move along at a fast pace.  Somewhat astonishingly, given that its an almost 900-page book, its very tightly spun and there were only a couple of times where I felt the author was rambling orsomething was too wordy.  There were a couple places where I thought things could have been cut out of the plot (such as the brief time the main character spends in Florida between Maine and Texas) but these parts weren't harmful, just somewhat unnecessary.  I did feel like his last year in Texas, spent in the Dallas area, seemed to go on forever (although it probably did for the main character too, so maybe dragging it out was intentional on King's part) and had a few plot points I could have done without.  (The previous time in Texas, mostly spent in Jodie, TX where he became a teacher at a local high school and met a whole cast of interesting characters, including a love interest, is very compelling).  For how much time is spent on the last year in Texas, it also felt like the actual day of 11/22/63 and the aftermath went by very quickly, almost as if King realized he had already written 800 pages and nothing had happened involving Kennedy, so he had better wrap it up fast.  Rushed though it was, I will say that I found the actual ending itself very satisfying and realistic (or at least as realistic as an ending in a book about time travel can be).<br /><br />I enjoyed the first-person naration, which allowed you to get inside the (very likeable) protaganist's head and really experience things as he did.  The book is framed as a memoir of the main character and there are a couple of times he addresses the reader directly that I found distracting, but other than that I have nothing to quibble with about the writing.  I understand there are lots of references to characters and places in previous King novels, so if you're a fan you will surely get a kick out of that.  The protaganist, Jake, lives in real-life Lisbon Falls, Maine but a good portion of the beginning of the book is set in fictional King-universe Derry, Maine where he does one of his first \\"test cases\\" (trying to change something smaller in the past to see what happens in the present) and meets some characters from the book \\"It.\\"  While there's no horror per se, his portrayal of Derry is by far one of the creepiest parts of the book, which I suppose makes sense since there's an intersection with his horror novels there.  (As an aside, according to Wikipedia, Derry is based on Bangor, Maine, a real city that I know very well and have spent lots of time in, so that's sort of terrifying.  I think I will be looking over my shoulder a lot next time I visit.)  In case you can't tell from the previous couple of sentences, for a novel about preventing an assasination in Dallas, Texas, a large part of it is set in Maine, which I personally really enjoyed since I love Maine and have spent a lot of time there.  One of the funniest lines in the book is when he travels back in time to 1958 Lisbon Falls and someone asks him if he's \\"from away\\", a classic Maine way of telling outsiders they don't belong.<br /><br />The book really is sort of three books in one, which partly explains the length.  On its surface, it appears to be a mystery/thriller about the Kennedy assination and other turns of events that happen when he goes back in time, but its also a science fiction story with some time travel tropes explored, and a love story about a boy and a girl who want to be together but have an obstacle between them (in this case, 50 years).  The thriller and the love story are really well-done and incredibly compelling.  The science fiction-y stuff didn't work quite as well for me.  It is inherently confusing and paradoxical, but it didn't seem as well thought-out or as well-researched as the historical stuff.  Jake tells us over and over again that the past is obdurate, i.e resistant to change.  The bigger the change, the harder it is to change the past, so preventing someone from getting paralyzed is easier than preventing someone from getting killed.  Jake experiences this when he tries to change the past in increasingly important ways and the obstacles get more and more difficultto overcome.  At first the obstacles are believable and could even be chalked up to coincidence and really bad luck (a case of the stomach flu, an unexpected person showing up to interfere) but they gradually become more unbelievable and at one point border on the supernatural (e.g. car doors locking while someone is inside, alone).  I wish King would have left the obstacles a little more believable and open-ended so the reader would have been left to wonder whether this guy was getting extraordinarily unlucky or if there really was some force from the past resisting change.  The supernatural stuff was weird, and then it was completely dropped and nothing supernatural (other than, you know, time travel) happened for the rest of the book, so I thought that was distracting.  It happened in Derry, so maybe that's supposed to be the explanation but I didn't like it.  In addition, at some points the past tries so hard to stop Jake from changing it that it almost kills him (or tries to have him killed, or however you want to describe it).  Wouldn't that change the past MORE not less?  Unless you're supposed to believe that, if killed in the past, he would be back in 2011 unharmed with the past unchanged, but that's not consistent with other things that happen in the book (for example,  he takes an injury he gets in the past back into the present).  Despite all this talk of the past being obdurate, and trying so hard to resist Jake's changes, we're also supposed to believe in the butterfly effect, the well-known idea that changing one little thing (even something as small as what you say or what you wear, let alone killing someone) can set off a whole chain of events that can lead to the present being radically different.  But if the past is so resistant to change, why can't it \\"autocorrect\\" itself when something changes slightly the way it was trying to autocorrect to prevent Jake's changes from being made?  I'm not convinced that these two properties of the past couldn't have been reconciled, but King doesn't do so.<br /><br />Don't let these criticisms detract you from purchasing the book, though.  The main character is sympathetic and immediately draws you into the plot, which balances the thriller aspects of trying to prevent an assination of one of the United States' most significant Presidents and the human character study of a lonely guy from 2011 Maine who moves to 1960 Texas, really well.  As I said, the writing is fantastic and the book is so engaging and impossible to put down.  Even though you mostly know where things are going, at least in terms of the historical stuff, its still fascinating to observe (through Jake's eyes) the activities of Lee Harvey Oswald & his family in the years leading up to the assasination.  And Jake is my favorite kind of literary protagonist: not superhuman, not perfect, not always capable of making good decisions, but ultimately a good person that you want to root for.

B00C10N3EW|4.0|A great performance but the sound is just plain weird. The guitars sound too treble and the bass and drums at times just become noise in the background. Still I'd buy it again because of the great playing and singing by Joe Bonamassa.
B00000K19E|4.0|Good movie this is my favorite of the series exactly as advertised but pay attention or you will need to rewatch
B0050DIWFC|3.0|We read this book for a book club selection and it was a very decent read.  It was not a classic but thought provoking.  The question of do we really know our children is a great time old concern and the author is really excellent at balancing his love for his son while leaving the door open for suspicion.  However, the book falls short at really understanding Jacob at all.  The character is very under developed and I did not find myself rooting for or against him.  I would have liked insight into the boy, which I never received.  The novel raises good questions for group discussion, such as when do we lose control over our children, and when do they out grow us in terms of technology and street smarts.  The tone is melancholy so if your looking for a feel good novel or traditional lawyer suspense novel this is not for you.

The &#34;live&#34; singing may not be perfect studio vocals with expert singers, BUT nevertheless, Hugh, Russell & Anne gave super acting performances while holding their own with their songs. They truly touched my heart and soul with their vocals.

B0006VIE4C|4.0|I can not, with good conscience, rate this with a 5-star rating.<br /><br />I know I would probably be preaching to the choir about how much the original Star Wars trilogy affected my life growing up. I, like many kids who grew up in the early 1980's, was a Star Wars fanatic! I lived it and breathed it. My brother and I had a fantastic collection of Star Wars figures and vehicles, not to mention bed sheets, mugs, erasers, folders, storybooks, etc. It was these films that would begin to shape my tastes in cinema and begin to lay the blueprints of the kind of person I would grow up to be.<br /><br />Episode IV: A New Hope, was released just a week or so after I was born, so you could say that the Star Wars franchise and I have a unique bond. We are exactly as old as each other, and it has been with me my entire life and is something I deeply cherish, not only for it's cinematic mastery, but because of the impact it has had on pop culture and the lexicon of a generation.<br /><br />That being said, I find what Mr. George Lucas did to the original trilogy, for the most part, to be utterly appalling. Although I did think they did a great job redesigning the X-Wing assault on the Death Star at the end of Episode IV, I think just about everything else is a joke! You get the feeling at times that Lucas' original vision for Star Wars, based on how he has butchered the films in the Special Editions, was some hokey B-movie with cheesy characters and crappy looking monsters. It completely flies in the face of what he was able to do originally and takes away alot of the innocence of the original trilogy. I wont even go into how bad the prequel trilogy was and how much it has soured me on the Star Wars franchise in general.<br /><br />I'll end by saying, I loved the original trilogy in its unaltered state. If Lucasfilm (now owned by Disney) wanted to make the fans happy, then they'd release the ultimate trilogy Blu-Ray set - a Blu Ray set that includes not only the Special Edition of each film, but the Original, unaltered versions as well, and as an added bonus, a feature that allows fans to \\"cut in\\" only the sections of the Special Editions that they like into the original films, (i.e being able to leave ANH completely unaltered aside from the redone final assault sequence for instance) thus making the perfect marriage of the two editions.

B002SSUQFG|2.0|Compared to my Orient Three Star ( A Seiko owned company) this watch is very inaccurate. The movement looks choppy compared to the Orient, and the case material looks very cheap. Furthermore I had problems where the date never displayed correctly in the window and moved with regular wear. On top of the cheap band this watch is just not as good as other automatics in this price range.

B00B4804KS|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the movie theater when I was 8. On bluray everything looks so detailed. The best part of this is the 3d effects! WOW! I thought it was going to be as good as Titanic, but in my opinion the 3d effects were better on this one! I love Titanic, but they made things pop more on this set. Very well done and worth the watch!!!

B00BAB6CNC|5.0|Well the long awaited part 2 of the Gold and Bones concept CD is out and as expected it is fantastic.  Thematically works harmoniously with part 1 and you will even hear tie ins to songs from part 1.  Stone Sour has created a classic concept CD set that will be looked at as one of the best from this era.

The spectrum of music covered in 8 songs is amazing from Led Zeppelin to Dio, Heart, Badlands, The Doors, Rainbow, Black Sabbath, and Van Halen... WOW!!.  The musical talent of the band is AMAZING.  The fact that they dont just cover the biggest hits of these bands is also a big plus.  If you dont own this, you should just buy it and be amazed.  I will have a hard time taking this one out of the player.
B0042ESTQW|4.0|Well constructed with a snug fit and all buttons functional although slightly harder to find and activate with winter gloves on.<br />In wet weather, the silicon case creates a &#34;kiddie pool&#34; on the display where water tends to pool up instead of shedding.  That's a drawback for viewing the data on the screen.<br />Otherwise, I expect that the case will protect my Garmin somewhat in those clumsy moments when I drop the unit.  That's a fairly rare occurrence and I expect to use this case mostly during fair weather.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is a great movie. The CGI is great but the story line is hilarious. I was rooting for Jack Frost from the beginning. What a likable character. Hilarious movie.

B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|The beauty of this movie alone would have sold me on it, but the story is terrific. I have watched this at least four times since it came out. If you like beautiful cinematography and engaging characters and plots, give this movie a try. Drama, suspense, comedy! Very refreshing for a movie these days.
B0045EJY90|4.0|Now that it's works it plays all my ipod, iphone devices excellently.  When it arived I could not get a CD to play for anything.  So I to it to an authorized dealer (should of mailed it back to save time) where once they got to it turn out the tracking mechanism was out of wack.  turned out to be a simple fix that was coved under warranty.  Now I really like it!

B00B2DSK06|5.0|What a cute movie. The movie is about what happens when no one is playing the video games anymore. It is such a good story and the characters are engaging. Ralph starts out as the outcast but becomes so lovable that you are rooting for him. Great show.
0812982622|5.0|Great book - Johnson weaves a sad and gut wrenching tale (sometimes literally) of an orphan in North Korea, who grows up to defiantly challenge the Dear Leader. Along the way he kidnaps, kills, and tortures, all at the behest of his superiors. Thoroughly satisfied my fascination for all things North Korea, although at times its pretty graphic and heartbreaking.
0871164566|5.0|I have a whole library of wire books, but this is by far the best one I have purchased and I am so glad that I did. The instructions are very clear and the designs are intriguing. I am just learning wire but this book has made my technique better.

0060832819|5.0|I really enjoy Paulo Cuelo and his style of writing. I have read most of his books the first one being The Alchemist.  I read the Zahir many years ago and although I never usually read fiction books twice, I wanted to read the Zahir again. I just didn't want to pay the full price for a book I had already had.  The book I ordered from this seller was in very good condition as described, and I received it very quickly. I am very pleased with this seller. Very reasonable price, very good condition, and shipped out promptly. You can't ask for more!
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a fun game that doesn't require a great deal of thought.  It's good to play during a short break, like commercials.

B00AAQHP66|5.0|I did not go see this is the theater thanks to bad critical reviews. Well, paid movie critics, you got this one completely wrong. I felt the entire movie hit just the right tone in every single scene. Gerard Butler is terrific as the surf mentor to Jonny Weston playing famed surfer Jay Moriarity. The actual surf scenes throughout are amazing and shot so well. Kudos for also getting the soundtrack spot-on with a nice mix of the skater/surfer hardcore (Butthole Surfers, Sponge) to the mellower stuff (Mazzy Star) of the late '80s.<br /><br />The extras are also worth watching with a look at the life of Jay Moriarity (Wiki him, if you want to learn more) as well as interviews with the actual surfers involved in the filming.<br /><br />From start to finish, this captures life in a typical California beach community and the whole surfer ethos.
B005SLGH7G|5.0|Beautiful violin waltz music.  Entertaining also.<br />If you like Andre Rieu, you will love this DVD.<br />Almost like being there.
B006CHML4I|1.0|I ordered this same watch except the color was green on a \\"special deal.\\" The price seemed very good at approximately $35 total with shipping and my son needed a new watch. I let him know that it had been ordered and would be arriving pretty soon.<br /><br />Three days after placing the order I was looking for a tracking number, instead jomashop sent an e-mail saying they had cancelled the order. They had sold more of the watches  then they actually had in inventory. To be fair, they offered me a $10 coupon if I ordered something else with a greater than $50 value, but there was nothing comparable to the original deal. If they had the exact same watch in blue and other colors, why not offer it instead of the green? Makes me wonder if they sold any at that price or if the whole \\"deal\\" was a bait and switch. After all, it is 2013. It's not too hard to stop taking orders when your inventory runs out.<br /><br />Terrible company. Terrible policy. Will avoid in the future.
B007Q0K9ZI|5.0|Love the gospel children's choir featured during this performance.  Takes place in Andre's home town.<br />Almost like being there.  Loved the music and Andre's obvious enjoyment of the whole concert (as well as everyone there).
0143122916|5.0|Reading about babies and children being beaten to death, families being torn apart, children informing on parents, children being severely abused for the alleged \\"sins\\" of their parents, and people being tortured and executed is not exactly my idea of an enjoyable time.  However, all of these things are happening in North Korea and are vividly illustrated in \\"Escape from Camp 14\\".  And while I find the details of Shin Dong-hyuk's life in a North Korean prison camp absolutely sickening and horrifying, this is still a very good book.  As others have stated, once you start reading it, you really can't put it down for long.<br /><br />The fact that Shin escaped is incredible.  Undoubtedly it is a very rare--and possibly singular--occurrence.  But I'm glad he did make it out, if for no other reason than to tell his story.  North Korea does an excellent job at keeping these horrors hidden from the world.  And while I don't know if there is anything I can personally do to try and fight the human rights abuses currently happening there, I do believe that simply reading Shin's experiences is a step in the right direction.  I truly feel for this man...he has been through absolute hell and somehow survived.  I am a very sensitive person and get upset by details such as those contained in this book.  However, despite that, I still felt compelled to keep reading in order to educate myself as to what is happening in this area of the world.  I strongly recommend that many others do the same.  While this is definitely a wrenching book, it is also a very absorbing and important book too.  Read it.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|I toyed with giving this book 5 stars, actually would have given 4 1/2 but that wasn't an option. I thought the first few chapters were a bit boring, no carrot to keep you turning the page. But I'm stubborn and kept on as I've read other books by Baldacci and quite enjoyed them. My interest did perk up, quite a bit. Julie's character was a bit over the top. Yes she was smart both book and street smart, but I felt she was over the top.<br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in spy type mysteries.

B002VWNID6|4.0|...but ends up with an Ed Wood bullseye. This is one of the most unintentionally funny films of the 90s. From Costner's poofy blown dry mullet in utero to Alan Rickman's poofy blown dry hair helmet to Morgan Freeman's Arabic accent that is little more than Moorrrrrish Morrrrrrrgan rolling his Rs, this had me laughing aloud in all the wrong places.  This would only work as a swashbuckler if your pinnacle of celluloid swashbuckling was Monty Python & The Holy Grail.    All in all, a very entertaining film. Just not in the way the film maker intended.

B00B8R1NP0|5.0|This book was TOO good! I was left wondering 'What's next for Max Larkin' - I know it's a good book when I cannot put it down for anything. I even sat at my desk during lunch and read it.<br /><br />The great thing about this book is it's beautifully written and the attention to detail is impeccable. The character development is on par and reminds me of my favorite detective TV shows.<br /><br />From the first chapter with the brutal murder you are pulled in instantly. There's not shutting the book at that point. You meet the main character Max Larkin, who is to say, is not exactly please about his new partner - but throughout the book they come together (not romantically) but as two great partners who play off each other and keep the book moving forward.<br /><br />The victims in the book have essentially \\"wasted\\" the serial killers time and therefore he is on a killing spree. It is up to Max and his new Partner, Jesse, to find the murderer and stop the madness. There are many twists and surprises in this story.<br /><br />The suspense alone is worth grabbing this book and reading it. It's fast-paced and exciting. It gives you enough of the gore without making you feel like your stomach is in knots. Loved it! Cannot wait for more!

B006QVRVJK|3.0|I liked the moviE...like Jim Carey says, A LOT!<br />I did not like the fact that the seller...didn't clean the DVD front.  It had oily substance fingerprints.  The movie side was ok enough to clean and not have &#34;freezes&#34; on the movie as it played.  Otherwise I would have asked for a refund-return. I would not buy from this Seller again, because i believe if a person if going to sell an item they should take the time to clean their cooties off of it.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I am so addicted to this game!  I never write reviews, but I've hit an issue that I can't resolve or find the answer through google.

While I really don't mind that, haha, I have very little income happening since the dinos aren't doing anything. Any advice?
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Excellent read! I think everyone should read this book.  It is a life changer... Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!
B005LAIIJY|3.0|I'm a white person and I was APPALLED to see how white people were treated in this movie.  In one scene a poor white person is whipped repeatedly...  In other scenes white people are being shot.  It's an embarrassing look at history, to see how white slave owners were treated in the South.... So poorly, and without remorse.  I think all who see this movie will leave it feeling sympathy and sorrow for white people.  This movie shows how badly white people have been treated... Thank god white people aren't treated like this anymore.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved it.  I have to rent the movie now to see how closely it follows the book!  Great book!
B008L40Q7E|2.0|The movies at least tell these fantastic tales with tongue firmly in cheek. If this is an example of Ian Fleming's writing, I'd say he lucked out that some one came along and decided to transform his little tale into a silly but fun movie.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|Makes the President sound like whiner and a big baby when he could not get his way!!! What a sad image of SUCH A GREAT MAN!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Well-written, great British acting, compelling story-lines. Addicting. Amazon Prime offers a great advantage of allowing me to watch as many episodes as I want at a time, and at my convenience.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|Horrible movie - uses lure of animals and adventure to shock you with Cannibalism and the worst aspects of human behavior.<br /><br />Not appropriate for any viewer unless you are already a psychopath!
0807014273|5.0|I've reread this book many times and it still brings tears to my eyes by how it has made me think and challenge me to be a better person.  My favorite quote from the book is, \\"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual. \\"<br /><br />PLEASE READ!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing. I honestly thought it would be crap but I couldn't put it down. I just loved it, surprisingly!!!  A
B000GCFG7E|3.0|It's okay, I've read a few in a row,,, so mabye I'm bored with the formula. Still an okay read.

1881273873|5.0|A must read for singles searching for love. Opened my eyes to how to show love to anyone you love and understand how to see how someone else shows their love for you.
B0086700CM|2.0|I didn't like the game. it was too fast for me to catch on, so I just deleted it. It is more for teens or young kids. I am a slow senior.<br />Joan
B002IVLH60|3.0|There´s some good songs on BACKSPACER, but in my opinion, this is BY FAR the less inspired album from the great PEARL JAM....It´s BY FAR the PEARL JAM album where you can find more ballads and soft Rocks than HEAVY tunes....I understand that the band grow old, but i REALLY miss Vedder´s roars and screams and the furious guitar duo of songs like DO THE EVOLUTION and ANIMAL....Backspacer is full of ballads, with 3 or 4 more rocking songs, reminding a lot what U2 used to do....It´s by far the PJ album i care less...............
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A good read. Kept me engaged and entertained throughout. Simple but feel good book, which is exactly what I was looking for
B00001NFCY|5.0|HUMAN CLAY, CREED´s 2nd album got great songs like WRONG WAY, BEAUTIFUL, NEVER DIE and the title track.....a, i remind when this come up in the late 90´s and everybody talk about CREED´s sound being a total PEARL JAM rip off......Yes, the singer voice is like a Eddie Vedder for the radio....actually, on HUMAN CLAY i think he incorporate some Chris Cornell too....but know what, i really like this album, even if some songs sound exactly like SOUNDGARDEN, ALICE IN CHAINS and even STONE TEMPLE PILOTS.....if you like the glorious GRUNGE movement from the early 90´s, i think you can really like this one, besides the lack of originality and the radio ballads.....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining!!!  It's not your run of the mill build and plant stuff....  they add fun side games and challenges!!!  Sometimes it can run really slow but most of the time its good!!!
B00004XOWM|2.0|This is really the last breath of Limp Bizkit....After 2 albums that made huge success in the late 90´s, Bizkit recorded this really silly collection of Rap NU Metal songs.....That Rap posture destroyed what could be a good band because Bizkit´s debut is good, with more gutural vocals....Some lyrics here are completely embarrassing, with lots of f*** and s****.....WOW! Fred´s lyrics must be the worst of ALL TIME!!! While i think the duet with Scott Weiland on HOLD ON is a great song, and i barely like others like ROLLIN, MY WAY and TAKE A LOOK AROUND, this album really sucks.....
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|This cd wolf is simply amazing..... Not to mention the items that come with the deluxe hard copy! Thank you tyler
B000001Y42|3.0|After the huge BOOM of NU METAL bands that came after KORN, this debut from Limp Bizkit is BY FAR one of the most interesting things to surge....In fact, i really like songs like COUNTERFEIT, POLLUTION, STUCK and CLUNK....Limp Bizkit started as a furious band with almost DEATH METAL vocals and HEAVY songs....There´s some songs that are not so good, but this is BY FAR the best moment from LIMP BIZKIT...as other reviews said, what destroy their sound is Fred Durst posture, with incredibly silly lyrics and a White rapper way of life.....
B009T1J0PM|4.0|I bought this book in the morning and finished it the same day. It's a really good book and I really like the series, though I kind of want greg to get a girlfriend! P.s what happened to Holly Hills?
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I'd give this a 4.5 but since it is not your usual run around from HO cluster to HO cluster I'll bump it up. This js not a hand holding game which is great!  Played on KF hd no probs. Ok, it was a little short but very enjoyable. Instead of the typical HO cluster to find, this is a game that you need to hunt throughout to find the various tools to use.  You don't have to sit thru endless storyline.  You can flip thru the text and get moving again. I'm glad it's not a spooky, try to scare you game. Five bucks? Eh. Then again, these days you pay more than that for a burger and this game lasts longer.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Unexpected ending. Nice little read. I enjoyed the humor immensely as well.<br />I recommend a comfortable chair and some tissues.
B0084670FU|4.0|it was a good movie. It had a very slow start but eventually picked up. too long, in my opinion
B00881PTRC|5.0|First this app is not 99 dollars. It is 99 cents, whoever cant understand money shouldn't buy anything. Especially J Miles!
B007FXLZ9K|4.0|Interesting look into the life of two troubled people.  The story never goes into why they are both so troubled what happens in their past to make the me way they are, but you get a look into the results.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I like this book it was a great read an  very fun to follow I would recommend this to others although at sometimes it was graphic I am 12 yrs old and it seemed a little mature for me. Other than that this is a must read book
B0064MPXFA|4.0|i am surprised that i like it so much. i usually go for action/dramas.very well acted  and produced. good wife is in its 4th season and i look forward to more.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|I absolutely love the box set. It's everything the hoped it would be. It also sounds great I really recommend this box set.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This is totally off the beaten path of my reading realm. I loved the clash of &#34;old knowledge&#34; and modern technology. And... There is  charming genuine quality about the story that kept me engaged.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful cast. Terrific story. What's not to like ? But as old as it is, why did I have to pay for it ?
B007M45PMU|5.0|You may only know the 2 songs they play on the radio but this entire cd is awesome - I love all of the songs.  It's such a bargain for only $4 - totally worth more than that!  Buy it - you won't regret it.
B000IMV4IW|3.0|Just yur typical english pop vanity style pop rock.<br />11 more words required, numbers do not count, weird 2 say daleast....
B001BANK32|2.0|I tried twice in my life to get into this book; just can't do it.  I'm disappointed this time as I wanted to read it before the sequel come out.  Sigh.
B00AFEY354|5.0|have not had the chance to watch but my 80 some friend from San Francisco liked enough to ask me to prchaseit 4 him.<br />He likes it, i may like it if i do end up watching it. Maybe....
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show very addicting! Can't wait for next season! Great acting and great story lines. Very human and not Hollywood.
1401938906|5.0|I love it so much I bought one for my son. Both him and his wife love it. Good things are happening!
B000001GPX|3.0|I guess I'm one of those dissenters:  this is not the be-all-and-end-all Beethoven Fifth.  In fact, Kleiber's Beethoven Seventh is much better for me.  There is something electrifying, almost primeval in the Seventh and Kleiber nails it. Every time I hear the Seventh I find something new and wonderful and I'm literally sitting on the edge of my chair.<br /><br />Beethoven can be profound and exciting simultaneously, but I find neither profundity nor excitement in Kleiber's Fifth.  I've listened to it many times, and I have yet to feel impressed by it; I prefer Bruno Walter and Arturo Toscanini for \\"historical\\" performances, Daniel Barenboim and Georg Solti for more modern performances and John Eliot Gardiner for period performance for both the Fifth and the Seventh.<br /><br />I believe that  \\"definitive\\" is in the ear of the listener.  There is more than one way to interpret Beethoven and whatever path you take to get there, it's worth it to experience what Beethoven has to offer.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|After Infinity On High i thought they couldn't do something better. I was right, but Folie A Deux is so close, it's perfection. If Infinity is 10/10, This is 9.9/10.
B00BDSRFG0|4.0|What is in the water in Sweden? (Fish wee and pine needles - ed.) But the amount of quality music emanating from this country is astounding especially as there are only about 10 different musicians playing in about 50 quite different bands!<br /><br />I don't think you can go too far wrong with any of the Beggar's releases but this ramps things up to a new spiritual level. If you think that the pinnacle of Hard ROCKING music was the mid 70s then this is the baby for you. Like a Turbocharged METALISED Deep Purple MkIII with nods to MkIV Purple.<br />Plenty of true RIFFAGE from Mr Amott and Mr Wiberg interjects great Hammond SLABS and is that a Fakeotron I hear?<br /><br />One of the better releases to hit my DEATH DECK this year. If only I'd shelled out for the Limited edition.<br /><br />For anybody with an interest in ROCK this is a BUY! Tell 'em Troll sent you.
B00BCV3HGU|3.0|I mean, i love The Black Eyed Peas but i'm not gonna lie... the album is far from great... bad lyrics, generic music. Some tracks are very good others are average... Will is capable of so much more.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Love this game having lots of fun with grandson looking up the different dinosaurs. Would be nice if the values for items were better but if you are patient you will level up. Kids can have fun learning some money values.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I have played a lot of Match 3 and this one is very fun. Haven't noticed any hitches. Arcade mode is awesome.
1593082037|5.0|Never ready Sherlock Holmes before.  The work of AC Doyle was brought up in a literature class.  I was curious so I dove it.  I am really enjoying it.  It is easy to read and is especially interesting knowing more about its origins.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|Our book club read this book recently, and everyone loved it! We have a mix of tastes in the group, so I was impressed at the lovability of this book! Despite the fact that this book was published 13 years ago, it reads like it was written yesterday. Once it sucks you in, you won't want to stop reading.
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun. the whole series is enjoyable and grows with the audience. I'd recommend it even though it doesnt follow the book 100%
B00AFROVQC|3.0|A great plot and story idea, but a little soft on the writing. There is repetition of events and the hero's always seen to win....
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars is the sounds for the alarm. Like the dim feature.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This Game Is Super Cool!!! I Love Mystery Games Because They Leave You With Suspense!!! And They Are Really Fun!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a book that I can never have enough words to describe. It is just that good. Loved it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't get enough of Downton Abbey!  My husband and I watch an episode every night, and I never want it to end!  I could watch it for hours.  And my husband, who hates period shows/movies, is now addicted.
0307278255|4.0|This book is  such an easy read. The stories are great and the whole flow of the book seems effortless. I really enjoyed reading it. I read it for a Literature course in college and writing an analytical essay on this book was such a breeze.
1451620829|1.0|If you like to read porno, I guess you may like this piece of trash. If you like reading the f word over and over again, by all means this is for you. Decadence in vivid detail. I've read many rock biographies. Some bad some good. For me, this one is the worst yet. I felt as if I were listening to a bragging, foul mouthed, perverted, uneducated teenager ramble on and on.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|don't get this app it doesntwork when I try to set an alarm it says &quot;alarm unable to be saved&quot;  or it just doesn't gonoff at all!!!! bat rateing
B0095XPZBC|5.0|As someone who grew up watching Star Trek: Next Generation on TV when it originally aired, seeing the tremendous improvement in picture and sound is amazing. Further value is added by the terrific bonus features, including a sit down wih the cast for the 25th anniversary of the show's oriinal airing. I probably am biased, because I love this franchise and this series in particular, but anyone who wants to see great science fiction presented in the best way possible should consider this.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Would rate a 5 but after so long of playing n mastering levels it begins  to lag and skip or freeze on you.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Infidel is very well written and important!<br /><br />I feel like I understand the Muslim faith better if only from Ms. Ali's point of view, which I sadly fear is the case, the oppression of women, honor killings even in Holland that Dutch authorities discovered at Ali request once she was a member of the Dutch Parliament. She is an amazing person, and brave.<br /><br />Every person in Western nations ought to read Ayaan Hirsi Ali's Infidel.<br /><br />Russell Traughber<br />Author, DRIVING THE BIRDS
B001609SQA|5.0|Nothings better than watchin' some aliens get blown apart. It was my day to remember how we used to feel about them.(SICK)
B001AW156U|5.0|I like how they feel.  Now after using them, the controller feels weird without them.  Be warned, they WILL pop off if your wife drops the controller off the couch.  However, they have easily popped back on (at least 10 times). Very durable.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have really enjoyed the books so far and am looking forward to completing the trilogy.  wasn't sure how I'd feel about it but it has been a great series of books.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|We saw this in the theater before we had kids, and recently watched it again with our 1 and 3 year olds.  It's still a great movie!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|No, really! What a great film. Realism, excess blood splashing all over, silly hero-types, silly Southern racists, great locations... just a great film!
0307719774|4.0|I have enjoyed the majority of the questions so far and it's only been a few months.  I don't feel like any of them have been something I wouldn't want others to read someday.  A few haven't applied to me, but most of them are thought provoking.  As a few other reviews mentioned...I wish that it had a ribbon to keep my place instead of a bookmark sticking out of it, and I wish that it would open to lay flat.
B008602KQI|3.0|I heard a lot about this movie, and watched it while running on the treadmill. Too much violence for me.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoy watching Downton Abbey. It shows life as lived @ that time, the very wealthy landowners, but also, the very large staff of people and the way their whole life was; working & living in the large home.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I found Lincoln to be entertaining and informative. I think that life would be more interesting with this kind of leadership in the world today.

B005T87QCI|1.0|I have Kindle Fires for all 3 of my boys and they all play the Real Steel game to no end so I bought them all of the robots and the option to build their own.  They have had them for over a month.  After your last update, they have been locked out for a week or 2? Now today it updates and all of their robots I purchased are gone.  How do I fix this?  I see there are 2 new robots, so I know changes were made, but I would like my Amazon account refunded if we don't have our robots anymore, or if you have a way to reopen them on their kindles that would be fine too.  I would be happy to give this 5 stars if you fix my lost robots...<br />Thank you for your help,<br />Cindy Livingston
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|A contemporary rewrite of Goldratt's &#34;The Goal.&#34; There are so many things painfully true in this text that the first part is hard to read.  It is not because of the writing: it is the painful truth of similar personal experiences in the field. The novel format allows for fuller explanation/exposition of key technical and non-technical concepts. It is a must read, but it is a great read. Great for sharing with colleagues or clients interested in DevOps concepts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love any game that keeps me occupied when im bored and this one surely does....there is nothing i enjoy more than trying to beat everyone's top score
B005RJ6AIK|4.0|It really puts you in the mood for Hawaii.  Island music at its best.  Has a calming effect and is relaxing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book!  There were a lot of things in there about engineering feats that were over my head so I skipped over them.  Still, I couldn't wait until I'd finished the book to see what happened to this guy.  If they make a movie of this, I'll definitely watch it!  This might be one that guys might really like --  because of all the tense action in it and all the obstacles and \\"fix-its\\" the character comes up with.  Reminded me somewhat of the movie \\"Apollo 13\\" as far as \\"edge of your seat\\" and \\"what's next\\" scenarios. A GREAT READ!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I can't wait for the next season to be released, yet I don't want August to get here too soon!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I loved the history.  It was well-researched and a very interesting twist to include story of an indentured servant!  After starting I could not put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn concocts a page-turner of a story, using alternating narrators. The story promotes thought about how we construct our identity, about &#34;falling in love,&#34; about our need for love, about mental illness, about what makes a healthy relationship, about writing and the &#34;unreliable narrator,&#34; and about parenting, among other things. I found the ending unbelievable and more a set up for a possible sequel than anything else, but I would still recommend the book.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|How well do we know our own children?  This interesting plot involves so many twists and turns it will make your head spin.  The author forces the reader with children, and all of us, to vow to be more involved.  The characters are so real.  I completed this book for my club a month ahead of time!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever!!!! Great scenery and great graphics!!! I greatly recommend this movie and the sound is amazing.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Very high quality CD, the Iron Sheik class. About middle of the road Trent Reznor projects and middle of the road  Trent Reznor is better than 95% of all other things.
B001DM1VXE|3.0|This movie was disturbing yet captivating and entertaining. It has a pretty dark side to the plot although I would recommend seeing it .
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This film had me on the edge of my seat and I knew how it ended!!  Excellent.  Very well done.
B006LSZECO|1.0|No opinion  haven't read book as of yet, I ordered it by mistake then had to; cancel as I was meaning to buy another book below it.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I Love this album! I've been a fan for years and this reminds me of an electronic blues album.  Glad to see them back at it and on tour.  I recommend it for any hard-core fan or anyone new to them.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|Not much else to say, kudos to anyone that got it to work with Windows 8, it seems that for everyone that does get it to work, there's at least 2 that can't.<br /><br />Globalstat cheaped out and had a third party create the drivers or something (that's what they said minus the 'cheaped out' part), and then recommend simply buying a more expensive unit they provide if all else fails.<br /><br />There's even a new Windows 8 driver put out by the \\"Prolific\\" company who made the drivers, but even that doesn't work.  There's just something wrong with the way Windows 8 recognizes this unit, it technically sees the GPS connected to my USB port(s) but for some reason will simply not initialize it.  I tried everything on almost a dozen different forum threads trying to work around this, too numerous to mention here.  No luck.  Returning it tomorrow.<br /><br />I think I'll try a different company altogether if there are any.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I grew up admiring Abe Lincoln and this movie did him the justice that I was hoping it would. The cast was great and Daniel Day Lewis portrayed Lincoln in a very respectable and lifelike manner. I strongly recommend this movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a pretty good game and it's challenging and you have a variety of characters you get to run on trains and collect coins to get some prizes
B001NHNG64|5.0|One of the best Reacher tales of characters that I have read.<br />Cool, imaginative, and furious cover to cover Loved It.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I couldn't put this book down once I started it.  It was well written and the characters were well-developed.  I highly recommend it!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|What a wonderful story and I highly recommend it. Great story about the southern plantation and the slaves real life.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this CD and would highly recommend it. If you like any of Adele's songs you will love this cd.  Great seller also arrived quickly would do business again.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a great end to a great series. Sanderson not only did a great job finishing these for Jordan he also did a great job finishing this for the fans.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is so easy to download your books, even the free ones. Syncs with all my readers so I don't lose my place no matter which  one I pick up.
0571238343|5.0|This is a great resource for anyone who does any kind of animation, whether it's computer animation or a flip-book! I think it really makes the difference between making something seem to actually be alive vs. just making something move. Certainly, it will make your animations seem more believable and much more interesting to watch! Be forewarned that if you do computer animation, you'll be doing a lot more frame-by-frame rather than just moving an object along a path...
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Different than the movie that I have watched for years but the book also kept me interested. Would recommend it.
B001NLL0RW|5.0|I love this whole series. Visiting locations all over the world with these characters draws me in every time. Never disappointed in any these books. Looking forward to many more.

B00899F0G8|5.0|I watched one episode with my daughter-in-law and I fell in love with this series.  Each episode puts a new twist on the story.  I can't wait till June to see the new twist and turns.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Full of everything you need to make it great. Love the characters and how the story links them together. It was hard to put this book down and not to finish it in one day. :)

076421120X|5.0|Revealing Jesus: A 365-Day Devotional is by Christian praise and worship artist Darlene Zschech. As a long time fan of Darlene Zschech's music, I was very excited to get a chance to read and review this devotional book. First of all, the book is really beautiful. It is hard cover and there is a green and gold color scheme that is carried out throughout the entire book. The book opens with a forward from the author describing the background for the devotional. In addition, it explains that there is a companion CD of the same name with songs that are intended to fulfill the same mission as the book.<br /><br />Each devotion includes a date and title, a relevant Bible verse, devotional thoughts, and a short final prayer. The devotions are one page long. At the beginning of each month, there is a 2-page spread with art, a statement of what Jesus is or does, and hymn or song lyrics that underscore the attribute of Jesus. For example, in April, the statement is, \\"Jesus is the Holy One of God. He alone is Holy\\" along with handwritten words from the hymn \\"Holy, Holy, Holy\\". A few of the devotions simply include the hymn lyrics as the meditation portion along with a Bible verse and prayer.<br /><br />As a musician, I love this devotional. The words from hymns stick with me and often come to me at times when I need them. I spent many nights singing hymns to my sweet daughter when she was awake or crying. I like how practical these devotions are. The author takes the verses and explains and applies them to our daily lives. The devotion for today (April 25) was all about worry - and it was exactly what I needed today. Many devotions also address the concept and topic of worship.<br /><br />I did receive a copy of this devotional from Bethany House; all opinions are my own.
B00APUQH0W|3.0|I admit, I like JT in movies - don't hold it against me! And you can't really miss with Clint Eastwood, and Amy Adams. So the cast is great. The movie...as expected. We made a nice dinner and a movie night out of it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Why is it just as a book gets going and you can't put it down you find you have just read the last page...would love to tell the best parts but it would give away too many secrets. I can say it is nice to have more mystical things in this book.

And this review has been long overdue.<br /><br />Let me tell you why I think everyone should check out The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook by the fabulous, award-winning, food blogger Deb Perelman whose blog I've been following quite religiously for a few years now. Her recipes are creative, inspiring, scrumptious, and yet absolutely approachable. I simply get lost every time I open this cookbook because I keep turning the pages, unable to decide what I want to make first - everything looks and is delicious. All of Deb's recipes both from the cookbook and her blog [which you should check out here] that made it to my family's table turned out wonderfully, and several made a few reappearances since. Clearly I can't help but gush about how awesome this cookbook is and my opinion might be absolutely biased [but that's why you wanted it, right?] but trust that I'm not the only one expressing my love for this cookbook.<br /><br />The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook offers a variety of recipes, and there are at least a few to satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. From breakfast, to dinner, to party recipes and desserts, I promise you will have a hard time choosing just one recipe to try first. Prefacing each recipe are delightful stories, suggestions, ideas, and personal family anecdotes that not only help frame these recipes but set a wonderful tone for the whole cookbook. [Yes, it is one of those cookbooks you would also love to read!]<br /><br />Aside all my accolades and love for it there are minor formatting pet peeves that I happily ignore in favor of my awe, but here they are nonetheless. Because of all the stories each recipe tends to run over several pages and while ingredients list might appear on page one, the recipe directions might not come until a few pages later.  Also, don't expect an index sorted by a category - it is simply a list of all the recipes in alphabetical order, which I found a bit unhelpful. Still, i think it is a beautiful, functional cookbook that any cook would love to have in their kitchen. So, do yourself a favor and check it out and I guarantee that you will fall in love with it as much as I had.
B001K3EXTA|4.0|Robert Redford was as handsome as ever. The movie was a little slow but it picked up and was entertaining.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|As Delirium trilogy comes to a close, I find myself quite emotionally involved with these characters and their dystopian world that has been so masterfully crafted by Ms. Oliver. Truly, the beautifully lush writing alone would make me recommend these books, but there is also quite a lot to leave you pondering long after you have closed the book. Of course, you have the required elements of a YA romantic triangle, the struggle against the society that has fooled itself into believing perfection can be achieved by simply eradicating love, the thrill of suspense, action and sacrifice for the greater good, and much more.<br /><br />As many readers know there is no lack in YA dystopian literature nowadays. The shelves at local bookstores are filled with myriads of shiny, intricate covers with promise of exciting adventures and strong heroes and heroines, so I’ll refrain from recapping the story here. What I loved about this particular story is its rich, vivid world building, imperfect heroes that acted foolish and childish at times, but were still able to prevail.<br /><br />I felt that the novel raised many good questions and explored interesting themes of love, jealousy, cruelty and freedom. At times, I felt the Delirium world was a “Stepford Wives” type of society that urged to create a sense of perfection via artificial means. But in the end, when you cure love what is left underneath? – Hatred, cruelty, calculated coldness? Deliria-free world certainly offered a grim outlook on society. There were many up and downs as this was as much an emotional journey, not only for Lena, Alex, and Julian, but for the reader as well. The life in the Wilds, did not offer much salvation, instead all three were thrown in the midst of the brewing war, which has a sense of being far from over at the end.<br /><br />As Ms. Oliver urged us to take down the walls in the last paragraphs of Requiem, I felt a bit disappointed that I won’t learn more of what happens to our beloved characters. So many questions left unanswered in the end. I desperately scanned through the last pages again to find bits and pieces of information. What is to come of Lena, Alex, Julian, Hana, Annabel, and Tack and many more who played a pivotal role at one time or another? Imagination – that is what Ms. Oliver offers us at the end – leaving things wide open so we can decide what is next for our beloved characters, whose lives we’ve become invested in so greatly, that we spent unreasonable late hours up – reading. Alas, it is the author’s creative freedom and I admire the choice of the unconventional, or perhaps, this was a convenient solution to the impending Delirium TV series that could potentially go beyond the books. No matter the resolution, the Delirium trilogy is still a great read.characters. So many questions left unanswered in the end.

B00782O7NE|5.0|This film was so moving and emotionally raw. I absolutely loved it and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. Being in black and white only added to it, as well as the lack of conversation....beautiful and touching, yet most of my family and friends have dismissed it off their movies to watch list.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is a very fun yet yet very challenging game. The first few rounds are easy, but get harder as you go. I love the the challenge!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|What a great series to watch! Excellent characters and acting, and plenty of drama, romance, and action.  I cant wait to watch season 2 and 3!
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Chapters on orphanage very harrowing. Too much blather from Rose. Excellent twist at the end. Enjoyed it better towards end.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|What a great season 2! This is a top notch series to get lost in!, Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, war, romance, and passion.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun to play and can be very addictive. So you should only play when you have time kill or are board.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Love this movies, great detail, wonderful special effects, great acting well worth watching! Great sequel showing how it all began!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The betrayal, mistrust, and sheer stupidity was hard to get through at first, but as it carried on it just got better and better! Without giving things away, I'll say that I wish she could just dump Aspen, and I can't believe she still hasn't fessed up about his presance. America needs to start trusting Maxon, and if I had my way I'd murder the king. Scandolous! Neither America nor Maxon are trustful and communicating, but it's still interesting to watch it all play out. TEAM MAXON! Can't wait for the next book!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Didn't know what to expect when I chose it, but the advertised story line (re: a book cult and funny) intrigued me.  It turned out to be quite light reading.  (not at all bloody or violent as some of these &#34;cult&#34; type books tend to be.)  The story took us &#34;tongue and cheek&#34; into the world (real or imagined) of a book cult and Google with a few chuckles along the way.  (chuckles, not hardy laughs) The writing style was fluid, as if spoken by a friend, but not written in memorable prose.  I still enjoyed it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love rick riodoran he writes the best books I can't wait till the next one comes out. The end made me cry! It is sad :)
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like that you can make them harder as you go along.  great for enjoying some down time.  wish it would save my work.  haven ' t figured out how to do that yet.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|All the favorites are here.Brings back fond memeries.Couple of songs missing but still 5 stars. Where are they now,In a beautiful house?
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|For free its OK, but if you had to spend a few dollars for it, you may want your money back.<br />The game can get boring and the tile stacks hard to determine their depth.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Just joining in the chorus to bump the rating for this remarkable 3D conversion, the best I have seen. Clearly the studio spared no expense to create such a great conversion and I hope this raises the level of quality for others. A great movie has become a whole new viewing experience with this fine 3D work. We will keep buying conversions like this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome! I can't stop playing it. All my friends had it so I decided to get. So far I'm <3ing it.
0765325950|5.0|Ordered them as gifts for my husband and brother in law.  Both were thrilled and couldn't tear themselves away from them.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had not felt the kind of emotion towards a movie like this since Harry Potter. I enjoy reading before watching, and that is exactly what i did. This movie covers chapters 1-7 of The Hobbit so i suggest you read before you watch!<br />Either way, It's a good watch.<br />I recommend.<br />Martin Freeman did a good job impersonating Bilbo. Radagast... RADAGAST *fangirl screech*<br />They did leave out some scenes from the book that i would have been glad to see/ would solve bilions of non readers' questions (i.e. &#34;Why don't the Giant Eagles take them all the way&#34; if you read Out of the Frying Pan, Into the Fire it will answer that plainly).<br />Other than that, the special features will make you wish you lived in New Zeland. The cinemotography and locations are amazing, the new way of filming makes it feel like you are the Fourteenth honorary member of the party, I need to see it in 3D so idk about that.<br />Overall, Good Job!
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Straight up great. Use it daily. Easier than most out there. A couple of tweaks and your running. It won't over detail you!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie came out the year i was born and on the exact day which i was brought home, My father made sure to buy a copy of this movie in VHS. As you can see, this was a long time ago. Between then and now, we have moved twice and between the first change of house, the VHS was lost. My father and I were devistated. Luckily, DVD's were bearly being released and so, my father bought me a dvd for my room along with a copy of this movie. When he would come home from his first job, we would sit in the couch and watch the Lion King and laugh/ imitate the hyenas all night long. Fate once more frowned upon my family and once more we had to move. During this move, the DVD was broken in half and scratched by a lovely car. It passed unnoticed. I had also grown into those teenage years where rebellion was &#34;in&#34; and so, I didn't care weather we had this movie anymore or not. My father began working double shifts to support our family and well, our relationship grew thin. Ya know, the whole &#34;I only saw him for 30 minutes every other day&#34; kinda thing. And that went on for a long time. I graduated Highschool and started college and still, our relationship remained the same. That is, untill one thanksgiving eivning we sat down in the same couch, in the same position, and turned on the tv to see (yeah you guessed it) The Lion King.<br />Lets just say, I took a second to notice what was happening around me. My pops started snoring cause he was tired. The once Dark brown fluffy hair  was now a wisp of grey and brown poofyness on top of his head. I no longer fit snuggly between his arm, and he no longer was able to walk me on top of his feet. I got a little sentimental and looked away but that old man got me... He just said &#34;MUFASA&#34; in the loudest possible way and I once more knew that my father, my Mufasa, had returned. &#34;OH IT TINGLES&#34; was all that i replied and for that night, I was 5 years old again.<br />You don't really need me to Review this movie, you have seen it before. We all know how a great movie it is. If you are buying it, You possibly have a story like this to tell. I'm thankful for you reaching this far, but this story has dragged on long enough. I bought this movie as a gift to my father. He is turning 60 and I just entered 20. and this DVD, as meaningless as it could be to you, Means the world to me....ou have seen it before.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is actually my favorite book ever. It has already inspired me to write so much. Being a teen myself, I can actually realte to a lot in this book. Some of my friends are even depressed.This book is also my favorite to pull quotes from. Stephen Chbosky is an amazing author.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is great anyone who wants cheap fun minecraft this is the app for you. Get it before 0.7.0 comes out though it comes this month and tuere raising the price (this month is april 2013)
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Overall the book kept my interest - it was extremely predictable, in regard to the ending but overall it was entertaining and well written.  It's worth reading.
0810971496|4.0|It was fine. I have 17 more works required to finsih this review! How can they require you to use a specific number of words, on a  volentary  review. It was fine. It was fine. It was fine.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Love all of his books and have read them all more than one time.  He is by far, in my opinion, one of the best authors in the world.  His stories weave intricate plots and pull you in right from the start.  I recommend you read every book he has ever written.  I've never once been disappointed.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Read all three books from start to finish in about 2 weeks. Swedish names can be confusing, but the story is sad yet amazing.
0739384198|5.0|What a great 3rd book to the series!  Read them all.  The story telling is first rate with an interesting supenseful plot!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is the app if you want to write a book. You can also make drawings and save the drawing in the book but only one though and you can add more books whenever you want.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Yes i do recommend getting this game. It is really really fun. Multiplayer is especially fun. If you dont want blood in your game you could turn the gore option ON/OFF. So tbis game is really fun. I SERIOUSLY RECOMMEND IT.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Great trilogy I look forward to reading more of Larsson down the track. Buy it now!
B004SBBDB2|2.0|This product didn't work for me until I got a couple jailbroken apps to use it with, the ipod gets really hot when streaming netflix from it on the go and charging it. It was simple to plug in, but a hassle to take off because there is no grip and your hand slides off of it too easily.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I loved this book, it kept me glued to it. It was hard to get anything else done and it had a wonderful ending.
B00BIRRDZ4|2.0|I really loved Nothing Is Wrong but was pretty disappointed in this effort. It's a fine album, perfect for picking out khakis at the Gap or sipping lattes at Starbucks, but it's not making any best-of lists this year. Welcome to the magical genre of Adult Contemporary gents.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best but could use a few new blocks from the xbox360 version like a spawner for animals and buckets. I would definatly recommend this for people who like to unleash their inner creativity.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|This planner could be a fantastic one, except for the fact that I cannot figure out how to add both National Holidays and New Events in my life so that they show on the same day.  I will keep trying but if I cannot figure it out, I will remove it from my Kindle Fire.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This season 3 DVD deserves 5 stars because it is amazing!! This season is just as good if not better than the last 2. I sure can't wait to see season 4 next year :) I sure hope there's plenty of Thomas in the seasons to come ;)<br />I have converted over 8 people I know into Downton Abbey fans :)  -your welcome Masterpiece Classic ;)<br />Everyone that watches this show will love it!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wow!!  What a miracle.  When the details got into the medical end of it, it kind of lost me, but overall it was amazing.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|It reminded me of the book - the images on the screen matched my imagination. I loved it. I must live two more years ...
B009JZVT70|5.0|season 2 is mixing it up enough to keep us interested even after the curse was &#34;broken&#34; last season. still so much to discover!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I thought it was going to be a really good movie because of the awards it received.  Movie confused me.  Really long and boring.  I thought it would have been more about Lincoln's life as a child thru adult. The acting was brilliant, just did not like the story.  Glad I didn't waste my money in a theater!!<br />.
B008Y6QZ56|3.0|The first boxing/MMA movies I think of are Million Dollar Baby, Never Back Down, and The Fighter.  This movie is a bit of a mix between the three.  I like the concept of brothers competing against each other and once you discover more about their stories, it brings a little more depth to the movie.  It's a pretty good movie to rent but wouldn't buy it.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|I downloaded this to fix Skype video.  It worked perfectly and works as a decent camera/video recorder too.  Simple to use and offers several adjustable options ( I.e. zoom and light settings.
B008Y73940|4.0|I've heard about this movie, but never understood much about the plot.  It definitely held my interest throughout, and I'm glad I took the time to watch it.  There were a few good plot twists as well.  Enjoyed the movie and wouldn't mind watching it again.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A real page clicker! A new take on witches and vampires that is best enjoyed with a good glass of red wine.
B001KOFH2G|4.0|Fun to watch and one of the best young actresses has a leading role. Summer Glau who we loved in the tv show the Terminator played her part to perfection. The story moves fast and is action packed!
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter is a huge Monster High fan, owning many of the dolls and clothes and furniture, so this set was right up her alley! The Monster High series seems to be really popular right now, even among young teens and all of my daughter's friends were also interested in checking out this set and putting it together with their other pieces of Monster High furniture, etc. I highly recommend this for any Monster High collector!
B0031RSATC|4.0|A very sardonic and often quite fascinating revelation of the evolution of a medical practitioner through many long hours of work and uninhibited sexual behaviour.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Great movie! Loved the twist! My mouth was gaped open at the twist. And I was laughing my a** off at that scene.<br /><br />As for the quality of the DVD. U get what you paid for. I mean the case is a recyled one. I would've loved seeing the behind the scenes and gag reels. But this DVD version doesn't include them.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This is overall great app, but I want to know if I can upload my videos to YouTube. An answer would be nice. Thanks!
B006DHAT5K|3.0|Ok. The quality if the dvd is fine, movie is great. It didnt take long for me to receive it. But I didnt knw it was gpnna come from a library. The cover is not the original. Its copied. But since there are no scratches on the dvd I'm not gonna cry about it. But it should have been a little cheaper since it came from a library and doesn't have the original cover.
0307352153|5.0|No review. Five stars. I think you should accept ratings without requiring a statement. A good book deserves a rating but doesn't have to be accompanied by a blurb you can use for your convenience.
B00000FC5H|3.0|This disc has so many of the EW&F pop hits. The only problem is that the sound quality sucked all the life out of the songs. Normally I want to get up and dance, but this disc just makes me sit there. I'm hearing all these great songs, but it's like they aren't really there...no punch.<br /><br />Now on to spending another 13 dollars on another anthology I hope sounds good.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|While it retained some of the hilarity, this film felt too long. That is not something i experience often. Usually a film done well will keep you absorbed into the movie. In this case it just didn't.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Still love the movie.  Awesome music, good to relive it.  :)  I get more out of it now that I'm older.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lean In highlights the struggle that many individuals face today. Whether your a stay at home parent, working professional or some where in between the judgement we place on ourselves and on others can be a barrier to living the life we would like to be living. Being aware of your values and basing your decisions on those values is a life process for all of us. As a female I strive for valued based living. As a psychologist I support others on their own journey. Thank you for your empowering and validating message.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|When I first got this movie I was worried since I love &#34;Judge Dredd&#34; which was released not all that long ago (from my perspective) But I was VERY surprised and have to say that this is one of the best movies I have watched!! Urban does a stellar performance as Dredd and the whole plot line is much more plausible than the more futuristic one set in &#34;Jugde Dredd&#34;. I am very much hoping for a sequel!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! I really enjoyed this one. Everyone was so enthused with the story line, so I figured I jump on the Christian Grey train too lol and I'm happy I did. Loved it :)
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a very cute kids movie and was a perfect gift for my neice and nephew who each have 2 children of their own now. Gotta try to find them a little something besides sweets.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Okay, so this book was great as well. However, the ending confused me a little bit... idk, maybe it's just me... but either way, the rest of the book up until th  very ending was great.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Wow.  What a movie.  My heart was in my mouth.  And it was based on a true story.  Talk about strength, endurance and just downright courage!  Can you tell I love this movie.  I don't tell the details as I found out it spoils it for me, but I do tell what I thought, and felt about a movie.  This is a movie the whole family (over the age of 8) can watch. The acting makes you feel as though you're there with them.  It's suspenseful to say the least.  I couldn't recommend this movie more.  A definitely buy for my DVD collection.  Just a great movie to watch.  I highly recommend it.
B00821PCJS|5.0|To me it anything sci-fi, fantasy, magic or anything else like that I love. So it would be hard for me to give this a bad rating. The plot as usual follows many of the previous invasion plots. The actors and characters do a good job and after watching a few episodes feel comfortable. I think the special effects  are great as it makes up at least 50% of the movie. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series.
B0035G0U2O|5.0|What can I say but that I enjoyed this movie so much I have it in my Amazon On Line collection of movies.  I really enjoy it.  For a Friday or Saturday night movie with the kids (over 6) this action movie is great!
B00B47NO2O|3.0|This is a good nail biter kind of show with twists and turns, but they make the FBI, and all law enforcement, seem like idiots.  They are always splitting up when searching places where the suspects are supposedly hiding.  And shocker, some of them always end up getting killed or kidnapped.  Somehow, the suspects always seem to escape, typically due to a lack of manpower.  Seriously, if there was a cult of serial killers, do you think the Feds would send less than 100 agents to take them down?  Of course not, they'd send hundreds, if not thousands.<br /><br />My wife and I find ourselves often guessing the plot before it happens whenever someone splits up or the suspects start running away.  So I guess you could say it's predictable given the way the plot has gone so far.  However, they do throw some good twists and turns in every now and again to throw you off.  I just wish it was a little more believable.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I've been watching a lot of the movies that have come out lately and this ranks as one of my favorites.  I just loved it.  Acting was great.  Fight scenes were fabulous, and just a good shoot-em up and action movie.  I watched it twice and to me it's worth buying and keeping in my DVD collection.  For a Friday or Saturday night it's a great movie to watch.  But warning, don't let anyone under the age of 16 watch this movie as it's got quite a bit of violence in it.  And yes, I'm a mother of 2 sons.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|great quality picture and sound and I recommend it for the true fan of this film  cant beat the price
B009GX6600|5.0|Arguably the best yet, if you are a fan of the show season ten will not disappoint. I would definitely recommend it!
B004LWZW4W|4.0|nice quality dvd and the movie isn't too bad  I prefer the originals  but you do get a good story and the actors do a good job with the material
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!  I think this game is really fun!! I love how you can get mystery boxes throughout the game and I really like when you can use the jetpack to get coins up high! I love the characters too! They are really cool looking...  This app is great! I completley recommend this...  PLUS ITS FREE!!!
B001EYGOG0|5.0|Tony Bennett has lovely music.  The music is absolutely beautiful!  I really love  his songs and the musicians are absolutely wonderful.  Wow!  Tony Bennett has some really nice music!
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I remember when I first saw this in the theater. It's still flooded with romance, intrigue, engaging plots, and enduring illusions. Always makes me wish I could mold my own life according to the illusion I desire. If you haven't seen it yet, take a look. Discover.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is way better than the normal and most borring temple run. I got this game a long time ago and I am still playing it a lot! It is definitely an awesome game! It is totally worth the 99 cents! I definitely recommend it!
B004IK8Q86|4.0|The characters in &#34;The Razor's Edge&#34; are hardly edgy. From the start, they are consistent and mimic Maugham's cynical perception of wealth, beauty, existentialism, and the self-destructive nature of the human beast. An intriguing read but, if I had to choose, of course my favorite would still be, &#34;Of Human Bondage.&#34;
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|The Master is back,  Jeffrey Archer is on of the greatest story tellers ever.  In this third book of the Clifton Chronicles he leaves us hanging on for the next edition......
B004MC8CA2|1.0|Couldn't figure out how to navigate or find chapters and verses. It is as if I had to read the Bible like any other book, from start to finish. If that's your goal, then you might enjoy this app. I was hoping for a more versatile approach as if I actually had a Bible with me and could access chapter and verse as desired. Downside of apps is that they don't come with instructions.
0143106651|1.0|i chose to pay a little bit more to get a cover of the book that i liked and a version that was well kept.  the book i recieved was in very poor shape.  the cover had many wrinkles, rips and tears in it.  and it was not the cover that was advertised.  i am HIGHLY dissapointed in this purchase and will not use this seller ever again.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book,a bit frightning at times.<br />the main character was sweet but also terrifing at times,,a really good read !!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Why would anyone choose wool for a title?  I got a sample to find out what it was about.  I then bought the book to find out how it ended.  I couldn't put it down.  Really glad I read it.  Leaves you with something to think about afterwards too.  Wow what a situation.  Truly hope it never happens!
B0068THAGY|3.0|Teenagers fall in love; teenagers have adventure with monster you never see until the end of the movie and even then, only briefly; a sci-fi for the kids, but entertaining.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Not too bad ... Not too bad at all ... Everyone said this movie was bad but I have read all of the Reacher books and still managed to enjoy this movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|sat up all night just to finish the game. very addictive. can't wait for the next one! soon I hope!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Its grreat and ease to use.. it pretty much gets u out of a jam when u need a calculator....
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I thought this book sort of started out a little slow and not like my usual mystery books I've been reading, but it got very interesting as I read more of the book and ended being a pretty good story. Different but good.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Good book and gripping, from beginning  till end. Enjoyed it very much. Was very surprising the way it ended. Surprise indeed.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Love this book! Perfect combination of love, self improvement, family and friends!!.. Describes what is life all about. Like Like!
B008602KQI|5.0|I never generally watch this kind of movies. But I am glad I did.good acting,superb presentation. Great acting by Jennifer Lawrence.Recommend it very much.
B00BJDARGO|2.0|I agree with the other reviewers.. this is half a product... and should be half the price.  If I were Coverdale, I would have been embarrased to put this product on the market without filling it up with more content and better quality.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is the best rap album to come along in a long time. Macklemore is a master lyricist. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis' collaboration is magical.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better.  I really miss having a Star Trek series of one kind or another, so I've been watching all the &#34;others&#34;.  Deep Space Nine and now Enterprise.  I've enjoyed both series immensely.
1449410243|5.0|I am a crazy cat lady so I may just be partial to this book. But the first time I read the Oatmeal and found the animal/cat comics I was dying. This book is a great testament to that. It's funny, fun, truthful and simply great! Go check out the oatmeal website and if that's your sense of humor then definitely buy this book.
079073639X|4.0|Not up with the best of them, not very credible, no fireworks or current marvels of imagery, pretty skimpy on hardware...but I found it entertaining.<br />Save for the big name stars, this is a B  picture; but, what's in a category. I would have thought this confused and confusing undersea adventure would have left me cold, but it did not. I will not try to unravel the plot for you. It's better if you just let it come and, at the end, accept the explanation and resolution as given.<br />I should think this will be better received by non-science-fiction devotees who are accustomed these days to much more elaborate pseudo-science and scientific jargon. This is simple, here's what happened, believe it; this is why it happened, accept it.<br />If you are put off by the ratings given on this Amazon site, there is always the path of not seeing the film.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Amazing Cd.  The music is mesmerizing. I listen in the car when on my way home from work and it soothes the angst I have due to traffic.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a recommended read for sure. Follett outdid himself on this one. I hope he doesn't keep us waiting too long for the third book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw this group on a PBS special and fell in love with their music so I purchased the CD. Amazing and beautiful music.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I gave this pack of wall decals 5 stars because its alot of bang for your buck, a ton of princesses and little stickers, really transformed my 3 yr old princess' room, she loves it!  They apply easily and can be moved and re-applied just as easily, and there's no damage to your wall, that's the best part. Once she outgrows this, just remove, and done.  Quickly delivered, great transaction :)
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Good game. Entertaining and creative. It is a battery killer though. Also needs more ways to get gold medals without spending money.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is very impressive. Reminds me of a contained Myst game. You solve puzzle boxes that are elaborately designed, challenging enough to be fun, but not impossible to solve on your own. It also gives timed hints. (My own hint for you: some puzzles use the tilt sensor.) Works smoothly on my Kindle fire HD (be patient, it takes more than a few seconds to load the puzzle.)and the graphics are very nice. Worth buying. On a final note, thanks to Fireproof games, I have been craving a smart creative game.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I am in love with this game!! It gives you the thrill of going to new places and the experience of being a shark!!!!  I SO encourage u to get it!!!!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I have been very impressed with the highly gifted and talented cast and their acting; the excellent, well-written, creative stories; and the development of both the stories and characters in Merlin.  Merlin has been a remarkable 5-season series; one that is rare:  meaningful and entertaining at the same time.<br /><br />Having said this and consistently given the show a 5-star rating, I was troubled by the seemingly abrupt, empty ending of the series.  In each and every episode, we are introduced with \\"In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy/man.\\"  At the end, however, we are kind of left wondering if all of this has been for nothing.  What has been accomplished?  What destiny has been fulfilled?  The foretold death of X by Y?  What happens now?  True, evil and evil sorcery have been greatly diminished, but...<br /><br />On another note:  Does anyone else find it strange that every magician on the series seemed to know how to teleport themselves to another location except for Merlin?
B007WKEM8C|5.0|I am getting new ideas from Deb Perelman in this book.<br />I like her casual and creative style and thinking about cooking.<br />I bought Julia Childs' books, but that is way too much perfection for me.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I bought the movie for my Grandchildren and they loved it it was funny colorful and had excellent storyline, I actually bought two
B005R2N20Q|5.0|This soothing music is perfect to wind down from stress.<br />Deva's voice is innocently beautiful and joy inducing.<br />Deva, not the news!
B009X01ELC|5.0|The case works very well with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9. I was pleasantly surprised that it apparently has a magnet that turns the Kindle on when it's opened, and turns if off on closing.  The swivel is a little stiff, but that keeps it from turning unintentionally. All in all, a nice addition.
B00114LF4E|5.0|Four of the albums contained in this set first saw the light of day in the United States on the RCA Soria Series albums -- surely the most beautifully packages LP's there ever were !!  Each LP was presented in a linen bonded album cover with gold-leaf printing.  The  packaging was gorgeous, the playing was gorgeous, and the annotations were well written and were beautifully printed -- we'll never see the likes of any of that again.<br /><br />They (the Brahms, the Beethoven, the Mozart 40th, the Haydn 104th, and the Strauss items) were released as Living Stereo and had such care lavished on them in production in celebration of the tour by Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic which took place during the Fall of 1959.  I collected the albums back then as a young teenager.  But one of the great musical pities of my life was that I had the chance to see them in concert and did not take advantage of that opportunity.<br /><br />But these recordings still stand up as some of the most beautiful of their era.  This was during the period when Time magazine declared Karajan to be the \\"General Music Director of Europe\\" -- which in fact he was -- sorta -- since he was engaged by the Berliner Philharmoniker, the Wiener Philharmoniker, and La Scala all simultaneously.  I know of no other conductor before or since who had THAT kind of exposure.<br /><br />To paraphrase Kipling, those were \\"high and far off times\\" -- and the recordings are a great souvenir of the era.  Warmly recommended.
B008Y73940|4.0|Excellent film with very good acting from a solid cast.  Drama and intrigue with an interesting ending. Well worth seeing more than once.
0307744434|1.0|I hated this book. I hated it mostly because it promised to take me into a world of enchantment, and it did not keep that promise.<br />Also, the writing is clumsy and amateurish. The characters are one-dimensional, and the plot is non-existent. I finished it thinking that something might happen, but nothing did. This book got an awful lot of hype and raving reviews. Don't know why.<br />I'm glad I borrowed it from the library and didn't buy it.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|The storyline has been adequately covered by other reviewers. This is a great horror film that produced so many screams as we were watching it. Great acting, good story, no dead space, incredible special effects. The final scene is superb---it ties everything together.I gave it FIVE stars but I wish there were more to give!  A masterpiece of horror film-making.
0782008364|5.0|i would recommend this movie to anyone who is over the impulse of easy money. it is super sexy and and contributed directly to my delinquency as an impulsive young woman.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Aftermath of Katniss and Peeta winning the 74th Hunger Games. Keeps you wanting more. Slow at times but well worth the wait/read.
0071752854|5.0|If you are tired of reading all the sales stuff that you know just will not work in the real world... give this your full attention. As a physician who has studied neurology I enjoyed how Oren explains the \\"real\\" brain based wiring to closing a sale. As I allowed him to take me through the process I realized I was doing everything wrong in how I was presenting and processing my elective services to potential patients. In the past I have found that the tradition advice of, just knock on more doors was nonsense, Oren lays down a completely new approach that will help anyone from show salesman to plastic surgeon that wants to increase their bottom line. Read the book a few times, make notes and design your whole approach. You will end up being in total control and will never experience that horrible feeling of having the person you are trying to pitch to make you feel like a loser. Refreshing, advanced new approach not just a rehash of old ineffective ideas. Buy a hardcover because you will be tearing through the pages for hundreds of hours. -Dr.SS
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This movie is family fun. A movie that causes laughs and smiles for the whole family. Great movie for a family night, getting all the kids together to have fun.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|after the last update I am unable to open it at all! I was on level 75 and I really don't want to reload it and start all over...
0920668372|5.0|a must in all homes. I read this book to my children while growing up and now they all have it for there children
B007IXWKUK|5.0|If you liked the first book this one is even better! Would recommend this book!  Not meant for younger readers.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|Blackberry Smoke is really growing on me.  I saw these guys live w/ Brantley Gilbert and Eric Church.  I'd go see them in concert anytime they're around!
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this book. I did not see the movie, so maybe that was good. It has many twists and turns, and makes you want more.
B00BS4RGFE|5.0|Country music is killing it with in the last month or so.  Every song hits home on this CD.  He is such a great artist!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Love Dan Brown books.  Another good book by him.  The Robert Langdon series is the best series for all books.
B0089IGUP4|5.0|The album is great and the condition is arrived in was perfect. Basically new for a not so new price. Shopping for music anywhere else is a waste of time and gas if you have a local used media store in your town/city, forget about it. It's pointless when Amazon has everything at your fingertips in guaranteed conditions.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|WOW! I'd tell myself \\"One more chapter, then I will fold the laundry\\", 5 chapters later it still wasn't done! I just couldn't put the book down! Finished the book in one day! It had your emotions all over the place. When they were devastated, you literally felt their devastation in the pit of your own stomach. When they were intimate, your entire body reacted w/them. When Holder was being stupid, you wanted to run up and slap him! Definitely a must read!!!
B000SFJWLU|4.0|Great product conditions. Great album. What more can one ask for in a shopping experience? I'm sure you can find something to gripe about but guess what? I'm not listening to you. I'm listening to this awesome album I bought for super cheap.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The show continues to keep you coming back for more. You really begin to feel a part of the family of characters.
