B000066NW0|5.0|First off all Canadian artists are good. Secondly all girl artists are awsome. Ecspecially the ones who write their own music and play an instrument. And lastly you gotta love girls who are bold enough to wear what they want and don't care about what other people think. Now Avril fits into all of these catagories so that makes her like better than awsome. So buy her debut CD Let Go.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne rules the rock world!!! She's beautiful. She plays the guitar. She skateboards.

B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate SG-1 remains the best written SF show on television today, bar none.  It has a wit, intelligence, consistency, and style all it's own.  Season 2 picked up right where Season 1 left off, and continued to expand the universe of SG1.  SF Fans, I urge you to view this series.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril has an amazing voice but that's not all of it.  She sings with energy and actully puts effort into her music. She's fun and creative and her songs make sense. Avril has a thing with punk making chick rock much better.  That's more than i can say for some singers.  I got her CD the first day it came out and I haven' taken it out of my CD player yet.  She uses really easy cords so for those of you who play guitar(like me), you can play along.
0684853523|5.0|I just finished this book today.  If you are an aspiring writer I highly recommend it.  Even if you are not an aspiring writer, you'll enjoy King's early childhood and life reminiscences, and his recalling his horrible run-in with the infamous van and rottweiler.<br />I have to admit this is the first Stephen King book I have ever read.  I have wanted to be a published writer since I was a little girl, and Mr. King offers up some valuable tips and advice.<br />In closing I want to add that I am very impressed with the marriage between Mr. King and his wife, Tabitha.  She was always supportive of his desire to write, and I'm sure she is a major reason he became the success he did.  His love and admiration for her is apparent throughout this book.
B000002KKX|5.0|It would be easy enough to dismiss the work of Christopher Cross as easy listening pap, were it not that his songs are so haunting and artfully constructed. With this, his wildly successful debut album, Cross seemed to have come out of nowhere. Here was a balding unknown with a pleasant but not a super voice (did he ever have to tour?)who somehow landed a contract with Warner Bros., was given a competent producer and a decent amount of money, and proceeded to put out an album of mellow, moody, memorable songs for a reasonably mature audience, in an age when disco and punk were still the rulers of the two major camps who thought themselves hip. Suddenly his music was unavoidable, winning four grammies and airplay galore. Who could have guessed? But the quality is there. Songs like &quot;Poor Shirley&quot; have melodies that will stay with you; in fact, there isn't a song on this album from which snatches of melody won't haunt you for days. To me, the more remarkable fact is that listening to it all these years later, the songs still hold up. Easy listening? Perhaps, but far from background music. Cross was just a guy who knew how to make a good record.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Yeah, yeah, yeah, you've probably had it drilled into you by your parents and or grandparents that The Beatles are the greatest band in history, changed the face of music, brilliant, yadayadayada.<br />So what.<br />They haven't had a really new track since at least twenty years before you were born. How can you possibly relate to them?<br />Surprisingly, it is possible. There are bands out there right now that have made an entire career out of following one trend or another in the Beatles short career. (Remember: These 20 #1 songs came out over a period of six years. That's about the same career length as Backstreet Boys.)<br />Here's the closest modern equivalent artists I can think of for these songs. If that act covered this Beatle song, it wouldn't sound too far out of place. If you like the band I mention, chances are you'll like the Beatles track too.<br />1. Love Me Do<br />2. From Me to You<br />- Definite boyband/3-part harmony soft rockers. Closest modern equivalent: 98 degrees, Boys II Men.<br />3. She Loves You<br />4. I Want to Hold Your Hand<br />- Straight ahead guitar driven rockers. CME: The Hives, The Strokes.<br />5. Can't Buy Me Love<br />6. A Hard Day's Night<br />7. I Feel Fine<br />8. Eight Days a Week<br />- Back to the boyband harmonies but with a edgier feel. We're in BSB/NSync territory, but with lyrics written by someone who's first language is English.<br />9. Ticket to Ride<br />- Pearl Jam on lithium. Upset but not too upset, y'know.<br />10. Help!<br />- Same kind of spirit as emo-punkers like Blink 182 or New Found Glory<br />11. Yesterday<br />- similar to the lighter softer Smashing Pumpkins, ie Disarm<br />12. Day Tripper<br />13. We Can Work It Out<br />14. Paperback Writer<br />- Oasis, definitely Oasis<br />15. Yellow Submarine<br />16. Eleanor Rigby<br />- sound effects, bizzarre instrumentation. Sort of a primitive Moby meets Fatboy Slim<br />17. Penny Lane<br />18. All You Need Is Love<br />- Hard to find a modern equivalent. Perhaps Drops of Jupiter by Train, in that both have that same orchestral element.<br />19. Hello Goodbye<br />20. Lady Madonna<br />- back to pure silly but fun pop. Smash Mouth or Sugar Ray could comfortably cover these songs.<br />21. Hey Jude<br />- now we're in Celine territory<br />22. Get Back<br />23. The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko<br />- the first could be an uptempo U2 tune, the 2nd a slightly less uptempo U2 tune<br />24. Something<br />- mushy but classy. What Alicia Keys might have written 30 years ago.<br />25. Come Together<br />- Aerosmith. Old Aerosmith, when they rocked.<br />26. Let It Be<br />- same tempo as Coldplay's Yellow.<br />27. The Long and Winding Road<br />- just a nice gentle ballad, something Faith Hill could do a nice job on.<br />Yes, one band covered all these genres. And did them well, which is definitely a big part of why they are so loved. If you didn't like one track by them, there were several other which you could like. You never knew what they'd do next.<br />So will you like the whole album? Probably not.<br />Will you find at least one track you love? Well, assuming you listen to more than just gangsta rap, odds are good. Very good., in that both have that same orchestral element.<br />19. Hello Goodbye<BR>20. Lady Madonna<BR>- back to pure silly but fun pop. Smash Mouth or Sugar Ray could comfortably cover these songs.<br />21. Hey Jude<BR>- now we're in Celine territory<br />22. Get Back<BR>23.

B00005N9CV|4.0|...i was recently riding in the car with my husband and his cousin, Brian, and we decided to ride around town and visit relatives for the afternoon. Brian was all geared up for our day by bringing a whole case of cds, and we were listening to all kinds of music.  I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised that, when i popped this cd in, nobody but me was really feelin it. That's okay, though...my feelings aren't TOO hurt...this is just some really good mellow listening...very relaxing, and... well... I just like it....i wasn't always so partial to this kind of music, though...i've had some substantial influence from this really great poet i know who has some pretty intelligent musical tastes, too (hint, hint you over there in Louisville...ahem)...anyway, I guess it is an acquired taste, as is much of the really GOOD music that's out there...i may spread my wings a bit more over time (i'm sure i will)...right now, just takin it a step at a time...but enjoying the journey...
B000060OFT|5.0|I am tired of folks saying things like Shakespeare would roll in his grave over this film etc etc etc.<BR>Umm folks Shakespeare was not considered the greatest writer of his time, he was in many ways the George Lucas of the Elizabethan era. His writing was for the enjoyment of the rich and the poor and it was not to be taken as seriously as so many take it today!<BR>So stop acting as if he was this great icon of his time, he was an actor who started writing and I truly believe he would appreciate Baz's version of his play. The way Baz takes the play out of it's classical scene and places it in the modern day and still keeps the beauty of the story intact is simply thrilling.<BR>The way the two houses are protrayed as modern day mafia-like gangs with their rumbles and fights and the pistols given the names of the classical swords that would be used in a more period version was very smart and inventive.<BR>Claire Danes is a stunning Juliet and Leo does an excellent job as Romeo. No I'm not a Leo fan but I think he gets to bad a rap simply because he was such a fad for awhile there. John Leguizamo is a marvelously slimy Tibalt. The actor play Mercutio has a particularly intersting roll and the way Baz twists the end of the play ever so slightly makes this almost a whole new piece.<BR>The music is stunning, if there is anything wrong with this film it is that it was very loud in the theaters and gave me a headache a couple of times, but we all have volume buttons at home so that is not a problem here.<BR>So what are you waiting for?
B000066NW0|5.0|This is the ABSOLUTE best CD i've ever heard.  Avril Lavigne has a great voice and a great style.  She has a unique sound that ranges from slower light songs to upbeat punk rock songs, and the mix between them is amazing! The album starts off with a song called Losing Grip, its about being in a relationship with someone who doesn't really care about you.  This is a deep, angry song with an important meaning.  The next song is the first single called Complicated.  Its about someone who tries to be someone else, and it causes problems in the relationship.  Sk8er Boi is about the stereotypes involved in dating and ending up with the wrong person in the end.  Its a punkier song and has a great beat.  The next song, I'm With You, is about being lonely and wanting someone, anyone, to comfort you.  Mobile is about how Avril's life has changed from a small-town girl to a superstar and how she's always having to go somewhere else.  The song Unwanted is about having someone you love push you away, this has a very strong sound to it.  Tomorrow is about not trusting someone, and maybe after a little more time things will change, maybe tomorrow.  Next, Anything But Ordinary, is a great song about being yourself, doing what you want to do, and not letting anyone change that.  Things I'll Never Say is about loving someone, but at the same time, being afraid to tell them that you love them.  My World tells the listener a little bit about Avril that they probably wouldn't know otherwise.  She describes what it's like to be her; this is one of my favorites, although there isn't one song i don't like on this album.  Nobody's Fool is another song about being yourself and not letting anyone change that.  The song Too Much To Ask is about someone who is obssessed with themselves and only cares about being the best; this has a deep meaning too.  The last song, Naked, is about feeling unprotected around someone you love.  You feel like they can see through you and know exactly who you really are.  That's it for Avril's debut CD, \\"Let Go\\", it really is a great collection of songs and is enjoyable for all different people.  This girl is an amazing artist and will be a big influence in the music industry; hopefully, for a long time.  Rock on Avril!
B00000JMQD|4.0|The Wizard of Oz is one of my favorite movies and even though Return to Oz is so completely different with a much darker plot and some rather creepy elements it is a good movie that has gotten a bad rap from critics and by people who keep comparing it to the Wizard of Oz and I think if they gave this movie a chance and stopped comparing it to that 1939 classic they would see that this is a very entertaining movie and they might actually have to admit that it isn't the awful movie they are trying to make everyone think it is. Judy Garland may be my favorite Dorothy but I think the cute as a button Fairuza Balk did a very good job and I was satisfied with her performance!
B000021Y7X|5.0|Well I first saw the movie Stop Making Sense in 1983or 1984 in Greenwich Village NY.  It was the most electric rock concert movie I had ever seen.  I recently rented it on  DVD.  Amazing...still electric after 19 years.   The Heads had the right chemistry--of course David is one of those rare talents that just light up the music.  I hadnt noticed that, in addition to being one of the most brilliant performers to grace a rock stage, he is also a pretty good guitar player.  Fave song?  Home--still fresh.  Also, you can let your kids watch this DVD--theres nothing really objectionable about it.  Its pure energy.
B00005A1PR|5.0|THIS CD BY INDIA ARIE...ACOUSTIC SOUL, IS A GREAT CD TO OWN IN YOUR COLLECTION. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SIT-BACK AND LISTEN TO HER SOUL-SOUNDS AND RELAX.
B00005YXZH|5.0|\\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" is first rock/pop masterpiece of the millenium. Yes, unlike earlier Wilco and Uncle Tupelo, it is filled with funny noises and odd bits of electronica, but yikes, look at how much the Beatles changed from \\"Hard Days' Night\\" to the \\"White Album.\\" The whole point of a band and of making albums is to grow into new sounds and experiment a bit, and here Wilco does an amazing job of doing that.<br />It does take a bit of getting used to, but by no means would I consider this an avant-garde or even very experimental album.  Bands have used static and feedback in songs for years and years, but here it is refined and punctuates the emotion of the songs.  Much of the album is very catchy and pop/rock, like \\"Kamera,\\" \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You,\\" and of course \\"Heavy Metal Drummer.\\" Others are much slower and atmospheric, such as \\"Poor Places\\" and the opening track.<br />I think the point of all the noise comes from the title, which is code used in radio communications. (You actually hear a woman repeating the title several times in the static before the last song.) Wilco is trying to communicate something here, something very important. I think everyone, especially given the events of last September, can relate to the mix of sadness, anger, humor, and hope that fills this wonderful album. Give it a try. It'll become one of your favorites.
B000066NW0|4.0|Dear whoever and what not, <BR>aghhhhh really nervous so here goes!<br />   As i have discovered, Avil Lavigne is anything but ordinary. She demonstrates her skater-punk, dinamic spirit, and wildness in her first album, &quot;Let Go&quot;. With Avril's singing and writing talents, i couldn't be happier, because her music is what i have anticipated for some time. I may not have to CD yet, but don't get mad! I'm getting it as soon as another 20 rolls in:D<br />   My favourite song would most definitely be, &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;. This song is my anthem, i love it! It's very beautifully written, with an abundance of raw emotion and reality that motivates me to be happy, even when i've dug myself into the bottom of the deepest hole. Another song i enjoy very much, almost as much as &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, would be &quot;I'm With You&quot;. This song is also one of my favourites beause it reminds me that i'm only human, and that i need comfort and support from others. It also helps me cope with mixed feelings inside, encouraging me to let them out and stop hiding them from the ones who care about me.<br />   All in all, Avril's music had dazzled me! Whenever i'm at my pal's house, who has the CD (grrr) i enjoy listening to it. I try to remeber as much as i can, or i'm stuck singing 5 words of each song when i get home:D I also play the guitar, and as well i do find it to be my personal therapist...his name is Stewart, and he's really old! But my daddy gave him too me so i love him very much:D I could see us jamming together at my 90th birthday.<br />  In conclusion to my lengthy email, i will state that Avril's new Cd, &quot;Let Go&quot;, is anything but ordinary! That's why i love it! All of the songs are well written, with lots of thought and feeling...very creative! I like! It's easy to relate to...which is odd because the mind of a teenager is very complex. Avril demonstrates her capability to touch on the parts of a teenage mind in her songs, which is comforting and energizing all at once:) What else?Hmm....Avril is certainly a positive influence on her fans. Not only does she display a real and loving personality, but she's also honest and fun. If people where as real as her, life would make so much more sense. I dislike plastic people very much so.<br />There u go! That's all for now i guess.<BR>BYE:D
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is young, beautiful, crazy(the good kind), confident and last but not least, talented.  Only 17, the singer/songwriter/guitarist is anything, but typical.  She's a refreshing new artist on the alternative rock scene, out with her debut album &quot;Let Go&quot;, which is sweeping the nation.<br />Clearly confident and definately anti-ulterior, with a &quot;just be who you are&quot; attiude in the more upbeat songs &quot;Complicated&quot; about her being irritated at someone not being able to act the way they are and with &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; about a girl not being with a skater boy because of pressures from her friends, then he makes it big and she suddenly realizes her mistake, but is rejected.  In &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, she certainly destroys any hope of ever changing her with pressure and in &quot;Losing My Grip&quot; which sounds a lot heavier than the other three,  she talks about facing the world alone, because her boyfriend just hasn't been there for her.<br />And then there's &quot;Unwanted&quot;, my personal favorite, which is a bit angry and is where she refuses to be ignored and demands attention.  With an album like this, I would say ignoring her would be quite impossible.<br />There are her fast and optimistic songs, &quot;Mobile&quot;,&quot;My World&quot;, &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; which is her talking about all the things she wants with this boy, but would never tell him like Marry me today/Yes I'm wishing myself away/With these things I'll never say.<br />Then there are the softer lighter melodies in &quot;Naked&quot;,&quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; (with interesting back of vocals),&quot;Too Much To Ask&quot; and &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; that sounds like out cry for help from someone wanting, no, needing to be different and of course she has no doubtedly accomplished it.

0446677450|5.0|...to read Rich and Poor Dad was a good experience because increase my knowledge about money in great form.<BR>One thing that I like is how Kiyosaki to explain to me why the people fall in \\"Rate race.\\" Before I red, I know about that, but I never had had an explanation about why people works very hard and they continue with serious economics problems. This people when they have a good job immediately, buy an expensive house and unnecessary things consequently their liabilities increase.<BR> Kiyosaki teach how the money works, he said that first, we to study about finances and participate in seminaries or courses. Knowledge is great inversion, because we can learn how to go out from \\" Rat Race\\".<BR> Another important thing that Kiyosaki teach is \\" Take Action\\". We invest money and time for learning a lot of thing about money, and is not wise don't take action and put in practice our knowledge.<BR> In conclusion I agree with \\"Rich Dad and Poor Dad\\" because a found a very good things that help me and other people to take good decisions about how can be use the money and have a good time in this life.
6303471714|5.0|For anyone thinking about purchasing this video. I highly recommend it. I do believe it is not for the beginner and should be combined with a cardio work out and low fat diet for best results.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut c.d., Let Go, was released on June 4th. She worked on it until it totally represented her. When I bought the c.d., I didn't think the c.d. would be so fantastic. Let Go is awesome and it's my new favorite c.d. The c.d. has a lot of songs everyone can relate to.All of the lyrics and music are absolutely awesome! I could listen to Let Go over and over and over again! Here's a brief description of the songs:<br />Losing grip: This song starts out slow, then it goes full out into an angry chick rock song. This song is really awesome. Avril is singing about how she was used and is now alone. I love to listen to this song when I've been betrayed by someone, it captures my feelings almost perfectly.<br />Complicated: Complicated is Avril's first single and also a good choice. This song and sk8er boi are the only ones with a lot of pop in them, and these songs are still rock songs. Complicated is about someone not be real or who they actually are. The person is pretending to be someone they're not. Avril is asking that person why they've got to be that way, they should just be theirself.<br />Sk8er Boi: This is a cute song, also with a lesson hidden in it. The lesson is don't let anyone tell you to not do something, you shouldn't let anyone hold you back from what you want. You may later regret it. Sk8er Boi is about a girl and a guy liking each other, except they are of different social classes. The guy, the sk8er boi, doesn't care. But the girl's friends don't approve of him so she doesn't go out with him. Later in life she regrets her decision. This song is still fun to listen to because the sk8er boi is with Avril!! <br />I'm With You: Avril sings about being deserted in this song, which we can all relate to at some point. She's so confused about things but she just needs someone to come and take her away from this crazy life. I'm With you is a really deep song, I love listening to it.<br />Mobile: Mobile is about everything in life changing so fast, without your control. Sometimes the changes are just too much, that you want to scream out loud.<br />Unwanted: I love this song, this is one I always want to listen to because I can relate. Avril wants to know somebody but that person just doesn't want to get to know who the real Avril is. He doesn't even know her and he pushing her away and dissing her. <br />Tomorrow: Tomorrow, which was on the Felicity series finale, is a nice slow song. Avril sings that she doesn't know how she can trust this person when nothing that comes out of their mouth is true. She says tomorrow's a new day, maybe I believe you then. <br />Anything but Ordinary: I really, really like this song. The lyrics are like nothing you've heard before. She sings about not being ordinary and all of her not-so-ordinary habits and thoughts. The chorus is really deep. I can relate to the lyrics of this song too, especially the first verse, where she admits she laughs herself to sleep as a lullaby. But Avril would rather not live a normal, ordinary life. She'd rather be anything but ordinary in life, instead of wasting it. <br />Things I'll Never Say: Anybody who has a crush on a boy who makes them all nervous inside will relate to this song. Avril sings about trying to be perfect for the boy because he's worth it. She sings about wishing she could say everything she feels to him, but the words just won't come out. We all have those things we'll never say.<br />My World: My World is about Avril's small hometown, Napanee. This song pretty much sums up small town life. <br />Nobody's Fool: Avril is like rapping this song. Nobody's Fool is about being your self and not ever changing for anyone. You've got to be you!<br />Too Much To Ask: This song is about being with a guy until he stops caring. The guy turns out to be like all the rest and stops being fun when he starts worrying about being cool. Is it too much to ask for a guy to be real?<br />Naked: this song is about when you're in love, your protective shield comes down. Avril sings about how she tried to hide her real self, so she wouldn't get hurt in a relationship. Her plan failed when this guy came around and found the real Avril. But it feels good for AVril, to let her guy see the real her. <br />There are also two bonus on the c.d. that you have to find by putting the c.d. in your computer.
0452282152|4.0|This is an interesting book written about the Dutch artist, Johannes Vermeer. Very little is known about Vermeer. One of his most famous paintings, &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring,&quot; is both engaging and mysterious, not unlike the Mona Lisa. This is a fictional account of the possible origins of the girl in the painting. Taking what little is known about Vermeer and adding some history of Delft during the 1600's the author seamlessly weaves a story about the girl in the painting. This is a story of class differences, of romance and of a young woman's coming of age.16-year-old Griet goes to work as a maid in Vermeer's household after her father is blinded in an explosion and can no longer support the family. She is expected to know her place, which is well below the others in the household. As she expresses an interest in his work, Vermeer allows her to learn from him and to help him, and Griet finds herself being drawn to him. Meanwhile the butcher's son takes an interest in her, and her family encourages her relationship with him because he will be able to provide them with meat in their poverty-stricken circumstances.This book is very well-written, with every character and relationship carefully thought out, including Vermeer's selfish and demanding wife and his manipulative and scheming daughter. I really enjoyed the story and found myself thinking about it when I wasn't reading it.I rate this book at 4.5 out of 5 stars.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is one of the most moving albums I have ever listened to. It is so powerful that I felt as if Avril was speaking to me directly. Avril Lavigne is one of the best musicians I have ever heard.I would highly recommend this album to anyone who has or had some chaos in their life. This album is so powerful and it really reaches out to the girls. But, the boys aren't left out. Boys would like this album too.
B000066NW0|5.0|What's Up everyone. It's gonna be hard to express Avril Lavigne in a 1,000 words but I'll try. She is one of the hottest songwriters in the world today. Her lyrics are based on her real life experiences and if you listen to it you could definitely tell. So you better listen and buy the cd, all the kids are doing it. Napanee, Ontario is where she is from and it is mentioned in one of her songs, #10 My World. <BR>   Not only is Avril Lavigne talented but she has a band with 3 hot guys. If you look in the cd you will find there pictures and also lyrics of all 13 songs. Yes there are 13 songs and they are great as a matter of fact. <BR>   The one thing everyone is trying to do is to be someone else, ya know follow the crowd. Avril Lavigne is one of the few people in the music buisness that doesn't want to be like everyone else, but just herself. It definitely reflects her music and it will definitely reflect other people's lives. <BR>   So one word of advice, just buy the damn cd and you will be very satisfied. <br />Thank You.
B000000W6R|5.0|The Pumpkins have been my favorite rock band ever since I heard \\"cherub rock\\",their first single from the Siamese Dream album back in '93. Ever since I've been hooked on their unique brand of heavy, overdriven guitar rock, interspersed with some of the most beautiful softer songs(which only accentuate the harder ones even more). This band just has a unique sound that I think can mainly be attributed to the songwriting of Billy Corgan, of whom I believe is one of the best songwriters/guitarists ever, although guitarist James Iha throws in the occasional gem as well.  In my opinion, Pisces Iscariot showcases the true power of this band in their peak, and I think it's definitely a companion piece to Siamese Dream, seeing that most of the songs on Pisces are Siamese Dream outtakes or b-sides to the UK cd single releases. This album is my favorite album of Pumpkins material, and it's really odd because these songs are considered b-sides. I think that the fact that this collection of songs is considered \\"second rate\\" or \\"outtake\\" material is a testament to the amazing skill and songwriting of this band. These songs move from really soft acoustic(\\"soothe\\") on to more tripped out, mellow psychedelic numbers \\"obscured\\", \\"spaced\\", \\"la dolly vita\\") on to the Pumpkins' trademark sonic crunch(\\"hello kitty kat\\", \\"frail and bedazzled\\") and the James Iha penned \\"blew away\\" is the best he's written in my opinion. They also do an excellent Stevie Nicks cover(\\"landslide\\"), as well as a great cover of the Animals song \\"girl named sandoz\\"(perhaps a tribute to their supposed LSD use in their early days)and \\"starla\\" is unique in the fact that it starts off slow and melodic and eventually turns into total acid-rock mayhem complete with killer feedback at the end. \\"whir\\" is actually my favorite song on this album, it's just beautiful in melody ...\\"I've wasted all my years, been chasin' all my fears\\"...\\"whir yourself around, just to fall back down\\". This album is just a hodgepodge of excellent music from beginning to end, and really epitomizes the Pumpkins sound... If you're already a Pumpkins fan then you already know their brilliance, but to anyone new to this amazing group, I definitely recommend this album along with Siamese Dream as their top 2 albums. Also keep an eye out for Zwan, Billy's new band, featuring former Pumpkin(and the most awesome drummer ever) Jimmy Chamberlain.
B000060P79|5.0|This cd was definitely one of the best I have bought in a long LONG time.  I heard about them from their single I'm Just a Kid and ended up loving the rest of the cd.  The song One Day is definitely a song teens can relate with and so is the rest of the cd.  Highly recommended for any punk fan :)
B00003CX5P|1.0|The Phantom Menace is indeed a cinematic achievement. What other movie can you think of that can make accomplished actors like Liam Neeson, Ewan MacGregor, Natalie Portman, and Samuel L. Jackson appear to be abysmal? What other film (or trilogy) can you name that borrows so heavily from other sources (2001, Star Trek, Tolkien, Wagner, Kurosawa, Ben Hur) and has its creator still brazenly defending its originality? What other picture has been so overly hyped for its supposedly staggering special effects and yet those same effects are cartoonish and blatantly unrealistic?<br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the previous 3 movies (as a child). And, for all of its delusions of grandeur, Phantom does work very well as a children's movie. The characters are amazingly two-dimensional, and the one seemingly ambiguous character is obviously the evil emperor of the previous movies. There's a Satan/Frankenstein hybrid named Darth something-or-other who tries to fill the Vader void, but hopelessly fails. Maybe he needed to have that Nazi helmet thing going..<br />The Thing-Fish character, Jar-Jar Binks is (as everyone knows) so annoying that I'm not going to waste my time or yours by going into it. The young man who played Anakin really needed some instruction. Considering that there were so many capable adults involved with this thing that were awful, it's silly and needlessly cruel to criticize Jake Lloyd's callow performance. Hell, Haley Joel Osment would have stalled with such poor direction.<br />I recently rented this leviathan the other night, just to see if it really is as bad as I remember it. Indeed, it's worse. Even John Williams' score lacks the Wagnerian passion of the previous movies. Personally, I don't believe the original Star Wars movies are THAT good (Empire is by far the best of the 3), but at least they're good fun. 2001 is, for me, immaculate science fiction. As remarked upon by many people, Phantom is truly a movie for children. I'm prepared for the zillion \\"not-helpful\\" votes that will rake against me, but many of the hard-core fans of these movies display a very childish devotion to this cinematic franchise. Whereas once children strove to emulate adults, these puerile people are adults who desire to be children.<br />However, judging the Phantom Menace by these standards isn't entirely fair. By far the most important legacy of these Star Wars movies is the marketing ploys and techniques that has made the SW movies the biggest things since sliced bread. With the Obi-Wan bathrobes, Darth Vader toy lightsabers, Wookie spaying kit, Luke undergarments, Jar-Jar Binks greatest reggae hits CDs, Han Solo's 12-Step Book on Isolation Therapy, Slave Leia pinups, etc etc, as well as around 2 thousand different versions of these films on video, the Star Wars creator's true talent is for milking the drone-like adherents of his intergalactic Empire. I feel like throwing my battered old Star Wars VHS tapes into the nearest Yoda trash can.on \\"not-helpful\\" votes that will rake against me, but many of the hard-core fans of these movies display a very childish devotion to this cinematic franchise.

B00005JL3A|5.0|I have to say that I was very disappointed in the editor's review of this movie...<br />Resident Evil was a very well done suspense ride.  I don't normally go to theaters to see horror flicks.  I went to Res Evil primarily because I am a fan of the games.  The first whole half of the movie was nothing but build-you-up-on-the-edge-of-your-seat suspense.  Wash the second half down with a tall glass of anxiety, fear, and anxiousness.  Very well done effects, lighting and sound!  The story stayed very true to the games and even had a great tie-in with the third game in the series \\"Nemesis\\".  What was even beter about this movie was the ending.  Nowadays great movies get slaughtered by horrible endings.  This ending was simple, clean, and to the point - Milla Jovovich is coming back for a sequel to kick more zombie butt!<br />Bottom line is - on July 30th, go buy this DVD or rent it, pop some pop corn, get a nice cold soda, curl up on your couch with a loved one, and get the hell scared right into you :)
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril lavigne has to be one of the raddest punkest chicks ever. With her down to earth personality and raw lyrics on her new album &quot;Let Go&quot; it is definately going to take her far. She reminds me so much of myself and finally there is a postive role model for teenage girls in the music business. it is about time. Her music on the cd varies from a poppy track (Complicated) and gets punker and more hardcore as she goes. Therefore appealing to many different audiences. At a young age of seventenn I am sure we will be hearing much much more from this Candian artist. Hope to catch her on tour soon in the States!!<br />Much love &amp; Rock Out!<BR>[-Tara Lyn-]
B000065U1N|5.0|I'd first like to say I'm a big military buff myself and am joining in a few years, and this movie is the best I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. This movie fairly accurately portrays what actually happened that fatefull Sundy afternoon October 3, 1993. It's missing a few parts of the actual happenings, but if they were to make it like it was exactly what happened, it could of lasted probably 4 hours if not more. After reading the book, the movie was a let down for me, but still a great movie none the less. I suggest you see the movie first, and read the book after, because if you like the movie, you'll love the book. The book also has more action then the movie (hard to believe, I know), so it'll keep you reading.
0789723107|5.0|What makes this book valuable:<BR>- in-depth treatment of navigation design. The sections on tabs and breadcrumbs are excellent;<BR>- great section on effective home page design. Get this book along with Nielsen's \\"Homepage Usability\\", and you're set in this department.<BR>- wonderful primer on usability testing. If your web team is small, this could be all you need to get started with informal user testing. My own experience supports Steve's: you don't have to have Ph.D. in human factors to facilitate fruitful usability tests;<BR>- last, but not least, the book is very easy to read due to its witty tone, short paragraphs, and tons of bullets.<br />One thing this book could do better:<BR>- have more informative headings, saving \\"the liberal doses of wit\\" for the body copy. This would have made it a better reference.<br />Conclusion:<BR>The book scores a perfect 10 with its target audience: the designers, developers, project managers, producers, marketers, business owners, and those who \\"sign the check\\". However, if you are a seasoned designer looking for a little more in-depth treatment of interface design topics check out either my own book at paulgokin dot com or Eric Eaton's \\"Designing Web site Interactive Elements.\\"
6305511055|5.0|This is an extraordinary film, with a tremendous cast.  I found the images of the world trade center very difficult to watch, after Sept 11.<br />This film is so much better than the CIA movies recently released, including Redford's Spy Game.  If you like spy movies, buy or rent this one!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I am counting down the days till the Disney's 'Beauty and the Beast' goes platinum. This has been my favorite Disney movie since it came out. I don't know what it is about it, the characters, the music, the magic, all classic examples of what makes it pure Disney. I was there when Susan Egan did her wonderful version of 'Belle' on Broadway (and I must say she did a terrific job!). And when it went to IMAX, I was first in line to see it (I believe 'WOW' was the only word I could say for the rest of the night.).  When DVDs came out, I was afraid I'd have to transfer my VHS Disney collection to DVD. But now since Disney has taken it's finest classics to a greater level, 'platinum edition', I just decided I'd buy those. Of course I got 'Snow White' for christmas from my Uncle (Thanks!). I wasn't really a huge 'Snow White' fan, but I wanted to get it to show how big of a Disney fan I am. I adored all the special features on it! I had a blast! It took me acouple of hours just to take a tour of the special features on both discs! When I found out 'Beauty and the Beast' would be Disney's next platinum edition, I was siked! I was so incrredibly happy I couldn't sleep. I just can't wait to fall in love with 'Beauty and the Beast' all over again...
B00003CXCS|5.0|I grew up with the Sound of Music!  This is a great DVD with lots of &quot;extras&quot;.  Add this to your collection, you won't be disappointed!
0064407667|5.0|it's just great....this book opens up the best of the worst that could ever happen.
B00000K19E|5.0|The plot twists and turns and is quite unexpected.  Great movie!  Must have for your collection!
B00000DCHI|5.0|I bought these CD's a while ago and I can't get enough of it! Almost every song I knew before I bought it and all the ones I didn't know I grew to love just like the rest of them. Almost every song on these CD's I know by heart. If you like Billy Joel this CD set is the perfect one to capture all of his greatest.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's lyrics are very well writen, and seem to speak directly to the listener. Most people could relate to what she sings about, and that's what people like to hear. She's got very cute manerisms with her voice, such as her pronounciation of &quot;r.&quot; Over all, this is a Cd that you can listen straight through without skipping any tracks.
B000068CNX|5.0|I'm really curious and I really want to see what is different and added on this DVD.<BR>I live in Europe and all the episodes (not uncut) which were shown on TV were released on VHS and DVD, so I've seen all the episodes from every season including season 8 about too many times and I'm a really big fan of the show. Unfortunately, I can't play an American DVD (region 1) on my DVD player so I'll have to watch my Friends collection again and I'll probably never know how the new DVD is like with all the special features and uncut scenes. But I'm sure that season two (and season one) will be very good because Friends is the best sitcom ever! It really [stinks] that you had to wait 8 years for this but I'm sure that it will be worth waiting for!<BR>And a little message for Andy Radke: Your list with all the episodes of season two is not completely correct, you switched the last two episodes, TOW The Chicken Pox is episode 23 and TOW Barry and Mindy's Wedding is episode 24...<BR>I can only imagine how it will be but I'm sure it's going to be really good. So all you Friends fans: enjoy it, it's going to be great!
B000066NW0|5.0|For those of you who crank the Radio every time \\"Complicated\\" comes on then don't waste another second cause you'll love her devout CD `Let Go'<BR>For the rest of you, her first Cd has a lot more to offer then just one song.  This Cd isn't just about the music but about a young, beautiful, talented girl who had a dream, and then the WILL power to strive for that dream.  <BR>Each song she sings is full of talent whether it is the lyrics, the guitar riffs, and as you should ALL know her voice alone makes the song (Cd) worth listening to.<BR>For a devout album she has out done herself.  So look out Brittney cause Avril knows what she wants, she knows how to get it...and she'd better not stop until this world is rockin' and everybody on it is \\"anything but ordinary\\"<BR>Avril from me to you...you have inspired me to set my goals high and to never lay down never roll over for anyone.  <BR>`If you can dream it, you can do it'  <BR>Go get em' AVRIL.<br />I obviously give Avril a 6 out of 5 for this Cd.  <BR>Oh and one more thing...this Cd is for everyone..Hell I'm 20 and I bought it June 4 (day it hit the shelves) now you should do the same!<br />Adios...Phil M. Wight
B00003CXTG|1.0|I cannot believe they put so much time and money into a movie as [bad] as this one. Even the battle scenes didn't bring any emotion to me. (Not to mention the utter lack of blood and body parts, which made the Pearl Harbor attack scene seem very unrealistic. My friend and I blamed this on the MPAA). The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because my friend and I fast forwarded through over an hour of the movie to get to the war parts. <br />Now that I think of it, I will give this movie only one star because of all the fast forwarding we had to do to see anything of interest in this movie.<br />The only reason I decided to rent this movie was to see what everyone was raving about. Can so many people be wrong about a movie? Why yes, they can.
1587990717|4.0|First of all my opinion of this book does not take into account those who haven't read this book. One of the central themes of this text is the role that events outside the Venn diagram (so to speak) have on our lives and in Taleb's case on his financial career. Die hard theorists who live by the assumption of everything being \\"i.i.d.\\" will not like this book. The only thing I would've like is more detail on his use of Monte Carlo methods and methodology.
0380789019|5.0|The book kept me interested and presented wonderful imagry.
B000066NW0|5.0|I honestly think this is the best CD in the world. Avril's mix of Pop and Punk is the best I have ever heard. You MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000000WF0|5.0|This album proves that the Verve are a force in today's rock 'n roll sound. Rock music with an incredible touch of sweet sentimental orchestrations. A very positive elevation in modern rock.<br />The band's leader, Richard Ashcroft, who might have faced the sun and cast no shadow according to Noel Gallagher's famous \\"What The Story Morning Glory\\" track \\"Cast No Shadow\\" which was dedicated to Ashcroft, but going through his lyrics and compositions on this album, the only thing that casts is Richard's enthusiastic attempt to make a statement with songs that will everlastingly find a place in your mind.<br />\\"Urban Hymns\\" opens up with a \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", which features music composed by The Rolling Stones' Mich Jagger and Keith Richards and words written by Richard. The song sounds as tender as fresh bread, with Richard pouring his heart out with one self confession after another, proclaiming that he is \\"a million different people from one day to the next\\" and that he \\"can't change\\". The video to this song explains exactly what its all about. This is a very uplifting introduction to one of the most talked about albums in recent years. 10/10<br />\\"Sonnet\\" is the one that will give you goose bumps. A rich love ballad with all the right hooks, and all the right words. As the title reveals, this is a sonnet (a poem) of love from Richard to his girlfriend (or boyfriend!) 10/10<br />\\"The Rolling People\\" is probably the grooviest track on the album and the grooviest song i have ever heard! Written by the band as a whole, the song is filled with cool psychedelia, great drum beats, some awesome guitar solos and strums...it's painful listening to this and not thinking that the Verve are able to do anything. 10/10<br />\\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" is another tender ballad written by the genius himself, Ashcroft. The song opens up with a very warm accoustic guitar backed up by a gentle string arrangement, and then Richard sings the opening lines \\"All this talk of getting over, it's getting me down my love...like a cat in a bag, waiting to drown, this time i'm coming down\\", and from then on it gets better and better with every line and that chorus line strikes gold \\"Now the drugs don't work, they just make you worse, but I know i'll see your face again\\" 10/10<br />\\"Catching A Butterfly\\" is another psychedelic track with a nice tempo, great guitar loops, and an effective drum beat. Very Beatles-esque tune with some of the creepiest lyrics in rock, maybe creepy out of some heavy drug use! 9/10<br />\\"Neon Wilderness\\" is an album filler. Written by the band's lead guitarist Nick McCabe, it sounds like a piece from Unfinished Music but worth its short time duration. Mostly instrumental. 7/10<br />\\"Space And Time\\" is a cool rock tune written by Ashcroft. I wonder why they never released this one as a single. By this track, i bet you would have already fallen in love with The Verve. 8/10<br />\\"Weeping Willow\\" is personally one of my favorites. Incredible use of those guitars man! And Richard sure as hell knows how to write some very moving and breath-taking lyrics. It sounds a lot like Oasis' \\"Columbia\\" from Definitely Maybe with Richard almost initiating the listener to see his way in the line that says \\"I hope you see like I see, i hope you feel like i feel\\" but it could also mean that he's talking with his lover to \\"stay beside me\\" which i would more agree with. 10/10<br />\\"Lucky Man\\" is the most uplifting tune in the whole album. The one that will put a smile on your face while you air guitar to it walking around an empty room lip synching to every word (that's what i do!) Richard's genius flourishes with this particular track. And it also seems that he's shifted his mood upwards, a very noticeable change from the rest of his songs in \\"Urban Hymns\\". The best line in the song has to be \\"Happiness, more or less, its just a change in me, something in my liberty?\\" I love it! 10/10<br />\\"One Day\\" is a confession of love from Richard once again to his anonymous lover. The drugs didn't work and the sonnet is out there, and now Richard is looking forward to a day when he and his lover \\"will dance again under fiery skies\\". A tender ballad that will find its way into your heart. 10/10<br />\\"This Time\\" has Richard vowing that he will not regret his past but instead this time he will rise into the light. A cool album filler with cool guitar hooks. And i just love those backing harmony vocals. 8/10<br />\\"Velvet Morning\\" is the next day's hangover. Richard talking more about life. That fuzzy microphone effect is a delight. 8/10<br />\\"Come On\\" is a cool guitar fueled track. An encouragement to let the spirit move you and don't be counted out. Ends with a very angry Richard throwing the F word around like a madman, and you thought Liam Gallagher was all that bad? Another uplifting song by the lucky man himself and his band which appears to be cast underneath his shadow! 8/10<br />Overall \\"Urban Hymns\\" is a classic. One of the best albums of the 90's. Right up there with Oasis, Nirvana and whoever else that rocked that decade.
B000066NW0|5.0|'Let Go' and Listen -- those are the best words of advice that I can give to those thinking of purchasing this album.<br />When the Avril Lavigne craze started among friends, I wasn't too sure who she was.  I downloaded 'Complicated' and was soon converted into a huge fan of the self-proclaimed skater girl.<br />Everyone is bound to find a song or two that they can completely relate to on Avril's debut album.  Whether you're out to express how important it is to be different or leaving your emotions to build up inside without a saying a word, 'Let Go' is, without a doubt, the album for you. <br />The lyrics and music are, well, the lyrics and music are amazing.  The album is a combination of genres.  One minute, you're a pop world, the next rock, and you might be able to find just a touch of punk mixed in, as well.  The mixture is a surefire recipe for success.<br />It's important to me to be able to relate to an album and this is one where I can relate to every track.  Very rarely does an album come along that has the power to do that.  I highly suggest picking up 'Let Go'.  You'll soon find out that you can't go too long without listening to it.
B0000508U6|5.0|The British band Coldplay is often compared to Travis and Radiohead.They are much different. Coldplay is much more pure.The band does look similar to Radiohead. Their music sounds akin to that of Radiohead and Travis's earlier works. But they are more mature, more heart broken, more sensitive, and more bound to the earth. They are what they sound like: the guitar,the drums,the meloncholy voice of their lead singer. With songs like \\"Demons\\" and \\"Yellow\\" and \\"Shiver\\", their album is addictive and hypnotizing. It can be listened to many, many times.It is a fairly short cd. Their new album is highly anticipated!!! I can't wait to hear it!! I love Coldplay!!1
B000066NW0|5.0|What's Up everyone. It's gonna be hard to express Avril Lavigne in a 1,000 words but I'll try. She is one of the hottest songwriters in the world today.

Avril Lavigne is one of the few people in the music buisness that doesn't want to be like everyone else, but just herself. It definitely reflects her music and it will definitely reflect other people's lives. <BR>     <BR>     So one word of advice, just buy the damn cd and you will be very satisfied. <br />Thank You.
B00005RD3X|5.0|I've searched high and low in a desperate struggle to find a CD that captured all of Bob Marley's greatest hits as well as my personal favorites.  Ladies and Gentlemen, look no further.  This is the greatest single collection of Bob Marley and the Wailers' music ever put together.  Plus, you cannot beat the price.  I have most of the CD's individually, and after adding them all up, it's well over [price].  Now I have a two disc Best of that has all the hits and it only cost me a mere [price].  From the moment you put these discs into your player to the moment they come out, you will be in a perpetual state of reggae intoxication.  You'll listen to this whole set through without changing one of the songs.  From the ever popular \\"No Woman No Cry\\" to my personal favorite, \\"Iron Lion Zion,\\" you'll be stunned by the amazing singing songwriting of this timeless performer.Whether you're new to Bob Marley's music or a die hard fan, it is the opinion of this author that this CD is an Essential.

B00005J6UR|3.0|When it first came out, \\"Gremlins\\" was completely underestimated by the studios, who didn't believe that it could be a success. Time (and the box office) proved them wrong, and \\"Gremlins\\" turned out to be an 1980's classic. Like me, there are many people who still cherish the memory of those little green monsters that turned Christmas into an orgy of mayhem. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't go beyond there. I must say that, having watched it again recently, many years after its release, it didn't thrill me as it did before, but I bought the DVD because I'm just a nostalgic sap and wanted to have a piece of my childhood in my collection. As for the edition, it didn't pass the test. The picture and sound quality is just a light improvement over the VHS version, and there are very few features. I was very excited when I saw there was a \\"Behind the scenes\\" material, but it wasn't a documentary, as I believed, only a text (sorry, folks). At least, the movie has Spanish subtitles. Like I say, I was disappointed, but for all of you who loved this movie, you'll find a place for it in your collection as you once did in your heart.
B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains is a superb band. The whole alternative rock movement of the early 90's has given the world such great music. Bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains changed the music world forever. This album is a classic staple of the Seattle Rock movement. Songs like \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Would?\\" are amazing. Layne Staley has one of the best voices in rock history. Jerry's Guitar playing is out of this world. All those bands of the early 90's sang tragic depressing tales about life. They sang about deep meaningful issues. Man looking back at those days makes me sad because of how bad music has gotten these days. Nowadays it's all repetitive, annoyingly, substanceless crap. I will cherish Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains for as long as i live.<br />R.I.P Layne Staley
B000060P79|5.0|ok dude if you dont have this cd you need to go get it! they are awesome they have been on tour with some of your favorite bands! blink 182, green day, sugar ray and tons of others and even on their cd they have guest voices from mark hoppus and joel from another good band good charlotte. their pop-punk tunes will get you hooked! &quot;im just a kid&quot; (on the &quot;The New Kid&quot; soundtrack) is their most heard of song right now but other songs such as &quot;I'd Do Anything&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; are even better! If simple plan is coming to your town go see them. OH! they are ALSO on the &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; sountrack with their song &quot;Grow Up&quot; which i fell in love with when i went to see the movie cause they have a distenct sound and you can tell who they are and its just great i just gotta say go buy it you wont regret it.
B00005YXZH|5.0|What more is there to be said?  I love this CD.  It is my first foray into Wilco (without Billy Bragg) and I have not had it out of my CD player since I got it.  Fabulous, especially &quot;I'm the Man Who Loves You.&quot;

B000066NW0|4.0|I bought the CD after hearing Complicated.  I liked the song but didn't expect much from the rest of the CD.  Pleasantly surprised.  The music has enough pop to appeal to 12 year olds, but also enough depth to not offend others.  Let Go will certainly be a hit with teenage girls seeking to identify with the lyrics, but it is still enjoyable for those who just like to hear a nice voice while driving around.  I particularly liked tracks 1 and 4.

They are called to their childhood \\"home\\" an orphanage led by \\"The Penguin\\", a mean old nun. She gives them a \\"divine mission\\". They have to collect 5.000 $ that the orphanage owes the government in taxes. From here the story picks up, as the Blues Brothers try to get together their old outfit in order to raise the money for their childhood home.<BR>This movie is filled to the brim with blues legends in supporting roles: Aretha Franklin, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles and James Brown...<BR>Belushi and Akroyd seem to support each other perfectly all the way through the movie, which includes propably THE most destructive car chase in history.<BR>Alot of people get a punch; Nazi's, country musicians, paramilitary units(SWAT) and the police...noone are exempt from the humor of the blues brothers. <BR>This is one of those rare movies that hit right home, and it seems like a flawless pearl, when looking at through the large library of mediocre humor around.<BR>Get the movie, and do yourself a favour and get the soundtrack too.

B00000JMOJ|1.0|I'm usually an Arnold Schwartzenegger fan, liking his action films like Terminator and Total Recall. I used to like this film as well, but then i read the book from which this movie came and found myself not liking this adaptation at all. <br />This is a very weak adaptation of a truly classic thriller novel. and i wish someone out there would take that action and put it on the screen--or maybe it is best read. <br />This movie feeds more off the established stature and persona of Arnold. we arent supposed to see Richard, the main character, when we see Arnold, but rather a Terminator-esque, Commando-esque guy who you should not mess with. and the fact that he is messed with at the beginning of the film already establishes that we are gonna see him kick some butt as the film trudges along. unfortunately that takes away any and all feeling of suspense and thrill that is found in the book and makes the film a waste of time and money. <br />So dont bother with this hapless adaptation of a truly thrilling book. Read the book instead and just imagine what action could be taking place as Richard tries to free himself of this game.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Approaching this film as an entity separate and apart from its fabulous reputation as the first in a series of books that have broken all records for children's literature, one must still stand in awe at the finished work in terms of its storyline, special effects, and splendid performance by an ensemble cast that transforms the beautifully articulated words from the books' author to a literal vision capable of transporting the viewer into the magical world of Harry Potter.  While I have read the books, I must admit to being less of a fan of them than many, for reasons I won't belabor here. Yet even I have to admit that this film constitutes a wonderful object lesson that the supernatural world of youthful magician's apprentices can in fact be faithfully and artfully depicted by a director who also happens to be singularly capable of envisioning the world of special effects and wonder described in the novels. This is great stuff! And as far as entertainment goes, this is an overwhelming success.<br />From the depiction of Harry Potter himself and his own native sense of wonder and mischief, to the motley crew of sidekicks, assorted hangers-on, and fellow craftsmen to be, the movie works as a vehicle for exploring the alternative world of possibilities such activities portend. From beginning to end, this is a kind of busman's tour of the world of the Brother Grimm turned upside down, falling over into wild adventures and merry childlike fantasies. None of it is substantial, however, and while I can readily applaud the skill and craft that went into making such a faithful production of this first of many novels about Harry Potter, I would also like to mention that this is all really just frosting, none of it very educational or useful for anything other than entertainment. And while the reading of the books at least fosters an appreciation for the possibilities of stretching the imagination and reading skills of the reader, the film version does nothing but push forward a solipsistic view of the world as a dominion best left to wizards and hobgoblins to worry about.  It is a sort of slap-happy fairy tale, but is one that is cleverly disguised as a youthful adventure. Enjoy it as entertainment. That's all it really is.rd a solipsistic view of the world as a dominion best left to wizards and hobgoblins to worry about.

B000065U1N|5.0|One leaves the theater breathless after seeing \\"Black Hawk Down\\". Now, with my new DVD in hand, I am pleased to be able to see this film whenever I like.  This is, most simply put, the most grittily realistic and overpoweringly authentic and accurate depiction of modern combat imaginable. This is the closest we ordinary citizens can come to the actual experience, as we are sucked involuntarily into the terrifying vortex of the world of modern combat. We careen into combat with the young volunteers, our hearts pounding, the sweat pouring off us as we go, feeling our blood pressure rise as we rappel breathlessly down with them to the hard dusty ground!  Of course, with Ridley Scott involved, one comes to expect such amazingly spellbinding theatrics, yet this movie threads quickly along the well-greased storyline provided in the best selling book, adding the sharp, quicksilver dimensions of reality only such a stunningly visual depiction can offer in addition. And, from the anxious hand tremors of a young trooper about to descend into the madness of a flurry of hostile gunfire to the knowing worried glances a special forces combatant exchanges with one of his men, this is a superbly acted, casted, and choreographed set of battle scenes. And the scenes go relentlessly on and on.<br />Precious little time is wasted here providing the outlines of what turns out to be a mission from Hell; policy makers in Washington (read Secretary Albright here, trying to show she could out-testosterone the guys) decide this bunch of cravenly aggressive mercenary tribes can be corralled and democratized, that Somalia can become an instant shining example of our new-found powers of nation-making, and the American peace-keeping forces are suddenly tasked with missions for which they are ill-equipped. Without sufficient armor or enough reaction troop strength, the command orders a kidnap mission to eliminate one of the warlords who is most actively opposing the new \\"pie-in-the=sky\\" political objectives, and a small force of young troopers are dispatched in several helicopters to make a quick-strike raid into the heart of Mogadishu. Just as they have reached the point of accomplishing their mission, a helicopter is shot down, and all at once, hell breaks loose.<br />Yet this is truly just the beginning. The story of how these men stood their ground, how exceedingly well they fought, and how savagely they staved off the vastly superior numbers of local opponents who were well armed and supplied is only now becoming the stuff of legend. The real question one is left with after seeing the movie (or after reading the wonderful book, as well) is how such a valiant and well-executed action could have ever been described by both our government and the press as a defeat. It is more a lesson in the extraordinary and shameful timidity of everyone in the chain of command, from Madeline Albright to Colin Powell to the Secretary of Defense on down, who refused the Battle Scene Commander the resources he requested, that literally doomed the mission once things began to go awry.<br />Therefore, while we did unfortunately lose eighteen men, we also inflicted hundreds of casualties on the opposing forces, and finally were able to successfully evacuate the balance of the American forces after having engaged the street fighters for an incredibly extended period of time. This engagement and the kind of men who fought in it should be sung of in battle hymns, not decried as evidence of American softness or lack of a will to fight. As always, the fault in the action lies not in the ferocious young men who fought and died so courageously and so well, but in the despicable and all too-human failures of their leaders and their government to use them wisely, to take greater care in placing them so carelessly in harm's way.  Simply put, this is a great film, easily one of the best war films ever produced, and one I can heartily recommend!

B00005JKJA|5.0|A truly excellent movie requires repeated viewings.  If you only need to see it once to &quot;get it&quot; then there's not much going on in it.  The trouble with David Lynch material is that you have to go into it recognizing that it will take repeated viewings.  This can be frustrating, but it can also be extremely rewarding.<BR> I don't want to spend time explaining this movie; I have spoken with a number of friends about their interpretations of this film, and they have all offered radically different versions.  This isn't the kind of movie that requires one explanation; it's a film that you submerge yourself in.  It's not about plot and story, but about images and impressions.  Don't try to figure the movie out, just experience it.<BR> Not all people like to just &quot;experience&quot; movies.  If you need a movie that has a cohesive plot -- and there's no shame in that! -- don't watch this movie.  This movie, like a Picasso painting, is not about a direct representation of events or people, but rather about the artist's impression of events and people.  And, let's face it, David Lynch doesn't have the most normal impressions of things.  But that's what makes his movies so fascinating: the sheer strangeness of them.  The imagery in his movies are striking and beautiful as well as frightening and haunting, and this movie is perhaps Lynch's most powerfully visual film yet.  The performances are also stellar; Naomi Watts is completely convincing in the many roles she ends up portraying (and you got to love Billy Ray Cyrus!).<BR> Know that you will need to view this movie more than once.  The greatest movies require repeat viewings to glean every bit of meaning and experience from them.  If the movie needs only one viewing, it's a shallow movie.  Cinematic masterpieces from &quot;Fight Club&quot; and &quot;Memento&quot; to &quot;Vertigo&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; all require multiple viewings in order to fully appreciate the genius behind them; &quot;Mulholland Drive&quot; is no different.  Yes, it can be frustrating to finish a film in confusion.  This just means you haven't watched it with the right mindset.  Prepare yourself to watch it again; that way, you won't feel the pressure to &quot;get&quot; the movie on the first pass and you can simply slow down and experience the movie as it is.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I didn't get to see the movie in the theater, so when I saw it on DVD (my husband pre-ordered it, thank Goodness!), I was happily surprised.  I really wasn't expecting anything, I really don't when I see movie adaptations of books.  And let me tell you, I love the books, I think they're truly wonderful.<br />I am always disappointed when movies cut bits out of books, but I understand the necessity, so I'll skip over that particular criticism, and just say that the production team did a magnificent job bringing Harry Potter to the screen.  Everything is as I imagined it, most of it even better.  Quidditch finally realized is a true treat for the eyes!<br />If you haven't seen this movie, and have a vivid imagination and can disengage your doubt and Twenty-first Century cynicism, you will truly enjoy this fantastical treat.  Trust me, I'm always right.
B000066NW0|5.0|The Cd,&quot;Lets Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne is a great CD. I have to say it is one of the best Cd's I have bought this year. The song &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; are to great songs. Complicated reminds you of that one person who acts like a totally different person around you than when they do around others. Everyone can relate to this song. And then the song &quot;Naked&quot; is about meeting someone who makes you feel so good that you just let all your walls or gaurds if you want, down. And they can see right through and you cant help but to let your self free of all of your fears. You should definatly go buy the Cd because you will be able to relate to it.
0452282152|5.0|The book is beautiful just like the painting.  It was a quick read that ended all too soon.   I couldn't put it down - I read it in two sittings and I couldn't even wait that long to finish it.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album is all I expected.  I think it's great that a punk girl in a guys world is making it with her own album.  Mostly about love, this c-d has the flavor of Lisa Loeb, mixed in with the content of a blink-182 song (minus the profanities).  What I mean by this is her album's about growing up and love, which is the same content as the blink dudes.  Probably my favorites are Complicated, Sk8er boi, and My World.  I think it's a good album to listen to in the car, and it's for everyone who likes punk rock.  I know I can't put it down.
B000002UAU|5.0|Ah, Sgt. Pepper. Quite possibly the most well-known and influential album in rock history. Easily one of the best. While it may not be in the same league as Revolver and Abbey Road, it is more outright fun than the other two, and equally well-produced. The music on Pepper is not necessarily better than the other Beatles albums, but it is definitley more \\"arty\\" and sophisticated. Massive string orchestras, horns, and a multitude of other instruments are featured very prominently on this album, and had been seldom used in rock before. Numerous production tricks and other sonic experimentations were used as well. Take the title cut and Good Morning, Good Morning, for example. Both are straightforward rock numbers that are enhanced by the deft use of horns and sound effects. The Beach Boys gave listeners a taste of this sophistication on Pet Sounds, and The Fab Four took it one step further on Revolver (tape loops on Tomorrow Never Knows, string quartet on Eleanor Rigby), but it was Sgt.Pepper that brought it to the next level. This innovation was a primary reason it was the first rock album to be considered a \\"masterpiece\\" (there were many masterpieces before this record, Pepper was only the first to be recognized as a masterpiece by the public as a whole, not just Beatles fans). But perhaps the most endearing quality of Sgt. Pepper is its balance between fantasy and reality. Take for example, the first two songs. The opener takes we listeners to a nightclub where Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (aka The Beatles) is performing. It seamlessly blends into With a Little Help From My Friends, performed by Billy Shears(aka Ringo Starr). Starr's honest, heartfelt vocal works perfectly with the song's notion of finding love. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band veers more towards fantasy, while With A Little Help From My Friends is more like reality. As with the first two songs, most of the tracks can be separated, although it isn't always easy to tell.<br /> After one-two punch of Sgt. Pepper and With a Little Help comes the trippy, psychaedelic anthem Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, with Lennon's grandiose lyrical images. The next three tunes, Getting Better, Fixing a Hole, and She's Leaving Home are all by McCartney. Getting Better is the most basic song on the album in terms of music and lyrics, but it is also one of the best, as it chronicles the trials and tribulations of a young man's life. The other two are both fine pieces as well, with Fixing a Hole propelled by solid guitar work, and She's Leaving Home is very touching indeed. Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite is in a way LITSWD's forgottten little brother, as it's circus-esque imagery and incredible sound effects certainly are quite similar. Within You Without You is another one of Harrison's sitar songs, and it is quite different from everything else here, which is what makes it so refreshing (it is about on par with Love You To from Revolver). When I'm 64 and Lovely Rita are charming, whimsical pieces, both having excellent vocals from Paul(Lovely Rita features a wonderful piano solo). After the direct-hit slice-of-life Good Morning Good Morning, you are suddenly brought back down to Earth with a faster-paced reprise of the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Clu Band and then move on to The Beatles' magnum opus, A Day in the Life. This is unarguably one of the greatest songs in rock history, with its haunting vocals and magnificent orchestrations, leading to a stunning finale. But before this review is over I should like to say that I am furious about the recent bashing this album has received.I do not think it is overrated in the slightest and deserves the acclaim it receives. However, I do think this would be rock's BEST album if Straberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane were included, but even without them it is still in my Top Ten.
0316236446|5.0|\\"Ed Emberly's Drawing Book: Make a World\\" really takes me back.  From my earliest days in elementary school (early 80's), I remember this book.  I did not then, nor do I know, have any appreciable artistic talent.  Yet, this book made very common objects, people, and places very easy to draw with a fundamental step-by-step instruction.  It gave even the least talented wanna-be artist an outlet for creative production.  I simply loved this book.  I had it checked out of the school library (with constant renewals) for almost an entire school year until the librarians put their foot down.  My parents were kind enough to buy me my own copy, and I carried it with me every day.  Even when I wasn't drawing, the setup of the book is creative enough so that a reader can almost come up with their own stories based on the drawings.  I have no idea where my old copy of this book is, but you can be sure that I am psyched to buy it again.
B00005YW4H|5.0|After reading a short review in a local trade, I was intrigued enough to purchase this CD without having heard a note...After just the first track, I was immediately thrilled that I took a chance on this fantastic new artist.  There is definitely an old soul at work within Ms. Jones', as her musical and vocal abilities are at once haunting and laced with a maturity and melancholy lacking in the music industry.  I'll be on the lookout for performance dates and any new music she decides to spin her magic on!

6305263248|4.0|Ronin, directed by John Frankenheimer, may not be his best movie, but it still delivers the action that most people today would want in a movie like this.<br />Ronin's plot is very simple. It's basically about a group of mercenaries that are being paid to find a case. That's about it. There are many plot twists and turns as the loyalty of some of the mercenaries turns from good to bad. <br />The action is well filmed. There are 2 very exciting car chases and numerous shootouts throughout the movie. There is also a lot of different cities and towns (all in France) that the mercenaries travel to. So by the end of the movie, it'll feel like you've just watched a huge 3-hour epic when you've only watched a 2-hour movie. <br />The acting is great. Robert DeNiro, Jean Reno, Jonathan Pryce, Stellan Skarsgard, and Sean Bean all give outstanding performances. The DVD is OK. It has a nice commentary by John Frankenheimer, an alternate ending, (which isn't that different from the original ending.) and a little booklet that chronicles the making of the film. It also comes in widescreen AND fullscreen formats. <br />All in all, it's a pretty good action movie with great action sequences/car chases and breathtaking cinematography, but the plot falls short. Even the pretty good acting can't save that.<br />1998; 121 minutes; Rated R for intense scenes of action/violence and strong language.

B000066NW0|5.0|&quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; The three words that come to mind when thinking of Avril Lavigne. And yet, those three words cease to begin describing the seventeen-year-old star.  When first hearing Avril's first single, &quot;Complicated,&quot; I was immediately pulled into the great beat and catchy lyrics of the song.  Needless to say, I was instantly a fan.  Avril Lavigne's CD, &quot;Let Go,&quot; has no intent of letting you down.  I was so impressed with the CD, I listened to it an average of 4 times a day.  An impressive range is expressed with this CD of Avril's talent.  &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; has a great rock beat; &quot;Ska8er Boi&quot; is really fast and catchy.  &quot;I'm With You&quot; has a great calm sound, and not only those three songs, &quot;Mobile&quot; relates to Avril's life.  Each and every song on the CD is unique and awesome!  A lot is to be learned from Avril's debut CD, all of it I have benefited from.  Overall, &quot;Let Go&quot; is the best CD I have ever had the chance to listen to.  I strongly recommend buying it right now as soon as you can; it truly is an astonishing work of art.
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is Avril Lavignes debut album. And though the title says to &quot;Let Go&quot; I think that everyone who has a copy of this album should make sure they DON'T 'let go' of it. I presonally felt connected to Avril in a way I'm not used to connecting to music. Her writing is straight from the heart and I feel that that is the reason her album is making headlines. *or should be* She displays a very alternative sound mixed with the upeatness of punk rock. &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot; are my favourites, why, because I relate to them most. I can relate to all of her songs but those two hit home the hardest with me. Avril Lavign is a very promising artist.
B000066NW0|5.0|I went right out and bought Avril Lavigne's debut CD, 'Let Go' as soon as it hit the stores, and it was worth it.. The 13 tracks on this CD each have lyrical and vocal strength, and totally reach out to anyone listening. Avril kicks off the CD with the song, 'Losing Grip' which starts out mellow, but in the chorus a raging power kicks in, and you begin to hear the real strength in her voice. In the songs 'Anything But Ordinary' and 'My World' Avril really brings a sense of her inner self to the audience, with entertaining lyrics and catchy tunes. The punky song 'Sk8r Boi' is a playful tune that I think most people would enjoy, and keeps you hanging from your seat as it tells an easy to follow and cute story within the song. Other tracks like 'Naked', 'Im with you', 'Mobile', 'Tomorrow', 'Unwanted', 'Nobody's Fool', and 'Too much to ask' really show a deep feeling for the music. In the songs Avril really puts herself and her emotion into the music and a shot of power is injected into the tunes with her voice. This is a new, fresh, and awesome artist that I would definantly reccomend. Im sure we can expect more great things from her in the future, but in the mean time, go out and get yourself Avril Lavigne's CD, 'Let Go'.

As soon as Close to the Edge gets heavy, you know why you got this DVD, especially with rare deep cuts like Gates of Delirium, Ritual, and In the Presence Of. The orchestra is young and having a great time playing with Yes. Bob Cesca adds some very cool optional computer graphics that add to the Magnification mystique. The Dreamtime documentary gives you neat behind the scenes footage and is quite funny! (check out the remix of Long Distance Runaround over the end credits). Overall production values are high, this is the best Yes DVD out there! Play it LOUD!

0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is definitely one of the best romantic novelists around. He's as good at writing romantic novels as J.K. Rowling is at writing fantasy novels, if you have any clue on what I'm talking about.<br />\\"A Walk to Remember\\" is probably his best novel yet...according to me. It takes place in the 1950's, and it's a story about one man recalling one year of his life as an 17-year-old guy and falling in love with the most unlikely girl in town. Landon Carter was not really known as a real \\"bad boy\\", but more like a misunderstood kind of teenager. Jamie Sullivan is the complete opposite of Landon and yet, she is the girl he ends up falling in love with. Jamie lives with her estranged old father, Hegbert Sullivan, who is a Baptist minister. She was a girl Landon had known all his life, but could never seem to imagine she would be the kind of girl he'd want to marry or love. She was kind-spirited and very religious. Jamie also had a secret...she has leukemia. Landon knew Jamie was going to die, but he still kept on loving her and they end up getting married.<br />It is a sweet novel. Very well-written. \\"A Walk to Remember\\" is now one of my favorite romantic novels, and should be read by all those hopeless romantics out there. The characters are described and developed well, too. I loved this novel and urge everyone to pick up their own copy to read. It's also very sad at the ending...just a little warning.<br />Grade: A
B00005MP58|3.0|It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a swimming pool. <br />The enduring image of this adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever spawned by the English language is that of Colin Firth emerging dripping and unclothed from a dip in his ornamental lake. If Jennifer Ehle had been the one to take her clothes off there might have been some point to it.<br />That said, Firth's performance did approach the memorable character Jane Austen created, when the script allowed him to. Jane Austen's book was cracking stuff and this script would have done well not to veer so far from it. The ending is sweet enough to induce terminal toothache.

If you are a shoe connaisseur or affictionado and also think that &quot;elegance begins with shoes&quot; then this book is the right choice for you.
0060012331|5.0|A new Discworld novel (actually probably a novella, by length, but it's bound in cloth with a price to match) by Terry Pratchett, this one skewering the tale of the Pied Piper, with some deep digs at Beatrix Potter... Warped, whacked out, very funny, his usual satirical twist on British customs and culture. So far Pratchett, though ringing the changes on quite a successful formula, has not really been repeating himself and certainly never boring anybody...This novel traces the tale of a cat named Maurice and his troop of rats, all of whom lived a bit too close to the wizardly garbage pile at Unseen University and thus were exposed to magical leakage and somehow developed intelligence. Maurice, being the cat that he is, hooks up with a stupid-looking kid who plays the flute, and they develop a lucrative scam infesting towns and being paid to rid the places of vermin...at which point the troop moves off to the next town. But these rats have plans of their own...and when they meet the story-spinning granddaughter of the famous Grim Sisters, the whole thing gets very messy.<br />Not a cute little talking animal story. Not really for children. Not a bad read, not at all.
0004723724|5.0|The Complete Works of Irish poet Oscar Wilde, which is published by Collins, is a must for a private library. It is an excellent book even if you only want to check one of Wilde's witty quotes - and there are plenty. The book includes Wilde's only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray, which caused a fin-de-siecle scandal about a century ago because of its underlying homoeroticism. There are also all his famous plays which he wrote and was loved for by English society such as The Importance of Being Earnest, An Ideal Husband as well as Lady Windermere's Fan. In addition, there are stories, poems (such as The Ballad of Reading Gaol - the jail he had to go to for his affair with Bosie Douglas), essays, and letters such as De Profundis. This newly illustrated centenary edition also incorporates recent revisions to the text, which probably only experts will spot.
B000065VB9|5.0|His third solo album, _Melting Face_ is a dark, dark album.  Instead of the upbeat guitar and drums of the strangely joyful &quot;Solsibury Hill,&quot; this album contains the creaky, ominous &quot;Intruder.&quot;  As that track suggests, &quot;Intruder's happy in the darrrrrrrrrkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,&quot; and apparently so is Gabriel.<br />After the downright sinister &quot;Intruder,&quot; Gabriel seems to be coming apart at the seams on &quot;No Self Control&quot; and &quot;I Don't Remember.&quot;  These songs sound light years away from his more upbeat material such as &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, &quot;Big Time&quot;, and &quot;Kiss That Frog,&quot; but the material on this album is more powerful and lasting than the lighter side of Peter Gabriel.  It's hard to pick just one highlight from this album, but the mini-suite &quot;Family Snapshot&quot; is immacuately arranged, going from a gentle vocal beginning, to driving verses and chorus (&quot;I don't really hate you/I don't care what you do/We were made for each other/me and you&quot;), and back again.  Elsewhere on the album you will find the politically-charged &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; and &quot;Biko.&quot; <br />All I can say is that this is an excellent album.  I think if people who know Peter Gabriel just from his hits on the radio pick this album up, it will definitely shock them - but in a good way.  Gabriel is probably one of the most successful musicians at fusing rock with other genres and not making it sound forced.  This was a very important album for me to listen to because it showed how an album should be put together in order to make listening to it an 'experience'.  Out of the 450+ albums in my collection, this easily is one of my favorites.  Pick it up - you won't be sorry.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Went to see a duo called Professor and Maryann play at a small bar in the city.  When they were finished Norah Jones and her band took the stage.  We were about to leave when we heard her voice. Needless to stay we stayed and listened to her set. We signed up for her mailing list and saw a few more shows. One night at the Makor, she was in between sets when my friend ran in to her in the ladies room. She asked her to play a song that we had fallen in love with when we saw her at The Living Room, She said she played it in the first set but she would try to play it again for us.  She did, and dedicated it to the girl from the restroom.  She was awesome!  We listen to the cd over and over again. It is a must Have.  I have turned so many people on to this cd - they thank me all the time!!  I rate this cd a 10 + + + .........  Don't miss out!
B000065U1N|4.0|Great movie, but the DVD doesn't have many extras to it.  There is a 25 minutes behind the scenes featurette that is informative.  <br />To really explore what happened to bring these events about, read the book.  It reads like a non-fiction thriller, but is based on many interviews and transcripts from the people who were on scene in Somalia.
B000002KO3|5.0|You got to include this album in your collection, it is a great Cd, the Talking Heads are a very creative band, and they prove it with this album.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Amazing. One of the first movies I have seen in a long time that made me talk about what happened throughout the movie instead of just the ending. Im still talking and thinking about it. Watch it at least 3 times to try to get everything.
B000002H2H|5.0|I think I like this one better than Master Of Puppets!  It opens well, with the short classical guitar piece, then goes into what is probably Metallica's fastest song &quot;Fight Fire With Fire&quot;.  &quot;Ride The Lightning&quot; is a great song, although not as good as &quot;Master Of Puppets&quot; for a title track.  Kirk Hammett's guitar playing got alot more creative than it was on Kill'em All, but the Kill'em All solos are still really good.  On songs like &quot;The Call Of The Ktulu&quot; you can really tell what a great band this is.  I think it's a better instrumental than &quot;Orion&quot;.  My favorite song on this cd would have to be &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, just because it's absolutely perfect.  Great ballad with great lyrics and some nice acoustic riffs, then it turns electric and has one of Kirk's best solos ever.  Buy this cd if you like Master of Puppets alot, or if you just love metal.
0312265859|5.0|This series just gets funnier and funnier. Spiders in a car, a killer bunny and more Grandma Mazur.....definitely a recipe for a best seller. Stephanie's car problems are starting to get a little repetitive at this point, but the ways in which she gets the job done are still fresh and quite entertaining.
B0000028UK|4.0|This album is pretty good. I don't like it as much as I liked Ten, but there's some really awesome songson this one. \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\" and \\"Daughter\\" are especially good. Mike McCready plays some awesome solos. He's great with a wah wah pedal. Stone keeps playing the original rythym riffs he's know for. Eddie always gives a great vocal performance. Pearl Jam is definitely my favorite grunge band. But overall, this album just didn't have the same effect on me that Ten did. That doesn't mean it's not worth buying though, I'm glad I have it.

B0000025T6|5.0|Normally I don't view pop music as a serious art form. This album is an exception. There is simply nothing like it.<br />Springsteen completely fulfilled his early promise on this album, and managed to work around his natural limitations. His earlier works were verbose, poetic, and energetic but a touch bombastic. He never was a great singer, which has always been a big limitation, in my opinion. This album is sustained brilliance in every aspect, from the lyrics to the atmosphere to the progression of songs. The rough material and unfinished production makes his voice seem right at home like it never has before, the roughness lending a compelling sincerity. <br />Springsteen is bleak and full of despair on this album, but the progression of songs provides a note of hopefulness that (for me) makes it not too depressing to listen to frequently. The album starts out with a narrative from a serial killer (\\"Nebraska\\") and goes on to chronicle the stories of losers, victims and gamblers (\\"Johnny 99\\" \\"Atlantic City\\" \\"State Trooper\\"). However, even the first half of the album isn't completely hopeless, as the characters value their bonds of family (\\"Mansion on the Hill\\" \\"Highway Patrolman\\") or relationships, be they twisted or loveless (\\"Nebraska\\" \\"Atlantic City\\").<br />The album brightens a bit with \\"Used Cars,\\" which is a quiet tribute to youthful defiance of circumstances and \\"Open All Night\\" which is just a straightforward road song. \\"My Father's House\\" is a song of loss but also of epiphany. \\"Reason to Believe\\" although perhaps the weakest on the album, closes on a tenuously hopeful note. <br />Even if you are NOT a Springsteen fan, you owe it to yourself to listen carefully to this cd at least once. It may be too bleak for some to be a favorite, but it is one of the few albums by a pop artist that truly shows passionate artistic brilliance.
0446677450|5.0|This is a great book and exactly mimics my situation (of a few years ago) and a lot of others out there. It opens up the minds of those (like myself!) who thought that those persons who are in business for themselves do so because no one else would hire them!! Boy! Was I ever wrong! I should have read it earlier (like 10 years ago!), my life would have probably taken a different turn.<br />I encourage all to get this book. Read it at least twice.
B00005JKGI|5.0|Since my review of February 9th, I've learned that some painfully talentless and typically unoriginal hacks ARE filming a remake, starring (Gasp!) \\"Marky\\" Mark Wahlberg as Charlie Croaker, to be released in 2003.<BR> <BR> The film is directed by F. Gary Gray, who brought us such memorable films as \\"Friday\\" and \\"Set It Off\\".  I'm sure someone must remember them...<BR> <BR> One positive note: I'm sure the GENUINE ITEM will finally be available on DVD in time for the run-up to this ersatz Italian Job.
B00003CX5P|5.0|this movie tells you what happend to Anakin Skywalker and how he  started out as  a nice young boy . This episod showed the true nature of darth vader as a youg boy.The movie,in my opinion,is,I have to say, the best movie I've seen in years but, STARWARS:EPISODE 2 is far more better though.STARWARS ROCKS!!!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I was not interested in becoming a Harry Potter fan. I fought hard against it! A friend of mine badgered me into seeing it. All she could talk about was Harry this and Harry that. So to shut her up I agreed to see it. I LOVED IT!!!!!!! From the moment the movie started to the end credits, I was engrossed in what adventures Harry, Ron and Hermione would have next! (I did not care for the Dursley's at all!!)After seeing this movie, ALL I could talk about was Harry this and Harry that! Talk about a change of heart! Rush out and buy the DVD version today!!! Play the game to see the deleted scenes. Have a ball with Harry and his friends! To anyone who has not read the books, I would recommend those also!
B000002I53|5.0|When I started liking jazz at 17 (Can it really be 40 years ago?) I avoided Coltrane, because he was into some &quot;free-form&quot; dissonance that was too radical for my ear. I did Henry Mancini's &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; instead (great) and some Brubeck, some Shearing, Maynard Ferguson, Tito Puente, Modern Jazz Quartet and a little Miles Davis. I never did get around to Coltrane until this week. This album came out when I was in 10th grade, just prior to Mr. Coltrane getting so experimental. I wish I had been wise enough to buy it then, but I am so glad to have it now. Listening to this with earphones is a religious experience. The nearly 14 minutes of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; from &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is worth the price of the CD all by itself. That one piece is kind of a text as to the functioning of a jazz quartet, the dissection and expansion of a popular song, the sensuous joy of soprano saxophone. The next song, Cole Porter's &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye&quot; is less than half as long, but there is room within it for pianist McCoy Tyner to have a lovely solo into my left ear, followed by a great solo bass part by Steve Davis into the right ear, with drummer Elvin Jones doing steady, supportive quiet work throughout, and then Coltrane's sax coming back on the right to restate the main theme. Remarkable sounds. The second half of the record has Coltrane switching to tenor sax for a lengthy uptempo version of &quot;Summertime&quot; that gets better with each minute, but which is quite a departure from the normal way  we have always heard the standard from &quot;Porgy and Bess.&quot; The last piece, &quot;But Not For Me&quot; is one of my all-time Gershwin favorites. Without the wonderful lyrics, it doesn't have all of its power, but Coltrane, Tyner, Davis and Jones do some amazing things within its framework. All in all, this is what I would consider an American jazz essential recording to own.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|I almost hate to admit it, but this is a funny movie. I was filled with trepidation when it started, because everything I'd heard was so negative.<BR>Those who criticize it are right - it is really, really stupid. But it's one of those movies that KNOWS it's stupid, and somehow makes it OK with a wink and a nudge, inviting you inside.<BR>The incredible insularity of these characters, who don't realize how shallow and petty they are, trapped in a plot that only makes sense if you accept their world view that being a male model is important, has a lot to do both with why it's funny and why the humor works. The \\"walk off,\\" the gas station scene, the center for kids who don't read so good, the coal mine scene, and lines like \\"I've got a prostate the size of a honeydew and a headful of bad memories\\" delivered in utmost earnestness ... it's just funny. And somehow the movie makes you sympathize with this incredible idiot at the center of the plot, probably because you catch just a glimpse that maybe he realizes how stupid he is. <BR>The soundtrack of mostly 80s pop tunes is pretty good too. <BR>This is not a classic, it's about as thin as the material it parodies. But it's also one the funiest movie I've seen in a couple of years. I don't know if that's a comment on me, the movie, or the state of cinema comedy these days.<BR>(On the down side: I had \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\\" running through my head for three days after. Oh God, here it comes again!)
B00004Z459|5.0|Wow!  This is easily the best CD that I have ever heard.  With 11 quality songs on it (&quot;Cure For The Itch&quot; not being one of them because it isn't a song), I can listen to Hybrid Theory over and over again without getting tired of it (which I have done).  The combination of the hard rock, rap, and mixing is incredible.  &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is my favorite track on the CD, and also just my favorite song.  &quot;In the End,&quot; &quot;Crawling,&quot; &quot;Papercut,&quot; and &quot;Points of Authority&quot; are also great songs.  I have heard bands that sound something like Linkin Park, but nothing comes close.  Chester Bennington (the singer) and Mike Shinoda (the rapper) form a great team, but what really holds this band together is the heavy guitar chords and the mixing, and the bass and the drums are not to be forgotten.  The amazing combination of all these instruments creates a unique sound that is incredible.  This album is easily worth your money, and you just have to be thankful that CDs are durable because you'll be playing this one over and over and over again.
B000059TEP|1.0|This is an embarrassing movie. The plot is hackneyed, one big cliche after another. The acting just insipid. <BR>Don't get me wrong. I'm a fairly romantic guy. This movie doesn't do it It's just dreadful. Somebody, please, make Patrick Swayze go away.<BR>If you want to see a great romantic movie that features lost lovers returning from the grave to comfort and aid their enamoratta, check out the contemporaneous British film &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply.&quot;
B000000WFZ|5.0|A couple of times since I bought this album, during some of the darkest moments of my life, I have shut my door, opened my window, knelt on the cold hard floor, and gazed skyward as I listened to several tracks, notably On Earth as It Is in Heaven, Falls, Climb, Gabriel's Oboe, and Miserere. <br />This simple, private act of utter surrender has never failed to bring me back hope, and grace, and strength, and faith.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I don't know where to start....  Either you love this movie or you hate it.<br />I love dumb humor movies but there was something about &quot;Zoolander&quot; that appealed to me.  I guess to watch a movie poking fun at the modeling industry and the jokes throughout the film, I found it hillarious.<br />I really liked how the DVD was made, very &quot;Austin Powers 2&quot; like with talking during the menu selections, people dancing on certain screens and the typical secret easter egg center.<br />The DVD has a plethora of special features and looked great in terms of video quality and audio quality was ok (since this is mostly a talky).<br />The plot is situated around the fashion industry and male models.  Some people will laugh their head off and some will think it maybe just too stupid.<br />So, it depends on the individual.
B000003KMM|5.0|This movie is my personal favorite.  Ive seen it at least 40 times and i still laugh.  With lines such as &quot;Forget about the Curve ball Ricky throw em the heater&quot;  &quot;Is this the whales section&quot;  &quot;if you dont help me now i say forget you Jobu&quot; and &quot;you cant say (that) on the air&quot;  &quot;nobodys listening anyway&quot;  it follows a great plot and is the most funny movie ive ever seen if you have a collection or not its a must have
B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on the radio, I thought it was Shelby Flint singing.  Lovely, soft voice.  Thanks, Norah!
B00005R87Q|3.0|If you like cool cars, hot chicks, and don't really care much about the story/characters, this is a great movie to watch.<br />If you like the setup of this movie, but want to see better character development, more believeable story, check out 'No Man's Land' (D.B Sweeney, Charlie Sheen). oh, it also got nice cars (mostly Porsche :D)
B00003CXI1|3.0|The ending really needed to be different. I wasted 23 dollars for this movie. I wouldn't be that sad about if they had a alternative ending but this ending licks eggs. Don't see the second movie until it comes on video. Rent it, don't see it in theathers or buy it.
0783226845|4.0|It's Al Pacino again outpacing just about everybody else in the cast.  Here he plays Frank Slade, a retired, blind and embittered US Army officer unloaded on a young prep-school student for Thanksgiving.  Slade was brilliant and fearless, which meant he had no friends and was repeatedly passed over for bigger and better things.  Embittered and alcoholic, he tried juggling live grenades once and...something bad happened.  Blinded in the accident, Slade lives with the only family members who can stand his ranting - but the Colonel obliges them by keeping to his own room for most of the time, and by forming a secret plan that will put him out of everybody's misery.  Without giving away too much - the plan involves a room at the Waldorf in Manhattan, a bottle of the finest Jack Daniel's, Thanksgiving dinner with the relatives who couldn't stand to live with him, a night with the most expensive woman in Manhattan, a limo, his .45 service pistol...and one bullet.  <br />Unfortunately for the plan (but not for Frank) the prep school student assigned to nurse him through the weekend is Charlie Sims, played by Chris O'Donnel (a less confident and less immature and American version of Hugh Grant's shtick).  Sims has his own problems - expulsion from school, and from a more financially insured future unless he names students he saw involved in a prank against the school's pompous head dean.  The dilemma between losing his future and his honor plagues Charlie thruought the weekend, and only makes it easier for Frank to dragoon him into a jaunt to New York.  (Another student is also a witness, but that boy comes from a wealthy family and can afford to stay quiet) Over the weekend, Frank alternates between browbeating and educating Charlie in the ways of being a man, specifically an American man (between running for cover and facing the music, running is the better idea, Frank advises).  The script purposefully makes Sims a wuss if only to force Slade into seizing a cause more desperate than his own.  In the end, it's no surprise that Slade will come to the rescue, fighting for Charlie before the school board with an impassioned oratory that's pure Pacino.  \\"(I'm out of order?  I'M OUT OF ORDER!?\\")  Pacino plays well off the very soft-spoken O'Donnell without appearing to bully him, and fits in well with everybody else in a film cast heavily on character actors like James Reborn (you may remember the pompous dean who holds O'Donnell's future in his hands was also the weaselly SecDef from \\"Independence Day\\", the slick prosecutor from \\"Carlito's Way\\" or the sinister exec who talks Michael Douglas into joining \\"The Game\\".)  Even if you're not a Pacino fan, this flick will still keep you sniffing.
B0000640VN|5.0|This is certainly one of the most romantic movie I have ever seen.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I saw this just a few months ago on the big screen(campus screening), and if ever I had any impulses to experiment with drugs, this movie completely destroyed them. This movie is a portrait of a living hell that lots of people live in right now, and damned if it don't make you feel dirty after making it through the last 30 minutes of this movie. Downward spiral is right; this movie is the most depressing, shocking, and hopeless movie I am sure I will ever see as long as I live. But you need to see it for yourself...
B000066NW0|5.0|The debut album Of Avril Lavigne is one of the best cds I have ever heard. It has inspired me so much. Avril has a great voice and she rocks. This is deffintly one of the cds to add to your collection!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go is by far the best cd I have ever bought.  There is so much versitility to Avril's music.  Songs like \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"Unwanted\\" have a rock/heavier metal type sound, while \\"I'm With You\\" and \\"Things I'll Never Say\\" are more mellowed out.  \\"Nobody's Fool\\" has some rap in it, and songs like \\"Complicated\\", \\"Sk8er Boi\\", and \\"My World\\" are very upbeat and energetic.  All of the songs have excellent lyrics that tell it how it is; people being fake, being looked down on for what they look like, trying to be changed by other people, and many other topics.  Avril has a beautiful voice; hitting the high notes no sweat, producing a strong sound, and making the listener feel the emotion in her voice.  She is an amazing, talented(plays the guitar and wrote all of her own songs) young woman, and I hope she continues with her music in the future.  This chick, and her music as well, rocks!
B000066NW0|5.0|Before you buy this cd there are very important things you need to know:<BR>-Don't buy any other cd at the same time you buy LET GO beacuse once you hear it you won't want to hear nothing else. (Trust  me, I'm hearing it as I write!!).<BR>-You will love every single song of it and you will never choose a favorite.<BR>-You'll feel the need to buy a guitar and play her songs.<BR>-It contains a hidden message: Be Yourself!!!<BR>-Remember you're listening to the next big thing and once you hear it you have to spreat the word: Support Avril!!<BR>-Some cool phrases:<BR> \\"I'm starting to trip I'm losing my grip and I'm in this thing alone\\" Losing Grip<BR> \\"Honesty promise me I'm never gonna find ya fake it\\" Complicated<BR> \\"He's just a boi, and I'm just a girl, can I make it anymore obvious\\" Sk8er Boi<BR> \\"Isn't anyone trying to find me, won't somebody come take me home\\" I'm With You<BR> \\"I'm wakin' up to say I've tried, instead of waking up to another TV Guide\\"<BR> \\"I tried to belong it didn't seem wrong my head aches\\" Unwanted<BR> \\"It's always been up to you, It's turning around it's up to me\\" Tomorrow<BR> \\"Somebody rip my heart out and leave me here to bleed\\" Anything but Ordinary<BR> \\"Tryin' to be so perfect, Cause I know you're worth it\\" Things I'll Never Say<BR> \\"In this head my thoughts are deep, Sometimes I can't even speak\\" My World<BR> \\"If you want to bring me down, go ahead and try\\" Nobody's Fool<BR> \\"Can't you see that you lie to yourself, You can't see the world through a mirror\\" Too Much To Ask<BR> \\"I wake up in the morning, put on my face\\" Naked
B00005YUNY|5.0|Yes? Aren't they a 30 plus year old rock dinosaur with a few moldy hits from the seventies? The short answer - no, no, a thousand times no! If that's how you feel about this eminent prog rock band, this DVD will blow all of your preconceptions away. A fresh mix of classic epic masterpieces and new songs from last year's \\"Magnification,\\" this DVD is Yes music to it's fullest glory. The combination of top musical performances by the band, including guitar maestro Steve Howe and bassist Chris \\"The Fish\\" Squire, with the European Festival Orchestra packs a musical punch that will leave you breathless. Yes' music have always had a symphonic sound and you'll be amazed at how the orchestra brings out the real power and impact of their songs. \\"Close to the Edge\\" and \\"Gates of Delerium\\" stand out in particular. <BR>Perhaps the only disappointment is the inclusion of \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"Seen All Good People\\" in the set - these songs have been played ad nauseum in the past and it would have been nice to see something different as a finale. <BR>In a musical landscape dominated by teen pop fluff and angry rock/rap clones, Yes represents an old way of thinking - music as art. So is their music still relevant today? <BR>Perhaps more than ever.
B000066NW0|5.0|This cd has to be it. It has eveything. A mad, punked-out chick who doesn't care if Britney likes it or not. She has her own style with her gutair in her hand and her ... attitude. We all need to look to up to Avril and forget all about the Pop scene. Some of her songs on this cd are really good. \\"Sk8tr Boi\\" is only one of them. It very catchy and should be the next single. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is a great one to. It tells of a girl who is nobody's fool. If you buy one cd this summer, it has to be this one. Whenever you feel angree, happy, or sad, just put this into your cd player and sit back and chill. Avril has got it all!...
B00005YUNY|5.0|I was a little hesitant about buying this DVD after seeing the symphonic show live two times. The sound of the orchestra was never mixed right the nights I saw them. But the DVD is excellent. The sound quality is the best of any Yes DVD to be released to this point. And the band and the orchestra play with a great deal of energy. Steve Howe is his usual subdued self but his playing is flawless. Howe looks especially bored on \\"Owner of a lonely Heart\\" but anyone who had just played pieces like \\"Ritual\\" and \\"Gates of Delirium\\" would be bored playing a little pop tune like Owner afterward. Anyone who is a fan of the classic yes line up will love this concert. This is one of the best concert videos, if not the best, I have seen.
B000068FXX|4.0|Although slightly overlooked in the face of \\"Crime Of The Century\\" or \\"Breakfast In America\\", this album is my favorite <BR>Supertramp effort.  Although they were only one album away from<BR>the streamlined pop of \\"Breakfast In America\\", \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" contains some of their most progressive work,<BR>along with the pop stuff.  The listener will most likely recognize the opening \\"Give A Little Bit\\", a lightweight, catchy<BR>number dominated (unusually for Supertramp) by guitars, which remains one of their finest singles.  The closing \\"Fool's Overture\\", on the other hand, is a quasi-symphonic epic with <BR>a grand, majesterial sound; divided into several sections, it is sure to prick the ears of prog-rock fans.  The masterpiece, however, is the title track, which starts out somewhat unassumingly before it evolves into one of the most drone-like, hypnotic efforts in their canon.  Very unusual for a mainstream rock band in the late 70s.  The rest of the tracks, like \\"Lover Boy\\" and \\"Babaji\\", are all very competent keyboard-dominated studio rock from the period, well-composed and sung, although Supertramp were always a tad too slick in these moments for my tastes (a problem that would worsen considerably with \\"Breakfast In America\\").  Still, all seven tracks are worthwhile, and in the case of \\"Give A Little Bit\\", the title track and \\"Fool's Overture\\", must-hear classics.  There is enough diversity here in terms of style and instrumentation to mark the band as one of the more creative of the mid-to-late 70s.
6304712936|5.0|In 1984 I was hesitant to see this film.  Being a historical drama, set in 18th Century cities and costumes, you would think it would be a chatty, dry, and uninspired (not to mention that you might expect everyone to speak in British accents).  Amadeus is none of those things.  It is an inspired film of intelligence, probing psychological depth, and gripping darkness.<br />I finally saw this film on VHS in 1994, a whole decade after the theatrical release, after all the hype had dissolved.<br />I have been a music student since I was six years old.  I've always been such an eclectic person, listening to everything from rock to classical, and absorbing myself in the lives of the great composers (Bach, Mozart, etc.)  No other life in musical history is as mysterious as Mozart's, and this film brings his life... well.... back to life.<br />You must understand this is a work that is hard to classify as fact or fiction.  While we all know Mozart died from a rheumatic fever, after his death rumors DID spread of a poisoning by Salieri.  The rumor was even believed by Mozart's wife Constanze (accounts of this societal gossip is found in many books of Mozart's biography).  Also, when the real-life Antonio Salieri was an old man, he was confined to an asylum, convinced that he did commit the murder (also a prooved biographical fact).  This is a fact that seems to remain overlooked.  Needless to say, the tale, Amadeus, is only rooted in the rantings of a paranoid, schizophrenic old man, rather than a true-to-life retelling of Mozart's road to his early death. But it does paint the picture of 18th Century Vienna \\"tabloid gossip\\" of Mozart's mysterious downfall.<br />If you do your research, you'll find out about the truth about Mozart's death, who was there at his side, who completed that Requiem Mass, etc.  But the movie, is still a treasure.  The plot is brilliant, blending fact and fiction (the word \\"fiction\\" is a little iffy) and exemplifies the ongoing debate of the popularly mediocre to the \\"different\\" genius, underestimated and underappreciated during his own time.<br />There is enough fact in this film to call it a historical account (e.g. Mozart's struggle with the Archbishop, domestic tension between Conztanze and her father-in-law, the banning of ballet dancing, Marie Antoinette's growing fear of her people, etc.)<br />Visually, this movie scores a 100% in overall artistic appeal.  Filmed in the Czech Republic, you see palaces and streets that have remained unchanged since the time Mozart was alive.  Too bad Mozart's native Salzburg and Vienna have visually changed so much over the past couple of centuries.  The beautifully preserved Nostitz Theater in the film is even the same theater where Mozart premiered his opera Il Don Giovanni in 1789, arguably the best opera yet written.  This opera (and many others) are represented in the film, carefully and masterfully choreographed by Twyla Tharp who tried, very succesfully, to recapture the dances of the 18th Century.  Even the opera sets are believably \\"classical.\\"  Amadeus is cerainly a treat for the eyes, as well as the ears and mind.<br />This is not one of those costume films where the actors sound British.  The actors speak in North American dilect (with the exception of the actors that play the \\"Court people\\" of course) maximizing the American-viewer appeal.  The reason for the different dialects, the producers say, is because in 18th Century Europe, many dialects of one language were prevalent: \\"A West German would never be able to understand an East German.\\"  <br />Everything in the film looks just perfect: from the number of candles in the chandeliers, to the wigs, to the music, to the way the people talk. Also, Don't miss the \\"Amadeus: Director's Cut\\" with an additional 20 minutes of original scenes that were cut in 1984.  It was in theaters and the DVD should be out soon.  It helps make the cause of the feud between Constanze Mozart and Antonio Salieri more lucid.  Plusother scenes where the financially ruined Mozart stops a piano lesson-gone-wrong, and then beggs the student's father, a nobleman, for money.  Also, the opera sequences are lengthened.  The DVD release of the Director's Cut is not to be missed.<br />Amadeus (1984) is also a sure hit in trying to get young children interested in musical classics, especially if your kid's complaining about his or her boring piano lessons.  It is rated PG.  The Director's Cut has been rated R for brief nudity.
B000002HNR|4.0|As good as the sound and live recording is for \\"Absolutely Live\\", it only gets better on a more comprehensive and perhaps slightly better engineered \\"In Concert\\" double cd album.  Even the song order arranged here is maintained and duplicated on \\"In Concert\\".  Yet if you need a quick fix of live Doors music, or are an [avid] Doors collector (like me), than \\"Absolutely Live\\" will do the job.<br />But mind you, once you've also purchased \\"In Concert\\" with the exact song structure and recordings and more inclusive with Hollywood Bowl recordings and others from Alive She Cried, you will regret having purchased \\"Absolutely Live\\" in the first place.  Essentially, all three could be avoided purchases with a single \\"In Concert\\" purchase.  The Box Set would be the next logical purchase with even additional collections and a rarity set with select choices from \\"In Concert\\".<br />I do think the sound engineering is slightly clearer or less muted on \\"In Concert\\" than it is on \\"Absolutely Live\\".  Regardless, for a live recording both are enjoyable on an audiophile level of integrity.  But I say again, there is nothing you are missing here, only depriving yourself of what lays awaiting in the expanded selections of \\"In Concert\\".  My review there on May 31st is more descriptive and detailed of the very same recordings, albeit shortened, on \\"Absolutely Live\\".
B000002UAX|5.0|Speaking as an 18 year old Beatles fan, I have to say first off that the White Album speaks for itself. It's a masterpiece, and just because a few ignorant reviewers (who over half the time got their information skewered) don't like it just goes to show thatYOU CAN'T PLEASE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME. That said, let's take the masterpiece the White Album disk by disk.<br />DISK ONE: Although I like every song on the White Album except for \\"Long Long Long\\" (sorry George, it's just a peculiar little song), I consider disk one to be the better of the two. John had reached his psychedelic peak (which is a GOOD thing!), Paul was writing beautiful songs, George was beginning to blossom into a wonderful songwriter, and Ringo was starting to be recognized. All of that shows on disk one. Even though they were fighting, the Beatles were at their best!<br />DISK TWO: I may have said that disk one is my favorite, but that doesn't mean that disk two is weak. The reason people don't like it is that the music is different- perhaps a little too ahead of its time. BUT DON'T LET THAT SCARE YOU OFF! The best songs on disk two (in my opinion) are as follows: Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, and tracks nine through thirteen (Honey Pie to Good Night). Although John was almost totally focused on YUKKO Ono at the time, his love songs, you have to admit, bring a psychedelic look on their love.<br />Would I recommend this album? If you are a Beatles fan, buy it. It's probably one of their three best. (other than Sgt. Pepper, of course, Abbey Road, and Revolver) Anyone who likes the individual talents of the fab four will love this album.<br />Now I HAVE to get this off my chest before I close: As one reviewer said, Revolution 9 is the most hated Beatles track ever. It's also one of the most misunderstood. For those musical snobs out there who think that music must be cut and dry, here's what Revolution 9 is REALLY about:<BR>  John HIMSELF said that it is a musical representation of his life, from birthto current days with the Beatles. It is NOT random noises, it is not just banging (as another ignorant reviewer said), it is a masterpiece which is GREATLY misunderstood, probably because it's ahead of its time. Music doesn't HAVE to involve actual musical instruments playing, or voices singing.<br />Thank you for your time. I can't tell you YOU MUST LIKE THE BEATLES AND THE WHITE ALBUM, because people have done that already with me at school. Follow your heart when it comes to which album to buy, but I highly recommend the WA.<BR>                                        \\"Ringo\\"<BR>                                         WMHS
B00005Y228|5.0|I never thought that I would own a Kylie Minogue CD. I've heard about her music a couple of years back but I never really took any interest. Until now that is! I was very surprised to find out that Kylie's been singing since the late `80s and has several albums out. Anyway I was first introduced to Kylie Minogue with this CD, FEVER. The title fits perfectly to this CD `cause it is hot. Hot on the grooves that is. FEVER is a very up-beat collection of sexy dance numbers.<br />Kylie purrs on each and every track with sexy come-hither lines like \\"now shall I remove my clothes\\" on \\"fever\\". She doesn't over do it either. It all begins with \\"more more more\\", a high energy disco-pop track. Kylie's vocals match the beat with perfect sync. \\"Love at first sight\\" continues the fun. And who could forget \\"can't get you out of my head\\". I don't think anyone can now. FEVER is hot, sexy, fun and up-beat. There are no ballads here. The only thing that comes sorta close is \\"fragile\\" and \\"your love\\". I guess you could call them dance-floor ballads. <br />I was very pleased that I bought this CD. I didn't expect that I would enjoy it as much as I did. It's a great collection of dance songs to get your feet happy. There isn't a bad song among this bunch.
0201633612|4.0|Contains many design patterns, and explains many of them through a very thorough example of building a word processor. The only problem with the book is that at first it's hard to understand for those who have no idea what design patterns are...
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album \\"Let Go\\" is a giant leap for females in the music industry.  With this album she shows her masculine rock side, but without \\"losing grip\\" with her female feelings.  This album expresses Avril as a real person not some disposable pop star who was created for the sole purpose of record sales.  Her realism and individuality is what makes this CD so amazing.  When asked to have her songs written for her, she strongly refused and took on the album for herself which is something very few artists do these days.  There have been reports that this CD was overproduced, to that I say put Britney Spears and Avril Lavigne in a room and within the first few moments you will see who is the stronger singer and artist.  Avril would crush the \\"overprotected\\" overproduced princess of Pop.
B000058T5E|5.0|Beck's killer signature tone and chops are in full splendor, and this CD grows on you more and more with each listen. It's worth the price just to get his rendition of \\"Nadia\\", one of those tunes that trancends music. \\"Roy's Toy\\" is a great driving tune. Jeff has integrity, and it comes through his music. He hasn't sold out to beer, car and shoe commercials like his peers have.
0553579908|5.0|The is the second (The first being \\"A Game of Thrones\\") in a series that has rejuvenated my interested in medieval fantasy as a genre.  The characters are realistic and compelling.  The plot is continually surprising.  And, it's mature and avoids the usual fantasy mistakes of 30 pound swords and other such rubbish.<br />The general plot involves a reworking of the War of the Roses in a fantasy world, though there is much more happening that doesn't become completely apparent until this book.  If anything, this one is better than the first. I cannot recommend this series too highly.  Read it at once.
B00004ZD69|5.0|I'm going to pull a Keanue Reeves here and simply respond to this amazing piece of work with that one word in my review title.<br />Not in a long time has an album moved me as much as Lift Your Skinny Fists. The juxtaposition of strings with distorted, ringing guitars and sometimes funk-influenced (see the second CD; the DJ Shadow reference one reviewer mentioned is pretty right on), straight-forward drum breaks is amazing. Each piece of music is about twenty minutes long with the music building, falling apart, and starting anew. The first song on the second CD is worth the price alone. One of the most haunting, beautiful songs I've heard.<br />The plethora of negative reviews is a little shocking to me. Godspeed's music on Lift Your Skinny Fists... constantly changes and moves in different direction so the \\"boring soft-to-crescendo\\" factor some mention is a little odd to me especially with the last track on the second CD. And I can't possibly see how some could see this CD as being bad enough to earn one-star. <br />Ignore the negativity on the review page and get this. This is not something to miss out on.
B00002522A|5.0|this is the _only_ Dark Tranquility album. Well, that's not true. It is quite possibly the best though. These guys invented the Gothenburg sound along with At The Gates, In Flames, Carcass, and maybe someone else, so please love them! Keep it true- not nu.
0783229321|5.0|Classic 1978 comedy from young director John Landis. Frat parties would never be the same. Toga parties might not have been born in this movie, but they became a national sensation in the late 1970's and 80's thanks to Blutarsky & Co. Count the soon-to-be-stars that came out of this film... John Belushi (all ready a 'SNL' star), Tim Matheson, Tom Hulce, Kevin Bacon, Karen Allen, Bruce McGill... and check out Otis Day's band with a young Robert Cray playing the bass guitar. You'll notice there are no massive explosions or on-screen computer trickery... yet this comedy still holds up nicely decades later. This film relies on sight gags, some gross humor and brilliant comic writing and imagination. \\"Animal House\\" will always and forever be one step above Double Secret Probation. A stand-out comedy classic.
B000066NW0|5.0|If you're in the mood for some awesome fun and great music that's not heavy and not soft, Avril Lavigne's CD &quot;Let Go&quot; is definitely the way to go. This CD is a great inspiration and it's wonderful to see how Avril has written her own songs and taught herself the guitar and has so much confidence in herself to do all this. She believes in herself so much and its a great influence to everyone out there! There aren't many people who do WHAT they want, WHEN they want and express their feelings through songwriting, while slamming away on their guitar. Her songs are not only so genuine, but so talented. Who knew one's life can turn out to be something to teach others for the better? Her lyrics are wonderful and you could feel what she was feeling right at that moment, and what she felt while she was writing them. Avril is a great influence to people everywhere because she's not out there selling herself--she's out there selling her music. This CD has many stories behind it and you won't know any of the stories unless you buy yourself a copy. Its worth it, and if you don't take it from me, take it from everyone else who feel the exact same way as I do.
B00006690F|5.0|You know, the one thing out of many things that I have learned in my lifetime is that hating is a sickness.  And anyone who thinks otherwise has got to be a sick puppy.  But I will not make that the crutch of my review, because people are people and they are entitled to their own opinion.  But please, don't hate, instead be constructive.  Say why you didn't like.  Anyway....<br />I am rap fan since the 80's.  I love rap.  Rap is the music that I was raised on from Eric B & Rakim to Tupac to Eightball & MJG.  I have heard it all (from east to west to south).  And Eminem's (and company) attempt at \\"The Eminem Show\\" was spectacular.  From his beats to his lyrics, this CD is going to be a classic.  Like most CD's we buy these days, there is always a couple of tracks on the CD that we just don't like.  But I can honestly say, that there is not one track on this CD that I could just skip past everytime I played the CD.  And it has been a long time since I have been able to say that.<br />Now I must admit that some of beats on the CD were a little \\"risky\\" and almost made me skip the song, but Eminem's lyrical genuis made me listen.  Eminem is going to be a great rapper, because he knows how to tell a story and throw it right in your face without any extra crap or wasted lyrics, like most of the mainstream rappers these days.  I almost gave up on rap until Eminem keep me running.<br />Without becoming to fan-crazed let me just say plainly, this is not a wasted buy.  I have played this CD so much that I have not even had a chance to see the DVD yet.  In fact I might of lost the DVD, but I don't care because the CD is just that good.  <br />Just because in the song \\"Without Me\\", Eminem called Moby a bald-headed faggot and that techno is dead, people want to hate.  Listen up haters: Don't make mountains out of anthills.  It was one verse!!!!  [Which was probably true.  I don't know I don't listen to techno.]<br />Go get the Eminem CD (\\"The Eminem Show\\") - You won't regret it.<br />Peace, until next time<BR>(Please excuse any grammatically errors.  I was busy at work when I wrote this.)
B00000K19E|5.0|when i walked out of the movie, i was thinking to myself:&quot;why can't movies be as good as this&quot;. the matrix brings everything action,horror,romance, even a little bit of comedy from keanu(his acting!). the DVD is action packed with many special features. I have the special revisted DVD which i highly recommend to pick up because of its very in depth stuff. so overall, matrix is the best movie to date,PERIOD!
B00005QHPQ|2.0|Why hasn't anyone noticed the boy can't sing! Granted the kid is cute, but without that he'd be nowhere.  He also needs to get over himself. There are so many other young latin singers that are far better than he, but don't have the looks OR the name Iglesias.
B000002JKA|5.0|Probably my favorite Dream Theater album, and the only 70+ minute album by this band that I can actually listen to in one sitting without getting annoyed. Awake is perhaps the band's heaviest outing, but also the album of theirs with the most subtleties. Kevin Moore's keyboard work is more restrained and tasteful than in Images and Words (to say nothing of Jordan Rudess' recent work with the band), and John Petrucci seems to do a little less flailing as well. The album moves from the heavy alterna-rock of the few opening cuts to the delicate (but still interesting) balladry of &quot;The Silent Man&quot; to the crushing progressive metal of &quot;The Mirror&quot; and &quot;Lie&quot;. Unfortunately the two 10-minute-plus would-be epics are a little short on ideas, and LaBrie's vocals seem to be the worst in these two cuts, but I have few complaints about the rest of the songs. Of note are the instrumental &quot;Erotomania&quot; (lauded by many for its complexities); the aforementioned ultra-heavy &quot;The Mirror&quot;/&quot;Lie&quot; combo, with its extremely effective and bone-crunching transition between songs; and the closer, &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;, a repetitive piano-driven atmospheric vocal track that one would think would get boring after just a couple of listens, but for some reason doesn't - if anything it gets better. With the possible exception of the debut album (which I don't like mostly because of the vocalist), Awake is the DT release most likely to please progressive rock fans, I think. Good stuff.
0312265859|2.0|I fell in love with the Stephanie Plum series from the start, but feel it peaked at about #3.  I still rush out to buy a new entry on the day it's published, but... I think I'll stop now.  After books worth of anticipation, Stephanie's encounter with Ranger is anticlimactic; her relationship with Joe has almost reached an adult-like maturity; and the constant rehashing of past events (books) is a bore.  Something has gone very wrong with this terrific character and I sure hope Ms.Evanovich can resusitate her.
B000066NW0|5.0|OK.  As far as I am concerned Avril Lavigne is the best new artist out there.  Her CD &quot;Let Go&quot; Shows all sides of avril and expresses her true feelings.  All of the music is uplifting and would make any listener want to get up and Jam to all her songs.  I have yet to listen to the radio since I bought this album because I can't seem to be able to LET GO of this CD.  I absolutely love this Cd and Avril.  I fully recomend this awesome album to any person alive.  <br />Peace out and Rock on.<br />Avsman3486
B000066NW0|5.0|Britney What? Mandy Who? move over singing dancing pop princesses Avril Lavigne's here and shes more than just a pretty face...her style and talent surpasses that of any female artist this decade.

B000021YQV|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard. Now, I'll have to come out honest, when I first heard System of a Down, I didn't like their song, &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, because I'm not usually into that kind of faced-paced, fast talking type of music...It usually gives me a headache. Though I do like rock, not normally that fast. But once &quot;Toxicity&quot; (the song,) came out, I really liked it...it grew on me, but I ended up liking it. I heard it enough on the radio until one day I decided, &quot;O.K., just buy the CD,&quot; so I went ahead and did it...knowing that when I do this, most CDs I haven't heard yet sound really bad..heh...only one or two songs are usually good. But, this one is good all the way through. It's awesome. They mix heavy riffs with sort of a middle-eastern sound...and it's really unique. They're just a really awesome, unique band. My favorite songs would have to be &quot;ATWA,&quot; &quot;Aerials,&quot; &quot;Science,&quot; and of course, &quot;Toxicity.&quot; 'Science' though, is awesome. Oh, enough of my blabbing...just by the album! :D
1583762027|5.0|I am a big fan of Brian Tracy, but this book is incredible.  There is valuable information packed into every chapter, it is the type of book that you will read and then continue to re-read over and over again to get some great insight.<br />He tells you how to do tasks that you would like to put off, but he puts them in a way of thinking that it makes sense to get over your procrastination and start making lists and steps to get those goals accomplished.<br />Must read for anyone that wants to work on their increased productivity in life.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I bought this CD because I liked the song &quot;Last Nite&quot; and read that the album was very good. I don't know what the critics are thinking, because &quot;Last Nite&quot; is one of the few listenable songs on this album. The album is horrendous and the hype of the Strokes will fizzle out soon I'm sure.<br />The new song/video &quot;Hard to Explain&quot; is a better representation of how horrible this album is. The sound is awful, all the songs have that muted singing and bad production. The Strokes sound is extremely annoying. It seems like they are just trying to be hip and trendy while their music stinks. I don't really see any musical talent here, I was shocked at how bad the songwriting is on this album. I also had no idea that all the songs on this album would have that annoying muted singing like on &quot;Last Nite&quot;. It works on that song, but it gets old real quick when listening to the rest of the CD. Overall, the music sounds very uninspired and forced.<br />In review, this was one of the biggest disappointments I have ever heard. I really did/do like &quot;Last Nite&quot; but that's really the only bright spot on this album. There's maybe 2 or 3 other songs I can sit through that are mediocre. <br />Sorry, just telling you the truth here. I give it 2 stars only for &quot;Last Nite&quot;, otherwise it gets a 1.

B000063S6Z|1.0|This is by far the worst so-called artist I have ever seen. I just don't understand why people give such positive reviews. Those are the people who don't know what music is at all. <br />Like Rolling Stone's review described, there's a person who doesn't look or sound anything of music. However, since his music is nothing of music, it must be something. Sadly, this is the whole deal of this \\"artist\\" and album.<br />His voice is so less than ordinary that every song in this album has to be mingled deeply in the weirdo techno music. I just couldn't understand why people even pay attention to this \\"artist\\" after all. The matter of fact is, when you see great artists like Aerosmith, U2, and Creed all around you like so many Rolls Royce, it might be a change to take a peep at a poor, distorted pickup truck. <br />Eminem criticize this \\"artist\\" in a hush way in his brand new album. While I feel deserving for this artist to be described by those cursing lyrics, one thing should be clear, the attack didn't come out of nowhere. Why didn't U2 or Aerosmith come under such attacks? The answer is, they are good, and they are genuine artists who are nothing less than being the best. <br />As for this \\"artist\\" and album, I really don't know what to say, except, you could if you want to try it for yourself, chances are, you will likely be disappointed big time.
0312265859|5.0|I always knew there was some benefit to living on this side of the itnernational dateline - HARD EIGHT hit the book stores yesterday morning and I finished it this morning. Mind you, I probably need to go back and reread it since I was just so compelled to turn the pages that my eyeballs could hardly keep up. I really did enjoy this book: Scariest bad guy since Ramirez roamed the earth, an endearing lawyer (yes, really!) and the usual wonderful cast of characters. Do I comment on the Joe vs Ranger debate? Nope, I give away nothing but suffice to say I am satisfied and Stephanie (lucky girl) certainly seems to be.Janet E. has managed to find(in my opinion) a way to make everyone happy! Must admit I wondered if it could be done but it sure does work for me. Happy day for all Plum fans!
B000003CVX|5.0|Eine Alpensinfonie dates from a time and place now past when a respected composer could literally write for any orchestral forces he desired.  It is scored for a huge orchestra (150 instruments, by one count--although not 150 different instrumental parts) and includes hecklephone, windmachine, thundermachine, tenor tubas, and 20(!) French horns--12 are offstage and play only in 21 measures of the piece, for less than one minute. It is a veritable bible of orchestration--Strauss is a master of handling huge forces, surpassed only by Gustav Mahler, and that arguably. But Strauss's layers of counterpoint and his textural conceptions can suffer at the hands of overenthusiastic performers or an insufficiently aware conductor.  Andre Previn and the Vienna Philharmonic prove themselves more than capable, though, and this is an absolutely beautiful performance that always brings tears to my eyes.  Following the score while listening to this recording demonstrates an astonishing clarity of performance in such a complex score, and if the low brass tone crests a bit on occasion it is surely Strauss's intention--otherwise he would not have written two trombones and two tubas on a pedal G (!) fortissimo.  That passage cannot and should not be played delicately--trust me, I'm a trombonist.  Worthier of note are the fantastic performances by the first trumpet, who Strauss treats as almost superhuman; the gorgeous horn/tenor tuba section, and the fantastically lush sound overall.  The performance is not without flaws, but the problems are minor indeed and issues of interpretation--for example, at the very ending Previn does not observe Strauss's fermata, and the violins never really glissando noticeably where Strauss indicates to do so.  The final interval of a twelfth (a compound fifth, from F at the top of the treble clef staff to Bb below the staff) is marked glissando; what is meant here is a slide from one note to the next, without break, and consequentially the F and the notes before it will likely be played on the G string, resulting in a dark sound very appropriate for the ending of the piece (the ending section is even titled \\"Night\\").  But the Vienna Philharmonic, or Previn, or both, see it otherwise.  The glissando is inaudible to me, there is no connection between the penultimate and the final note, and the final phrase is not, I believe, played on the G string at all.  Still, this is quite a subtle distinction and not one that significantly mars the overall performance of truly deep and powerful music.<br />Strauss has been criticized for being overly programmatic and literal, writing trivial music and being derivative of Richard Wagner and Gustav Mahler.  Whatever truth these criticisms hold, the fact remains that Wagner, Mahler and Strauss revolutionized music.  Aside from their already well-known harmonic innovations and orchestral mastery, they freed melody from its primarily vocal conception, which had limited it from its origin.  Where most composers before them would follow a large leap with motion in the opposite direction, thereby restricting the melodic line in musical space, these three composed great soaring lines in which a large leap might well be followed by another leap or stepwise motion in the same direction.  The resulting themes often surpass the range of a single instrument; a given melody might, for example, begin in the tuba doubled with bassoon, celli and contrabasses, move to French horns and finally end in the upper registers of flutes, oboes, and violins.  Orchestration becomes not simply an assigning of instruments to particular lines, but an inseparable part of the composition of a piece.  Whatever flaws Strauss's music might have (and I have to admit that the Storm Scene in the Alpine Symphony, with its wind and thunder machines and the portrayal of raindrops in the pizzicato strings is too cliched for my taste), its glories far surpass them.<br />It is a bit of a shame that nothing is coupled with the Alpine Symphony--at only 48 minutes this disc is a bit slim; and I think that Death and Transfiguration would have made a stunning companion piece.  But perhaps Previn and Vienna have already released a version of that work, at any rate, even alone this is an excellent performance of a glorious piece and well worth owning.the Alpine Symphony--at only 48 minutes this disc is a bit slim; and I think that Death and Transfiguration would have made a stunning companion piece.

0425180638|4.0|Kay Scarpetta has been stagnating as a character for at least the last two novels.  Her dark, self-destructive charactaristics have become less and less believable in a character that is supposed to be a busy, intellegent professional.  The Last Precinct finally sees Dr. Scarpetta confronted with her past and the psychologically damaging experience of her lovers death and of her particular profession.  Now if she could just be portrayed as a relatively healthy person, this series would become highly readable again.
0312265859|5.0|Hard Eight delivers Stephanie Plum and her zany supporting cast wrapped in murder, mayham and mystery--and you will laugh all the way through the book.  Hard Eight is a little weak on plot and it starts out a bit slow, but Evanovich hits her stride about three or four chapters in and the rest of the book is fast-paced and delightful.  In this book we get a little more insight into Ranger.  If you are a Stephanie Plum fan, you won't be disappointed!  And if this is your first encounter with the errant bounty hunter, you'll be hooked.
0790730960|4.0|Tim Burton's second Batman film is much darker than the first, yet still satisfying, popcorn-munching fun, with an apt blend of comic book action and trademark Burton weirdness. With Michael Keaton returning as the bat, Danny DeVito as the creepy pengiun and Michelle Pfeiffer as the sexy Catwoman, Batman Returns has everything fans could want. The styilised look of Gotham City is fantastic. Danny Elfman's exciting yet creepy score fits perfectly with the film's tone. Having proven his abstract humour to great effect with Frankenweenie (1985) and Beetlejuice (1988), Burton works his magic to superb effect. The only thing amiss is the plot, but that hardly matters when it's Burton at the helm, and a sharp script and some witty one-liners make up for it's flaws. The DVD presentation is dissapointing, with absoulutly nothing for fans! Not even a trailer! When will Warner Brothers learn?
0451169514|5.0|This was an awsome book! One of my favorites, and although it was long and slow at times, it keeps you reading constantly. There is always something you didn't expect. The story is about a bunch of kids and their fight against evil. Something that you should be aware of is that there is death of children, that my bother some parents, but like most King books, even children aren't safe. But something that is really improtant for anyone who has watched the movie and is thinking that the book might be cheesy you're so wrong. This book is so much better then the movie could be, there are just some things you can't get from movies.
B0000640VN|4.0|They say that opposites attract, which proves true for Kate and Leopold. Both beautiful Kate, and sexy Leopold, are bold and brave. But otherwise, they have quite different personalities, are from different eras of time, have different ideas about jobs and the part that morality plays in continuing to work a particular job... all of which made watching them together more fun. Kate's ex reminded me of \\"the Doc\\" from \\"Back to the Future,\\" because of his many funny misfortunes but likeability. Kate's brother successfully helps Leopold to shine as Leopold demonstrates his romantic tips and points Kate's brother in the right direction. But can Leopold's attractive mannerisms and romantic views sway Kate to his way of thinking, or is there some way to compromise to allow BOTH their ways of thinking to merge? Or will he have to return to his own time, back to his \\"Duke\\" position and choose a bride whom he does not love? Will Kate ever realize her feelings for Leopold, or will her job prove to be more important? Watch and find out!
B000002OG8|5.0|If 1970s rock and roll is a continuum between the Rolling Stones on one end (punkish, growling, immediate) and ELP, Yes, and Renaissance on the other end (esoteric, long-form, &quot;meaningful&quot;), Wishbone Ash always tended a little more toward latter.  &quot;Argus&quot; is a perfect example.<br />This record (for so it was) could be seen as a &quot;concept&quot; album.  There is a theme of war and rememberance that runs through the entire work.<br />What set is apart is the extraordinary instrumentation.  The twin lead guitars complement one another, rather than competing.  &quot;Throw Down the Sword&quot; is arguably the best song on the album, featuring an organ backing by John Tout of the band Renaissance.<br />If you did not grow up on early 1970s rock, it's a roll of the dice whether you'd like this CD or not; but if you enjoy serious-minded music by people who really love what they're doing, this is a safe bet, IMHO.
B00005JLEX|5.0|All Seinfeld episodes on DVD is a MUST HAVE for any TV sit-com fan.  Never has there been a better written, cast, acted and directed situation comedy.  Although I miss new episodes I commend Jerry and crew for calling it quits while they were still on top.  What fabulous characters they created together.  Great on-screen relationships.  Tops all ensembles ever!
0140277447|5.0|This book tells the story of what is undisputedly the Worlds most horrific and disgusting massacre the World has ever seen in modern times. Never have I read such horrific text that physically made me want to vomit. <br />The fact that other readers, notably Japanese are disgusted with the publication of this book only adds to their ignorance. They are however not to be blamed. The Japanese government has deleted all references and records with regards to the Nanjing massacre from its history books and japanese children today grow up learning from 'japonified' texts portraying their country to be nothing but less than the 'goodies' of the world.<br />It is important we do not forget the past, it is essential to both understanding the present and shaping the future.
6305531412|4.0|Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Castaway), Who Framed Roger Rabbit is an eye-popping delight for kids and adults alike with it's clever comedy, inventive animation and seamless cartoon interactions with the actors. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd are great, and the combination of cartoonish humour creates a nuance that woks well. Alan Silversti's lively score suits the film's tone, using the same themes as Back to the Future yet bringing new \\"cartoony\\" music to the film. The brilliant combination of effortlessly clever humour and high-sprited fun make this one a superb classic.<br />This \\"special edition\\" DVD is very dissapointing in the way of extras though, with no features of any kind, not even a trailer! This could be forgiven if the sound and picture quality wasn't so shoddy! Thankfully, a re-release issue will be out later this year....
B00004TWZF|5.0|One of the best movies out about the sport of freediving. I am a novice in the sport and have been diving my whole life. This movie opened my eyes to something else, something better.
0312265859|4.0|In this, the eighth Stephanie Plum novel, we get exactly what we have come to know and love about the other seven books in the series.  Stephanie wisecracks her way through one scrape after another, aided and abetted by Morelli, Ranger, Lula, and of course Grandma Mazur.<br />Stephanie is called on to help her parents' neighbor, Mabel, for reasons involving a child custody bond.  But there's dirty work afoot, and soon Stephanie is, as usual, up to her neck in everything from spiders to \\"bunnies.\\"  There's even a guest appearance by by Bob, the large and perpetually nauseated dog.<br />I can honestly say this is NOT the worst book I've read recently.<br />Now that I've damned with faint praise, let me be specific about a few things...<br />1)  The Morelli/Ranger will-they-or-won't-they routine is a tad stale.<br />2)  At least once per book, Stephanie is assigned to pick up someone who is predestined to get away several times before she hauls him/her in to face the music.  It's a little old.<br />3)  The ending is breathtakingly abrupt.  The McGuffin in the story, which I will not reveal here, is something of a letdown.<br />4)  I love her wisecracking, but I'd love to see, JUST ONCE, a really dark entry in the series.  Nothing too bad, but it's too much like Moonlighting at times.<br />Of course, Moonlighting was a delight, and so (for the most part) is this book.  It's the literary equivalent of comfort food, earning four stars easily.  I didn't go with five stars because there is no new ground broken here.<br />If you've read any of the other books in this series and found them worthwhile, you'll no doubt enjoy this one.  For all its faults, it's a welcome return visit from an old friend, Stephanie Plum.  Long may she roam the streets of the Burg, in search of elusive FTAs.
B0000542DJ|5.0|If you only ever listen to one commentary on a DVD, it should be this one.<br />First off, I'll just let you know that I'm leaving my opinions out of this review. Just take three hours and sit down and watch this movie. If thats all you take from it, then that is fine. If, for some reason, this movie inspires you to head to your local library and write a few request letters to the National Archives, then you have truly found the meaning of Oliver Stone's film JFK. This is not a rewriting of history, it is an interpretation by a man who put 4 plus years of research into the work and uncovered as many new leads and facts as anyone had in the twenty years prior.<br />It is amazing how many of the so-called \\"made up facts\\" and \\"rewriting of history\\" has been proven to be correct in the subsequent releases by the house sub-committee on assasinations and the freedom of information acts committee reviews following the release of the film in the early and mid 1990s. Thank Stone and this films controversialities for much of the information you now have about the JFK assasination. Put the facts together for yourself, they would expect you to believe everything you see and read. There are many books and resources on this and many websites where you can read or listen to the actual testimonies, I would ask all those who slam this film to do the same. Do a little free-minded investigation of your own. Good luck.
B00005QDW1|1.0|I didn't like any song on this cd I was extremly disappointed cuz Im a huge No doubt fan But the old stuff is way better!!! So if ur lookin for some tight rock Try Tragic Kingdom or Return 2 saturn cuz Rock Steady isnt cuttin it.
B000066C1N|5.0|If I could give the album 10 stars that would surely indicate just how credible and incredible this soundtrack is!<BR>  I read all the reviews that have been posted so far and other than the one or two negative reviews you should not think twice about purchasing this soundtrack. Hans Zimmer hits another homerun...possibly a grand-slam. It's that good........buy it......now!!! I also am a tremendous Adams fan but interestingly enough no one has mentioned Mutt Lange being involved with this project. He, as he has done with so many others made Bryan Adams what he is today. Probably the greatest<BR>pop/rock producer of all times has certainly influenced the sound of this soundtrack....listen closely and you can pick Mutt's influence out real easily. What a momentous collaboration between the three of them. <BR>    This is a perfect addition to anyones music library....I only wish I could get all of Zimmers work from the film. Have to wait till the DVD is out unless we are all fortunate enough to have a follow up of more music from \\"Spirit\\". It's that good.....buy it......now.
B000066NW0|3.0|Her voice is real good. She also has some catchy tune in every song. Her lyrics are just plain shallow but still catchy. I have a hard time to remember which one is my favorite song after listening a few times because they sound pretty much alike in every song.<br />I listen to it non-stop the first 2 day and now I am bored. Have to go back to Michelle Branch CD again. That girl's CD is always in my CD player!
6305313687|4.0|I won't classify this as a review, more of an after thought of the movie.<br />I've watched 'American History X' three times. First time at the cinema, once at a friend's place and most recently, at my brother's home (he hasn't seen this movie before). Each time I watched it, each time I marvelled at the intricate character portrayal and intense subject matter of this film. If anything, it's an indication of a great movie for me.<br />Brilliant performances by both 'Edwards' who paired up as credible onscreen siblings.<br />Sure, racism is nothing new and some may scorn at the propagandistic approach of this film. To me, every good movie has a story to tell and a message to bring across. 'American History X' doesn't just tap on racial discrimination, it tackles on issues like family, social problems, and education at a rather poignant level as well. Before we start getting too critical about the relevance of this film, let us not forget that this is afterall a fictional story, not a documentary. There will be imperfections and loop holes. But for what it's worth and what it trys to achieve out of it, this film deserves our kudos.<br />What I feel is most significant about the film personally in terms of its message is this: when you act insensibly in life and end up hurting yourself, you always end up hurting someone else along with you. Your actions may sometimes have a far more sinister repercussion than you expect. As the youngest child in the family, I suppose I've always looked up to my elder brother as a mentor, probably the same way Danny (Furlong) looked up to his (Norton). Perhaps another reason why I like this film so much is because of the strong bond between the brothers and the impact each has on the other - something which I can relate to.
B000066NW0|5.0|What can I say Avril Lavigne is going to a major element in music! Her CD Let go is not only a spiritual ride but it gives you an insight on the girl behind the music. At the age of 17 and already making music that touches people on such a profound level. I can't even begin to fathom what she will do years from now. With such a brilliant mind to write about how you can be with someone and as soon as they are around some body else you think to your self \\"Why do you have to do this why can't you just be yourself?\\" It shows how much people will change just to be liked. Avril's next single Sk8er Boi is not only a fast fun song but also give the message not to judge people on what they look like or what they do for fun. This song will be the song that opens a whole new door for the music world. In Avril's CD you will get the sense that Avril isn't going to change for anyone or anything. That she stands on her ground and she stands on it firm. She doesn't go out there and talk about how what she is going to have to do to get a boy to leave with her. She can actually play the music and not just sing it. Avril is going to change the music standards of today with her powerful lyrics and her catchy rhythms.  If I can give you any insight at all it would be that this is an amazing CD. Everybody should keep it in there CD Player!
0312265859|5.0|... I love to escape into the world of Janet Evanovich. Janet's writing takes me away from the real world and into the adventures of her characters.

B000006NPY|4.0|The Pumpkins' much underrated release is indeed a departure from previous albums, but its not necesarily a step in the wrong direction. Adore is a beeping electronic pulse, filled with tales of true love, lost love, and everything in between. While it doesn't effect you the way Gish or Siamese Dream does, it succeeds in creating a luscious atmosphere filled with otherworldy sonics. The lead &quot;Ava Adore&quot; beeps with its obsession and is easily accessible as &quot;Today&quot; or &quot;1979&quot;. While its not as strong as the previous ones, the pumpkins manage to loop, plop, and scratch their way into your heart. &quot;Perfect&quot; is a little dull, and it sounds too sure of itself, but other than that, Adore is worth purchasing..I cant really say the same for Machina.
B000065U1N|1.0|This is a terrible movie that needs to be more responsible about what it is implying (that the somali people should have just been grateful we were there). But it looks really good. Looks like Ridley Scott did the visuals and Jerry Bruckheimer was in charge of the cliched script. Isn't there anything new to say about soldiers in battle besides everything we've seen or heard in Rambo (&quot;we not leaving anyone behind&quot;) or Saving Private Ryan (&quot;tell my mom...&quot;)?

0312265859|5.0|Readers of the series will not be disappointed - this one is absolutely hilarious, and all our favorite characters turn up for some fun and mayhem.  New readers will appreciate the humor, but not, perhaps, some plot points which refer to the story of books one through seven.  Haven't laughed so hard at a book in ages - and Grandma Mazur fans are in for a special treat!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is the coolest singer around. She's knockin out all the other poser gurl singers and takin the music charts by storm. Her lyrics are so meaningful and people love her for that. Her CD is great!! Such songs as &quot;Complicated&quot; and &quot;I'm with you&quot; relate so much to her fans that they cannot wait for her next album to come out and see what other kind of things are on her heart that she wants heard in her music. Avril is truly one of a kind and if you didnt already buy her CD, then you should really do so now. If you dont, then you will regret it!! I promise you that. ~Keep the Avril Pride Alive!~

B00005JKCF|5.0|I can't believe J. Shannon's review: third place after Superman and Batman! There is no match: for sure Batman falls well behind Spiderman. Spiderman delivers far more fun, more action, more character development, more realism (the New York setting is much better than the gothic/appalling Gotham City), more entertainment, more thrill, more! <BR>Tobey is a perfect Spiderman and the movie is the one you could see again many times. Batman is too dark and boring. <BR>Superman was nearly perfect for its time, as much as Spiderman is for ours. So I would put Spidey at the first place, together with Superman with a second place reserved to X-Man... for sure NOT Batman!<BR>2002 CGI is not perfect, of course, and Episode II is the clear example (the incredibly unreal Anakin riding the monster in the arena sequence is unbelievable from a Lucas movie!), but I was less distracted from Spiderman's CGI than by the Episode II scenes.<BR>I can't wait to see Spiderman \\"flying\\" again through NY buildings.

079284632X|1.0|For many, many years I heard nothing but great reviews about this movie.  I heard it was one of the scariest movies of all times.  This excited me because I am a huge fan of older horror films so I bought the tape.  What a disappointment.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  Absolutly terrible.  I found it to be more of a comedy than anything else.  It's just plain stupid and quite boring.  Do yourself a favor, stay away from this movie.
0316153826|4.0|I liked this book more than the black echo(1st in the series).  Maybe because i like bosch as a character and connely didn't have to go into detail explaining him as in the previous book.<BR>Black ice again has twists that seem to not be able to link together, but eventually do.  It starts a little slower and some of the reasoning is hard to follow, but it all works out in the end.  Connely seems to enjoy adding many different twists and subplots to make a point.
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaiman's 'Neverwhere' is a delight from start to finish. Richard Mayhew, a young Scot living and working in London, finds himself helping a young girl lying in a street who is being pursued by two sinister looking men. Reluctantly, he finds himself being drawn into a tangled web of a plot that leads him to an London Below, a London that exists both beneath London and as a parallel alternative universe London, a London where people live who \\"fall through the cracks.\\" This London is highly inventive, richly detailed, and, despite the unrealness of it, convincing. I, for one, will never be able to take the London Underground again and wonder about the trains with darkened windows that go though the stations without stopping - Do they carry the court of the Earl on it? And how did Earl's Court get its name? Or Baron's Court, for that matter? I shall certainly never go to Harrods or go on board HMS Belfast without thinking of the Floating Market. London Below is peopled with colourful and strange characters - The Lady Door, The Marquis de Carabas, Hunter, The Angel Islington, and many others, including the menacing Mr Vandemar and Mr Croup. This is the sort of book that Michael Moorcock would be writing if he was still writing decent books. Even if you don't know London, this book is still wonderful - you will want to get to know it. The story is gripping and the writing is vivid and sharp. I cannot recommend it highly enough. Gaiman, by far, is the best writer writing fantasy today.
B00006690F|5.0|Let me say this right from the start, if you're looking for the all out bash-fest from Em, don't buy this record, just stick to the Marshall Mathers LP. Em comes out with some intelligence in his third installment as the greatest MC of our generation. Don't listen to the pathetic Moby fan who reviewed this cd as a one-star affair, he's just mad that Em put that punk in his place. From the opening track to the final skit, this cd is about as good as a cd can possibly be. Em doesn't attack people for the hell of it, as he had on previous records, instead this album plays out much more like a journal. The lyrics on this album are awesome, the beats are by far the best to date since Em himself produced most of this album, and the message behind the music is the most thoughtful it has ever been from Em. \\"Hailie's Song\\" is a song he wrote to his daughter(Em actually pulls of this semi-ballad), and it is such a good reminder that Em is actually a human being and loves his daughter just as you or I would. He's not the monster that he once portraid, and he proves it again on the song entitled, \\"Cleaning out my closet\\" in which he goes a little deeper into the actual feud with his mother, instead of just bashing her as he did on the Slim Shady LP. Overall, the best Eminem record to date, and anyone with a true appriciation for Hip-Hop will appriciate his growth as an artist, and anyone too immature to value that growth or the change of view in his music will appriciate it someday. Get the record, you'll like it sooner or later
B00003CX9E|5.0|The titular Kane is a newspaper baron that starts off young, impetuous, and championing the common man.  As he ages, he becomes less and less attuned to the common man, withdrawing to a gigantic manor named Xanadu, where he dies with only his servants and utters his final word: \\"Rosebud.\\"  The movie starts at Kane's death, and the making of a newsreel of his life.  A reporter sets off to discover the \\"secret\\" of the man, and to try to find the meaning of his final word.  Thus, the film is set up as a series of flashbacks as old friends and associates reminisce to the reporter about Kane.<br />Such a dry interpretation of the plot does not do justice to the magic, the humour, and the intricacies of the film.  It is superbly crafted and the performances are top-notch.  The screenplay is witty and the film is watchable over and over because the non-linear nature of the plot keeps you guessing about what will come up next (a credit to editor Robert Wise).<br />This DVD edition is clean and crisp.  The video is fantastic (perhaps too good - the newsreel, famously dragged around the parking lot by Wise to make it look more realistic, is perhaps too clean).  The sound is okay (but not great).  There are numerous special features.  Some are not very useful, such as layouts of storyboards that are too small (on my system) to see.  Two extras stand out.  The first is the 2-hour documentary on Wells, the movie, and William Randolf Hearst, the alleged basis for the character of Kane.  Instead of focussing on the film and the similarities and differences between Hearst and Kane, it actually compares the lives and careers of Hearst and Wells, only relating to the film character when there is an obvious overlap (e.g., the relationship between Kane/Hearst and their respective mistress-starlets).  The second great extra is the audio commentary by Roger Ebert.  He gives an inside view (culled from books, documentaries, and his own observations) of all aspects of the film, including shot composition, special effects, the actors and crew, etc.  It's a fascinating accompaniment (much better than the trite and dull second commentary by Peter Bogdanovich).<br />Therefore, this DVD is well worth the price for any fan of Citizen Kane.  Or, in fact, any fan of good cinema.

B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go. This is what you do when you listen to Canadian newcomer, Avril Lavigne's debut album, appropriately titled, &quot;Let Go&quot;.  This amazingly talented 17 year old singer/songwriter takes you on a journey inside her mind. From start to finish, she leaves you wanting more, or at least listening to it over and over again. The incredibly gripping, and might i add, ROCKIN' first track, &quot;Losing Grip&quot; is definitely one of her most intense and powerful songs on this record! There is much diversity on this album that is evident of the variety of music Avril, herself is influence by. From the punk - &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, to the rock - &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, and &quot;Unwanted&quot;, to the pop - &quot;My World&quot; , &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot;, to the beautifully crafted mellow tracks - &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot;, and &quot;Naked&quot;, and to the just plain fun to listen and sing-a-long to tracks (which could easily be all of them) - &quot;Mobile&quot;, &quot;Things I&quot;ll Never Say&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;, and of course, the ever so popular first single, &quot;Complicated&quot;. It's all about life, love, relationships, and the freedom of just being yourself, but all through the eyes of one incredibly gifted girl. If you're looking for pure, raw talent and amazingly honest music, check out Avril Lavigne and her debut record, LET GO. It would be difficult for you to be disappointed...
B00000G6AF|5.0|This import defines an entire genre of electronic music. It's not the generic thumping beats of house/dance, it's got clever beats and breaks, catchy rhythms that have me drumming on the steering wheel, and no annoying vocals to speak of (y'know, the operatic woman repeating the same thing over and over)<BR>Their original use of real instruments like organs, flutes, all kindsa drums, is now often immitated, and that's great, but this is the album that started it all.<BR>These songs are excellent for exciting background music for video games (pefect for games that let you use your own music) and for driving and general grooving.<BR>I don't normally review, but this is my favorite discovery EVER.
B00005V9HH|5.0|\\"The Usual Suspects\\" is such a phenomenal story, with a great ensemble cast - what could be better than owning it on DVD? Well I'll tell you - owning the special edition on DVD. The special features on here are probably equal to the length of the movie itself, and offer really great insight into the director, editor, and cast. Extensive interviews with the key players reveal inside information that is fascinating. The gag reel is hysterical, and the bit of Del Torro \\"getting stuck on words\\" as Fenster alone is worth the price of the entire disc. The deleted scenes aren't as interesting as I'd hoped - I think the crew did a great job selecting what got left out.<br />The plot is wonderful, involving a small crew of big- and small-time criminals and con-men who must work together to repay their individual debts to a mysterious man named Keyser Soze. Soze is a legend (some even say a myth,) whom many people believe to be the devil himself. He is ruthless, brutal, powerful and hugely successful. Pete Postlethewaite plays a wonderful attache for Mr. Soze, carrying off a bizarre combination of careful politeness edged by steely resolve. There aren't enough accolades for this whole cast, though - each actor does an incredible job of getting into his character's skin, and each man makes the viewer believe that he feels each and every little tic and itch his character would feel.<br />The first time I saw this film, I confess that I was had - I honestly didn't know how it would end until The Big Reveal. I suspect it'll keep most people guessing. Even then, after knowing how it ends, watching it over and over again is still enjoyable, simply because of the details and hints to the truth one picks up. Plus, the characters are so engaging, and the chemistry between all of them works so well, it's just a supremely enjoyable ride every time. After having watched it perhaps 10 times, it's still something I pull out now and then.
B00004THAY|5.0|Well folks, what can you say?. When you get a CD like this with two of the biggest guitar legends that ever lived, you know it's going to be something special. You slip that disc in and the first few chords of the opening track, which is the magnificent title track, \\"Riding With The King\\", gives you goosebumps and you just instantly get a smile on your face and know that you are in for a great, jammin' experience. According to Eric Clapton, this has been a project long in the making. A dream come true. That dream has come true for the rest of us. The title track, which was written by that other guitar master John Hiatt back in 1983, is a glorious opener for the CD. perfect. It sets the mood for the listener and doesn't hold back. You are then swept into a journey that'll take you thru R&B, blues, and good old fashioned rock and roll. Clapton's voice and B.B.'s voice blend perfectly together. It just works. A number of songs on here are old B.B. songs. Why not?. There are the bluesy songs like \\"Ten Long Years\\", \\"Three 'O' Clock Blues\\", and the great \\"When My Heart Beats Like A Hammer\\". One of the best tracks, and another B.B. great, is the up-tempo foot stomper \\"Days Of Old\\". A real big stand out. The other tracks here fare just as well. The rock of \\"Marry You\\" is funky and catchy, while \\"I Wanna Be\\" is another fun, up-tempo toe tapper. \\"Help The Poor\\" is a pleasing guitar ditty. The closing track, \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\", is a teriffic and sweet finale. I have, however, saved my favorite moment from this CD for last. It was a song co-written by Isaac Hayes, recorded by Sam And Dave in 1966, and charted at #21 on the charts. I'm talking about \\"Hold On I'm Coming\\". What a great shining light on an already glowing CD. The original is a monumental classic, but it takes on a whole new life here with these two doing it. It's like you are hearing it and falling in love with it for the first time. Pitch perfect. Then again, you can say the same for the CD. Clapton and King's voices are as good as they could ever possibly be. The guitar playing is what playing guitar is all about. These two are the masters. Everyone else can learn everything from them. If after listening to this CD doesn't get you to want to play the guitar, I seriously don't know what will. It's hard to believe that B.B. is 77 years old now. 75 when he did this CD. Clapton is 4 years away from turning 60. You hate to see your heroes age, but it hasn't slowed B.B. down any!.... This CD is the best. You couldn't ask for anything better. Get it. Get it now. You won't be sorry.
B000065U1N|3.0|The DVD had poor picture, sound, characters, and acting(e.g. Capt. Steele)  The movie did not get involved with the characters so when they got shot you said, who is that. The special features were below par for such a large movie.  The ones that were there were not thorough or thought through.  Get this movie when the special edition comes out.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie looks like a generic, teen-dating movie but it's not.  I love this film because whoever made obviously realized that teenagers really think!  Basing the plot on a Shakespeare story makes it slightly more intellectual than most teen-oriented films and the dialogue challenges your thoughts more,  not to mention it's hilarious!!  Not to be missed.
0788811355|5.0|I'm not really sure why this movie's being panned as severely as it is.  Maybe the dense plot put off those looking for an action epic.  Maybe the passionate but ultimately destructive relationship put off those looking for a formulaic happy-ending fluff romance.  Maybe these people just don't like thinking during movies, because this movie doesn't lay everything out for you and you have to work to figure out character motivations, plot, symbolism, etc.  But to me, all those things that this movie isn't only adds to its richness and beauty.<br />The story is told half in flashbacks, half in present tense, with the beginning a sort of bridge between the two: Story A, Juliette Binoche's nurse caring for the mysterious English Patient, begins at the end of Story B, where Ralph Fiennes (on an expedition in the desert) falls madly in love with a married woman (Thomas).  Later, Story C also interweaves with A and B, telling of Willem Dafoe's bitter thief and his connection with the English Patient.  This storytelling device is probably what makes the movie brilliant (although the acting, romance and cinematography are hardly to be treated lightly).  <br />Despite technical brilliance, it is The English Patient's examination of emotions that gives it its heart; the sheer passion of the movie makes me cry every time I see it.  And the characters are fascinating, much like Anthony Minghella's later work, The Talented Mr Ripley.  No one here can be called a caricature, with the possible exception of Katherine; while you may not understand everything they do, part of the fun is piecing together their actions into complex individuals.<br />You should be warned that you do see a bit more of both Thomas and Binoche than you perhaps would like to, and Almasy and Katherine DO engage in adultery, but if you can overcome any objections to either of those issues and keep your mind open, you may be as moved as I was.  The English Patient is a heart-breaking, passionate, powerful, dense, confusing, mesmerizing, extraordinary, and simply beautiful movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think think this album is awesome because Avril is awesome. Right now I'm trying 2 learn how 2 play the guitar and her music has been a real inspiration. Thanks alot.

Well, basically she rox and she has the best album EVER!! If you haven't got it yet u need 2 and if u don't want it your missing out!! Thanks alot!! Peace!! L8er
B000031WD9|1.0|Having to give this movie one star is one think I dont like about this store, whatever it's called. This borderline-porno, excessively obscene and ridiculous junk is a real bad influence on kids. Eugene Levy lost the respect I had for him in his 'Armed and Dangerous' days (1986) and the late night comedy series putting him along side John Candy. Please, leave the sex, nudity, graphic and pervasive language and obscene sexually suggestive behaviour and topics to adults. I cant believe producers and directors are letting these kids between the ages of 7 and 20 get up in front of a camera and behave like this. This is the kind of garbage that influences kids to emmulate these characters and in the end winds up on the 'O'Reily Factor'. Parents, dont let your kids get their hands on this. Trends USED to be OK to follow but this is pushing way over the limit, Ive never reviewed a movie here that I didnt like, but this has no place in any home. And while some of you reading this might be ready to trash this review saying..\\"Hey man, thats wacked\\" or whatever \\"That movie is awesome\\"... Let me tell you something, Im in my mid 20s' and I still disaprove of this trash. I live, I work, I most importantly dont do THIS all day but this kind of mistake by movie-makers is what causes these rebelious, vulgar, disrespectful and mindless characters to jump off the screen and into the homes of it's adolescent audience. If you want a good movie for your kids that'll appeal to them try 'The Breakfast Club' (1984) or something newer like 'Can't Hardly Wait' (1998).
B0000399WI|5.0|This is one of favorite movies, and for good reason.  It is one of those movies that you're not so sure about until you see the very end, then everything falls into place in your mind, and it is a great movie.  Outstanding performances by Robbins and Freeman help mold the movie into what it is.  <br />It isn't a typical prison movie, as someone said.  It isn't a prison that has a story to tell, it's a story being told about a prison and what it holds and is capable of, yet, the story revolves around two men, best friends, Robbins and Freeman.<br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is willing to sit and watch the lengthy, well-told story of two men, the prison that holds them, and the spectacular ending.

B000060P79|5.0|For those of you who have been looking for a new punk band... Simple Plan is great. They have really good sound and awesome lyrics that you can totally relate to! Another thing that's good about them is that every song is different... so you won't get tired of the cd. Great investment, and even if punk isn't quite your style, I encourage you to try it out- they have sooo much talent and I guarantee you'll like them!

B00005QXDD|5.0|This CD is pure comic gold.  My first introduction to The D was F**k Her Gently... I was hooked.  I quickly burned the CD off my mate and lo and behold I was introduced to The D That Is Tenacious.  <br />As all the other reviewers have said, this combines laugh-out-loud crass humour with some awesome riffs.  The music is seriously good!  At first the comic skits are what attracts you, but after a while you'll realise the songs, the music and the lyrics are what makes this CD so damn catchy!!!  My personal faves are 'Explosivo', 'Tribute' and 'City Hall'.  But [heck], there aint a bad track on the CD.  Tenacious D truly will rock your socks off!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Listening to Avril Lavigne's CD &quot;Let Go&quot; makes me want to start a band. Her inspirational songs remind me that I don't have to be like everyone to be accepted. Avril is a  true inspiration leader and this CD proves that even someone so young can have amazing amounts of talent! Avril this album is the best thing that could possibly happen to me! You inspire me!

B00005B3Z6|5.0|The British QAF is far superior to the American version.  The characters are more developed despite its shorter length compared to the Showtime version.  The acting is definitely way better.  If you have a hard time understanding the thick Manchester accent, turn the subtitles on.  The bottom line is that this version kicks arse

B000056NX5|5.0|As many of those who've reviewed this presentation of the classic, I grew up with my parents owning the two album set of the London recording. Whenever I'm reading the lyrics (or listening to whichever version of the albums I happen to hear), it's the original words and beat I keep to. Much to the consternation of those around me, especially if the two are different (as one web-page noted, they are ALL different, a little!). I have to say, I have NEVER SEEN ANY OTHER VIDEO PRODUCTION of this ... event. So I cannot compare it to any of the older productions, except for the music.<br />The Music is ... the music. It's bright, sad, driving and wallowing in its own miseries, pulling you into the emotions with the singers.<br />However, having heard rumors of other productions (a tank in the desert?), I wasn't terribly expecting this to be Charleton Heston's The Bible quality. When I saw the costuming, I knew I was right - This isn't what my parents loved. It's newer, hotter, more ... today.<br />Each version has it's place, I think. Bring someone in who's never heard the music or seen any of the productions. They'll be able to stay awake with this one. Gradually, you can work them towards the more &quot;historical&quot; adaptations.<br />But, my favorite &quot;bit&quot; in this movie has GOT to be when Judas was sitting on the Cross Jesus was trying to carry, mockingly holding out one of the &quot;mini-bibles&quot; made by the Gideons. I about died laughing. Cruel? Mocking? Sure. Why not. From what I've heard of the other productions, we've gone from the dead-pan historically accurate to the odd ...<br />Because, no matter WHO sings them, the songs are JUST THAT GOOD.
B000002B7S|3.0|Ozzy is kind of a paradox in heavy metal music. His image, his reputation, and the mystique surrounding him have always been undeniably in line with many of the more macabre metal stars of the 70's and 80's (Dio, Maiden, Priest, Alice Cooper), but his music itself has always had more pop content than anyone would probably like to admit. Even some of his more well-regarded songs like &quot;Flying High Again&quot;, &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; and &quot;Mama, I'm Coming Home&quot; seem to have been designed for Top 40 status (and in the case of &quot;Mama&quot;, actually was his first and only Top 40 solo hit). &quot;Bark At The Moon&quot; and it's successor &quot;The Ultimate Sin&quot; both mined Ozzy's poppier side more blatantly than ever before or since. In the case of BATM, the result is a good conventional hard rock album in the same vein as 80's-era Aerosmith or Kiss, but way too awash in synths and pop metal hooks to really garner him any real respect. This is probably due to the fact that guitarist Jake E. Lee was not as proficient or unique in his style as either his predecessor (Rhandy Rhoads) or successor (Zaak Wylde) and thus they had to step up the keyboards to give the songs some character. The title track is the obvious centerpiece, and songs like &quot;You're No Different&quot; , &quot;Now You See It (Now You Don't)&quot;, and &quot;Centre of Eternity&quot; all contain enough of that trademark ominous sound to merit respectability, despite the omnipresent keyboards. However, the ballad &quot;So Tired&quot; and the flat-out pop metal &quot;Slow Down&quot; surely drove away the Ozzman's fans like lemmings running toward the edge of the cliff. A good album for completists and fans of the song &quot;Bark At The Moon&quot;, but hardly an essential Ozzy album. For that, turn to &quot;Blizzard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, and &quot;No More Tears&quot;.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie left me with more than a question mark shinning over my head. It left me in awe.<br />The filming style is gorgeous, the story is fantastic and in the end you're left feeling like a surfer who's just been plowed over by an enormous wave. This movie takes you on a trip you won't soon forget. It's blends the world of reality with the world of possibilty through the eyes of a dark, eeire teenager. The bunny is one of the coolest characters i've seen in film. N.B. the scene where Donnie is stabbing the eye of Frank (the bunny) with a butcher knife. It left me with my body hair standing on end. Great flim.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Excellent comprehensive review of one of the most classic of classic rock bands, but of course even a two-disc retrospective isn't enough to hold the best of a group that regularly turn in 10-minute-plus masterpieces. And it seems like most everything they've done that clocks in at over 10 minutes made the final roster for &quot;Echoes&quot;. Most of the band's more harder-rocking tracks (&quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, &quot;Have A Cigar&quot;) were left aside for some of the more etheral, stoner-friendly material, which is a shame. I mean, how many people really know &quot;The Fletcher Memorial Home&quot; and don't know &quot;Young Lust&quot;? Anyway, here's the tracks that Disc THREE should have had (sorry, no Syd Barrett era stuff for me) - Have A Cigar, Goodbye Blue Sky, The Dogs Of War, Welcome To The Machine, Pigs (Three Different Ones), Lost For Words, One Slip, Mother, Not Now John, What Do You Want From Me, On The Turning Away, Empty Spaces/Young Lust, Take It Back, Run Like Hell, Brain Damage/Eclipse.
B0000062GK|2.0|When his self-titled album was released I was initially diappointed, but soon found it to be the richest, most soulful of his releases. So this album turned out to be a real let-down. Instead of continuing to break new ground, it seems like Satch is just trying to make another Surfing with the Alien. Many of the songs follow a Surfing-type formula, with obligatory modal shifts and power-chord intros. There's little evidence of any new ground being explored. He's never been good at song titles and this features some of the worst. Still, if you hated the self-titled album, you'll probably enjoy this tired rehash of his old stuff.
0312265859|5.0|I just finished this, and I feel like I need to read it again just to take it all in.  All of the usual Stephanie Plum stuff is here (destroyed cars, crazy FTAs, the family, Bob, etc.), and there are some great, laugh-out-loud moments.  But this book has an almost totally different vibe than the rest of the books.  The Amazon.com review stated that there was an edge of darkness to this book, and I think they understated it.  All of a sudden the Morelli v. Ranger story has become very serious (btw, this book is GREAT for Ranger Babes), and the villian this time makes Stephanie's past adversaries look like a walk in the park.  There's no cliffhanger (thank goodness), but the ending was as shocking as they come.  I'm still trying to figure out how I feel about it.<br />All in all, I think this is the best of the Plum books, so far.  While the others are a great, fluffy read, this installment starts giving the characters more dimension, and that's to the good.  Just don't buy this book expecting it to be completely true to formula.
B00001U0DP|1.0|I just don't understand why lots of people like this movie. I decided to rent this movie after being persuaded by my persistent colleague who keeps saying that this is the best movie ever made. After watching the movie, I disagree. Why would anyone love this movie, I don't understand. But what I do understand this movie is ridiculous. It tries very hard to show that a father would do anything to save his son from the horror of war. But it's nothing but stupid illusion. You may be able to lie for a day or two, but not every day. Fatherly love is fine for me, but it is so overdone that, while watching the movie, I started to think that Benigni was trying to show that his son (Bartolomeo?) is so naive (stupid?) that he would not understand what really was happening around him. And how could Guido control those around him? Simply impossible.<br />I give one out of five.
B00005CDUE|4.0|Compiling a one CD \\"Best of Roxy Music\\" is a tough task. Why?... well, not only did the group re-invent itself in personnel &amp; style on at least three occasions during its 10 year life but, the strength of its most effective albums (in particular \\"For Your Pleasure\\", \\"Country Life\\", \\"Flesh + Blood\\" and \\"Avalon\\") lies in their cohesion, making the selection of individual tracks out of context extremely difficult. So... better to forget any pretensions to a \\"Best of...\\" title and to consider this compilation for what it actually is: an intriguing and successful retrospective.<br />Intriguing because it's sequenced \\"back to front\\", starting off with the \\"radio friendly\\", beautifully crafted tracks produced at the end of their career and then progressing backwards (in time at least!) to the distinctly less \\"easy listening\\" and far more radical outings from the beginning of their career. Compare this album's first track (\\"Avalon\\", from their last studio recording) to its last track (\\"Re-Make/Re-Model\\", from their first record) to witness the scale of the change involved. Successful, because it gradually  takes the listener from the familiar to the \\"strange\\" and, in so doing, pretty effectively maps out the group's career while providing, on the way, an excellent \\"sampler\\" of what's to be found on their individual albums. A job well done but, \\"The Best of...\\": unlikely/impossible!
B00005QCVY|5.0|This film is my all-time favorite film of all time. There is no movie I enjoy watching more over and over.<br />James Stweart and Donna reed take you on a real emotional journey throughout the ideals of one man who belives he never made a difference to anyone. And the kick is, an angel is motived to help George Bailey because if he is successful in making George relaize his value - he gets his wings.<br />There's romanace, teen courting, adventure, passiona dn a lot of magic. Even George's mother is the mother everyone wishes they had. There is alos a mean, villinous, evil banker - named Mr. Potter, who ruins everything. (He actually never gets his cum-upance - one of the only problems I ever had with the film.)<br />The DVD is spectacular. The docudrama on the making of the film and Frnak Capra and his life is very interesting. There's the original trailers, behind the scenes, models and sets. Really a great DVD. (Also has some bloopers as well!)<br />Although it is shown to death around the Christmas Holidays - you should still take one night and watch it without interuption with your entire family. Buy it!

B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is a refreshing new singer to a tired musical scene, not may artist out there today can with one song sweep me friends and I off our feet.

It is a definite &quot;must have&quot; and I recomend full heartily that you buy this CD today!
B00006690F|5.0|The Eminem Show is by far one of the best CD's I have ever bought.  The lyrics to each and every song speak a lot of truth.  The only reason people hate on him is because they see the truth in what he says and they just do not want to admit it.  The beats are awesome and you won't even wanna skip one song on this CD.  My favorite tracks are Cleaning Out My Closet and Superman.  Also, My Dad's Gone Crazy featuring Hailie is really good too.  JUST BUY THE EMINEM SHOW!!!!!
0684833395|5.0|At first I thought this book ridiculous.  No one is as whacked as these characters.  Then I started to recognize my own flaws.  I saw that the ridiculous characters have the same flaws we all have, only exaggerated in the book.  The Chief believes he will die of pneumonia so he does not bother to wear a coat.  Of course he gets sick and dies of pneumonia.  How many times have we lost before we started because we thought we could never win?  We defeat ourselves as the Chief did.  I saw myself in other characters too.  Heller shows us our own tragic flaws through a cast of ridiculous, but quite realistic characters.  Everyone should read this book.  It is funny, sad, ridiculous and brilliant.

B00005QIPH|4.0|To say that The Strokes are the second coming of rock is a drastic overstatement. However, \\"Is This It\\" is certainly a breath of fresh air in the pop market.<br />\\"Is This It\\" is not earth-shattering in any way, nor is it incredibly revolutionary or thought-provoking. But, unlike many acts today, The Strokes provide easy, fun rock. This record isn't ambitious, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.<br />The title track sets the pace for the entire album--a rolling, simple drum beat, an easy as pie (and just as enjoyable) guitar riff, and a dancing, almost goofy bass line. Top that off with a lead singer who sounds like he's on the phone because he was too lazy to come to practice, and you have The Strokes.<br />You won't find the meaning of life in this album. You will, however, enjoy yourself.  All I can say is that The Strokes have \\"it.\\"  What more do you need?
B000002LIR|5.0|This compliation of Rod Stewarts work is the best that there is.  I read another person's review of it and they didn't like songs on there from the 80's like, \\"Love Touch\\" and \\"Infatuation\\".  Well my friend, those songs happen to be icon songs of the 80's.  If you don't like \\"Pop Rock\\", then I suggest you listen to something stupid from the 60's.  Rod's best work was done in the 80's and my two favorites of his happen to be \\"Love Touch\\" and \\"Infatuation\\"  they epitimize the use of synthesizers and guitars riffs to the extreme.  So if you have just started your Rod Stewart collection, this is the cd compliation to purchase.  After about 1990, Rod's music went to the sewer with his 90's trendy unplugged versions...  So if you love 70's and 80's Rod, then buy this, its awesome and in Rod's own words, it will keep you \\"Forever Young\\".
B000065U1N|4.0|I have just finished reading some of the reviews for BHD.  Many are typical, some are insightful and a few are laughable.  Here's my take on the movie:<br />As an Army officer, this movie hits VERY close to home.  It reminded me of the sacrifices that many of my comrades have made in the past and the sacrifices that may be asked of us soldiers in the future. For those who say that this movie was unrealistic, I think you should really think twice about that opinion.  I have served with many folks who were ACTUALLY THERE and they tell me it is pretty dead on.  A few even said that they were hesitant to see it because it was so realistic.  Remember that those events really happened and the the majority of the names were not changed.  Those men really did die and they really did do those things you saw.  Probably most disturbing for me was imagining family members of the fallen watching this movie and seeing how their sons or husbands died (this is especailly true for PFC Jamie Smith, the soldier who bled to death before our very eyes).<br />War is hell folks, there is no way to gloss over that.  I think Ridley Scott chose to portray the carnage, the chaos and confusion of combat.  He did an outstanding job.  It is a true anti-war film, in that it shows you what really happens.  My only real complaint is that we didn't get very much background on the characters and he didn't try to distinguish them on the screen.  It does make it a bit confusing.  But again, I don't think Scott's aim was to tell a certain character's story, but give us the overall picture.<br />As for all of the political hub-bub that has been posted here, people get over it.  Whatever your political stance, you cannot deny that fact that these men acted heroicially.  They died for each other, not some political agenda.  No amount of politiclal spin will change that.  When the bullets are flying, politics are the last thing a soldier is thinking about.  Racism?  I doubt it.  Yes there are mostly white folks in the movie, but remember, most of the Rangers and Delta operators WERE white (conversely, most Africans are black).  What of it?  Our initial mission was to SAVE Africans.  The men we killed were thugs and criminals.  That they were black was inconsiquential (BTW, before you start slamming me as a white bigot, I'm an asin-american and quite experienced at being on the receiving end of racism).  And not all the Somalis were portrayed as evil (altough many were not angels).  They WERE the enemy however, and were portrayed as such.<br />In conclusion, this was a very good movie.  It wasn't a perfect film, but very good nontheless.  It achieved what it was aiming for: telling the soldier's story and to pay tribute to those who died.  This movie is NOT for the faint of heart or the squeemish.  But it is for those who want to know what our military members endure for the sake of their country.
B000060P79|5.0|After hearing &quot;Im Just a Kid&quot; I had to run out and buy this cd because they are awesome. You should definitly go out and buy this rock'n cd! Because if you dont you dont know what your missing. There music is different then most bands and i like it that way.
038533558X|5.0|Wow!!!!  I just finished this fabulous book and I'm trying to catch my breath.  I was crying and laughing and shaking my head with each chapter. This is one fabulous suspense novel.
B00005QIPH|2.0|I was planning to write about my disappointment with this album, when measured against the hype and the column inches lavished on this band. But Alex Cox on June 6th appears to have got there first and said it better.<br />Underproduced, undertuned, overly-derivative. I only gave it two stars rather than one, because - despite the disillusionment - there are a couple of songs that almost make worthwhile listening, and after all they're not N' Sync...
B000066NW0|5.0|This is one of the BEST albums i have bought this year!! I can listen through the whole CD without skipping a song. Avril has a huge career ahead of her! And if this CD's good I can't imagine how her next will be. Go Avril!!
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne sings great and her songs are catchy and positive. There is only one problem, she puts out this image of being a total punk/skater chick who isn't going to change herself to get you to like her, but her music is pop.It sounds like Britney Spears learned how to play guitar from sum 41 and got vocal lessons from alainis morriset. She might write it well, and play a guitar, but isn't what she is said to be, If her true style is pop then don't put the image out of being punk. Let Go is still a good CD if you like pop. if you like punk don't be fooled.

0812505085|3.0|I think most people have a pre-conceived notion about this book and its characters, but I read it for the first time recently and found that most of what I thought about it was wrong; the book and characters were both better than I had anticipated.    <br />The characters in this book are well developed and well written.  Stevenson's use of dialogue is what really sets this book apart; you can tell from their dialect exactly what type of person each of the characters is and which group they fit into.  <br />The most interesting character isn't the narrator, but Long John Silver, the evil pirate.  Silver is eminently adaptable and manages to charm everyone he comes into contact with by telling them what they want to hear; he reminds me of many of today's politicians.  <br />Overall, this is definately worth the read.
B00003Q438|3.0|The Abyss is James Cameron's weakest film.  However, Cameron should be proud that even his weakest film has plenty of merits, and its attempt at pulling off a global message is noble, even if it's a noble failure.<br />This was one case where the &quot;director's cut&quot; phenomenon really proves unappetizing for the viewer.  There's a reason why the theatrical release version of this film was nearly a half hour shorter than this &quot;special edition&quot;, which is that the extra footage simply bogs down the momentum of the film, already quite languid to begin with.  The booklet to this DVD edition offers up an invaluable resource by describing exactly what differences exist from scene to scene between the special edition and the theatrical release, but nearly all of the arguments it offers for restoring the &quot;director's cut&quot; are unfounded.  Much of the restored footage is painstaking background detail and reiterations of concepts that already exist in the theatrical cut, and the badly written &quot;two candles&quot; scene features possibly the worst acting from Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio in the film.<br />That said, even given the slow pacing, it's a tribute to Cameron's writing and directing abilities that the narrative thrust remains and you'd probably still be engaged throughout those long underwater-exploration scenes.  Michael Biehn, playing against type, does an excellent job portraying the detestable yet human Coffey; he makes life hell for everybody around him, yet Biehn and Cameron smartly instill the character with pathos.  Ed Harris is never less than compelling, and his unique, intimate charm carries the film.  Mastrantonio is the weak link in the cast -- she gets the hotheadedness and toughness of the character, but when trying to project the more vulnerable moments, her overacting grates on the nerves.  The photography and special effects are gorgeous (making it easy to see why it'd be tempting to restore the cut footage), and Alan Silvestri's score is fitting and elegant.  The central message is extremely preachy, but I still have to give it to Cameron for having attempted to convey it at all.  Few films and filmmakers have the daring to make such global, universal statements, and though Cameron was not able to seamlessly incorporate the message into the narrative of The Abyss, his attempt is admirable.  He would succeed in spades come time of Terminator 2:  Judgment Day.<br />A flawed film, one which still warrants a serious look.
B00003XAQ5|5.0|You'd better be kidding if you say you dislike this one. It's probably the most revolutionary album in modern jazz, and probably always will be. On this 1959 classic, Miles Davis in association with pianist Bill Evans, introduces a new way of improvising, a new way of thinking, and this album make it possible for people to find a new way of listening.<br />They started to base whole tunes on vamps with very few chords. \\"So What\\" is of course the main \\"theme\\" on this album, and it had a form like no other song by then. Today it's referred to as \\"modal jazz,\\" and all kinds of styles have borrowed this idea since. Here there are only two chords: D-7 for 16 bars, the Eb-7 for 8 bars, and then 8 bars of D-7 again. No one had done such a thing in jazz before (but Coltrane later recorded an up-tempo piece with a different melody to this very form, called \\"Impressions\\"...also worth looking into).<br />\\"Freddie Freeloader\\" is played basically over a blues form; the melody is played for 24 bars, and what makes this blues different from a normal rock-progression-blues is bar no.11&12. Listen...<br />Then there is the soft ballad \\"Blue In Green\\", which, again has an odd form considering the music style and year of recording. There are 10 bars that repeat throughout the whole thing with a theoretically-not-so-logical-but-very-beutiful-chord-progression. It's kind of hard keeping track where the form starts over again, but it doesn't matter when you're listening to musicians like these.<br />\\"All Blues\\"...another classic (well, they all are), but this blues is played in 3/4, which had not been done a lot in jazz either. Charles Mingus did it in 1959 (the song \\"Better git it in your soul\\"), but I don't know if it was Miles or Mingus who first recorded a 3/4-blues. Anyway, the sessions were only a couple of weeks apart, and recorded in the same studio!<br />\\"Flamenco Sketches\\"...a very nice, smooth piece, but rarely played as a cover by other musicians (unlike all other selections)...maybe because it's hard to find it as sheet music, I don't know, and I don't understand why it's never gotten as much attention as the rest of the songs, because it suites with the feeling of all the other tracks.<br />On this album plays (one of my favorite sax-players of all time) John Coltrane, who in 1959, had not YET developed anything revolutionary on his instrument, but still played cool solos;<br />Cannonball Adderley on alto, who has very different thinking in solo-playing than the rest of these men. He's got long lines with a lot of variation in these solos;<br />Paul Chambers plays bass on the whole record. Listen to the walking bass-line on the first 16 bars of Miles' solo on \\"So What\\". Chambers plays a repeated figure with a little variation, making it sound like a separate melody underneath Miles' solo - quite unusual in walking-bass by this time. I could analyse his bass playing on this record until I've used up the maximum of 1000 words, do I don't think I'll get into more on him. To me, Chambers, Mingus, Carter, and Jaco are gods; this is also the first time, I believe, that Bill Evans performed on a Miles Davis album. He was not a very famous piano player at the time, unlike now, much thanks to his piano playing on this album. Evans is replaced by Wynton Kelly on \\"Freddie Freeloader\\" and Jimmy Cobb plays drums throughout. And Miles himself, a genius in modern jazz with a very personal approach to everything he plays...don't know where to start...just listen. Get yourself at least one copy of this album. This is probably where to start if you're new to the artist (unless you feel a need for chronology...but in that case you'd better have a big pile of green if you want to get to this album anytime soon.

B000056K04|4.0|I don't know what everyone else is talking about, but I thought \\"Everyday\\" was pretty good.  Especially considering that I have no standard to judge it by.  It's the only DMB album I have.  There's not one bad song on here, not to mention that Dave Matthews has one of the most original voices in rock & roll today.  Even though people are complaining that the violinist and the saxophonist got pushed into the background, I don't really care.  If it's catchy, that's all that matters to me.  C'mon... who didn't like \\"I Did It\\", \\"The Space Between\\", or \\"Everyday\\"?
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's cd &quot;Let Go&quot; is a great inspiring cd. The lyrics show feeling and are based on real life situations. The sound of her voice and the background music captures you! All of the songs are great. Sk8er Boi has a really good story line behind it. The cd is also enhanced and there are good videos on it. Avril is a great musician!!
0385335482|5.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic is fun, fun, fun--a lighthearted fairy tale about women who shop too much.  I think most women will see at least a trace (and some much more than a trace) of themselves in Becky.  She shops like crazy and rationalizes every overpriced purchase.  Who hasn't bought something on sale thinking that they were actually saving money.  (Unfortunately, when you read about Becky doing so, you'll see your logical lapse).  Becky is a charming heroine, and Confessions of a Shopaholic is a fun and very funny read.  There is not a speck of depth in the novel, so if you're looking for that, look elsewhere.  This, like most romantic comedies of it's kind, is a just an enjoyable, engaging light read.  Enjoy.

0446677450|1.0|This book is nonsense.  The \\"tone\\" of the writing is condescending and repetitive. It's like reading a motivational speech at one of those money-making scam seminars.  As others have mentioned, the author's veracity is in question regarding the facts of his life. I do not believe there is a \\"Rich Dad\\", personally. I don't think we should line the pockets of this guy. I STRONGLY urge you to do a search on the author's name on Google or any good search engine, and maybe add in the modifier \\"criticism\\" or \\"MLM\\".  If I could save just one person from wasting their money on this book, I'll be pleased.    Oh, and telling people not to bother with an education?  Pinhead advice.
B000066NW0|5.0|The first time I saw Avril Lavigne's video and heard the song was when i just happened to turn on the tv and there she was. My first impression was WOAH who's this?? I saw the whole video and heard the song and was sooo impressed! I thought she was like 15 years old. She has talent, great looks (she's sooo PRETTY!!), and like an awesome voice!!! Also, a great band to go along with it all! I bought the CD the first day it came out and I listened to the whole CD non-stop for like 2 hours! I was amazed!! I was soo happy about this new artist and her music that I went out and bought 10 more of her CDs to give to my friends. That resulted in myself getting grounded, but it was so worth it!! Her CD is the best I've heard since forever!! Keep up the great work, Avril!!
0805066691|5.0|It is axiomatic that history gets written by the winners - the losers are invariably made to look like bad men or natural losers or both. The point of \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" is to take a history that most of us know only from the winning perspective, and narrate it from the point of view of the losers.<br />Brown accomplishes this objective with considerable grace and beauty in spare, elegant narrative prose and verbatim quotes from key historical personages. Not a single word is wasted on description, sermonising or misguided attempts to explain the unexplainable. The mind-boggling amount of research Brown must have undertaken into state, federal and tribal records over the years is placed entirely at the service of the narrative. This story is broken up into episodes of just the right length and pace, each one revolving around a particular campaign or leader. The author never tries to manipulate the reader's emotions, but then he never has to.<br />Sadly, I think (with respect) that some readers and reviewers have missed the point of this sublime work. Of course it is not objective, and of course it is not the whole story. There are two sides to every conflict, and in the so-called \\"Indian Wars\\" there were rights and wrongs committed on both sides. But it is in our nature to be partisan, to want closure to a debate, to hold a clear judgement on the heroes and villains of the piece with no shades of grey to blur our moral certainties. The popular \\"Cowboys and Indians\\" culture of our parents' and grandparents' day was secure in its belief that civilised Christian values had won the day. The more politically sensitive consensus of our own day all too easily falls into the equal and opposite error of glorifying alternative cultures at the expense of our own.<br />If only real life worked in such simple black-and-white terms! To treat Brown's book as the definitive history of the West - especially as a school history text that at last sets the record straight and for the first time tells it like it was - would be (almost!) as misguided as basing your view of history on Hollywood blockbusters like the Cinerama epic, \\"How The West Was Won\\". The value of this book is quite different. It is an unashamedly subjective account of the sufferings endured by the First Americans at the hands of the European settlers and their government. It should be read in conjunction with the standard histories, and (in the mind's eye of the reader) juxtaposed on the images of White American legend.<br />Only thus, by embracing the tension between these different perspectives, can truth be served. Ultimately, Brown's book serves two valuable functions: Firstly, it provides a necessary antidote to the decades of triumphalist legend that depicted the Native Americans as little more than vindictive savages. But more than that, it gives America a record of what it lost through the destruction of such a rich and diverse cultural heritage. Given the simultaneous loss of innocence and the environmental damage that went hand in hand with the destruction, it is clear that the \\"winners\\" lost more than we have commonly grasped.ht and for the first time tells it like it was - would be (almost!) as misguided as basing your view of history on Hollywood blockbusters like the Cinerama epic, \\"How The West Was Won\\".

B00005YUNY|5.0|I am perhaps a bit biased, being a lifelong Yes fan.  However, it is a simple fact that this DVD is just about flawless in every respect.  The band turns in an excellent performance (how they manage to play material of this complexity, with essentially zero mistakes, all the while knowing that they can't blow it because they're being filmed, is beyond my understanding).  The video quality is superb (essentially as good as the &quot;House of Blues&quot; DVD, which was impeccable in its video quality), and the sound mix, especially the dts track, is extremely well done.  A previous reviewer stated that the band lacks energy -- I submit that the important thing is for the music to have energy, and that is certainly there in abundance.  Let's please remember that these guys are all in their 50's, and it is a blessing and a gift to all of us that they still have the creative drive to put out music of this quality after all these years.  The fact that they don't jump up and down on stage is, if anything, a refreshing change from the frenzy-heavy and talent-light drivel that seems to fill the airwaves these days.  These men are true virtuoso musicians, and they channel the energy where it belongs -- in their minds, in their arms and fingers, and in their creativity. <br />A paricularly positive aspect of this DVD is the presence of the orchestra.  Being a &quot;classic Yes&quot; fan, I had misgivings about the addition of an orchestra to what is, arguably, already very &quot;orchestral&quot; music in its own right.  I was wrong -- the orchestra added wonderfully to the sound, and detracted nothing from it.  Plus, it was comprised largely of young, enthusiastic players, who genuinely seemed to love the music and rightfully acted as if it was an honor to be there.  Plus, I LOVED the &quot;Roundabout&quot; encore, when the orchestra-girls (of which there were many, and quite nice-looking) stepped out onto the stage and proceeded to dance up a storm with the band -- you couldtell that Alan White loved this, and even the ever-serious Maestro Howe couldn't help but grin -- it was a memorable moment, and a powerful testament to the positiveness and the wonderful life-spirit of Yes music.  As to the rest of the concert, the personal highlight for me was &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; (played flawlessly) -- this is an extremely complex piece of music (aren't they all?), and the orchestra, especially in the percussion section, was very, very tight and locked in with the band -- fantastic job.<br />All in all, a must-have DVD for any Yes fan, and a perfect introduction to the band for any novice.  Buy this, folks, especially you younger ones that were raised on Grunge and Rap --this is the way rock music was written and played before it became a crime to play one's instrument well, and before it became unfashionable to actually have a positive outlook on life.
B000065U1N|5.0|This film is one of the best war films made, because of its ultra-realistic portrayal from the top-notch acting, as well as being historically accurate.  It also has a fantastic look to it, thanks to director Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, GI Jane, Gladiator) and the dynamic cinematography--this one needs to be seen in the widescreen format.  The sound is also amazing, and won Oscars because of it--you are truly immersed in the atmosphere.  This is a very violent film, but necessarily so, and the film pays a great service to of all the Americans who fought and were injured or killed in action, 2 of which earned the Medal of Honor--a very powerful and emotional movie.  Also a very timely movie with the war on terrorism, I think every American should see this film and be thankful for the soldiers who lay their lives on the line in the name of freedom.

B00005YU1O|5.0|I haven't yet bought this DVD, but very much plan on doing so.  I have always wondered, even to myself, the purpose for *buying* a movie.  Am I really going to watch it, over and over again?  There are plenty of DVD's I have bought, which I don't think I have watched since I bought them (this question, of course, becomes moot when dealing with a child's movie..since my four year old will watch Star Wars Episode One over and over..and he has relished in the menu aspect of being able to control the movie and its features... he is the new line of movie watchers: the interactive watcher).<br />One common feature that this DVD offers which has been used ad infinitum on most every DVD, but which I have finally found wonderfully useful on this DVD: the commentary.  It's neat knowing that the filmmakers have offered comments to run through a movie, but, except for American Beauty, I have not found the urge to use this feature.  This DVD offers a running text which gives you background on the philosophic ideas being presented, and even suggestions and excerpts from texts to consider if you want to explore a specific philosophy further.<br />A reviewer quoted here mentions how most of the audience walked out a third of the way through this movie when it was in the theater.I can understand that since, as a linear piece, it is quite taxing on attention span, despite the engrossing animation.  For a world conditioned to be distracted every ten minutes, it is quite a feat to sit through the movie, even for one such as I who feels he has quite a long span of attention.  This movie is ripe for DVD.  It is easy to pull out pieces to watch, stop, skip, return, repeat, in a way that even video tape could not afford.  In a way, this is a showpiece for the DVD format, which makes me wonder if other additional features could be created which were innovative to DVD... perhaps a randomizing feature which delinearized the film...hmmm.<br />Anyway, if you are a deep thinker and love a mind challenge, BUY it on DVD.  If your heroes are Jean Claude Van Damme, Stephen Segal, and Sylvester Stallone at his grunting best, you will be totally bored by this movie...go out and get the latest, blow-all-the-bad-guys'-guts-out Playstation game!!!hallenge, BUY it on DVD.

0385503954|5.0|I´ve read most of McEwan's novels, and Atonement is among the strongest.  <br />Unlike some of McEwan's work that starts out strong and then loses momentum (Enduring Love and The Child in Time stand out as examples) Atonement grows in weight and tension as the novel unfolds.  <br />The book's long and somewhat slow opening - a homecoming at the Tallis manor in the 1935 English countryside - sets the stage for all that follows and paints a picture full of McEwan's familiar threads: class in English society, love and jealousy.  The most important theme concerns the complex and ultimately terrible nature of a child's psyche - passionate and conflicted but unsophisticated due to lack of experience and therefore dangerous if given a moment to exercise its power.  The 13 year old Briony Tallis is precocious and self absorbed, but to a degree so are all children - the tragedy in this situation is that via a series of coincidences, blunders, and misunderstandings, an opportunity is created for Briony to wield her power over the adults around her.  This is a wrong which can never be undone and destroys the lives of two of the people closest to her.  <br />This opening section, heavily detailed and expertly staged, is in my opinion among the best that McEwan has written - all of the many details contribute to the scene's conclusion and build toward the rest of the novel.  From there the book changes gears considerably; we're taken through WWII both via the battlefield in France and hospitals in London, and ultimately back to the Tallis country manor in 1999. The pacing is brisk and eventful.<br />The London section work less well than those of the other sections, and some of the hospital scenes struck me as overly melodramatic while adding little to the plot and the development of the characters.  Overall, however, Atonement is a masterful piece of storytelling.  This is a better novel than McEwan's Booker Prize winning Amsterdam which preceded it.  Excellent.  Highly recommended.
B00000JGHM|4.0|Any fan of Michael Mann's films knows he is a master storyteller<br />who combines great cinematic visuals with strong characters. Without ever have seen one of his films, you can look at 30 seconds of a scene and see a signature style. &quot;Heat&quot; delivers on all levels. Great insight to the relentless pursuit of goals on both sides of the law. It's one of the first films I found myself rooting for both the good guy and the bad! I do disagree on one point that everyone seems to applaud. That two of Hollywood's best actors appear together in one movie. I challenge anyone to find me a scene in the movie where DeNiro and Pacino actually appear together. The restaurant? I see the back of a head when Pacino/Deniro are talking. The end? I still don't see the two of them together. Brilliant editing and great stand-ins, but I doubt these two were ever together on screen. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong. I recommend this movie highly to anyone who has not seen it. This is how movies should be done. A Brilliant Michael Mann Film!
B000066NW0|5.0|Let Go, and get ready for the ride.  <br />Avril Lavigne's debut album takes you on a journey through experiences that everyone can relate to.  Love, rejection, life, anger; the music is raw and real.  Her voice makes you feel the words, and these lyrics are something to listen to. Any listener can appreciate the words of these songs, which so accurately describe the unique experience of being young, growing up, and living life.  Avril Lavigne truly delivers the kind of experience that just takes you away.
B00001ZWTT|1.0|The worst movie before &quot;Battlefield Earth.&quot; It's truly awful.  Based on the 1960's TV show, the movie has nothing to do with the show. Will Smith plays James West, a secret agent man and Kevin Kline is his silly sidekick. The president who is also played by Kline, put the two men together to find a crazy Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branagh). Who cares!? This movie is so stupid, I thought it was &quot;Dumb &amp; Dumber 2.&quot; Pure poo in a bucket. Then take the bucket and put it over a doorway so one of these characters can open the door with a dropping surprise! Oh man, they even threw in Salma Hayek (who is usually good), but smelled everything up in this movie. Insanely disappointing mount of garbage that deserves to be tossed away.
B000066NW0|5.0|When I listened to this CD for the first time my first thought was Amazing.  I really enjoyed this CD and recommend it to anyone who enjoys good music.  Avril Lavigne is talented and real.  I admire her and her music because she actually writes and plays her own music.  There are songs on here that just make you want to rock out and others that are soothing and melodic.  The perfect combination for a smooth album.  For those of you who haven't heard it yet, go buy it and you'll agree that it was worth the [money] you have to shell out.
B00000F566|4.0|Every time we get to the end of \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" and Dr. Jake Houseman (Jerry Orbach) says \\"When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong,\\" I always end up yelling at the screen because he never says he is wrong!  \\"Dirty Dancing\\" has plenty of dancing, dirty and otherwise, but the juice for this film is supplied by the contrast between Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey.  He is Johnny Castle, basically a street punk earning a living dancing up a story at a Catskills resort.  She is Frances \\"Baby\\" Houseman, saved from being a cute little spoiled rich girl by her social conscience, and once the two of them collide \\"Baby\\" starts growing up real fast.  You see, Baby does Mombo and ends up having the time of her life.  Like John Travolta, Swayze proved that when you add some major hip swiveling to smoldering good lucks, it really, really works.  Grey personified sweet innocence and the resulting contrast made this campy little film work.  Interesting footnote: originally there were some nude scenes in this film but test audiences did not like seeing Baby naked, so they were cut.  Now, isn't that romantic?<br />Most Romantic Lines: (1) \\"Nobody puts Baby in a corner.\\"  (2) \\"I had...the time of my-y life...and I owe it all to yo-ou.\\" (Okay, nobody SAYS it, but it is the line you all remember.)<br />If you like \\"Dirty Dancing,\\" then check out these other films on AFI's list: #31 \\"The King and I\\" and #30 \\"Swing Time.\\"  Why?  Because these are movies where the dancing substitutes for the sex.  Actually, is there a hotter sex scene than the dance scene in \\"The King and I\\"?  Also, for good measure, toss in #95 \\"Lady and the Tramp\\" which also features a romance from opposite sides of the track, and #19 \\"Ghost,\\" because it also stars Swayze.
B000066NW0|5.0|Anything But Ordinary would sum up the sound that Avril gives out on her debut cd Let Go.  It is really refreshing to listen to her music because it has all these different feelings expressed through her music and it is one of those cds where you just don't skip songs because they're all so good.  If you really listen carefully you can feel what she was feeling whe she wrote that song and I myself find it comforting to know that other people like her have experienced the same things as me such as the song Things I'll Never Say.  I can really relate to a lot of her songs on the album if not all of them.  I would recommend this album to male and female alike, any person looking for a kick a** new sound with style and heart.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I got this CD as a gift and enjoyed it ok.  Then went onto the computer to hear other things that were not widely released, as I hear that his live shows are great and I noticed that his set lists have many more songs than I have ever heard.  After listening to some downloaded music, I realized that most of my favorite songs are not on the CD and all my least favorite songs are.  So if you like this guy, I would download all his songs and burn your own CD, if possible.  If not, buy this CD.  And by the way, Mayer has a music-sharing friendly policy about his stuff so I don't feel like I am stealing (like if I were doing this for Metallica).
B000002TQB|5.0|Awhile ago, I had picked up the Best of Blur to see if it was worth buying. While listening to it, I became inspired. Noticing a large(but not intimidating back catalog), I decided to give some of their actual albums a shot. Seeing as how Parklife was their most critcally acclaimed album, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. While I didn't warm up to it right away, it has nuzzled its way into one of my current favorites.<br />Tight song writing and great lyrical hooks are some of the main draws of this CD. What really helps this CD out is the almost XTC Skylarking-esque orchastration on all the songs. But where to me, XTC's music comes of as Medival folk, Parklife embodies the working class of Britain. With that in mind, Blur proceeds to poke fun in a satirical manner with lyrics that light and amusing, the band comes back with catchy numbers and great varation. To the disco beat of Girls & Boys and London Loves, to the quirk rock sounds of Parklife and Bank Holiday, each song remains fresh. Above all else, this CD features some of the most consistant song writing for an album with 16 tracks.<br />I still recommend Best Of Blur as an introduction for all the would be Blur fans for a great view of all their work, Parklife is possibly the best place to start. It stands as their best work that I've heard and one of the best Brit-pop CDs I've heard. I have a feeling I'll be listening to this one for awhile.
B000063K2W|4.0|I just saw the play, & I loved it.  At first, I thought I wouldn't find anything intersesting about this story.  But in a very funny way you see how horrible things can go with spreading gossip.  It was sad to see all the people who were hurt by the gossips of others, but to see them overcome & become better people by the lesson made it even more interesting to watch.
B00000I14Z|4.0|Parts of this historical recording are very interesting because they show the emergence of a creator on the edge of future greatness.Three cuts really stand out:BETTER GIT IT IN YOUR SOUL,GOODBYE PORK PIE HAT and FABLES OF FAUBUS.Each of these tracks demonstrates that MINGUS is willing to strech out his talent in a variety of styles.The rest of the stuff is quite uneven and the bonus tracks are not that great.As it is,this cd is definetetly worth buying for jazz fans.Don't expect a masterpiece like ROUND MIDNIGHT (DAVIS) or IMPRESSIONS(COLTRANE) and you'll get satisfaction.
B000000OUW|5.0|If this album would have only had one song on it and that song would have been the last one (The Power) it would still rate as my second favorite Manowar album (nothing on Earth beats Kings of Metal)but with other incredible songs like Courage, Outlaw and King, it is oh so close to being as good. For those that get the Manowar concept I can't think of anything more awesome than the intensity of The Power. The song just oozes that very feeling with every chord, every beat, and every word Eric Adams roars into the microphone. I've had \\"new-bie\\" metalheads telling me Manowar was old and not heavy enough. Put this song on (or Outlaw for that matter) crank it to the max and that'll shut em up fast. Simply awe striking.<BR>But that's just one song, the rest of the album is outstanding too !! In fact I can't really find anything I don't love on this album, even the two instrumantals are cool, although the second one is admittedly a little weaker than the first. Buy this album !! If you like Manowar, buy this album !! If you like Heavy Metal, buy this album !! If you have any sense whatsoever, buy this masterpiece now !!!<br />HAIL MANOWAR !!!!!!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avrile Lavigne has got the hit song and now an amazing album.Avril has a style all of her own and she is only 17.Unlike most pop stars Avril wrote all the music on her debut(Unlike Britney,etc).Eve since I first heard \\"Complicated\\" on the radio I was instantly hooked.The song is so true to life and is amazingly written.But it doesn't stop there.The whole album is full of fresh songs that are all amazing.Avril can go all punked out(like in the fabulous song \\"Sk8er Boi\\")and sing out a heartfelt balad(like in the album's best track \\"I'm With You\\").<BR>Avril is someone I hope to hear more and more from as years go on.Congratulations Avril,you have made one amazing album that will be in my stereo all the time.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. is, in my opinion, PJ's best album, on a number of levels:<BR>First of all, it is the deepest of the 7 albums, without one of those songs in which you feel like hitting the &quot;Skip&quot; button. Every other album (yes, even Ten) has one, whether it's &quot;Heyfoxymophandlemamathatsme,&quot; or &quot;Habit.&quot; Secondly, Vs. has an excellent variety of tunes: Slow, melodic songs (Elderly Woman, Indifference), faster, harder tunes (Leash, Animal, Go), mid-tempo ballads (Daughter, Dissident) and emotional, powerful songs (Blood, RVM, W.M.A). This variety may exist on other albums, most notably &quot;No Code&quot;, but not to the extent that it exists on Vs. Finally, Vs. has the single greatest PJ song ever to be included in a studio album (thereby excluding &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; and the epic &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot;), Rearview Mirror. If you are looking to get into Pearl Jam, &quot;Vs.&quot; and, more specifically, &quot;Rearview Mirror&quot;, is the place to start. RVM is Pearl Jam in its purest, most epitomic form, and Vs. typifies PJ like no other album, even Ten.
B000002TQV|5.0|this is the best Radiohead album ever. enough said.
B000069AT7|5.0|i was very disapointed when i know that this classic movies started to follow STARWARS' foot step and re-releasing the special edition with new digital scenes.<br />and i was going to ignore this re-release of this DVD and stick with my older version i have on VHS.  it is nonsense to change thing that is already great!<br />but the \\"1982 version\\" that is included in this DVD is what change everything.  this is a definite must have for a fan of this movie.  Finally, someone at universal did the right thing!
6305827079|5.0|THE GREATEST CONCERT FILM OF ELVIS COMES TOGETHER RIGHT HERE.  TO ME HIS STRONGEST PERIOD WAS 1968-70, RIGHT AFTER HIS COMEBACK SPECIAL IN 1968, RIGHT THROUGH LAS VEGAS IN 1970, WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS.  THE KING BLASTS OUT ALL THE HITS; HE COMES ROCKIN' TO THE STAGE WITH &quot;THAT'S ALL RIGHT MAMA&quot; AND GOES RIGHT INTO &quot;I'VE GOT A WOMAN,&quot; &quot;HOUND DOG,&quot; AND &quot;HEARTBREAK HOTEL.&quot;  ANOTHER SIDE OF ELVIS WE SEE IN THIS CONCERT IS THE FUNNY SIDE -- HIS JOKING AROUND WITH HIS &quot;BABY GUITAR&quot; AND OTHER COMICAL JOKES.  IT IS ALL RIGHT HERE, AND SURE, MANY CD'S HAVE BEEN ISSUED OF ELVIS IN LAS VEGAS (SOME OF WHICH I HAVE), BUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE ELVIS ON STAGE -- NO INTERUPTIONS, NO &quot;WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK,&quot; AND BEST OF ALL, NO INTERVIEWS.  JUST ONE BIG CONCERT.  AND SO PURCHASE IT AND ENJOY THE KING AT HIS BEST, AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE &quot;GOOD ROCKIN' TONIGHT.&quot;
0345440900|5.0|My child was 2 (not really a baby anymore) and it took us anywhere between 2-3 hours nightly to get him to go to sleep.  We tryed everything but he refused to sleep.  My husband and I were exhausted when my sister visited who also has a two year old.  She had used this book at about 9 months to get her daughter to sleep and helped me with the technique.  Within 3 nights it took only less than a minute for him to go to sleep.  My husband and I are still lost for what to do with this time!  Please, read the book, and stick with it.  Don't give in to them.  I promise that they only benefit from this method!  If we have a second child (which is more likely now that our son sleeps) I will start this from day one.  No more rocking for me!
B000051ZST|4.0|Concerning the movie Road Trip, I was curious to know if viewers caught the lifting of Animal House scenes.  It seemed so intentional, I thought it may have been done as some kind of tribute:<br />The Tom Green role as an eight year student reminded me of the famous John Belushi line &quot;Seven years of college down the drain&quot;  <br />Taking the car of the hapless nerd Kyle (DJ Qualls), for the road trip wheels, was a duplicate of Otter and Boon deciding to commandeer the car of Flounder.  Of course, both cars   eventually get thrashed.<br />The African American college scene was a mirror image to the Animal House crew inadvertently ending up in a night club obviously frequented by black patrons only.   <br />Any others?
B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Let Go\\" is the only CD in my pile that I have almost burned out! It is a great album for letting all of your frustrations out and it's great for just having fun, whether you're by yourself or with a bunch of friends! Avril Lavigne's Pop/Rock songs are all very catchy...some deep and intense, some light hearted and fun and some in the middle. But her voice is the one thing that you can't get enough of. Every time you hear it, you feel like you're relating to her and it's a great experience. She's a teenage and more &quot;punkier&quot; version of Alannis Morrissett who knows how to entertain. I definitely recommend \\"Let Go\\" for a worthwhile CD that you will never stop listening to!
B00005QDW5|5.0|At long last there is a complete compilation of Pink Floyd's music that does the group justice.  Mind you, it is not perfect, but what can you expect from over thirty years of groundbreaking music placed onto two CD's?<br />Running from the early days of &quot;See Emily Play&quot; to older material like, &quot;High Hopes&quot;, the absolute best is here with few exceptions.  Half of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; are represented here as well.  Pink Floyd has always been noted for being an 'album' recording group with very few singles until the later years.  Also well known for thier concerts, the double CD, &quot;Pulse&quot; sold millions.<br />This set does not track from inception to end like most collections, but rather mixes the songs up non-chronologically making for a more appreciative listen.  The only gripe this author has is the quick cut at the ends of songs instead of a slow 'fade-out'.  It can be jarring.  However, it is not so bad that some of the originally longer songs have been shortened.  Only hard-core fans will notice the edits (i.e. &quot;Echoes&quot;).<br />The liner notes are fairly all-inclusive with some fun information and album shots.  It's a great collector box for those who don't wish to buy all the Pink Floyd recordings - but that wouldn't hurt.
B000062TU1|5.0|I originally made the mistake of purchasing the Wide Screen option of this film, only to find well over a third of my screen wasted and the darker scenes difficult to see, at best.  As soon as I realized a Full Screen Version was available, also at a reasonable cost, I couldn't purchase it fast enough.  The whole family is MUCH happier now.  Everyone from 16 to 74 LOVES the movie!  My only concern is that at the speed (or lack thereof) the books and movies are being released, that the actors/actresses are going to be approaching their 30's by the time they &quot;finish&quot; school at Hogwarts&quot;.  I hope things can pick up the pace, because I am 47 years old and I certainly want to live long enough to finish the series!  I have enjoyed this series more than most any books I've read in years! :-)
B00004XPP0|5.0|With George Lucas becoming an overrated, bloated egomaniac and completely sucking the life and adventure out of the once promising series, the classic \\"original\\" trilogy is the only Lucas road worth traveling. Watch these movies and compare them with the two recent prequels, and you will see many differences in quality. Sure, the new ones are amped up on SFX steroids, but are missing the heart that the semi-low budget \\"A New Hope\\" had. My favorite movie out of the trilogy would probably be The Empire Strikes back, which completely destroys \\"A New Hope\\" in my opinion. I recently bought this trilogy and enjoyed watching it because it reminded me of when I was really small and I used to own all 3 movies in their original packaging (Too bad they got sold at a lawn sale 8 years ago). Oh yeah, George, if you're watching, bring back Chewbacca.
B000065U1N|4.0|Great movie if you enjoy blood and guts war movies.  I had trouble keeping track of who was who (amoung the good guys), couldn't really find a plot, but it was certainly realistic and kept you on the edge of your seat.  I veiwed this with 4 males who all agreed with my assesment, which surprised me, especially considering the awesome reveiews the movie had gotten.  Did drag out at places and could have been done in less time.
B00003CX9E|3.0|\\"Citizen Kane\\" is heralded by the critics and even given the highest honor by AFI via being awarded \\"greatest film of motion picture history\\". these are the facts.<br />this is my opinion:<br />i viewed this film years ago on videocassette. i didn't understand then the notoriety sorrounding the film and didn't understand it after viewing it on DVD recently. i was only slightly entertained by a few fleeting moments in the film. overall, i found this film boring and intolerably long.<br />normally i have extreme respect and adoration for the classics except a few, and this is one of those rarities. it merits 3 stars from me only because of the notorious scandal it caused.<br />as for the DVD, it's quality is superb in picture and audio. the extras are more than sufficient. Amazon lists these on thier site.
B00005YUNY|5.0|This is their best live dvd/video thus far. The sound and picture quality are perfect. No stupid effects like in &quot;Keys..&quot;<BR>It also comes with a second disc with a &quot;Behind the scenes&quot; thing for this tour and the video for &quot;Don't Go&quot;. My only complaint is that it doesn't have Rick or Tony on keyboards. They have another new guy on keyboards. Nowhere near as good as the other guys, but at least he doesn't completely ruin it. If you've never bought a live Yes dvd before, this would definitely be a good one to start with. Now if they would just release a live dvd with the Trevor Rabin/Tony Kaye line-up. hint hint
B000002BYD|4.0|This is a pretty good album, spawning in my opinion Pearl jam's best single (Wishlist), but overall it is just good. Eddie Veddar sounds tired, and the energy that they had on Ten and Vs. just isn't there, they just seem to be slumping, esp. on the guitar, I miss the ripping solos that McCready played on Ten, but here, if there is a solo in the song, its a couple of notes or so. The standout tracks are - Given to Fly, Wishlist, and In Hiding, every other one you can pretty much pass up.
0553381709|5.0|This one does not let you down; if you've gotten to the point where you're considering this book, you must have read the first two (you should, you know, or you'll be utterly lost in this one...And the series is amazing quest fanatasy, taken to the next level). So I'll just say that Martin has done it, again, and this one is better than the first two. The only disappointment is that you need to wait for the next book, once you finish this one, and you know you're only half way through the overall story...
B000066NW0|5.0|The first girl rocker I could relate to was Gwen Stefani, an awesome girl with an awesome voice. Then Alanis Morrisette, Nelly Furtado, then Michelle Branch. Now, the new meaning of awesome girl rock is Avril Lavinge.<br />With Avril's first album, &quot;Let Go&quot;, we see a whole new side of this rock and understand why she well... rocks. With each song comes a different emotion, different sound, and different light in which we see Avril and the way she sees life.<br />Each song I can relate to, each song I can sing with, each song inspires me to become more involved with my own songwriting and playing guitar. This is defiantly music for everyone to listen to. It can get them pumped, get them to realize life, maybe become interested in more of writing and music. Hey, she was a small town girl and now she's playing with the big boys now, right? <br />This CD is probably the best we'll hear all summer. Each song has a different mood and you can listen to it in the car, in your room, sitting on the computer, trying to wind down from a long day, anything and anywhere. Avril has the magic in her words, her voice, and in her music to transfor our lives from boring to cool. &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; makes you want to mosh, &quot;My World&quot; makes you realize that you're not the only one who takes such long showers, &quot;These Things I'll Never Say&quot; may get you out of that shell, &quot;Complicated&quot; may inspire you to be who you really are, and the list goes on. If anyone this summer is looking for a great CD, this is it.
B000066NW0|5.0|I would have to say that Avril Lavigne's Let Go, is one of the best albums that I have heard in while. I believe she is one of the best, if not the best young female artists out there right now. Since she wrote the songs, you, as a listener can really realate to the lyrics. Songs like &quot;Im With You&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; are, I believe, are so well written, listing to them almost bring you to tears. These are real words, and Lavine is a real person. I have no doubt her next album will only be better!
B00000DLUV|5.0|LIVE albums I've heard. Every song a winner.  I am a big Bee Gees's fan and have most of their albums but this is one of my favorites.  Highly recommend.
B00003CX8J|4.0|Hey, I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it at the cinema.  I've just finished watching the DVD version and I thoroughly enjoyed it all over again.  X-Men is a simple, unpretentious movie based on the famous comic book series of which I have never read one issue.  Smooth acting from Patrick Stewart hold this movie together and is compimented by a nice performance from Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Anna Paquin (Rouge).  I found the other actors a little too cheesey for my liking, but thats probably a true reflection of their comic book characters.  The movie has cool, but not overly ground-breaking special effects.  The plot is pretty basic, but that's comic books for you. The movie runs along at a nice pace and is pretty much action packed from beginning to end.  The DVD has some nice extra features.  All in all this is a fun movie which I have enjoyed on two occasions.  I won't be viewing it again for a long time, and I'm undecided as to wether it deserves a place in my DVD collection.  Recommended viewing for Science Fiction fans.
B000066NW0|5.0|I just listened to the complete Avril Lavigne CD twice and I have to tell you I have not been this excited about a CD since I first listened to Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\", although these two albums are not alike. The only likeness is that every song on each is amazing and fresh. <br />My favorite is \\"I'm with you\\", it just displays a wonderful quality in it that captures so much the feelings of being young and wanting so much to be loved....I also really like \\"My World\\", it has a catchy \\"hook\\" in it....<br />This CD is going to be a summer fave for music fans everywhere, it is upbeat even in the more serious songs, you get the feeling that Avril is going to be OK because she is a strong girl and wouldn't let anything get her down....<br />I remember the first time I saw the Britney Spears video and I said then that she would be a star....Avril Lavigne will be one as well....and I predict she'll be even bigger because she is REAL....and hopefully she will stay \\"true to herself\\"...I personally believe this small town girl will be one of the biggest stars we see emerge in years.<br />Best of luck Avril, this is an AMAZING CD!!!!!
B00003Q43A|3.0|Independence Day is a very entertaining movie.  The special effects are excellent and Will Smith's humour is as usual, spot on.  The story-line is pretty weak, but that's okay, this is a movie designed to entertain, not make you think.  The initial build up and deployment of the alien space craft is my favourite segment of the movie.  It's the second part of the movie that things start to go wrong.  There are just too many cheesey bits which ruin the movie.  Will Smith's first encounter with the downed alien craft is a huge disappointment.  He sees an alien, punches it, then sits back and has a cigar.  Nice line \\"Welcome to earth\\", but the whole scene is a real let down.  One punch and the alien is knocked out? What about other aliens in the craft?  What about his curiosity as to what else is inside the craft, he is a pilot who wants to be an astronaut for crying out loud?  Then there are other ridiculous scenes such as the President giving his patriotic speech, which sounds like it was written to be given to a whole nation, or nations and he delivers it to a handful of people.  But the worst part of the movie for me, was when a handful of civilians (albiet Vietnam vets) end up flying F18's.  This unfortunately is just stretching things too far. At the risk of getting some negative feedback for this review, I found it pretty sycophantic when the movie panned around the world, to see military survivors from different nations listening in to the Americans.  The British soldier made the comment about relying on the Americans. This scene merely shows Americans as being full of the themselves and condescending and wasn't necessary.  Overall, I enjoyed this movie, but it misses the mark terribly for the reasons above.  The Five Star Collection version is the equivilant of my Region 4 Special Edition version.  And what a great DVD package this is.  Two CD's, full colour booklet, and a host of extra features.
0446678430|3.0|The book helped me overcome several of my self imposed limitations, and also helped me understand the roots of my limitations. (Think outside the box as Robert puts it). All in all, I'd have to say it was very easy reading and the author succeeded in getting most of his points across very clearly. <br />The bad points: On average, every 10 pages or so you will find plugs for his other money making ventures such as his game, his other books, and his seminars. I agree with one of the other reviews in that he does not go into detail about how he managed to build his empire while keeping away from the employee way of thinking, which was what I really wanted to hear about. Also, he makes tons of references to his other books, and things that he mentions in them, so at times, I felt like I was reading a second hand book.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's debut album,&quot;Let Go&quot;, is amazing and full of emtions. Her great songs go from telling you stories of life(my world, or anything but ordinary)to telling you about love and relationships(sk8er boi, i'm with you) to even about just being yourself and not worrying about what others think(Complicated). Her wonderful voice and lyrics accompanied by her great band will keep you singing along and you'll be unable to stop playing the album.
B00005JKNC|4.0|When I rented this I thought the concept sounded interesting, and I'm a &quot;somewhat&quot; Jim Carrey fan.  What I got I did not expect.  This is simply one of the most decent, engaging, and well-acted movies I've seen in years.  I just cannot get over the transformation Jim Carrey made to serious drama.  You won't find a frame of film where he exhibits the old Jim Carrey faces or mannerisms.  He is quite seriously a completely different person in this movie.<BR>To describe it would give too much away.  But I can compare it, as others have, to a modern take on Frank Capra movies.  Jim's character experiences self-reflection as Jimmy Stewart did in &quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot;, and also the little-guy-against-the-estabilshment scenario from &quot;Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.&quot;  All of this set against the historical backdrop of the McCarthy hearings.  But make no mistake -- this is not a movie that takes political sides or is full of typical Hollywood activism and rhetoric.  It was a refreshing change.<BR>I've heard such unflattering descriptions as &quot;corny&quot; and &quot;sappy&quot; and must disagree completely.  Those descriptions are applied by people who cannot relate to the basic concepts of friends, family, community, honor, and freedom as portrayed in this movie.  These concepts remind some folks of their own weaknesses and regrets, and they react with contempt and disdain at their presentation.  If you are one of them, this movie is not for you.<br />I plan on buying this one.
B000066NW0|5.0|Buy this CD guys. This Cd is great! you WILL NOT REGRET IT! Trust me. This goes beyond good, or great or fantastic. It is the greatest hip hop, punk, rock, and pop Cd I have ever heard. No matter what kind of music you like, you will like Avril. Trust me! I like all kinds of diff. music, from Jazz, to Punk. From Rock to Opera. I like it all, and this is my fav. Cd i have ever had. It is that good. I love it, and you will to. So, please go out and but it! PLEASE!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Always wonder &quot;Where have you been all my life&quot;  That is an easy though as you listen to the beats, the melodies and harmonies of Wilco.  This CD also seems to reflect some of the feelings of 9/11 in songs like War on War, Jesus Etc, and Ashes of American Flags.  I also learned that the group will be having a moive coming out in augest or something like that please check it out.  Go Wilco

B000067FP7|5.0|Warner Brothers has finally decided to release a special edition of this Spielberg-Produced horror flick. \\"Gremlins,\\" directed by Joe Dante, tells the story of an inventor who buys a \\"mogwai\\" for his son as Christmas gift. This mogwai is a little furry critter who comes with three rules. 1) Keep him out of bright light, especially sunlight. 2) Don't get him wet. 3) The most important of all...never, ever feed him after midnight. Of course, accidents do happen and Gizmo, the mogwai, gets wet. He multiplies and the new bunch of mogwai are very nasty. They trick their master into feeding them after midnight. This causes them to form cocoons and when they hatch they're big and leathery. Now the Gremlins must be stopped. You'll have to buy the dvd to find out how. It really is an underrated movie. The special effects are surprisingly convincing, especially when they're all puppets. Plus, this thing even has deleted scenes. Buy it now.
B00005UKE0|5.0|The Electronic Sound is wonderful.George was a master songwriter with such Beatles track as 'Something' and 'Here Comes The Sun'.&quot;I Live for You&quot; further highlights the album's oft overlooked country facet; spare takes of &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; and &quot;Let It Down&quot; underscore the strength of Harrison's songwriting;
B00005OM4N|5.0|I brought this album on the day it came out and i was instantly hooked. I listen to it all the time, even now, after 8 months. here's what i think of all the songs:<BR>SLAVE4U: well, you've probably heard it before. Very sexy and grown up. <BR>OVERPROTECTED: very catchhy. people who feel overprotected by parents, boyfriend etc can relate to this song.<BR>LONELY: Britney gets aggresive to an ex-boyfriend who wants her back, i was expecting Britney to swear in the line 'I wouldn't take your *HUH* no more.<BR>NOT A GIRL: this album shows how much she has grown but as britney explains in this song, she's not a girl, not yet a woman... all she needs is time.<BR>BOYS: this song is great! very catchy. i like the quote she says at the end of the song 'boys...can't live with 'em...can't live without 'em!<BR>ANTICIPATING: I hated this song at first but it's grown on me. very 70s pop.<BR>I LOVE ROCK N ROLL: this song will make you wanna scream along with them.<BR>CINDERELLA: another song i used to hate but i like now. typical pop. i think this song lets britney down, the album is supposed to show how much britney has grown but she puts a song called 'cinderella' on it.<BR>LET ME BE: i think this songs alright but nothing special.<BR>BOOMBASTIC LOVE: this song has a fast beat and i love it.<BR>THAT'S WHERE YOU TAKE ME: a slushy ballad with is good when your in a lovey dovey mood.<BR>WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE ME: i really like this song. juustin appears in this song. guarenteed to get you singing along.<br />...
B000001EGA|5.0|The &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; make 1 in Billboard Charts in 1975.All the songs in this album is great.&quot;Someone saved my life tonight&quot; a great solo piano song and Elton voice was great.&quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; was a massive hit, a great rocker.&quot;Lucy in the sky with diamonds&quot; was great(John Lennon play vocals)<BR>In my opinion , this is the best album in 1975 and one of best rock and roll albums<BR>THIS ALBUM IS ESSENTIAL
B000066796|5.0|I saw this movie today for the very first time.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes romantic comedy's, back in time movies, or ordinary girl meets rich and handsome Prince Charming.  It is sort of a Cinderella-type movie and Hugh Jackman was excellent as the British Duke.  He goes back in time to the present day (modern times) and of course, it seems very ackward to him.  But he soon adjusts and falls in love with Meg Ryan's character.  Meg Ryan was excellent also, especially when she finally gave in to Hugh Jackman's (The Duke's) charms and old-fashioned values.  For girls, they will wish that they could meet someone from this time period who is as handsome and charming as Hugh Jackman (The Duke).  Their fate at the end of the movie determines their destiny to be together.  She goes back to his world in the 18th Century from the present day.<br />This is a movie that you will want to watch over and over again!
B00003CXDV|5.0|This film is nearly flawless.  The casting and acting were superb, and the dialogue was exceptional.  Many movies that try to blend comedy and science fiction come across as overly silly (Spaceballs) or just plain bad (Starship Troopers).  This film has great comedic parody coupled with a strong plot and even some moving scenes. If you are a fan of science fiction or comedies, you can't go wrong with this DVD.
B00005JL3A|5.0|Anderson has done an excellent job of keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. It's an amazing film that will keep you jumping all the way through.
B000065U1N|5.0|If you got this far, i will skip the plot basics. Suffice to say that this film makes no commentary on the rights or wrongs of the situation, there is no rah-rah flag waving, just pure, honest emotion. The story of the soldiers that faced a difficult situation, their courage and comradship is proof that the ancient art of soldiering has not changed since its early days - its not about the fight, its about the people, the brothers-in-arms that are your family. I strongly recommend this film for its good historical accuracy, lack of political focus, excellent acting, directing, sound and photography.
B000066NW0|5.0|17-year-old Avril Lavigne isn't pretending to be anything she's not. Her lyrics are down-to-earth while catchy, and the melodies range from punk rock to soft ballads. It's hard to define exactly what genre this CD falls into, but let's just say that she's a little bit of Alanis Morissette, Michelle Branch, Pink, Bif Naked, Sarah McLachlan, and Heather Nova wrapped up in a semi-skater punk, semi-teenage-girl-in-love package. \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" and \\"My World\\" are probably the two most autobiographical tracks on the album, the first an empowering individualistic anthem describing wanting \\"to know that I have been to the extreme\\", the second talking about growing up in the 5,000 population town of Napanee. Each and every song is worth repeat listenings, and this album deserves a place in the CD racks of every non-Britney-... music-obsessed teenage girl.<br />\\"If you don't like me for who I am, then don't like for who I am - and all you're going to get is who I am,\\" Avril tells us in the video interview on the CD. That's what you've got here. No pretending, just great music.
B000001Y2U|5.0|I have had so many copies of this cd and they always get stolen or something...so, i'm going to try with this one, good cd. I don't even like Manson very much, but this was a good one, must have for the cd collection!
0920668372|5.0|The text, Love You Forever, takes young people through the full \\"circle of life.\\"  When times at home get rough, often, parent-child relationships can get strained.  What can turn into an extended fight over virtually nothing could perhaps be stopped if the book was required reading for both parties.  The old saying, \\"You won't know what you're missing until it's gone\\" (is that correct?  something like that).  When a child is actually \\"forced\\" to confront the parent/child relationship as one that will eventually end, a new perspective can be found.  Similarly, a parent who is constantly finding fault in a young one can be \\"revitalized\\" by this book, knowing that there will be a day when he or she can no longer \\"rock his/her child back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.\\"
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan is simply amazing. If you like Good Charlotte, Blink 182, and New Found Glory. You'll love these guys. All the tracks on \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\" are great. Especially \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and \\"I'd Do anything\\" There live show is also something to see. So make sure to look up these guys....
B000003N7K|5.0|As so many of these excellent reviews have said, this disc is an incredible experience. The warmth &amp; tenderness of these songs convey the experiences of romantic love so well that it's pointless for me to try describing it with mere words. All of the emotions that make up romantic love: tenderness, passion, perhaps some tinges of sadness and regret, along with tremendous longing are present in these songs in ways both subtle and provacative.<br />I agree completely with one of the excellent reviewers who stated that it is incorrect to consider John Coltrane as a &quot;sideman&quot; to Johnny Hartman. This is truly an artistic collaboration that entailed one of the musical giants of the twentieth-century working with a woefully underated vocalist. With the wonderfully understated piano of McCoy Tyner, whispering bass by Jimmy Garrison and immaculate jazz drumming by Elvin Jones, this is sublime music.

B00001U0DP|4.0|Guido is an Italian Jew that owns a bookstore.  He meets a gentile woman, they marry and have a son.  Then WWII breaks out and the whole family is herded off to a concentration camp.  This doesn't sound like the plot synopsis of a comedy, but this is no ordinary comedy.  It is a heartwarming affirmation of life, as Guido tries to shield his son from the horrors of the camp by making a game out of it.  Guido makes up the rules as he goes along: \\"You must hide and never let the angry people [the guards] see you - we get 50 points for every day you stay hidden!\\"<br />There are many things to like about the film.  The performances are charming (Benigni won an Oscar as Guido).  The screenplay is well-constructed, in that it doesn't shy away from the reality of the holocaust (e.g., Guido's elderly uncle is dispatched in the gas chamber), but can still be sweet and funny.  In fact, the jarring effect of arriving at the concentration camp is more pronounced in this film because it's so farcical and lighthearted in the beginning.<br />This DVD version has clean video and audio (at least, on the Italian track - I have not listened to the dubbed version).  Unfortunately, as is typical of Mirimax, the extras on the DVD are mostly promotional materials.  For example, the Making Of featurette is essentially a half hour of sound bits from people praising the film.  Some are convincing, such as the director of the Simon Weisenthal Centre stating how the film is important for raising awareness of the Holocaust.  But where are the dissenting views?  It is well-known that Steven Spielberg hated the film because he felt it belittled the Holocaust.  Another feature is a complete (?) set of about 20 television ads, all of which are about the same, each with a different award that the film won.  What's the point of that?  There is no commentary, no deleted scenes, etc.  All-in-all, there's no reason to buy the DVD over the VHS except possibly for the choice of subtitles/language tracks.<br />Thus, this film is fantastic, and deserves better in the DVD format than this version gives.
0312265859|4.0|Like others, I grabbed the book as soon as it was out, and then read it during a plane trip.  Yes, there were times I laughed out loud (and got strange looks); and it was entertaining and I'd recommend it.  The ending, however, seemed somewhat contrived; and you find yourself asking why it couldn't have happened some 30 or more pages earlier.  Some of the scenes also seemed copied verbatim from an earlier book.  I wouldn't hesitate to get the next one; but this one was not as good as ealier books.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Pauline Kael, bless her heart, considered this film a failure: she thought Roman Polanski's trauma over wife Sharon Tate's murder was behind the film's tone (hopeless) and approach (explicit), to the extent that it got in the way of his artistic judgment. It's true that Polanski shows us the violence, whereas Shakespeare kept it offstage; but there is nothing sensational or cavalier in the film's carnage. Besides which, it's not just the violence that is raw. Polanski conjures up Scotland of the Dark Ages in every bleak detail: in the dank castle corridors, in the harsh landscapes. There is no splendor here. It may be the most lived-in adapation of Shakespeare ever filmed. It is Polanski's dogged verisimilitude that puts this movie over the top. <br />Orson Welles directed an austere but compelling 'Macbeth,' and Akira Kurosawa based his great 'Throne of Blood' on it (culminating in one of the most spectacular finales in film -- Toshiro Mifune as human pin-cushion). But Polanski's adaption is the one that will haunt your dreams. Not for the faint of heart, or even \\"brave\\" hearts...<br />(P.S. I cannot write about this movie without acknowledging that severed arm the witches bury in the sand. As one of the most unforgettable body parts in cinema, it's right up there with the severed ear in 'Blue Velvet' and the ant-infested hand in Bunuel's 'Un chien andalou.')
B00005JKJA|5.0|I honestly don't understand how a person can feel qualified enough to bash this movie. David Lynch is a true artist, and the beauty of his films is that they cannot be taken in one sitting. This isn't Dude, Where's My Car. This isn't a movie for the lazy armchair critic. The best movies are not the ones that are great in one viewing. They are the ones that make you come back again and again.
0679746048|4.0|If you have ever been depressed, institutionalized, had a bad day, or have lived on this planet, this book is a must-read for you! When Susanna Kaysen was eighteen years-old, a psychiatrist sent her to McLean Hospital after learning that she had once attempted suicide, and having an interview that lasted roughly fifteen minutes. From there, it was a two-and-a-half year odyssey out of depression and confusion, and back to mental health. <br />Along the way, Kaysen met many colorful characters, some eccentric yet sane (the patients), some not-quite sane at all (the staff). In detail, Kaysen describes the antics of Lisa: a ribald and provocative sociopath, the illness of Polly: a depressive who lit herself on fire, and the plight of Daisy: a bulimic who is a victim of incest. Kaysen herself is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. In this book, time has little meaning, and Kaysen often flashes back-and-forth between her being in the hospital, before she went in, and after, with little sequence at all. It reads sort of like an out-of-order diary.<br />This book is so skillfully written. When you first open it up, there are summaries seemingly copied right out of Kaysen's hospital records. The story itself, is written poignantly with compassion for both captors and captives. Kaysen aptly captures both the Hell and the hilarity of being in a mental institution with realism, and how somehow, in spite of it all, she manages to get better and move back on-track. Another thing that is a relief about it, is that Kaysen does not blame her problems on her family or some great trauma or even being misunderstood. It was simply that she didn't understand. Yet did that really merit her being locked up?<br />I read this book two years ago, and when I first did, I was wishing it would be more dramatic, I found parts of it dull. However, it is the type of book which you want to hang onto and keep coming back to, because it is so informative and really is ground-breaking. While Susanna Kaysen points out the flaws of her being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and the stigma towards psychiatric hospital patients, she does not write with hatred, rather with empathy. There really is no villain in this book, except for life itself. The movie, which I liked, is completely different from the book, more dramatic. I recommend it, but it cannot substitute for the book. Kaysen writes with great insight about the courage to survive one's difficulties and the courage to heal.
0385335482|5.0|Move over Bridgett Jones - we have a new &quot;it&quot; girl from England. Sophie Kinsella's Confessions of a Shopaholic is a MUST read for anyone who likes to shop or knows someone who does. <BR>Becky Bloomwood, financial journalist and shopper extraordinaire, has a big problem. A BIG line of credit and a very small paycheck. In addition, she can't seem to stop shopping. Told thru Becky's point of view as well as letters from the bank - Confessions is a can put it down kind of book. <BR>The reader, who instantly wants to take Becky under their wing and offer words of advice, is transported to Becky's dull day job as a financial reporter - copying press releases and going to one press conference after another, especially the ones run by the largest financial PR firm in London, Brandon Communications, run by the dashing Luke Brandon and his bitchy side-kicks. <BR>Becky tries to heed the advice of experts and friends and cut down on her unending spending, but falls victim to her own desires. Her uncontrollable shopping and creative responses to the debit collectors bring her nothing but trouble. Who hasn't had this problem? <BR>Just as Becky thinks her world is ending - she unsuccessfully tries to date her roommate's millionaire cousin, things turn around for Becky - but to find out how, you'll have to read the book! <BR>Confessions of a Shopaholic is great fun and a good beach or plane read. I can't wait for Sophie Kinsella to write more about Becky Bloomwood's adventures.
B00005Q3KC|5.0|There are some amazing best of CDs. John Hiatt's the AM years and Mirrorball come to mind. Now I only have 2 other Corrs CDs, Forgiven not Forgotten and Live in Dublin and there are many overlaps between those 2 and the songs here, but I am still very glad I bought this CD. ...<br />So what do you get? First you get 72 minutes worth of songs. You get a marvelous version of Everybody Hurts. I have come to realize that Andrea could sing Mary Had a Little Lamb or the Spam song from Monty Python and it would sound wonderful. I like the version they have of So Young and the Radio version is very good. Every song on the CD is fantastic. And just like Mirrorball for me (although I bought another Sarah McLaughlin CD afterwards) if this is your first Corrs CD it is likely to become one of your favorite CDs ...<br />Other favorites are Runaway, still the definitive Corrs song in my mind, I Never Really Loved You Anyway, Love to Love You, What Can I Do. The booklet comes with numerous photos....but they are all very small. I liked the pics of posters of shows and tickets from shows. Also if you have ever seen the video for I Never Really Loved You Anyway it has a very funny ending when they switch instruments and mimic trying to play them. They have a couple of photos from that part of the video. If you have some Corrs CDs but not all then you should get this and if you have no Corrs CDs this is a MUST get, it will Leave You Breathless.
B00005R2IS|5.0|As Bob Denver, for all practical purposes, became \\"Gilligan,\\" in real life -- as Frances Bouvier became \\"Aunt Bea,\\" and Bob Keeshan \\"Captain Kangaroo\\" -- the young and beautiful Melvin Gibson, in this earliest of roles, was incredibly, unbelievably fortunate to avoid career-long typecasting as nothing but a cheesecake, eye-candy, silver-screen pretty-boy.<br />This fine debut film, in which Melvin Gibson had to do little more than look extremely nice, exude male lusciousness and wear tight leather pants, came dangerously close to relegating him to Fabio status, committing him to a relatively brief film future of appearance-only, stand-and-model roles in subsequent movies.  However, the overwhelming power of Melvin's acting talent (facial expressions, talking, walking, and driving vehicles) -- the raw guts of thespian talent and drive -- managed to save him from a perpetuation of calendar pin-up roles, catapulting him to an infinitely higher plane of cinematic accomplishment than is accessible by a mere male model (see Bird On A Wire, The River, Lethal Weapon VII, etc, Melvin's list is literally endless).<br />It was that determination which wrenched Melvin Gibson out of the male-model mold and elevated him to Oscar quality.  Think of Gomer and Goober Pyle, of Herman Munster, Dan Rather and Sheila Jackson Lee... and see how intertwined, how enmeshed, how tied up those actors became with their roles.  Melvin Gibson was lucky to avoid the same sort of typecasting that severely restricted the careers of these unfortunate folks, and would have condemned him to being known for the rest of his life as nothing but a darn good looking hunk of meat (as they say).<br />We all knew Goober Pyle -- and we can all say for a definite fact that Melvin Gibson (Mad Max) is no Goober Pyle.
B000065U1N|3.0|I just rented Black Hawk Down yesterday, and was enthralled by this action packed movie, with a tight direction by Ridley Scott, very good cinematography and fast paced editing to keep you at the edge of your seat. The helicopter scenes offer great stunts, and the fighting is in your face and very raw.<BR>Some of the street fighting scenes/sets reminded me a bit of Full Metal Jacket,while the shadowy and mostly distant 'baddies' (the somali militias) reminded me of the murderous creoles in Southern Comfort or even the gangs of Warriors, chasing the good guys in the claustrophobic hell of a city. And because it is based on true events, the fighting was more poignant.<BR>In a cinematic sense, and although it is a tragic story because it really did happen,it was fresh to see a hard edged war film that is not set in World War II or Vitenam.<BR>BUT, the film left a bitter after taste..and for the following reasons, and I am not going into the real story behind the film and the US involvement etc, since it was well reviewed. <br />1-The whole killing and fighting had a computer game feel to them..if you played Delta Force you will know what i mean. <br />2-It was very violent, and while I suspect Scott wanted to show how brutal that short but very deadly war was, some of the scenes were very graphic..(triggiring in my mind the eternal debate of how studios and censors accept such gore yet flash their scissors and cry 'Murder'at intimacies and sex in movies)<BR>So,do we really need to see so much gore?<br />3-As some reviewers have mentioned, there are no visual background to the US involvement or the somalis condition..What we see of the somalis mostly are the gun totting, trigger happy evil militias who are starving their own people..The scene towards the end of an eldery somali carrying a dead child, is too sentimental, without giving the viewer the background to sympathize with his predicament.<BR>4-it was 144 minutes.. a bit too long I thought, as some scenes, especially in the US base camp dragged on a bit, probably intending to develop some of the soldier's characters, but did not fully work.<BR>So if you expect the excellent Saving Private Ryan or the poetic masterpiece of Thin Red Line, you will be disappointed. However if you want to enjoy an action packed movie,then by all means RENT but don't BUY Black Hawk Down.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is one of my favourite CD's. Tool is a wonderfully intense band, and the art compliments the music great. 'Eulogy' is powerful live! If you own this CD, you know it easily becomes one of your favourties.
B000000WA4|5.0|Mellon Collie is an awesome body of work.  It is stylistically thoroughly incoherent, although texturally quite even.  It is in the tradition of double album excess - although the double cd format takes that a step further.  The quality across the two cds is uneven.  But none of it seems filler as such, just misfiring from Corgan.  Ambition beyond his ability.  Nothing wrong with that.  The sense one gets from listening to this work is of a man in his creative prime wanting to get it all down, so blithely confident in his abilities that he does not feel the need to exercise any critical faculties.<br />Siamese Dream was a magnificent record; huge production, anthemic tracks, warm buzzing guitars.  It was the album where Corgan gained his audience.  This is the album where he challenges that audience.  Where SD was visceral MC is intellectual.  The high points on this album are many.  The introduction of acoustic tracks and the augmentation of the guitar/bass/drums with various instrumentation gives a broader palette than the monochrome SD.  The band take the promise of the previous two albums and deliver such an assured set it is quite staggering.  In terms of songwriting and the melding of this writing with arrangement and performance, the group seem to have really reached a zenith.<br />The band almost takes off on some of this stuff.  Jimmy Chamberlain really is the key (as we soon found out when he went Betty Ford and we got the remarkably bland Adore).  The man is a powerhouse.  <br />Corgan does so many emotions on these two discs.  And he really paints these emotions very starkly.  Yearning, anger, enchantment, alienisation, love, hope, frustration.  <br />What is the key to art?  Edge.  Edge comes from a sense of the unpredictable, the taking of risks, the possibility of failure.  Doing something new that confronts our understanding of form. Sure, there are some misses here but you've got to take risks to come up with something as sensational as this.  Comfortably the highpoint of this band's career and one of the top 5 albums of nineties.
B0000041Z6|5.0|When compared to other sets, Solti's interpretations of the Symphonies are, to my mind, superior because they lack the overblown and adolescent character of many others (including Bernstein's).  Solti understood Mahler's Central European idiom better than most in his generation.  He gives the symphonies a vibrant theatricality in spots, but nonetheless preserves the often small scale intimacy of many of their most charming passages.  The tempi are not mannered, but true to the composer's demands.  This set may not have the same musical strengths of the mono Bruno Walter recordings, but the sound is warm and lifelike, the price is right, and the liner notes are intelligently written.  What more could one want?  Bravo, London, for making these recordings available in a reasonably priced package!
B00005RHGL|5.0|Great movie, great quality, great packaging, great extras.  I'm so glad I waited untill this version came out to buy this movie.  It really adds to the overall feel.
B00006690G|4.0|This is definately Eminem's most mature album yet. It is not as brilliant as The Marshall Mathers LP but it would be hard for any rapper to match that album. If you are a fan of Slim's music, you will love The Eminem Show. The standouts are the first song White America, which brings up a lot of good points against an angry hard bassline. Business is another standout track with a great beat supplied by Dre and a fun Batman & Robin theme. Then there is the Nate Dogg duet 'Till I Collapse, which is perfect and possibly the best song on the album. This album will really let you know what is on Em's mind so you will take his views seriously. Sing For The Moment is Em showing his more personal side and what he cares and feels for in life. He even sings to his daughter on Hailie's Song, which will show people Em as a real person, and not just a 'pistol-packing drug addict'. Say What You Say is another powerful collaboration between Em and Dre, which would be better if it lost the rather uninspired beat. But Dre takes the opportunity to adress Jermaine Dupri and other haters. Em throws sharp lyrical disses at Cannabis on Square Dance, and it will be interesting to see the war evolve between the two. Em's Detroit cronies D-12 make an appearence on When The Music Stops, and they turn in tight performances. Look out for the song Drips, with Em's protege Obie Trice, which is sick and dirty but funny at the same time. You will appreciate Obie's lyrical skill after some time, and see that he sounds like he definately belongs in D-12. I think this album has a lot to say, especially if you're a fan of Em or if you don't take him seriously as a rapper, this will change your mind. He spits rhymes as venomous as anthrax here and you should not miss out on this one.
B00005JKCF|3.0|The first thing that comes to mind when a Superhero film is made is how much is releated to the comics and how many element changes were made. <BR>Though I am a Superman fan, by putting down this Spiderman movie your probably thinking I am comparing well ok Superman 2 is a classic that will always remain top of the pile. <BR>But lets concentrate on this film, some element changes have been made to this comic hero, for starters his suit, the darker red and blue, kind of pulls that comic book feel out of the film and lacks beauty of the original from the series. <BR>The story was good but the movie in my eyes moved past to quickly for me, everything kind of was happening at once. <BR>Green Goblin's suit was made of armour in this film, in the comics it was a tight costume which looked much better. <BR>The special effects were well done, but from someone who is computer minded like me, I kind of felt that a lot of the web swinging and climbing up walls looked unreal. <BR>Spiderman opened in cinemas 14th June in the UK here and lets just say that a few of us were kind of disappointed. <BR>Hollywood its back to the drawing board.
B000001DTM|5.0|I will admit this is not a \\"background\\" album.  You don't put in on, and then do other things that demand your attention if you want to get the most of this album.  This is the mistake I made when I first got it.  After \\"The Joshua Tree\\", with it's larger amount of immediately catchy songs, I was expecting \\"Actung Baby\\" to reach out and grab me.  <br />Not with this one.  You have to pay attention and give it a chance.  If you do, you'll be well rewarded.  Virtually every song in the collection is layered with a lush production of singing, songwriting, and instrumentation that took the band in new directions, while still maintaining the band's sound, and more importantly, it's credibility.  After \\"The Joshua Tree\\", they could have coasted forever, but chose not to.  <br />It is because of this Amazon.thing that I dusted the album off and gave it another chance.  That \\"chance\\" turned out to be more than a half dozen listenings until I was convinced I had a feel for it before I wrote this.  Turns out I was rewarded by almost becoming in awe of what I've been listening to.  The fact that I've noticed several new reviews of this decade-old album just this week shows that it's an all-time clasic.
B00005R2M3|5.0|I truly thought I was going to be disappointed by this album. It seems nowadays if I buy a CD after only hearing one song, the rest of it pretty much [stinks]. Not so with Shakira. I love every song on this CD, even the Spanish versions make me want to sing them and dance around. She has a beautiful voice with that AWESOME rocker chick style that I love oh so much. Her music is poppy yet, like I said before, very much rock and roll. I was astonished to learn that she wrote most of her music AND produced the CD, amazing! This album is now my favorite and is always in my CD player, it's a must have.
B0000025GW|5.0|While I practice religion, and am a big Bob Dylan fan, these would count as nothing towards my feelings towards the album if I didn't think the songs on it were terrific.  While it doesn't have a killer single that stands out, the overall quality of the work remains high for just about every song.  As through his career, his albums have included top-notch musicians, and the addition of Mark Knopfler to this one gives it a distinctive sound.  In fact, one could just listen to the instrumental part of it and be fairly satisfied.<br />But one does not buy a Bob Dylan album for the instrumentals, one buys it for the lyrics.  For those who have problems figuring out what he's talking about on many of his albums, there is no such problem here.  For a few years of his career, Bob Dylan became a born-again Christian, and like a good Christian, tried to give his best to his God.  He hits a home run here, as we have a first-class album from him.  <br />What I like about many of the songs is that they are relatively straight-forward, at least for him.  The hypnotic opener &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; is a challenge to make people think about which side they are on.   &quot;Precious Angel&quot; and &quot;I Believe in You&quot; are flat-out proclamations of faith.  &quot;Man Gave Names to all the Animals&quot; becomes a religious song by leaving out what would be the logical last word of the song.  My kids like to play &quot;Guess the Animal&quot;, so I'm pumping Dylan into them at an early age.

B000000OU4|2.0|WE LIVE HERE is the most disappointing of all the Pat Metheny Group albums in that it is full of cookie-cutter, jazz fusion fluff and watered down, relatively uninteresting melodies -- Pat is capable of so much more. I can honestly say that none of the tunes really grab me. &quot;Here to Stay&quot; is fairly standard, upbeat Metheny -- what one might deem the &quot;hit single&quot; from the album -- but even this pales in comparison to other songs on PMG albums. It feels like Metheny and Co. were simply going through the motions on this album. Following Pat's accomplished solo album SECRET STORY (one of his all-time best) which was a should-have-been PMG album, WE LIVE HERE is just not up to the same standards.
B00005JKNC|5.0|I loved Jim Carrey in &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; also &quot;Pet Detective&quot; but I always thought this guy would be great in a drama or romance. Finally here it is, drama and romance all in one movie. I think this movie will catapult Jim Carrey into a class of serious actors or should I say he will be taken seriously as an actor. This is a really great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It has a cast of great actors and actresses. Weather you buy this DVD or rent it, just watch and I think you will be very pleased. Personally I'm glad I bought this movie. Two thumbs up!
B00005JKCF|5.0|for first im a big fan of spider-man anyways. I was very plesed with the movie that sam raimi brought to the big screen.this movie was exciting from the momment it started. the characters really stood out like tobey maguire did a extremely well job of playing the role as peter parker.as William Dafoe did a good job of playing the role of the green goblin.the fight scenes were really good between the the super hero an the vilian. all and all this is a movie i recemmend for all ages from kids to adults
B000065U1N|5.0|This is a great film depicting yet again another situation where America's fine young men in uniform are put in harm's way only to be abandoned by their own country. It's so refreshing to watch a film showing the men in the military the proud, brave, courageous, honorable men that they are. This film doesn't depict soldiers as the cartoonish soldier who doesn't feel pain. This movie showed their human side, they were friends, they were shot, they were hurt, they died, and they stood next to their buddies protecting each other until they were killed or out of amunition and then killed. A great great movie which every one should watch to acknowledge what the real soldiers were put through.

1573222038|5.0|Entertaining as a picaresque adventure, melodramatic and unexpected, this is at heart a love story between two people raised at opposite ends of British society with every reason to hate each other, yet able to see in the other the best of herself.
0783230370|1.0|Of all the thousands of movies I've seen in my life, I have only walked out on one.  A horrible little waste of celluloid called &quot;Fresh Horses&quot; with Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.  What does that have to do with &quot;Junior&quot;?  Well, &quot;Junior&quot; almost became the second movie for me to walk out on.  I stuck with it, but the whole thing just struck me as desperately unfunny, like a standup comic who only has one good joke but still has 30 minutes left in his routine, so he keeps telling the same joke over and over in different ways hoping the audience doesn't notice.  Sure, some people will laugh the whole way through, but others will just start to squirm and feel bad for the guy.  I felt bad for Arnold... And wasn't this the last comedy he did?  I guess he felt bad too.
B00005YW4H|2.0|Norah has a beguiling voice, to say the least, and her piano playing is strong and confident.  However, the songs on this CD are bland and boring, for the most part, and Norah doesn't do anything special with the songs that are decent:  THE NEARNESS OF YOU is about par with most piano bar performers' renditions.
031286504X|4.0|As the title of this review indicates, this book is not just \\"I Am Legend\\".  In fact, it only makes up about half of the book, the remainder being made up of what I found to be rather pedestrian short stories.  I found this to be rather irksome as there is absolutely no mention anywhere on the book that it contains work other than the title piece.  Other than \\"I Am Legend\\" I thought the stories were rather weak Bradbury rip-offs and not worth any particular note.<br />That said, the title piece is writing of the highest caliber.  \\"I Am Legend\\" is the story of the only man who has survived a plague that has turned the remaining population into vampires.  Admittedly, that sounds rather uninspired, but what gives the plot its heft is that Matheson approaches vampires from a scientific viewpoint.  As the main character struggles to survive, he cuts through the legend surrounding vampires and comes up with a scientific explanation for them.<br />At the same time, he is forced to struggle with his own loneliness and the encroaching madness that it inspires.  He is not altogether sympathetic, but through him Matheson explores the crushing hopelessness that those who are alone feel.  Rather than trying to make a sympathetic vampire, he turns his main character, a normal human, into the freak, the outcast, and explores how reacts.<br />In addition to the interesting psychological elements, there are some intriguing Cold War overtones within the novel.  Matheson's vampires seem to have elements from Soviet Russia: they are brutal and coarse, but not necessarily evil, just different.  Matheson seems to be arguing that the root of the Cold War (the brutality of the Soviet system acknowledged and aside) doesn't stem from competing ambitions but from inherently conflicted world views.  That's not entirely true, but when one considers that \\"I Am Legend\\" was written in the 1950's that view seems oddly dead on.<br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is a superb, albeit unconventional, vampire novel.  It is also an intriguing work of apocalyptic fiction.  Above all though, it is an examination of the nature of being different, and the fragility of the human psyche.is also an intriguing work of apocalyptic fiction.

B000002L9J|5.0|The Smiths are my favorite band even though I listen mostly to Old Schol Punk. This is truly remarkable, some songs are really sad like &quot;There Is A Light That Never Goes Out&quot; that I admit made me cry during hard depressing times in my teen life. If you are barely geting into The Smiths then you should buy either this album or &quot;Singles&quot; so you can hear all of there top good songs. Too bad I dropped and scratched this cd and now I cant hear two songs. But luckly those two songs are on the &quot;Singles&quot; cd which I have.
B00005JKOV|5.0|Linklater's \\"Waking Life\\" begins very simply, with a young girl and boy playing with what Linklater describes in his commentary track as a \\"cootie catcher\\" or \\"fortune teller,\\" which reveals one of the basic principles of the film: 'Dream is Destiny.' From there, the film becomes much heavier and the dialogue becomes much more thick, like a shrouding fog - forget the popcorn, bring the longest attention span you can muster - but it all branches from the same basic principle: That our dreams provide more than just an escape as we stumble our way through life.<br />Two theatrical films tackled such a weighty subject last year - the other, Cameron Crowe's \\"Vanilla Sky,\\" works, but not as well as \\"Abre los Ojos\\", the Spanish film upon which it is based - and while Tom Cruise managed to take the idea to the masses (and to blockbuster status), it is clearly Linklater's film which emerges victorious. The characters are rich, vibrant, and believable, and the vignette presentation makes it possible for the film not to run away from itself; by breaking it down into little segments with countless different faces, we are able to process the information we are receiving much more fluidly.<br />The concept is a well-conceived one. The story may have fallen flat on a live action film, and the animation may have been viewed as cumbersome on a different project, but married together, they create a different and believeable reality, a universe that we, the audience, are allowed to inhabit for our 100 minutes.<br />Linklater says that the film in many ways is a brother to \\"Slacker.\\" I disagree, for while that film felt contrived and odd, \\"Waking Life\\" succeeds at every avenue and makes me excited about the current state of moviemaking. We can only dream that more filmmakers choose to make projects as fascinating as this... and, after all, dream is destiny.
B000066F6H|4.0|Finally, music is getting back to what it should be - full-on rock and roll! This apparent from The Hives' latest disc, Veni Vidi Vicious. These guys kick serious..., especially on Die, All Right!, Main Offender, and Hate To Say I Told You So, which has the catchy opening guitar riff that all great rock songs seem to have. This album is vicious and a whole lotta fun from start to finish. Hopefully it's also a harbinger of the real punk rock's return...

B00005QIPH|5.0|No matter what the lamebrains say, The Strokes are a BIG part of of rock's future. This album's got both punk rock punch in songs such as The Modern Age, Take It Or Leave It, and Barely Legal. It also has both nonchalant and genius lyrical style, most notably on Last Night, Soma, and the title track. Long live The Strokes, the future of rock!
0312265859|4.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out! I read it in one night and really enjoyed it. This is a much superior book to Seven Up, which had too many \\"Lucy & Ethel\\"-type adventures. This is a more well-rounded book, with lots of laughs and some scary parts too. I was glad to see Joe re-enter Stephanie's life, as I think they're a cute couple (no matter how hot Ranger is!). If you're a fan of the Stephanie Plum series, don't miss Hard Eight.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I have played all the games in the RE series (even the crappy Game Boy one) So I kinda knew the basics of the Resident Evil world. This movie is a prequel to the first RE game, showing how the virus infected Racoon City. Pretty good story, and special effects, but the acting and camera work could be better.<br />For the life of me can't see how they got the microphone in so many scenes in this film, every other shot you see the damn thing hanging over the actor's heads.<br />If you liked the RE video games, you'll like this movie more then most. And you'll get the little \\"hints\\" that people who haven't played the game won't, like \\"I want him in the Nemisis Project\\". Someone who plays the RE games knows the \\"Nemisis\\" is the main bad guy from RE3 on the Playstation. But as a zombie movie, it is ok, nothing special.
6305897786|4.0|I like this movie.  Others have said it was a bad movie, but I really enjoy it.<br />It has this neat, creepy atmosphere with a haunting music score.<br />I like the sets, the soundtrack, and the basic plot.  And I think the actors play their characters very effectively.  Maybe some viewers didn't like the characters, but I think they were well played.<br />It seems to move slowly but somehow not in a bad way.  If the movie were accelerated / placed on steroids it would lose the unique atmosphere and become just another action thriller like so many others.<br />And I like the ambiguity in the story.  It adds mystery and leaves some elements up to the imagination of the viewer.  Which fits well with the storyline since its better to leave the details of things like heaven, hell, God, Satan, the afterlife, up to the viewers on concepts.<br />Anyway, I recommend this movie.  I thought it was unique.
0920668372|4.0|This book was given to me by my mother when I had a house-full of 4 children under the age of 4.  I was busy, and set it aside for a day or two, until she said, \\" Read the book today, then call me.\\"  I read it, called her, and was told that she had terminal lung cancer.  This book was the only way my mother could tell me how she felt about me.  She was never one to be open about her feelings, and I honestly cannot remember her telling me she loved me, until the last 6 months of her life.  By then I was over 35, and she started with this book.<BR>I would recommend this book for any age, any gender.  The love it speaks of is one we all need to remember, and share with those close to us, even if we have to do it by sharing this book.<BR>Yes, there are a couple of extremes...climbing in her grown son's window?....but the message is one of importance.

0792839730|5.0|This movie, starring - among others - Sean Connery, Micheal Caine, Elliot Gould, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Sir Anthony Hopkins and Edward Fox, tells the story of Operation MARKET GARDEN, the largest airborne operation in history. The aim of this operation was to seize a number of bridgeheads across the Rhine, and other rivers, through Holland, so as to allow the Allies to drive into the centre of Germany's industrial heartland, the Ruhr. <br />Field Marshall Sir Bernard Montgomery, famous as the commander of the British 8th Army in North Africa and Italy, devised the plan to use airborne troops to 'Lay a carpet across which XXX Corps (an armour and infantry column) can pass\\".<br />The movie provides very accurate depictions of the prelude to the operation, and it's conduct. It clearly shows the failures on the part of Allied commanders and gives graphic vision of the type of street fighting the soldiers of the British 1ST Airborne Division endured in the city of Arnhem. It is in fact the bridge at Arnhem that gives the movie - and the Cornelius Ryan book it is based upon - it's title. <br />For the soldiers of the 1st Airborne (British) - heroism showed no bounds. To have held their location for 9 days against overwhelming odds was nothing short of miraculous. The efforts of the US 82nd and 101st airborne divisions also get the credit they deserve - particularly the daylight crossing of the Rhine by the 82nd Airborne, under the guns of General Wilhelm Bittrichs Panzers.<br />This movie tells the truth about a military disaster of the worst kind. It's author, Montgomery, described the operation as '90% Successful'. Prince Bernard of the Netherlands said \\"My country can ill-afford another of Montgomery's successes\\". <br />An outstanding cast give fine performances in what is easily one of the top 5 war movies of all time
0440219078|4.0|If you are looking for a book that really makes you think and consider the ways of life, this is it. This book can change your outlook on living! The description in this book is simply amazing- Lowry does an incredible job as she describes all of the scenes that Jonas (the main character) experiences. Although the beginning is a bit confusing, once you get into in you're sure to love it. The ending was a bit disappointing to me and i felt that there was not enough closure, but I suggest you read it and decide for yourself!
B000060P79|5.0|this cd is awsome. i recommend this cd to everyone. if you already have this cd you can agree with me on how good it is. and if you don't have it, go out and buy it. i have just recently become a simple plan fan after i saw the movie &quot;the new guy&quot; (they are on the soundtrack for the song &quot;i'm just a kid&quot;). anyway, i love every song on the album and i have become an even bigger fan. so you should go get the simple plan cd &quot;no pads, no helmets...just balls&quot;.
0385484518|4.0|This amazing book, a true story, is about a wonderfully unique relationship between a young man and an old teacher. Mitch, (younger man + author) writes of the lessons he learned long after his favorite teacher had retired. Not only does he learn about himself as well as his teacher and friend, Morrie, but he learns some of life's most important lessons. This book personally helped me come to grips with my fear of death-- Morrie beautifully tells that once you learn how to die, you learn how to live. So true... and this wonderful story is a must read. Although a little dull at times, the message is absolutely one that you must learn at some point in life.
B00005Q3TZ|3.0|I give it 3 stars. 1 for the packaging of this dvd, 1 for the bombing scene and 1 for the dvd content.  As for the story, it is really very boring. It tries very hard to be like titanic but failed big time. I feel that this show has no re-watch value but this dvd is great for collecting if you are into the extras in the dvd.
0066620996|5.0|This book is easy to read and well researched. There is much to glean from its many words of business wisdom, which should be taken as a general guide to good business practices that ensure great, not just good success. <br />Having worked for many years in high-tech companies, I particularly agree with the authors that several factors can be detrimental to attaining greatness. They are: Excessive restructuring and reorganizing, retaining egotistical, bombastic CEO's, a culture of promoting the ignorant, yet visually appealing managers etc. However, it is very true that placing the right, i.e. knowledgeable and disciplined people in the right positions is of utomost importance. These conclusions hit the nail on the head!<br />If you would like to read about these wise findings in a different light, such as the warning signals of imminent failure, and have a good laugh at the same time, then I would also highly recommend the business/humor/satire, MANAGEMENT BY VICE by C.B. Don. In it you shall see some real-life examples of how a good company can undermine its successes and stumble on the road to greatness with rotten management practices, a self-serving CEO, desperate reorganizations...do read the &quot;Reorganization Pill&quot; and &quot;Power Look&quot;...and many more such exposes. Once I had read both these books, I personally felt I had a superbly well-rounded perspective on how a company can soar from good to great and what pitfalls to watch out for!

I recently became a Linda Howard fan after reading Open Season (which I also highly recommend) and after reading this book I know I am hooked.<BR>Mr. Perfect is very sensual, and very sexy, yet for those out there like me who enjoy a good mystery this book definitely has this. I couldn't put it down it was so exciting! Mr. Perfect will keep you guessing until the very end and it will leave you wanting to read more of Linda Howard's books!!
B00006690F|3.0|The problem with this CD is unlike some of eminem's previous music this cd lacks any real substance.  The lyrics dont touch upon any worthwhile issues.  Lyrics aside, eminem is still fairly talented at rap(but obviously not at the level of 2pac snoop or biggie) and thats why i give this cd 3 stars.
B000001IQH|5.0|This is true punk here. Highly recomended for anyone just getting into punk music.  I personally like Lars better than Tim so this CD in my opinion is better because Lars does more singing.  Full of energy and even a hint of ska.  Great CD for the punk fan.  Also check out Let's Go and the New self titled one. Those are great too.
B00003CXTG|4.0|As being a Movie lover, I think this movie did a good job at trying to bring this actual event to take place.  I love all the effects that make this movie come to life.  As a matter of fact, I wish i was on the set myself helping them film this movie.  The Attack scene was really Intense, and realistic.  The love story that has to go withen the movie was not very believable though.  I think it would have had a greater effect if Eveylen would have felt deeper feelings for both guys.  Which would have made the viewers felt more for what the characters were feeling. I think the movie had enough character development, but poor acting when something dreadful happened withen the love story.  Overall, the movie was great and I appreciate how much work was put in to it.
0679735909|5.0|I read this book a long time ago (maybe four years ago), but I still think it's one of the best books I ever read.  Admittedly, it's a difficult read. (Warning: do not take this book on a road trip or on the beach wih you!)  Byatt has an incredibly poetic writing style (and actually wrote considerable amounts of poetry for this book).  I think the language alone is worth the 'work' of reading this book, but she manages to combine her linguistic finesse with a compelling story. I would liken this book to Doctor Zhivago: a great love story crossing historical boundaries, with lots of poetry. I can see how it's not for everyone though. If you don't have patience for long descriptive passages, no matter how beautifully written, then don't waste your time or money on this one.
6305910340|5.0|A heart-warming, feel good movie that introduces you to Josh Waitskin (Max Pomeranc), a 7-year-old chess enthusiast. Not only is he enthusiastic, he is a brilliant player that uses combinations that only the most advanced players would dare to try. The best part is Josh is just an everyday kid with a good heart. He has never been schooled in the techniques of the advanced rules of competition that accompany the game. Josh lacks the \\"killer instinct\\", and he finds himself up against kids whose lives are warped by their obsession for the game.<br />Ben Kingsley plays the chess teacher hired by his dad to coach him in the ways of this competitive world where many of the moves are based on games played by such greats as Bobby Fischer. Laurence Fishburn's role introduces the flip side of the spectrum, a street player who plays for money in Washington Square, and shoots from the hip. Conflict is bound to ensue when oil meets water and it certainly does.<br />Director Steven Zallian, interlaces live footage of Bobby Fischer's genius which Josh narrates, adding an interesting aspect to the possibilities and incredible vigor behind the competition that these kids are up against. Based on a true story, this was a great movie for the whole family, with life lessons to be learned. I highly recommend it.  Kelsana 6/19/02
B00005AREQ|5.0|Simply awesome CD.  Where should I even begin?  Superb guitar tones by Mister Jeff Beck and Max Middleton compliments very well on the keyboards. And oh what super drumming and bass playing as well.  The oh so many special drum beats just blows me away.<br />And the styles that vary from song to song just flow so effortlessly.  The funk influence on You Know What I Mean and Thelonious just groove my very soul.  Its cool to hear Stevie Wonder's influence on Jeff Becks playing on the later number.<br />And Mr. Beck pays suitabel homage to the Beatles on She's A Woman making this song his own.  Oh what beautiful colorful notes.  And we can not forget the highlights Air Blower and Because We Ended As Lovers.  What beautiful color on the guitar tones on the later piece.  Not to mention the shift in mood from fas to slow on Airblower and the call and answer section between guitar and keyboard.<br />The other songs/pieces are filled with beauty as well.  Who needs a vocalist hear as Jeff Beck and Company certainly let their instruments doing their talking.  A pioneer record that combines elements of rock, jazz, and fusion.  I'm sure the members of Spyra Gyra were influenced by this high quality recording among many other artists as well.  You will be engaged by the wonderful jams and classy hooks.
6305508550|5.0|The best part of this DVD besides the film is the beginning menu. At first I thought something had really gone wrong, then I just started laughing as soon as the main menu came up. The extras are sadly non-existent, but it's still a great movie to own. Maybe one day they'll put out a loaded \\"Office Space\\" DVD. ...
B00004U8P9|5.0|This is a great DVD with great extras! If you like the RHPS, you need this disc. HOWEVER, if you are looking forward to the audience participation section, it's a waste of time. The recording is of a whole room of fans screaming at the screen at the appropriate moments. This is to be expected, but you can't understand a word they're saying because they are all yelling different things at different times. This would have been a great time for an extra subtitle feature or a booklet to prompt the viewer.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Pretty Good Video, but the audio can sure let you down at times, and the fact that we waited a while for this DVD, can't explain why Lucas couldn't of slapped on a DTS track in the first place. I rented this so I could get a dose of the special features and see some deleted scenes, and compare with the full screen video version with the DVD. It's good, and I like to see a wider shot of things.<br />But someone, PLEASE KILL JAR JAR BINKS. He's the reason why this movie doesn't pass for me and why Star Wars Episode I was such a big disappointment. He also ruins the sound quality, and he hurts my eyes, so yeah, you can tell he is pretty annoying. But the DVD passes, not the movie. But the DVD is a disappointment as well, if Lucas made us wait so long, where is the better quality?
0312265859|3.0|having just discovered this series about a week ago I devoured books 1-7 in time for hard eight to come out the other day. I read it in about 3 hours and had mixed feelings when i finished.<BR>I of course was glad to be back in the lives of steph, joe, ranger and grandma mazur, but was left with an empty feeling as if the book never got down and dirty with any of them this time.<BR>I felt as if i was involved in a game of duck duck goose with the characters just tapping each one on the head to know they were there but never claiming anyone of them to be \\"it\\". The ending left us guessing that the next installment will be called<BR>\\"Nine months: whos the papa\\". For all Plum fans read on you will still enjoy as i did....I just felt a bit empty afterwards...
B000066NW0|5.0|This CD rocks because Avril Lavigne is very true and real, and her songs are very easy to relate to. She has a beautiful voice, and writes her own lyrics, which makes them from her heart, and you can hear it too! I would really recommend this CD because Avril Lavigne is not fake and does not show off her belly, and try to act like a sex symbol. She doesnt have to act. She is herslf, she is real.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I finally watched A.I. the other night. It was good, it was bad, and it was ugly, all at the same time.<br />First the good: Visually, this is one of the most fully realized sci-fi movies in a long time, from the retro-future Swinton house, to the post-apocalyptic landscape of the submerged New York. The robots and the über-robots at the end were all beautifully designed. John Williams score was appropriately ethereal and \\"small,\\" instead of the usually \\"big\\" sound he's done for other Spielberg movies. The acting went from excellent to so-so. The usually wooden William Hurt was excellent in his brief appearance as the arrogant robotics expert Dr. Hobby. I wish he had been much more central to the story. Haley Joel Osment was astonishing. I don't think anyone could have pulled off the transformation from robotic child, to near-human feeling robot with such confidence and aplomb. Jude Law was also just a revelation as Gigolo Joe, and quite possibly the most sympathetic character in the whole movie, apart from the animatronic \\"supertoy\\" Teddy, who really stole the movie, as far as I'm concerned. The rest of the cast, from David's \\"adoptive\\" mother and father, to the real kids, to the collection of stereotypes at the \\"Flesh Fair,\\" are just cardboard characters there to service the plot. Which leads me to...<br />The bad: Actually, there is no plot, only a series of barely related events. A.I. purports to be the story of a robotic child, a \\"mecha,\\" named David who has been given the ability to love. He is \\"adopted\\" by a couple whose real son is cryogenically frozen. After some initial hesitation, the mother, Monica, decides to take the risk, and imprints herself on David, activating his \\"love\\" program. Of course, the real son miraculously recovers from his ailment, and things take a bad turn for robot David. An accident at a poolside birthday party causes the family to see David as a threat, and Mom abandons David in the woods, rather than see him destroyed.<br />At first glance, it looks as though we are being treated to a modern-day retelling of the classic legend of the \\"changeling.\\" A changeling is a fairy child that is substituted for a human child by the fairy folk, and who eventually returns to them. But this is far too sophisticated and \\"obscure\\" for director Steven Spielberg, who instead trots out his own personal obsession, the Pinocchio story, literally! David overhears his \\"mommy\\" reading Pinocchio to her real son. So when he finds himself abandoned in the woods, David's literal-minded robot brain decides that if he is to win back his \\"mommy's\\" love, he must find the Blue Fairy of the story and ask her to make him a real boy. David's quest to find the Blue Fairy occupies the rest of the movie. In the end, David does find the Blue Fairy, which now leads us to...<br />The ugly, facile ending, in which Spielberg lays on his patented treacle with a trowel. 2000 years pass after David is trapped underwater in what should have been the movie's more poignant and believeable ending. He is found by highly advanced \\"super-robots\\" that are the sole surviving life-forms on earth after what looks like a second Ice Age has wiped out organic life. David's obsessive wish to win his mother's love is fulfilled, in a deux ex machina of cheap, overdone sentimentality. But then, that is Mr. Spielberg's stock in trade. <br />So, to sum up: This is a beautiful, well photographed, well scored movie, with some truly astonishing special effects and set design. But the story and plot are 15 years too late. Only a little of Stanley Kubrick's and Ian Watson's dark and cynical outline remain, and are eventually overwhelmed by Steven Spielberg's saccharine mentality.
B00000J6AG|1.0|after listening to this album a couple of time, I got so sick of hearing it, it not one of those albums that grows in appreciation the more u listen to it, the only half decent tracks, would b towards the end. i can just say-i',m glad i got it off a friend because it's not worth paying the money for. it blues with a facelift that didn't seem to work out too well.
B000002JS6|5.0|There are a lot of reasons why I should hate AC/DC. I don't usually like simple and repetitive riffs.

You guessed it, I'm one of those eggheads who gets angry when some self-important music critic calls a musician \\"pompous\\" or \\"pretentious\\" just because the said musician tries for something deeper than \\"party till we puke!!!\\" So I should hate AC/DC, right?<br />WRONG. Even though AC/DC is not my favorite band, I will always respect their realness and dedication. Back in Black, if you ask me, is a shining example of not just AC/DC, but of any rock band giving their best during the worst of situations. After lead singer Bon Scott's untimely passing, Brian Johnson now had both the most sought-after and yet most intimidating job in rock and roll - filling Bon's spot. I'm not going to open myself to a debate as to which singer is better, but I'll be darned if Johnson (and every other member of the band) didn't give it everything he had. What could have been a depressing eulogy turned out to be a vibrant celebration with a new torchbearer.<br />Who can forget the sinister \\"Hell's Bells\\"? Or the unbridled lust on \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\", \\"Honey, What Do You Do For Money?\\", or \\"Givin' the Dog a Bone\\"? If you haven't heard the anthemic title track or \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", your local rock radio station *if you are a regular listener* is in desperate need of a format change. Oh, I almost forgot about one of my favorite songs ever  \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\".<br />Although I'm a big fan of progressive rock like Rush, Dream Theater, and King Crimson; Back in Black (along with AC/DC's other albums) captures a unique energy that keeps me coming back, even if I don't really like AC/DC-style rock and roll. That's how universal AC/DC is. And that's coming from a person who hates things that try to be \\"all things to all people.\\" But AC/DC just try to be themselves for themselves, and that's more than enough.all things to all people.\\" But AC/DC just try to be themselves for themselves, and that's more than enough.
0441003257|4.0|Quite possibly the funniest account of the Apocalypse ever written. If you can buy into the idea that the Spawn of Satan gets mixed up in a baby-switching caper, that the Four Horsepersons of the Apocalypse are not only alive and well, but among other capers marketing their own diet foods, and that the outcome of the eternal struggle between Good and Evil boils down to an angel and a devil who have more in common than they have different (including an appreciation of the good restaurants in London's West End) - then this book's for you.<br />I have owned three copies of \\"Good Omens\\" up until now, and I have always passed them on, with the stipulation that the recipient do the same when they finished it. It's that sort of book- if it resonates with you, you'll want everyone you know to read it. If it doesn't, give it to somebody else just to get rid of it. Either way, you'll be doing somebody a favor.
B000002H6C|5.0|After 1986's \\"Master of Puppets\\", the album which many consider Metallica's finest, not to mention one of the greatest metal/thrash albums of all time (personally I thought \\"Ride the Lightning\\" was better), Metallica found themselves without a bassist (Cliff Burton was tragically killed) and needed a new sense of direction.  Jason Newsted was recruited, and with all the rage and hate the band had felt, they used it to form \\"...And Justice For All\\".  Its a pity though, the production is shoddy, I mean you can't even hear Newsted's bass at all.  Other than that, this is a fantastic piece of heavy metal.  The opening \\"Blackened\\", which Newsted helped write, tells of Earth being decimated, and its heavy melody carries the song.  The nine plus minute epic title track begins with an acoustic intro, followed by some of Lars Ulrich's best drumming ever, and the song tells about how corrupt the justice system is, and pronounces the death of the American dream.  \\"Shortest Straw\\" is the only weakpoint on the album, this is where the shoddy production really hits hard.  But that is all forgiven once the all time classic \\"One\\" kicks in.  From the moment you hear the hellicopter and the explosions and yells of soldiers, you know your going to hear something special.  \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" and \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" are great as well, but the nearly ten minute instrumental epic \\"To Live is to Die\\" is a touching tribute to Cliff Burton, now this is musicianship when you can hear the emotion in the music, not the lyrics.  \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" is another all time classic, with a memorable beginning riff, and a great, if repetitive, chorus that became one of Metallica's concert staples for years.  Album closer \\"Dyers Eve\\" is a shockingly violent song with James Hetfield nearly screaming his disdain towards his parents, and it is only electrified by Kirk Hammet's blazing solo, which helps the song remain one of my all time favorite Metallica songs.  All in all, \\"...And Justice For All\\" is a great album, and if it were not for the shoddy production, probably would have been Metallica's finest hour.  Funny though, considering how frenzied and socially disdained this album is, their self titled follow up was more mainstream aimed and helped catapault Metallica to godlike status (in some people's eyes anyway).l\\" is a great album, and if it were not for the shoddy production, probably would have been Metallica's finest hour.

B00003CX9E|5.0|think of every aspect about how a movie is made (you know this i don't need to point it out to you) this film far supercedes anything that was made before and after. name one movie that can even come close the pure mixture of visual audacity, musical composition, framing, acting, writing, costume, set, editing. i could go on but you get the idea. it's a film that has the right balance of all of it. not too lacking in any department.
B00004Z459|1.0|Can you say Faith No More?  Or Biohazard?  They were two of the bands who pioneered combining rap music with heavy metal, while they mixed it with a meaningful message (in Biohazard's case, it was a political agenda).  Now enter Linkin Park, one of the more recent bands that it seems everyone is jumping on.  First off, nearly every song sounds the exact same, not to mention it sounds like there is virtually no thought process to writing music; the same old downtuned guitars on every track.  Not to mention repetitive choruses, contradictory lyrics, and the same harmonies on every song as well.  Chester Bennington has an interesting voice however, and he could do a lot better than with this band or this music.  This is nothing more than Faith No More for the new generation with downtuned guitars, inconsistent drumming, and annoying rapping.  Do yourself a favor, check out Faith No More or Biohazard, they're the real deal.
B00005OAIE|5.0|It's obvious those who dislike John's Creative talent have apparently been brainwashed by the mass marketing of musical clones. <br />Room For Squares is a Must have for anyone who appreciates Music with thought behind it rather than profit margins. <br />His slightly rock but melodic style, is a new breed of music.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Sam Raimi's crafted one of the finest horror films of all time with the original Evil Dead, which became a landmark film for the horror genre.  First off you can tell the film is low budget, but that didn't stop Raimi from crafting a wild, shocking, well rounded movie that created an entire cult legacy.  In case you don't know the story by now, five college students go on vacation at an abandoned cabin, only to find the Necronomicon and inadvertantly release some very evil spirits that takes over each person one by one until only our reluctant hero Ash (Bruce Campbell) is left.  What follows is a wildly entertaining horror thrillride that pulls out as many stops as Raimi can handle behind the helm with the claustrophobic, eerie atmosphere of the cabin and the surrounding, living forest, and some greatly disorienting and dizzying camera angles.  The makeup effects team used the small budget as best they could to create some great blood and gore effects (I still can't get the image of one of the girls knawing her hand off), and Bruce Campbell is equally great in his defining role, although he would not be the slapstick ridden hapless hero of the later films Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.  All in all, if you want to watch a real horror movie thats budget didn't strap its' imagination, then there isn't a better time then now to get this new special edition of Evil Dead.  Plus, the Book of the Dead casing is fantasticly designed.
B000002OZY|5.0|In 1969 the Who were still trying to make it as a big band but were having some difficulty.  Sure they had hits like \\"My Generation\\", \\"I Can See For Miles\\" and \\"Magic Bus\\".  However those singles came and went and the Who seemed rather lost by 1969.  That is until they released Tommy.  The classic spawned several hits as well as being famous for the first ever \\"rock opera\\".  This masterpiece brought the Who back into the musical spotlight.<br />The album opens up with OVERTURE which summarizes the musical score somewhat.  IT'S A BOY starts off the rather bizarre tale of Tommy and it proceeds into 1921.  THE AMAZING JOURNEY is a good listen and SPARKS has some great guitar.  EYESIGHT TO THE BLIND (THE HAWKER) is a classic as well as CHRISTMAS.  COUSIN KEVIN is a great tune and THE ACID QUEEN is definetly one of the albums highlights.  UNDERTURE is another instrumental.  DO YOU THINK HE'S ALRIGHT? proceeds into the quirky FIDDLE ABOUT followed by PINBALL WIZARD one of the biggest hits on the album.  THERE'S A DOCTOR/ GO TO THE MIRROR is one of the albums underrated classics that is truly awesome. TOMMY CAN YOU HEAR ME? is a short acoustic ditty.  SMASH THE MIRROR is a brief piece of great rock 'n roll.  SENSATION is a nice tune.   MIRACLE CURE is nothing really except a lame cheer.  SALLY SIMPSON is a classic.  I'M FREE was a big hit.  WELCOME is another underrated classic.  TOMMY'S HOLIDAY CAMP is a lame ditty but the album closes with the brilliant WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE IT which features the famous \\"SEE ME, FEEL ME, TOUCH ME, HEAL ME\\" line.<br />Tommy is arguably The Who's best album.  It truly took the Who from a promising Garage band to rock 'n roll icons.  More success would follow  with 'Who's Next' in 1971.  This proved that the Who's new found brilliance was for real.<br />Bottom line: Tommy is a classic!  One of the best albums of 1969.  My hats off to Pete Townshend for his musical genius.  If you want to get into the Who this is a great place to start.  Truly a most for all Who fans!  Highly recommended!
B000000Y2F|5.0|This 1958 item may seem a bit short by today's CD standards, but don't let that stop you from buying it. Listen with total attention for the 38 minutes and you'll learn why J. Coltrane and T. Monk were geniuses. Coltrane plays tenor sax on four of the six cuts, and each was written by Monk. The magic and the mathematics and the mysticism which together make up the word &quot;music&quot; are each in evidence. What these guys get out of their instruments, or more accurately perhaps, what they put into them, has to be heard to be believed. This collection simultaneously chases away your worries and peps you up. It is beautiful and complex but accessible and happy. If you love jazz, buy it. If you are afraid of jazz, buy it. Great, great,great.
B000002H92|5.0|The Doors have always been famous for their concert performances and Jim Morrison has always been notorious for his antics during these live performances.  However 1991's In Concert compilation is obviously one of the bands tamer nights as Morrison does not not sound too drunk during the performances.  Does this mean that this live compilation is boring.  Hell no!  In Concert contains some of the bands most electric performances ever!<br />Disc One is basically a reissue of the Doors famous live album ABSOLUTLEY LIVE (released in 1970).  The concert is quite good as it features an opening blues classic WHO DO YOU LOVE.  The medley of ALABAMA SONG, BACKDOOR MAN, LOVE HIDES, and FIVE TO ONE is awesome.  Some of these songs surpass the studio versions.  BUILD ME A WOMAN is okay.  WHEN THE MUSIC OVER is one of the cd's lengthly tracks where Morrsion does great improvising.  UNIVERSAL MIND is outstanding.  PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER is the interlude to the awesome medley of DEAD CATS DEAD RATS/ BREAK ON THROUGH # 2.  I always wanted the Doors to record a studio version of BREAK ON THROUGH # 2 it was so more effective than the original 2 minute version.  The true highlight here is THE CELEBRATION OF THE LIZARD.  This performance of Morrison's notorious lyrical poem is very haunting.  The final track in a nice seven minute long version of SOUL KITCHEN which raps up things nicely.<br />Disc 2 is far more disjointed as it comes from several different concerts.  The songs are excellent on their own but Disc 2 lacks the In concert feel of Disc 1.  None the less the live version of ROADHOUSE BLUES opens Disc 2 with a bang.  GLORIA is another undiscovered gem but I can see why Elektra never allowed the Doors to put this on one of their albums.  Pretty risque!  LIGHT MY FIRE is okay but it lacks the energy that the original posesses.  YOU MAKE ME REAL is just as good or better as the studio version.  I don't see why they bothered to include TEXAS RADIO AND THE BIG BEAT here asit is incomplete and pointless.  LOVE ME TWO TIMES is another gem that sounds wonderful live.  LITTLE RED ROOSTER features John Sebastian on harmonica.  MOONLIGHT DRIVE is a stellar performance.<BR>CLOSE TO YOU features Ray Manzerek on lead vocals for a very bluesy feeling song.  THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER is another classic.  And finally THE END closes the Disc 2 with Morrison doing his wild improvisations again.<br />Although there are some points where the recordings may sound utterly messy and uneven.  In Concert is a wonderful live performance none the less.  I'm sure the Doors have put on better concerts than this however if you want to hear these guys live this is just what the doctor ordered.  It is a wonderful compilation.  Let's hope to see more Doors live recordings in the future.<br />Overall The Doors In Concert is a must for all Doors fans.  Both disc 1 and disc 2 are fantastic.  You really have not heard the Doors until you have heard BREAK ON THROUGH # 2 and FIVE TO ONE live.  This is an awesome double cd set.  Highly recommended!
B000000Y27|4.0|This was Montgomery's second record, and the early 1960 sessions with the great backing of pianist Tommy Flanagan, Percy Heath on bass (of Modern Jazz Quartet fame) and Albert Heath on drums made him famous.Unusual in that the album features four original songs, two by other jazz greats and only two &quot;pop standards&quot;, this disc rewards attentive listening with the earphones before throwing it on the living room player as background. I've liked jazz guitar ever since Wes got his career started, and the newer guys I've heard like Pat Methany and John Scofield simply don't hold my interest as well as Wes does.
B0000524CY|5.0|this is not one of the best.    it is the best. the best horror movie ever made. and i have to say one thing to you people out there that is reading this. the scene where she spits the pea soup in the priest's face. in that whole scene you can see a tube coming out of her nose. the tube is going up her nose into her mouth. in other words the tube is all connected. the pea soup runs up the tube into her mouth so this way she can spit it out of her mouth. and if you don't believe me than how come there is no tube in the rest of the scenes.
6303824382|5.0|This movie is just as good as the first one. This movie starts out where the police get a call from a man that speaks with a german accent asking for a McClane. When they find him he is sent to the hood with a sign that is not very nice with the help of samuel jackson he escapes the hood. The FBI found out that the man calling himself simon came out to be Oberst (colonel) Kreig, but they found out that he was born Simon Gruber. With the help of the hungarian army expert Matthias Targo he sets off more bombs if McClane does not comply. it turns out the whole thing is a heist for Gold at the reserve. Watch Bruce Willis survive simon's riddles. At the end of this review just ask your self. What has 2 legs and is ready to blow something up. Veil Gluck.

B00005JKDQ|5.0|...While monsters in the closet may seem to be a scary reality for some children, `Monsters, Inc.' makes it light hearted by showing them it's all in a night's work. The characters are as charming as the cast that speaks for them.<br />It's a learning experience children get to see how an industry works. Monsters, Inc. is an in-genius corporation that has scientifically learned how to channel children's screams into energy that is used for electrical power. It has monster employees, an assembly line of doors (which give monsters access to children's bedrooms), a top-flight training program and some of the top Monsters in the scaring business.<br />There's a colorful Metropolis, filled with houses, buildings, businesses, cars and everything that makes a city run smoothly along with a population of colorful creatures. One of the colorful groups of creatures is the yellow swat team. Their job is to protect the Metropolis of Monsters, Inc. from human contamination.<br />But what happens when a human child mysteriously gets through the bedroom door and terrorizes the city with screams and boo's. It's wondrous and funny. In the mist of all this is industrial crime, brought on by greed. But, the story ends on a very happy note.<br />John Goodman is the voice of `Sulley' a colorful large blue-green ape like monster who's the star Monsters, Inc. employee. He's some type of monster, cut, cuddly, and he has a conscience that leads him to feelings of regret about scarring children. He becomes attached to Boo (voice of Mary Gibbs) a cute, little big-eyed girl who is mysteriously brought to Monsters, Inc. and in his quest to return her home becomes very attached to her.<br />Sulley's best friend is Mike (voice of Billy Crystal) who's a funny looking green ball with stick legs and one huge eye. His comedy is seen through out the movie. Mike is Sulley's driving force, acting as his agent. Mike's job is to make sure Sulley remains the top Monsters, Inc. employee. But when it comes to laughter Mike proves he's on top.<br />Mike's girl friend Celia (voice of Jennifer Tilley) is the stylish employee who has Mike's best interest at heart. Her job is to keep him out of trouble.<br />I give Monsters, Inc. a ten. It is an animated movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family. It makes for great family fun. I also loved the hilarious outtakes with of course, Roz.<br />My Rating ****1/2
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is destined to be one of the all time great science fiction movies and can be placed in the same class that 2001: A Space Odyssey is in.  When I first saw this movie, I had no preconceived notions of what I was about to witness and was not even expecting to enjoy myself, but I received a ver pleasant surprise.  This is a well conceived, evenly paced, and brilliantly acted movie portraying a not too distant future.  While the sets and characters are obviously very stylized, I could not help but think about how much of this movie's depiction of the future could be possible.<br />  While a science fiction movie with vision of the future powerful enough to make one think - at it's core, the movie is a story about determination, heart, and mankinds overwhelming urge to succeed regardless of the odds.  In some ways, I was reminded of the movie Rocky, as both films depict individuals who overcome insurmountable odds and their lack of advantages in order to obtain a goal that is viewed as impossible.<br />  As for the DVD - it is terrific also.  The video and sound quality is excellent being presented in anamorphic 2.35:1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 respectively.  There isn't an overwhelming collection of extras provided but the featurette and the deleted scenes are nice and provide insight into the making of the film.<br />All in all - Well done!  I would recommend this movie to anyone, and do so frequently.
B000004286|5.0|First of all, I'd like to congradulate Mr. Horner for his efforts with this score and thank him for sharing his talents with us for more than 20 years.<br />This score is excellent.  Even if you can hear a bit of Glory here and there, it is still one of the best he has ever composed.  You can tell he put a lot of emotion into this one.  The bagpipes and other Celtic instruments fit in very nicely and the Lonodon Symphony Orchestra is absolutely fabulous, as always.  Although it doesn't say it on the front cover or on the cd itself, Mr. Horner actually did all of the orchestrations himself (he usually has someone help him with that, or in some cases hands it over to someone else entirely), and played the keyboard solos.  This is an excellent score that fits in perfectly with an excellent film by Mel Gibson.  <br />I can (and I hope you will be able to) tell why people consider this one of the best scores ever made.  It is certainly one of my personal favorites.  <br />The cd itself is long (over 77 minutes), and I LOVE that (man, how I wish Glory was 77 minutes long)!  It's always good to know you're getting your money's worth when you pop a cd into your player and the total time comes up as over an hour (though most people, myself included, would buy it if it was only 45 minutes)... <br />The only thing I will complain about is that the score itself sounds a little too subdued and docile for my tastes (I won't sink so low as to take off any stars, this is still an excellent score, even if it's not exactly what I want).  The battle scenes could have gone into some more exciting pieces, and could have been louder, but they weren't.  Also, there were were only like 2 or 3 big crescendos (don't make fun of me!  I like my crescendos!!!) in the main theme and/or other parts, but Horner's use of strings to convey emotional parts (another favorite of mine) satisfies me enough that I don't care that much...
B00005RY7X|5.0|First and foremost.. Andrew - We love your attitude... and your hair!<br />Personally I find W.K's album \\"I Get Wet\\" to be a fun alternative to the everyday in music land. If you have not listened to this album I suggest it (do it simply for the cultural experience) and listen to it twice (the second listen may be necessary in order to appreciate what is being said.) At this price the CD is a steal. Purchase this album and be the one to introduce it to your friends.<br />In my world of Radiohead, Blind Melon and SOAD; this hard core, senseless, head smashing - beer bashing party music is an excellent break from lyrics that (although kick @ss) often take an effort and can sometimes leave you feeling worn out or depressed. Sometimes I don't want to think about politics or crime. Sometimes I don't want to think at all. And it is at these times that I truly celebrate Andrew W. K. 'You can't stop what you can't end.'
B00005R23S|5.0|When I reviewed the &quot;Live in New York City&quot; CD, I ended by suggesting it might be a good idea to wait for the DVD.  I was right.<br />Everything about the CD pointed to a rushed release; poor song sequencing, mediocre sound, questionable song selection and inexcusable packaging.  With the lack of crowd noise coming through the mix, it lost the excitement we all associate with Bruce's concerts.  As I had hoped, the DVD brings this excitement back.<br />While we all might have preferred a slightly different song list, overall the selection works well.  The sequencing, which bothered many reviewers on the CD, seems to work better here -- obviously aided by the video.  While I would have preferred a few more &quot;extras&quot; -- more interview time with the band, backstage shots, etc. -- the NYC Serenade segment is okay.<br />Technically, the DVD is very well produced.  The video transfer is outstanding.  Some of the close-up shots are amazingly crisp on my widescreen.  The 5.1 surround mix brings you right into the crowd.  They even mixed in a little sound delay/echo in the rear channel to mirror typical stadium sound -- a subtle touch that really works well.<br />They say a picture is worth a thousand words.  That sure rings true here.  Where the CD was less effective than many bootlegs at capturing the excitement of a Springsteen/E Street Band concert, the DVD was actually more satisfying than when I saw them when they passed through Chicago on this tour. (This is undoubtedly due to the fact that I was in the nosebleed section of the United Center, which offers the worst sound of any venue I've ever been to.)<br />Buy this DVD.  It will help you through the long droughts we have to endure between Bruce's tours.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril may claim herself a punk at heart but her music is far from that. The punkiest song here, Sk8er Boi, is still miles away from a punk song.<br /><br />Don't be mistaken. The album is a rather listenable pop album with songs like Naked. The girl sings and writes, but her age really reveals the sometimes awkward lyrics despite the soaring vocals and good melodies. Inevitably, she draws comparison with another angst-ridden mistress Alanis Morissette and even labelmate Pink.<br /><br />The road is long, and Avril may need a little more time to prove her place in the music world. However, too much of intervention on the record company's part results in another manufactured pop artist.

B00005OAIE|1.0|All the lyrics are trite self-involved forms of consolation that don't seperate him much from a studio musician or lyricist. I've been moved more by Disney soundtracks. He lacks any passion and everything recorded sounds like somebody  held a gun to his head and forced him to write this album. Not much seperates him from Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand except his consistent mediocrity.<br />Seriously, the only people that would be upset by this review are the ones that confuse physical attraction with musical talent.  If he had the latter, we'd be hearing much more about his sophomore album. <br />If you like his hit single, I'd recommend listening to Ben Lee or Promise Ring.

B00000IBRI|4.0|Dario Argento is a brilliant filmmaker whose well of creativity is seemingly bottomless. Phenomena is a spooky tale of a young girl (Jennifer Connelly) who moves into a boarding house while a serial killer is on the loose. The daughter of a famous actor, Jennifer's character has a hard time fitting in with the other girls, especially after the other girls find out she sleep-walks, witnesses murders in her dreams, and communicates with insects. The movie plays like IT'S a dream and Argento uses his camera to increase this illusion. The murder scenes are done from the perspective of the killer so all you see of the murderer is a hand wearing a black glove. It's a good movie, but not Argento's best (I liked Opera & Tenebre better), which is why I gave it four stars. See it for some original scares.

6305313687|5.0|This film is a master piece! I will not pretend to say that i don't have any racist feelings because i do. So i had mixed feelings while seeing this film. Part of me was going \\"ya!\\" and part of me was ashamed.We will always have hatred in america. Those who say they do not hate are phonys. I do have hate but seeing this film it gives hate a place to put that hate on a shelf. You WILL learn from this film and that is exactly the message that this film has. We are here on earth to learn and this movie is a wonderful example of how to learn to control and understand the people we fear. Give this film a change, you will learn alot about people and about yourself. As far as the acting? Hats off to Ed Norton! He's a rare Hollywood talent who has all my respect. He knows his craft and is excellent at it. The supporting cast is also equally as good. This is a very powerful movie and hope that it is listed as a very important film in the 20th/21st Century.

B00004ZELJ|5.0|I fist seen this concert on Pay Per View and I was so stoked.  The boys did songs that us Americans never got to hear on cds.  It was energentic and full of groovy dance moves.  Each boy did they're own solo and got the crowd pumped in their own way.  Howie did a romantic \\"My Heart Stays With You\\" as he threw white roses out to various girls in the audience.  AJ did a sexy sexy song \\"Lay Down Beside Me\\" while grinding on the stage.  Kevin got the crowd pumped up with \\"Nobody Like You\\" as he danced wildly around the stage.  Brian relaxed the crowd a bit with \\"That's What She Said\\".  And Nicky did a very sultry version of \\"I Need You Tonight\\", and interrupted it with \\"Let's Have a Party\\" which made the crowd go wild.  Many kewl costume changes accompany this dvd.  This is a must for any BSB fan.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Between the angry rap and sugary pop currently played on most radio stations in the US, John Mayer's &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is a breath of fresh air.  He captures the young adulthood longing for his own identity on &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, and I expect to hear &quot;Neon&quot; as the next single any day.  This young man's (note: he is still young and will only continue to grow as an artist)debut album has given me so much hope for the future of popular music.  I was beginning to think that pop music was bereft of soul!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's been around for only about a year and a half, yet, they have a history bands like Limp Bizkit achieved in 5 years: their debut album went 8 times platinum, they've hosted 5 different shows on MTV, 1 on VH1, 1 on HBO (I think), and more, they were nonimated for 3 Grammys and went home with 1, they played 314 shows in the year 2001, almost 1 a day (according to Rolling Stone Magazine), they toured on Ozzfest and Family Values, both in one year, and even created their own tour, the Projekt Revolution tour, with Adema and Cypress Hill. And they're still going. Now on to the Hybrid Theory album. This has to be the best thing I have ever heard. And this is about Phoenix, their bass player; if you didn't already know, Phoenix wasn't in this album because at the time, he was completing a promise he made to another band, which was to tour with them for a year. The bands name is The Snax, and as soon as he finished his year, he rejoined Linkin Park.I'll now review the songs:<br />1.Papercut-5/5-The first track, and a great song. Very eerie, and it just plain rocks. Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one.<BR>2.One Step Closer-3/5-You HAVE heard it, so I won't review it. I gave it a 3 because of all the times I've heard it. Chester Bennington mainly sings this one.<BR>3.With You-4/5-This song has a unique sound. It's the most electronic song on the album, probably because it also has The Dust Brothers on it. It's mainly rap, but like \\"Papercut\\", the choruses and the bridge are hard... rock! Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one.<BR>4.Ponts of Authority-5/5-The best song on the album. You can party to this one. The intro is so awesome. Chester Bennington mainly sings this one.<BR>5.Crawling-4/5-Like \\"One Step Closer\\", I'm sure you've heard this, so I won't review it. Chester Bennington mainly sings this one.<BR>6.Runaway-5/5-This is a different song, and I can't really describe it. Just look around on one of the other 1,000 reviews. Chester Bennington mainly sings this one.<BR>7.By Myself-4/5-The intro's really hard, possibly the hardest part of the whole album, and then it goes into rap, then the rock chorus, and so on, and so on, and... Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one.<BR>8.In The End-5/5-YES! YOU'VE HEARD IT! NO REVIEW! Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one. But, Chester Bennington sings a hell of a lot, too.<BR>9.A Place for My Head-5/5-The beginning guitar sounds like it's Spanish, dosen't it?...Oh, yeah. This is one of the best songs. Mike Shinoda raps all fast and stuff all the way through. His best song on the album. Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one.<BR>10.Forgotten-3/5-The choruses are awesome, but the verses take away from it. Otherwise, it's a great song. Mike Shinoda mainly sings this one.<BR>11.Cure For the Itch-5/5-You either love this song... or youn hate it. I love it. I don't care for rap (actully I...HATE it), but this song is really cool. It's just a DJ song, in case y'all didn't know.<BR>12.Pushing Me Away-5/5-The softest song on the album, and Chester sings the best on it. The first time you hear it, it makes you want to cry, and even after you've listened to it a million times, it is still awesome. Chester Bennington mainly sings this one.<br />Linkin Park is one of those bands that you will never forget, that is, if you like them. The musicians are extremely talented. Rob Bourdon (Drums) shines the best on \\"In the End\\", \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Pushing Me Away\\". Joe Hahn (Turntables) is best on \\"Cure for the Itch\\" (duh), \\"With You\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\". Brad Delson (Guitar) shows off on \\"A Place for My Head\\", \\"By Myself\\", and \\"Points of Authoity\\". The singers are talented as well, and Chester Bennington does the best on \\"Pushing Me Away\\", \\"Runaway\\" and \\"Crawling\\", while Mike Shinoda does on \\"A Place for My Head\\", \\"Papercut\\", and \\"Forgotten\\". I am so sick of typing, and I thank you for taking the time to read my review.
B000060P79|5.0|Most punk bands sound alot alike. But Simple Plan isn't like other bands. They have there own sound and every song is a song that teenagers everywhere can relate to. Simple Plan has been around for a while and now are just starting to get recognized. They will make it big faster then you think. You should buy their cd before they really get big and it rasis in price.
B000000OUE|5.0|This CD is by far one of the best created. I mean, the songs are unique and hard and kick... From beginning to end, this CD delivers all that and a bag of chips! The rabid guitar style of Electric Head Pt.1; the kick ...lyrics of Super-Charger Heaven; the rather unique guitar and lyrical style of Real Solution #9; the speeding lyrics of Creature Of The Wheel; the rather \\"lighter\\" way of Electric Head Pt.2; the deep guitar of Grease Paint & Monkey Brains; the loud and fast pace of I, Zombie; the classic More Human Than Human; the hard pace of El Phantasmo & The Chicken Run Blast 'O Rama; the \\"deeper\\" kind of fast from Blur The Technicolor; and the grizzled lyrics and guitar of Blood, Milk, And Sky is what sums up a CD that has definately earned it's place in my top 10 favorites.
B00006690F|5.0|What can I say...<br />He's a lyrical genius. This is a very, very good cd. Even if you don't agree with everything he says, he's worth listening to. This man is a master of the English language...brilliant...<br />I don't even like rap much, and I adore him; he's just that good.<br />He talks about more than the typical rap topics, not just big screen tvs, fancy cars, money, etc. He talks about things that are not just for someone who's grown up in the hood. This music is for everybody...just to make you think...
B000065U1N|5.0|Great Movie, but man......... Some of those action scenes were just grusome. Ligaments flying off everywhere. This movie IS NOT for the weak at heart.
0312265859|5.0|As we've come to expect from Ms. Evanovich, Hard Eight is a bumpy, crazy ride in the amusement park that is Stephanie Plum's life.  Although Ms. Plum is a bounty hunter, it is obvious that she would find murder and mayhem, (not to mention sexy, complicated men), if she were a garbage collector.  The dialogue in this book is witty and sharp, and the plot twists are deliciously predictable.  Let's face it: we know the car is going to blow up, it's just a matter of when and how.  Anyone who is a fan of Ranger will have to take a cold shower when she's done with the book.  Morelli doesn't do too badly, either.  Thank goodness we can count on Evanovich to make Stephanie's men say things that most of us will go to our graves without hearing from actual men.  All in all, a fun evening of reading.

I Am Richard Wilson's Son John I'm 12 And Think Star Wars Is The Best Set Of Movies Ever. When My Friend Brought This Movie Over I Thought It Was Going To Be A Dumb Movie That Made Fun Of Star Wars And Other Films, But It Was Acually A Great Movie With Very Fun Jokes. The Character's Are Great Such As Dark Helmet, Lone Star, And Princess Vespa. If Your Looking For A Great Comedy Look No Further Than Spaceballs!
0385493622|5.0|Singh very pleasantly and thoroughly presents Fermat's theorem, the history of its unsuccessful proofs and its ultimate unraveling by Princeton's Andrew Wiles in a page-turning format that is enjoyable to those with or without mathematical interest or training.  Of course, he merely touches upon the actual mathematics which eventually proved this historical conundrum, yet what he does elaborate upon and excels at is exploring the mystique and ultimate truth that mathematics holds for many people.  Read this and you will thirst for and begin to understand what otherwise is usually presented dryly and for a very tiny audience:  the quest for logical and methodical truth fired by true imagination.
6305508550|4.0|A very light, funny satire on the life of the computer programmer and the world as they see it.  This story covers everything from matrix management, jaming fax machines, business improvement, to the cuicle with a window view.  Anyone that works in an office full of cubicles will relate to at least some part of this movie.  I particularly like the aspect of the &quot;quality&quot; slogans and consultants that come in to &quot;improve&quot; the company.  Many of us have already lived through this several times.<br />Very entertaining with a pretty good cast of people you will recognize.

B00005JKEC|4.0|I just watched Training Day and I have to say that I thought it was excellent. I am not an Ethan Hawke fan, though. His performance was what you might expect from a white rookie cop. He doesn't know the street, and thinks Alonzo (Denzel Washington) will give him a straight story. It is predictable that Alonzo will become (or already is) crooked. What is not known, however, is the way the story comes back to the person who is portrayed as one of Alonzo's best friends. <br />A great movie, but too much gratuitous violence. That's why I only give it 4 stars (4.5 actually).<br />-- teenlibrarian --
B00004HYLF|5.0|You may have never heard music like this before. After hearing it, you'll wonder why jazz-rock fusion didn't take over the music world. I put this in my car stereo and find myself switching from playing air piano to air drums to air guitar to air bass. Yes, I am dangerous with this CD in my car. But every note is a beautiful part of a gorgeous filagreed masterpiece, and I can't stand not playing every one. It grooves and rocks, soars and stops, keeps you on your toes, and delights you to the point of laughter. This disc is one of the finest recordings ever made--a gem among gems. And it's so full of surprises and variations, you will never tire of it. I've been listening to it for 23 years, and it delights me every single time.
B00003CXBK|5.0|It's Anime alright, but it isn't your typical Anime.  I would classify this under Classical Anime in a heartbeat but it also finds itself to be the first anime for most people.  Personally... it was my 4th Anime Movie.<br />Genre/Setting: Fantasy, Ancient Times surrounding the initial invention of the Gun and the mining of Iron.<br />Art Style, realistic and very beautiful, a worthy Masterpiece of art.  As you can tell i really enjoyed it.<br />Nudity: NONE... most anime has a little... even if it's a small insignificant scene it at least has something, but this anime... nope, not a thing.  A major reason it can be viewed with the entire family there.<br />Violence is low in comparison to other Anime.  But for the family scene, this Anime contains scenes of cartoon death, dismemberment and animal attacks.<br />It is the story of a young man who becomes cursed while saving his village from a demon.  The demon is actually a large Bore that became possesed by hatred when he was shot by a human.  The curse will spread throughout the young man's body until it kills him.  So, in the meantime he will journey to the heart of the evil behind the bore's hatred to learn for himself the truth \\"with eyes unclouded by hate\\", so that he may find peace.  From there the plot unfolds.<br />This is not a sword battle movie and though the image on the cover may appear like a lightsaberesque duel is taking place, i assure you it is not based on combat.  In fact the young man in the image rarely takes up his sword in any sort of battle... he's better with his arrows.  And as misleading as the Title may be, it does not have some sort of Helpless princess... Princess Mononoke is just a title given to the daughter of the wolf god.  The movie does have large animals who are like gods and even a forest god who reigns over all of them, but there is no preaching of this religion.<br />On the cast list are names like Claire Daines, Mimi Driver, Billybob Thorton, Gillian Anderson (who plays the role of the Wolf god, whose japanese voice is done by a really deep bass... kinda confusing).  With such names as these taking up the role then it's gotta have something in it right?  And i hear that it almost ran off with #1 movie in Japan, falling to the hyped up Titanic.  It is an anime that the entire family can enjoy and one that will remain classic to all Anime fans, casual and hardcore.  It was one of the first anime's my family saw, and trust me that the kids will love it... at least all the kids i know of have loved it.

B00005KARK|2.0|Lots of great features, but it doesn't play correctly on two of my three DVD players. It locks up on the JVC-XV-D723, and won't play on the Mac G3. The Imac G4 plays it fine. Nevertheless, it should work in all DVD players. I've contacted DisneyDVD about the problem, and we'll see how it goes.
B000056HRZ|5.0|Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart make Hollywood's most memorable couple in this classic story of love and intrigue, set during WWII. People come to Casablanca from all over the world in hope of getting an exit visa and a flight to America. Bogie plays the suave and cynical Rick, owner of a hot nightclub. Enter the lovely Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa, his love from pre-war Paris. She had disappeared without a word. It seems she had to leave suddenly because her husband, partisan fighter Paul Henreid, presumed dead, was alive and needed her. Rick never got over losing Ilsa, and now she comes to beg him for an exit visa for her husband. They relive old times (\\"You wore blue, the Germans wore gray\\") and discover the old spark is still there. But what to do with hubby?<br />There is so much romantic tension between Bogie and Bergman; they really ignite the screen. She is helpless in his arms, he isn't used to being noble... Ingrid was never lovelier and Bogie is Bogie.
B000065V1V|3.0|Ever since David Bowie reached rock bottom in 1987 with NEVER LET ME DOWN, reviews of his subsequent works have generally led off with \\"This is his best album since SCARY MONSTERS.\\" I've seen this or similar lines used in a few reviews to describe HEATHEN, as I have many times before for reviews of \\"HOURS...,\\" \\"EARTHLING,\\" \\"OUTSIDE,\\" \\"BLACK TIE, WHITE NOISE,\\" and even \\"TIN MACHINE.\\" The trouble is that the implied progression suggests that Bowie should be at the pinnacle of his talent. Sadly, he is not.<br />HEATHEN, basically a continuation of 2000'S \\"HOURS...\\" is pleasant and will satisfy fans. But I suspect that the perennial review line is not \\"His best album since the one he released two years ago\\" because much of Bowie's post-LET'S DANCE catalogue is only memorable to fans. This is too bad because two albums, \\"OUTSIDE\\" and \\"THE BUDDAH OF SUBURBIA\\" are better than that. HEATHEN has strong points, but is not a high impact album and will probably just contribute to the general impression that David Bowie was rather than is.<br />Since his heyday, Bowie has usually released albums that fall into one of two categories: works that will satisfy fans, and works designed to attract new fans. The latest example of the latter was probably the techno-style EARTHLING. I don't know how well that worked, but HEATHEN is not likely to attract any new fans. The most memorable song, \\"Cactus,\\" is a cover. The rest sort of blends together as a nice lullaby or comfortable background music. This is not especially innovative, as Brian Eno created ambient music back in the 70's (and past Bowie works built on Eno's innovation already).<br />There is not a single bad song on HEATHEN. Again, most fans who purchase this will be glad they did. But two years later, when the next Bowie album hopefully comes out, they will be back listening to ZIGGY STARDUST or STATION TO STATION, not HEATHEN. <br />As a fan myself, I'll be happy to take 20 more years of HEATEHNS and \\"HOURS...\\" but I like tothink that David Bowie has at least one great album left in him. This one isn't it.
B00005K3LU|4.0|A New York city cop (Bruce Willis) becomes embroiled in a fiery battle with terrorists who have taken over a Los Angeles high-rise.  This is by-the-numbers genre material all the way: invincible hero, African-American sidekicks, foreign villains, clueless superiors...if you've ever seen an action movie, you know the drill.  \\"Die Hard,\\" however, does all of this so well that it emerges as great entertainment, even as we realize how derivative it is.  Also on the plus side, Willis infuses his John McClaine with a humanity and an Everyman quality that makes him more of an Indiana Jones type than a fascist, omnipotent Dirty Harry clone.

B00001OH1S|5.0|Unlike almost every other sourndtrack I own, this is an album with so much to offer that you wont hesitate to plug it into your CD player for dinners, intimate ;-) gatherings and such where jazz fits the mood. It is, in short, one excellent jazz album. Sting's version of &quot;Windmills..&quot; is even better than the original, and his velvet smooth voice and the excellent music have you snapping your fingers and swaying to the sensuous music in no time. Nina Simone's classic, &quot;Sinnerman&quot;, one of my personal favorites, still makes the hair stand up on my arms out of the sheer pleasure I get from listening to this diva/vocalist's voice. &quot;Everything..&quot;, by Wasis Drop, is a fantastic Jazz love song. Conti's tracks are excellent as well. All in all, a great album to put into the stereo ...
6305252521|4.0|The inspiring and heartfelt character of Truman reminded me of Forrest Gump.  This may be Carrey's best performance ever even though it doesn't at all tap into his comedian skills.<br />This movie has many interpretations, but the one that stuck out most in my mind was that of \\"the truth shall set you free\\" versus \\"ignorance is bliss.\\"<br />Truman lives in an artificial world where all his \\"friends\\" and even his wife are paid actors.  Even the weather is fake and controlled.  The director Christof defends that Truman's world is just as real as the \\"real world\\" only Truman's world is much safer, more pleasant, etc.  <br />Once Truman begins to discover the truth of his world, his exploring nature leads him to break free from the studio world despite opposition, discomfort, and even endangerment to his life.  This is supposed to show that truth is better than deception and that we have free will, etc.  But if you think about it, Truman really had little choice.  How could he get in bed with wife again knowing that all along, she has been a paid actor, as have been all his friends.  How could he live with the betrayal; how could he continue as he had before knowing the world is watching him 24hrs a day?  <br />In the ending, Truman is on the border of the studio.  On one side is a pretty blue sky with a cheerful, although artificial, sun, and on the other side is an open door leading into complete darkness-- the outside \\"real\\" world.  After a conversation with Christof, he steps through the door, proclaiming a phrase he had used with his next door neighbors every morning, \\"In case I don't see ya- good afternoon, good evening, and goodnight!\\"  Inspiring, but like I said, the real issue is whether or not Truman will ever wish he had never found out the truth about the studio world-- he was quite happy until he found out, after all.  I guess it will depend upon what life he makes for himself on the outside.  I think sometimes we want to be deceived or ignorant about things and other times we want the truth.  The truth can hurt and it isn't always \\"enlightening.\\"<br />The role of Christof introduces themes of God because that's what role he played.  When Truman and his best \\"friend\\" were sitting watching the artificial sunset, his friend remarked about what a paintbrush He has.  In the end when Christof is talking with Truman, he's speaking from above; Truman can't even see him nor has he ever met him although Christof has been watching him all Truman's life.  An interesting debate is whether or not Christof did Truman more good than harm.  When Truman behaves as he wants him to, Christof is benevolent to him.  When Truman tries to leave the studio, he is very wrathful.  Obviously, Christof's interests are not necessarily the same as Truman's and he decides he is better off rebelling despite Christof's retaliation.  Most of the viewers seem totally happy about Truman's escape from the studio so it seems that he will not be replaced by another character.  Overall, it is an inspiring, thought-provoking, and unique story.  \\"The Matrix\\" is similar, in that people are put into artificial worlds which exist only on computer.
B00003CXI1|5.0|If you've read the book first, you will still really enjoy this detailed and wonderful account of Harry Potter and his new adventures in a magical world within our world.  I have read and listened to the books-on-tape, and I really enjoyed the film.  The acting was excellent.  A different kind of role for Richard Harris (&quot;A Man Called Horse&quot; and &quot;Man in the Wilderness&quot;).  The brick wall on Diaganon Alley was a brilliant piece of special effect work.  This is a film that you can watch again and again.
B0000501C3|5.0|This album contains the most astonishing and powerful music I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Listening to it induces a variety of emotions, with extreme satisfaction prevailing in the end. While I enjoy most other classical music, the sheer length of the compositions goes beyond my attention span, which is precisely what makes this album so perfect - most tracks are between 2 to 4 minutes long. I prize this CD above all others in my collection, (which totals approximately 150, many being classical,) and listen to it on a weekly basis.
B00000I49J|4.0|this album was a breath of fresh air compare to their first, &quot;psycocandy.&quot;  It's different by being much more melodic and no feedback whatsoever.  What makes this album better than the first is the songs are actually &quot;songs.&quot; Darklands is one of the Mary Chain's best album, along with Honey's Dead and my personal fav, Automatic.

B00005JKJA|4.0|Okay, to all the reviwers who thought this movie made no sense, shame on you.  You haven't really been paying attention.  Everything in this movie has it's place.  It does take a little effort to figure out, but there is a purpose to this film.  Heres my take:<br />In the beginning of the film we are shown Dianne's POV as she begins to sleep (the bed & pillow).  We are then introduced to the Rita character as shes about to be murdered.  An accident foils the murder plan and Rita loses her memory.  What follows is a very important part of the film that most people seem to miss.  There are a few characters \\"pulling the strings\\".  These are the guys on the phone, the guy in the wheelchair,  the brothers who later visit Adam the director, the grifter behind the wall, and The Cowboy.  These guys are working to insert Camilla Rhodes as the star in Adam's film.  These characters are caught in a loop until they get it right. (Making Camilla the star.)  That's why the people at the table in the meeting with the director know what's going to happen (ex: the man who calls out for an espresso has researched it and acquired (or so he thinks) the best espresso.  <BR>The Betty character is nothing more than a guide although she doesn't know it.  Betty is \\"sent\\" NOT to help Rita find her identity, but to eliminate her from the loop.  The Betty character is accompanied by the two seniors who are also working \\"behind the scenes\\" to get Camilla Rhodes to be the star of Adams flick.<br />Rita (who was Camilla) now has no identity.  She is no longer a player in the game. Her existence is now merely a blunder (because of the accident.)  The new Camilla (the girl in the picture shown in the meeting) is the new variable and all other varibles (Rita, Dianne) are inconsequential. <BR>Betty & Rita attend club Silencio only to realize that \\"it's all an illusion\\".  The performer states that \\"There is no band\\".  There are no performers and whatever happens is pre-destined (tape recorded).  Bettyis given the box that will eliminate them from the loop.  Betty disappears because she has done her job (guiding Rita to Club Silencio & finding the box).  When Rita uses the key to unlock the box she is gone as if she never existed. <BR>The second half of the film recalls what led up to the hit being put out on the then Camilla(Rita).  The movie switches from past (the party scene) to present (when Diannes neighbor gets her stuff back).  The last part of the film re-introduces the \\"guides\\" that accompanied Betty (who's job it was to remove Rita from the loop.)  The guides drive Dianne to kill herself, thus eliminating both extraneous variables (Rita and Dianne) from the picture. Now theres a clean slate where the \\"new\\" Camilla can take her role as a star.<BR>The bumbling hitman character kills the guy who foiled Ritas murder.  (Remember, they talk about a car accident where he was most likely a participant.)  But, that was just an aside as the hitmans goal was to acquire his book (which was not important to the film aparently). <BR>The Key the hitman gives Dianne signifies that the hit has succeeded and \\"Camilla\\" is dead.<BR>The grifter behind the wall seems to be the one who actually cleans up the loose ends.  Through his actions, and his box, all three main characters(Rita, Betty, Dianne) are eliminated from the timeline thus cementing the new \\"Camilla\\" as the star of Adams movie. <br />The movie is about the forces at work behind the scenes.  In this case a young Starlett named Camilla Rhodes.  The story that Lynch chooses to tell represents the consequences that those forces have on others.  The manipulation of names & faces & identities as variables in a bizarre formula to achieve stardom.  The characters seemingly play out a destiny or fate to suit  a desired result, but they had to work at it a few times to get it right.<br />At any rate, this is the conclusion I came to when watching this film.  Oh yeah, it only gets 4 stars because the DVD has no comentary and minimal extras.  Still its a genius of a film.  Direction, acting, soundtrack, it's all there, best movie I've seen since Donnie Darko.

B00006690F|5.0|First of all, Shady is probably the greatest all time rapper that is still alive. I can't put him ahead of Tupac And Biggie yet, but he's getting there. Some great tracks are sqaure dance, White America, Cleanin out my closet, 'Till I collapse, and much much more! Eminem may still have that \\"criminal\\" fire burning inside of him but he shows the soft side of him also on this album in tracks such as, Haley's Song, and My dad's gone crazy. Most of this is devoted to his daughter Haley Jade. I could go on and on about this phenom of an album but I will sum it all up with 4 more words... GO BUY IT NOW!!!!!
B000066NW0|3.0|Now, this is only based on seeing the one video for \\"Complicated\\". I woke up this morning and put on Mtv, and there was this girl- She looks like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but the song sounds kinda country (I could see LeeAnn or somebody singing it), and she was all dressed in punk clothes and there was skating happening... And it looked like she had Aaron Carter as a guitarist? Then they trashed a mall?<br />Now maybe I'm too old for this stuff (26), but I just *don't* get it....<br />By the end of the video, I had kinda gotten into it, but it hasn't stayed in my head all day. In fact, I couldn't remember the name of the song. The only lyric that stuck was \\"And you fall and you crawl and you take what you get\\"... Oh well.<br />Let me see another video, I'm a little interested. Not going to run out and get the cd just yet though.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|This films failure is at large due to poor editing. Then opening sequence is played out over about 10-minutes using the same song played live, the opening boxing match that follows is slow, boring and long (where is the editing??) I felt like the film was wasting my time and I had almost already gone to sleep. I let it play out about fifteen minutes and then noticed the full running time of the movie (where is the editing). Didn't finish it so my two star rating is only for the first thirty minutes or so of the film. I wouldn't bother.
0780623819|3.0|The Year is 2058.  Earth's resources are running low.  The &quot;Jupiter Mission&quot; will go to a planet called &quot;Alpha Prime&quot;, the only other planet that can support human life.  The Robinson family is going to Alpha Prime.  The Trip to Alpha Prime is 10 long years. However, Dr. Smith tampers with the on-ship robot to destroy the Jupiter 2.  Smith's plan backfires, and he's forced to seek the help of the Robinson Family to stop the rampaging robot.  The family is truly lost in space.<br />  A good sci-fi flick!
B0000640VN|5.0|This film was wonderful.  I hated leaving the theater.  I have to admit that this wasn't Meg Ryan's best film; she acted like she was bored and tired with these type of roles.  Hugh Jackman was a real delight to watch.  His versatility is diplayed quite well.  It will be interesting to see what happens with his career.<br />This film demonstrates what I am sure a lot of women out there dream of; being able to find their Prince Charming and living happily ever after.  This film may not be for the guys, but ladies if you want to be able to get together with your friends and have a &quot;girls night&quot; don't be afraid to chase the guys out and have some time where tears and stary eyes and &quot;Awh&quot; moments are alowed.
B000002HPV|5.0|Musically, I am a pretty diverse person, I like all sorts of music. I don't like music because of a specific genre, I like the music because something about it grabs me and pulls me in. Thats just how this is. Bjork should make more music like this. When I heard this, I thought I was dreaming, the electronica mixed with the orchestral sounds, the moving sounds of the cellos, and that alien voice which tops everything off. Bjork hypnotizes you in this album, its such a powerful noise. But if you're new to Bjorks music, then I definitely would not reccomend jumping on this album first, you should start out with Debut, her first album. Debut is really the closest I think that Bjork has ever came to what people refer to as \\"pop\\", though it still isn't. Once you're immune to the sound of Debut, then work your way up to Post, and then to this because this just isn't for beginners. You have to know Bjork before you hear this one because then this will just freak you out or just be difficult to understand. Everything is perfect on this album, the arrangement, the mood, its set up perfectly. If you really want to make the most of this album, you'll listen to every song beginning with \\"Hunter\\" all the way till \\"All Is Full Of Love.\\" Once I listened I was hooked, and I have yet to hear better.
B00004RFFI|3.0|Twister has a worthy premise, some thrilling action sequences, and a great deal of potential, yet disappointingly is a film that adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Tornadoes cut swathes of devastation through mid-USA every year and television audiences the world over are shocked and yet strangely titillated by the resulting newsreel footage. So as a film following a group of (fictional) storm chasers as they attempt to scientifically measure a tornado from the inside (with a view to improving the warning systems), Twister has all the ingredients of an extraordinary viewing experience. It is certainly fast-paced and exciting, but also regrettably formulaic. <br />Cliches abound - cute dogs saved from imminent peril; chaser crews composed of stereotypical weirdo science nerds; a daring rescue from a destroyed house seconds before it collapses; some unexorcised trauma about a father's death-by-tornado; Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt cheating death innumerable times, even as the bad guys (rival tornado chasers) succumb. . . . . . . . . . <br />The special effects are what save this film from mediocrity. The tornadoes are frighteningly real and the debris showers (including a cow and a petrol tanker) will have audiences ducking for cover. And unlike many disaster films that seem to drag as they build to a climax, the tornadoes in Twister appear right from the word go. Bizarrely the soundtrack to the tornadoes was made by dubbing a camel's groan and slowing it down - resulting in some rather odd sounding twisters. By the time the camel is finally silenced and the story reaches its predictable conclusion, the cliches and improbabilities threaten to overwhelm, and the film ultimately fails to completely satisfy.
B00003CXI1|3.0|I'm one of those adults who's read the books but missed seeing the movie in the theatres and tried the DVD instead. I found the casting to be very good, although Emma Watson as Hermione is too pretty. The story was amazingly faithful to the book, which is very unusual for any book/ movie adaptation with just a few things edited out or rearranged (I believe Hagrid's gift of the photo album to Harry was a Christmas present, not a going home from school gift). It was certainly close enough that a movie viewer could probably get away with claiming to have read the book. I found the 2nd disc to be infuriatingly difficult to get through, most kids won't like to try that stuff. If , as at least one reviewer says, the seven deleted scenes are that hard to find (why doesn't something tell you they exist and how to look for them?)they'd better be good to put up with that run around.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Of course the movie itself is great on DVD. The extra disc is no big deal. It is difficult to navigate the &quot;special&quot; features and very frustrating that there is not more there. I missed full bios on the cast, as I have been enjoying that on other DVDs.  But, this DVD set is worth the price any day!! Harry Potter is alive again in my living room!
B00005JKNF|4.0|It took me about three times of watching this movie to truly like it.  I was very disappointed at first.  The storyline moves along VERY slowly and there are so many characters that it is difficult to keep track of who's who.  There is an immense build-up to the murder, but then discovering \\"who done it?\\" seems to be of little importance to the characters, director, and writers.  <br />Good parts: Maggie Smith steals the whole movie!  What a brilliant actress who adds such wonderful sarcastic snobbery to her role.  The whole \\"Upstairs/Downstairs\\" idea of the lives of the rich and the lives of the servants is very interesting.  An otherwise dull storyline is spiked up with several things happening at once.  <br />If you don't like the movie the first or second time, try it a third time.  By then, you'll either love it or hate it.
0385501005|1.0|You know those tedious, uncomfortable times in a relationship when you have A Talk and hash over stuff like Where Things Are Going?  This book is one long string of those talks with not much else in between.  They're hard enough to get through in real life; they're really boring in a book where you don't care much for those involved.<br />Duffy's girlfriend, Mel, is one of those women I detest (and I'm female, FYI) who, when you ask &quot;What's wrong?&quot; will say &quot;Nothing&quot; 50 gazillion times before you drag out whatever trivial tidbit she's been stewing over for days.  Or, say, if you don't like the same piece of furniture she likes in a store, as Duffy does, she'll take it as an insult to the relationship, create a scene, and not talk to you for days.  Meanwhile, everyone Duffy knows tells him she's a prize and that he'll never find anyone better.  But very little is ever shown to the reader to illustrate what's so great about her or why Duffy loves her so much in the first place.  I just wanted him to dump her and move on.<br />This book doesn't even compare to anything by Nick Hornby.  Yes, the style is irreverent and light, but it's never all out funny and witty, like Hornby, nor does it have any of his insight and wisdom.  With so little going for it, it soon became a chore to finish reading.  Like another reviewer said, this is merely riding the wave of Bridget Jones' success and probably would never have made it on its own.
0385335482|4.0|I spent today reading and finishing this.  I absolutely loved it!  Rebecca is a shopaholic.  Whenever she passes a store, she must go in.  If it's a sale, even better.  She's also a journalist for a financial magazine.  But while she writes about financial matters, her own are falling apart.  She's starting to go into debt with her credit card habits.  And she begins to follow her father's advice: CB or MMM.  Cut back, or make more money.  Both attempts add to the story's humor.<br />There's also a bit of romance, and Rebecca's bank statements add to the hilariousity of the novel.  It's altogether simply captivating.
B000002IPZ|2.0|Testament is one of my favorite bands, but I found this album to be a disappointment. This music is practically easy listening compared to the incredible &quot;The New Order&quot;. Unfortunately, Testament just sound uninspired here. Get The New Order instead.
0316776963|4.0|I really didn't think I would enjoy reading this book.  I'm a married, 30-year-old mother from the midwest, so I didn't think I could really relate to the life of a middle-aged gay man living in France.  However, I thought it was really good for the most part.  Not all the essays were funny, but most were, and I laughed my butt off at \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" particularly about the Easter bell.  I found his honesty about his own shortcomings particularly refreshing.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt's latest album is great. It is much better than the nonsense being produced today. They have successfuly put together hip-hip- regeea and 80's new wave and make it sound excellent. I would highly recommend this record. I have the great pleasure of hearing the band perform the album live at Cornell U and it reenforced my opinion of the album. All the songs on the album are great. I also loved Return of Saturn. I can't understand why no one loved their last album wasn't a bigger hit or why this one isn't in the top five albums on billboard. I think they are one of the most underrated artists out today.ROCK STEADY RULES !!
0783226063|5.0|I just LOVE this movie! It is in my personal top 10. Great score! Great cast! Memorable lines! Beautiful themes! Do not confuse this Dune with the scifi channel miniseries Dune. The latter is not worth more than ten minutes of your time. <br />I would also suggest reading the Frank Herbert books if you like this movie.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I dont really like a lot of the &quot;alternative&quot; music out there; Dave Matthews just doesn't delight me as he does to practically everyone in America.  However, John Mayer is the BEST new artist I've heard in years.  Listening to his music, you can really feel the passion that he has for singing and songwriting...its an incredible experience.  I truly enjoy listening to him sing, something that I don't say about anyother artist out there.  This CD is great, and I would reccomend it to everybody!
B00000JLWW|5.0|Ok, honestly who is left who hasn't seen this movie? These reviews are just a forum for the Titanic haters and lovers to duke it out. Well, put me in with the lovers. I saw Titanic the first day it opened and have watched it many times now. I cannot understand why people don't like this movie unless it is just because there has been a backlash to its popularity and people think it's &quot;hip&quot; to hate Titanic.
0679879269|4.0|The Amber Spyglass is one of the most intriguing books that I have ever read. It all started when my friend, who had just finished The Golden Compass, forced me to go to the library and get the Golden Compass. I read the Golden Compass and was delighted. I read the Subtle Knife and was delighted. And now I have finished this trilogy and I still feel delighted. I love the way the book was written but I only have one pet peeve. As soon as the book gets really exciting, another beloved character dies. It happens so often in this book, as soon as it's really exciting, yet another beloved character dies. It just takes a little away from the excitement and lovelyness of the story. I'm not Christian, but I know some Christians have a hard time with the Rebellion part of the book, but all you need to remember is that this is a book. There are so many subplots it's almost like reading several different books at once but all the plots come together in the end in a magical way. Mary and mulefa were my favorite to read about. This is definitely a great book, but not my favorite.
6300182282|5.0|I was introduced to this film by a guy friend when I was 16 y/o.<BR>This film  holds special meaning to me for a lot of different ways.<BR>The movie is a storyline about two married people over a period of 26 years. The characters go through the up's and down's over<BR>their years. The ending is bittersweet, very heart breaking, and<BR>probably the best ending for the film. <BR>A movie for those who love Romance even if means a \\"Cheating Couple\\". Watch it!!!
6304806442|5.0|I first caught Trainspotting in '96 when it was released in theaters. I had not read the book but I figured a movie about Scottish hoodlums who were heroin addicts sounded interesting, so I checked it out. Man, what a film! The cast was flawlessly assembled by director Danny Boyle and includes a career making performance by Ewen McGregor. But, McGregor's supporting cast is what really makes Trainspotting stand out above most other films. Robert Carlyle is simultaneously hilarious and chilling as Begbie, the elder statesman of the group who in fact is the only one who is not a heroin addict. As Renton(McGregor's character) states \\"...Begbie didn't do drugs, he did people.\\" So true. Begbie is a psychopath in the purist sense of the word. He's a thief, a batterer, and a big time alcoholic, not the kind of guy you want to piss off. Carlyle literally steals every scene he is in and is almost impossible to understand with his ultra-thick Scottish accent. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, the pretty boy of the group who also happens to be the most well adjusted with the innate ability to dump his heroin addiction cold turkey. Ewen Bremner plays the dummy of the group to perfection, he is crude and slow-witted but ultimately good hearted. Ewen McGregor's Renton is a complex and dark character who is torn between doing the right thing and living a clean, normal life and his terrible addiction. Trainspotting is a realistic film. Renton doesn't just kick his habit but goes through several relapses. Renton wants a better life for himself but needs a break to get out of his lower class town and towards the end of the film the opportunity presents itself. Trainspotting has been called \\"A Clockwork Orange for the '90's\\" which I tend to disagree with. Trainspotting is not a visual journey as Clockwork is but they are both a study of human nature. Trainspotting's central characters are nowhere near as vicious as Kubrick's Droogs who raped, beat, stole, and terrorized at will. Boyle's characters have heart and you can feel their pain and emotions, you ultimately come to care about them. In Clockwork, Alex is finally getting his just desserts. Anyway, Trainspotting a great watch and addition to any DVD collection. Highly Recommended.characters have heart and you can feel their pain and emotions, you ultimately come to care about them.

6304211740|3.0|Out of the four versions (that I know about) of Jane Eyre in movie format, there was only one that truly stood out as being completely representative of the book, and that was the Timothy Dalton version in 1971.  I thought he overacted a little, but that played with the character, so I can pass over that negative...however the interaction between him and Zarah (Black?) was much too unbelievable and strained.  <br />If you want a version to cuddle up with on a rainy Saturday afternoon, then either the William Hurt (1996) or the Orson Welles version in the 40's would be splendid.  The 1997 Samantha Morton/Ciaran Hinds version is my favorite though, being that it really pulls the viewer into the romance of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester, even though it cuts and manipulates many of the scenes and actions so as not to be completely recognizable to book enthusiasts.  <br />I have loved this book from the first time I read it, and it is on top of my all time favorite books.  At first, I was disappointed with all the film versions, but after taking the time to really sit down and review and compare each of these (with waaaaaay too much time on my hands in college) I realized what these different versions were trying to do and grew to appreciate all of them for what they are.  <br />No one can recreate the literary masterpiece on film, as is true with almost all classics.  I recommend this film for those who like symbolism over blatant scene recreation, but for those who want the cliffs notes version of the book in form if not fact, try the A&amp;E version (1997).  If you like pouty acting with great record-scratchy sound and the visual depth that only black and white film can give you, Orson Welles is your man.  However, if you are a true book enthusiast, the BBC miniseries with Timothy Dalton is the most true to form and will get you an &quot;A&quot; on your book report ;)
B000065U1N|5.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" is a film that proves that combat and war is no less brutal terrifying than it was in the days of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam.  No where in this film is the violence ever glamourized or made to seem good, war is a terrible thing, but unfortunately it is something that has been with man since its beginning and most likely until its end.  All the young actors like Josh Hartnett and Ewan McGregor show the youthfulness of the Rangers who were on average no older than 18, while the Delta soldiers were hardened veterans going back to Vietnam.  Ridley Scott did an excellant job showing that no matter how well the training, you can never be fully prepared, which we learned, but unfortunately at the cost of 19 American lives and thousands of Somali lives.  The scenes which include the Humvee convoy being chopped to pieces and Michael Durants crash site being overrun show the horrors of combat and how true heros are made in the heat of battle and never intentionally.  The constant moving of the camera and scenes gives you the unsettling \\"you-are-there\\" feeling that most war films include.  And because my brother was among that Humvee convoy and at the time I was living at the base from which the 160th SOAR pilots came from, this is more than a movie for me but more a tribute to the true heros who gave their lives and came home to those honorable, yet heartbreaking funerals for those who give their lives for their country.  \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was the film for our grandfathers, \\"Platoon\\" was for our fathers and uncles, but \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is for our brothers.

Avril's songs are unique and you can feel her pain and emotions while listening to her.  Her style is cool too and she does what she feels is right for her and doesn't just go with what everyone else is doing.  She's a cool... skater-punk chick who's gonna take over!

They fall in love but she thinks she's unloveable. until she realizes she is ready for love.

0345347951|5.0|It takes a good author to make a book the reader can laugh to, a great author to make a reader cry, and an extraordinary author to make his/her reader look at life in a new way. So speaking, Arthur C. Clarke doesn't disappoint. Clarke has created a superbly superior story in CHILDHOOD'S END. This book is not one that a reader appreciates in only one reading, but with each time around the reader encounters more insight into the story and life, itself. <BR>   Clarke's use of literary devices and dialect allows a complicated story to unravel into another life-like dimension. It is almost plausible to believe that events such as these could occur in the near-future, and that entities such as the Overminds exist. In fact, Clarke's creation has allowed an occasion for a reader to correlate humanity's cultural evolutions to that of humanity's intellectual/spiritual evolution in CHILDHOOD'S END. Clarke, again, has created a masterpiece that inspires readers of all ages.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I was pleasantly shocked at the creativeness of this movie. The effects were amazing to say the least. The movie theatre was packed full of very small children, my 5 year old sitting beside me, my other 3 older children close by, and the place was totally silent. Glued to the screen they were captivated from the beginning to the end. I was very skeptical that Tobey Maguire could be a Super Hero, he enters as such a quiet, meek and shy boy but becomes this sweet, caring do-gooder that you can't help but love.  I have never been a Spider Man fan, but I can't wait for a sequel. They better keep Tobey though, nobody else could pull it off.
0553260111|5.0|I picked up the Bourne Identity because I was looking for a book to read and saw the previews for the movie.  As soon as I read the first page I couldn't put the book down.  Ludlum knows how to write and grips you from the first words to the last words.  The book combines facts with fiction and leaves you wondering about what was truth and what wasn't, along with a number of other things.  The book is too complicated to even begin to go into, with plot twists almost every chapter.  One page you think Bourne is one person, then by the next page you are convinced he is someone else.  The during the next chapter you KNOW who he is, only to find out you were completely wrong the next chapter.  All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  The movie, however, only shares the title and a few minor details with the book.  Bourne doesn't even hold the same identity at the end of the movie as he does in the book.  But the book is a great read.
B00002DE2L|5.0|My one disappointment with this album is a sloppiness in the Trondheim Soloists. (I am not much of a musician myself; this is just my subjective perception. Feel free to flame me at your convenience.) This is isolated, rare and a minor complaint anyway, but very noticeable during the first movement of Winter. They just don't even sound like they're *together* in places.<br />But this is my one minor nitpick. Authenticity? BAH! This is by far the most soulful, the most gleeful, the most FUN recording of Vivaldi I've ever heard.<br />I don't need to mention what an amazing virtuoso Anne-Sophie Mutter is. Instead I'll just gush over her solos -- the way she can dig into a note and make it growl agressively like a gospel singer, the way she can manipulate the tempo as if it were elastic... there's so much going on here it makes me giddy listening to it.<br />Gratuitous packaging photos of the admittedly beautiful Ms. Mutter aside, this album doesn't strike me as some academic study in the baroque period. It strikes me more as a group of brilliant musicians indulging themselves and throwing their hearts and souls into an off-beat interpretation of a staple piece of music.<br />Don't get this album because you're looking for a technically perfect or accurate recording of Vivaldi. Get it because it's more fun than baroque music fans should be having.
B00004YYDI|5.0|The way the movie was shot, written, and directed gives it a feel of a classic as well as a modern feel no matter how old it gets. The corruption of a little girl in a drug dealing family and combine it with a hitman as believable as Leon, the combination ends up in innnocence combined with deathscythe in a gun weilding 'damn these guys know how to shoot movies' feel. I highly recommend this to anyone who has seen Snatch, Fifth Element, Memento, or Requiem for a Dream. One of the best films I have ever stumbled upon in years.
B00000JFV9|5.0|THOUGH I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE FILM SUPERFLY, AFTER HEARING THE SOUNDTRACK I FEEL I KNOW THE FILM LIKE THE BACK OF MY HAND.  CURTIS MAYFIELD IS A GENIUS WHOSE MUSIC TRANSCENDS GERNERATIONS.  I COULD LISTEN TO THIS SOUNDTRACK A MILLION TIMES IN A DAY AND NEVER TIRE FROM IT.  EACH SONG DEALS WITH A SPECIFIC MOOD OR CHARACTER IN THE FILM GIVING THE SOUNDTRACK A VERY INTIMATE FEELING. <br />AN ESSENTIAL FUNK MASTERPEICE
B000002MTR|5.0|Hmmm...what to say...<br />You can definitely tell Dave Navarro's influence on this album, and it kicks. Although I also like John Frusciante and Hillel Slovak as guitarists....<br />This is a semi-departure from normal Peppers, but it's extremely soulful, with a lot of unexpected twists and turns along the way...kind of crossing their EMI days with heavier, louder rock like Bush or Soundgarden. But it's still Peppers, and \\"Shallow be Thy Name\\" and \\"Tearjerker\\" prove that. Although the first track, \\"Warped\\", is the most catchy, and also the most raw.<br />This is not a good Peppers intro album, that's its only flaw. I suggest getting Californication of Blood Sugar Sex Magik before you get the others.
B000009O8A|3.0|This movie honestly examines the realities of big city vs. small city life.  While newspaper headlines accuse big cities of being crime ridden and small towns being safehavens of good values, this movie powerfully exposes that false myth.<br />A young writer from the Big City of New York goes to a small town believing she will find serenity.  She instead is brutally raped in an approximately 40 minutes (originally 57 minutes and was cut down to make it less graphic if you can believe it) scene. <br />As hard as it is for big city folk to comprehend in their sheltered environment, this is normal everyday life in a small town.  This is the only movie I know that brings the experience of the realities and horrors of small town living to the safety and security of the big city home.<br />Should not be used as entertainment but for understanding of this dark world.
B000002LQR|4.0|This is a very good album, but I tend to listen to the next two (One Hot Minute, Californication) more often than this.<br />The ear is intrigued at first at the typical Peppers blend of funk and rock, charged with a creative sexual energy...also one of their trademarks (remember the socks??). But for some reason, with repeated playings, this album loses a lot of its edge...I guess the shock value on songs such as \\"Suck my Kiss\\" and \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" has been nearly eliminated on repeated playings, and that is what gives this album 4 stars instead of 5. 5 is when you listen to it for the first few times, and it makes you guffaw, dance around, and set up an Anthony Kiedis shrine in your closet because you feel the energy...the bloos sugar sex magik, if you will. But the magik becomes less potent as time goes on, unfortunately.
0312265859|4.0|As always, devouring the latest Stephanie Plum novel took far too little time, and left me wishing I'd savoured the book instead.  Not possible.  I was on it faster than Vinnie on the aleged duck, and I don't regret it a bit.<BR> <BR>Fans will not be upset with the typical crazy-life Stephanie events.  Her sister Valerie is still about, and losing her perfect sainthood.  Grandma Mazur is alive and kicking and still ready with the perfect ill-timed comment.  Lula buys boots and dyes her hair.  Cars explode.  Bob vomits.  Crazed rabbits, bears, and ex-presidents are chasing down Steph... and just you wait until you get to the geese incident.<BR> <BR>Then there's the romantic confusion.  Morelli, Ranger, and Stephanie hit the peak of their sexual tension in this book, and tip over in a way that knocked me reeling.  I wasn't expecting who ended up sleeping with who, and what it meant.  How's that for a vague way to avoid plot spoiling?  It was definitely worth the ride, though.<BR> <BR>Aside from the zany and the romantic, however, there's a darker tone that we've not seen since the very first book.  Echoes of the psychotic boxer return in another character, and the whole issue of battered wives fleeing their husband with children they've snatched away in the middle of the night is not your usual Plum story.  That said, it fit.  As the stakes rose - and grew more serious than the usual Steph life-catastrophes of the previous books - so did the emotional reactions of the characters involved.  And the ending will blow you away: I refuse to give it away, but I was left with a real bit of gutwrench.  This one doesn't leave you dangling with a romantic \\"Oh gosh!\\"  It leaves you stunned with a \\"Yow... harsh!\\"<BR> <BR>The story does wind up a bit quickly after dancing and drawing itself out - the pace is a bit breakneck at the end as things suddenly all reach the denouement, the book's only real failing.  But otherwise, prepare to laugh out loud throughout, and be a little surprised at the content in this one.  \\"Hard Eight\\" is hard indeed.<BR> <BR>'Nathan
B00000J7JO|5.0|I have owned this CD for two years now, and it's one of the ones I dig out of my CD holder to listen to again and again. Never tire of hearing &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Easily&quot;, &quot;Get on Top&quot;...actually the whole CD keeps me enthralled.<br />This is one of the best Peppers albums to date...I hate to admit it, but I enjoy it more than BSSM. John Frusciante is back at the guitarist's helm (yaaay!), and the lyrics kick booty here...very pensive.
B000066NW0|5.0|On Avril's Debut CD, Let Go, Avril proves alot on this CD, and also acomplishes what she's come to do. She proves that it is possible to sing, and that she can do it with style as well. With songs like the Rocking song, Sk8er Boi to the Pop-ish sounding style with songs like My World and I'm With You she proves that her talents aren't limited to just one genre of music. She also plays with rap on her song Nobody's Fool, but can't just get it right.<br />For only being 17, she's got an amazing voice, and she can write her own songs too as compared to other pop acts that come out on the scene. This CD features 13 original songs written by Avril about everything from Love, life and everything that a Guy or girl can relate to. This is a Must Have CD if you like Blink 182 or Matchbox 20
B000001ESP|5.0|Its hard to believe that Moving Pictures was released over 20 years ago.  With such hindsight it has become more apparent that those of us fortunate enough to have heard Tom Sawyer the first time it was played on local radio were witnesses to a turning point in modern music.  While Rush has continued to amaze me over the years and release outstanding records this one stands over the others as a highpoint of their creativity.  I find it hard to believe that another rock band could put together 7 songs in a complete package that flow from song to song so perfectly.  The emotion, sound, vocals, percussion, guitars, and bass all have yet to be matched by ANY other band.  This record should be on any list of the alltime greatest recordings.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is new and she is rocking the music world. Whether it is with her single &quot;Complicated&quot; or any of the other songs on the album, you can always be sure that they will be amazingly good. Already having reached # 1 on MuchMusic in Canada and sure to soon head to # 1on TRL on MTV, you can only begin to imagine where this teenager from Ontario can go. Check out the album and see why so many people are turning over and listening to Avril Lavigne!
B00000F3KL|4.0|First I must admit that I a big fan of military history, war movies, and a former US Army officer, so I had big expectations for this movie.  Having read the book before seeing the movie, overall I am pleased with the results.<br />The movie does a solid job of telling the tragic and heroic story of what happened to US soldiers in Somalia during this infamous raid.  The filming is very well done, and I think the director really captures the look and feel of the chaos that unfolded that day.  Be warned, some of the scenes are pretty graphic, and there is a lot of blood since the fighting was non-stop and both sides relentless during this battle.  If the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan make you squirm, this film may also make you a bit uncomfortable.<br />The story itself is tragic, for both sides.  Casualties are heavy for the Somalies, and American lost some of its finest soldiers.  The movie does a pretty balanced job of showing how no one really won this battle.<br />But, on the other hand, the story is also inspirational, in that it shows what a group of well trained, close knit, US soldiers can accompish, despite the enormous odds they face.  This battle could have turned into a modern day Little Big Horn, if it were not for the actions of these fine soldiers, NCOs, and officers during this crisis.  When all is said and done, I am thankful that the US has soldiers who are willing to pay the ultimate price for freedom.<br />One warning that I will pass along is that the movie may be hard to follow if you have not read the book, or are unfamiliar with US military operations.  Also, no real character develop takes place, the events of the day are the main focus of the film.  So, if you are expecting to learn a lot about the men who fought in this battle you will probably be disappointed by this film.<br />Having said that, I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning more about the events that occurrerd during this raid.  The movie is shot like a documentary, so I think you will learn a lot, and be proud of the men who fought that day.  RLTW.s shot like a documentary, so I think you will learn a lot, and be proud of the men who fought that day.  RLTW.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Not having read the book, i really enjoyed this flick and if fact was surprised at how much i liked it. I can totally understand why the books appeal to old and young kids. <br />I wondered if buying the Widescreen Edition and viewing it on a small tv (less than 20 in) would take away from the viewing experience, I am happy to say it did not.<br />The DVD itself has some kinda cool sections for kids to check out and interact with. Unlike some other dvds, you actually have to hunt for the deleted scenes or at the very least pay attention to menus.
B00000AFHM|3.0|First off let me say that B&amp;S is perhaps my favortite band still around today.  Thier music is simply the best there is out there.  However I thought this album didn't do justice to the band and thier talents.  Yes the songs are just as buautifull (and bitting) as those on thier first two releases but the music itself is far inferior to what's on &quot;...Sinister&quot; and &quot;Tigermilk&quot;, And honestly lyrics backed by dull, repetative and often overdone (as thier first two albums wernt)music really cant hold my atention, or a place in my cd player.  Some of the songs on this album will grow on you but you really should get sinister, thier early eps and tigermilk first.  This album is worth owning but only if your serios about B&amp;S

0962477060|5.0|This is the book to have if you play guitar.  I am a guitar teacher and this book transforms the guitar into something perfectly logical and simple.  If you are confused by the fretboard and how chords/scales/improv fit together you need this book!  The CAGED sequence presented is so incredibly helpful for soloing.  Just get this book ok?  I have tried a ton of other books, but this book I continually have open and use.  I could write more, but it basically comes down to this, I love this book and use it non-stop.  I recommend it to all my guitar friends.

0871137380|5.0|Anyone that has gotten upset at the news or has asked the question, &quot;Why do we (the USA) need to be involved with that?&quot; should read this book. Bowden explains the double edge edge sword of super power and peace keeper very graphically and very well. There is no other country that can currently keep the bullies of the world on a leash but us.<br />Is the book patriotic? Without doubt. Is the book emotional? Most of the time. Is it fair? It tries. If you have any patriotic fire at all this book will excite you and upset you. It will leave you with more understanding why our youth has to spill it's blood in a foreign land and how we as a nation have nothing but hard choices to make in the future as current events have shown. <br />This book should be a mandatory read for those of draft age and anyone that has ever wondered why need to be in a world's far corner tapping on a bully's shoulder.

0684853523|4.0|Stephen King is one of the worlds most recognised authors of the 20th/21st century. 'On Writing' is King sharing with you some of the memorable moments of his life which would eventually lead him to pen the vast amounts of best-sellers he has. Also sharing 'tips' in writing style that could help make you a better writer. Ending with an account of his accident which nearly killed him.<br />Set out in three parts. The first deals with Kings past with memoirs from his childhood right up to his current life. You will find this part extrememly hilarious. King's sense of humour shines through making you totally enrapt in his life adventures.<br />The second part, 'On Writing', deals with how the reader should go about writing a story/novel. This is very interesting even if you're not planning on doing any writing, but for any budding writers it should be thought of as some sort of secret bible. Everything he tells you is in a conversational and humourous tone and does not come across like a boring text-book.<br />The third part deals with his accident and his amazing recovery. He sounds a bit bitter about this - I wonder why?<br />This book is recommended, not only to budding writers, but to everyone. It will instill hope into you alongside an incredibly entertaining read. Best read in a long time!!!!

B00003CXI1|4.0|First of all, I'd like to establish that I AM a Harry Potter fan. I've read all of the the books more times than I can remember (or care to admit). I of course, when I heard the news that there was to be a HP movie was interested, but wary that such a project could be successful. Then it was discovered that J.K. Rowling herself would be a big influence in the filming. Eventually the movie was done and released to the world. It was a interesting movie, but ultimatly came far short of the books.<br />Most book-to-movie adaptations result in a dumbing down of the plot. That did not happen here, the movie is roughly two and a half hours long. But it loses the, for lack of a better term, magic of the books. Flying on broomsticks for example: in your mind it you can see people sifting their weight when they change in direction, but is lost when putting on film. Nit-picky maybe but it all adds up. The casting was a mixed bag: some characters were spot on (Hagrid), while others...?(Dumbledore-was worried he would fall over dead before the end of the film. What happened to funny, alive, brilliant if a bit mad Dumbledore that rules?!)Also, the special effects were,frankly, not very good.  <BR>What kills this movie,though, is that stays close to the book only at points that advance the plot(mostly).And even then it would have seem confusing had I not read the books (example: Nicholis Flamel) Much developement and interaction that you really could relate to in the books was gone. This is a movie with it's heart removed.<BR>I did still enjoy it to a certain degree. Mr. Olivander was great, so was Madam Hooch. It had a good DVD transfer and has good sound quality. The extras are average to decent with a good if short documentury with the filmmakers. <BR>Still, a decent companion to the books that doesn't ruin them(if that can be done :) and worth the money of HP fans. But stands shaky on it's own, especially if you haven't read the books.

B0000524CY|4.0|I rented 'The Version You've Never Seen' a few weeks ago, and watched it during broad daylight! It still scared the hell out of me! Aside from a slow start, this movie is unbelievable; the fact that a film as old as this can still be so terrifying. I enjoyed the 'version never before seen' since it included scenes not found in the original theater version, like the notorious 'spider-walk' down the staircase! <BR>While 'The Exorcist' is by no means for everyone(when she's doing *SOMETHING* with a crucifix, it can get a bit rough, to say the least!), it is an incredible film, sure to put the fear of God in you! Enjoy!

B00003CXSP|4.0|1) On the second disc, go to &quot;Breaking The Scilence&quot;. Then highlight Music, push the left key on your remote and you will see two highlighted arrows. Select the arrows this will lead you to a musical montage of Clarice Starling. <br />2) Put disk two in your DVD player and go to the 'DVD Credits'. On the eighth page (hit 'more' seven times). I believe one of the names on the page is 'Wes Sewell', so look for that. On that page there are some odditites in the menu system. Typically the menu options can be triggered both by scrolling to an option and hitting enter as well as hitting the number key that corresponds to it's order in the menu. In this instance hitting four is the same as hitting one (back to the main menu) and five just seems to highlight that option. But if you hit five and then scroll down six times, then to the left six times and down again six times it will open up a picture collage. There are other movements that will activate it, but that one was the first I was able to reproduce successfully. Basically you can just scroll off the option either up or down and then make some repeated movements in several directions and stumble across it. Now does anyone know who the hell the guy in the photo's is??? For all this trouble I assume he's pretty important... maybe an author or screenwriter?
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I've seen my fair share of period romances and I think this movie just about blows the rest out the water.  It's certainly a great deal better than the over-hyped Sense and Sensibility (1995) and Pride and Prejudice (1996).  Everything about this movie is a thumb up.  I don't understand why people have problems with the cast, the story, or the music.  The leads are definitely not the regular Hollywood types, but that only makes them that much more believable.  I think this production is the finest showing of ensemble acting I've seen.  The script is a rather faithful rendering of Austen's novel (e.g., 90% of the dialogue comes straight from the book) and so I don't understand why some people say that they like Persuasion, the novel, but find problems with this part or that part of the story of the movie.  And the music is by the Romantic period composer, Chopin -- enough said.<br />This is not a movie to watch just once.  In this regard, it's like a book.  I watched it several times before I was able to pick up on how effectively the relationship between Anne and Frederick is juxtaposed against the various other relationships in the movie.<br />I read the novel subsequent to watching the movie, and I found no jarring differences in the stories of the two mediums, with the exception of Mr. Elliot and Mrs. Smith.  The book presents Mr. Elliot far more critical light.  And I think Austen's alternate ending was very well integrated into the movie.  The brains behind the movie really did their homework in selecting the cast and condensing the novel to a script that still retains much of the nuances of the novel.

B00005PJ6M|2.0|Bill and Ted are a little older now and so their naive, dumb personnas don't work as well as the first time around.  The Station character is non-non-heinous and seems totally out of place.

0312265859|5.0|I patiently wait for each Janet Evanovich book to come out.  As soon as I heard the new one was coming out I quickly read my current book so that I was ready to start my next Stephanie Plum adventure.  I was not disappointed after my long wait.  I think this book is exactly what Stephanie Plum fans are looking for.  It is witty, funny and has plenty of car explosions.  It is a book you can read in one sitting whether it be at the beach or on your couch.  I definitely recommend this book to all Stephanie Plum fans as well as new readers of the series.  Even though this is the 8th novel in the series Evanovich gives the new reader enough background to get caught up.  Enjoy!!

B00005JKBC|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie!!! Robert Redford is Nathan Muir, a CIA agent about to retire. His protege, Tom Bishop[Brad Pitt], is thrown into a prison and will be executed within 24 hours. Muir cunningly sets up an operation to get Bishop out. This is an action-packed, thrilling, suspenseful movie! It's very accurate in its portrayal of the CIA. I HIGHLY recommend this movie! I was not a major fan of action thrillers, but after I watched Spy Game, I was amazed! This movie is awesome...watch it now!!!!

B00000J2SR|3.0|when i was a little tyke, i loved RAINBOW, especially albums<br />like RISING AND LONG LIVE ROCK-N-ROLL. Now that i'm a nearly<br />middle aged man, i find alot of their earlier stuff kind of<br />silly! Their first album is probably my favorite and contains<br />such great tunes as SELF PORTRAIT and STILL I'M SAD. By BENT OUT<br />OF SHEEP, RAINBOW had for the most part dropped all that medieval<br />stuff and had turned into a FOREIGNER like AOR progressive pop<br />metal outfit. BENT OUT OF SCOPE isn't a great album, but it<br />does contain at least two great tunes. STREET OF DREAMS is one of<br />RAINBOW'S better pop songs and became a big hit for them. My<br />favorite song here is the atmospheric, synthesizer laden instru-<br />mental SNOWMAN. This is a wonderfully sad, melodic song and quite<br />unlike anything they'd done before. This song alone is worth<br />buying the album for. The rest of this isn't quite as spectacu-<br />lar, but it's not [junk], either. STRANDED is on okay song, as is<br />CAN'T LET YOU GO and the band shows that they can still rock up<br />a snowstorm on cuts like DRINKING WITH THE DEVIL and MAKE YOUR<br />MOVE. JOE LYNN TURNER sings his lungs out on this, even if he<br />does sound a bit too much like LOU GRAMM at times, tho' I LIKE<br />LOU GRAMM's voice! FIRE DANCE isn't that convincing and FOOL FOR<br />THE NIGHT is nothing to write home from jail about, but I still<br />like this album. really...i dew.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink's album is just the thing to get you going in the morning, accompany you on a morning jog, help you last during bus rides, car rides, or study halls, wind you down at night, and get your parties started. From fast to slow, upbeat to downcast, and great to better, this album has it all. The tunes, lyrics, and of course Pink's voice are all really good, and this is an album I for one would definitely recommend.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Mulholland Drive is really one of the best movies of 2001. I'll admit at first, i too was a bit confused, to see the film only once will not do it justice. I ended up seeing it again and finally solved this puzzle. The movie is a tragedy of dreams and hopes gon wrong. You must give the film a second chance. It's really not that complicated, you must pay careful attention and you can will understand it too. Most of the film is simple enough until the two main characters open up the blue box. After this point in the film carefully watch it. Most of it towards th end is basically flashblacks and it jumps around somewhat. Just follow it careful and you will understand why this film has been so highly acclaimed as it has been. Once you figured it all out, you will see how a tragic and sad tale it all was. Please, please do yourself a favor and watch it and if you didnt understand it, watch once more....its all worth it!!!
6300273199|4.0|I think that this is the most poverful Bon Scott era video I have ever seen. Angus young is in great form. I JUST LOVE it when he gets into all of his spasms on stage. Angus also shakes his head all over the place constantly. I loved all of the songs especially an in your face version of Bad Boy Boogie as well as a great solo from Angus just before the end of Rocker. Bon is in great form and I loved their versions of Sin City and Hell Ain't a Bad Place To Be. But I would rather see them perform instead of conducting interviews.
B000066NW0|5.0|Awesome. Incredible. Ear-pleasing. There are many words that can describe Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go.&quot; This album is a compilation of Avril's feelings, emotions, thoughts, ideas, and life. She expresses the many sides of herself in her variation of songs, like &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; &quot;Sk8er Boi,&quot; &quot;I'm With You,&quot; &quot;Too Much To Ask,&quot; and the remaining songs. Despite the variety of sounds, the album is extremely catchy and fun to listen to. Every time I start to play the CD, I can never stop listening until I've heard all 48 wonderful minutes of it. This album appeals to a wide audience and is proving to be a popular item. Also, it must be mentioned that Avril's vocals on the album are outstanding. They are amazingly strong and powerful. In addition to Avril's sometimes soothing, sometimes angry voice, the instrumental components of the songs prove the other half the album's greatness. All the tracks are mixed with perfection to make them so addicting. And if all that wasn't good enough, all these rhymes and lyrics are written by Avril herself. She doesn't allow her music to come from anybody else but herself. You can just feel her defiance and individuality through her songs. She's proven herself as a guitarist, singer, and writer. This album is a perfect mix of Avril's talents. I recommend this album to those who just want to hear good quality music. True to her heart, this album is a wonderful piece of work.

Jimi proved to the world that day who was the boss. No one played gutar with their teeth better that he did. Also no one decided to set their guitar on fire, But he Did! They had no idea who Jimi Hndrix was, but he cut them all down to size!
B000002L68|5.0|This was the 1st album that got me listening to Prince, and it's still my favorite album of his and one of my favorite albums of all time. The lyrics are interesting and fun at times, but contemplative and melancholy in others. <br />Hey I've got a fact for you. Did you know the lyrics in \\"Darling Nikki\\" were what supposedly inspired Tipper Gore to start her music censorship campaign? Interesting, eh?<br />Although I love the movie, the soundtrack is definately timeless with Prince 80s sound coming through full force. This was when Prince was at his best musically and creatively. <br />1) \\"Let's Go Crazy\\" - Compelling opening. Upbeat song. One of Prince's most popular.<BR>2) \\"Take Me with U\\" - One of my personal favorites. Features Apollonia. I love the lyrics \\"I don't care where we go/I don't care what we do/ I don't care pretty baby/ Just take me with u\\". <BR>3) \\"The Beautiful Ones\\" - this song is the best of Prince's...EVER. This song oozes with emotion. He asks \\"Do you want him/ or do you want me/ cuz I want u\\". Just so powerful and beautiful. Always makes me think of the movie.<BR>4)\\"Computer Blue\\" - another favorite. The instrumental part of this song is amazing and magical. I can't explain it but it always grabs me and I have to stop what I'm doing and just listen.<BR>5) \\"Darling Nikki\\" - another emotional song. \\"Come back Nikki, come back.\\" In the movie, he's very sarcastic with a song that when played on the album, sounds like he's obsessed with Nikki. The electic guitars kick [rear]. Also there's a freaky hidden message at the end of the song that in order for you to hear it, you have to play an LP version backwards.<BR>6) \\"When Doves Cry\\" - Surely you know this song.<BR>7) \\"I Would Die 4 U\\" - so much energy and just really catchy pop.<BR>8) \\"Baby I'm a Star\\" - Prince tells you what he is here. It's good stuff. The hidden message at the beginning sounds kind of freaky because it's in your face but other than that I love Prince's confidence.<BR>9) \\"Purple Rain\\" - You must have been living in a hole if you haven't heard this song.<br />Overall, you are in for a wild ride. You will love this album if you love rock/r&b/pop sounding songs with good beats, and catchy lyrics. Do not wait like I did to purchase this album, even if you are just beginning to get into Prince!!

B00005OM4N|3.0|Okay, okay, I'll admit it. I do as much \\"Britney-bashing\\" as the next person, but I own every one of her CDs. The reason? Britney is pure Pop. She appeals to the masses with her catchy songs. <BR>Her voice is less than stellar (to put it mildly). But hey, that doesn't seem to matter these days.<br />By now you are wondering, why then should I buy this album?! Well, if you liked her previous stuff, if you've liked the singles from this album, (even if you PRETEND not to like her), buy the album. I think she's trying to mature with her sound here, and that's definately good. On the \\"Oops\\" album, EVERY track sounded the same, but on this album, the tracks are more different and unique (however there is the staple \\"britney sound\\" in most songs).<br />Especially good are \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Anticipating\\" (VERY Janet Jackson,& a step in the right direction), \\"Cinderella\\", and What It's Like to Be Me\\" (this song features Justin Timberlake and it's the most original and funkiest track on the album).<br />I think this album is a C+. Heck, maybe it's even a B-, especially if you are judging from her prior efforts.

B00005QDW1|5.0|I'm a self-proclaimed 80's enthusiast, so imagine my suprise when I go to pick up one of my favorite group's albums and find they are experimenting with 80s sounds. Now, I can understand how some No Doubt fans may not like this album because its very different from their previous work. But if you like danceable, upbeat, interesting music, you will LOVE this CD! Trust me! <br />Gwen Stefani sounds INCREDIBLE! She experiments with her vocals on this album and sings with the likes of Prince. I love all of the lyrics and all of the sounds and beats. There is so much energy on this album, it's incredible.<br />&quot;Return of Saturn&quot; was wonderful too, but most songs were melancholy. This album is mainly fun, with some contemplative tracks that still keep the energy.<br />This is the perfect album to listen to if you are happy, and even if you are in a funk, jam to this!<br />My personal faves: Hella Good, Hey Baby, Making Out, Detective, Don't Let Me Down, In My Head, Platinum Blonde Life, and Waiting Room (the BEST song on the album).<br />I was not a Prince fan until I fell in love with &quot;Waiting Room&quot;. Now I'm hardcore Prince. Check out his stuff also. He has been a big influence on Gwen and No Doubt!

6304711875|5.0|This has to be the definitive horror film of the 1990's. Although it was influenced by many slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's (HALLOWEEN, PROM NIGHT, FRIDAY THE 13TH, etc) it still remains a fresh new horror film in it's own right. It brings the quality that all of the old slasher films,(people getting killed left, right and centre, by someone in a mask and a really big knife) along with many of it's own. Namely it's comedy.<br />The direction is good from Craven, but it is helped immensely from Kevin Williamson's witty script. The perfomances throughout are very strong, but it's Jamie Kennedy as movie geek Randy who comes up trumps, stealing all the prime lines from the leading lady Neve Campbell. <br />Scream 2 and 3 don't even come to close to this masterpiece.  Like Jamie Lee Curtis once said &quot;the original is always best&quot;.<br />It has been imitated several times in the years that followed namely I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!, VALENTINE and HALLOWEEN H:20. But these films have never been quiet able to recreate the magic of SCREAM.

B000065U1N|5.0|Very detailed depiction of a real battle.  The action was outstanding.  Some scenes are unforgettable.  Great movie!
0060930349|1.0|History means objectivity. This book is full of subjective statements about facts, wrong or inexistent documentation in many of its assertions, and a clear bias in its writing. Paul Johnson tries to convince us that the History of the U.S. has been a difficult journey with a magical, divine end. Statements like 'for the first time in human history', 'the most important achievement of mankind', 'unknown in the rest of the world' abound.<br />I was looking forward to finishing the book already after twenty pages. I would rather call this book 'Stories of the American people'. Let us be serious.<br />I recommend the book as a good background reading before watching 'Independence day', or as a complement of Henry Kissinger's memoirs.
B000005QH3|5.0|Without a doubt,the most electrifying film of the last centuary.Full of compassion,pain,sorrow,fun and a determination of one man to complete his task,knowing that in the end it was all hopeless and insignificant.The acting,the power,the sheer credibility of the storey,it all added up to a brilliant and well acted film,in which you believed in the charactors and a mans heartfelt dedication to his work.The direction,the belivibility of all in this film made it one of the most successful of its time,I personally feel that the action and entertainment value of this film will be hard to excel.
B00005B36H|4.0|The music on this album is far more complex and more in-depth than 99 percent of modern rock music (and thousands of times moreso than the likes of Blink 182, Nickelback, etc.). However, the music can get so compex at times that the enjoyment of listening to it drops, at least for me. You're sitting there listening to a song you know is more original and creative than most modern music... but how much can you enjoy it? It depends on the song for me...<br />The Grudge: heavy but reserved at the same time, this track is quite long (as are many others) and unless you listen carefully seems to go nowhere for its several minute span. There are some tempo changes and rhythm changes, but basically the same &quot;melody&quot; all the way through. I haven't yet become attached to this song (enjoy it all the way through), but I do like its general atmosphere.<br />Eon Blue Apocalypse: Instrumental track, prelude to the next track.<br />The Patient: An epic track that has yet to impress me. The lyrics are not only difficult to hear, but difficult to interpret even when you &quot;cheat&quot; and use a lyrics sheet. I'm sure this will grow on some people, though.<br />Mantra: very spooky but short interlude between &quot;The Patient&quot; and the album's hit single. The frightening atmosphere created by the sound effects fit well in this track's place.<br />Schism: anyone listening to modern rock radio undoubtably heard this song countless times in the later half of 2001. One of the more &quot;accessible&quot; and immediately enjoyable songs on the album for sure. An odd beat is used, and this is a very original and very likeable song.<br />Parabol: A very soft but gloomy-sounding introduction to the next track. Maynard seems to mutter quietly, especially during the first half. He then summarizes the verses of &quot;Parabola&quot; at the end of this song in a much more subtle tone than in the next track.<br />Parabola: My favorite track on the album. An all-around excellent song. The buildup of &quot;Parabol&quot; leads right into the heavy introduction to this song. This is probably the heaviest song on the album, yet it sounds beautiful and melodic. This is getting some airplay, believe it or not, despite its epic feel and mood changes (contrasting sharply with current 3-minute rock hits from Default and Nickelback).<br />Ticks &amp; Leeches - a song full of extreme anger (the opening line is Maynard screaming an explative in an extremely distorted voice). Rather long and a little complex, but fairly accessible.<br />Lateralis - this one is up with &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Parabola&quot; as one of the more accessible and melodic songs, and I believe I heard this song one time on my local radio station -- though considering its 9-minute length, I'm sure it was trimmed down severely. The chorus's line &quot;over-thinking, overanalyzing, separates the body from the mind...&quot; seems to echo throughout.<br />Disposition - a song with barely any lyrics, this seems like an interlude and lasts too long for being one. Weighing in at five minutes -- more than your average &quot;regular&quot; rock track -- this seems overdone, but like all the songs on here, lends to the depressing and gloomy mood. The funky drumming at the end of the track flows straight into the next track.<br />Reflection - extremely long and epic! By the time Maynard's first words are uttered, enough time has passed for a Weezer song on the radio to have played twice. It takes a real attention span to listen to this all the way through... if you're taking a long trip in the car, you can enjoy this, but if you're just kind of &quot;hanging out,&quot; don't bother listening to this. However, this may be the most well-written song on the album with so many changes and the electronic effect on Maynard's voice is very well-done.<br />Triad - just when you thought the album was coming to a close (ever since &quot;Parabola,&quot; the songs have become more mellow), the main portion of this song explodes in your face. The longest instrumental piece on the CD, this is nine minutes in length. If you're listening to this album for radio-friendly songs, you should've stopped way back at &quot;Lateralis,&quot; because this isn't one, and the next track is far from it.<br />Faaip De Oiad - the most thoroughly frightening track on the CD, and it contains no music, other than extremely odd drumming... otherwise, you hear a hysterical man on a phone explaining that the government knows that aliens are going to invade and aren't doing anything about it. The man's hysterical crying during the conversation combines with an electronic noise and out-of-this-world drumming to be very haunting and unusual.<br />Summary :: I recommend the disc to any modern rock fan. People who already enjoy more subtle and complex music like Radiohead will immediately take a liking to the music on here, while the rest of us will gradually learn to appreciate the more complex tracks while rocking out to &quot;Schism&quot; and &quot;Parabola.&quot;
0140288503|5.0|I'm an avid reader of military fiction and non-fiction, but I have never read such a compelling story.  If this were fiction, the pure selflessness of these soldiers and operators would have been too amazing to believe.  This is a must read, especially if you have any interest in the military, stories of heroism, or the pride and commitment that leads some people to give up their lives to save others.  Astonishing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Formula for a relaxing evening:  a comfy chair, a nice hot cup of chai or jasmine tea, some sort of snacks, a good comic book, and some Norah Jones playing on the stereo.  Sit back and let the evening go.<br />The daughter that sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar ignored proves that she can make it on her own.  The fourteen songs on her debut album Come Away With Me are a melodic fusion of jazz, blues, and folk (in that order) and easily at home on the CD changer along with Shawn Colvin, Sade, and other such artists.<br />Smoky, gentle, smooth, and warm--that's how I describe her voice.  I find it hard to compare her voice to anyone else, so that shows how special she is.  In a song punctuated by her piano, such as the title ballad, a mixture of slow jazz with tinges of country, her voice is the star.  Whether accompanied by piano or acoustic guitar, she succeeds in not being overdominated by the instruments and comes full front, singing, wrapping the melodies of the instruments around her.<br />&quot;Seven Years,&quot; a sweet number featuring Norah, an acoustic guitar, and a sitar-sounding National guitar, is my favorite song here.  It's a tender portrait of a seven-year old girl, who's &quot;Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song/A little girl with nothing wrong/And she's all alone.&quot;<br />Second place goes to the title track, which is the perfect example of her eclectic mix.  It's also a nice romantic song of going away with someone somewhere, whether it be a mountaintop or a field with knee-high yellow grass.<br />Other noteworthy songs:  she gives a nice bluesy-jazz flavor to Hank Williams' &quot;Cold Cold Heart.&quot;  &quot;Feelin' The Same Way&quot; is the least slow song here, but that's because of the slightly quicker tempo of the drums.  &quot;Turn Me On&quot; is another jazz-country ballad that I can't picture any country singers covering without messing it up with their shrill voices.  &quot;Painter Song&quot; is classic cafe midnight jazz staple.  Ditto for &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; with its &quot;Now you know&quot; refrain.  Her voice is at its most potent here.<br />Most of the songs clock in anywhere from two-and-a-half minutes to three-and-a-half minutes on average and are thus bite-sized nuggets of that warm you up inside.<br />This is one of those rare, one in a blue moon (or is that blue note) special albums that come once in a while and takes your breath away.  Come Away With You?  Any day, Norah.  Just give me the word and I'll be ready.  Let me fix some chai first..  Ditto for &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; with its &quot;Now you know&quot; refrain.

0807282375|3.0|First, I would like to say that I am thirteen years old, and have a pretty decent understanding of what's going on in the world. I have read all of His Dark Materials books, The Golden Compass, in my opinion, being the best. It was full of life and spark, introducing us to a world just enough like ours to engage us, but just different enough to keep us on our toes. It was well-written and quickly paced, and Pullman's ingenuity made reading it fun. The Subtle Knife was less enjoyable. The appearance of Will, a great character, and of Mary Malone kept me going, but the book seemed tired, and the Ci'Gazze (I still don't quite know how to pronouce that. Chih-GAH-tzay? Chi-GAH-zee? Chi-GAHZ?) world was dry and, in my humble opinion, uninteresting. The Amber Spyglass was worse. The worlds were frenetic, with odd quirks that are shadowy mockeries of the interesting qualities that made Lyra's world interesting in The Golden Compass, and each character, once so three-dimensional, becomes a paper doll, representing a characteristic: Will is bravery, Lyra is devotion, Mrs. Coulter (once so engaging as the perfect villain) becomes overemphasized maternal warmth, etc., etc. I didn't notice this the first time I read the book. I was too caught up with the \\"Let's kill God and the Church\\" theme to notice the aforementioned flaws. <BR> <BR> I don't think my religion is important for the sake of this review, so I'll simply say that I am a religious person. I'm sure that will keep some of you reading this next bit, even though you might take me to task for it, and I accept that. I think of this book as being awfully positive, in the \\"God\\" sense. What dies during the climactic (if slightly frantic) battle near the book's end is not \\"God the creator, God the teacher,\\" but two other versions of that supreme being: God the deceiver (in the death of the decrepit Authority) and God the killer (in Metatron's fall into oblivion). These, one might note, are two hats that just about every formof organized religion (not just the Catholic Church) have placed on God, during the Inquisition, the Salem Witch Trials, and the Holocaust. However, as the African King Ogunwe says to Mrs. Coulter, the Authority is just an angel, not a god, and that they don't know whether or not there was a creator. I like to think that there was. <BR> <BR> Also, Pullman's work sometimes becomes, for lack of a better word, prophetic, though I hesitate to say it that way. Talking with Father MacPhail, Ms. Coulter says that she would not surrender Lyra to the care of the priests because they are obsessed with \\"sexuality\\" and she can't imagine their \\"dirty fingernails\\" prying all over her daughter. This sounds just like the Catholic Church's scandal over abusive priests. I wonder what Mr. Pullman thinks about that.<BR> <BR> So, here is my recommendation to you: read the first two \\"His Dark Materials\\" books in the traditional way, on paper, and then get the audio version of The Amber Spyglass. You will not regret it. This is a great recording, with a great cast, and even Pullman sometimes lays the detailed exposition on a little thick, it is easy to get through when listening to the tapes, and, if nothing else, Pullman is an excellent storyteller, and his work, when spoken aloud, is magical.<BR> <BR> Finally, here is my last request, and this is of Amazon.com. Please do not group Mr. Pullman's books with The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Not all books listed as \\"Young Adult/Teen\\" are equal, and as a marketing ploy your grouping doesn't work because the books cater to two utterly completely different audiences.
B000000WFZ|5.0|This is it. Morricone's best soundtrack, and to me one of the best of all soundtracks. How far have we come from the first Morricone's soundtracks (A fistful of dollars, the Good the Bad the Ugly,etc.). A soothing, relaxing and inspirational music that can provide food for every soul. I can hardly think of an experience in this life that can bring you closer to heaven, than listening to this CD in a relaxed mood. Or, for that matter, that can make oneself reconcile with earth, precisely when  stress and the pressures of modern life are about to overcome any meningful effort to attribute a sense to existence..<br />If you can relate with these needs, buy this CD and just listen to &quot;On Earth as it is in Heaven&quot;. The joy and peace that ensue, will thoroughly and completely justify the small investment. It is a pity that we cannot get the movie on CD yet.
6305358613|5.0|Shekar Kapur's account of the early years of Elizabeth I's reign in not your average costume drama, it is a visceral and entrancing film that despite all the historical inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted (and they are many), perfectly captures the climate of religious conflict, struggle for power and constant danger that characterised the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. Michael Hirst's script portrays the young queen as an innocent caught in the throes of international politics, who by the end of the film has become a calculating monarch willing to sacrifice almost anything to ensure her survival and the welfare and prosperity of her kingdom. Kapur's brilliant direction gives the film a vertiginous rhythm, while Remi Adefarasin's ominous cinematography adds a menacing and sinister atmosphere that sometimes gives Elizabeth the feel of a horror movie. Also worthy of praise are the magnificent production design, the gorgeous costumes and a surprisingly eclectic soundtrack that includes Byrd, Mozart, Holst and Elgar as well as some great original music.<br />The acting is also excellent. Especially Geoffrey Rush as the unscrupulous yet reliable Walsingham; Christopher Eccleston as the devious Duke of Norfolk; Richard Attenborough as Cecil, Elizabeth's most loyal and trusted aide; and Kathy Burke as the frustrated and paranoid &quot;Bloody Mary&quot;. However, the real jewel is Cate Blanchett's amazing, star-making turn as the title character. She gives a complex, mesmerising and moving performance as she makes the transition from scared and vulnerable young woman to quasi-preternatural icon.<br />If you are interested in the &quot;true historical facts&quot; of Elizabeth's reign you should choose a documentary of one of the many great books that have been written about her (my favourite is Alison Weir's biography), but if you are looking for a great cinematic experience that explores the young queen's personality and motivations in remarkable depth this is definitely the one to choose. In my opinion Shekar Kapur's masterpiece is the best film of its kind.

B00005LMBK|5.0|At a time in which pop music keeps getting safer and more predictable, this is a dazzling example of what a few talented artists can accomplish. The Gorillaz have managed to create something that is innovative, irreverent, unpredictable, and yes, very eclectic. I know the word &quot;eclectic&quot; is used to describe almost anything nowadays and has become somewhat devalued, but if this album isn't eclectic I don't know what is. This is a bold and experimental mix of pop, hip-hop, Latin and techno and each song is a mini-masterpiece completely different from the others. Just the intention to make something so different and stray from the beaten path would make this CD worthy of praise, but when it's done so brilliantly you simply have to admire the sheer talent and inventiveness these musicians have.

Not very like his past efforts, yet his hand is evident.<br />Lynch has always been fascinated with texture, long drawn out closeups of normal surfaces, and there is that (the corn fields, the highway).  There are (mildly) quirky characters and incidents (the deer lady; the repairman brothers -- one with an unusual bandage, of sorts, on his chin).  There are otherwise normal characters carrying dark secrets (the vets discussing World War 2).<br />And while Lynch has always been fascinated with the dark secrets beneath Middle America, he's also long evinced a genuine love for Middle America.  His tales tend to be about innocents who are attracted and drawn into darkness, yet they are at the same time genuinely innocent.  And Lynch has never mocked them for their innocence, just as he does not mock them for their quirks.<br />The Straight Story emphasizes this softer side of Lynch -- his love of Middle American innocence -- but that's always been an element of his work, albeit under-emphasized in Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet.<br />Likewise, Lynch's longtime music collaborator, Angelo Badalamenti, creates a score that's also softer yet typical of Badelamenti's work.<br />The Straight Story is masterpiece that stands on its own, but it remains a Lynchian masterpiece.

0064407667|5.0|This is the rare children's book that will probably... er, definitely be enjoyed more by adults than by children. It's true, the story of the Baudelaire children is depressing, but once you get passed that, Snicket has a Douglas Adams-like wit which results in a lot of dark humor. There's also a good supply of plot twists to keep anyone over 12 occupied. The kids emerge alright in this one and survive to move onto another story. What will happen in the next book? I don't know, but no doubt it will be filled with doom and gloom and impossible situations that the Baudelair orphans will escape by their wits for a short time before their next terrfying ordeal begins.<br />Lemony Snicket is actually Daniel Handler, by the way. I saw him play his accordion with the Magnetic Fields in concert once, and you'd never expect something this good from some guy in the background. Good job, Daniel.
B000060P79|5.0|this cd is truly one of the best.  all the songs are really catchy, and it's a well put together album.  i had a chance to see these guys in concert and they blew me away!  you can tell that they really love what they do, and they show it in their songs, which is awesome.  i totally recommend  going out and buying this album right now!!!
0312265859|5.0|I bought this book at noon but had to go to work so I didn't get started on it until about 10:30pm, but I was up until I finished it.  I don't want to give too much away, since it is a mystery in a way.  But it has all the classic Stephanie Plum elements: Ranger, Joe, Blown up Cars, and of course a couple of bad guys.<br />For those of you who haven't read the Stephanie Plus series, start at the beginning and work your way up.  There are references to past books.<br />Stephanie's character is personable and understandable.  She lives a normal live, basically.  I mean, if you were a bond enforcement person how normal can your life really be?
006097625X|5.0|I like to take things apart and figure out how they work, except instead of doing internal combustion engines or pocket watches I like to play with books, movies and television shows.  In \\"Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art,\\" Scott McCloud not only takes apart comic books, he puts them back together again.  Certainly comics are a neglected art form.  Put Superman, Batman, Spawn and Spider-Man on the big screen and there will be some cursory comments about the actual all-in-color-for-a-dime, and names like Stan Lee and Frank Miller will get kicked around, but nobody really talks about how comics work (the exception that proves the rule would be the Hughes brothers talking about adapting the \\"From Hell\\" graphic novels).  Part of the problem is conceptual vocabulary: we can explain in excruciating detail how the shower scene in \\"Psycho\\" works in terms of shot composition, montage, scoring, etc.  That sort of conceptual vocabulary really does not exist and McCloud takes it upon himself to pretty much create it from scratch.<br />That, of course, is an impressive achievement, especially since he deals with functions as well as forms.  To that we add McCloud's knowledge of art history, which allows him to go back in time and find the origins of comics in pre-Columbian picture manuscripts, Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Bayeux Tapestry.  Topping all of this off is McCloud's grand and rather obvious conceit, that his book about the art of comic books is done AS a comic book.  This might seem an obvious approach, but that does not take away from the fact that the result is a perfect marriage of substance and form.<br />This volume is divided into nine chapters: (1) Setting the Record Straight, which develops a proper dictionary-style definition of \\"comics\\"; (2) The Vocabulary of Comics, detailing the iconic nature of comic art; (3) Blood in the Gutter, establishing the different types of transitions between frames of comic art, which are the building blocks of how comics work; (4) Time Frames, covers the ways in which comics manipulate time, including depictions of speed and motion; (5) Living in Line, explores how emotions and other things are made visible in comics; (6) Show and Tell, looks at the interchangeability of words and pictures in various combinations; (7) The Six Steps, details the path comic book creators take in moving from idea/purpose to form to idiom to structure to craft to surface (but not necessarily in that order); (8) A Word About Color, reminds us that even though this particular book is primarily in black & white, color has its uses in comic books; and (9) Putting It All Together, finds McCloud getting philosophical about the peculiar place of comic books in the universe.<br />\\"Understanding Comics\\" works for both those who are reading pretty much every comic book done by anyone on the face of the planet and those who have never heard of Wil Eisner and Art Spigelman, let alone recognize their artwork.  Which ever end of the spectrum you gravitate towards McCloud incorporates brief examples of some of the artwork of the greatest comic book artists, such as Kirby, Herge, Schultz, etc., as well as work by more conventional artists, including Rembrandt, Hokusai, and Van Gogh.  \\"Understanding Comics\\" is a superb look at the form and functions of the most underexplored art form in popular culture.<br />I am using Spider-Man comic books in my Popular Culture class this year and will be using some of McCloud's key points to help the cherubs in their appreciation of what they are reading.  If you have devoted hundreds of hours of your life to reading comic books, then you can take a couple of hours to go through this book and have a better understanding and appreciation of why you take funny books so seriously.ics work; (4) Time Frames, covers the ways in which comics manipulate time, including depictions of speed and motion; (5) Living in Line, explores how emotions and other things are made visible in comics; (6) Show and Tell, looks at the interchangeability of words and pictures in various combinations; (7) The Six Steps, details the path comic book creators take in moving from idea/purpose to form to idiom to structure to craft to surface (but not necessarily in that order); (8) A Word About Color, reminds us that even though this particular book is primarily in black & white, color has its uses in comic books; and (9) Putting It All Together, finds McCloud getting philosophical about the peculiar place of comic books in the universe.<br />\\"Understanding Comics\\" works for both those who are reading pretty much every comic book done by anyone on the face of the planet and those who have never heard of Wil Eisner and Art Spigelman, let alone recognize their artwork.

6305090564|4.0|Everybody dies you know. Especially in this hilarious movie about a cruise ship that is eaten by a giant squid. Who can stop this squid? Treat Williams, YES! He was incredible in \\"The Phantom\\" another masterpiece and he proves himself in this movie. Axes to the face, ladies getting sucked into toilets and crazy guys puking into buckets are some of the funny highlights in this Stephen Sommers epic. Just when you think this movie can't get any better, they throw in Famke Janssen, the most beautiful lordess ever and you have the ultimate movie. I was enlightened after watching this movie.

B0000542DH|4.0|Oliver Stone's most controversial picture to date. The bizarre story about two lovers named Mickey and Mallory show the country their love for each other and their urge to kill. Crazy! Both had horrible childhoods involving child abuse. Written by Quentin Tarantino, the film revolves around Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis who play the couple and their encounters with 'sane' people. Their minds are on overload with flashes of their inner demons. As they kill more people, they gain more attention. A reckless cop (Tom Sizemore) is on the lookout for them and so is the selfish newsreporter (Robert Downey Jr.). When the two are caught, the reporter wants to have an exclusive interview with Mickey during a Superbowl halftime. Can you imagine the ratings? You should see what happens to his hand and to him at the end of the movie, vengeance for the non-stop talking, dude! All hell breaks loose and it's caught on camera. Another killing spree and the two escape. The movie points out how the media pushes the envelope and exposes the violent nature of human beings. That is all they are concerned about and it's for the ratings. Although the movie has a trippy look to it, its message is well delivered. It could give you a headache with the amount of brutal violence (my head swelled up) and the craziness that every character goes through besides the couple. Tommy Lee Jones plays a psychotic prison warden and Rodney Dangerfield of all people, plays Mallory's abusive father. Those two sure know how to make funny faces. Harrelson and Lewis give their best performances and Stone's risk-taking direction was worth it. Hypnotic picture!
0312265859|4.0|Always a fan of Stephanie and company, I couldn't wait to settle in and read this one.  Many of my favorite characters made appearances.  Some of the gags are getting a bit thin, but it wouldn't be Stephanie's life without a car explosion or two and some conflict in her family and love life.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the appearance of a slightly nastier villain than in recent books.  One of my favorite parts of the One for the Money was the edge of fear and threat.  I will admit that this villain was a little too kooky to be truly scary, but the end seemed to find the energy that I was looking for.<br />Also, I admit to being curious about number nine, since Ms. Evanovich has dropped some hints that Stephanie may be looking for something different.  Always a fan, I can't fault the very formula that I rely on.  It is an entertaining, if predictable read.
B00000K0E5|5.0|The first James Bond picture starring the suave Pierce Brosnan is one to never forget. Oops, 'Never Say Never Again'! James Bond loses his partner, 006 Alec Trevylan and he moves on with his mission. Satellite systems in Russia are controlled by Goldeneye, a specially made key that controls the safety of the world. Janus is a secret operative that has no face and is the head of this operation. James Bond runs into Natalya, an operator for the computer systems. Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen) is way too hot and is the best Bond girl ever. Look at that smile! Woo-ness! Especially the part in the casino at the beginning of the movie and the sauna room scene! It's the hottest ever! Famke Janssen is the best woman to have hit the big screen since I don't know! Drive that Ferrari! Oh yeah, back to the movie. Janus is unmasked and it will shock you. There are plenty of action scenes that deliver and Bond knows how to use a tank! Major kaboom-age and the climactic scene on the satellite is a shocker. Man, but I was distressed with the tree that crunched Xenia. It was a tear-jerker. Xenia, goddess and Natalya, no. But, truly, this is an excellent Bond film and has brought on a new generation to embrace the secret agent man!
0393317552|1.0|Helpfully, Diamond sums up his work:<br />\\"Authors are regularly asked by journalists to summarize a long book in one sentence. For this book, here is such a sentence: `History followed different courses for different peoples because of differences among peoples' environments, not because of biological differences among peoples themselves.\\"<br />His purpose is political:  to convince us that present-day disparities in social, economic, and intellectual achievement among population groups is not attributable to biological differences.  The glaring problem with the thesis:  biological differences follow from environmental differences.  <br />According to the \\"Out of Africa\\" theory, modern humans arose in Africa and migrated from there about 100,000 years ago.  If we accept Diamond's uncontroversial premise that Southwest Asia was a markedly different environment, that's an awfully long time for natural selection to work to fit the emigrants to a non-African environment. While the population that remained in Africa was evolving resistance to malarias, for instance, the emigrant population was adapting to its new environment(s) as it spread further across Asia and Europe.  (The gene for sickle cells -- distorted red blood cells -- in the heterozygous condition protects against some of the malarias; but it does so at the cost of causing a serious anemia when it is present in the homozygous  condition. Malaria is such a serious disease that a human population can afford the anemias in some individuals as long as other individuals are protected against malaria.)<br />Environmental differences were crucial to biological/genetic differentiation as each new environment created a feedback loop that selected for fitness for that environment.  Diamond's notion that after 100,000 years of such differentiation there are no significant genetic differences that affect success in present-day environments is inherently implausible and contrary to scientific observation of human biodiversity.
B00004Z4WQ|2.0|I thought I was going to watch a real scary movie, but I got this horrible spoof instead. Wait, it was horrifyingly bad, ha! From &quot;Scream&quot; to &quot;The Blair Witch Project,&quot; I was thorougly agitated with this smelly film. The Wayans brothers usually make me laugh, but not this time. Good thing Damon skipped this piece of vomit. The film tries to be clever by using the plot of &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Scream,&quot; but loses its originality with too many kielbasa sausage jokes. The most horrifying scene showed Ms. Mann and its secret. I don't remember laughing or even smiling during this movie. Directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans, who has done better working with Steven Seagal, also stars, Shannon Elizabeth and Shawn and Marlon Wayans. Too bad such talent came together for this wasted movie...
630382336X|5.0|This has to be the greatest music/rock film of all time.  The most significant quality that stands out in this film is the freshness and vitality that has been captured.  One is led to believe that this really is a &quot;day in the life&quot; of the Beatles---and so it was.  A truly great film overflowing with spontaneity and truly great songs that capture the feeling of the day.  The surrealistic aspects are quite intriquing and this is a film that I never get tired of watching.  Add a great supporting cast coupled with the Beatles' own unique brand of humor and you have a film that can be watched over and over always offering some little nuance waiting to be discovered.  Fantastic!

0446677450|5.0|...IS it the best written book? ...no! Does it give stock techniques or real estate secrets? Once again no. But for the average american i guarantee you this book WILL have you changing your ....thoughts about money! I agreed with the author so much about his thoughts on college education that i almost fell over reading it! I thought i was the only one who thought college was a big waste of time becasue YOU DONT LEARN MONEY IN COLLEGE! I repeat they dont teach you about money in college or in any other school for that matter! A reader said that a child should not worry about learning finances and investing. That is the same kind of thinking that has 1 in 3 americans in debt today! Please people teach your kids about investing and OWNING businesses NOT working in them! The author hates jobs as much as i do so thats why i connect with this guy so much! I  also hate school because it doesnt teach me what i really want to know and that is MONEY!  I dont know about you but im NOT going to school simply for the sake of learning more im going because i want to EARN MORE! But the problem is college only teaches you how to get a job! its a resume builder! Bill gates, Micheal dell: Dropouts! billionaires the both of them!  If you want to be rich and happy put down those silly college books and pick up some money books end of story!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I loved all three of these well acted, and well written movies. Part 1 is simply an astonishing movie for many reasons, like the music, the awesome story, and superb acting by all involved. Part 2 is my least favorite of the 3, but it is still good. Now part 3, is thee best of the series if you ask me, i did not see nothing wrong with sofia coppolas acting, and i am sooo sick and tired of reading about how people think Michael Corleones' \\"silent scream\\" at the end of the movie is dumb. To me that is thee most powerful part of the movie. I , a grown man, feel like crying everytime i watch the end. Do not be fooled by all the b/s critics saying bad stuff about part 3, it is excellent, and was nominated for best picture the year of its release. If you dont already own The godfather dvd collection, then you need to go and get it right now. This will make an awesome gift ,or a must needed addition to any dvd collection!!!
0385335482|4.0|I made the mistake of reading these books in the wrong order.  Luckily, it didn't make too much of a difference; I don't recommend it though.<BR>After reading her newest book; &quot;Shopaholic Takes Manhattan&quot;, my expectations we're set in place.  It's a quick, light read about the (mis)adventures of Becky Bloomwood.  There were a number of times though that I found myself getting really annoyed with Becky.  I even had to put it down a few times.  Overall, the book was quite good, except for the ending.  Even though I read them in the wrong order, her second book doesn't really continue where Becky left off.  It's a good read for a Sunday afternoon.
B00005RY7X|5.0|OK, we went through the guilt and sorrow that was grunge, sat through the pompus britpop wave, even got snotty with indie rock.  NOW, it's time to PARTY HARD.

B000066NW0|5.0|\\"Here's a novel marketing concept for this prefab pop moment: a teenage girl who sings and looks . . . like a real teenage girl!\\"~ Washington Post.  For the longest time I have been looking for a female artist like this.  'Let Go' is an artistic masterpiece that conveys the true feelings of teenagers today.  Avril writes about real life troubles in her own personal relationships.  In the song 'Losing Grip' she talks about a one sided relationship.  \\"Why should I care.  Cause you weren't there when I was scared.  I was so alone.\\"  This is something to relate to unlike pop princesses that sing songs like 'I'm a Slave for You'.  Last time I checked slavery was abolished when Abe Lincoln was president.  Another promising aspect of Avril's career is she WRITES HER OWN MUSIC.  Her lyrics come from the heart not some guy that sits alone in his room writing songs for other people to sing. This is an artist that little girls should look up to; a real girl that relates her music to real life.  Bottom Line; there is not one bad song on this CD it truly ROCKS!!!!!
B0000640RX|5.0|I'm going right for the meat and potatoes on this one.<br />Ok, you've got the Rambo movies all in one case, and I'm not saying they stuck three movies in one box, they have all the movies cased in a book format.<br />Then, for you pickers and choosers, they have all the Rambos in widescreen and full screen editions (I prefer widescreen though). But don't be fooled at the beginning of the full screen version, it just starts out in widescreen until the credits are finished and then it becomes full screen.<br />And, the box set contains a fourth disk that you CANNOT get anywhere but in this set. It contains more facts and featurettes about Rambo and what made it so great (and it has a play all feature for the people that don't want to go back and fourth through all of the featurettes). It also contains a neat little trvia game and sneak peeks at other DVDs.<br />In closing, people that love Rambo need this, and for the people that just love things blowing up...you need this as well. This is the essential Rambo collection, and it can also be called inexpensive action, because you have all of the Rambos and a special fourth DVD just for this set all packaged in a book format and a very sleek tin. Get this set you action freeks and Rambo-maniacs before Rambo hunts you down and makes you buy it!

B00005QDW1|5.0|Well, I guess I'm one of those losers sucked in by the media machine, but I love this album.  No Doubt has been living in my CD player for years and years, but this CD has just taken over.  I totally dig it - it makes for great driving music.  The lyrics are easy to learn, while serving as a great examination of the doubts that surround \\"true love.\\"  The grand production is probably what turned a lot of hard core fans off, but I love it.  I admit it!  Hey, Ric Ocasek just could not be involved in a bad record!  This record is an absolute gem and I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for a little fun.
B000066NW0|5.0|I have not heard such a moving. Avril inspires me to pick up a guitar and write my own music. Her lyrics are simple and creative. She talks mostly of relationships but also of herself. Her music is catchy and it's music you'll find yourself singing in the shower to. She has amazing talent and her music is original in every song. She can sing slowly like in &quot;Naked&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I'm With You&quot; and then hard and harsh in &quot;Unwanted&quot;. And then she can even it out by recording songs like her current single &quot;Complicated&quot;. I like how she deals with issues about how people see you. It always seems like people judge you by what you wear and she slams them down. I like that a lot. And relationships are always things people deal with. She has love songs and then she has heartbreak songs. Sometimes I have to remind myself that she wrote everything instead of the whole &quot;pop&quot; scene where people write their music for them. I recommend this CD to anyone. I think anyone who can appreciate music would like this. A DEFINITE BUY!!
B000002TYX|5.0|In 1995, the three living Beatles got together for a 10-hour Anthology video set and TV series.  The videos were released along with three 2-CD sets of previously unreleased demos, live recordings, and rehearsal takes.  This is the first of the three, which covers 1958-1964.  The set opens with a rather bad but historic jam with Paul, Ringo and George singing &quot;Free as a Bird.&quot; Then we hear the Beatles' first record (&quot;That'll Be The Day&quot;) and it's B-side (&quot;In Spite Of All The Danger&quot;).  Both of these are pretty good, and give a rare glimpse of the start of their music.  The three of them (at that time) made some home recordings in 1960, and three songs from that tape are presented here.  These represent the good, hard-backed, raw sound that the Beatles were known for in the early days.  Their first record, &quot;My Bonnie,&quot; is next followed by other Sheridan-Beatles songs, all of which are glorious rockers.  The Decca audition tape is nice to hear; you can sure tell the difference, though, when Ringo is brought in.  We then rock our way through the ondon Polladium and Sweedan with several great live performances.  The Beatles joke their way through the Royal Variety Show, especially John's introduction to &quot;Twist &amp; Shout:&quot; &quot;Would the people in the cheaper seats clap your hands.  And the rest of you just ratle your jewelery.&quot;  We hear great outtakes of several songs from &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;Beatles For Sale,&quot; most notably the 3-part harmony at the beginning of &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; and the more country-style version of &quot;Can't Buy Me Love.&quot;  The great live performances and the early demos and rare studio outtakes combine to make the perfect audio documentary of the Beatles' early years.
B00005B36H|5.0|it doesn't matter how many times I play this CD, I can't seem to leave it alone for more than a week. I enjoy all types of music so the supposed change that took place in TOOL has not affected me in the least. It seems softer than previous works but fairly unnoticable when really taking the music in. It's definitely a CD that takes a complete listening to, otherwise songs and idea's are taken out of context and it gets ruined. If you really like music that is layered (like Pink Floyd) this will not let you down.
B000002LK1|5.0|I'll keep it short.   This album followed one of the greatest DM offerings and mangaged to top in listenability if not content.

044022425X|2.0|Ostensibly, \\"Drums of Autumn\\" is about reunions with fathers.  Gabaldon, however, seems to meander about quite a bit before she remembers her theme.  Although I didn't do an exact count, I agree with the reviewer who commented that the first 500 pages are terrible.  \\"Drums\\" begins with Jamie and Claire attending the execution of one of Jamie's fellow inmates.  Jamie and Claire, plus entourage, are heading to a Scottish settlement in Wilmington, North Carolina, where his aunt owns a plantation.  The first half of the book mostly involves the mishaps on their journey north, life at the aunt's plantation, Jamie's debate over whether to strike out on his own or accept his aunt's generous offer, an adventure-filled trip to the wilderness, and ultimately, getting settled in a home in the new world.<br />While I don't want to suggest that all these events are mundane--this is Jamie and Claire Fraser we're talking about, after all--the events are very episodic.  Gabaldon lacks any kind of overriding theme to organize the plot.  In \\"Outlander,\\" we had Claire's ultimate decision about whether to return to her 20th century life.  In \\"Dragonfly in Amber,\\" we had their attempt to prevent Culloden.  In \\"Voyager,\\" we first had Claire's search for records of what happened to Jamie, and later the search and rescue of Jamie's nephew Ian.<br />Also missing in \\"Drums\\" is a good villain.  With the deaths of Jack Randall and Geillis Duncan, Gabaldon has to create a new bad guy or two.  She does introduce her villains fairly early on--only their true malevolence does not become apparent until much later.  In other words, unlike the way the threat of Jack Randall loomed in \\"Outlander,\\" the threat of these villains seems to disappear when they initially disappear from the plot.<br />About halfway through \\"Drums,\\" the Frasers' daughter, Brianna, who remains in the 20th century, discovers something about her parents' fate and decides to travel to the past to warn them.  Her boyfriend, Roger Wakefield, follows her.  Once Brianna and Roger wind up in the past, the plot tends to liven up, and the direction of the book also begins to make sense.  Without revealing certain plot twists, I will note that certain events should create a sense of urgency to get certain issues resolved--and yet Gabaldon does not really leave the reader that worried about the potential outcomes.  Gabaldon does manage a few nice little plot twists at the end, so keep going.  Suffice to say that Roger has an interesting encounter with an ancestor, and Frank's influence comes into play.<br />Despite my tepid praise for this book, as historical romances go, it's still quite good--just not as good as the first three.  One aspect that I appreciate about Gabaldon's books is that she does not overly romanticize the hardships and harsh living conditions of the past.  She also deftly avoids overly sentimentalizing certain situations or going for the cliche.  For instance, when Brianna meets her real father, at long last, after traveling through time and across the ocean, she first seems him behind a pub, urinating--not in some idealized encounter.<br />I'm crossing my fingers that \\"The Fiery Cross\\" is better, but I'm not optimistic.
B000002KDO|5.0|i hate to admit how many times i have listened to this cd with headphones late at night. you can't go wrong with any of the first six sabbath cd's, ending with sabotage. however, this one is my favorite. yes, their next three cd's: vol.4, sabbath bloody sabbath, and sabotage show a more complex, mature and artistic statement being made. but the raw power from these simple stripped down songs can not be ignored. the cd starts with \\"sweet leaf\\", which portrays reefer madness. the stuttering cough to open the cd is an all-time classic. on \\"after forever\\" check out the ending to iommi's solo where the guitar phases out from left to right speaker, then switching back and forth. great early recording technique. this song also includes these shocking ozzie lyrics: \\"would you like to see the pope on the end of a rope, do you think he's a fool?\\" i love how \\"orchid\\" leads into \\"lord of this world\\". it's like sabbath is lulling you to sleep with iommi's beautiful instrumental on \\"orchid\\", and then WHAM!...\\"lord of this world\\" kicks in with authority. i also enjoy the heavy funk riff that begins \\"into the void\\". often people talk about the \\"wall of sound\\" that this band produces. it is the most evident on this album. if you are deciding on a first cd by this band, i would suggest this one. because of it's simple structure, it will take only a few listens before you thoroughly enjoy it. just don't forget to try with headphones. you won't regret it!
B00004T8RK|5.0|This is the most underrated PJ cd, and in my opinion blows away Yield and could hang with Ten as their all time best. While it lacks the guitar driven energy that made Ten so popular, it doesn't have the anger and poppier melodies that made Vs., it doesn't have the experimentation that Vitalogy and No Code had, and it doesn't carry the lyrical message that made Yield. It is Pearl Jam entering a new era - their experimentation from Vitalogy and No Code seems to have found its stride, and from here it can only get better. While I do miss their grunge days, they did anything but sell out and their musical ability continues to grow. They still have a bit of hard rock in them (Breakerfall,God's Dice,and Evacuation) but on this one its actually the slower and softer songs that are so great. Songs like Thin Air and Of the Girl are absolutely amazing. Also do not overlook Light Years and Nothing as it Seems, which may not get the radio play of the old Pearl Jam, but are in no means any worse. I hope PJ continues to put out records like this for many years to come.
B000002IZ4|5.0|When STP's debut cd, Core, made it to the big time, music critics dogged them on how much they sounded like Pearl Jam. Well, after listening to Purple, I think the critics will shut up. This is a great album, a much different twist and more dimensions than Core. If you like 90's hard rock, this is an album you definitely need to pick up. The outstanding songs are Unglued, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, and Vasoline.
B000008LOU|4.0|The infamous Wilburys are back again, but the second outing is lacking something that made the first one great, Roy Orbison. I think his absence hurt the Wilburys, in their writing, playing, and overall performing. While the album is great, and is definitely worth the buy, it just does not compare to the first one.
B00005NWM3|3.0|THe first time I heard How You Remind Me, i thought it rocked, so I went and got the cd, and that was a waste of money. Every song on here sounds exactly the same, power chorded rock in dropped d way overdone, and Chad Kroeger trying to sing, by the time you get to Too Bad, you can't even listen anymore. It does have some decent points though, Never Again is a decent rocker with good lyrics, How You Remind Me (if you can stand to listen to it anymore), and Where Do I Hide, which is the best song on the album.
B000021XR5|3.0|I think STP is one of the greatest hard rock bands of their era - this one made me wonder about that and kind of put me in disbelief about that. Its good to see them back together, but maybe I was expecting a little too much from them. <BR>Down - Cool intro, but whole song sounds like they are trying too hard to get back in the mainstream, it just comes off annoying, but it does have a good solo. 3/5<br />Heaven and Hot Rods - Best hard rock song on this album, maybe there is some potential for new STP 5/5<br />Pruno - Not an outstanding song, but its ok 4/5<br />Church on Tuesday - Don't like the way it starts out, but sounds good at the end when all the vocal parts start blending together 3/5<br />Sour Girl - This song was great when I first bought the album, but the radio really destroyed a great tune 4/5<br />No Way Out - A decent hard rocker, not up to par with the old STP though 3/5<br />Sex and Violence - Cool punkish type song, good lyrics, I wish they would play this one on the radio 5/5<br />Glide - now on to the 9th track 2/5<br />I Got You - 2nd best song on the album, great tune 5/5<br />MC5 - Great rock song, great 5/5<br />Atlanta - best song on cd, great Doors-y type sound 5/5
B000020617|5.0|I heard alot of people saying that after Pat left, the Foo Fighters were going to be bad. Not only did they come back with a new guitarist and a good album, they had made the best album of their career. It leans more to the pop side of the house than the other two, but if you can pull it off, then why not do it. This one will definitely get my vote for rock album of the year.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album to me is the best alternative rock cd ever. Every song on here is amazing, there is not one weak song in the album, this album is an essential, I recommend this cd to everyone, no matter what the price, it is worth it.
B000008LOV|5.0|When a lineup like Roy Orbison, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, and Jeff Lynne get together, one would expect something amazing, and on Vol. 1, it is so much more than that. To me, this album is better than any of these guys solo work by far. This one is constantly in my cd player, and to me is the best rock and roll album of all time. My personal favorite song is End of the Line, but the other songs on here are not even close to being worse. If you find this anywhere, pick it up because its been out of print and is getting harder to find.
0064407667|4.0|The poor Baudelaire kids. First, they are orphaned, then sent to live with the awful Count Olaf and his evil group of henchmen (and henchwomen, and one who seems, well, genderless). Soon they find he's after one thing: the fortune left to them by their poor departed parents, and he'll do anything to get it. But the kids are not without resources of their own. Violet is a clever inventor, Klaus has extensive book knowledge, and baby Sunny can chew through just about anything. Will they escape the horrible fate planned for them? Of course, but as the series title suggests, there's always another unfortunate event awaiting them...<br />Kids and adults will likely enjoy this oddball, off-the-wall mix of grim humor, bad puns, plays on words, and literary playfulness, a blend of Dahl, Dickens, and Charles Addams. There are unpleasant aspects to the story, and death seems to loom on every other page, but the resourceful and clever Baudelaire children always escape just in time--and kids will like the fact that they usually do so relying on their own talents. Although this has been touted as a companion to Harry Potter, there are remarkable differences between the two, most notably in style and humor. Kids who like the \\"darker\\" aspects of the Potter books may relate to this, but those who have read the aforementioned Dahl will find it easier to enjoy.
0553269631|5.0|I read this book many years ago and found it to be way better than the movie.  It centers around a deaf man named Mr. Singer.  It is a fascinating human interest story which helps us understand that even though a person is deaf, they are still a person with the same hopes and aspirations as anyone else.
0345350499|4.0|I got this book after I finished reading the Lord of the Rings Trilogy - which I also recommend - because I was absolutely enthralled in all the mystery of ancient myths and fables.  This book is great.  Absolutely enchanting, once you start reading you feel for the characters! One of the best books I've read yet!
B00005RHGK|3.0|Jeepers Creepers starts off with an EXTREMELY suspenseful, thrilling first act that will seriously have you at the edge of your seat with a big grin on your face. However, after the first 40 minutes or so, the movie quickly runs out of steam and just gets stuck into the mud. It's quite a shame too, with such a great set-up you expect this to be THE horror movie event of your life. The story involves a brother and sister heading home together from college on Spring break, who, like all horror movie characters, make all the bad moves (Going down deserted highways, going back to bad situations with lame excuses). On a quiet country road, they are nearly run off the road by a enormous truck. They think nothing of the matter, until later down the road they drive by the house of that same truck driver and see him dumping \\"something\\" wrapped in blood soaked sheets down a hole in his yard. Of course, this is a horror movie, and the characters soon make a very stupid move in the next five minutes, but I won't ruin anymore of it for you (since it's the only section of the movie you will enjoy). Needless to say, what results is very tense and exciting. As I was watching it I just kept thinking in my head, over and over, \\"This is the best movie I have ever seen\\" but once you see how the movie moves into it's second and third acts, you will see why this movie just bottoms out on so many levels. First of all, the \\"killer\\" was so much freakier and scarier when I didn't know his motive or even what he is (That just REALLY ruined the movie). Add to that some stupid psychic lady thrown into the mix for no reason, and this movie just doesn't deliver. Like I said before, it's quite sad. The people who made this movie should have known better than to ruin such potential.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I would like to start of buy saying that you don't have to like anime to like this movie. This movie as you might have heard it the top grossing movie in Japan, and for a good reason. <BR>  Mononoke is the best movie you will ever see. period. There arn't any bad guys but there arn't any good guys eather. I think that you should order this movie now. It's perfect!
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan's debut CD No pads, no helmets, just balls is packed with great lyrics that any teenager can appreciate. Simple plan are talented, honest musicians and anyone who picks up their new CD is guaranteed to love the music and to have a good laugh, courtesy of the bands witty sense of humor and obvious distaste for all things adolescent. Great Cd, everyone should pick it up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXXS|3.0|The film is only so-so, but the extras on the DVD are fun.  It's interesting to see the progression of special effects through the three movies from either digital OR model to a striking combination of both.<br />Probably the best DVD extras of any of the three films.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I thought this movie was very creative and also very well done for such a &quot;different&quot; premise. Christopher Nolan and his brother ( the writer ) did an great job and i think great things are to come of them.As for the movie....A tour de force of creative imagery and it keeps you interested throughout the whole movie no matter if it goes im complete reverse.I highly reccomend it to anyone with a working brain.
0790749815|5.0|When you look at North By Northwest closely, you see many parts from Alfred Hitchcock's other films. The premise, a man accused of a crime he didn't commit, was used in The 39 Steps, Strangers on a Train, To Catch a Thief and The Wrong Man, to name a few. Eva Marie Saint, not known as a glamour girl, was remade by Hitchcock to mimic Grace Kelly's cool, blonde beauty. Cary Grant's escape in the auction scene recalls Robert Donat's similar scene in The 39 Steps. The climax on Mount Rushmore recalls the fight on The Statue of Liberty in Saboteur. Even Cary Grant is, in a way, a \\"retread,\\" having appeared in Suspicion, Notorious and To Catch a Thief. As one film critic put it, North By Northwest is a summation of Hitchcock's work.<br />However, to simply dismiss North By Northwest as a retread would be like calling Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band just another Beatles album. EVERYTHING works perfectly in this movie with memorable scene after memorable scene (Grant's drunk driving escape, the murder at the U.N., the cropduster attack, Mount Rushmore, etc., etc., etc.). Robert Burks' terrific photography greatly enhances the actors and the locations. George Tomasini's editing maintains a crisp pace. Bernard Herrmann's score is a standout, even when compared to his large body of great work (that's really saying something considering his great scores for Citizen Kane, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Vertigo, Psycho and Taxi Driver, among others). And Ernest Lehman's script is one of the wittiest and most entertaining screenplays in film history. Add to that the great locations like New York City, Chicago and Mount Rushmore and you've got the elements of a classic.<br />However, the film's greatest strength lies in its casting and performances, especially by Grant. Grant, Saint, James Mason, Leo G. Carroll, Martin Landau and Jessie Royce Landis form a terrific ensemble. Grant's performance, in particular, is wonderful. Present in almost every scene, Grant is the glue that holds the film together. With a weaker actor in the role, the film would have fallen apart. Like Hitchcock himself, Cary Grant wasn't truly appreciated during his career and was more than the one-dimensional charmer many people took him for. Grant perfectly conveys the situation of a confident Madison Avenue ad man who quickly loses control over his life. He has to express confidence, bewilderment, sadness, panic, lust, betrayal and triumph and does so magnificently. It's a shining moment in Grant's great career.<br />The DVD is terrific, the best feature of which is a great documentary hosted by Eva Marie Saint. (Among other facts revealed, the original title of the film was \\"The Man in Lincoln's Nose). It's a fitting presentation for a great film. Along with Vertigo and Psycho, North By Northwest marks the absolute best of Alfred Hitchcock's work. It doesn't get any better than this just about perfect film.
0345350499|5.0|This was the first book dealing with the Arthurian legends that I ever read. I suspect it won't be the last, but in my mind it is certainly one of the best, if not the best.<br /><br />It made a change to have the legends told from the perspective of the women involved in Arthur's life, rather than just the men and their fight in battles.<br /><br />Morgaine becomes a sympathetic character rather than the evil witch she is more normally portrayed as. The characters and situations seem so real that when you look away from the book, you are surprised to see modern day things around you.<br /><br />The portrayal of the new Christian religion against the old religion of the goddess was deftly handled and the comparison between the two was interesting.<br /><br />It's a hard book to put down once started and it's one to read over and over again. I've lost count how many times I've read it now and there is still something new to discover in each reading.<br /><br />Reviewed by Annette Gisby, author of Shadows of the Rose
B00005YW4H|5.0|I absolutely love this cd.  Her voice is so soft and beautiful.  I can't wait to see her in Los Angeles when she's here!   It's such a soulful mix of jazz, folk, and a hint of country.  I highly recommend it.
0446677450|1.0|I have read about first 90 pages of this book and frankly speaking, it seems to be offending any educated person's intelligence. I can't understand why the book is so popular...<BR>The book's main premise seems to be that one should invest only in income generating activities (author calls these \\"assets\\") and avoid any expense related activities (\\"liabilities\\"). Lot of what was said in the first 90 pages was commonsense and so repetitive that I started skipping sentences, paragraphs and then even pages without missing out much. I shouldn't have bought this one...<BR>I would not add this book to my \\"asset\\" column. For those who have already bought this book, I recommend that they follow the author's advice about \\"assets\\" and \\"liabilities\\" - and sell this book :-) I did.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie is probably the most interesting pop singer. since she came back to our attention, it is without a doubt kylie is wiser, more experienced and carries a light sense of irony towards her &quot;position&quot; as a pop-dive. all these are being pronounced within &quot;Fever&quot;,making it a pure entertainment.
B00005U122|5.0|One of the best Music DVD's in my collection.  Great Mix of classic Floyd tunes and selections from Roger's solo career.  Sound Quality is A+++.  Graham and Snowy on guitar will almost prompt you to say David who?  Backup Singers are right on the mark also.  Highly Recommend this DVD....Roger Waters IS PINK FLOYD!
B00005B4GU|3.0|My problem with Radiohead is this. They are obviously brilliant. And I feel bad for not really really adoring this album. It's worthy of adoration. But- it's cold. It's distant, far away stuff- you can't like the people involved, you aren't convinced to. I need heart in my music. <BR>That being said, Pyramid song has the beauty of an icicle, and is enough to keep the cd in my stereo for long long periods of time.
B00005KHJR|5.0|I remember watching Wicker man a few years back, and being completely blown away by its power. It has earned itself a 'cult' status,although it is an unfair description, usually given to films that are very good, unseen at its time of release, but rediscovered and reassessed years later.<BR>And Wicker man is very very good. It is the type of film that slowly builds up to an ending that makes all the 'twists' directors nowadays like to include, pretty predictable.<BR>Its mood is slow, but very misleading, at it pulls you unawares into this evil world, disguised as this idealic and peaceful Scottish village. It gives a new meaning to Nothing is what it Seems..and the darkness of people is perfectly contrasted with their seemingly normal lives, a bit similar to Lynch's Twin Peeks, but much more poignat and effective. <BR>It is a horror film like no other, one that is directed at your mind and psyche, as opposed to the regular gore fest most horror films rely on.<BR>The film was mercilessly cut for its VHS release and its TV showing, which makes me wonder about the psychological state of the censors!!, but gladly the film has been restored for its DVD release with excellent extras.<BR>It is a film that can be seen again and again, and everytime you will react the same way to it, and watch in disblief  at an ending that will DISTURB YOU!!<BR>Wicker man is a must buy for all cinema lovers!!
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I love this CD. I fell in love with it after I first heard &quot;Don't Turn Off the Lights&quot; on TRL. I had loved Escape and Hero also. At first, when I listened to his other songs I was alittle put off they were really poppy. And I am not a really big pop fan. But that voice. After listening to it a couple times I started to fall in love with the CD. Enrique co-wrote all the songs on the CD. Did a good job. My favorite songs are She Be the One, Love 4 fun, and Escapar. I recommend this CD even if you usually don't like POP. I would get it.
B000062TU1|5.0|This Movie is a wonderful movie for kids and adults alike. There are great special effects and spectacular acting. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson are delightful as Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Among the adult actors, my favorite ones are Richard Harris as Dumbledore, Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Alan Rickman as Snape, and John Hurt as Mr. Ollivander. Chris Columbus did an excellent job directing this movie and John Williams composed an excellent score. On the DVD, there are many different things to do like there is a self-guided tour of Hogwarts and there are interviews with the crew. My favorite scenes in this movie are Quidditch and the gigantic wizard chess match. VERY COOL! As this is a wonderful movie, I would not recommend this movie for very small children, as there are some scary parts in this movie. All in all, this is a great movie to purchase.
B000066NW0|5.0|I have never bought a Cd that was made by a girl and liked every song. Until I bought Avril's CD. I highly recommend this CD. If you like Complicated and excepted the same poppy beat for every song your not gonna get what you expected. This CD is a great CD and if you own it you understand. If you like POP music then don't get it because you won't really like it. But who knows I could be wrong. All I know is that this CD is great. BUY IT!
0688170528|3.0|A very quick, easy read. The characters are fairly one-dimensional and some of the descriptions and overly obvious &quot;fore-shadowing&quot; made me want to gag. However, I kept with it out of a desire to know what &quot;really&quot; happened. It would make a great, slightly cheesy, TV movie.
B000060P79|5.0|if you like NEW FOUND GLORY ull love Simple Plan they are the best new punk band out there, so buy it or be square
B00004SGNJ|1.0|This recording contains the dying groans of Billy Holiday.  It appeals only to the voyeurs of human tragedy and misery.  Holiday's singing is barely in tune much of the time and she sounds about 100 yrs old.  It reminds me of Elvis In Concert, in which Elvis likewise, was obviously near the end of his life.
B000066JES|1.0|Let me preface my review by saying I am a huge Manowar fan. I put up with a lot ... from my friends because they don't like the group. I've gone to concerts by myself because no one would go with me. However, this is possibly the worst CD I've ever bought. I wouldn't sell this on ebay because I would feel bad I passed this ... onto someone. Maybe this was an experiment. If it was, it was a bad one. I want the Manowar that wrote Revelations, Kill With Power and Battle Hymns.
B000002UAX|2.0|Although there are bright spots, especially the opening track, the album never truly rebounds as strongly thereafter.  Out of 30 songs, about 12 are really good, and should have been singled out to comprise one awesome album (USSR, Birthday, Yer Blues, Revolution...)  12 out of 30 = 40%, and that's 2 stars.
B00004T37H|5.0|this is a great movie with a good amount of action and a great story id have to say that this is a must have anime for any anime collection.
B000002UAR|2.0|This album is really below average, especially for the Beatles. Eleanor Rigby, Here There &amp; Everywhere, Yellow Submarine, I Want To Tell You and Tomorrow Never Knows are awful.  On the other hand, Taxman, She Said, Dr. Robert and And Your Bird Can sing are good. In summary, four songs can't save the album. <br />This is a 2 star album - at best.
0312265859|4.0|Janet Evanovich takes you on a ride that you don't wan't to get off.  I finished this book in a matter of hours (the kids opened their own cans for dinner) and the ending was surprising.  Probably not my favorite Stephanie Plum book, but when I finished it I started reading it again. That tells me that Evanovich is doing something right.  When does the movie come out?
0066620996|4.0|Jim Collins asked the question, could a company make the leap from good to great?  If yes, is there something that these companies have in common?  Do the companies that continue to linger in mediocrity have anything in common?  <BR>After 5 years of research Good to Great reveals some surprising results and principles that companies and individuals can apply to change their lives and corporations future.  From a list of 1,435 companies 11 made the cut as making the transition from good to great.  The research set criteria that a corporation had to have 15 years of sustained average/good results followed by a transition and 15 years of stock growth at least 3 times the average market performance.<BR> The eleven companies are not known as Wall Street superstars but they all have something in common.  Perhaps there quiet leadership and focus is why they are not the number 1 held stock in individual stock portfolios.  Jim Collins points out several easy to grasp principles and correlations among the 11 good to great companies.  Corporations that made the leap to greatness all followed the coined phrase of getting the right people on the bus first.  He meant that before the company begins its journey it should have the correct employees on the bus.  This could mean removing several existing employees bringing on new staff and then rearranging them into the correct seats.  With this theory in practice corporate leadership can lead the bus in any direction.  Good to Great introduces Level 5 leadership.  All 11 companies had a Level 5 CEO.  They possess certain characteristics such as being shy, humble but intensely focused on their job and putting the company above their own personal attention.  The themes that are stressed during the book are easy to understand and retain.  The implications of the research state that even though the principles seem simple there is no quick fix to getting the right people on the bus or achieving Level 5 leadership qualities.  The Hedgehogprinciple of focusing on your core business and knowing that very well sounds simple but companies fail every year because they move outside their core competencies and lose their focus.  We would recommend this book to executives, CEOs, and students.  The book gives a focused view of success based on proven results.
0312265859|5.0|Hard Eight is such a great book. I am a die hard Stephaine Plum and Janet Evanovich fan. Stephanie is back in action with a new \\"sidekick\\" in Albert K-l-o-u-g-h-n (pronounced \\"clown\\") and she is ready for action. Or so she thinks! This time it's war. In this book, I followed Stephanie through at least four pairs and handcuffs, a flock of wild, atacking geese, and tons more action. I laughed my way through the book and was delighted at the changes in the relationships of Stephanie and Ranger and Stephanie and Joe. By the end of the book, I was dying for another round. Guess I'll have to wait until next year!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is such great fun to watch!  Don't take it seriously and have fun and it will become one of your favorite 10 movies of all time.  The reviewer that is concerned about the cows getting shot; well PLEASE read the credits, \\"No animals were harmed...\\"  Same goes for the shot that looks like a cow gets hit by Baby Face Nelson's car.  These were computer generated effects, people!!  And the poor reviewer that made the \\"Green Acres\\" comment, well, sir, you simply don't get it!  Great fun to watch and fascinating to listen to, great \\"Old Timey\\" music and the soundtrack is STILL in the top ten on the country music charts.  Don't miss this movie!
B00005MNP7|5.0|I owned this album shortly after it came out in the 80's.  I purchased it again recently and although many years passed in the interim, enjoyed it as much or more than I did when I orginally purchased the album many years ago.<br />  This is one of those CD's that although dated, still seem fresh and relevant.  Lyrically, I feel it is one of Blondie's best works.  The band matured by the point of this release and their musical content reflects that.  <br />   Surprisingly, there are 4 &quot;Bonus Tracks&quot; included. Live versions of material played in various European concerts. This includes the odd choice of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; from the soundtrack of the film &quot;Roadie&quot;.  <br />   I would not hesitate to recommend this album to anyone.
B000005J56|4.0|I didn't take to the sound of this record at first lesson, but it did grow and grow on me.  This is Afro-Cuban music.  Some say it's not the best representation of the genre, but it sounds good to my ears.  I especially enjoyed the opening number, &quot;Chan Chan&quot; and the Ibrahim Ferrer rendition of &quot;De Camino a La Vereda&quot;. Also, Omar Portuondo's &quot;Veinte Anos.&quot;<br />However, I especially enjoyed &quot;Pueblo Nuevo&quot; and the title cut, &quot;Buena Vista Social Club&quot; (each with a captivating jazz sound) and the concluding rendition of &quot;La Baymesa&quot;.
B00003CXZ1|3.0|There's just 'something about' this Utterly Spectacular Lady that brings you back for more and more!  ANGELINA JOLIE has more sex appeal in her little finger than most established wannabees!  AND she can act - so!  Enuf said!  This is a delightful little romp - kind of a throw-back to the sixties stuff - 'Modesty Blaise', 'Deadlier Than the Male', 'Fathom', etc.<br />*** Great 'reversal' scene too when - instead of the usual 'Gal in the Shower Routine', it's the Guy - with Ms. Jolie as the Intruder, and very, very tasteful too!  Classy - that's it! The Rest?  Good to Superior special effects - especially the opening sequence with the 'haywire' robot - shades of 'Saturn 3'.<br />No, as said, it's not a spectacular movie, but it does deliver and the DVD quality is excellent!<br />Good directorial pacing by Mr. West - promising work!<br />Sequel please Ms. Jolie!
B0000399WI|5.0|The shawshank Redemption changed my life. It made me see that no  matter how bad life can be there is still beauty in the world and to never give up on your hopes and dreams.
B00005QXDD|5.0|This is the greatest and best CD in the world.
0375501851|5.0|Despite the mixed reviews from amazon.com readers, I have to say that reading \\"White Teeth\\" got me interested in the society of Great Britain that is rarely shown in the media.  She does a great job on tackling race, sex, class, and history.  Her geographical research from Jamaica to Turkey to Bangladesh is an excellent guide for the reader as she is describing her characters and their reason for being in the story.  <BR>The book based in North London encounters two unlikely, yet interesting men Archie Jones and Samad Iqbal.  The reason I say interesting because as you read in to the story you wonder why they are the way they are.  Both men \\"served\\" in World War 2.  The word served is quoted because they really didn't do any combat in their battalion.  They rather served their commander and battalion.  Even after the war, they still serve; but to their employers.  Archie works for a printing company performing miniscule tasks and Samad is a waiter in an Indian restaurant.<BR>The book touches on some issue of multiculturalism and assimilation.  Samad, fearing that his sons will be too influenced by the mainstream culture of rap and rock music and name brand clothes, sends one son to live with his family in Bangladesh leaving one son behind.  He couldn't afford to send the both to live with his family.  He wants his sons to know the meaning of Islam and what it is to be a colored.  But he himself doesn't really have any idea of who he really is.  He drinks Guiness and is in the past about a sepoy who resisted the British.  He is even more disappointed when his sons have failed to live up to his expectations.<BR>Irie Jones, the daughter of Clara Bowden, a Jamaican, and Archie Jones, is dealing with her own awkwardness.  She is attracted to the wreckless Millat who only sees her as a friend.  She works for the Chalfens who are influential to her which upsets her mother.  She looks at her family and at Samad's family and comes to the conclusion that they are all outrageous.<BR>The book for me was too hard to put down.  I had to know what would happen next in chapters as I was reading.  I find that reading takes a great deal of patience and reading \\"White Teeth\\" one has to understand what the writer is talking about.
B00003CXXP|3.0|Though the acting, score, effects, lighting &amp; photography and the basic underlying story are fantastic, the story drags, and (as so many others have commented in much more detail) the mishmash of Kubrickian and Spielbergian sensibilities doesn't play well.  The Azimov-based Bicentennial Man (which came out earlier and is less visually amazing - and was probably launched to compete with and pre-empt A.I., which took much longer to make), shares A.I.'s sappiness in parts, and is not as convincing in its effects or the acting of the central, robot character, yet somehow manages to tell almost the same story, in its most meaningful parts, much more effectively.  A.I. suffers from far too much &quot;wonder&quot; (heartstring-pulling fairy tale hooey plays really well in a movie like Edward Scissorhands, but just plain fails, dismally, in a non-comedy sci fi film that is intending to make a serious point.)  In the end, neither A.I. nor Bicentennial Man make any point we didn't already understand intuitively, yet somehow they both make you understand the nature of &quot;humanity&quot; and &quot;personhood&quot; a little better all the same, and both are worth at least one viewing.  I cannot give A.I. a one- or two-star rating, for all its flaws, for that reason and because the effects, design and art direction are so very, very well done (in some cases breaking entirely new ground).<br />PS: The odd thing about Bicentennial Man is that, although it is a &quot;dramedy&quot;, with a lot of comedic elements (some of them clearly intended for the child audience, with the overall theme of the film being much more mature), the humans, especially the central family, in A.I. are much less real-seeming and believable than those in B.M.  A.I.'s organic people seem cut-out and one-dimensional; despite the length of the film and its themes of defining humanity and discovery of self, only the two non-organic main characters (played impeccably by Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law) show any real character development (mostly in the former).<br />PPS: The A.I. DVD edition does have many nice extras (that you'll actually watch - no full script texts or silent &quot;interactive&quot; sequences of boring stills you have to flip through, but lots of behind-the-scenes featurettes on various aspects of the film.)any real character development (mostly in the former).<br />PPS: The A.I.

0380789019|4.0|So I was late in finding Neil Gaiman. But I picked up *American Gods,* fell in love with it, and quickly sought out all else by Gaiman. This search, of course, brought me to *Neverwhere*.<br />Now, where my reaction to *American Gods* was immediate and fierce, *Neverwhere* simmered. The last page turned, I was pleased and disappointed. The story was entertaining and humorous--with villians like Croup and Vandemar, how could it be anything else? But it didn't make me turn the pages with the same anticipation. For a week or so after I tried to figure out why this was.<br />It's some kind of cosmic law that whenever you a read a truly satisfying book, whatever you read immediately after is doomed to disappoint. And I should chalk up a good deal of my reaction to this law. However, there were some points that substantiate it. Such as the fact that this novel seemed a tad bit rushed. Characters, places, plots--they all had substance, but at times they didn't seem fleshed out. I cared about Richard and Door and the rest, but moreso in retrospect than while I was reading. And the ending. Well, it didn't seem like the right place to have an ending. Recent questions put forth to Neil Gaiman in regards to a sequel have brought positive responses. Which rather nullifies my complaint about that issue. <br />And I also realized that the content of the two novels completely separate them. *Neverwhere* seems to be pure entertainment. You're meant to enjoy the fantastical people and places, it's suppose to allow you the same kind of escape that Richard Mayhew finds in London Below. And, after it simmered, I realized that it fulfilled all of its purposes.
B00005R23Z|3.0|As with too many other SuperBit editions, this one<br />simply dumped the special features (documentary<br />featurette in this case) present on the original edition.<br />I'm not sure when this studio's going to clue in that<br />the main reason people buy DVD over VHS is<br />extra features.  Maybe they are starting to understand<br />this, as both The Patriot and Hollow Man [why? it was a total waste of film...] have been issued as &quot;SuperBit Deluxe&quot; editions with an extra disc containing the special features that were on the original &quot;NormalBit&quot; release.  So why not this treatment with Gattaca?  I'll stick to my original version, thanks.  Barely perceptable increase in video quality simply isn't enough of a draw to dump the documentary extras.

044022425X|4.0|Although I loved this fourth book, I also was a tiny, and I mean tiny, lol, bit disapointed that we didn't get to see much of Claire and Jamie's life in the New World as this one focused mainly on their daughter Brianna.<br />In the last book 'Voyager', Claire and Jamie are cast ashore in the Carolinas with nowhere to go and with no hope of returning to a unstable Scotland. 'Drums of Autumn' picks up right where it left off and we see them safely to the Colony of Cape Fear, North Carolina, where other exiled Jackobite Scot Highlanders settled.<br />Here they make a new life where the rivers run clear and the rolling hills remind them of home and the fertile valleys give them hope. Jamie becomes disheartened when the British Crown threatens everyone's peace and the Americans begin to rile over taxes and control of their new home.<br />Striving to get away from government control, Jamie takes Claire farther into the wilderness and into the mountains; at last finding a precarious foothold. He is convinced that war cannot invade into their mountain sanctuary.<br />History spares no one and Brianna, the daughter Claire and Jamie have left in the future finds a terrifying piece of information from the past that throws a black shadow over her peace of mind.<br />Her mother and a father are in danger.<br />Not wanting to sit back while history completes itself, Brianna follows her mother into the past to change history and finds herself flung into a foreign world that was once her own. But now Brianna finds her own life in danger and must make a decision so heartbreaking that it will tear their fragile family apart.<br />Love, pain, treachery and tragedy bring this story to life. I liked Brianna alot, but was a little bit disapointed that the entire book seemed focused on her travels(which by the way I thought was fascinating)and her life.<br />We get to see Claire again and brave Jamie, but only briefly here and there.<br />Jamie has changed a little in this book, gotten older and matured. He is very sweet, but now is wary of people and overly protective. Jamie is the 'perfect man', if a man can get that perfect, lol.<br />Claire also has matured and shown us how she has changed in little ways.

0312265859|4.0|I received this book yesterday, and spent my entire evening reading it.  In Stephanie Plum tradition, it is a great page turner, very hard to put down.  It was true to form with the other seven (the cases, the cars, etc) but seemed to lack something.  And I'm not sure what.  Of course, all of us die-hard fans will be buying and reading it anyway, and I'm certainly glad that I did add it to my library, but I feel jipped somehow.  Now I have to wait another 365 days to find out more?  The ending, even though it is open ended like all the others, isn't really the cliffhanger we've come to love.  It is a great summer read, but not the best in the series.  Can't wait for #9!
B000003N7K|5.0|The reason I bought this album is because of the piece 'My One and Only Love'.  Its almost the only track of this CD that I listen to, and I also included it in my laptops MP3 library.  I first heard this song on radio some 30 years back and was on the lookout for the LP.  I am happy it came out on CD.<br />If this was a CD single of My One and Only Love, I would still buy this single at the full CD price!  <br />A classic.
B000062TU1|5.0|As a reviewer, I have a tendency to wordiness, and usually look disparagingly at reviews of ten words or less, all in caps, which basically say &quot;WOW!&quot;  This is the first time I have had to struggle with the temptation simply to say something like &quot;ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!  THIS MOVIE WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!  DON'T COME HOME WITHOUT IT!&quot; and leave it at that.  For one thing, it really is that good.  For another, there is so much to say about it that one's mind boggles at trying to keep within a reasonable limit.  Since there will be countless reviews that discuss plot, effects, and individual performances, I will leave those to others, and focus on some things that I found of special note.<br />The first thing that struck me about the film (other than the fact that I was unable to stop staring at my monitor while it was playing) is the sense of 'rightness' one gets while watching.  What I mean by that is, given a book that has way too many events to capture in a film, the production still manages to have delivered everything that was necessary and sufficient to make it seem true to the original.  This may actually be a first in cinematographic history.  Given a tremendous opportunity to tweak or modify the plot or improve on the character the producers have instead remained almost completely faithful to J. K. Rowling's writing and intent.<br />One of the factors in this is the carefully balanced acting.  Given that the title is &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,&quot; it really should be &quot;Harry, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Draco and even the Weasley's AND the Sorcerer's Stone.&quot;  Nobody grandstands, nobody overplays his or her part, and nobody ever goes Hollywood.  Star or part of the background, there is a lack of pretentiousness (except when one is supposed to be pretentious) which makes you really feel like you are looking into the life of a notable student and his friends at Hogwarts.  This invites viewers to immerse themselves in entire tapestry instead of simply hanging on the actions of a particular actor.  And what a tapestry it is!<br />Like the book, the film turns out to be just as meaningful for the old and the young.  The lessons are delivered in easily digestible bits, leaving the flow of the story undisturbed.  Somehow, inside, a part of you knows that maybe, just maybe, you are a little bit better for having watched this film.  Harry's need for family, accomplishment, and self-esteem is no stranger to any of us who seek the courage to face our own 'He Who Shall Not Be Named.'  So 'BRAVO' says this reviewer, 'VERY WELL DONE INDEED.'themselves in entire tapestry instead of simply hanging on the actions of a particular actor.

0312265859|5.0|Ok, so you've waited almost a year to read this book.  Well, IMHO, it was well worth the wait.  Hard Eight is a great book.  It has action, adventure, and plenty of the sassy Grandma Mazur.  Stephanie Plum is back with a vengence.  Without spoiling it for everybody, I would just like to say that a lot of people will be happy with the pairings in this book.  I will say that Eight is probably the most intense book in the series.  Near the end, things take a pretty violent twist, and I was suprised how things turned out.  All I can say is, I can't wait for Nine.  Most Plum fans will love this book, but of course there will always be a few who don't like it.  Read it for yourself and see how great it is.
B00003CX5P|5.0|While this episode has had it's critic.  We should be reminded this was not intended to be &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.  We should, however, take this movie for what it was &quot;eye candy&quot;!  It does also begin to build nicely the background information we will need to know as our loveable little Anie becomes the villianous Darth Vader.  While the story lines do conflict, occasionally!  Recall in episode V, Obewon tells Luke to seek out Yoda &quot;the Jedi master who instructed me&quot;.  He must have forgot the time he spent with Qwi Gon Jin.  However, we can and should look pass those minor Faux Pauxs and recognize the nearly flawless special effects.  As well as some new and very loveable characters.  Not to mention some interesting social commentary, like a planet that is one very big city.  Think about the palpatations that some of our environmantalist fiends must have had at that thought.  Finally, this is a movie that I am extremely happy to have in my movie library.  I might also add this is a movie that will, I think, stand on it's own as a movie classic in the truest sense of the term.  Ok I'll stop drinking my George Lucas Kool-Aid, but if you want a relaxing evening at home with popcorn, your family or a friend, and a very good family friendly action adventure kinda movie it would be tough to do better.
B000066F6H|5.0|Put simply, this CD is about the primal urge (that is in all of us) to let it all out and let the world know how we feel.  Nothing profound - no great message - no Alanis Morisette, touchy-feely, I hate the world [junk] -  just cartharsis by audio.  Rock on!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is my absolute unquestioned movie of the year.  I honestly do not believe that I have seen a more incredible movie in my lifetime.  The acting was superb, the cast was wonderful, the plot was incredible, and it all came together to create what will no doubt be a cult classic forever.  If you have any doubts about this movie, I can guarantee you, they will be erased upon viewing it.  This movie is as close to perfect as you can get.  Unforgettable.
B00006ADFL|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I plan to get the DVD when it releases.<br />It's been a while since I've seen it, but I do remember hallucinogenic dreamlike sequences that meshed well with the overall plot, which involves two girls from Australia.<br />I don't want to give anything away, suffice it to say that this one's worth at least renting (and owning IMHO).
B00005OAIE|5.0|After listening to this CD for months, I totally appreciate John's talent for writing, guitar playing and singing.  Perhaps Dave Matthews is one of his influences, but Mayer has his own style and his own sound.  I have CDs by both artists, and I'm not confused at all by the two.  I can totally tell them apart.  My whole family enjoys this CD from age 43 down to my 11-year old. Every song is creative, intelligently written and totally enjoyable to listen to.  I can't pick a favorite track, as they all are great.  Everyone that I've had listen to this CD has gone out and bought it too.  Looking forward to Mayer's concert and more music from this bright, rising star.
B00005JL3A|5.0|I wasn't expecting much, knowing this was another one of those based on a game.  But I had hopes, so I went, and I'm glad I did.  This was a horror movie in the ruest sense and of the highest claiber.  If you like a scary, suspenseful, shiver down your back, jump out of your seat movie, you'll like this.  Get it - you won't regret it.  These people are stuck down there which always makes for a good horror movie. To that add some vile zombies...like the night of the living dead, and viola! And best of all - it's made by the same guy who made \\"Event Horizon\\".  If you liked that, you'll like this, and if you never saw it, SEE IT!
B00005AXEL|5.0|I have been in love with Stevie's work for many years. This album was well worth the wait. The songs on this album worked very well togther. They complimented each other to the point of being AWESOME!! I listen ot this cd at least once a day if not more. You truly have to be a Stevie fan after this album came out.
B00005K3OT|3.0|Not as good as I hoped.  Let me preface my review with the cuation that this is not the sort of movie I ususally like or watch.  However, I thought I would give it a try becuase I really like the actors and it was nominated for so many awards.  The english patient isn't my type of movie, but i gave it a shot becuase it won so many awards and i had liked it, so i hoped that might be the case this time.  However, (despite the fact that Depp is in it!) this movie was rather lukewarm.  It seemed somewhat mundane and unfocused.  I saw it maybe half a year ago and nothing jumps out at me about it.  It's pretty forgetable.  So, if you like sentimental romances, you might like this.  If you like something that has a good plot and a backbone, don't go there.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Dogma is director Kevin Smith's 4th movie feauring his and Jason Mewes' characters, Jay, and Silent Bob, since his directorial debut in the movie business with his independent film, ''Clerks'', which became a cult classic.<br />   Like Smith's previous cross-genre film, ''Chasing Amy'',which crossed the genres of comedy and romance, Dogma crossed Comedy with Fantasy, with a winning plot about a decsendent of Jesus Christ who has lost her faith (Linda Fiorentino), who must stop two fallen angels (Afleck and Damon) from reentering heaven via a loophole that they have found, which would destroy humanity.<br />    Chris Rock plays Fiorentino's guide and side kick, Rufus the 13th apostle who was left out of the bible and looking for some changes to be made. Mewes and Smith who reprise there roles as stoner pals, Jay and Silent Bob, also tag along.<br />    Very funny, and Very fun, Dogma is a  film that should not be missed.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Pure genius - this album will either be completely loved or completely dismissed, but the message is clear: Life is short, and you've gotta grab it by the horns.  Check out Andrew's opening statement [on the web]- it's not just an album about partying in the physical sense, but intoxication at a different level.  His music strives to evoke change, and whether the vehicle is accepted or not, its a heck-of-a-lot more of an attempt than 95% of the music out there today.  Sure, our generation has angst and apathy, but \\"Get Wet\\" pushes that aside for a more simplistic take on life:  DIVE IN! live every moment to the fullest you can, love all, strive to leave your positive mark on the world.  Musically, it's basic, ideologically, it's basic, but damn if it doesn't just deliver the message in a way that makes you actually look forward to rocking-out to this CD again and again...
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril is the best singer out right now and maybe for a while.  She has great ability to write songs and you can tell that by listening to her cd.  Her voice will catch your attention real fast and make you want to listen to her cd all day.  The band is great and all the guitar and drum and bass parts match her voice.  All i really want to say is don't miss this CD.
B000009HF2|5.0|Take it from someone who was there at Winterland in 1976, the audience track is not faked!  That evening was magical the crowd was definitely in tune with the man and his band, and we were all so blown away by what we were hearing that night it only makes sense that the crowd sounds sweetened to you.  The sound engineers did a masterful and up until that time unachieved level of perfection in capturing the real sounds of a live performance.  That is why the album sold so well, it does not have the hollow sound of typical live performances.  His guitar was ringing loud and clear that night as was his voice.  It is such a pleasure to be able to listen to a live perfomance that ranks as one of the best concerts I have ever been to, (and believe me I have been to a lot of them) any time I want to, and be able to relive that very special performance in San Francisco.  Thank God they recorded this show!
1590710037|4.0|If \\"The War of Art\\" did not have a shiny, stainless-steel-like cover, my eye might not have happened upon it, in a local bookstore, on a table loaded with the newest paperback fiction. I felt an urge to pick the book up, much in the way that a raccoon might pick up bits of shiny gum-wrapper aluminum or silver coins. I read the title and laughed, then caught my own eye in one of the tiny inlaid mirrors which also adorn the cover. It was as if the Muse herself had taken the book off its prescribed shelf and placed it in front of me on that stack of paperback fiction.<br />Why was I in that bookstore in the first place? Diversion. This book seemed to promise that, and more. Reading the foreword by Robert McKee, I realized this book might be for me. I, too, hold Olympic records at procrastination. I, too, require an external deadline if I am to be expected to produce work. I, too, am a creature of instant gratification. But when I started to read the author's musings on Resistance, I put the book down and walked away from it quickly, feeling like it was dangerous to read on. Alas, six months have gone by and my novel is still in note form. Which is why I was spending time browsing bookstores. Which is why I found this book. While walking away from this book was the easiest thing in the world, actually buying it was difficult, but I beat the excuses away ...I have more books than I can read; I don't want to face the book's truths, etc.) and purchased the darn thing right there and then. <br />Argggg, this book! On each page, I found something to laugh at, something to learn from, and such raw truth that I found myself fighting Resistance just to read on. Pressfield makes the argument Resistance is the Enemy! Resistance is the name for what I did not even know I was battling with. It will isolate you, will force you to crave the very things that keep you from your work: instant gratification, rationalization, and procrastination. But how to overcome the power of Resistance? Read This Book. Pressfield proves that Resistance can be beaten by your turning Pro, facing your fears, showing up, putting in a good day's work. The true test of \\"The War of Art\\" is whether or not I'll be able to put the advice and truth to good work and start to write in earnest, really get to work, on my novel. For Pressman promises, and I believe it to be true, that \\"when we conceive an enterprise and commit to it in the face of our fears, something wonderful happens.\\"
0385334206|5.0|Although not his most popular work, this is in my opinion Vonnegut's most brilliant novel. Superficially it seems childish, with it's inane illustrations (by the author) and rambling, seemingly unstructured text. But probe a little deeper and some truly profound insights emerge, and there is litle doubt that this is a work of carefully crafted, absolute genius.<br />There are at least four main themes in this book, and the way Vonnegut weaves them together is both masterful and unorthodox. (In no particular order) the first theme is of madness - Dwayne Hoover has finally fallen victim to the chemicals in his brain, and much of the narrative unfolds around his descent into lunacy and violence. The second theme is that of the alienation of modern-day life, as a despairing Kilgore Trout makes his &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot; across small-town USA, and Wayne Hoobler spends the novel waiting pathetically for his dreams to come true while standing by a Holiday Inn dumpster. The third theme is on the meaning of all art, both in Rabo Karabekian's stunning exposition on modern painting, and on Vonnegut's own musings about the point of writing a novel (which occurs within the narrative). <br />And the final theme, binding it all together, is that of love and connection. As is found in many of Vonnegut's works, he argues that the giving and receiving of love is the only thing that makes our otherwise meaningless lives valuable. Many people miss this point when they read Vonnegut, and hence come away feeling Vonnegut is a very bitter man. If you see this, you'll discover he is actually a deeply compassionate one. <br />I have read this book many times, and each time come away with a new insight. Read it and treasure it.
0312265859|5.0|Evanovich continues to deliver the funny escapades of Stephanie Plum.  Each novel introduces new characters that enhance an already great cast.  Hard Eight is no exception.  As I read this one I kept thinking these things would only happen to Stephanie.  Evanovich keeps coming up with antics that could only happen in her novels and make you buy into them.  Nothing about these novels seem contrived or manipulated, just good fun.  I can't wait to read number nine.  A year is tooo long a wait for news of Stephanie.
0767903862|5.0|I bought this book in England, at the airport, for something to read on the way home.  Having traveled to Australia a few years ago, I thought it would be nice to read someone else's impressions of the country.  I loved it!  Some parts had me laughing out loud so hard I was crying (which I am sure the flight attendants thought strange) while insights about the treatment of the Aborigines inspired some serious reflection.  This is not a 'how-to' guide for planning a trip to Oz, but it is wonderful at giving gut reactions, background information and history, as well as the pure, honest emotions involved in traveling somewhere far from home.  So, after talking to your travel agent and reading Fodor's or Lonely Planet's guides... read Bryson before boarding the plane.  And if you fly into Sydney, you will know more than the locals about Kingston Smith, for whom the airport is named!  Even if you aren't bound for Down Under, Bryson can transport you through the sights, sounds, and conversations that he reports so well.
0312265859|4.0|I gobbled up this book last night and had laughs, grins and giggles throughout the reading! Stephanie does it again and again and again - getting into trouble. And with the support characters, a new one is introduced who is so much fun, and the sexual tension tightly strung and I can almost not wait for #9. Ranger is a hot hunk and Joe is a hot hunk - which one should Stephanie ultimately be with? Grandma Mazur, while having a minor role in this book, is still a delight. Sis Valerie has a bigger role and is a hoot! Lula - ahhh, Lula. What great fun!!! I think all the fans of Stephanie will enjoy this book. Come on #9!

Ms. Quested and Mrs. Moore are the typical new arrivals, and they desire to see more of the \\"real\\" India than they can see with their fellow Brits, who tend to gather in the state Club and socialize only with each other.  They become involved with Dr. Aziz, a local Indian physician, who promises to show them the famous, nearby Marabar caves.  Dr. Aziz is solicitous toward the Brits and craves their friendship, but he clearly has negative feelings toward them also.<br /><br />At the Marabar caves, an incident occurs (or does not occur) to Ms. Quested that alters all of the characters and their town inextricably.  There is a trial and a bit of a mystery, but the focus is always on the characters and their conflicts.  In particular, the tension between the English and the people of India is beautifully portrayed.  The characters are multi-dimensional, as are their motives, which makes for a fascinating read.  I found the book to be quite moving and sad - a true classic.
6305718954|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie ever made.  The acting is horrible and the script is horrible.  2 hours of my life I will never get back.  What a waste of time!  I wouldn't even rate it one star if I could! It's just that bad.
B000063UR2|3.0|I was really looking forward to the director's cut DVD in this 2-DVD set.  I was stunned.  But not in a good way.  There is really terrible lip-sync for about the first 15 minutes.  And throughout the entire film there are bad frame tearing problems, due to either a bad video transfer or a crummy encoding process.  I haven't looked at the movie on the other DVD yet, but the production quality on the director's cut was a severe disappointment.  I'd rate this a 2 (or even a 1) on DVD production values.<br />On the plus side, the score is excellent. (I like both scores, but had never heard the Goldschmidt score before.)  The director's commentary is decent, and there is a decent assortment of &quot;extra&quot; bits.  I'd rate this a 4+ for &quot;DVD extras&quot;.<br />And, of course, the movie is Legend.  You'll have to rate that part of the content according to your own taste.  :-)
0553381709|2.0|I praised the first two book in the series for Martins' ability to tell a historical-fantasy and make it the most gripping story I have ever read. Despite the constant use of this phrase I believed at first Martin truely was the Tolkein of our era, however how can one continue reading a story if we are left with shallow characters who simply cannot relate too. When the characters we cared so much about are gone?<br />During this novel Martin murdered nearly half of the characaters that kept the story going. Though some of them had the tendency to do things that frustrated us. It was our attatchment to them that kept us coming back.  Like in reality members of our own family, do things that frustrate us more than we can stand, however our love for them keeps us coming back. That what Martin managed to do within the first book.<br />During the first half of the novel one found themselves  feeling as if they truely are related to the family that is staring in the novel. Martin managed to fully accomplish what so many writers failed to do which since Tolkeins time, which is draw us into a plot so deeply one has a hard time adjusting to the real world we all live in. How many authors alive today can truely boast that of their readers? <br />I must reccomend the first two books in the series but not the third. Martin simply falls short of what could have been an epic that could have crushed Jordan into the dusty.
B0000029DD|5.0|We are living in the nadir of the musical evolution. Invaded by inconsequential, disposable pop trash every minute, it's not a surprise that people are turning back to the older days, back when music meant something. A CD that needs more sales behind its intense cult popularity is the debut - and last - longplayer by the late Jeff Buckley. It's sad that he was taken before he could ever really make a solid impact on the music world as he very well could have. There is simply not enough music he left behind to properly mark him as a genius, but believe you me, he would have been huge. I don't really feel I could do justice to the melodies, and the incomprehensibly rich vocal talents of Buckley with words, so I'll make mine wise ones: get this CD. If you hear it twice, you'll never forget it. Brilliant, and a blooming talent that's very sorely missed.
6304118406|4.0|I cannot watch violence, a situation that has greatly hampered my movie-going experience in the last decade or so. And yet I sat through the unspeakable, murderous violence in Oliver Stone's brilliant film without flinching. Why? The more violent and outrageous it got, the more anti-violent the message.<br />Woody Harrelson gives the performance of his career as a serial killer who teams up with a troubled young girl (Juliette Lewis) in a latter-day Bonnie and Clyde murder spree. Stone leaps from satire to serious in a crazy pastiche of images, from Rodney Dangerfield (!!), the girl's sadistic, abusive father who succumbs to one of the most brutal of the depicted murders, to Robert Downey Jr. as a self-important TV journalist whose docudrama on the two killers ends up hero worship.<br />Jumping crazily from angst to brutality to tragedy to high camp, this film manages to put violence in its place by laying bare its sheer madness. This is an unforgettable film. I know Stone has taken a lot of heat for his self-indulgence, but in this case, I think it works perfectly.
B00005JKNC|3.0|The ghost of Frank Capra haunts every frame of \\"THE MAJESTIC,\\" Frank Darabont's paean to American innocence and movies with a capitol M.<br />Jim Carrey is Peter Appleton, a naive, B-movie screenwriter who can't find work because of threats from the infamous blacklist. When he takes a drive up the coast, has an accident and loses his memory he is embraced by a small town as its long lost war hero. He inherits a beautiful fiance and a loving father.<br />Complications ensue when his memory and true identity return about the time he is found, fingered and branded by the House Un-American Activities Committee as a commie on the lam.  Carrey is terrific as the archetypal, 1950s movie-loving American who is drifting along with undeserved good fortune but is forced to either discover his true, moral self or take the easy way out.  Martin Landau is touching as the man who thinks Carrey is his son.  And Sandra Sinclair is just right as the wanting to believe but not quite convinced girlfriend.<br />This beautiful, involving and surprisingly intimate movie is much better on the home screen than in the theater. Unfortunately, this supremely well-crafted production so strongly evokes \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\\" \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" and \\"Sullivan's Travels\\" that there is a palpable patina of deja vu that greatly detracts from what should be total absorption in this otherwise heartwarming tale.  And yes, Jim Carry is amazing playing a real human being for a change. Limited extras on the disc include the full sequence of \\"Sand Pirates of the Sahara,\\" the movie within the movie as written by Carrey's Appleton. All in all, definitely worth seeing.
0783228457|5.0|An adventurous film, one filled with strangely compelling sounds and images - more than worthy of the praise it receives here. I'd like to add that Videdrome's theatrical trailer (included on the dvd) is a masterpiece. It fits like a glove and demonstrates the kind of creative brilliance that exposes today's big-budget, market-tie-in, jump-cut, overloaded, scene-spoiling previews for the trash that they are.
B0000640VN|3.0|Meg Ryan may be the queen of chick flicks, but &quot;KATE &amp; LEOPOLD&quot;<br />is a surprisingly entertaining romance that has just enough comic and sci-fi elements to make it accessible to guys.<br />Although the story evokes the familiar time travel formulas used in &quot;Time After Time&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time,&quot; director James Mangold wisely avoids too much explanation other than a &quot;time portal&quot; in bringing the chivalrous Duke of Albany (Hugh Jackman) from 1876 to present day New York where he falls in love with advertising exec Kate (Meg Ryan).  Romance itself is idealized in Leopold's kindly and respectful treatment of Kate whose ex boyfriend (Liev Schreiber) is Leopold's great, great grandson (and responsible for bringing Leopold to the present).<br />Instead of laughing at the quaint notions of 19th century gallantry, they suddenly seem quite valid and desirable making the ordinary casualness of our dating customs and easily disposable relationships seem quite tawdry by comparison.  The production values are of the highest order and the brief scenes in 1876 New York at the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge have a gorgeous painterly quality.<br />The underlying premise that only Love can conquer Time is a universal longing that permeates this heartwarming film.  Familiar and still fresh.  A pleasant diversion.
0425170349|5.0|Anyone with the time will want to read this 900 page book.  There are just so many reasons to.  Whether it be an engrossing storyline your after, the knowledge of a few new guns, or graphical explanations of people getting their head shot off.  This book tells the epic tale of a top secret military service that travels around the world stopping hostage events, or other terrorist plans.  ...  Do they make it in time? You'll have to read the story to find out....
0790736039|3.0|First off, realize that there's NO way the bulk of this nearly 1100-page book would be transferred to a made-for-TV movie, both because of length AND content.  That being considered, they did a fair job.  I was surprised, though, that such far-reaching swaths of material and characters were entirely eliminated from the film.  It's unfortunate that the characters that were shown were not developed more fully in the movie because I thought their job of casting was fantastic.  I remember when this movie first came out, I read the cast list and just shook my head.  Tim Reid -- aka Venus Flytrap from \\"WKRP in Cincinnati\\" ... Harry Anderson -- from \\"Night Court\\" ... John Ritter -- can he ever shake the Jack Tripper stigma? ... and JOHN-BOY WALTON!?!?  What were these people thinking??  I was dead wrong.  The casting was fantastic -- they just needed a more in-depth script to work with.  I particularly liked how eerily similar the child actors were to their adult counterparts, especially the young actress who portrayed Beverly Marsh (Annette O'Toole as an adult).  The child actors did a terrific job, I thought.  To me, this was the central part of the story -- the relationship these children forged with each other in order to do battle with this monster.  All in all, the movie was a highly-sanitized version of the book, and only the ending was completely cheesy.  A giant spider puppet is supposed to be the eternal embodiment of evil?  Things like this are best left to the reader's imagination -- they often don't translate well onto the screen.  Also, I didn't think Henry Bowers came across as truly malevolent, as he did in the book... he was just an obnoxious school bully in the movie.  While it's definitely an enjoyable story to watch on the small screen, I think it could have easily benefitted tremendously from an additional segment or two (making it into a true three- or four-part \\"mini-series\\" rather than a single lengthy movie cut into two parts and sprinkled liberally with commercials).  The book is one of my favorites of all time, and it would have been great to see a movie that did it true justice.  Something on the order of \\"Roots\\" or \\"The Thorn Birds\\" would have worked wonderfully with this story.
B0000508U6|3.0|I bought this cd quite some time ago on the pretext that it was similar in sound to Radiohead.  People could not have been more off.  Chris Martin's voice mixed with the deep, acoustic, saddening &quot;love is lost&quot; theme of the cd provides for a couple of hours of extended play.  After that it will be few and rare moments when you will actually feel enticed to let this cd run its course. <BR>     Granted some of the songs are amazing such as Don't Panic, shiver, yellow, we never change, and my personal favorite Sparks, but you still can't help but feel bored by the juvenille approach Chris Martin used when writing the lyrics for these songs.  Let's face it people, going into the 00's mood music has been drastically altered. If you want a lasting cd the lyrics have to be well thought out, immerse you into the music, and provide a bridge that relates you directly to the cd on some level deeper then just the veneer.  The majority of the songs on this CD though leave you with a feeling that you are listening to the poems of an early highschool kid. <BR>     Overall I felt inclined to give this cd 3 stars even though I think it can be a 4 star cd for a lot of people.  The main attraction I had to this cd was the constant hints of how this band performed close to Radiohead.  Besides the very nice voice of the lead singer I really see nothing that remotely relates to the talent dished out by Radiohead.  That combined with the adolescent sound of the lyrics just brought the cd value way down for me.  <BR>    I have many other friends that have bought this cd and shared the same complaints that I have voiced, so if you are looking for a cd that will constantly see action you may want to veer away from this one. If you are just looking for some deeply saddening songs of relationship despair, that can be listened to every once in awhile, you will have no problem liking this cd.
B00005ASOI|2.0|and FLUNKS! I haven't seen acting this bad outside of a porn film. The plot is laughably lifted from many other films and held together by, well, nothing. It's no wonder Jessica Harper has disappeared. And Joan Bennet's performance makes her turn on Dark Shadows look award-worthy. Really!<br />Visually, it's wild to look at ... kind of like a whorehouse in Querelle or a Ken Russell daydream. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD.<br />And scary ... Not At All. The only frightening thing is the bizarre adoration some people have for this movie.<br />Artsy for those who haven't seen any real art films.
B000002VSN|5.0|When you hear the words...&quot;Whitney Houson singing gospel&quot; you might cringe. But don't. This is one of Houston's best performances ever. It has more feeling than all of her previous releases. The highlight &quot;I Love The Lord&quot;, it will make the hairs on your arm stand up. &quot;I Believe In You And Me&quot; is a great ballad that reconnected Whitney with David Foster, the producer of &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, and &quot;Run To You&quot;. &quot;Step By Step&quot; is a great dance song, featuring Annie Lennox on background vocals. &quot;You Were Loved&quot; is a laid back, heartfelt ballad, classic Whitney. &quot;My Heart Is Calling&quot; is a R&amp;B song with a great beat and real soul. You also can't skip &quot;All Over Me&quot; a duet with Gospel legand Shirely Ceasar. <br />I advise all Gospel, R&amp;B, and Whitney fans to buy this CD.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Not up to the standard of Silence of the Lambs, but an interesting foree into the genre for Ridley Scott nevertheless.  It's always fun to see Anthony Hopkins in his homicidal character. :)
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is the best example of the merging of Roger's lyrics with the lengthy Pink Floyd musical explorations that this band ever recorded. Animals is simply the perfect balance between  lyrics and music. Sure, Dogs is a long song, but it also has a lot to say. But the words don't overwhelm the music just as the music doesn't overwhelm the words. Both seem to work so well together that they are an absolute perfect fit, forming an integral element of a whole. From the snapping sounds of the dogs in Gilmour's middle solo during the song Dogs, to the gentle opening of the dimly aware Sheep that suddenly get disturbed abruptly when the words come screaming in, there is a lyrical sense to the music that has never been quite achieved before or since. Even the middle talkbox solo during the song Pigs (Three Different Ones) is as much a guitar solo as it is Gilmour singing, like a pig, the four letter word over and over ( occasionally adding the word &quot;you!&quot; afterward). <BR>A true masterpiece.
B00005RIKD|1.0|It is nothing but crap!!!  Sting is full of himself on this one!!!
B0000399WI|5.0|Without a doubt, probably the best prison film of all time.  Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) is accused of murdering his wife and the guy she was cheating on Andy with.  He is found guilty and sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  While in prison he meets Morgan Freeman, a fellow inmate.  They become best friends and go through a whole series of events together in prison.  The ending is the most moving part of the whole movie, what Morgan says at the end just makes you stop and think about life.  This is a truly moving movie.  Unfortunatley, though nominated for some Oscars like, Best Actor(Morgan Freeman), Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.  However no winners at all.  Because of only one movie, Forrest Gump.  It took just about every Oscar that Shawshank was up for.  If you have not seen this movie, rent it, you will never forget this movie, it is a moving experince.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|All I could think of was the old movies I watched growing up and what would have happened to them if they were turned into music videos. It's almost hard to describe without actually EXPERIENCING it. Take a hit of acid and then switch channels back and forth between Camille and Cabaret. Actually, that's not a bad thing! I was never bored and really enjoyed the sentiment behind the whole thing. There is a great sweetness disguised behind the lurid colors, camera work and oft told- cheesy love story. McGregor is awesome and steals the film. What a charmer he turns out to be.
B000002VMD|5.0|The Bodyguard Soundtrack has sold over 33 million copied worldwide since its release, making it one of the biggest selling CD's ever. In America, it is the best selling Soundtrack of all time. <br />The album is dominated by music from Whitney Houson. Her cover of Dolly Parton's &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; has become one of the most loved songs ever and the winner of two Grammy Awards. It is my personal all time favorite. Other big hits include the Oscar nominated &quot;I Have Nothing&quot; and &quot;Run To You&quot;. Also included are two #1 Dance hits &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; and &quot;Queen of the Night&quot;. This album won the Album of the Year Grammy back in 1994 and is a must have for any music fan.
B00005QZWI|4.0|I am shocked by the people that dare to compare the Lord of the Rings soundtrack to John Williams.  First of all, I must say that I am a huge fan of film music, and John Williams is without a doubt one of my favorite composers.  He is a master at creating melodies that are really masterfully integrated into a soundtrack so that it is seamless and extremely cohesive.<BR>      That said, I would like to comment on the unjust comparison that someone said (notably the reviewer from Milwaukee) about how Peter Jackson should have approached John Williams instead of Howard Shore.  Certainly, when it was announced that Shore would do the music, many film music fans raised their eyebrows and said &quot;could you repeat that?&quot;  But given the results, all harsh critics are (or at least should) be overjoyed at the completed score.  I am always happy when an underrated composer (which certainly would have described Howard Shore as of a year ago) gets the chance to stun the audience with an emotional score, which is exactly what Shore did.  I am amazed that someone can say the job should have been given to John Williams -- John Williams has huge blockbuster scores to do every year, how many do you think Howard Shore has had in his entire career of over a decade?<BR>      And on the subject of the Oscars, I am very glad LotR won, it was without a doubt the best score of the year.  In second place would by John Williams' A.I., which is also an exceptional score, even if it lacks the scale of LotR.  On a side note, John Williams' second nomination (Harry Potter) should not have been nominated, it was not a very good score.<BR>      For those of you wondering why the 4-star rating, it is simply because of the deplorable advertising used including the computer pop-ups screens which were unnecessary and irritating, the over-publicity about Enya used in the selling of the album, and the disgusting &quot;Limited Edition&quot; and wacko pricings that the record company has used withthe retailers.
0671027344|1.0|I thought this was one of the worst books I had ever read. The author used shock tactics to try to make his points, but he ended up writing a book that tells me he has no idea what the youth of the time period were doing. He uses drugs and sex to draw an audience, but the people who are drawn to such stories will be impervious to the points Chbosky is trying to make. Furthermore one has to wander what IS the point he's trying to get across? That abuse is inheritted? Or is it a coming of age story with a severly troubled teen who can still get high, drunk, and laid with the best of them? No maybe it's a love story that was never meant to be due to the triangle of mixed emotions and sexual roles. Whatever the purpose it was missed, lost, or maybe forgotten in the rush to fill the book with the jumble of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
B000002UA0|1.0|Syd Barret is NOT a genius. A genius would figure out how to survive mental illness. Pink Floyd made a career out of one mans madness. Roger Waters has been telling us for years that \\"Syd is a genius so listen to my stories about him\\". Roger made a million selling Syd's story. But one listen to this album and you'll realize that 'THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES' We've been told so many times that the Syd Barret Pink Floyd period is 'pure genius' that we almost start to believe it without ever listening to a single note of the music made with him. I'm sorry Floydians, but I don't get it. Just because is hasn't been done before does'nt make it good. These songs would have drove me nuts too if I had to rehearse them over and over. I think that's why Syd has gone mad. He [stinks] and he knew it then.
B000066NW0|5.0|I bought Avril's cd as soon as it hit shelves cuz I had already found myself addicted to \\"Complicated\\" <BR>She's an awesome singer, plays her own instrument and is from CANADA! (like myself!) And she's only 17! (also like myself!)<BR>Here's a run down of the tracks in case anyone out there doesn't already have a copy of Avril's 'Let Go'<BR>1. 'Losing Grip' - heavy rock tune about dealing with life and boys...one line has been my msn name for the past 2 weeks<BR>2. 'Complicated' - if you haven't already heard this one...get out from under your rock!... A great song.<BR>3. 'Sk8er Boi' - A little storyline with awesome punk sound. A great song to jump around and jam to!<BR>4. 'I'm with you' - more mellow but just as awesome as the first three tracks<BR>5. 'Mobile' - a great song with a little bit about how Avril must feel with her new found celebrity status<BR>6. 'Unwanted' - another hard rock song...about being left behind and unwanted essentially...great to crank on the stereo when you're just in one of those moods<BR>7. 'Tomorrow' - a song for the girls...mellow again but great<BR>8. 'Anything but Ordinary' - the title itself screams Avril....an awesome song<BR>9. 'Things I'll never say' - a song about relationships and havin' a crush (how can we not relate to that!)<BR>10. 'My World' - a catchy tune about Avril's world....and she even mentions Napanee Ontario in it!<BR>11. 'Nobody's Fool' - Avril throws a little bit of rappin in...but the diversity is a great mix for the album...very catchy<br />12. 'Too Much to Ask' - a song for the girls....boys..can't live with em, can't live without em<BR>13. 'Naked' - a song about finding that special someone (I hope everyone has more luck with that than I've been having!). And another great single.<br />Overall: a must buy definitely....Avril rocks!...
0767836286|4.0|This is a fun thriller with a devastating makes-you-think twist that is rises above your formulaic action pic.<br />Bridges is always very good, different for Robbins, and Joan Cusack stole the best of the \\"Stepford Wives\\" for her part.<br />Exciting, tense, a frightening shocker of an ending and characters who are all very flawed and not always likable. A realistic approach that helped to make it a little less of the clean-cut good vs. bad deal.<br />Give it a shot.
B000066C1N|5.0|The Spirit soundtrack is brilliant!  The songs capture the &quot;spirit&quot; of the movie and no one can excuse the fantastic, distinctive voice of Bryan! I can't stop listening to it!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|I never thought it possible, but the unfortunate length (157 minutes) and the pacing of Michael Mann's film bogs down the story of a sports icon who may never be matched in the sheer amount of charisma he possessed.  I'm a big fan of Michael Mann's - from the Miami Vice days to Last of the Mohicans to The Insider.  His visual and sound vision were clearly present in this film, and his script and the caliber of his stars clearly produced some fine individual moments and some excellent performances.  But, in trying to cover too much ground, Mann never clearly establishes a compelling single story line, and doesn't spend enough time revealing the connection (pro and con) between Ali and the American public.  Ali always kept you guessing.  Was it real, or was it Ali performing for the cameras?<br />As much as I enjoyed the boxing scenes, they probably did the most to drag the movie out too long....and I would have preferred more Liston and Frazier, and done Foreman only anecdotally.  The same with his marriages....more anecdotally, since none of the relationships was really allowed to evolve on film (although it would have been a shame to miss Nona Gay, as wife Belinda; she was superb). Individual performances were striking, with Jon Voight in a career caricature as Howard Cosell, a tremendous performance by Jamie Foxx as Bundini, and brief but memorable cameos by Ron Silver and Giancarlo Esposito.  And Will Smith?  This was a really fine performance in a role that would have scared many actors.  He truly studied his role and exacted everything he was capable of in the film.  Was it worth an Academy Award nomination - I think not, but I now believe he's capable of making a real run for it in a future role.<br />Pound for pound, I preferred \\"The Hurricane\\".
B00005K3OT|1.0|I liked this movie better when it was called &quot;Footloose.&quot;  It wasn't nearly as pretentious.
B00005Q4ED|2.0|There have been many mediocre-to-awful \\"Jane Eyre\\"s, and this is one of them. No, Mr. Rochester is not meant to be conventionally handsome, in an era when handsome meant a \\"Grecian\\" profile and blond curls. He should not be, however, devoid of all charisma and positively unattractive. Of the various actors who have portrayed him, Orson Welles best fits the book's description, down to the glowing black eyes, but George C. Scott does not even come close, in face, voice or demeanor. And as various people have already pointed out, Susanna York was both too old and too conventionally attractive for Jane. When neither of the principals fits the role, the story simply cannot work. The one thing this version has going for it is a hauntingly beautiful score, which I am fortunate to own on CD, and which contains some of the most lovely titles I know. Its charm and simplicity would be a complete revelation to those who only know John Williams' work through his scoring of Spielberg epics. If you want a version that is faithful to the book and beautifully acted, then by all means wait for the version with Timothy Dalton as Rochester; he may be too handsome (but then again, perhaps not when contrasted to the \\"blond god\\" Victorian ideal), but he acts Rochester to the core, and his scene with Jane when she finally emerges from her room, following the revelation, is both breathtakingly romantic and amazingly sexy. Zelah Clarke as Jane is indeed small and plain and passionate, and they make a perfect match. It is too bad that Williams' score could not have been adapted for that version!
B00005JKCF|5.0|Every year there's at least one big blockbuster.  It may only be June but it's here already in 'Spiderman', the adaptation of the comic-book character.  A movie brimming with character, stunning special effects and a cluster of great actors, it's understandable why it's become such a hit.<br />The movie starts with the perhaps controversial casting of Maguire in the central role as nerdy Peter Parker.  He's dull, geeky and in love with the girl-next-door (Dunst).  One day though, after being bitten by a genetically-modified spider he becomes Spiderman, superhero to the people of New York.  Fortunately Maguire works not only as Parker, as we'd all expected him to, but also as Spiderman.  Anyone who's seen him as a disaffected teen in 'The Ice Storm' will know that he's a fantastic actor and he really does pull it off with incredible panache here.  The most important thing is that Spiderman/Parker and Maguire are so easy to relate to.  He's picked on with no friends and there won't be a single person who isn't rooting for him when he finally gets to beat up Flash, the school bully and domineering boyfriend of Dunst's Mary Jane.<br />Of course, the rest of the cast are perfect as well.  Dunst is just adorable, although hopefully she won't be typecast after hitting the big league with this movie.  Dafoe is equally good as Spiderman's nemesis, The Green Goblin.  The idea of the split personality as we watch him effectively battle himself in front of a mirror is very good indeed.  Yet the real star is undoubtedly Maguire, who gets to do a whole range of emotions from nerdy to strong to sad, all of which he handles well.<br />Significantly this is a movie that doesn't stint on either the action or the metaphor.  Every action scene is stunningly produced as Spiderman makes New York his jungle playground, jumping from rooftop to rooftop and swinging from buildings.  Yet the metaphor of adolesence is trodden out with care, and there's even some discussion of what it means tobe a superhero.  For instance, the people turn against him and Parker realises that being a hero means distancing, even losing, the ones that he loved.  Indeed, the ending is particularly impressive in that it's utterly unexpected.<br />All of this and it is a true blockbuster, managing to balance stunning action scenes with romance, sadness and light humour.  Watch out for the upside-down kissing scene, surely one of the best movie kisses of all time.  Here is a superhero that the audience can relate to, presented in a movie that plays it straight rather than cartoonish.  Importantly, it makes you anticipate the sequel with bated breath.
1881273156|5.0|This book was well written and easy to read. The material was insightful and applicable to real life, whether you are married or not. Chapman doesn't pretend to have easy answers and doesn't get bogged down in his examples. <br />His theory is easy to understand and can be used to improve any relationship. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to strengthen a relationship before, during, or after rough spots! It is a quick read that can radically improve your state of mind and bless your significant other!

This is my favourite in the Max trio, but sadly unavailable on DVD in Australia (go figure that out - we can buy the other two but not this one despite it being an Aussie film!).  Thankfully a friend picked it up for me overseas, and what you will first notice is the superb picture quality!  But it was always a good picture qualuity actually - I have a video version too and that is outstanding quality. In fact, sometimes videos can be just as good qulaity as DVD's.<BR>Enjoy this film, it will make you swirm, smile and think for three days after!  <BR>I think I am the only person who enjoys this more than the second movie (Mad Max 11, which is strangely titled 'Road Warrior&quot; overseas!)
B00005AWMF|5.0|I was never a big fan of Sade until her newest release LOVERS ROCK came out, took me ashore and then blew me away. I was never one to listen to anything associated with R&B either until Sade opened my doors into the world of neo-soul which just threw me for a loop. It's kind of like R&B except that it's more meaningful and mature. And while many might say that Sade has a voice that is thin and weak I would really like to differ. Her voice is low-key (I'm not gonna lie) but it's deeply sensuous and soultry with a smoky richness that is absolutely stunning. Her musical styling is also very interesting for it consists of smooth jazz (thanks in part to saxaphones and trumpets) with neo-soul (The Sweetest Taboo, No Ordinary Love) and urban beats (Never As Good As The First Time, Cherish The Day) that often sound like the perfect soundtrack for an island party (aka, Smooth Operator, Paradise). There are also some powerful ballads here like Jezebel and the haunting Pearls which often push me back into my chair as to melt into the melody.<br />This is an amazing album and it deserves a spot in everyone's collection.<br />This is highly recommended.
B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeppers Creepers is the best horror film of 2001. After seeing Jeppers Creepers, I rushed upstairs to my computer to review this movie. I could not wait to share what I thought about this movie. This was a great horror movie with alot of freaky things in it. It acually gave me goosebumps several times during the duration of the movie.<BR>    It's about this evil creature who eats peoples body parts and smells them. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was when Darry (Justin Long) got taken away and eventually killed but the evil creature. <BR>   But other than that, this is a must own movie because it is the best horror film of 2001. I give Jeppers Creepers two thumbs up and 5 stars!.
B00005JKGK|4.0|This movie isn't about man bashing. I don't know how anyone could think so given the equal representation of both positive and negative male and female characters.  The movie is, however, very much about cause and effect.  It does a fantastic job of illustrating how each of us is the sum of our experiences.  Each character is a puzzle that's gradually pieced together via flashbacks.  Each strained mother/daughter relationship is amended by the sharing of their own individual histories.  All in all, I'd venture to say the audience is given as much insight into their own personal relationships as the characters are.  For that, I think it's a wonderful movie.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, as it was visually appealing and had an, uh, interesting plot. I did find myself laughing at some of the more predictable scenes though. However the cheesy accents, horrible script, and a very cliched villain are just a few of the good many things wrong with this movie. All in all, I think this a really bad movie, but nonetheless enjoyable. A screenplay like this sounds good in theory, but video game-to-movie transfers take more than just a large budget.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Bravo to Shakira!! Her first UK album is a surefire hit for me! I first listened to this cd online, and 'Whenever, Wherever' caught my attention immediatley, the panpipes, and slighly dancey feel really drew me to it!! I feel she is trying to cross herself with The Cranberries and Alanis Morrisette, yet she still has a very unique, distinctive tone to all of her songs, and she is identified easily from just a few bars or singing! I song I cannot identify with is 'Que Me Quedes Tu' as it fails to start in my opinion, it is too lathargic and doesn't blend with the rest of the album. All in all this album is one of my favorites from the year and I would indefinatley recommend it to anyone, as it fits into most genres of musical taste.
0312265859|3.0|I enjoyed reading Hard Eight but have to say it's not the best in the series.  All the usual happens, Stephanie blows up a few cars, people are shot and there's a lot of heavy breathing over Morelli but I just didn't enjoy it as much.  Plus after waiting FOREVER to find out what happened between Stephanie and Ranger, it's only barely mentioned when you're well into the book.<br />A new character is introduced that takes Grandma Mazur's place as comic relief.  Let me just say the scene with Klougn(?) and the dryer makes me glad I bought this book. <br />This is a good story in the continuing series but I wouldn't recommend it to any newbies.  Start at the beginning with One for The Money.  If you've enjoyed Stephanie's other adventures, you'll enjoy this one and you know you have to buy it to find out what happened in the bedroom in Seven Up:)
B00003CXWV|1.0|This movie drags. The plot moves slowly. It is typical of movies with an inverted hero, the treatment of the subject is neither innovative nor exciting.<br />The high point is seeing Pee-Wee Herman, Bobcat Goldthwait, and that 21 Jump Street guy doing a hit of coke, all together, off a bar while girls in bikinis play in the pool.<br />Depp struggles with an amusing, forced, and marginal Boston accent. He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.<br />But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced. But it's not an entertaining movie, or even a well-told story.
B00005JKL8|3.0|I went to this movie without many expectations, my boyfriend dragged me to it.  Its an okay action movie with mediocre special effects. The plot though, is another story.  Owen Wilson escapes and dodges what seems like thousands of bullets. I'm all for believing Americans are capable of everything, but  this movie is a bit too unrealistic.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Did I just walk into a middle-aged mans house in 1988? Well, thats what John Mayer makes me feel like.  I wouldn't be surprised at all if Kenny G. made a few guests appearances on this tool's next album. Basically, if you like a Dave Matthews Wannabe who who plays soft-rock inspired by Steve Winward get this. If you are a true music fan who seeks out good and original stuff, don't come near this CD.
6301390725|5.0|Amazing early combination of live action and animation make this video particularly cunning. Angela Lansbury is just perfect as the apprentice witch just learning her trade and David Tomlinson makes a very believable conman. Great for people of all ages.
B0000013G9|5.0|This is definitely one of the best CDs I've ever owned. It's a fabulous effort by one of the top groups of the 1990s. Lisa Lopez was an incredibly talented rapper. She is truly missed. Every song on this CD keeps you groovin'. Among my personal favorites, &quot;Red Light Special&quot; and &quot;Let's Do It Again.&quot; Go out and get this one, even if it is 8 years old, it's an R&amp;B classic. You'll be so glad you did. Have fun!
0553260111|4.0|this book moves as fast as any that i have ever read and it has such a twisted plot that keeps the reader thinking about what happened earlier on in the book.  best spy novel i have ever read.
B00004U8JV|1.0|People, this movie is bad.  Really bad.  &quot;The Lost World&quot; has all the ingredients of a corporate-driven Hollywood sequel: barely-there plot, noisy special-effects, and wasted performances from talented actors.  But the biggest crime of all is that this film is directed by a man who oughtta know better: Speilberg.  I slept through a good part of this movie, waking up only when the dinosaurs were chasing some poor hapless fool.  I've seen all of Speilberg's movies since 1990, and I like all but this one.  Please, oh please, don't even bother to get this.  It's so bad.
B000065U1N|4.0|First let me begin by saying that normally I would give this movie 5 stars, but I am saving that rating for &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; one of the best ever made.  This falls in behind that movie.  <br />I remember when I left the theater after seeing &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; and telling people that it was intense, and the DVD is no different.  The movie works very well in DVD and the picture and sound are both wonderful. <br />As for the story, I think it was a great depiction of what happened in 1993.  As I watched the film, I could not believe that these young men were put into this situation.  There was such a high loss of life, and the film really makes you ask the question, what was it all for?<br />All in all I would say that this was a good movie and I would highly recomend this DVD!
B000002KY8|5.0|. 1999<br />2. Little Red Corvette<br />3. Delirious<br />4. Let's Pretend We're Married<br />5. D.M.S.R.<br />6. Automatic<br /> 7. Something in the Water (Does Not Compute)<br />8. Free<br />9. Lady Cab Driver<br />10. All the Critics Love U in New York<br />11. International Lover<br /><br />The best songs of this group are Lady Cab Driver and International Lover for their complexity and insane grit and eroticism.  What makes these such good songs is what can't be said but is instead implied thru sound alone that makes the songs stand-outs.  I don't exactly dislike Delirious but you have to be in the right mood for it, its so infectiously frothy.  There is a composite strength to all of these tunes that shows a cogent thought of creation which I think is Prince's greatest ability even on albums that aren't such big &quot;hits&quot;.
0140149295|5.0|To read a true 20th century tradgedy look no farther.  an ispiration as it really happened.  i loved the message of what we can overcome if we set out to do so.  Amazing as it shows the very best and the very worst in human nature and i recommend it for all mature readers.  it can be graphic and disturbing but it gets the point across.
B00003CXI1|2.0|I looked forward to this movie so much and when I saw it it made me very angry. For one the begining was a disappointment when they left out the part before Harry came to Privet Drive. Nothing was right at the Dursley's. When they went to the zoo Dudleys friend was supposed to go. When Harry started getting letters they should have had Harry move upstairs. Hagrid is supposed to tell Harry about his parents at the little cabin not at Diagon Alley. When Harry meets Ron that is all wrong. Also Ron is supposed to be almost as tall as the Weasley twins and Percy doesn't look right. When Harry meets Draco is wrong too, they are supposed to first meet at a robe shop and then indroduced on the train not at Hogwarts! There is no Peeves in the movie. I have to admit the Quiditich match is exciting, but aren't there supposed to be two matches. When the see Fluffy Neville is supposed to be with them and its supposed to happen at night.  When Norbet the dragon gets into the picture, the dragon stays with Hagrid awhile and Hermione and Harry take it to the Astrmony tower so Charlie Weasley can take it  to Romania. They, Draco, and Neville get in trouble, but Ron is not with them.  And when they are getting to the stone Hermione solves an important part  of getting there. And Quirrel does not crumble, it was so lame.  I think that all of you who say that the movie goes along with the book so well, I think you need to read the book a little closer. The book is so much better!!!!!!! 5 stars for the Harry Potter books!!!!
0060229357|4.0|The \\"purple crayon\\" series of books are a joy to read for both myself and my toddler.  The stories are truly inventive with a wild twist on Harold forming his own reality.
B000002H6C|4.0|The first time I heard this, I positively hated ...And Justice For All. Now my tastes/intersts in music have expanded, and I can see why fans of old school Metallica (I like old school/&quot;new&quot; Metallica pretty much equally- it's all good) like this album.<BR>Justice features some of the most advanced and deep lyrics Metallica has written to date, amazing guitar riffs, and most of Kirk Hammet's best solos. <BR>The only things I don't like are that the albums sub-par production shows itself occasionally (amateur-ish sounding mastering of songs, improper mixing), and that one or two of the songs STILL sound like a lot of yelling with the guys bashing on guitars. <BR>However, One, Harvester of Sorrow, and the title track more than make up for it.
0451524985|5.0|This story is great in the way it deals with the male -female relationship in a subttle manner.  It is erotic, moving and emotional.  A powerful story and a great look into human nature and the power that sex has in a relationship.  For those whom are interested in understanding the the development in the male and female movements that have grown over the past 100 years.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers I decided I had to have this cd after just a few notes of &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot;.  I described this cd to a friend recently, I said that &quot;it makes me want to just lay around and do absolutely nothing&quot;.  I needed to furthur clarify that though, You know when your lying in bed with someone you love and there is no where else you'ld rather be, that's the way Norah Jones' music makes me feel.
B0000640VO|5.0|A splendid script, an actress who distills Chaplin, Audrey Hepburn, and Marilyn Monroe, the most creative use of digital effects to help the storyline, an effervescent score --- it was criminal that it was denied best foreign film.  Like all of us, Amelie weaves personal mythology and dreamscape into a life which is far more than any exterior observer (all but one, the Glass Man, whose fragile bones keep him indoors painting and repainting a Renoir, while observing her across the way) can imagine. When she discovers a tin box holding some boy's memorabilia from decades back, she decides to return Lost Time to him, and finds that small acts can tilt others' destinies around her in unexpected ways. Also like all of us, when the same forces evidently conspire to give her the perfect invitation to introduce herself to the man she's most attracted to, she weaves an elaborate trail of clues and evasions through Paris, tempting fate with a sort of child's gamble, desperately hoping that destiny will, no matter how much she runs from it, bring them together.<br />  The film is filled with sharp little surprises and sudden laughter as her match-making gambits, her schemes of retribution against the vegetable seller who abuses his retarded assistant, and the plan to get her father to follow in the footsteps of the globe-trotting garden gnome she steals from his garden, all pay off. <br />   This vision of one young woman's inner world and her conspiracy to outwit mundane fate has the dreamlike timelessness that mark the best films ever made. A film that can fill one with warmth and bring a smile to the face just by telling another person about it is very, very rare.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was introduced to Norah Jones while browsing a music story for a Diana Krall cd. The saleman and I started chatting and he reccomnded I listen to Norah Jones. I couldn't have been more impressed! Norah is very different and original. her voice is beautiful and very unique, and her singing style, though catagorized as jazz, is just a little bit different then your stereotypical jazz singer. I'd highly reccomend this cd to any jazz fan!
B000002J5K|5.0|The movie is a classic and i still love watching it, One of the reasons the movie is such a sucess is because the music ties it all together and creates a plot and atmosphere. The songs on this CD are great to listen to and also dont get old. If you are a fan of RnB, Jazz, or any other genres simmilar this will become one of your favorites. and there is a little bit of every taste with some western (&quot;theme from rawhide&quot;) and lots of brass and rhytm peices (&quot;peter gunn theme&quot; for example). The only thing that i dont like is the lack of the song &quot;boom boom&quot; by John Lee Hooker, wich played in full in the movie, and &quot;sooth me&quot; by Sam and Dave wich also was played a while in the movie. but nonetheless this is a great CD to get!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I don't usually listen to this type of music but I heard \\"Come Away With Me\\" and decided to get it and man was I surprised to find that there wasn't a bad song on the entire cd. I have had the cd about a week and haven't listened to anything else and I am planning to go see her in concert in August. She is awesome!
B000001G1E|5.0|I grew up listening to James Brown, but I was never able to really appreciate the power of this music  until I began to study and really LISTEN to music.<br />James Brown is a prodigy. I rank him up there with the greatest musicians of all time, in any genre. Of course musical snobs look down their noses at this sort of music, but I can tell you that after listening to Mozart's Jupiter Symphony (my favorite piece of music on the planet) and then putting on Star Time, I was blown away by the power of Brown's grooves. There is so much life force, so much passion, so much connection in this music. The face of God shows itself in many aspects, from Mozart to Doc Watson and yes, to James Brown.<br />This is seminal music, music with power, inspirationmal music that will lift your spirits. To me, it is timeless and will remain great forever.<br />The two greatest grooves I have ever heard are Brown's &quot;Get Up&quot;, on disc 3, and &quot;Licking Stick&quot; on disc two. It's impossible to decribe in words how the vibration in this music affects you. It's so positive, it just gets me off my chair and into the stratosphere.<br />James Brown said it best:<br />&quot;JAMES BROWN is a concept, a vibration, a dance. It's not me, the man. JAMES BROWN is a freedom I created for all humainty.&quot;<br />This may sound arrogant but it is not. It is a true description of this music. It frees your soul.<br />I have been listening to all kinds of music for almost 40 years, classical, jazz, bluegreass, rock, country and alternative and I can say that James Brown is one of the most important musicians of all time.<br />Duke Ellington said it best 'there are only 2 kinds of music. Good music and bad music.'<br />This is GREAT music!<br />Star Time consists of 4 discs. The first disc is his earlier material. Disk's 2 and 3 contain the most powerful groooves, in my opinion. Dsik 4 is really funky and soulful.<br />James Brown had one of the tightest bands of all-time. The guitarist, you have to hear this cat to believe it. Simply some of the most powerful, pulsating grooves ever recorded. The horns are so together and add a powerful push to the music. All of the horn voicings are elemental and powerful. There are no wasted notes.<br />James Brown and his band know how to play the spaces. If you know music, you know what I'm talking about. Knowing when NOT to play is even more powerful than knowing when to play, and this is the foundation of funk, soul, and any groove no matter what genre you are playing.<br />James Brown's voice and spontaneous lyrics are poetic, powerful, and free. They form the  foundation of rap and hip-hop music. I'm raving on and on but this collection is worth alla that. Just buy it!have to hear this cat to believe it.

0312265859|1.0|I am a devoted fan of Janet's however her material seems very old in this book.  It was extremely predictable (including about how many cars will be destroyed).  <br />One good thing, Stephanie might be getting stronger - I know her Mom is.
0743201140|4.0|&quot;NOW, Discover Your Strengths&quot; is a book that guides you to find out your strengths and build on them instead of your weaknesses.  It is very inspiring because it comes from that you are living the life you are supposed to live.  It's about accepting your life the way it is.  They even have a website associated with the book where you can take a quiz to find out your top 5 strengths. I found this very useful because it gives an outside view as to the way you are living and what you can do to be more effective. This book is spreading a more positive way of looking at your life.  It shows a way to stop trying to repair the flaws in your life from past experiences and just learn to focus on your strengths in the moment.  Which will then give you the space to have a successful life.<br />This goes along with another book that I would recommend titled &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel &amp; Shya Kane.  In this book the authors write about how to have a more successful and satisfying life by living moment by moment. The only thing there is, is right here right now.  It discusses that what ever happened in your past (your story) however bad it was doesn't have anything to do with having a great life!
080013558X|5.0|I don't know why so many people are criticizing this movie, but it proves to be nothing but amazing. The only person who could ever play Annie to perfection would be Aileen Quinn, she was made for the role and the way she performs in this movie just makes Annie come alive. Carol Burnett was so hilarious as the role of Miss Hannigan even my mother agrees that no one else could play the part more beautifully than her. As for Tim Curry as the role of Miss Hannigan's twisted brother Rooster couldn't have done it any better, he really knows how to be an evil character. As for Albert Finney as the role of Oliver Warbucks the selfish millionare well his acting is very believable and he does an amazing job. Finally Ann Reinking as Grace Farell did a beautiful job, her character was so sweet and endearing and just the way she played it was perfect. All in all the songs were just brought to life, the acting was believable, the sets were amazing, the costumes were perfect, this movie has it all.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's album &quot;Let Go&quot; is one the best things out there right now, and this is coming from someone who usually listens to rap music. I saw &quot;complicated&quot; on mtv and loved it.(i also loved avril) I decided to do Avril a favor and got the cd just to support her.  I ended up doing myself the favor.  This cd is just absolutely amazing.  I loved every song on it and so will you. Again, I usually listen to rap so if this cd can appeal to me it can appeal to anyone. So just go out, get the cd, and enjoy!
B00005JKJA|4.0|It's important to note that if this review were based on the movie alone, I'd have given it five stars. I only gave it four stars for one reason: the DVD is a little bare. Perhaps it's because I've've been spoiled by double DVDs with numerous special features, but the lack of special features is a little disappointing. With that said, I still would have given it five stars if that was the only problem. My biggest problem with the DVD is the lack of chapter selection. I'm sure that David Lynch did this for a reason, but it is a step backward towards the days of VHS, and can become quite a pain when you want to view one particular scene, especially with a complex movie like this that challenges the viewer to think.<br />As for the movie itself, I felt that it was absolutely brilliant. I love David Lynch, and I think that this is some of his best work. (You'll have to excuse my brevity, as I'll let the movie speak for itself and I don't want to ruin somebody's experience) The acting is superb. In my opinion, Naomi Watts had the best performance of the year. Lynch is in top form; as always, he does a great job of combining symbols with outstanding camera work that allows you to see what he wants you to without beating you over the head with it. The story is complex, yet a very intriguing riddle. It will most likely require multiple viewings to fully understand and appreciate this film, but it's well worth it; each viewing is as enjoyable as the last (possibly more so). That is the magic gift that David Lynch gives; his films either retain their original interest or increase it upon repeat viewings. This film is a masterpiece, and I recommend that Lynch fans and non-Lynch fans alike buy this DVD. Despite my slight gripes about the DVD, it is one of my favorite movies and the DVD is well worth the money.
B00006690F|5.0|I think this is a fantastic album. but wen asked whether it was better than the previous albums i cannot answer. Eminem has changed his style yet again. this album is far more serious than the previous albums, a friend ask me to play him a light hearted and funny track but i found it hard to choose one. Most of the album like 'White America' 'Solidier''Till I Collaspe' hav good stong beats with agressive lyrics. They contain funny lines but few of the tracks are used completley a big joke. They all hav a serious element to them. (except without me but thats the first single so it dont really count)<br />I was impressed by the fact the eminem has dropped some of his views from other album and ad found new things to rap about.  There is only a few attacks on gays after 'the marshall mather lp' and d12's 'devils night' that contained alot of critisism towards them. He hasnt abandend it, it is obvious that he still has the same views, but he has found new things to rap about.<br />The raps and beats fit together so well in the songs on the this album and he tries more styles of rapping here and sings alot more like on 'Hallie's Song' where he sings for half the song<br />If u r looking for good tracks on the album then:<BR>Say what u say with dre is one hell of a track with a mad beat and a diss on cannibus and dupri.<BR>Actually most the tracks are great, so if u dont hav yet i suggest u go out and get it. if u liked the other albums then get this u will not be dissapointed but remember that it is a different album in many ways to the other.<BR>Peace!
B00005V9IK|5.0|While I know there are better scripted films out there in this genre, I couldn?t help but enjoy this movie despite its predictable plot on the premise that it was intended to make one feel good about ones fellow human beings, and it did.  While it certainly isn't cerebral by any stretch of the imagination, it is a good  family film.  It isn't intended to be a great work of cinematic art, but what it is intended to do it does.  It appeals to the child like desire for good to overcome evil, to the desire of a parent to be able to present himself in a good light to his/her children, to the desire for world harmony in a time when it seems perilously close to wide spread destruction.  As other reviewers point out, there is a little for everyone in this film: a brave, decent, pilot... president; a beautiful black stripper with a heart of gold and her adorable little boy; a computer nerd whose knowledge saves the world; an attractive, muscular, black guy to act the part of a good role model for young males; a wedding; a reconciliation--in fact several; a recovered alcoholic father of three who saves the day and makes his children proud of him again; etc.  This is a film that attempts to fulfill the need for fantasy in all of us.  It does so just as Harry Potter does through wish fulfillment; it just does it with more of a \\"boom.\\"  The film is definitely a catch all that was intended to market well by its broad spectrum approach to story telling, but that doesn't mean that it isn't an entertaining tale none the less.  Like The War of the Worlds it's an \\"us against them\\" sort of film, but unlike the latter, it has it's funny moments, in fact many of them.  Brent Spinner--everybody's favorite synthetic life form--gives a wonderful performance as a slightly off beat and out of step director of Area 51, while Randy Quaid does a brilliant characterization of a derelict and ditzy hero who rises to the occasion once again when duty calls.  Will Smith is constantly getting off witty one liners that seem to capture the moment in pithy humor.  Jeff Goldblum played Jeff Goldblum, just as he always does, but as always too is very entertaining to watch.  My greatest disappointment was the women of the story.  Vivica Fox, as Jasmine, had the most active and interesting role among them, her motivating force being the well being of her little boy and the man she loved.  None of the other women seemed to take an active part in anything.  They seemed just along for the ride,  watching the drama take place in front of them, often showing less involvement than many women do over their favorite soap!  A great disappointment to someone who grew up with Honey West, Emma Peel, the Girl from Uncle and other examples of active female participation in action adventures.  The fine CGI finale makes one  want to \\"salute the flag,\\" at least of the United Nations, as humanity once again defeats those nasty aliens with our human ingenuity and determination.  A fun movie for everyone in the family to watch.ty one liners that seem to capture the moment in pithy humor.

6303347657|5.0|I think this movie is his best. It's got no sick parts like some of his other movies and it's great for kids. A loser puts on a mask and turns into a wacko superhero.
B00005RHGK|5.0|The sharper picture and the clearer sound makes this movie twice as scary.  I watched the alternate opening and ending sequences, and I can't believe Francis Ford Coppola told Mr. Salva to change them.  Same goes for the deleted scenes, it also might be good if they released a Jeepers Creepers that had NO changes, that followed everything in the ORIGINAL script, except for the part in the beginning when Darry thinks the license plate on the back of the first car they come across says \\"Gay-Fever, no Gay-Forever,\\" it would have been stupid for him to actually think it was meant to say 6A-4EVER.  Anyway, like many people know, the plot is the hideous, demonic, winged, ax-wielding Creeper (Jonathan Breck) is chasing two teenagers, Trish (Gina Philips) and Darry (Justin Long) around central Florida.  I was truly impressed at the Creeper's look, as well as the way he worked through the movie.  Justin Long and Gina Philips were great, and Victor Salva's excellent writing and directing should also be much credited.  I'm looking forward to Jeepers Creepers 2 as well!
078881172X|5.0|In my opinion, &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a dinsey masterpeice and one of the best classic Disney films. Wendy, John, and Michael all believe in the magic and wonder of Peter Pan, and one night as they are dreaming wendy is awoken by moving around in the nursey, there standing before them is &quot;Peter Pan&quot;who takes them to where he lives and where kids will never grow up into adults, Neverland. While discovering neverland they meet up with enchanting mermaids, indains. Wendy ,Micheal,John meets pans family sort of speak the lost boys and discover the wonder and childlike fantasies of never growing up. But most of all, they meet Peter Pan's biggest adversary,the mean and devilish Captain Hook.<br />I watched peter pan for the first time when i was five &quot;Peter Pan&quot; is a great classic film. When I was a kid, I used to watch it all the time and i still do, mainly because I used to wish that I would never grow up, just like Peter Pan and the lost boys. Now that I'm grown, I don't have those thoughts any more, but I still enjoy watching &quot;Peter Pan.&quot; It's a good movie. It's funny at times and exciting, it gives me a little bit of nostalgia everytime I watch it, and it even has unforgettable songs such as &quot;You Can Fly.&quot; I don't see where it matters how old you are, there's not anything wrong with watching cartoons after you're grown, If you like classic cartoon movies or if you have any children, This will absolutely hold their attention &quot;Peter Pan&quot; would be a great movie to own.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is the most surprising and uplifting film I have seen in years.  It is not only a charming farce of sorts, but wonderfully filmed and acted.
006092988X|4.0|It's wonderful that Betty Smith's classic &#34;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&#34; is still being read enthusiastically.<br />Betty Smith's character Francie Nolan is autobiographical. The detail with which Smith recreates life in a poor section of Brooklyn is memorable and meticulous: the small details such as  dinner after dinner of fried eggs with onions (eggs and onions being what the family could afford) are reminscent of &#34;Angela's Ashes.&#34;  Francie is spirited, bright and unquenchable and it's this spirit that has inspired young readers for decades.<br /><br />Smith was able to write autobiographically while fictionalizing the events sufficiently to create a novel. This is a marvelous writing. I enjoyed reading it again to study the skill with which Smith blended the ability to recreate her past in detail, yet keep the writing spare and fresh. This is great fiction.
6301930827|5.0|This movie is the best to show what WW III would have been like through the eyes of those who would have fought it. You get to see everything (almost): CINC-SAC in the Omaha bunker, The E-4 NEACP, Looking Glass-the airborne SAC command plane, and a B-52 from the 92nd Bomb Wing at Fairchild AFB to represent the bombers. The movie has a great cast, and it was nominated for several Emmys-IIRC James Earl Jones was nominated for Best Supporting Actor, and the movie was nominated for Best made-for TV movie. A few plot holes, though: Why not show an ICBM crew as well, or a USN missile submarine? How about some B-1s as well as the B-52s? Over all, a very good movie about World War III.
630587493X|5.0|Robin Williams again shows his technical acting talents as performs the un-human human android. He initially wears a full rubber costume that he even admits was the most uncomfortable thing to wear.<br />His entire performance for the first hour was emotionless, confused and robotic. His tone, although short and to-the-point - was often charming and funny.<br />Sam Neil's performance was wondrous and often respectful at the end of his life. Even the kids were funny and charming in this feature. The special effects also very noticeably advanced.<br />The DVD extras in this release are very cool. I would have wanted more behind the scenes, but oh well.<br />The book - a phenomenal piece of work - that this film is based on (Issac Asimov) - is honored by this film. It stays true to the characters. The DVD and the movie are very good. Read the book too!
0312265859|5.0|This latest entry in the Stephanie Plum series has all the trademark Evanovich touches:  great car scenes, recalcitrant fugitives, menacing bad guys, stun gun accidents, Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Grandma, and, of course, at least one new quirky character, in this case a lawyer named Kloughn.  The end of the book is somewhat flat and abrupt, but despite that the book is laugh-out-loud funny and a thoroughly enjoyable read.
630024797X|5.0|Paris,Texas is one of the best films of the 80's and it deservedly won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984. This is a film that takes it's time developing it's characters and is not concerned with delivering a intricate story line. Instead, the film concerns itself with exploring intricate emotions. It is a painful story about loss, alienation, and the need to reconcile with the past. Director Wim Wenders, Writer Sam Shepard,and Cinematographer Robby Muller all did splendid work with this film. The music by Ry Cooder is also excellent and perfect for the film. The acting is what stands out the most though. The performances in this film are some of the best I have ever seen and that is the biggest reason the film has such a powerful emotional impact. The film remains truthful and believable from start to finish. You wont find any sentimentality or sensationalism in this film. Paris,Texas is a film that is both hauntingly beautiful and achingly sad. It's a film that makes us question our collective ideals, particularly materialism, and makes a moving statement about the power of the family. It saddens me that this film isn't as appreciated as it should be. Paris,Texas is a perfect example of what films should be. I hope it emerges on DVD soon.
0780020685|5.0|What really stands out in this edition offered by Criterion is the excellent narration.  You can either watch movie on its own or you can choose to watch the film while learning about the history of cast and crew, set design, editing and camera techniques.  <br />It was a brilliant addition to an already phenomenal film.
0790729652|3.0|I Adore Tim Burton.  I also Adore Batman.  I highly anticipated this film when it was being made, however I was greatly disappointed.  While it isn't a bad movie, it is terrible Batman.<br />Batman isn't about gadgets and things.  Batman is about a man who turns himself into the ultimate crime-fighting machine, and that's something that just got lost in the live-action transition to the big screen.  If you want to see some really good Batman, try the unedited version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker.
0767840135|5.0|This is a wonderful DVD to add to your collection.  I saw Quidam live before I saw the DVD.  While the DVD is really great, it comes nowhere near the experience of seing it live.  I bought it as a momento of going to the show.  I also strongly suggest the soundtrack.  The talents of the performers with Cirque du Soleil are breathtaking!
0880389052|5.0|I had the extreme fortune to meet Mr. Salvatore when he came to my town to sign books at the local Copperfields. He said that the best book he had ever written was Mortalis, and his favorite book was Homeland. While I have not yet had time to read Mortalis, I have read most of the books about Homeland's main character--Drizzt Do'Urden--and this is by far the best of them all. Drizzt is a drow (an elf with black skin and white hair, whom are almost always evil) and is born with purple eyes, an unusual thing about the drow since they have infrared vision, so their eyes are almost always red. Drizzt lives with his family in the drow city of Menzoberranzan, where most of the book takes place. The book is all about how Drizzt is so different from his kin--he is compassionate, he is niave, he is kind, he is honorable. All of these are traits that are practically nonexistant in the drow world. Drizzt's mentor shares the same ideals, and it is he, Zaknafein, who teaches Drizzt how to wield twin scimitars until Drizzt is arguably the best figter in all of Menzoberranzan. But then Drizzt must decide--can he live in a world with no morals, no kindness, no compassion, no mercy. In a world where drow children of lesser houses (ranks) are slaughtered for the fun of it, down to the last drow baby. This is the first book in the Dark Elf Trilogy, and the best of the three, I think (though the others are all wonderful as well), and one of the most moving books I've ever read. Drizzt is a believeable character, and I would place this book on the same shelf as J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Robert Lewis Stevenson's Treasure Island, Beryel Markham's West With the Night, and all of the other classics. Truely one of the best books in circulation today. Fantasy lover or not, you will wish that the book is not done when the end comes! A must read for all who love good writing!
0446677450|1.0|I will not waste more space on this work except to say that the review by John Reed at [...] sums up everything I might have said.  Vague or false statements, espousing the view that the chief goal of education is the amassing of wealth, advocating possibly illegal practices such as insider trading, and contradictory statements sometimes on the same page all point to one conclusion: do not bother with this book or this man's views in any way, shape, or form.  There is very sound and intelligent real estate investment advice to be had.....elsewhere.
0385720920|4.0|Chuck Palahniuk's Choke is about the spiritual self-immolation and reclamation of one Victor Mancini, con artist and sexual addict.  Once again Palahniuk makes short work of invoking compassion for his lost boy viewpoint character by daring you to like him in spite of all the reasons not to.  And, if you're like me, you do.  You pull for Victor even when he's told you not to.  You pull for him through the most scatalogical, pornagraphic, manipulated and just plain sick moments of your reading life, and you feel either thrilled or sordid yourself as you are led through all the messed-up elements of his messed-up life.<br />Me, I felt sordid.  I wanted to put the book down after the third page, but the writing was too strong and the character too compelling.  I gave it four stars because of the writing power, but kind of wish I had never read it at all.  I think that, like Fight Club, it's going to be with me for a long time.
B000002UAU|3.0|I get really sick of everybody saying that this is a five star album and that it is so orginal.  But, if only all of you people would listen to The Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (which is the GREATEST album of all time) then you could see where Sgt. Pepper came from.  You comment on the orchestral arragements and how they are so genius.  Wrong!  If you listen to the &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; orchestral arragements, especially on &quot;Let's Go Away For A While&quot;, then you see that The Beatles were trying to match Pet Sounds.  Also, I read an interview with Paul McCartney about Pet Sounds and he even says that Sgt. Pepper misses the point.  So this album is not completely orginal, but more of a response to The Beach Boys genius on Pet Sounds.  So all of you giving this album five stars, go listen to Pet Sounds, then this and you'll see my point.
6305165912|5.0|As far as off-beat commedies go (or any genre of film for that matter), this movie is untouchable.  The only commedy I can think of that even comes close to this movie in wit and brilliant character development is Rushmore, and even that is a relatively distant second.  I have watched this film about a thousand times and I still find interesting and minute details that I have never noticed before.  Anytime you get stressed out or find yourself taking life a little too seriously just kick back with a White Russian and enjoy this film.
B000005HLV|4.0|I must admit, when I first bought this album, I thought it [was], REALLY REALLY bad, only because of the [worst] ocals I have ever heard. Even though I've grown to love this album, I still believe Atilla's vocals (especially on the first track) are the worst I've ever heard. I mean it takes NO talent whatsoever to grunt and sneer little high-pitched vocals (his line 'in the middle of transylvania' on the first track of this album totally ruins it's vibe). But oh well, the guitar and drum lines are great on this album. I ordered 'Deathcrush' earlier this week, and I'm hoping Dead's vocals are much better.<BR>The Band-<BR>Euronymous, guitars- Wow, this guy was truly a legend. Great, grim black metal riffs does he write. It's sad that Burzum's founding and only member (his name I cannot remember) killed him. I'd like to hear the full story of that. But anyways, Euronymous does very well on this album.<BR>Hellhammer, drums- This guy is one of the reasons that this album and Mayhem in general appeal to me so much. He is incredibly fast, rivaled only by few. Not only is Hellhammer fast, his drum accents are awesome (to really get to hear Hellhammer's awesomeness, check out 'Mediolanium Capta Est')<BR>Atilla, vocals- Again, this guy is the worst vocalist I have ever heard. Period. I mean he does have some decent vocal lines in some songs (I am SO glad that he does not use that annoying vocal thing that he does on the first track on all of the songs). If Maniac was on this record, I would have given this album a 5. Also, Atilla is much improved on the afformentioned live album. <br />Well, this is sort of a mixed-blessing (I don't know if the word 'blessing' fits this album) of a CD. If you're really into BM and don't mind horrible vocal patterns, you should definately give this a try. Otherwise, steer clear of this one.
B00004XONN|5.0|kid a is like listening to something completely different. i don't think any particular review would do it justice, but i'll try anyway.<BR>it starts off with a great beat, goes to strange electronics, melodic flow, back to good giutars and ends with a song that lulls you into a dream. this album is great in its diversity and comprehensiveness. <BR>i don't think it's for everyone though. sometimes listening to it once isn't enough either. the more you listen, the more the album grows on you. it's rooted deep into me now, anyway.
B00005QDW1|1.0|This is the biggest showcase of what money, fame, and glory can warp a band into something totally different (and in this case, HORRIBLE).<BR>   I mean I will admit, even though I didn't really like No Doubt before, I enjoyed a few of their songs (never bought any of their albums though) and I respected them for being individuals and playing something new in an age of processed bands. But now, the band has degenerated to minor keyboards lines and videos of nothing but Gwen Steffani. The band might as well change their name to Gwen Steffani, because that's who's getting all the attention and recognition for this 'music'. <BR>   This band went to the generally unheard-of genre of ska, to dance and RAP music?! How did this happen? <br />Oh well, another year, another good band commercialized. Too bad, really...
B000066AXE|5.0|This movie was one of the best ones I have seen in a long time.  Russell Crowe was the perfect person for this role and the story was wonderful.  I recommend this film to anyone who likes Russell Crowe and for anyne who just wants to watch a good movie.
B00003CXI1|4.0|Well this fast paced picture had lots of interesting special effects.  Definately one for the family.
B000068TSI|5.0|Finally a Viet Nam war movie that doesn't treat us like freaks. This is not an anti-war movie. It simply shows how it was from the infantryman's point of view. Any so called intellectual that tries to make it more, just doesn't get it. I saw it by myself the first time, the second time I took my twenty-seven year old son. He was shocked at what we went through. Buy it. Buy several copies.
B000066NW0|5.0|You know what's so great about Avril?<br />10. She's got the \\"Just right\\" mix of pop, punk, and rock.<BR>9. She writes her own lyrics.<BR>8. Girl rockin'a guitar! Hello? How sweet is that?<BR>7. She skates.<BR>6. She doesn't care what people think.<BR>5. Everyone can relate to her or her lyrics in some way or another. Take the track \\"My World\\" she sings about her town having a small population (like mine),she talks about it taking \\"five hours\\" to get her hair straight (like me again. <BR>4. Everybody has less than perfect relationships. Avril really hits it head on about how relationships don't always work out. <BR>3. Her single \\"Complicated\\" really gives \\"fakers\\" and \\"posers\\" a good smack in the face.<BR>2. She has nice looking band guys. He he. <BR>1. SHE IS NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!! <br />Avril Lavigne rocks! Buy this CD. You won't regret it.
B000065V1V|5.0|I cannot say that I am a fan of David Bowie. In fact the only song he did that I clearly remember was &quot;Let's Dance&quot; from an album of the same title released in 1983. The only reason I liked it was that it was, naturally, a dance piece that even my beat-deaf college friends danced to. <BR>Heathen, the new album by Bowie, is one of the best I compilation of pop/rock music I have listened to and loved.  My taste in pop/rock (not that strong anyway) strayed from the genre in the last few years to Electronic, Euro Dance, DJ Mixes and lately Downtempo. But this baby-boomer rocker, whom I thought could never release anything that will interest me, just won another fan with the latest album. <BR>The album consists of smooth blend of styles, but they remained distinctively Bowie with his aged but experienced voice, at times kept at midrange low, and the highs were not extended beyond his vocal range. <BR>The melancholic &quot;Slip Away&quot; with distinct piano works came out very well; and the mood continued in the melodious &quot;Everyone Says Hi.&quot; Only an impatient listener will miss the faint touch of &quot;drum and bass&quot; in &quot;5:15, The Angels Have Gone,&quot; and the track titled &quot;I've Been Waiting For You&quot; is pure rock. I recommend this album to any fan of great music not just to Bowie's fans.
0312265859|2.0|I was there when the librarian put the brand new, One For the Money out on the shelf in hardcover, snapped it up, devoured it and was hooked.  But here, I was disappointed too.  I wondered as I read it whether it is the last book in the series.  The introduction of the stupid lawyer and his idiotic incompetence  and the other woman bounty hunter show us how far Stephanie has come and how far she still is from having professional expertise.  But the end does not really set up the next book, instead, it's \\"Stick a fork in me, I'm done.\\"  I hope I'm wrong!  I must say though, that Ranger is hot (and gallant at the end), and I have always loved Morelli.
B000067DNC|5.0|All I have been wishing for is the 2nd Season Boxed set of Stargate SG-1.  This series is one of the best SCI-FI's series ever made.<br />The 2nd season is much better than the 1st.<br />Now I have to start waiting for the 3rd season to come on on DVD.  Hopefully it will come much quicker than the 2nd.
B000065U1N|4.0|I would have liked to have given this movie five stars but that has to be reserved for truely exceptional movies and this wasn't quite there. Having said that I think that Ridley Scott is an exceptional director and this is a fine movie.  The characters are a little underdeveloped but this is not a movie that is essentially about characters.  It is a movie about an event.  It is not a romantic swashbuckler like The Three Musketeers.  It is a piece of gritty realism about a real event and like real life in moments of high stress events can seem to flash by at a pace that defies our ability to think about them.  I saw the History Channel presentation of this incident shortly after seeing the movie and if anything the movie probably understated the confusion and chaos of that 24 hours.  It also did not overstate the violence.  Estimates of Sommali casualities are frightening.  This was the news like tha papers never tell it.  Worth seeing for that alone.
B000000WF0|5.0|Ok if you buy the CD it's probably because of Bittersweet, I know, that's why I bought it. But that song is really not reflective of the album as a whole. the Verve as a band were imploding even as this was recorded and the music here is so much more than just that song. The Verve were never quite comfortable as a group...probably a deadly mixture of too much talent ego and ambition. But the sheer raw abilities of the constantly bickering members mean that the music they made was both intense and emotionally searing, almost overwhelmingly stark. \\"Velvet Morning\\" \\"Come On\\" \\"Space and Time\\" push the listener into places dark and deep where there is only the brutal honesty of the music and the words.
0452282152|5.0|Tracy Chevalier's inspiration for writing this novel came in the form of a Dutch painting entitled &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring.&quot;  The painting, portraying a girl in a blue and yellow turban wearing a pearl earring, was painted by the famous Johannes Vermeer.  Chevalier's &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is a creative and imaginative look inside the life of Vermeer's subject, the girl with a peal earring - Griet.<br />At sixteen, Griet is sent off to work as a maid after her father has an accident and can no longer work in his trade.  Her tasks at her new master's home are to clean his studio while managing to make it look as if it had not been touched and help with the normal housework.  Her master, of course, is the painter Vermeer.  &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is an account of Griet's time in the Vermeer household - her problems with the children, her brush with the plague, and, finally, the growing friendship between herself and her master and the trouble it brings.<br />&quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is a wonderfully written piece of literature that captures the reader's imagination.  From the very first page, Chevalier had me hooked - I read the entire novel in one sitting!  An extraordinary  novel that manages to weave together fiction with fact, &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot; is a book to be read by all.
B000065U1N|4.0|Quite apart from most of the reviewers, i concentrated on experiencing the film from within the confines of the participants of the events in Somalia.  Other reviewers have faulted the film for not bringing &quot;more&quot; than this to the cinema for them.<br />The book encourages an understanding of the events from a third-person omniscient view.  It reads like a list of facts and occurrances.  The book was so successfull in it's accurate rendition, that sections are required reading for the various Departments of Defense War Colleges.  This underscores its public success in making recent historical events very accessible to the non-military reader as well.<br />Several reviews have complained about the lack of personalization in the characters of the film. i thought some of the attempts at representing the characters' personal lives in the film irrelevant. when viewed from the perspective of a special forces unit on the streets of Mogadishu, you may know about the new wife of a fellow green beret, but you are quite busy avoiding the RPG round you've spotted rushing toward your hum-v window!  the success or failure of this film should not be evauluated on wether the characters had &quot;depth&quot; or not; but rather on how it depicts the *actions*.  i appreciated the room it left, indeed, suggested for such questions as &quot;should we have been there at all?&quot;  which brings us to the next complaint several reviewers have mentioned:<br />The other half of negative reviews for this film have faulted it for lacking an examination of &quot;purpose&quot; in american military policy and actions, such as the Somali events coverred in the film.  Again, i found such diatribe as did exist in the cinematic version slightly intrusive.  From the view of a special forces unit on the ground, &quot;purpse&quot; is not a question.  you will fail if you concentrate on such matters.  to represent the matters in any other way in a film based on such a book would be an injustice.  <br />the audience can and should form it's own critique of justice, of policy, of &quot;bringing right by might&quot;.  as the film suggested, american forces originally deployed there to bring food to the hungry, and and make sure donations from NGO's were being deliverred to the intended needy parties.  <br />the awkward few personal and political injections in the film may have made less clear that the audiencec should be responsible for such thoughts; not the film makers.  indeed, everyone i have met with personal experience in the Somali aid attempt / conflict have agreed.  the matters are much more complex than those who have faulted the film for seem able to understand. and the soldiers operating there did not ethically evaluate thier purpose when being fired upon by thousands of heavilly armed civilian thugs.<br />So why expect the movie to help you make sense of the political and personal aspects of these events?  <br />i applaud that R.Scott represented the events as accurately as possible.<br />-p d b<br />Note:<br />R.Scott is Brittish, and his influence on the political matters should be understood with this knowledge.  he had neither pro- nor con- american axes to grind while making this film.  he *did* recieve department of defense aid in filming (the millions of dollars worth of helicopters, advisors, etc...) but that is to be balanced against how the military viewed the text of the original book:  a critique of the failures of our efforts in Somalia.  what's more, most of the &quot;special effects&quot; shots involved real helicopter flying, by helicopter pilots involved in Somaila.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|After seeing Montsers Inc. I wanted to buy that movie from the theatre! Pixar and Disney know how to develope an excellent story and have the animation to match. Having it done on ink and paper would have made this movie...\\"another cartoon movie.\\"<BR>Computer animation is the way ALL Disney movies should be done, but hey we all can't be spoiled. Definately recommend this to a friend or 10 who have kids who are scared of the dark. This is an excellent way to show them, that monster's in the closet are our friends.
1878424319|5.0|This is a wonderful book, and I think should be passed around in highschools to teach these principles at an early age. The beginning of the book wasn't very interesting (to me). If you can get past the first 15-10 pages, it's very, very good, and well worth the reading! I'm going to pass this book along to all my friends.
6305014140|5.0|I always had a soft side for wandering swordsmen in anime. Probably because I'm privileged to learn the very same martial art that has entertained all of us Ninja Scrollers. The artwork might seem to be in a dated style and quite simple compared to the CG infused eye candy found in Ghost In the Shell, etc. But that doesn't take anything away from the detail and the originality Yoshiaki Kawajiri has shown us in Ninja Scroll. What's timeless is the way he combined over the top action with surprising moments of earthiness recognizable to a trained martial artist who views this film. This is exemplified in the duel against Utsutsu Mujuro, where every masterful stroke was in accordance to the real art of ancient Japanese swordsmanship while at the same time manage to keep you on your seat with it's furious presentation.<br />However there is a minor detail I just have to mention. Seeing how the title of the film is Ninja Scroll, there's very little evidence that suggests that Jubei himself is a Ninja. I guess it would be fair to say he's a wave man, Ronin, seeing how he fights with the Katana and has an impeccable sense of honor as opposed to the Ninja who fights with the Ninja-To and has little honor. Just thought I mention that because I wouldn't want people to have a confused idea about the Japanese culture.

0345446798|5.0|This book really rocks! I am familiar with Trisha McConnell from her TV show, so I got the book as soon as I saw it. I've never read anything like it. The subtitle--&quot;Why we do what we do around dogs&quot; really sums up what the book is about. McConnell compares dogs to wolves, and humans to chimps, and uses that perspective to explain a LOT. <br />McConnell is a great writer, fun, and the stories she tells about her experiences with both dogs and humans are incredible--insightful and moving. Her understandings about the underlying science of human-animal relationships are also awesome.<br />As you can tell, I really love this book.
0312265859|5.0|Once again, Evanovich lives up to everything I've come to expect from the Stephanie Plum series.  I have waited for this book since I finished Seven Up last summmer, and it exceeded my expectations!!  Stephanie is at her finest!!  I found myself laughing aloud!!  The added touch of the obscene rabbit kept me so amused that I had little time to mourn Stephanie and Joe's confused relationship.  The character of Kloughn is a fantastic addition to the already zany cast of characters!!  Ranger is still mysterious and sexy.  Lula (aka Aunt Jemima) is hilarious as usual!!  I highly recommend this latest books.  Evanovich's avid fans will not be disappointed!!  Happy reading!!
B000002IGV|4.0|Well we seem to have a little Oxford boy here. He doesn't seem to see how much better Twisted Sister is from the [junk] they play today including the \\"nu-metal\\". And he's also ripping on our country none the less. So not only are you a spoiled little prep but you're a spoiled little terrorist. Do we really need people like this taking up space in our country ladies and gentlemen? I think not. If anyone knows this little prep personally, send him back to Afghanastan. As the great Steven Tyler says \\"Eat the rich\\". And by the way, as soon as you write an album that sells more than this one did then you can whine and complain. Till you strike fame, shut your mouth.
B00003CXXP|5.0|OK, it's not exactly Spielberg and it's not exactly Kubrick. So, it's Spielbrick or Kuberg.  That's OK.  If you came looking for Spielberg's happy ending or Kubric's hallucenogenic or dystopian ending, prepare to be disappointed.  But if you want a blend of the best of these two directors, a bittersweet and aching examination of love, its formation, its endurance and its consequences, you will love AI.<br />I love absolutely everything about this movie.  From the first, Spielberg treats technology as incidental, not forefront in the movie.  It's simply there, part of everyday life.  Sure, it's more advanced than we have today, but it's so firmly rooted that it doesn't intrude on the viewer like a normal SciFi movie.<br />The plot, true, is a variation of Pinnochio, but still, the upshot of the story is no so much that David wants to be a real boy so much as it is that he wants to be loved.  He loves, and doesn't understand why that love is not returned.  He thinks that by becoming a real boy, this will happen.<br />The music, the direction, the way the film falls neatly into five main parts, the lighting, the acting by Haley Joel Osmont, Jude Law and all the cast is pitch perfect.  The ending is so emotional, I defy you to not shed a tear.
B000002H6C|5.0|The only reason this album got 5 stars is cause they won't let me give it more. I'm 16 and own a lotta CD's from the 80's which surprises people. I hate new music. THIS my friends is a masterpiece. Riffs, lyrics, solos, drums...all perfection. Even those of you who think they're a bunch of jerks have to wanna get up and beat someone when you hear \\"The Shortest Straw\\" on full blast. The late and great Cliff Burton contributes one last tune entitled \\"To Live is to Die\\" and throws in a few words at the end of this instrumental genius creation. My personal favorites are \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" (great lyrics and riffs) and \\"Dyers Eve\\" (pure thrash ladies and gents).
0312265859|2.0|For readers new to this series, the earlier books are lively, funny stories of Stephanie Plum's(a New Jersy Bouny Hunter) misadventures in the Berg. Culminating with this book, more recent offerings fall short of the mark, with stale plots, cutsie writing and underdeveloped main characters. Her recent books generally follow the same pattern of too many pages of screwball antics of Stephanie Plum and various (somewhat interchangable) sidekicks, shallow interactions with Ranger(mysterious hero) or Morelli (potential soul mate)mainly involving sex (or not) and quick resolution of underlying menance in last 50 pages, with the so \\"unexpected\\" cliffhanger reflecting a trite \\"will she, wont she\\" relationship with both men.  At least in Hard Eight Stephanie makes some decision, although it took some 200 pages of \\"antics\\" to get to it, and she decided, changed her mind and got the bad guy in the remaining 60 (or so) pages.  The resolution of the main plot and Stephanie's personal relationships seem tacked on and rushed.<br />Die hard fans will of course read it. I can only say I wish I had waited for the paperback.
B00005JKHP|5.0|The people who say this movie is too slow just need to get an attention span. This is a great movie and can be enjoyed if people would actually like to see a good character movie. Everyone else should go see the The Scorpion King.
B00005JKCF|5.0|This movie was one of the best ones I have ever seen in my entire life. Its about Peter Parker who falls in love with a girl called Mary Jane Watson. He gets bitten by a spider and has the sensation of super powers. <br />My favorite seen,<br />My favorite seen was when he was wrestling Bone Saw and when He was doing spirals in the air dodging the hook like things that the goblin was throwing....<BR>Oh, that reminds me, the goblin looked a little fake, but other then that it was a great movie.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|This greatest hits volume of Phil Collins is &quot;Almost Perfect&quot;.  The reason I say almost, is because the cd leaves off a very important song that was essential to Collins 80's sucess.  Yes you guessed it, &quot;Don't Lose My Number&quot;.  This is one of Phil's great catchy 80's tunes from the late summer of 1985 which is when in my opinion, he was at his pinnacle of success.  You just don't leave that song off of the cd, and put on the song &quot;True Colors&quot; which was a far cry from the greatest version done in the winter of 87' by Cyndi Lauper.  Besides that, this cd is a winner and has most of Phil's best solo work.  My choice, buy this cd and also &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;.  It will give you the best of both worlds.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a movie like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"The War Zone\\" or \\"Psycho\\" that is relentlessly brilliant and very difficult to watch. It's a movie I can only watch about once a year.<br />Much has already been written about this movie in the media and several excellent reviews below. The story of how four people fall prey to various addiction is well told. Aronofsky doesn't hit us with the horror right away. He lets us get to know the characters and their dreams before letting their addictions shatter those dreams. The acting is top notch. Leto and Burstyn and (surpisingly) Wayans are excellent. Connelley has gotten a lot of attention for a Beautiful Mind but this is her best performance to date.<br />It's Aronofsky's film-making skill that makes this movie stand out. The relentless editing, creative camera angles and taut pace give the movie a look that's unforgettable.<br />As for the Director's cut vs. edited version. The original movie was unrated because the MPAA wanted to give it the kiss of death with NC-17 (a rating it deserves -- this is NOT a movie for kids even though it's probably the most effective anti-drug message out there). Aronofsky bravely stuck to his guns and sent it out unrated. Blockbuster and other chains refused to stock an unrated movie, so some small edits were made. You won't miss much with the edited version, but I'd buy the Director's Cut on principle. Aronofsky deserves to have his true vision seen.
0312265859|2.0|Whow not a Wow book!  I was looking forward to another fun and fantastic read from Janet Evonovich and was very disapointed in the results.  The same elements were here as with the other 7 books in the series, but the writing wasn't on par as before.  The story was told, but it never got off the ground and played itself out.  It read like it was a forced and fast write instead of the witty banter, insights and character developement we've come to expect.  I'm sure I'll still buy the 9th in the series, but without holding my breathe.
B000066NW0|5.0|So, you're in a store looking for a new cd and you pass by Avril Lavigne's cd. You stop to take a look. &quot;Is this the cd I want?&quot;, you ask your self. Well, if you're looking for a cd jam packed with high energy rock/alternative songs with some fun pop/rock melodies to get your dose of mucic goodness, then this the cd for you. <BR>    It features the hot new single &quot;Complicated&quot; along with the pure rocker/skater type songs, &quot;Losing Grip,&quot; &quot;Unwanted,&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi.&quot; Then you get your fun party type songs like &quot;Mobile,&quot; &quot;Anything But Ordinary,&quot; &quot;Things I'll Never Say,&quot; and &quot;My World&quot; among others. <BR>    This is the cd of the summer and the best in my collection. Go and pick it up if you want a good time.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This film is an outstanding fantasy adventure film for kids from about seven through fifteen.  After that, its appeal drops off dramatically.  Director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire) does a fine job of bringing the wildly popular children's series to the big screen.<br />Columbus had a difficult decision to make with the first film.  The introduction of Harry Potter requires a good deal of character and plot development, which isn't particularly interesting to those who aren't dedicated fans of the books.  Columbus chose to be true to the series and spent a lot of time doing background work that would be useful in later films (two more of which are already planned).  That encumbers this film a bit, weighing it down with details at the expense of plot pacing.  So, while this film is not as thrilling as it might have been, it sets the stage for more exciting sequels.<br />From a technical perspective the film is marvelous.  The visual effects in this film are often astounding, especially the Quidditch match.  The cinematography is rich and dramatic, both the outdoor shots and those shot on the sets.  Columbus entices excellent performances out of the young and inexperienced cast members, but also works well with the veterans.<br />The acting is fabulous.  Daniel Radcliffe is an excellent find as Harry.  He has a kind of nerdy coolness that is perfect for the part.  He comes across more as a regular kid trying to come to terms with special powers than a self important superhero type.  This is exactly the right balance.  Emma Watson, playing Hermione, is the consummate scene stealer and it is difficult to believe that this is her first feature film.  Watson packs a perky punch and has a wide array of facial expressions that often make dialogue completely superfluous.  Her self assurance and boldness provide the ideal contrast to Radcliffe's characterization of the timid and tentative Harry.<br />The adult actors also represent themselves admirably.  RichardHarris and Maggie Smith provide steadying influences as Headmaster Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall.  Harris is almost unidentifiable under the flowing beard and robes, but his distinctive voice is unmistakable.  Smith is suitably stern and kind, showing she has a soft spot for Harry, but maintaining the authoritarian demeanor required of her position.  But the show stealer among the older actors is clearly Robbie Coltrane as the overly loquacious Hagrid (\\"I shouldn't have said that.  I should NOT have said that.\\")  Coltrane makes Hagrid as lovable as he is bumbling; a kid in a grown-up's body that is clearly on the kids' side.<br />This is a delightful film for middle school kids, a segment that has fewer film choices than toddlers and teens.  I'd rate it a 9/10, shaving a point for excessive workup that slowed down the story a bit.  However, for Harry Potter fans, this is a perfect ten.
0312265859|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Hard Eight, the latest Stephanie Plum enstallment.  I thought it was a much better book than the last two. I especially appreciated that it did not end in a cliffhanger, which I have not at all enjoyed in the previous couple of books, and which I consider to be a cheap trick. The action was great, the humor fantastic, and the relationships between Steph and Ranger and Joe were developed to a greater degree than in previous books.  I couldn't quite give it 5 stars, due to one particular little scene, but if you have enjoyed the previous books in this series, this is well worth reading.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|As soon as I began to watch this movie I was enthralled. When it was over I was amazed and emotionally attached. By the time the credits were fading out I was still happily stunned. Donnie Darko made me think. Even two days after I had watched it the story seemed to be playing over and over again in my mind.<BR>Definitely a must-see for anyone who enjoys a very well put together suspense thriller or Sci-Fi. The plot is forever moving along with so many layers to it you wouldn't want to watch it just once! I can't wait to see where they might go next with it.<BR>Jake is incredible and gives a stunning performance alongside such a wonderful array of people.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A Beautiful Mind(winner of the 2001 Oscar for Best Picture) is an excellent movie in every way: acting, directing, cinematography, and the score. <BR>  A Beautiful Mind starts out with Russel Crowe as John Nash starting school at Princeton. He is struggling to invent an original idea in mathematics, because that is the only way that he ever sees himself mattering in his mind.<BR>  John succeeds, and five years later he is a professor at Princeton. There he meets a student, Alicia, that he falls in love with and marries.<BR>  At this point in the story, John's sickness progresses is diagnosed. Then things really get bad for Alicia and John.<BR>  Overall, A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful and perfect movie- in every way.
630575067X|2.0|This movie did NOT live up to the huge hype that was started by it.  Sure, it's Star Wars, and it sells.  But the quality of this movie doesn't deserve to be sold.  Overall, the acting was OK, with, in my opinion, the best acting being done by Ewan Mcgregor as Obi-Wan.  I'm not even going to start to criticize Jake Lloyd's performance as Anakin &quot;Annie&quot; Skywalker, because everybody has already criticized it enough.  I know that all of these actors are very good ones (I just saw Episode II, Natalie Portman was awesome in that movie, and has improved vastly from Episode 1, as was the Anakin Skywalker character played by Hayden Christensen, and Ewan Mcgregor has improved even more from his great performance in Episode 1).  The comedy that was attempted NEVER even started to be funny in the minds of adults or teens, as Jar Jar Binks wasn't funny at all.  The only good parts were the Darth Maul fight, since I am a fan of Lightsaber combat, and the Yoda parts, since I am a fan of Yoda.<br />I'm sorry to criticize so much, I've never liked critics who overly criticize things, because frankly, they couldn't do ANY better.  Neither could I.  But as a Star Wars fan, I was disappointed.  I'm glad Episode II passed up my expectations.  I was not the least bit disappointed with that one.
B00004SC3M|3.0|Dude, Sean Connery needs to stay retired. Seriously. You can't steal anymore. An insurance investigator and art thief played by Catherine Zeta-Jones (too hot to even by near the retired guy) is assigned to check out the retired burglar. They join forces after much bickering and do a good job. Then they go for a huge Y2K bank theft. This movie moved too slowly for me to even care about what was going on. Zeta-Jones would be a good Bond girl, but not for Connery. Blasphemy! Ultra funny Ving Rhames was also in this movie, but he made a couple of appearances. The ending left an opening for a sequel, but I hope they just leave this as it is. No more artifact, young woman movies!
6305165912|5.0|This is a really funny movie that will offer clarity and perspective in your life.
B00005JKNC|3.0|In the early `50s, a trip from Los Angeles to Bakersfield would take about eight hours; then they built the Interstate, and now you can make the same trip in two hours.  The experience of the journey is basically the same, as you're covering the same ground, only quicker.  The main difference is that once you reach your destination now, you can actually appreciate it more because you're not so worn out from the trip itself.  Interestingly enough, \\"The Majestic,\\" directed by Frank Darabont, is set in the early `50s, and uses the pre-Interstate route to take you to the final destination.  The thing is, had Darabont opted for the two hour route (which was available), he would have taken his audience to the same place and it would have been entirely more effective.  Especially since, once you finally arrive, you realize that you've been there before, anyway.  Even so, like visiting an historic landmark, it's worth a look.  But be prepared; the journey is long, and it may wear you down a bit.<br />Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a \\"B\\" movie Hollywood screenwriter, but he's working on a project now that just may take him to the \\"A\\" list.  This is his big chance, and he's going to make the most of it; this is the one that's going to take him to the top.  Right in the middle of it, however, there's a glitch-- and it's a big one:  The McCarthy hearings are in full swing, Peter's name has been given to the committee, and he's been called to testify.  And his movie-- along with his future-- has been put on hold.<br />Shocked and dismayed at having the rug pulled out from under him, Peter gets in his car that night and hits the highway, driving just to drive, to get away, letting the road take him where it may until the sun comes up or he runs out of gas, whichever comes first.  Neither of which happens, though, as fate intervenes; he has an accident, and when he comes to he's lying on a beach somewhere, with no idea who he is or why he's there.  But there's still some luck leftin the hand he's holding, and his name is Stan Keller (James Whitmore), who is out for his morning stroll when he finds Peter, befriends him and takes him into town.  And it's there that Peter's life really begins to change, when a man named Harry Trimble (Martin Landau) spots him and mistakes him for his son, Luke-- gone some nine years and thought lost at war.  For Harry-- and for the whole town-- it's like a miracle; as if they've all been given a second chance.  Because Luke-- thought gone forever-- has come back.<br />Darabont has crafted and delivered a film that initially (for the first forty-five minutes or so) is alive in a Bradburyesque way that is filled with hope and the stuff that dreams are made of.  It's the story of a man wronged who not only gets a second chance, but a chance at something seemingly better than what he had before.  Something cleaner, somehow; pure.  But once Darabont has established the magic, he enters a holding pattern.  Peter may not know who he is, but we do, and we know it's only a matter of time before his true identity is revealed.  In the meantime, the magic slowly begins to dissipate in the realization that Peter's story is really nothing more than a smoke-and-mirrors act, behind which lies the true purpose of Darabont's film.  What we begin to understand is that the Peter Appleton character is nothing more than a vehicle through which a statement can be made about McCarthyism and the injustice it wrought upon the lives of a number of innocent people.  <br />\\"The Majestic\\" then, is a cinematic hybrid; the offspring of a union between \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" and \\"Guilty by Suspicion.\\"  An interesting concept, to be sure, and fairly well executed by Darabont.  But you leave home for a specific destination, only to find you're elsewhere once you arrive.  And Darabont takes you there via the scenic route; better had he taken the alternate route, as there is nothing along his route that makes the beginning or the end any more significant, entertaining or noteworthy in any way.  <br />The saving grace of the project is Jim Carry, who leaves his rubber face behind this time and gives a performance that is truly \\"majestic.\\"  The most significant aspect of this film, in fact, is that it demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor Carrey is.  His portrayal of Peter Appleton is quite natural and unaffected, he exhibits an unusual (for him) amount of restraint while using an introspective approach to the character, and there is a decided lack of pretentiousness in his presentation that makes him entirely real and convincing.  It's a performance that should prove to his detractors, once and for all, that there is more to Jim Carrey than \\"Ace Ventura\\" or \\"Lloyd Christmas.\\" <br />As the man who gets the ball rolling by mistaking Peter for his own son, Martin Landau gives an affecting performance, although he could've taken a cue from Carrey in the restraint department, as he tends a bit too much toward melodrama at times.  Still, it's an engaging portrayal and does, indeed, effect the desired results.<br />The supporting cast includes Laurie Holden (Adele), Allen Garfield (Leo), Amanda Detmer (Sandra), Bob Balaban (Elvin Clyde), Brent Briscoe (Sheriff Coleman), Jeffrey DeMunn (Ernie), Hal Holbrook (Congressman Doyle), Ron Rifkin (Kevin), David Ogden Stiers (Doc Stanton) and Karl Bury (Bob).  \\"The Majestic\\" then, is something of a mixed bag; it's an engaging film, but Darabont allows the emotional involvement to waver somewhat during the journey, before successfully reestablishing it at the end.  And the outer shell masks the fact that there's also a nut inside, along with the milk chocolate.  In the final analysis, however, it's still the magic that is the movies.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|Pauls Album Quickies:<BR>Michael Jackson has done so much in his 30 year career, but his greatest acheivement is the 1982 release of THRILLER. He created an entire new genre of music that has been imitated from then on, but not outdone as of this writing. This album shows us what pop music should be and how to make it like it is meant to be made. From the first track to the last, THRILLER delivers an incredible amount of emotion and danceable tunes that never get old, as many songs do. In short, it is the BEST and greatest album ever created and shows the amazing things you can do with music.
B000060P79|1.0|Seriously, this is even worse than new found glory.  honestly, there isnt even the slightest hint of punk in this.  anyone who calls this punk or pop punk obviously has never heard stuff like rancid or bad religion or operation ivy.  if you like all those crappy pop bands like new foung glory and blink 182, then this is right up your alley.  im just glad i didnt waste my 14 bucks on this.
B000065U1N|3.0|While I was watching Black Hawk Down, I had a considerable amount of trouble focusing on the plot (was there one?) because I could never tell who was who.  Even when I watched the closing credits, some of the names of the characters I didn't even recognize.  Although it had a lot of great action, that was all there was.  So if you want to see two hours of gunfire, fighting, and blood, this is the movie for you, but don't expect a great story, or any story at all for that matter.
B000009EAD|5.0|after reading some of the reviews written by my brother and sister metal heads ( True metalheads at that ) I couldn't help but be a little dismayed at the fact that while in Europe and Greece  Iced Earth is HUGE......

I say it's time for a little shakedown and get Iced Earth touring in the USA like they should have been in the first place ..... sorry I'm ranting .... and now my review  HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!! this is the cd that got me hooked on IE and the song that started it all ..

B00006878K|5.0|If you are reading this review, I'll have to assume you are new to blues and blues guitar in particular.  If you weren't, you wouldn't need any convincing by me to pick this classic up right away.  BB King may be called the King of the Blues, but Albert King is the player most wished they could sound like.  He was Stevie Ray Vaughan's favorite player and the only man Hendrix said he was afraid to share a stage with.  Live Wire, Blues Power may feature flashier long extended guitar solos, but this cd, more then any other, is the one I use to answer the question: who is Albert King?  I just pop it in the deck and let the opening title track fill the room.  Two or three tracks are usually all I need to get any newbie running out for their own copy.  With guys like Booker T., Steve Cropper, Donald &quot;Duck&quot; Dunn, and the great Issac Hayes backing Albert up, this thing grooves from begining to end and every track is a gem.  This could quite possibly be the single greatest and most important blues album ever recorded.  It's so nice to see it available again.  Do yourself a favor and make this your next blues guitar cd.  While you're at it, pick up Live Wire, Blues Power and I'll Play the Blues for You.  You may have just found a new favorite guitar player.
B00005JKED|1.0|THE worst!  Washington and Hawke exchange badly scripted rants in performances no better than those found in really wretched community theatre.  Fuqua's uninspired directing turns this movie into a typical made-for-ghetto blaster.  The corrupt-cop genre has been done better MANY times before.  As for Oscar, God in not great, D.  In this case, God is overly generous.
B00005221M|5.0|Last of the Mohicans is a beautiful movie. Although graphic at times the story is a timeless one. The cinematography is beautiful. The actors are wonderful and so is the score. This movie is one of my favorites and I think anyone who likes sweeping adventures will love it as well.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was very, very pleasantly surprised by Norah Jones' first effort.  The biggest complaint I have with respect to Jazz vocalists is that they often discard melody in favor of virtuosismo (read: it's just to show off their voices).  Such is not the case here; all the tracks are beautifully arranged, and provide a melodious presence that translates into distinctive experiences.  If you like Dido, Diana Krall, Sarah Brightman, you will probably love this disc.
0142000655|5.0|One of the most familiar stories from the Old Testament is that<BR>of Cain and Abel. Because God was more pleased with Abel's gift,<BR>Cain murdered his brother and was exiled for the rest of his<BR>life.<br />Cain may have been the first murderer, but unfortunately he was<BR>not the last. His question, \\"Am I my brother's keeper\\" is as<BR>crucial today as it was then. This crime is famous precisely<BR>because it is so universal.<br />It is no wonder that novelists have used this story in their own work. One of the most famous of these modern parables is \\"East of<BR>Eden\\" by John Steinbeck. In fact, he uses the story at least two<BR>times.<br />The first part of the novel focuses on two brothers, Charles and<BR>Adam Trask. As young boys their conflict began when their father<BR>shows favoritism for Adam and continues throughout their adult<BR>life, culminating on Adam's wedding night when Charles gets him<BR>drunk and sleeps with his new wife.<br />Nine months later Cathy's children (Steinbeck never tells us who<br />the father is) are born. Their very names, Cal and Aaron, tells<BR>us quickly that the Cain and Abel story is going to be continued<BR>in the new generation, and sure enough, it is. Adam, like his<BR>father before him, accepts a gift that Aaron gives him and<BR>rejects Cal's offering. <br />The result is tragedy, and the search for redemption begins<BR>again. When Cal asks if he can overcome the evil he finds within<BR>him, he realizes that the answer is that he may, showing that he<BR>has the power to choose good or evil for himself, a choice that<BR>makes him great.<br />But the power of this book lies not just within the story itself;<BR>the characters Steinbeck draws for us are among the most vivid in<BR>modern literature. In addition to the two sets of brothers is<BR>Cathy, one of the most corrupt women I have ever encountered.<BR>From the time she burns her own parents alive to the way she<BR>manipulates all of the men she encounters, she finds delight in<BR>evil.<br />Balanced against her is Samuel Hamilton, a good man who finds<BR>happiness in the land on which he lives and his many inventions.<BR>When he first meets the Trasks, Adam is devastated because Cathy<BR>has deserted her family to become a prostitute in nearby Salinas.<BR>Sam helps him to recover.<br />But my favorite character is Lee, the Chinese sage who plays the<BR>role of the typical subservient Chinaman, but who in private<BR>guides Adam and his boys. It is Lee who reveals the meaning of<BR>the Old Testament verb timshel as \\"thou mayest,\\" giving the gift<BR>of freedom to Cain and to us today. And it is Lee who must, at<BR>the end, try to keep this family from destroying itself<BR>completely.<br />Steinbeck is a powerful writer, and this is one of his most<BR>powerful novels. I envy you if this is your first time reading<BR>it.
B00005QIPH|1.0|This is a New York band? I thought New York had edge.  Come on guys, get out there and live a little.  What are you, holed up in some foofoo penthouse living it up or something?  Girls and parties?  Go to Harlem, go to the meat packing district - go somewhere and find yourselves some inspiration.  God - is this CD bland or what?<br />I live in New York and there are a lot of new bands with a point of view.  There are a lot of bands trying to DO SOMETHING NEW.  Not these bums.  And some of those bands went to prep schools that are even hoity-toitier than the ones these jokers went to, so that ain't the reason.  There's one decent song here and all I can say about it is that its fun.  Jiminy Chrikit, if I want fun I'll listen to some pederast LA ska band!!<br />If I wasn't going to return this CD I'd throw eggs at it!
B00005BJPO|5.0|I can't say any more about the movie, since everything good has been said about it.  Yes, there are a few nitpicks, such as a lack of chracterization and the disturbing &quot;stadium&quot; scene, but nobody can argue its influence on animation today. I'm simply here to write about the DVD.<br />The movie features the original Japanese language with opitional subtitles and a new dub done by Animaze.  Although some purists of the original  dub may cry foul, it was out of Pioneer's hands, as they could not get access to the original dub.  Acting in both languages is great - and the THX quality of the new English dub will bring down your house.<br />The anamorphic transfer is great, as the colors are brighter than before, although one may complain about edge enhancement.  Most probably won't mind it though.<br />The first disc also features a capsule option that gives the viewer more information while watching the movie.<br />The second disc is home to a myriad of extras.  It will take one HOURS just to sift through everything included on the second disc.<br />The Limited Edition Tin box packaging puts the finishing touches on a solid movie.  Must own for any anime fan or DVD fan.

B00005Q66N|5.0|Everybody knows that this is a great record so i won't go on and on about the songs etc.<BR>The main reason to get this import is that the version of China White is different. China White is one the great heavy songs by the Scorpions. When Blackout was originally released Rudolf could not decide between 2 solos for the song so put one on the US release and one on the European release. I have been waiting for this re-issue so that I could finally replace my german LP with a CD. By the way the CD sounds great and there are some cool pictures etc. in the booklet. THIS THE SCORPIONS AT THEIR PEAK.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This is a great cd! I recommend anyone to buy it and the type of music britney is doing hs definitely evolved from her debut album. One of my personal favorites is LONELY, it has a cool beat and a lot of attitude to it, as does the majority of her other songs. WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME is also awesome. I just really wish she would apply herself more, she has a lot of talent hidden somewhere as she displayed in her childhood. I am not a pop fan but this album is definitely an exception!
B00003CWN3|5.0|i've pretty much stopped writing reviews, but this movie drew me back into the ring.  i usually have a strong point of view with things i read or watch, and can critique them comfortably, but not with this one.  all i know is that i felt disturbed, and slept horribly, after watching it.  i think it kicked up some real deep stuff in me.  but i still give it five stars, because its quality shined through.<br />incidentally, i almost stopped watching it entirely a couple of times during the film.  this was a film that like FEW others i could call TRULY DEPRESSING.  the crux of what made it feel depressing for me was that it was about a human being who was so STUCK in their life.  there felt like so few options for brandon, like his/her only choice was to live a lie.  it's like he/she so wanted to be something he/she wasn't that she/he just had to pile on lie after lie.  that's what killed me.  it was a story about a person who just SIMPLY DID NOT FIT IN OUR SOCIETY.  that's i guess what this film was about.  it was a major criticism about our society - a society that just accepts people who fit into narrow little windows of sex, sexual orientation - and certainly gender.  god, if i can't even comfortably choose a pronoun (he/she) for brandon, how would it feel to BE brandon...or teena?<br />i really do think brandon was neither a man nor a woman, a boy nor a girl.  he/she was a person somewhere in the middle, and because of our society's small-minded ways brandon just did the best he/she could...and picked a team and started playing.  she felt more like a man and tried going that way.  i myself am a therapist, and wondered how i would have dealt with a patient like brandon.  suggested a sex-change?  suggested more self-acceptance?  suggested anything?  cried?<br />one other thing that got me, and that i found painful, was that brandon's problems were not just about gender - and his/her gay friend summed it up nicely about the consequences of his/her destructive criminal/lying/irresponsible tendencies, from what i remember.  \\"brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.\\"  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.<br />so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.<br />got bless brandon...i wish you'd had better luck.l/lying/irresponsible tendencies, from what i remember.  \\"brandon, you're either gonna end up in jail for a long time...or dead.\\"  the moment when the carpet got pulled out from under me emotionally in the film was when brandon was in court waiting to face sentencing for car theft...and he/she turned around and walked out.  it was like placing the kiss of death on herself.<br />so, i know this is a rambling review.  i hope it's helped someone somewhat, and i know it's helped me to write it.  i just found this film so disturbing, and it just shines the light for me on the fact that we live in a world that makes it VERY VERY hard for some people to live a happy, well-adjusted life.  i guess in our own ways it's hard for all of us.<br />got bless brandon...i wish you'd had better luck.
B00005JKT8|5.0|This film was wonderful!  I realise that the plot is certainly far-fetched and altogether not feasible, but it is also very entertaining.<BR>     Hugh Jackman puts in an excellent performance as a 19th Century duke, trapped in modern New York because of a fluke in time travel, courtesie of Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), amateur scientist and great-great-grandson to Leopold.  Mr. Jackman and Meg Ryan play off one another very well, not to mention the lovable, childish antics of Kate's (Ms. Ryan) brother, Charlie (Breckin Meyer).  (Be sure to catch Mr. Meyer's imitation of an Indian watching a Mets game for the first time.  Good golly!) Bradley Whitford portrays Kate's boss, the greasy dirty not-so-old man, with alarming skill.<BR>     My complaints are few.  There is little cursing, which is good, and no sex, which is even better.  Ms. Ryan's hair resembles that of a wet dog, but that can be looked over and detracts little or nothing from the plot.<BR>     All in all, this is a charming film, one that I have seen more than once, and will see again.<br />Overall review:  Lovely!!
B00003CXTG|5.0|Since the tragic Dec. 7. 1941 morning, the event has needed a movie to do it justice, this one has. The battle scenes were quite good and Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale did an excellent job promoting the emotional side of the film. I think this nmovie is a must see event for all who feel any emotion to the fatal December day.
B000066NW0|5.0|Solid album.  Lyrically, probably one of the most sound albums on the market, especially from the new teenage pop stars.  Lyrics sparked from the teen poets -- heartfelt, simple, and honest; with more depth the more you listen.<br />Musically well performed.  Vocals that ring true to the female Canadian vocalist tradition of the late 20th Century.  Powerful voice, backed by a strong, heavy, layered musical staging.  <br />Absolutely a great album to buy.  <br />A wellspring of talent, waiting to grow.
0312265859|5.0|After being ever so slightly disappointed with Seven Up, Evanovich comes back better than ever with Hard Eight. Although there are slightly darker undertones to the burg in this book, there are also many wonderful laugh out loud moments.  While tracking down a child for her parent's neighbor, Stephanie manages to aquire another wanna be bounty hunter apprentice to \\"help\\" out, adding to a real three way circus effect to her apprentions. She also manages to tick off some of the real bad guys in the burg and needs more help from Ranger who calls in his \\"favors\\" in this book, FINALLY! Now Stephanie really has a dilema as Joe and Ranger both try to look out for her in their own ways.  Best of all we see that maybe the apple didn't fall too far from the tree as Stephanie's mother shows what she is really made of, and it isn't pot roast!  Great Read!
0345451325|5.0|This book is great. I read it in two days. It really makes the game make more sense, and you learn more about the main character. This book is a must read for people who havent even played the game.
B00005N83M|5.0|I love Jennifer Lopez and this album just shows how talented she is. She can sing anything...latin, pop and r&b....to all of those who cherish artists with this talent....BUY THIS CD!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|First things first: this CD is incredible.<br />Garbled, mysterious, intense, overwhelming, maybe.  Brilliant? Definitely.  I only wish I could get inside Thom's brain as he was creating this album, to truly visualize what he and his band were trying to accomplish.  I cannot give Radiohead enough respect for making an album to satisfy themselves, not their OK Computer happy executives or fans who can't spend a moment to think about what they are experiencing.  This album is seamless from start to finish, its layers and textures are perfect.  I think Thom was attempting to use his voice as an actual musical instrument , hence all the blips and garbled messages throughout.  If Radiohead intended for the listeners to comprehend the lyrics, they would have made it easier, but they didn't want you to listen to this like an ordinary album.  It is an extrordinary album and should be treated as such.  Yes, it's difficult.  But if you truly give this album a chance, maybe experience it in a different time or atmosphere, it can provide the listener with more emotions and themes than OK Computer ever could.  Like the first track says, everything is in its right place; you just have to search below the surface.  Don't give up on Radiohead just because they evolved, the same thing happened when Tool released the subtler Lateralus, which was just as if not more brilliant and introspective into the human condition.  If this review doesn't make sense, I'm sorry, it's 2:00 AM.  Just give the album a chance.  There's so much substance locked beneath the complexity.
0767903854|5.0|I loved this book!  Like many Americans, I've never been to Australia, but would like to visit.  This book is a lively tour of all the places an American visitor probably wouldn't venture on a one or two week vacation of Australia.  <br />Best of all, Bryson is an honest and witty writer, making his books easy and pleasurable to read.
B00005QIPH|1.0|no instrumental skill. no lyrical skill. no vocal skill. not exciting. not vital. not good! worthless. a waste of fifteen bucks and a shipping charge, not to mention the paper the inserts were made out of or the plastic the cd was crafted from or the technology used to burn the data onto the disc. if you really like music, do yourself a favor and buy &quot;The Three EP's&quot; by the Beta Band instead.
0802130208|5.0|We have seen the character of Ignatius J. Reilly before haven't we? Is he Don Quixote wandering the plains of Spain with Sancho Panza tagging along like the Cockatoo that pulls rings from a stripper's suit? Is he Huck Finn navigating the gothic waters of a South filled with disparate quirky characters and a whole host of preconceptions, misconceptions, and derelictions? Ignatius is all of these and more. The real genius of Toole's sprawling tragi-comedy \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\" is the uniqueness of the main character and the cast of dunces at the fringes, the fringes of the tale and the fringes of society.<br />When people talk of this novel, they talk of its humor. I didn't find it rolling on the floor funny, like I have with books like \\"Catch-22\\", or parts of some of Don DeLillo's novels. But I did find several scenes so uncommonly placed together with an imaginative patchwork of human freakish delights that it couldn't help but place a tattoo on your brain. That's a little deeper than laughing sometimes. There's the \\"Night of Joy\\" bar where Jones rearranges the dust on the floor and the proprietress takes charitable donations for an orphanage (illicit racy picture ring in reality). There are the misguided political rallies that I.J. Reilly heads up at Levy pants and another for a drag queen party that turn out to be not more than Quixote swashbuckling a wooden sword at spinning windmill blades. The beauty is that people take part for the entertainment, for the diversion from boredom, for the fact of being human and reveling in Reilly's misguided idealism for kicks and grins.<br />To cap off the novel, for the ending there is an escape (not to give it away with details) with a little future hope thrown on top of all the mired downtrodden tragi-comedy we've come to know and love as Reilly journeys along searching for the right words to scrawl across the myriad of Big Chief tablets strewn across his medieval cave of a room. To give the author credit it becomes a suspenseful escape, one that we as readers care about and leaves us with some hopes. What more could you want in a novel? So from Myrna Minx, Miss Trixie, and Paradise Dogs, read on brothers and sisters, WHOA!!uspenseful escape, one that we as readers care about and leaves us with some hopes.

B00003CWL6|1.0|This movie is way to over rated and way to digusting:there's nothing enjoyable about an old man having sexual fantasies about his daughers best friend or about a gay neigbour abusing his son.  This movie may have a good one had they altered the story line a bit and done some good directing and of course properly ended the movie.  if your looking for drama filled with betrayal and evilness look no furhter to cruel intentions a movie that ended the right way.
0553801481|5.0|A Fool's errand\\", sequel to The Farseer\\" triology, starts where Robin Hobb's last book about Fitz, Chade, and Ketrricken had ended.  Again, one becomes part of FitzChivalry Farseer's inner fight to make sense of life. He was deeply hurt in his childhood and is drawn into the constant quarrel of  having to decide between his anxiety to trust others and his duty to protect the Farseer line.  As the plot procedes, Fitz realizes that by shutting his feelings away and by living apart from the ones he loves, there is no way for him to really work his feelings out.  When Fitz is once more asked for help by his mentor, Chade, he does not face a dangerous adventure alone but is confronted with his innermost fears and worrys.<br />Robin Hobb is an extraordinary writer because of her ability to make one part of the protagonist's feelings, which in difference to other fantasy stories are dominated by fears to fail and his knowledge of how easy it is to hurt one another.  The writer shows the only way to deal with such feelings: do not hide and retreat, but take a step forward, even if it is a little one, and face your life.  That is the reason the book and the entire series means so much to me.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I just finished listening to the CD for the first time and I am totally impressed. The vocals, the fact that he wrote every song, both words and music is totally impressive. Its smooth, smart lyrics totally have me hooked. Oh, and yes, I hear the similarities to the DMB, but SO WHAT? There's lots out there that sounds like others but that doesn't take away from its own value. This is a great CD and I can't wait for the next!
B0000024SI|5.0|For me, the song &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; stands out the most because it is able to keep asking the question, &quot;Do you, Mr. Jones?&quot; over and over without getting to be too much like the Jones's.  The sixth verse, about the &quot;one-eyed midget,&quot; has a perfect summary of the theme of the whole song.  &quot;And you say what does this mean? And he screams back you're a cow Give me some milk Or else go home.&quot;  I'm sure a lot of people spend a lot of time thinking about this.  I certainly do.
6302054982|5.0|There's only one word to describe this movie: MASTERPIECE!!<BR>This movie is unbelievable in all its glitzy and gritty deliciousness. It stars Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Paul Sorvino, and Lorraine Bracco. Ray Liotta is the film's central figure as his narrative lets the audience in on the mafia life he had lived for nearly 30 years. <BR>Robert De Niro plays veteran gangster Jimmy Conway. Although it is in some instances, a more 'quiet' role, De Niro delivers a characteristcally electrifying perfomanance. He's captivating. But for hard-core De Niro fans like myself, we expect nothing less from the master. <BR>Joe Pesci's role as trigger happy gangster Tommy DeVito is awesome. He provides the black comedy that is present in the film as well as the extra boost of energy and star power.He's a mean force to reckon with. Pesci's Oscar for his work in this film was well-deserved. If he didn't win, they would have to answer this movie kingpin! :) <BR>Paul Sorvino plays the kingpin Paulie whom Henry views as his adopted father. His performance is highly commendable. He has a quiet furiousity in his role.<BR>Lorraine Bracco gives a 'pre-Sopranos' performance as Henry Hill's bedazzled wife, Karen. Her peformance is awesome and it definitely serves the movie well.She holds the intrigue that many feel when it comes to gangsters, so she's relatable.<BR>All in all, folks, Scorsese, with his wonderful steadycam shots, soundtrack,beautifully realized characters, and overall flawless cinematography, has created a powerhouse film that's on AFI's top 100 Films of All Time list and a film that isn't easy, if at all, to forget. <BR>Scorsese, you're a genius! Thank the Movie Gods for you!
B000063S6Z|4.0|In this CD, you'll find a departure from the techno-style multi track songs featured in &quot;Play.&quot;  Strings are the prevalent  instrument  throughout this album, coupled with some simple, yet effective, rhythms.<br />Moby's last album, &quot;Play,&quot; was also heavy on strings, but the songs had considerable more groove, thanks to their extra techno tracks.  The first time through, &quot;18&quot; sounds like a simplified version of &quot;Play.&quot;<br />But part of this is because Moby has discovered what makes his songs what they are.  That &quot;smooth&quot; electronic texture that Moby is known for is at its finest in &quot;18,&quot; probably because he has refrained from adding tracks unless absolutely necessary.<br />That's not to say Moby has gotten lazy.  The songs in &quot;18&quot; still do have quite a bit of electronic manipulation, including some very subtle effects that can affect your listening experience without you even noticing them.<br />Consequently, you won't find as many &quot;Body Rockin&quot; songs in this album.  Moby has taken time off from his techno heritage to pay attention to the fine details.
0783225792|5.0|Casino is dubbed a wonderful movie because of its wonderful direction, cinematography, and most importantly, wonderful acting. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, two familiar players in Scorsese's films, deliver unsurprisingly powerhouse performances. However, one should never ignore Sharon Stone's presence as De Niro's call girl wife, Ginger. She gives the performance of her career, in my opinion.They're all electrifying!<BR>I loved the fluid camera movements as it helped capture the mood and 'kick back city' feel of Las Vegas. The soundtrack is awesome as it ranges from classical, to classical rock, soul, and even Italian.I've always loved the way Scorsese intricately weaves music of a certain period all throughout the film. It's fantastic. I recommend buying the soundtrack,too.<BR>So..to make a long story short. This movie, like all other Scorsese movies, have the ingredients that make up a movie worth watching over and over again. Even if you've never seen a Scorsese movie, I encourage those who are curious to give in to curiousity.
0792843835|5.0|This is one of the sweetest flicks I've ever seen, and I tend toward the swashbuckling, &quot;guy flicks&quot;.  <BR>I think that what has grabbed me most with this movie is its surreal, yet believable premise; there IS a feeling of MAGIC throughout.<br />The evolution of true friendship between Brenda and Jasmine is as genuine as that between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin in Patrick O'Brian's novels. Their friendship is tense, tested and true.<br />Also, the music is haunting and most fitting to the movie.
6304884419|5.0|I loved this movie! I applauded De Niro's acting and directing for this film. It's an intriguing Bronx Tale with a young man at its center. It tells the story of Calogero, an Italian boy who grew up in a neighborhood that was run by a local hood named Sonny (Palminteri). Cologero admires Sonny's life of getting things easily like money, respect, and even fear. However his father Lorenzo(De Niro, who's a blue-collar bus-driver, tries to get Cologero to turn his back on Sonny for the sake of his life as well as everything that Lorenzo has instilled in his son. All in all, it's a wonderful movie. It's a story of love, loyalty, friendship and family amidst its violence.<BR>The music's awesome too!! Get the soundtrack.<BR>I recommend this movie to De Niro fans (like me!) and fans of the genre in general. <BR>Oh..and watch for a cameo by none other than Joe Pesci!
B0000062GE|4.0|I was first given this to listen to by a friend of mine (a cellist and college professor) who thought I would enjoy it (I gave him Nothingface-Violence).  We both wound up buying a copy of the CD we loaned each other for ourselves.<br />I can honestly say there isn't a single weak track on the entire CD.  If the lyrics don't grab me, there is something happening instrumentally that does--a groove, a guitar lick, some new beat, a motif in the keyboard, or some kind of cool ambient trick.  I don't think people should get into the habit of comparing this band to others in the sense of who is better or worse.  Bands, like composers, take and borrow from each other and influence each other all of the time.  As I listen to this CD I hear some NIN influence, I hear some Skinny Puppy influence, I hear some Electronica influence, some Ambient influence, all put together in their own original way.  I think it is safe to say that nobody sounds like Stabbing Westward, and they have successfully integrated all of those different genres into something extremely interesting.  I own a lot of NIN and Skinny Puppy, and so far I come back to listen to Stabbing Westward far more often.<br />If there is any drawback to the album (and really the only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 stars) it's that the album is extremely and consistently DARK.  Every song has misery and pain dripping from it lyrically, even if the instrumental part of it is busy and uptempo.  Thankfully I'm at an age now where this doesn't affect me terribly, but I imagine it would be perfect for that late-teen, early college year angst.

6303212379|5.0|Great kid's movie and super fun for adult viewers.  The Goonies are a band of kids not unlike the summer clubs we used to form in my neighborhood. Their summertime adventure begins with one of the members' home being threatened, and it doesn't end until they find the treasure that permits the kid's father to do what is necessary to save his house.  It's the in between part, the real story, you'll want to watch over and over again.  \\"Real life\\" beasties, fantastic adventure: This movie goes a long way to satisfy the explorer in each of us.  A must own.

B00001ZULV|4.0|When you listen to this album it's hard to believe that Genesis were once the kingpins of Prog Rock. All changed when Peter Gabriel left the group and the main driving force behind the groups new sound was to be drummer Phil Collins. I suppose with the advent of punk rock, prog rock had reached end game and the group needed to a new sound if they weren't to go the way of Yes,etc. This album is a collection of first class M.O.R. tracks that may sound a bit sugary and twee but I find it hard to truly dislike the tracks.<br /> It's very hard at times to differentiate between  the music of Collins solo career and the music of late 70's and 80's Genesis. The only slight difference would be that with songs like &quot;Mama&quot; has a distinctly darker more industrial sound, while songs like &quot;Abacab&quot; have a harder rock sound then Collins solo work. The first major foretaste that the music of Genesis had evolved into something quite different came along with &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; which is taken from the 'And Then There Were Three' album. It must have been an immense shock for Genesis fans at the time for the band to release a single and even more so a love song single! Still though it's a really beautiful song, truly enhanced by Tony Bank's keyboard arrangement. Each subsequent Genesis album seemed to include a couple of banker hit singles with tracks like &quot;Turn It On Again&quot; in 1980, &quot;Abacab&quot; from '81 and on to &quot;That's All&quot; in '83. By the time 'Invisible Touch' came along Genesis musically and lyrically ceased to be interesting of different. Even more startling was the disillusioned lyrics of tracks like &quot;Land Of Confusion&quot; which seems to be highly critical of the right wing politics of the Reagan, Thatcher era. It was all a bit gaulling, especially when as it was sung by Collins, who was a self-professed supporter of Thatcher's policies. Still though tracks like &quot;Invisible Touch' and &quot;In Too Deep&quot;showed that the album had some fine moments. By the time 'I Can't Dance' came out in '91 the world had grown tired of Collins nasal whine and both the groups and his solo career went on a downward slide.<br /> The group decided to enlist the help of Stiltskin's Ray Wilson to take over on vocals on the truly dreadful &quot;Congo&quot;. It sort of completes the catalogue and brings us bang up to date. I do like the way they did include 2 Gabriel led tracks from the early years. The album ends and climaxes with a re-recording of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; which is taken from their definitive album &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;. It just shows the total the startling change with their music. The combination of the two contrasting sounds have always made Genesis one of the legends of rock music and makes this an album well worth having!
0790732254|5.0|I was a little worried before seeing this movie, because I had read the play and absolutely loved it.  I was worried that the movie would be water-downed and butchered like \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" which was forced to have that ridiculous ending in where evil was punished.  Well, I was happy to find out that none of that took place in this film.  \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is a triumph.<br />The actors did a terrific job in playing their characters.  The play is such a masterpiece that these people had to do their best to make sure that they did their characters justice.  Of course the two that stand out the most are Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.  Taylor was everything I had envisioned when reading the play, and did an outstanding job as Martha.  I was a little worried about Richard Burton at first because in the beginning he seemed so monotoned and stiff.  If you read the play, he is the most lively and bitter character in the play who pretty much runs the entire show.  Well, as the movie continued he proved to play an excellent George.  They couldn't had found a better person for the job.  The other two actors as the guests did a terrific job.<br />For it being such an old movie, it looks very good and clear.  And there is a widescreen version you can watch.  The sound is also good for being so old.  Sorry to say that there are no eye-popping special features, but believe me, you won't be missing them because this is such a great movie.<br />Congrats to Ernest Lehman, the person who wrote the screenplay, for keeping the movie true to the play and not giving into the pressure to make it appropriate.  No \\"Streetcar\\" repeat here.  It stays very similar to the play.  There are little differences, but nothing that dramatcially changes the story.  It starts and ends the same way.  I did like how the movie moves to different locations from time to time, but still stays similar to the story at the same time.  Mike Nichols did a very good job of directing as well.<br />I really enjoyed this movie, and it is one of my favorites.  If you haven't already, please read the play.  If you like the movie, you will love the play.  All in all, \\"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\\" is an outstanding achievement.  A classic movie that should be seen by all who enjoyed reading the play, or who just want to see a good movie.as well.<br />I really enjoyed this movie, and it is one of my favorites.

B000000W8C|5.0|Although the Verve is really only known for Bittersweet Symphony from 1997, they've been around longer than that. This CD runs across all emotions, from elation to introspection to the hopelessness of drug addiction.  It is the type of CD that you can put in and listen straight through without having to skip over any bad tracks.  I find that the rawness of the sound on this CD is one of the best things about it, and it fits the lyrics perfectly.  Speaking of lyrics, there are so many gems in this CD I couldn't list them, but even in the CD booklet there are just simple 2-line quotes from the songs that are mostly profound.  In my opinion, there are at least 6 or 7 'classic' songs on this CD.  A must have CD for anyone who enjoys music.
B000050XEI|5.0|You may think it an over statement, but I truly loved everything about this album.  I got lost in the soft melodies and classical styling.  The imagery often pushed me off to daydreaming of the settings that the lyrics had unfolded.  I forgot all the silly idiosyncrasies of pop culture and could only think of all things ideal.  Some say that certain musical compositions can enlist an altered state of consciousness in some of the listeners, without any real formula for this event.  Well, I was all there.  I got drunk on the feeling, of a lack of feeling.  It is auditory relaxation.
6305696071|1.0|The orginal release is a well-edited movie filled with some excellent sub-themes of self-worth, self-image, true selfless love versus lust, as well as a great visual lesson on real  friendship versus friendship built on using someone for personal gain (the two prostitues vs. the billioniare and his lawyer).<br />I rate the original movie five stars.  However, this new edition is a GREAT disappointment.  The additional scenes do not even match in lighting, etc. and create a poorly edited version of a great story.  The 'extra features' are sloppy and seem just tossed in to 'add value'.  I'm guessing the studio did not want to spend the extra money to get the cast to sit down and do some meaningful interviews.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY!  Buy the orginal version on DVD or Video.
B000058983|5.0|Top 20 of my 552 CD's collection( and yes, above The Beatles and Pink Floyd...), because of the sublime inspiration of a man called Arthur Lee. <BR> Songs like the strong pop-rocker &quot;A House Is Not A Motel&quot;, the melodic &quot;Old Man&quot;, the dark and ceptic &quot;The Red Telephone&quot;, the epic &quot;Live And Let Live&quot;, the ironic &quot;Alone Again Or&quot; or  the &quot;perfect pop song&quot; &quot;The Good Humor Man...&quot; are examples of the most genuine and total creativity in &quot;Forever Changes&quot;. But the truly gem of this record is &quot;You Set The Scene&quot;, a complex, sad and sublime song. The obvious &quot;stroke of genius&quot; of the whole album...<BR> What more can I say about this greatly 2001 edition of the original &quot;Forever Changes&quot;(1967). It reached only No. 154 on the Billboard charts. However, if you are a true music fan, I can assure you that we are talkin' about an essential and basic record for your collection. Pleasure for sure!
1558908498|4.0|I am a huge fan of the first film and since I have so much to say, I'll split this into the pros and cons of Scream 2.<br />CON: Unlike the first film, which perfectly paralleled satire of horror films with being an actual horror film (the scene where Randy tells the TV characters to look behind them when he should be following his own advice is an example of this...and pure cinematic gold!), this installment focuses more on satire (the Stab film and superficial sororrity sisters) then on plot and thrills.<br />CON: Sidney has less screen time.<br />PRO: Although Liev Schriber is technically in all 3 films, his biggest role is in this one.<br />PRO: In order to have both a high suspect list and body count, the film has a lot of characters.  However, unlike Scream 3, which doesn't know what to do with its characters and kills them all in succession, Scream 2 keeps good interplay and the result is a good ensemble performance.<br />PRO: I also think this installment has the best cast list of the trilogy: Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Omar Epps, Timothy Olyphant, and YES, even Ally McBeal's Portia de Rossi!!!<br />So what else can I say about Scream 2?  It's not as good as 1 but not as bad as 3.  I would reccomend it to fans of 1 and I probably wouldn't reccomend 3 to anyone.  It's not a classic, but as Cotton says, it's a hell of movie.
B000002L9J|5.0|The 80's were the decade where Pop and Rock artists began a huge preocupation in selling out their records. In the other hand we had bands that gave us true masterpieces of non-mainstream Pop/Rock, like R.E.M.(&quot;Murmur&quot;), Prefab Sprout (&quot;Two Wheels Good&quot;-U.S.A &quot;Steve McQueen&quot;-Europe), The B-52's (&quot;Wild Planet&quot;) or U2's &quot;War&quot;. &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; is among those masterpieces(and maybe above them all) as an album with no weak points. Sublime vocal interpretations by Morrissey, great rhythm section and simple but strong guitar notes give to this record an unique touch of inspiration. Because of this we have in our hands a so consistent work that turns things difficult to choose the best song in it. Probably the first track (the self-titled &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot;) is among the best ever wroten, but the other nine tracks are also sublime. <BR> I can hear this record, at once, thousands of times, and kept telling to myself that, in my 552 CD's collection, &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; is among the top 15 best albums EVER. Take one or two careful listens to this record and maybe you will find a truly musical-divine inspiration...
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The narrative device sounds iffy, but it works. As you follow the main character through his life you learn more and more of the truth, until the movie comes to its shattering climax, and you finally understand it all. The only problem is that you wind up watching the entire movie twice in one sitting -- it's just the way the story is told, and it's, well, kind of annoying. Still, a compelling story, and worth watching, at least once -- er, twice.
B000002KAT|5.0|Some may say that \\"Moondance\\" is the best Van Morrison album ever. Indeed it's a great musical work, but \\"Astral Weeks\\" is among the best records EVER. <BR> Music is the most abstract Art of all. That's what we can find in this album: 8 songs in the most pure simplicity. Van Morrison is not a perfectionist. His interpretations are directly from his soul and spirit, like he was deep inside the story he sings(listen, for instance, to \\"Cyprus Avenue\\" or \\"Madame George\\"...). <BR> \\"Astral Weeks\\" is pure poetry that matches perfectly well with the flute, violins and acoustic guitar sounds. \\"Pet Sounds\\"(The Beach Boys), \\"Revolver\\"(The Beatles), \\"Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\"(Pink Floyd), \\"Are You Experienced?\\"(The Jimi Hendrix Experience), \\"Forever Changes\\"(Love) or \\"Let It Bleed\\"(The Rolling Stones) are classical masterpieces from the Late-Sixties. Surely \\"Astral Weeks\\" is among those rare inspirated gems... Essential!
B00005JKJA|2.0|After Lost Highway I had almost given up. Remembering Fire Walk With Me, however, I gave Mulholland Dr. a shot. I should have remembered that Fire was a prequel to a series that went nowhere. Although Lynch must have felt a need to get an ending that made sense this time, he for some reason didn't feel a need to make a movie that makes sense most of the way through. Yes, the larger parts do tie together in the end, although hardly everything does. But just because the puzzle is difficult does not mean there's much joy in solving it -- the payoff, though eerie, was just too long in getting there, and the story too sloppy, and with too many never-explained turn, events, and whole characters, to warrant much interest. David Lynch, I see that you're trying, and I wish you the best, but that's the last time I plunck down my money to see one of your pictures. Ugh.
B000002H97|5.0|1991 was a year of some groundbreaking music.  Whether it was the beginning of the grunge movement with Nirvana's 'Nevermind' or Metallica's self titled album (more commonly known as the Black Album) which brought the band into the rock mainstream.  The Black Album took Metallica from being a very good heavy metal band to hard rock icons.  The album truly changed the heavy metal world but unfortunetly due to the bands success the supposedly \\"sold out\\"... They worked hard and made an awesome album.<br />Anyway the album itself is a hard rock masterpiece.  In my opinion it Metallica's best album.  Their songs were deeper, more poetic, they were at their musical brilliance and peak at this point in their careers.  It contains several of the band's biggest hits including ENTER THE SANDMAN, THE UNFORGIVEN, SAD BUT TRUE(which Kid Rock ripped off 9 years later) and the impressively groundbreaking ballad NOTHING ELSE MATTERS.  Although those are the hits the rest of the album is also awesome.  HOLIER THAN THOU is a great hard rocker.  WHEREVER I MAY ROAM is another ground breaking hard rocker.  DON'T TREAD ON ME is a classic.  THROUGH THE NEVER is a fast paced riff rocker that could have been a hit.  Then again a lot of the songs could have be hits on this album.  OF WOLF AND MAN is wild.  THE GOD THAT FAILED is aonther classic.  FRIEND OF MISERY is good and THE STRUGGLE WITHIN is an awesome closer.<br />Overall Metallica's Black Album is a classic.  I'm not much of a hard rock heavy metal fan but this is awesome.  This groundbreaking classic changed the music industry and many metal bands have tried to replicate it's success however none have succeed.  Highly recommended!
B00003CY5J|4.0|There are problems with the story, but the acting is brilliant, the sets are beautiful, the props are convincing, and in all it's a fun film, particularly for buffs of the thief/true-crime genre, of which there are sadly few really good films, probably the best of which is The Day of the Jackal. Now that was a five star film. But this was fun.
B00000JLWW|5.0|i saw this in the movies with my wife back in 1997 and wow what a surprise.i bought it a long time ago on dvd and just never wrote a review about it till now.the scene where jack dies and shes afloat is the sadest scene of any movie i ever watched. this movie was right up my alley like if they made it for me. a real awesome awesome flick. 5 stars is not enough it has to be 100.i thank you all for reading this. so long
B00005V9HA|3.0|Evil Dead II has spoiled me forever. The horror in this is a bit over the top, the special effects are, well, effective when they aren't a little funny (okay, so the cat was really scary when I was a kid, but less than compelling as an adult), and the acting is, well, bad. A low-budget classic? Yes. A must-see of cult cinema. Of course! A film you must own so you can watch it again and again? No. Catch it at a party, a midnight movie, with a bunch of friends at midnight before you start a really creepy movie like The Thing or even The House on Haunted Hill, but I wouldn't bother to buy it.
078322737X|5.0|this is a awsome movie that makes you feel right in the 50's and 60's. i saw this in the movies back in 1973. this movie has an unbelievable soundtrack. i love all the songs but my favorite is fanny mae by buster brown. that's an awsome song. that song was played in the scene where tode backed up his 58 chevy into the guy in back of him.great great movie.
0805062971|3.0|I can't remember saying this about any other work, but the movie is better than the book. The book has some great lines, but all those lines are delivered perfectly in the movie, and in more compelling situations. The folks who worked on the movie did an outstanding job, developing what is a slightly sketchy work into something much more complete and polished.<br />Silence of the Lambs? Great movie, a landmark. But an even better book.<br />Little Big Man? Another great movie, and yet, a way, way better book that will even make you feel betrayed by the movie!<br />Fight Club? Great movie, sign of the times. Passable book.
B00006690F|5.0|THE BONUS DVD IS FUNNY AS HELL, SO IF YOUR PLANNING ON BUYING THIS CD, YOU MIGHT AS WELL BY THIS LIMITED EDITION...PEACE
B00000JZJ0|2.0|Campy, silly horror, stressed story, poor acting, hit-and-miss effects. The not quite camp classic sequel to a camp classic that also is barely worth watching, and certainly not worth owning. Only for die hard fans of the original.
B000005HO0|5.0|The best Black Metal live album by far and the best Mayhem album. Not really much more to say then... Buy it!
6303461484|4.0|I saw this film when HBO first aired it, years ago, and I still have the homemade tape we recorded it on.  I'm glad to see that it's available commercially, and I'll happily recommend it.  It's certainly good enough to be remembered, not simply washed under \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"<br />This is a thriller that *means* something, showing us the life-ruining indifference, the villainy of blindness, that defined a really screwed-up, sick culture and period in history.  You learn a thing or two about responsibility, justice, and intelligence from this sadly true story.<br />And it's a fine thriller, besides, with the interesting wrinkle of showing how to get jsutice done in an unjust culture.  The way the killer is finally nabbed is something that we could never do here in America.  Meanwhile, it more than adequately scares the pants off of you, being far more openly violent than \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" or its ilk, while at the same time being less exploitative in the way it *handles* the violence.  That's quite an accomplishment, however unsettling.<br />This film will scare you. Not jsut because it's that kind of story, but because it really happened, and more importantly, because of WHY it happened.  To my mind, those facts make the sicko stylings of ordinary celluloid killers seem rather pale and silly.
6304981635|5.0|I am by no means a fan of the martial arts, but I enjoy and respect Bruce Lee movies.  Bruce Lee possessed unparalleled skills, evoked a sense of honor and commitment, and communicated the depth of his feelings and philosophy in each of his movies.  Enter the Dragon is a master's true masterpiece.  Unlike the martial arts films of today, which largely revolve around comedy, Enter the Dragon is possessed of a serious, somber, almost pious atmosphere.  Bruce Lee journeys to the island of Han, a man who betrayed the teachings of Lee's own temple, engaged in a life of drug trafficking and prostitution, and welcomed into his inner circle the man who was responsible for Lee's own sister's death.  There are acts of savagery committed, some fights ending in the death of one combatant, but the one true savage Lee must defeat is Han, an expert martial artist with a secret weapon.  The fight scenes are often elaborate and quite incredible, involving scores of men at times.  Lee's incredible talents and vision are showcased when he finds himself all alone in the midst of his attackers, but it is the final fight sequence that one most remembers from watching this movie.  That fight culminates inside a room of mirrors, the action sometimes being shown in slow motion.  With multiple images of the two combatants appearing at all sorts of angles, making it all but impossible to figure out where each man really is, the whole sequence is a surreal experience for the viewer.<br />In addition to the movie itself, which is inarguably Bruce Lee's best performance, one also gets bonus material: a short documentary of the making of the film in Hong Kong, an introduction by Lee's wife, and most importantly a documentary of interviews with Lee, in which he speaks eloquently of his philosophy, of which martial arts is the centerpiece.  Martial arts, he explains, is not really about fighting; it is the process which allows him to express himself to the utmost degree.  Many of his ideas and teaching are clearly reflected in Enter the Dragon, which only makes the movie more important.  Certainly, there is a lot of fighting in this movie (but nothing shocking by any means), but I would argue that Enter the Dragon is as much a philosophical argument as it is a fight movie.  This movie alone is a legacy Bruce Lee would be proud of.hing are clearly reflected in Enter the Dragon, which only makes the movie more important.

B00003CXQY|5.0|Okay, I have seen many many Disney animated films, and this is one of the best.  It's hysterically funny, with great characters and an enchanting plot.<br />The movie starts off with a spoiled-rotten emperor, Kuzco.  He wants to get of rid a quiet village on a hilltop to make way for his personal resort.  Pacha, a man from the village, comes to hear the news and is sent away feeling confused and hurt and angry.  In the meantime, Kuzco has fired his advisor, Yzma.  She is VERY upset.  She and Kronk, her henchman, make plans to get rid of Kuzco and take over the empire.  However, things turn sour when Kronk confuses poison with extract of llama.  Kuzco is then turned into a llama, and Kronk is sent to get rid of the body.  The body then ends up on Pacha's cart and goes home with him.  Kuzco and Pacha end up on a crazy adventure trying to get back to the palace to reverse the spell, while avoiding Yzma and Kronk.<br />I highly recommend this DVD to all lovers of comedy and animated films.  I especially recommend this version of it for people interested in the making and behind-the-scenes activities of animation.
B000002JKS|3.0|I bought this album when it was originally released and was very disappointed.  I was looking for something more similar to Plant's first two solo efforts, Principle of Moments, and Pictures at 11.   This album is a big departure from those albums and from previous Zeppelin works.  However, 15 or so years later, giving the album a second chance, I see that it is not so bad.  You have to have an open-mind to appreciate it though and not be expecting something similar to the prior works I mention.  It is more upbeat and seems less serious than the previous works.  It also features female background vocals on some songs, which were and still remain to me the least desirable element on the work.
B000066NW0|5.0|AVRIL IS SUCH A TALENTED SINGER. sHE HAS A AMAZING VOICE! SHE IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SINGER!
B0000636UN|2.0|C'mon C'mon is a lighter album that the Globe Sessions, and I really didn't like most of the sappy lyrics, and boring progressions. I still like her as an artist, but this album will probably be seeing more shelf time than the others.<br />There are a few interestingh tracks, but not enough of them pull this album into a decent 3 star rating.<br />Buy the Globe Sessions before you buy this one if you don't already have it -- even skip this one and hope she gets back that edge she lost somewhere.
B00000DFRS|1.0|\\"My Love Is Your Love\\" is Houston's worst attempt to date.<br />Setting out to recapture her waning R&B audience, Houston decides to go hip-hop, with horrific results. \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" is an experiment in trying to sound \\"hip\\" gone terribly wrong.<br />Most of this CD is very trendy.  Houston sounds like she's just going through the motions on \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", her duet with Kelly Price and Faith Evans. Her boring collaberation with Wyclef on the title track is a downright embarrassment. Most of the songs just seem out of place on a Whitney album. They sound like songs R. Kelly would write for one of his croonies.  Her attempt at Stevie Wonder's \\"I Was Made To Love Him\\" is a joke!  Check out a much better cover on Chaka Khan's \\"Chaka\\" CD.  It's obvious this is who Whitney was trying to imitate but she fails miserably.<br />It's only when Houston is not trying to sound trendy is really when she shines. \\"I Learned From the Best\\" is a great Soul song. Houston sounds like she is really enjoying herself on this cut.  Even \\"It's Not Right, But It's Okay\\" finds Whitney more believeable and sounding like she is actually enjoying herself (the 'smooth' version on the maxi single is much better than the album version).<br />This CD was recorded around the time Houston began to experience some \\"personal\\" problems, which may explain her rather erratic vocal performance on this album.<br />Hopefully, by the time the next album drops, Houston will have gotten her act together and she will once again bless us with some decent music and let the trendiness go.
B000000W71|5.0|I heard the song Parisienne Walkways on tv and decided to check into who performed it, and it was Gary Moore. So.. I bought this CD knowing nothing about him or his music and was very pleasantly surprised. I think this is a great CD if you like jazz, blues, rock, etc. - it really has a mix of many different types of music and I could detect influences in the music from a variety of different groups, like the Scorpions, Journey, and Dire Straits. The CD has 14 tracks, and all of them are long, so it's a really good deal too.
0156907399|4.0|Virginia Woolf wrote this book in 1927.  It must have been courageous for her do so at the time as it's all stream of consciousness and she lets the reader get a glimpse inside her thought processes.  The very slight plot focuses on a vacationing British family and their guests and there's a constant interior monologue about every little thing.<br />The first part, entitled &quot;The Window&quot; is by far the largest section of the book and the reader has to plow though a complex web of the author's thoughts as she focuses on one detail after another using all her senses.  True, she's a gifted writer and deeply explores the relationships between men and women, focusing mainly on Mrs. Ramsay, the matriarch of the family.  It's as if everything is in the background and the only thing in the foreground is what she has in her head.<br />The second part, entitled &quot;Time Passes&quot; is perhaps the strongest part of the book.  It focuses on an empty house and its details of decay over a ten year period.  It is masterfully done.<br />The third part, entitled &quot;The Lighthouse&quot; is about the remaining members of the family, who come back to the house in order to take a trip to the lighthouse which has been postponed for ten years.  It's all very symbolic and the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions about the meaning of it all.<br />This is the only Virginia Woolf book I've ever read and although I can appreciate the skill of the author, I'm not interested in reading any more of her works and can recommend this book only for fans of hers as well as those with a curiosity about her writing.
0312265859|5.0|I started reading this last night and couldn't put it down.  While it's a little darker than the last 7 books, it's got some great moments in it.  I can't wait for 9 to come out so I can find out where Stephanie's relationship with her ex-finace' -  Mortelli goes. At the end, they are back together (somewhat). I also hope Janet Evanovich gives Grandma more of a role in Book 9.  That woman has lots of character.  A must read!
B00004U8P9|5.0|Yes, this movie is very bizzare and includes weird, disgusting sexual content, but true movie lovers look beyond that. Brilliant acting, get-up-and-dance songs, and wonderful (yet bizzare) costumes, make this a must see film for anybody who calls themselves a movie lover.<br />Although, it altogether doesn't really deserve its R rating, still be warned this isn't a kids movie, so forget O'Brien's quote \\"It's a film any 10 year old boy would enjoy...\\" Notice the key word there \\"would.\\" This movie is on my TOP 5 MOVIE LIST, but I don't consider myself a \\"Frankie Fan,\\" or Rocky Horror worshipper. Most people don't even give it a chance after hearing it's about a transexual transvestite alien that made a creation just to have sex with him...so don't let that scare you away.<br />By the time the movie's halfway over, when everyone's singing and you're singing along, you really don't give a [heck] who's having sex with who, you just want to get up and dance!
B000066NW0|4.0|If you liked Alanis' breakthrough album, you will love Avril.  Even in the credits Avril thanks her ex- &quot;bois&quot; for giving her the inspiration to write these songs.  Most of the songs are up beat, even if the lyrics aren't so up beat, and it is hard not to listen to every last song through.  A particular favorite, &quot;sk8ter boi&quot; (original and cute title) has a cool story line to it, and although it is young (I said young, not immature) it quickly grows on you.  Avril gives off a tough, edgy, independent air and any girl no matter how old cant help but admire her.  It is definitly worth a listen.
B00000K19E|5.0|Let's get one thing straight: There is not one bad thing about this movie! I don't care who you are, if you haven't seen this movie you don't know what you're missing out on! This movie is 100% original with wonderful acting, top-notch story, wonderful special effects and the latest, best fight and gun sequences ever made! This is a must have for everyone. You also might want to consider picking up the soundtrack to this film if you love rock :)
B00006690G|5.0|This is Eminem's third and best album so far. The Slim Shady LP was a solid debut, but lack continuity as it was a mixture of material recorded before and after he signed with Dre. On the Marshall Mathers LP, Eminem resorted to shock lyrics, despite making a great album it lacked any personability. On The Eminem Show, Mathers uses his provocative lyrics along side an in depth look into his life. This creates an album that fans and critics have been waiting for.<BR>On tracks like \\"Sing for the Moment\\", \\"Hailie's Song\\", and \\"Say Goodbye Hollywood\\", the listener gets an inside look into the mind of Eminem, something not previously divulged in past albums. On \\"Sing for the Moment\\" Eminem gives a great inside look into the actions of rap artists. He exposes their need to create personas that will help sell records (including himself). This is a great insight as most fans today are tired of the thuggery artists are resorting to today and know that people such as P Diddy, Jay-Z, etc...aren't hardcore, but must create this perception to the audience so they can sell their music.<BR>On songs like \\"White America\\", \\"Business\\", \\"Without Me\\", and \\"\\"Till I Collapse\\" Eminem showcases his knowledge of what's going on in the world and in the music world. One of the most important issues brought up is how does being white affect him in the rap industry. Sure it helps his sales, but will he ever be considered one of the best rappers, rather than the best white rapper? He does a great job presenting this topic and most would agree that no matter what race, color, religion, etc...a good musician is a good musician, and Eminem just wants equal respect.<BR>The album isn't without its slipups though. \\"Drips\\" featuring Obie Trice is a bad song. It has a good beat, but the concept and lyrics seem lazy and rushed. Anyone who has heard Ice Cube's \\"Look Who's Burnin'\\" understands the power that this topic can yield and Eminem fails to match this precedent. \\"Superman\\" seems like a song Eminem threw together quickly and is filled with a myriad of bitter lyrics as he tried to fill one song with a list full of petty insults.<BR>All in all this album is a triumph as Eminem lets the listener closer inside his mind than ever before. Touching songs to his daughter create a view of him that most did not have before. This album also cut out some of the shock lyrics and replaced them with intelligent concepts that Eminem banters back and forth. My overall grade for the album is 4.5 stars, as it is his best album to date. However for the most part Eminem fans and Eminem detractors have already picked their sides and most know whether they will buy this album or not. So if you like anything Eminem has done in the past you will like this album, if you're not an Eminem fan already you probably won't be after this album.

0553208845|4.0|I read this book in my junior year of college.  I thought it was profound.  It was one of my favorite books.  I'm glad I re-read it now that I am 51-years-old. It is not one of my favorite books anymore.<br />Siddhartha is fine literature and deeply insightful.  It traces the life of an intelligent, sensitive young man of Eastern (Buddhist?) spirituality; from his youthful studies with the masters, through a period of self-conscious asceticism and self-rejection, through a period of self-indulgence and sensuality, ultimately to self-knowledge and peace as he becomes a ferryman living humbly in a small hut beside a river which teaches him many of the ultimate truths of life.<br />Siddhartha has a shortcoming that I did not see when I was young but I see now.  This book is always and only about the self.  Even when he finds salvation - Siddhartha finds it in himself.  The path towards salvation is only internal - coming from self-denial, self-examination, self-discipline, self, self, self... Where compassion, charity, humility, and love exist, they exist as by-products of self-knowledge.<br />There are a great many truths in Siddhartha.  Young people who are seeking should read this book.  Siddhartha looked into the river and saw that life does not change.  I suggest that things do change - and they change as a result of what we do.  Like the young Siddhartha, the young reader of this book should pause for a while, then grow and move on.  There are bigger things outside the self.  You will find that Robert Frost spoke more truly when he said &quot;[you] have promises to keep.&quot;

B00003CX5P|5.0|I had never been a fan of Star Wars before this movie-I was a kid then, sure that the Science Fiction of Star Wars was a bunch of confusing mumbo jumbo, weird, dumb, boring. We had watched one in 3rd grade, I didn't even watch it at all. <BR>But you know, I'd had never cared enough to see them. Never even given it a chance.<BR>I was in 6th grade-I believe. It was in a Time for Kids magazine. An article about this movie-me first thinking &quot;oh, stupid old Star Wars&quot; absent mindedly. But, that afternoon, I was stuck in the car with my older sister, (an 8th grader at the time) wiht only this magazine to entertain us. <BR>As we looked through the two pages dedicated to this movie, we became a little interested-&quot;This doesn't look so bad&quot; we were thinking. I remember Queen Amidala's headdress catching my eye. &quot;Who is this?&quot; I wondered. It seemed very interesting.<BR>As we informed my dad how this movie didn't look so horribly unbearable, He told us &quot;Yeah, Star Wars. The originals are very good. I've tried to tell you before.Sure, we can go and see it.&quot; <BR>I remember the night we had planned-my dad was getting home late from a job he had to do-and I was actually nervous. What if he didn't get home in time for us to see this movie? I had a feeling inside-a feeling that somehow, this was going to be a movie I would really enjoy. <BR>He turned up a little late, and we arrived in the theater as the &quot;STAR WARS, EPISODE I THE PHANTOM MENACE&quot; Writing screen was scrolling. I sat down, a little more excited than I thought I would EVER be about 'stupid old Star Wars'.<BR>It really saddens me-honestly, makes me very very sad-how badly this movie is ripped apart. As I left the movie theater, I was enthralled, entranced-and most of all, totally SURPRISED. Star Wars wasn't dumb, old, or stupud. It was AWESOME, AMAZING, IMAGINATIVE-and more than I ever thought it would EVER be. <BR>I watched the other Three later the same week-and loved them, finding my favourite character, Leia, and just loving these movies even more. <BR>Jar Jar Binks is a fresh, halarious, comic relief character-he had me laughing so many times, and made me really love him fro all his thousand faults. Star Wars is made with love and effort, by a man who has a vivid imagination and a love for what he does. Jar Jar was meant ot be a lovebale, funny, great chracacter-and that is exactly what I think of him as. <BR>The actors portrayed roles not easily filled with perfection and an amazing quality that kept me in this movie. <BR>I love it-I will love it forever. Star Wars will always be special to me-it showed me a new world and a new way to look at everything. It has charm, humor, wit, heart and of course, The Force. And I don't mind at all if I am pelted with  Unhelpful votes. <BR>Star Wars will always be...Star Wars, to me. <BR>And that's all that there is to it.
B000066NW0|5.0|avril's cd is colorful..makes you feel alive.  she's got such a great variety...like a happy 'Sk8r Boi'...to a dark 'Unwanted.'  usually there's only a few songs on a cd that i really love, but with 'Let Go'..i loved them all!!
B00005ARDC|4.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club are three scruffy lads with a British sound, not unlike The Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre. Based on the pics in the CD booklet, one can picture these guys strumming their guitars and pounding away at the drums in a dark, smoky venue somewhere -- and they could be playing large venues someday, if the right song strikes a nerve with the masses.<br /><br />The single \\"Whatever Happened To My Rock 'N' Roll\\" (a song indicative of the times when it was released, which I saw on the once great MTV2) is as fast and punk-sounding as these guys usually get. Mostly, though, B.R.M.C. rely on a gentler fuzzy sound that can explode on a whim with giant melodic power chords that grab you by the throat, a la vintage Dandy Warhols (see [[ASIN:B000002U2S The Dandy Warhols Come Down]]). The sharp-sounding \\"Love Burns\\" truly does contain guitars that burn, as does \\"Red Eyes and Tears.\\" After the first three tracks, the album takes a decidedly softer turn, not a bad thing.<br /><br />Singer Peter Hayes (formerly of Brian Jonestown Massacre) sounds terrific on the mesmerizing and catchy \\"Rifles,\\" which has a dreamy sound that could go on forever without growing tired. Another standout track is the CD's last one, \\"Salvation,\\" a practically transcendent piece of work that almost does have a spiritually saving feel to it. Other tracks with the same meaningful and pleasant aura include \\"White Palms,\\" \\"Too Real\\" and \\"Head Up High.\\"<br /><br />Though it can rock out with the best of them (see [[ASIN:B0000BV1ZE Take Them On, On Your Own]]), B.R.M.C. possess a relaxed vibe that doesn't get too complicated. The band is focused and real, it's got all the right musical ingredients, and you can tell the guys wouldn't mind making it big. B.M.R.C. is just another example of a great band who should be on the radio more often and aren't, for whatever reason. Like The Hives, these guys haven't reinvented their genre, but they do represent it very well.
0312265859|3.0|Even though I count down the days until mid June every year for the next Stephanie Plum adventure, I think maybe we should give Janet Evanovich a bit of a break.  She might need a little more time to write the ninth adventure.  Although this book is the next logical step in the series, Ranger came off scarier than the bad guy, Abruzzi.  Beginning and end of the book were still gigle aloud, but the middle read slowly--and I stay up all night to read the new book the day it comes out.  Hang in there, Janet, and give us a release date in 2 years for Nine.
B0000640SA|1.0|This movie wasn't very good, and not nearly as good as I thought it would be.  Read the above guy's review and you wan't have to waste your money on this pseudo-intellectual pig.  If you want something to wrap your mind around, get Waking Life by Richard Linklater.
0805062971|4.0|The theme of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, Fight Club, is that 21st century male has given up his life of adventure and passion in exchange for a life of passive consumption.  <br />I was first turned off by Fight Club's title and movie trailers thinking it was just another silly and mindless expression of entertainment.<br />I was delightfully proved when I discovered that the fight club itself is merely a backdrop into a meaningful discussion about the direction and quality of one's life.  Hundred's of men across the country are intoxicated by the passion and sounds of the fight one night a week, but they are also drawn into the self-discovery in which figh club leads them.<br />They subject themselves to such self-destruction because only then do they really feel alive.  Some would scoff at such a definition of life.  But that's the point really.  Only through fight club do these men awake to the reality that in their \\"normal\\" and safe lives they are in fact, on an aimless walk whose direct target is a meaningless death beyond the horizon of tomorrow.<br />Will you agree with every conclusion, strategy, and goal presented by Tyler Durden's underground society?  <br />No.  But again, that's the point.  <br />Most of us never agreed or understood the mission statement our boss handed us.  We just adopted it for our jobs and our lives.  \\"Work harder, consume more more more more.\\"  And if we took a good hard look at our lives right now, would we agree with every conclusion, strategy, and goal you think you live by?<br />No.  And that's the point of Fight Club - to get us to finally reckon with ourselves and the meaning of our lives, knowing that when we die, no one after our grandchildren will remember us.
6305313687|5.0|its a great, powerful movie, wth amazing acting in it. i loved every second of it- its so real and... there are just no words to describe the feeling one gets out of watching it. you get to hate your ancestry. WATCH IT!!!
0553260111|5.0|I read the book when I saw the trailer for the movie. The book was so awesome that I was pumped to see the movie. The first day it came out I went to see it. They didn't even have Carlos!!! Do yourself a favor and stick with the book. It was hard to put down.
6300215814|5.0|Audrey Hepburn stars in this charming comedy about a wanna-be New York sophisticate who finally admits she wants and needs real love, from a cat and a man.  Audrey is stunningly beautiful here.  You cannot take your eyes off her.  She's also very believable as a girl from the rural south who came north to make it big. George Peppard is perfect as her down-to-earth boyfriend.  You'll never forget this great movie.
0446608955|5.0|This is a great book. It is about a typical high school senior named Landen who has decided to participate in the school's Christmas play rather than take a harder subject that he just can't slide through. He meets Jamie, the reverends daughter, and begins to fall in love with her. It's a typical love story, but it's up to you to decide whether they have a happy ending or not. I knew the ending to the book, and I still cried for the last 2 chapters, and I didn't even cry at the movie. This book is extremely moving.
B000002LRX|5.0|I started listening to Faith No More when i received their first album with their singer (Mike Patton). The real thing was a solid, funky, heavy, and overall great record. After digesting that album for a little while i decided to explore their later and less accesible work. After getting opinions and reading reviews, i concluded that most true Faith No More fans believe Angel Dust to be their finest work. I have come to Agree totally.<BR>     The beginning of the record starts out with the dark and twisted, yet irresistably catchy tune of \\"Land of Sunshine\\". While this album tends to differ much from \\"The Real Thing\\", one factor is present from the start of this album; Mike Patton's flexible and amazing voice is in it's prime condition, topping his efforts on their previous album. He goes from his nasal pitched tone associated with the hit \\"epic\\" to the powerful bellow of what could be mistaken for an opera singer's in a minute's worth of time.<BR>     After the opener \\"Land of Sunshine\\" Faith No More experiments even further with the grinding number \\"Caffeine\\". Musical variety is even more present in this album than before. Also, the keyboardist, Roddy Bottum is employed for even more affectiveness.<BR>     There is almost always one standout musician in every band, and that award would have to go to the drummer, Mike Bordin. He lays down intricate and complex drum rythyms as if it was as easy as writing your own name. Faith No More would have never been the same if they had a different, less talented drummer in replacement of Mike. I hear he's working with Ozzy osbourne in conjunction with some ex-members of Alice in Chains. God bless them all.<BR>     I'll lay down descriptions for all the tracks:<BR>1. Land of Sunshine. Funky and dark, a great opener and personal favorite.<BR>2. Caffeine. Grinding and harsh, yet so great at the same time.<BR>3. Midlife crisis. Not truly a \\"rock\\" song but more of a rambling with Patton employing his unique style of rapping backed by a funky basslien and softer-than-normal insturmentals.<BR>4. RV. Weird, little piano-based ditty about some middle-aged fogey living in a mobile home and complaining about his abusrd problems. Wonderfully catchy.<BR>5. Smaller and Smaller. A harsh foreboding number bearing resemblence to \\"Caffeine\\".<BR>6. Everything's Ruined. Darker funk than the other three funky tracks (Land of Sunshine, Be Agressive, and A Small Victory)<BR>7. Malpractice. A disturbing song that is more akin to the heavier tracks \\"Caffeine\\" \\"Smaller and Smaller\\" and \\"Jizzlober\\".<BR>8. Kindergarten. Song about a guy who can't graduate from kindergarten. Strange and heavy, but more melodic than the four heavy tracks mentioned above.<BR>9. Be Agressive. Funkyfunkyfun. Has a cheerleader chorus that will stick in your head like a tumor.<BR>10. A Small Victory. Upbeat number about heaven knows what.<BR>11. Crack Hitler. Sounds like something that came from a spy thriller soundtrack. Actually has really nothing to do with one of the most hated men in history.<BR>12. Jizzlobber. Chaotic and heavy.<BR>and out of nowhere comes... 13. Midnight Cowboy. Would belong well in a western film. Random, but great closer.<BR>I love this whole album. It's one my only albums that I loved at first listen and has stuck with me the whole time. I reccommend getting \\"The Real Thing\\" first and letting your musical mind digest it for awhile before getting this odd, little masterpiece.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album starts out strong with Smells Like Teen Spirit and keeps on going until the end without a dull moment between.<BR>Nevermind is, in my oppinion, as good as any previous Nirvana release. <BR>The entire band played well, with strong guitar riffs and outstanding vocals by Kurt. <BR>Any fan of rock/punk really ought to own this album.
0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris is hilarious.  All of his essays made me laugh out loud, getting a few strange looks from my family.  From lisp problems, to learning french, and being thought of as a pick pocketer, you will love this book!!
B000002KXO|4.0|This album suffers the same fate as Tusk did.  What record executive in their right mide expects a band to sell 20 million copies everytime out.  And then call a 4 million seller a flop, they were expecting to much.  And for that reason Fleetwood Mac had to take two steps backwards and bring out Mirage.  All in all a good album, Stevie Nicks makes one of her best contributions of her Fleetwood Mac career with &quot;Gypsy&quot;, and so does Christine McVie with &quot;Hold Me&quot;.  Artistically absent on this album is Lindsey Buckingham whose songs, while good songs to listen to, lack something his previous work had.  The album all together sounds to pop and was a dangerous step for this band to take.  They would recover in 5 years with Tango In The Night only to fall back again with Behind the Mask in 1990.  This is a good album for anyone who is a serious Mac fan but not recomended for the casual listener.
B00000JZIK|4.0|Christopher McQuarrie's Academy Award winning, original screenplay, coupled with Bryan Singer's masterful direction of a stellar cast, makes for a complex and absorbing film. Told in flashback, the film recounts how five individuals on the wrong side of the law hook up to steal a multi-million dollar cache of cocaine from a docked vessel.<br />Led by former Los Angeles detective turned bad guy, Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne), Roger \\"Verbal\\" Kint (Kevin Spacey), Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), Todd Hockey ((Kevin Pollack), and Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), proceed to their rendevous point and begin executing their plan of action. Their foray into this million dollar drug heist turns bad almost immediately. Something or someone is afoot who does not want them to succeed, and who seems to know their every move.<br />The story is told in flashback by \\"Verbal\\" Kint, a club footed, crestfallen, soft spoken, unlikely looking criminal. He recounts the details of the doomed heist to hardnosed Detective, David Kujan (Chazz Palmentieri), building his story around an almost mythic, Hungarian crime lord named Keyser Soze. As \\"Verbal\\" details what happened, the viewer is mesmerized by his compelling narrative of how he and his partners in crime were inveigled into attempting this daring heist, which ultimately led to the disastrous events that culminated on the ship. It seems that their heist was probably destined to be doomed from the start, as another agenda may have been paramount to theirs.<br />Kevin Spacey won a 1995 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his low key, ingratiating portrayal of \\"Verbal\\" Kint. Gabriel Byrne also gives a compelling performance as the cop who ended on the wrong side of the law. The rest of the cast also give stellar performances, with the exception of Benicio Del Toro, who gives an odd, marble mouthed performance. Notwithstanding this, the film is really a splendid tour de force that is sure to captivate the viewer. Who is the mythic Keyser Soze? Watch the film and find out.yser Soze? Watch the film and find out.
B000002H33|5.0|I am amazed by this music, simply put. This gem of the 80s metal scene is driven by pounding guitars. Pounding, not noisy, or extremely dissedent, mind you. Hetfield lays down the rythym with his rapidly played guitar chords. Songs like the speed metal album opener \\"Battery\\", which begins with a beautiful classic guitar duet between hetfield and hammett only gets better as the song progresses. The thrash element of this song is fueled by the blazingly fast chords played by Hetfield. It makes you wonder how he manages to sing at the same time.<BR>     Another one of my favorite elements of Metallica's music is the excellent lead guitar and soloing work excecuted perfectly by Hammett. Whether he is pumping up the pounding spirit of one of their quicker numbers or powering one of their slower numbers (Welcome Home (Sanatarium)), he is always one of my favorite parts of their music. Lars and Cliff are also good, solid musicians.<BR>     I can say with all my truth and confidence intact that this is an excellent purchase for any fan of heavy music with good tastes. Also, to any nu-metal fans from an ex nu-metal fan: Try this out, it's better and more complex than any mainstream radio-friendly clones that may be out there right now.
B000002B7M|5.0|I have to admit that the whole reason I first listened to this album and Ozzy in general was because I liked the Crazy Train video. I borrowed this CD from a friend and I love it! Ozzy's vocals are great (plus you can actually understand him while he's singing (grin), Rand Rhode's guitar work is superb, and the song writing is excellent. <BR>Personally, I don't think Ozzy's leaving Sabbath was such a bad idea. After all, who just released a new album last year and who hasn't been hear from in over a deacde?
0811828697|5.0|My two major interests are Star Wars and animals, so this book is just about my favorite Star Wars reference book ever. The art is just amazing, and the book is done in a very realistic style, with dirt smudges and the like. So much detail was put into the drawings that some appear to jump off of the book and into reality, as if your were watching the Star Wars version of Animal Planet. You will want to read this book over and over, even if you are just beginning to like Star Wars, or if you are a seasoned veteran of the saga
6302510414|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King Kong\\" and takes him back to New York with them on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, \\"King Kong\\" makes his memorable debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is a truly timeless, cinema classic. Bravo!<br /><br />Collectors may wish to obtain this VHS 60th anniversary edition, as the box in which the video cassette is housed was specially created to commemorate this cinematic event. Press the box over King Kong's chest, and hear it roar!Bravo!<br /><br />Collectors may wish to obtain this VHS 60th anniversary edition, as the box in which the video cassette is housed was specially created to commemorate this cinematic event.

B00000I480|5.0|It's one of the best CDs I listened. The DS's way to make music is the most original way. I have only one word to descript this album: Lovely
B00000K19E|5.0|I've watched this movie probably 250 times by the time I'm now writing this, and every time I see it again I still find it to be one of the very best science fiction movies I've ever seen.  It's the kind of movie you never get bored with.<br />In the beginning, I had a hard time figuring out who was the good guy, in the middle I was saying \\"what the ...?\\" and by the end I was wanting to see it again and actually liking Keanu Reeves as an actor.<br />One thing I definitely noticed were the whole Second Coming overtones:<br />- Morpheus as John the Baptist<BR>- Cipher as Judas<BR>- A character named \\"Trinity\\"<BR>- Neo dying once and being resurrected<BR>- Morpheus' ship named the Nebuchadnezzar<BR>- etc. etc. etc.<br />At any rate, I thought that this was a pretty cool spin on an old prophecy, not to mention the Taoist themes as well.  <br />The Matrix is definitely a package deal - you get plot, effects, action, drama, even martial arts all in one movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, you should.
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's c.d., \\"Let Go\\", is now the best c.d. i have EVER listened to and I'm POSITIVE that it will always be my favorite. She has a song on that c.d. for every single thing I go through and every single thing i ever feel. It's always nice to know someone has felt the way you do and you're not alone. Also, she has inspired me so much. My dream is to be a singer and write my own songs, and listening to her c.d. made me so eager to just get up to California or New York (I live in Alabama) and get started on something I've ALWAYS dreamed of. \\"Losing Grip\\" gets all my anger out when I'm mad about ANYTHING. \\"Complicated\\" makes me know I shouldn't do something just because someone else does and I should be my own person. \\"sk8er boi\\" is just a fun song that makes me want to go up to a prep and just laugh in their face. \\"With You\\" makes me feel like I'm not alone, and no matter who it is, someone is always gunna be there for me. \\"Mobile\\" has almost made me cry alot-haha. The acustic guitar on that song [is great]!!! That's one of the reasons I love it so much. I like it because I can relate to it alot. \\"Unwanted\\" makes me so mad when I listen to it, but it helps get all my anger out. It just makes me hate fake people...like, if you don't like me, just say it and don't pretend. \\"Tomorrow\\"...I just love it because I can relate to it the most. \\"Anything But Ordinary\\" makes me want to go out and conqour the world! It makes me want to do everything and know that \\"I have been to the extreme.\\" \\"Things I'll never say\\" is such a sweet song. I love listening to it. And, by the way Avril, you did finally say it...in your song. Ironic, huh? \\"My World\\" makes me want to BE her, but then I think, that defeats the purpose of the song because it's all about her being herself, and I need to do the same thing. \\"Nobody's Fool\\" is my FAVORITE song on the WHOLE c.d. and in the WHOLE world. I want to say all that to someone-I'm me, and there's not a thing in the world you can do to make mechange JUST because you don't like the way I am. I dont care what you think. The guitar on it is great], too. \\"Too Much To Ask\\" makes me hate some of the guys in this world so much. I feel really lucky that I haven't experienced one like that...yet. \\"Naked\\" is a really powerful song. Like, all she needed was a little push to take control of her own life. Avril is my favorite person in the world, literally. She has her own style, she thinks for herself, she doesnt let ANYONE or ANYTHING get in the way of what she wants to do. She's my #1 idol. I'm her #1 fan.
B000007UA4|2.0|I'm usually a big Kylie fan, but this is probably one of my least fav albums. It's just too boring and sounds very out of date...pop just wasn't that good in the early 90's. But there are some tracks that I do like: &quot;Right here, right now&quot; is ok and I've always had a soft spot for &quot;Guess I like it like that&quot;. The rest though...is pretty boring. Don't buy it unless it's on sale or if you've had the chance to listen to the tracks first.
0312265859|5.0|They just keep getting better.  How do you do it?  I have to admit, other than the humor, what keeps me and many friends intrigued and coming back again and again, is the Ranger/Morelli dilemma.  You've created an even greater dilemma with Eight and we'll have a great time arguing a resolution.  <br />Some have said that Eight is a bit darker than previous books, but it reminded me more of One and Two in the series.  Can't get much darker than Ramirez.  Dark, light, whatever, just keep em coming (Steph, Ranger and Morelli that is).<br />Thanks Again
B00003CXI1|5.0|Despite the many of you who thought the cast was poorly chosen , I dont ithink it was chosen very well. If you think about it everybody looks just like the charecters from the book. As for the story they did leave out a couple important parts , however the movie would be way to long if it included them all. You would never be able to make a movie like The Goblet of Fire and include all the details without it being several hours longer than a normal movie. As for other reviewes like philip you obviously don't understand that the Harry Potter series goal is not to teach life lessons , but to take you away to a place you wish that you could go to , And it accomplished that!<BR>If you liked the books (i loved them!) , than you will love the movie as well.
B000065U1N|3.0|First off let me say this- PLATOON was crap, FULL METAL JACKET was a sleeper, APOCALYPSE NOW was a fantasy, and PEARL HARBOR was so terrible WWII vets walked out of it in the theater.  Now that I have said my piece on \\"great war films,\\" allow me to comment on this \\"great war film.\\"  It was ok.  At best it was good.  Yes, it had great action, lots of death, but it was a disgrace to the men of Task Force Ranger.  The movie took TOO much creative license when it came to characters and certain events.  I doubt very much that Shawn Nelson appreciates the way in which he was portrayed.  I know for a fact that men of TFR feel the Pilla was poorly portrayed thus dishonoring his memory.  Those are only a few of the problems facing this movie. Sure it was pretty to look at and had great camera angels and pretty shots of the pretty helicopters. In the end, though, this movie was just a work of fiction that used real men's names and a real event to push it.  Bowden should never have allowed it to be made. One should know that the man who brought us ARMAGEDDON could never pull off a project such as this.  For those of us who served in the Infantry it is just another Hollywood screw-up.  It hits close to the mark, but it is just not quite there.<br />Now onto the VERY disappointing DVD.  This is the most bare-bones DVD you can buy.  It has ONE special feature, which is an \\"On The Set\\" documentary that spends half of it's time rehashing the plot of the movie and not really telling us about how it was made.  The DVD boasts that it has theatrical trailers, well I was hoping for the BHD trailers, but instead I got The One and Spiderman.  Since the DVD included no deleted scenes the buyer is left to assume one of two things, either A) there ARE no deleted scenes, or B) we will be shelling over another $30 when Black Hawk Down: Special Edition DVD comes out.  This DVD feels rushed, almost as if the suits just wanted to get it out quick and make the quick buck and will later follow it with a quality product.  At least I hope they will follow it up with a quality product.  All in all, the DVD was a real let down, just like the movie itself.<br />If you are a military enthusiast then buy this DVD. If you want a decent depiction of modern Army tactics and weapons buy this DVD.  If you want to know what happened at The Battle of the Black Sea, buy the book and read it. Lastly, if you want a GREAT WAR MOVIE, then be patient and wait and buy WE WERE SOLDIERS, it was the only respectful war film I have seen based on anything other than WWII, and the only good Vietnam film ever.ith a quality product.

0312265859|5.0|I love the Stephanie Plum Series.  This was a great addition.  I loved the twist and turns that Evanovich always delivers.  If you haven't read the first 7, don't start here.  You'll enjoy them all.  The no cliffhanger ending leaves me worried, I have to have to more.
B000050XEI|5.0|Whata great CD! Who could not love ENYA! She's amazing! I especially love tracks 2 &amp; 4.
B000002WYT|5.0|I've been a DMB fan for years now, and I must say that this is the best album by the band so far.  This is the album where the band really honed their sound into a rock/jazz/funk/blues fusion that pretty much destroys all the n-metal garbage out there today as far as talent and craftsmanship is concerned.  Every song on this album is absolutely amazing, and every song showcases the amazing talents of each band member on their respective instruments.  Being a drummer/percussionist myself, I can't help but drop my jaw and shed a tear at Carter Beauford's unbelievable drumming.  The man is a GOD.  Dave is an amazing vocalist and guitarist, despite what some people think.  Leroi blows his guts out on the saxes, flutes, and whistles, and Boyd probably broke about 100 violin bows recording this album.  Stefan is excellent, but I wish he would showcase some mad skills a little bit more.  Oh well...it doesn't detract from anything.  If you are a Dave newbie (and that's ok if you are), then you've probably heard songs like \\"The Space Between\\" and \\"Everyday\\" on the radio recently.  Pay that album no mind.  I mean, no offense to the band, but the album \\"Everyday\\" just plain [stinks].  It's too watered down, and I know they can play and write a lot better than that.  If you're looking for the REAL Dave Matthews Band experience, then buy this album as soon as possible.  Pick up \\"Under The Table and Dreaming\\", \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\", \\"Live at Red Rocks\\", and pretty much everything else they've ever released while you're at it.  You will not be disappointed.
0783217048|3.0|Fun, harmless entertaining. Nothing to get excited about, but it is amusing thanks to it's strange casting choices. Any movie with Stockard Channing has to have some merit! Swayze and Snipes are fun and Rosie Perez (oops!) is hysterical. Leguizamo deserves a lot more recognition for his body of work.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Meth and Red are a perfect duo.  Rza should have done more tracks, but all in all, this is a great, funny album.
B00005R5G9|1.0|If you remember this movie fondly from when you were younger, fine. Whatever floats your boat. We all have guilty pleasures of some kind.<br />For anyone else, in case all these other good reviews have you fooled, this is a bad movie. Really bad. It was assembled out of used parts in the Stock 80's Romantic Comedy Factory. Even if you're comfortable with the absurd premise (Weird Science without the science), the plot is completely transparent, and within 10 minutes you will foresee every single thing that happens in this movie. Of course, there have been comedies that have been really funny even though the premise and the plot were old hat. But this movie just isn't very funny either, and that's what dooms it. The &quot;humor&quot; is primarily comprised of weak, obvious situation comedy moments.<br />Kim Cattrall is a pretty decent comedienne, but Andrew McCarthy is one of the worst actors who's ever been allowed to be the lead in a major studio release. Worse than Keanu. Almost as bad as Chris O'Donnell. If anyone doubts me, go rent Less Than Zero and note how he completely destroys that movie by playing exactly the same guy he plays in every movie he's ever been in, even though the role calls for something completely different. Like some actual acting.<br />If, for some reason, you think Andrew McCarthy is really charming and witty, you'll probably like this movie. But for anyone else, avoid it like Sorority Boys 2.
B000001ES4|5.0|OK, this album isn't heaven but it sure comes close.<br />Ever since I became a listener of new age music I heard that Secret Garden was an excellent choice to start with (next to everything by Enya) but for some reason an interest for them never sparked in me, even after all the praise-worthy reviews I read. That is until I heard the elevating \\"Steps\\" come on as I listened to an internet radio station. It just took my breath away and captivated me like very few songs can do. Then I heard the gorgeous \\"Poeme\\" and melted as I listened to the violin and the piano play out a haunting melody. Even after that it still took me awhile to buy anything by them but once I saw the CD on sale ... at my music club I just couldn't pass up such an amazing deal so I bought it, and boy am I ever glad that I did. This has got to be one of the most spiritually exhilerating albums ever to grace the music industry. If you ever just want to get away from all the mainstream pop polluting the airwaves than put this on and let its magic do the rest. This CD just stirs the soul like no other can. It's truly that pure and beautiful. Fionnuala Sherry (who plays the violin) and Rolf Lovland (who plays the piano and keyboards) are a match made in heaven when it comes to composing music. Davy Spillane and John Tate even contribute to the beauty of this album with low whistles and uilleann pipes which spring up now and then to give the atmoshpere a slightly celtic feel. Other favorites, however, include \\"Moving\\", which sounds a little more upbeat and dancy than the others, along with \\"Escape\\" which allows me to release my soul and give my all on whatever I'm doing. So in closing WOW is pretty much all I have to say. This album's incredible so I highly recommend that you buy it. This is my only CD by them but I plan on buying all of their other albums in the years to come.<br />This is highly recommended.
B000062TU1|5.0|When Roger Ebert said this was the Wizard of Oz of today I thought he was crazy. Now that I have seen the movie I couldn't agree more. I haven't read any of the books so the movie was completely new to me. Watching this film was a complete and total joy. The storyline is genius, the setting is magical, the actors do a great job and the special effects are pleasing to the eye. I can't wait for the sequel. I now understand why the books are so popular.
0684803356|3.0|For Whom the Bell Tolls, is equally very engaging and very dull.  Occasionally this novel cracks with energy, the tension among the characters is quite potent, and then at other times it bores you near sleep.  The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo's once fervent commitment to the cause) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts.  All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work, but I can't give it more than 3 stars, because of the chores it sometimes put me through.
0800141601|4.0|Very good <BR>Good artists, good story<BR>Is a fine movie for a saturday afternoon.<BR>Thanks
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne's first hit &quot;Complicated&quot; has been steadily climbing charts and billboards since it was released. This 17 year old Canadian is a complete package and an awesome one at that. Amazingly strong vocals filled with passion and lyrics to match, that you can really relate to. An attitude to fit her catchy guitar playing (which she learned on her own). Anyone who enjoys music would find this album (Let Go) thuroughly satisfying, it's nearly spiritual and can match any mood. I have already purchased her CD and plan on buying another, just so I can have one at home and one for in the car because I'm never without it.
B000065U1N|5.0|I've read some people complaining about the clarity and overall movement of the film, but what needs to be understood is that confusion was inevitable and was supposed to be seen throughout the movie.  War and combat is in itself confusing much of the time, and seeing as how this movie portrays nothing more than historically correct events, it just goes to show the horrors of combat those men went through.  It was said but by General Garrison in the movie,&quot;we just lost the iniative.&quot;  That mission was to take no longer than 30 minutes, but over 12 hours later it still wasnt done.  I believe Ridley Scott recognized this, and through directing techniques, he depicted what those soldiers went through and what everyone saw on CNN, confusion.  Sometimes it takes crafty measures to get across the theme of an event such as the conflict in Somalia.  Confusion was a device used to add depth to the film and give you the same frustration and confusion felt by the Army Rangers and Delta Force men.  Overall, it was a well protrayed and excellent film.
078322933X|4.0|Marky Mark is one bad dude!  In middle school my little sister loved this guy, and blared \\"Good Vibrations\\" until I wanted to scream!  I never thought \\"Marky Mark\\" Whalberg would be such a good actor.<br />I went to see this flick in the theatre and was very surprised at how much I liked it.  I've since gotten the DVD and probably watched it 10 times.<br />Typical story - girl falls for older guy, he gets possesive, starts stalking her, etc.  I don't know how this movie is so damn good but it is.  It's kinda a thriller, and a couple scenes make you jump, but it's nothing mind blowing.<br />So zero out of all people will find this review helpful.  Ok, all I can say is that this is a great movie!  At least rent it and check it out!
B000066NW0|5.0|I think that every teenager should own Avril's cd.  I believe that everyone can relate to her song's.  My parents are always trying to change the way I look and who I am.  I've always thought about maybe taking their advice and being preppy for awhile, but that's when I heard &quot;Complicated&quot;.  That song changed my life in a way.  I got hate from home and school just cause I was being who I really was.  I actually got the lyrics to &quot;Complicated&quot; and had a few friends help me print out enough copies to put in a bunch of lockers and hang up around school.  So if you have a hard life pop in &quot;Let Go&quot; and your day will just brighten up!
B00003CX5P|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two Star War movies and suffered through the third with the little folks in the koala bear suits, I didn't expect much from the fourth and received even less than I had hoped for.<br />How could Lucas have gone so badly wrong?  No director in his right mind would attempt to interleave multiple unrelated action scenes:  meanwhile back at the ranch, back to the other ranch, back to another ranch, back to the first ranch, etc., and hope that any of them would have dramatic impact. The scenes with Anakin's mother were painfully poorly edited; you or anyone else could do better.  They were pathetic examples of the film-makers art.<br />This pathetic excuse for a movie seems to me to be a product of putting the cart before the horse. Instead of special effects supporting a story line about people and their interactions, human actors instead fill in the blanks between special effects.  The result was uninteresting, threadbare and worst of all, childish and amateurish. Human actors were an inconvenient component in a super-animation movie.  If technology could have allowed Lucas to replace them altogether with computer generated imagery, he would have dispensed with them entirely. The film is a Saturday morning cartoon.<br />This was the first of more than one sad ending to a fantastic movie trilogy.
B00003CXI1|5.0|A great movie for escaping from the drudgery and monotany of daily life.
0792844882|5.0|Showgirls is a modern film masterpiece, it is a movie of such grace and beauty that at times it is an overwhelming viewing experience, truly one tends to get wrapped up in its intricate plot and complex characterizations.  Elizabeth Berkeley delivers a nuanced performance of such subtlety that the viewer is left deeply moved, she is an actor we can expect to hear more from in the future, in fact the only complaint I have with her acting is that it is so naturalistic and compelling that it tends to overshadow the film's other touching performances which includes a turn by Kyle MacLachlan that reveals his raw talent, it is a role which only an actor of his stature could handle, the scenes he shares with Elizabeth Berkeley are among the greatest in recent film history, this is a film that really delivers and will set the bar higher than ever for honest human relationships depicted on film, I think it is safe to say this is the best film of the decade, maybe of the century.  Buy this and watch it with an open mind, but make sure you have plenty of tissues because it is a tear-jerker if there ever was one.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Very interesting, a kind of nice escape.  One of Williams's best.
B000066796|1.0|This movie has no point whatsoever! This is THE worst movie ever. Once again Meg Ryan is in a horrible movie (Proof Of Life was also horrid) or maybe it's her..... <BR>1 star
B00002MZ2C|5.0|...well, not really, but if I had heard the searing sounds of the original, and as yet unchallenged, rap-metal band a couple years before I started to get really interested in politics, they very well could-have.  Like it or not, Rage Against the Machine IS politics.  They make Ralph Nader look like Benito Mussolini.  If you're wearing a &quot;United We Stand&quot; T-Shirt right now, you should probably look elsewhere, but if you feel that the United States is a plutocracy run by whitey pigs, Rage's lyrics(if you can make out the words) will speak to you.<br />A combination of metal, hip-hop, and even jazz, Rage's music really cannot be defined by a single genre.  Their music transcends classification.  Vocalist Zach De La Rocha has proven that he's adept at both rapping and wailing and Guitarist Tom Morello's rifts, while at first glance seem pure Jimmy Page rock, evolve into plunging hip-hop rhythm.

B000065V1V|4.0|I've been a fan of Bowie's for well over thirty years and he almost always surprises.  This collection is standard Bowie fare with not much really new - that's not to say it's not great, but I was hoping for a big departure.<br />&quot;Slow Burn&quot; and &quot;Cactus&quot; (the latter being written by Frank Black) will make for great singles.  But, the highlights really start to glow on the last five songs.  His vocals seem to sound weary, as if it were the last take of the day - no stretching of the vocal chords here.<br />&quot;I Took A Trip On A Gemini Spaceship&quot; is a wondrous goof on &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and &quot;Everyone Says 'Hi'&quot; begs the listener to wonder 'what made them go away?'  It's hilarious.  &quot;Better Future&quot; and Heathen&quot; are good old rock and roll songs, but Bowie is just putting out his regular good stuff.<br />The packaging is somewhat of a dissapointment, in that the lyrics are so tiny and presented in 'strikeout' that they are illegible.  That's okay, as Bowie has referenced these lyrics to being suitable for post &quot;9/11&quot; dreadfullness, even though he wrote them before that time.  I'm not sure if that is such clever marketing.  Americans don't need to be reminded of that horror when listening to escapist music, however innocuous.<br />The &quot;CD EXTRA&quot; is just one way to get to Bowie's marketing site.  It's worth a look, especially for the upcoming double &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; reissue.  Bowie may be a chameleon with great artistic talents, but he is also a good marketeer.  Fans will scoop that stuff up!  And that cover photo - oooohh!  Scary!
B00005MM01|1.0|I first started listening to the second half (FOR LITTLE ONES)in the late sixties and haven't heard it 25 yrs.<BR>I am nuts about this section of this double album.<BR>Donovan is so descriptive that I can see what he writes of.  They conjure up images and make me think.  I've never gotten tired of these songs.  they are truly timeless. The words are excellently chosen.  I am familiar with the first song of the first section of this double album (WEAR YOUR LOVE LIKE HEAVEN) i like it because of the colours he paints and the nice thoughts he evokes.  I have not listened to the rest of the first section much cause i can't get enough of the 2nd section.  I'm gonna buy one for my bro' who turned me on to FOR LITTLE ONES in '68.  I wore out two albums.  Sincerely, Lou.
B00005RDRO|5.0|Another masterpiece from Neil Simon. Perfect in humor, suspense, and subtleness. 10 stars out of 5!
0395177111|5.0|This is one of the most wonderfully developed stories that i have ever read.  It has great humor and an incredible theme: anyone can make a difference if they put their mind to it. A lovely book for all ages and all readers.
B000003C5C|4.0|\\"Leprosy\\" is early American death metal, meaning basically that it's extreme thrash with deeper, scarier vocals. While not as technical or diverse as subsequent Death efforts, \\"Leprosy\\" makes up for these shortcomings with its bludgeoning heaviness. The album varies in tempo from kind of fast to really fast, never sacrificing its intensity even during instrumental interludes. The production is rather raw, fitting for the type of music being played. The riffing is downtuned and heavy as hell and the leads shred; Schuldiner and Rozz were an excellent guitar combo. In the background, the drums smack relentlessly and the bass is lower than low. And of course, who can forget Chuck Schuldiner's vocals? His guttural voice, half-scream and half-growl, perfectly matched the overall \\"sick\\" sound of the album. I can't quite justify giving this album five stars, as every song is basically the same, but it's still more like four and a half stars. It's too bad about Chuck's premature demise. His talents will be missed, even by new fans like myself.
0930289528|5.0|One of the greatet graphic novels written.  This isn't just a compilation of comic books and it isn't a takeoff on super hero comics but it is a true novel.  Allen Moore understands the potential power of combining words and pictures to create a new form of literature.  The scene where V stands below Madam Justice and talks about how she changed from an object of his affections to &quot;Liar! ...Deny that you let him have his way with you, him with his arm-bands and jack boots!&quot;  And so, in frustration with the oppression of jack booted justice he has turned to Anarchy (are you listening John Ashcroft?) is worth the purchase price alone.<br />If you want to see where comics become graphic novels get this book!
0679601686|5.0|Jane Austen's writing is superb without a doubt and can by no means get any better. This is a classic story of (stating the obvious) pride and prejudice. I was in agony over whether Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy were really going to get together and it's a story that cannot be told, but must be read to understand it thoroughly. I could read it a million times and I cannot stress it enough for you to buy this book.
B00000DCH9|2.0|I bought this cd soley for the title song, Piano Man, which I think is absolutely fantastic. However, I was very disapointed with the rest of this cd. I've listened to it a hundred times, but I just can't get into any of the songs except Piano Man. I wasn't impressed by the rest of the selection.
0140185232|5.0|i fell in love with larry early on in this book.  it was his sincerity, i think, that did me in.  after having watched the movie version of this book and finding bill murray's larry only slightly likable, i was surprised to be so fully engaged in the book.  and surpised to see that the larry maugham wrote was the same character that bill murray played, only i could see something in him that i missed on the screeen.<br />in the movie, i sympathized with isabel's character in the beginning.  but the book had me seeing a new side of her as well.  her blatant naivete frustrated my reading, and i couldn't begin to understand how she could reason the way she did.  <br />this is a beautiful book.  i was drawn into the story by the delightful beginning, where maugham sets out his intentions for telling the story.  i find it so endearing when authors let the reader in on what feels like secrets of the story.  it builds an intimate tone into the book that never fails to enchant me.  <br />let yourself fall in love with larry's sincere curiosity.  let yourself be frustrated by isabel's unending snobbishness.  and all the other aspects of the book that maugham has carefully placed throughout to engage his readers.
B00005JKED|1.0|Training Day is mildly interesting in its previews and sets you up expecting a clever and scintillating day with a crooked cop.  The only thing it truly succeeds at is pulling every cliche out of bad cop film history and throwing it out without even a scintilla of wit.  The film is formulaic and very woman-hating from start to finish.  Something more interesting to see would be Mamet's Heist.
B00005YXZH|4.0|Just a few months before the release of the world-recognized Yankee Foxtrot Hotel, Jeff Tweedy (Wilco frontman) and his incomplete band (Jay Bennett resigning after the recording of the album)toured the Midwest with an album that was complete, yet lacking a release date.  The album, deemed &quot;commercially unsuccessful&quot; by the Wilco's former record company (Reprise Records) was left unapproved for release.  Despite this seemingly crushing blow, Tweedy remained unphased.  He simply released a streaming version of the new songs on the band's official website until the band could find another record company.  On April 23, 2002, Wilco released the album under the Nonesuch Records label, moving Wilco to the forefront of the music world.  Yankee Foxtrot Hotel takes the alternative country aspect of Being There and merges it with the pop-flavored feel of Summerteeth to create an explosive album.  Tweedy melodies are stronger than ever in songs like &quot;I'm Trying to Break Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Jesus, etc,&quot; while  &quot;Kamera,&quot; &quot;Heavy Metal Drummer,&quot; and &quot;I'm the Man Who Loves You&quot; explore the region where pop overtakes country.  My only criticism lies in the production of the album.  Wilco has always been known for its simple chord progressions and smooth, catchy melodies.  In Yankee Foxtrot Hotel, these two elements are present, but bombarded with an overpowering number of production additions that cannot and are not replicated when the songs are played live.  I am not opposed to the experimentation with eerie tones in the background, but when they are so present in a song that it sounds thin without them, the production has taken over the heart of the song. But despite the production technique, Yankee Foxtrot Hotel is certainly one of the finest albums of 2002.
B000060OZJ|5.0|36 years after it's vinyl-release Dylan's masterpiece &quot;Highway 61&quot; has been re-released in a remastered version. Remastered CDs by Bob Dylan are hard to find but definetely necessary because of the poor mastering of almost all of Dylans records so far. This one comes in a nice package (digipack) with a small reproduction of the original LP back cover (be sure to bring your glasses for that because it's really small). Because this record is really classic there's no need to comment on the music. This release is worth the unusual high price because of it's better quality.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell's Blue provides relief from our modern era of overproduced and uninspired music.  The majority of her critically recognized album is just her and a few guitars (James Taylor/Stephen Still guest), or Joni and a piano.  Her melodies are packed with her characteristic vocal embellishments, which express depth in her singing.  Joni Mitchell's vocal style and songwriting techniques have clearly influenced the work of Tori Amos, Adam Duritz (Counting Crows), and many other contempory musicians.  In fact, Adam Duritz has listed Blue as one of his three favorite albums.  How does Joni Mitchell capture an audience of famous musicians?  The answer lies in her daringly honest lyrics.  Even though Mitchell's songs are about specific situations relevant to her life, we are able to absorb a range of emotions in her writing.  Mitchell writes \\"Little Green\\" about a child being given up for adoption.  With rich emotion in her voice, she warns \\"Just a little green/Like the nights when the Northern lights perform/There'll be icicles and birthday clothes/And sometimes there'll be sorrow.\\"  Songs like \\"My Old Man\\" and \\"California\\" are simply songs about places and events surrounding Mitchell's life.  In contrast, \\"Blue\\" and \\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\" unravel stories with dominating themes about love. Blue truly captures the pinnacle of folk songwriting and is nothing short of a classic.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|There's something odd about a transition from a video game to a movie, and whereas it is often compared to comic book characters one would assume (after seeing this movie) it is much more difficult to carry off convincingly. Angeline Jolie is sultry, sexy and certainly focuses your attention, but the plot is thin, predictable and very silly in places. In trying to add suspense to a weak script the viewer is left with a comic depiction. The movie never intends to take itself seriuosly, and shouldn't considering that upon which it is based, but what starts out with such promise, ends in a contrived mess. One for a rainy day only

The songs on it like the title track are pretty good.<BR>The second song is pretty good too. and so is the third one,<BR>Come to think of it, they're all pretty good songs, especially the last three. Gosh, where does the time go? Then he dares tamper with Dylan so probably lost a star there but you know.

6305041156|5.0|&quot;Ran&quot; (Chaos) is the greatest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare and a masterpiece in its own right. In adapting the broad scenario of  &quot;King Lear&quot; to a setting in Sixteenth Century Japan, Akira Kurosawa felt free to manipulate it to his own purposes, leading to a film that is perhaps even more bleak than the play. <br />First and foremost &quot;Ran&quot; is a visually stunning film, unencumbered by the received tradition of Shakespearean language, which never translates well onto the cinema screen, he has allowed the scenario to develop into images that are beautiful and horrific. Filmed on the slopes of Mount Fuji there is a sense of unreality, or nightmare about the whole epic, as though it is taking place in a mythic space, at once recognisable and alien. For a director best known for his black and white movies (&quot;Seven Samurai&quot;, &quot;Rashomon&quot;), Kurosawa surprisingly uses color to breathtaking virtuoso effect. The scenes of soldiers flooding in waves across the volcanic wasteland of Mount Fuji carrying vivid blue, red or yellow flags are amongst the most extraordinary ever filmed. The battle scenes shock and astonish, not least because Kurosawa's use of sound is so exquisite and original; many of the most horrendous images of battle are shown without sound effects with only an elegiac musical accompaniment. Far from sanitising them, the effect is to shock you out of the viewing habits formed watching so many other \\"war\\" movies. <br />Yet &quot;Ran&quot; is so much more than a broad epic, or war movie. The more intimate scenes are carried off with understated conviction, the sly hypocrisy hidden behind formality and convention is conveyed in highly poised and stylised interior shots. This film can be both visceral (prepare yourself for the beheading of Lady Kaede: as visually explosive as anything by Tarantino, and set within a film that is more than mere surface) and restrained, depending on the nature of the scene. There aremoments of quiet and tenderness that resonate long after the film had ended.<br />It is odd that so few successful films have been made from Shakespeare. The pre-eminent playwright of the western canon has translated beautifully into opera and stage directors can continually find fresh things to say about the plays themselves, yet in general film had been hopelessly incapable of doing anything of note with Shakespeare. Think of the ghastly declamatory rhetoric of Laurence Olivier in &quot;Henry V&quot;, or the inane pop video that Baz Lurmann made from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, not to mention Kenneth Brannagh's tediously self-important &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Somehow Kurosawa succeeds where all these others fail. His earlier &quot;Throne of Blood&quot; was a beautifully realised adaptation of &quot;Macbeth&quot; to the Samurai period in Japan: &quot;Ran&quot; builds on that achievement and surpasses it. Perhaps the fact that Kurosawa was Japanese allowed him more creative license to work with Shakespeare, able to approach it simply as valid material for film making, and not as the shibboleth that it is to western artists.  <br />In Ran we have the late masterpiece of one of the greatest and most important film makers. It is a distilled and precise work, powerful, visceral, contemplative, epic and intimate. In short this is film making on a par with the greatest art. Ran shows us what mainstream film making can achieve, but so rarely does.
0783226063|5.0|I read the Dune novels a long time ago and have been a moderate fan of Frank Herbert since. However I never watched the movie cause I kept hearing and reading it was awful. On a whim I bought it on DVD last year and was very surprised to find a genuinely brilliant movie. It has a sweeping epic feel reminiscent of Lawrence of Arabia but with a lynchian character of its own. If watched with an open mind (and preferably with a projector an a large screen) this movie will reward you. Having watched the recent awfully childish, stupid and very boring TV series adapted from Dune makes me appreciate this movie even more.
B00004XMTH|5.0|I first met these fabulous felines about 4 years ago, via the video.  I have about six copies of the video and two of the dvd issue.  That's just in case one machine breaks down so I won't  have to experience withdrawal symptoms.  In short, after all this viewing, I still believe CATS followed by Les Mis, are the greatest musicals of our time.  And, of course, in my opinion the greatest dancer in the video is Victoria. As I said in my review here some years ago.  All of the dancers and singers were fantastic, but she (PCS) remains my fav.  She's now in Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang playing at the Palladium.  I'll get that one too when it comes out on video, especially since Michael Ball, who played Marius in Les Mis, is the main character.  Any opposing opinions may be sent to me at my e-mail address.  CATS the musical brought me some of the finest young friends I've ever been privileged to meet and we've remained friends all these years and hopefully will continue for decades to come.<br />  JellicleFrank
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down is not a movie with a storyline, plot, or any real character development, for that matter.  This I'll admit.  The part of the movie that makes it so powerful is Ridley Scott's amazing recreations of battle sequences.  I'd have no idea how close these recreations were to the truth, but the point is made blisteringly clear to the audience, these soldiers were put through hell.  It's a difficult movie to go back and watch twice, as some of the scenes will leave even the strongest of men holding back tears.  Highly recommended, for those that &quot;enjoy&quot; war movies this one simply can't be missed.
B000063S6Z|5.0|His music is the best. I recently got off his boards on his website .... I think its great. Moby, maybe I am trying to hard to get your attention. I just read your journal and you looked ... to check a review on your CD. Anyways I guess I dont know what I'd do if I got Moby's attention. I love the music though. Best album and best singer (in my oppinion anyway).
B000063S6Z|5.0|I just have to say that this is a great CD. I have it in my CD player and am just listening to it over and over and over again... Both fans of Moby and people who have never heard of him will like this. I especially like The Great Escape. Good Song....
0312265859|5.0|The book is just a bit different from previous Stephanie Plum novels.  Stephanie has just moved a bit into the darker side (but so has Spielberg in Minority Report).     <br />Stephanie Plum fans will enjoy the book, still has the humor and the fun characters you've come to know and love.<br />New readers looking for mystery will enjoy the story and should appreciate the humor which is far different than any other mystery writer.<br />If you are looking for humor and romance with a touch of mystery in the background....read one of the other seven Stephanie Plum books first.
038533558X|4.0|After reading Coben's previous novel, Tell No One, I was looking forward to Gone For Good.  This is a complicated mystery with many twists and turns.  Coben's subtle humor is sprinkled throughout and tends to ease the tension somewhat.  Will Klein, our hero, is very believable as a sometimes brave and sometimes clueless guy.  I found the jumping from one scene to another a little disruptive and there were a few noticeable errors.  On two different occasions, a character would sit down, then a few lines later, would sit again.  This story wasn't quite as good as Tell No One, but it was still a very good read.  If you can follow the many twists and turns, you will be rewarded with a snap-crackling good conclusion.
B00002DEIX|5.0|I have to say that this is my favorite cd in my collection i got a year a go and its still entertaining.  I 99% sure anyone who buys this cd will enjoy it.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This DVD is what every other DVD should be. Over 6 hours of extra footage, three versions of the movie, and cool looking menus to top it all off. This is a must own for anyone with a DVD player. Of the three versions of the movie, the hidden version is by far the best. It includes every piece of cut footage from the movie. Granted, it adds to the length of the movie quite a bit, but it defineately gives the movie a new life. Hopefully, more studios will notice the detail in this DVD and follow its example.
630512762X|5.0|Two men know each other more than they know anybody else. What's the connection? One's been tracking the other down for years. One's been running away from the other. Sean Archer (John Travolta) loses his son to the sick Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) and only wants to catch the killer. After a huge battle on a runway with people rolling out of planes, Troy has finally been caught. A secret experiment enabled Archer to remove Troy's face and put it on his. He would become him to find out where Troy's hidden bomb is at. \\"Peaches, I could eat a peach for hours.\\" From high Travolta voice to low Cage voice. It was memorable. Wait, Troy came back to life without a face and took Archer's, so he became him. Does this make any sense? The two live each other's lives and start to like it. Joan Allen plays Archer's wife and Gina Gershon plays Troy's girlfriend. What casting. There are funny action scenes with people falling through windows and Archer as Troy jumping off a huge prison roof. John Woo the director, always throws in the traditional scream of death in his movies and it's always funny. The movie is original. Who would seriously cut off a person's face to become him. I recall \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" where Leatherface ate people's faces. Hopefully you don't remember that. The grostesque images reminded me of cold spaghetti. Anyway, the movie is fast and touching at times. Good performances.
B000002LND|5.0|Not a word is inncorrect. Madonna is the biggest pop star to ever roam the face of the earth (Elvis, Beatles etc...aren't POP stars). She's sold 160,000,000 albums; more than any other female artist in the history of the music charts, had 10 UK No.1s singles and 7 UK No.1 albums - more than twice the amount of any other female artist in chart history, a staggering 615,000,000 in the kitty, a worldwide fanbase estimated at 450,000,000 and more Top 10 UK singles than Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Kylie Minogue, Cher, Aretha Franklin, Diana Ross, Britney Spears, Tina Turner and Janet Jackson. She is the Queen of Pop, she is a legendary icon...she is Madonna. The Immacualte Collection is Madonna's biggest selling album (22,000,000 shifted since November 1st 1990). It features an array of hit singles from 1983 - 1990 and features 5 UK No.1 singles. It kicks of with the ultimate dance singles of 1983 and 1984; Holiday (UK No.6) and Lucky Star (UK No.14). We then move onto Borderline (UK No.53). All three singles were taken from Madonna's debut album, Madonna (1983, UK No.37) which has managed to sell 8,000,000 since 1983. Madonna wasn't really well known at this stage...but all that was to change with the release of her second album Like A Virgin (1984,UK No.1). Track 4 on The Immacualte Collection is Like A Virgin (UK No.3) in which the foxy, little minx prances aroung Venice on a gondola and Track 5 is Material Girl (UK No.3) in which she re-inacts a scene from Marilyn Monroe's classic film, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes. The Like A Virgin album sold 20,000,000 and made Madonna a worldwide pop phenomenon. Crazy For You (UK No.2) follows Material Girl. It was taken from the film, Vision Quest. The soundtrack however, became more memorable than the film itself!!! It features on no Madonna albums. Into The Groove (UK No.1) was Madonna's first UK No.1. It was taken from the film Desperately Seeking Susan in which she starred. The highly-anticipated release of Madonna's third album, True Blue (1986, UK No.1) featured some of Madonna's best known classics such as Live To Tell (UK No.2), Papa Don't Preach (UK No.1), Open Your Heart (UK No.4) and La Isla Bonita (UK No.1). True Blue has sold 19,000,000 to date. Madonna took most of 1988 off to record her fourth studio album, Like A Prayer (1989, UK No.1). Up until now, the critics were always quick to dismiss Madonna as a \\"one-hit-wonder\\". They were proved wrong with the release of the single, Like A Prayer (UK No.1). It is considered Madonna's greatest single and ranked 4th in the 100 Greatest No.1 Singles of All Time. Madonna signed a $5 million deal with Pepsi to do an advert that had to feature clips from the Like A Prayer video. It was the day before the premiere of the video when Madonna said to Pepsi bosses, \\"you have seen the video, haven't you?\\" \\"No,why\\" replied the bosses. \\"Oh, you'll see!\\" she said. The next day, they did see...and a lot more than they wanted to!!! Madonna dancing in front of buring crosses and embracing with a black Jesus forced Pepsi to pull the advert. All hell broke loose when religious rights groups condemned Madonna - as did the Vatican!!! - who banned Madonna from ever entering Italy!!! Madonna got to keep the $5 million on which she spent on paintings by her favourite artist, Frida Kahlo!!! The controversy helped the album sell 13,000,000 and kick-started the mammoth 1990 Blonde Ambition World Tour in which she performed to more than 4,000,000 hardcore fans. Express Yourself (UK No.5) and Cherish (UK No.3) follow Like A Prayer on The Immacualte Collection. In April 1990, Madonna released Vogue (UK No.1). It remains her biggest single in the UK to date. Justify My Love (UK No.2) and Rescue Me (UK No.3) close The Immacualte Collection. The controversial, sexy, 18+ video to Justify My Love kick-started years of sexual antics from Madonna which included the album Erotica, the smash-hit book Sex, and the 1993 Girle Show Live Tour in which you HAD to be 15 to attend it...I got in and I was 13!!! Every CD collection in the world needs The Immacualte Collection. From the early dance days of Holiday and Lucky Star, to the platinum blonde Papa Don't Preach and Open Your Heart, to the controverisal Like A Prayer and the catwalk Vogue to the sex-packed Justify My Love, there is definitley something for everyone. Other Madonna albums I highly recommend are Ray of Light (1998, UK No.1), Music (2000, UK No.1), Erotica (1992, UK No.2), Like A Prayer (1989, UK No.1), Like A Virgin (1984,UK No.1) and Bedtime Stories (1994,UK No.2). These six albums have sold 70,000,000 between them!!!! <BR>(I'm sorry if my incredibly vast knowledge on THE ultimate diva get's you frustrated, but it's been building up for so long, I just had to tell someone...what a better way than to start with the U.K!!!)
0805209999|5.0|I giving the book 5 stars, because it's a really good read. Not having read any other translation, I must take other reviewer's word that it compares well. Read the other reviews, they are correct about this books quality.<br />Now, here's why I am mad. I read the introduction. Then I read the translator's notes. The translator is quite full of himself and his cleverness. Thus he points out the sections where he was particularly clever. In doing so, he gives away the plot, the ending of the novel, and why we should think about it the way he translated it, and not trust earlier transactions.<br />This should have been an afterward, not before the text. I reviewed the plot, including the ending, before reading the text. This somewhat ruined the experience for me. Skip the translator's notes, and you'll have a fine edition of Kafka's influntial novel.
B000003C2U|5.0|The late-Chuck Schuldiner's abilities as a death vocalist and guitar shredder cannot be doubted. The man was downright talented. Nevertheless, it's his lyrics, notably on this album, which stand out. This is thinking man's metal at its peak. I only wish I had seen these guys live when Chuck was still around. It seems every Death album is a masterpiece, and \\"Human\\" is no exception.
B00006690H|4.0|The record is flat-out AwEsOmE!! He just can't stop putting out hits. Til I Collapse has to be to best track on the album featuring Nate Dogg. If you don't have this, you need to buy this Now!!
B00005YW4H|3.0|This is a well-produced album, and Norah Jones is a decent singer-pianist.  But all the acclaim she is getting is somewhat unjustified.  Jones' voice is OK, but not great.  It has an annoying tone to it, though she does well with &quot;Cold Cold Heart.&quot;  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the recordings of Eva Cassidy and Diana Krall too much, and it may not be fair to compare her to those two.  Nevertheless, she doesn't come close to measuring up.  Perhaps her voice will become more palatable as she gets older, but for now, it doesn't cut the mustard.  For all the promotional clout and recognition this album is getting, I expected better, that's all.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Like some other listeners, I was also waiting for this album a long time, but I was not disappointed. I thought Moby retained all the good aspects of his album Play, the classical and jazz influences and the mix of voices that made the album unique; however, 18 doesn't have the same disjointed feeling between tracks that Play did, and is a better album for it. For people who enjoyed Play, the tracks Porcelain, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?, and Down Low are similar in sound and ambience to the tracks on 18. The tracks are mostly solem rather than upbeat, but overall is very pleasant to drive or work to. <BR>Essentially, the album is full of beautiful piano and voices, strong melodies and consistent character. Definately recommendable.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Some of the best live musicianship you'll ever hear.  John Petrucci's solos in &quot;Through Her Eyes&quot; are, well, beyond mind-blowing.  Oh man...I'm at a loss for words.  Great stuff, damn near perfect!
B0000640VN|4.0|It's not as if this kind of movie has not been done before, but the two lead actors, Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman, are truly charming in it.  Ryan plays a fast-rising corporate star, while Jackman is a man transported from the 1800's to the 2000's through no fault of his own.  Actually he is brought to the present by Ryan's ex-boyfriend, played wonderfully by Leiv Schreiber.  The plot is predictable, but if you enjoy light, romantic comedy, this movie's for you!
B00000AFWW|4.0|I'm a huge Hole fan, so of course, I believe that this CD is great.  This isn't my favorite Hole CD, but I still do enjoy it.  It's a lot softer than the other Hole CD's, but it is still good. My favorite songs are \\"Northern Star,\\" \\"Dying,\\" \\"Reasons to be Beautiful,\\" and \\"Hit So Hard.\\"<br />I like all of the songs on this album, but if you are into harder rock, then this probably isn't the best CD to get.  Hole rocks hard on this CD, but it is not as hard as their previous CD's.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna gives &quot;Ray of Light&quot; producer, William Orbit, a break and puts newcomer Mirwais Ahmadzai to work on a less spiritual yet funkier and sometimes downhome record. <br />&quot;Music&quot; is a retro-dance celebration anthem and an automatic #1 hit. It is followed by the full-fledged, rave-inspired, glorious insanity of &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;. Orbit works on two tracks: &quot;Amazing&quot; which is &quot;Beautiful Stranger&quot; taken up a notch and &quot;Runaway Lover&quot;, which has thoughtful lyrics that are awkwardly backed by unintentionally dull electronica. Acoustic guitar is showcased on the mellow and reflective &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, a dedication to her husband, and on the upbeat, radio-friendly &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;. Two of the best songs are &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; and &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot;; both are dark and features the computer-altered voice of Madonna, whose singing comes off as touching despite the gloomy subject matter. <br />The less impressive songs are &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;, but the rest of the album contributes to one of the best albums in Madonna's career as well as the year 2000.
B000000JO3|5.0|...listening to this album over 11 years after I first came in contact with it. This IS the definitive early '80s punk soundtrack. If you are interested in the real deal hardcore of that era, this is your ticket. The cover alone warrants a listen.
B0000027RL|3.0|DISCLAIMER: AN AVID PEARL JAM FAN THAT OWNS ALL THEIR STUDIO ALBUMS, &quot;LIVE ON TWO LEGS&quot;, THREE BOOTLEGS, AND A COUPLE SINGLES.<br />First of all, I would like to say that all Pearl Jam albums are five stars+ when compared to most modern music- I'm evaluating them by comparing them to all their other albums.  That out of the way, &quot;Ten&quot; is not their best album, as most people say it is.  Yes, it was their first, it had their biggest hits, and it sold over eight million copies in the US alone.  However, the band hadn't yet begun to develop their music, and some of these songs feel overly simple.  Another problem is that the album feels dated (as said earlier, not necessarily a bad thing), especially compared to how well albums like Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Alice in Chains' &quot;Dirt&quot; hold up to modern ears.  The production is among the sloppiest of Pearl Jam's albums (this was made before the great Brendan O'Brian came along), and on some songs the bass and drum backup seems weak.<br />Now that all the negative's been said, this is still a great album.  Teenage angst powers most of the songs, while the heartbreak of a failed relationship drives the emotional &quot;Black&quot; (doo-doo-doo, for non-Pearl Jam fans).  Some rockers succeed better than others- &quot;Porch&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; are highlights, while &quot;Deep&quot; is somewhat weak.  &quot;Oceans&quot; is not one of their great ballads, but it's a pretty little song.  One of the best songs is the semi-rocker &quot;Garden&quot;, which is powered by a good solo.  I don't think I need to say anything about the radio staples &quot;Even Flow&quot; and &quot;Jeremy&quot;, as people hear them all the time.  I must say that I love the &quot;Jeremy&quot; video.  Surprisingly, the album's best song is its soft closer &quot;Release&quot;- this is a toned down Pearl Jam at their best, and it goes great as a live opener.<br />Overall, this is a great album and technically PearlJam's only &quot;classic&quot;, but it's not without flaws and is not their best album.  If you're already a Pearl Jam fan, what I say means little to you.  If you're trying Pearl Jam out, buy this album or &quot;Yield&quot; first to get a good feel of the band.  If you're an ignorant person raised on Limp Bizkit, Eminem, and Britney Spears, try Pearl Jam out immediately.<br />Note: If you liked the way I set up this review, I plan on posting one for all their studio albums.  If you didn't, then you can just ignore me :)
B000002AGN|5.0|wow, my first HDCD, makes you really wonder why the shops don't advertize with HDCD's amazing!!!!!<BR>this classic recording that used to sound so great on vinyl sound incredible with the hdcd technology .... try this if the cd industry has dissappointed you so far, finally something that sounds real, Why they don't make more of these HDCD's !!!!!! try it. and enjoy the music.
B0000028UK|4.0|WARNING: AVID PEARL JAM FAN WHO OWNS ALL THEIR STUDIO ALBUMS, &quot;LIVE ON TWO LEGS&quot;, THREE BOOTLEGS, AND A COUPLE SINGLES.<br />Pearl Jam's energetic follow-up to &quot;Ten&quot; fixes a lot of problems that plagued that album- the production's much better (courtesy of Brendan O' Brian), and the bass and drum backup has been greatly improved.  However, one thing that is wrong with this album that is even worse than it was on &quot;Ten&quot; is how dated some of the songs feel.  This is evident in the middle section of the album (Tracks 4-7).  It's not that these aren't good songs- they just would not hold up well with modern radio (not that Pearl Jam cares about being radio friendly, but you know what I'm getting at).  Also, as with &quot;Ten&quot;, the band wasn't finished developing- many of the songs still have overly simple formulas, and there's little experimenting.<br />Of course, this is still a great album.  It's probably Pearl Jam's most consistent effort (constant rocking with occasional slowing down).  It begins with two power rockers- &quot;Go&quot; is furious rock that needs to be head-banged to (as other reviewers have noted), and &quot;Animal&quot; is a great sing-along anthem live.  Despite this quick start, many of the album's weak spots ironically come from the rockers.  &quot;Blood&quot; sounds like an 80's hard rocker would if it was grunge-soaked, despite good vocals by Eddie Vedder on that song.  &quot;Rats&quot; sounds too contrived and pessimistic.  Nevertheless, most of the rest of the album is terrific.  The politically charged songs (&quot;Glorified G&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, and &quot;White Male American&quot;) are brilliant.  The ballads are among Pearl Jam's best, as they range from uplifting (&quot;Daughter&quot;) to hopeless (&quot;Indifference&quot;).  The album's best song is &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;, which is about a failed relationship- in fact, this is one of the best hard rock songs ever written.<br />Overall, thealbum is a definite improvement over &quot;Ten&quot;, and it began to show the band as developing towards greatness.  A masterpiece followed this album- it can be seen as a prelude.  This should be one of the first Pearl Jam albums you buy (buy &quot;Ten&quot; or &quot;Yield&quot; first and see if the band interests you).
B00005JKED|4.0|Shocking. This is one of the first things that come to mind when I think of Training Day. I bought it because of Denzel getting the Academy Award. I don't think any preview can prepare you for this movie. Denzel plays a nacotics cop who heads a squad who plays both sides of the street. And what a street it is. Gang bangers, drug dealers, poverty all rear their ugly head here.<br />This movie takes place over the span of one day and tells the story of a young officer played by Ethan Hawke riding with Denzel for the first time as a new member of this narcotics unit. Hawke's character sees being in this elite unit as a way to make it higher up into the Department on the way to detective. But he has no idea that Denzel and his unit have their own set of rules, many contrary to the Law and he must choose to stay with his moral duty to uphold the Law or give it up to join Denzel and advance his career.<br />This movie shows the way the streets are on the \\"other side of the tracks\\". My wife told me she never wanted to go to LA after seeing it. I don't know how truthful the protrait of Denzel's character is but you would think there has to be some truth to it with all that power in their hands and all the drug money they are dealing with. It will make you think the next time you see a story of a narcotics bust and hear how much money was found. You'll wonder if that was 100% of the funds or if there was some skimming going on.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|\\"Requiem for a Dream\\" is just what it says it is: a song mourning the death of a dream. Or four. The film is a powerful masterpiece that draws forth emotions from the depths of our souls in a way that no other movie has. It is honest, brutally honest, and speaks to us all. We can identify with desiring something. We can all identify with losing what we desire. We can all identify with not seeing our dreams come true. Too many simple-minded people have classified it as a movie about drugs. While one of the messages is \\"Don't do drugs\\", there is a lot more to it than that. \\"Requiem\\" is about the death of dreams. It's about obsession. Addiction in general. It's about the slow numbing of the soul and mind. By the end of the film, all four characters are still alive...but they are dead as well. \\"Requiem\\" is about humanity and the struggles, hypocracies, darkness, and inner, simplistic beauties that make us human.<BR>The soundtrack is perfect for the film. It is stunning, brilliant, intoxicating, maddening...haunting. No other soundtrack has moved me in such a way. It, like the film, brings out raw emotional energy that we, for the most part, are terrified of. Like the movie, the soundtrack is divided into three sections, or movements: Summer, Fall, Winter. <BR>The soundtrack begins with Summer, which is composed of, for the most part, several short song clips that hint of a demon lurking in the dark. It whispers of things to come. It reflects the tragic blindness of the four characters as they pursue their individual ideas of happiness. While they are blind, the audience, or listener in this case, is full aware of the inevitable downfall their lifestyles are spiraling to. It is chilling.<BR>When we reach Fall the soundtrack speaks of impending doom. The illusions are shattered, one by one, and the characters are beginning to lose their grips on reality. They, even now, refuse to believe what is happening to them, refusing to let go of these dreams that are creating for them their nightmares instead.<BR>Winter is when all Hell breaks loose. It is a cold, nightmarish pace that Clint Mansell sets. The music reaches a feverish pitch as their nightmares are unleashed and they wake up to the horror they have created for themselves. It is grim, terrifying, and far too real. The soundtrack reaches a Hellish climax and then is ended by the haunting strings of \\"Lux Aeterna\\", a song that draws all the emotions of the film into one piece. It is topped off by \\"Coney Island Low\\", a track that is simple but justifiable as an ending to this amazing experience that is the \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" soundtrack.<BR>Some pieces feel incomplete and random when listened to in succession, but it is the general order in the film. \\"Winter Overture\\" is very short, but it is as it was in the film. While at times this is can be disappointing and even frustrating, the soundtrack makes up for it with the haunting strings of the Kronos Quartet blended with haunting electronic sounds. Clint Mansell is a genius.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is war and it truly is hell. Outnumbered on the field and backed by the politically driven Defense Department of the time, one battalion finds itself outnumbered and fighting for its life in the jungles of Vietnam.<br /><br />A recent reviewer here mistook what this movie was about. It is NOT about America's war in Vietnam and all the ideology behind it. Its about a battle that occurred in the early years of that war between a new type of specialized fighting unit and a very determined enemy. America wanted to engage the enemy for the first time and this is the battle. The only politics involved here is the decision not to declare a National Emergency thus allowing the Army's most experienced soldiers to leave at the end of their enlistments, when ironically they were most needed. This movie is about a battalion commander training his unit, getting orders and shipping off to war. It also gives an excellent look at what the wives had to endure during that terrible time.<br /><br />If one wants to look at the politics of this war, check out HBO's [[ASIN:B00007M55W Path to War]]. Path to War shows the speech were LBJ sends this unit, the Air Cav, to Vietnam and the political reasoning behind it. It goes through LBJ's escalation and McNamera's change of heart on the winnablity of the war. Highly recommend it.<br /><br />Anyway, in realism this ranks up there with Saving Private Ryan. By reading the book you get a much better grasp of what happened as well as the story not told of what happened at LZ Albany. That encounter was even a worse then what happened at LZ X-Ray.<br /><br />All told this movie gives the feel of how horrible, horrowing and confusing first-hand combat can be. One decision can lead to winning the day, or as the movie shows, getting yourself cut off and most of your men killed. As for accuracy to what occurred, a group of soldiers that were there appeared on The History Channel's \\"Hollywood vs History\\" program and they concurred that it was 75-80% factual. 20 - 25% Hollywood. That's probably a good ratio indeed. Oh, and the little American Flag at the end was real, not Hollywood. And Sam Elliot deserves an Academy Award for his portrait of American Hero Sgt. Major Basil Plumley.od. That's probably a good ratio indeed. Oh, and the little American Flag at the end was real, not Hollywood.

1577311523|5.0|Our millennium is bringing forth a new, collective flowering of consciousness. The old set of consciousness has not yet been broken, and, unfortunately,  it may only be broken by a momentous future catastrophe. Perhaps \\"September 11\\" was the beginning of our awakening.<br />During the latter part of the 19th century, an extraordinary woman, Madame Blavatsky, channeled material which created a great movement of spiritual awareness. Yet, she stated that it would be another hundred years before the secrets she kept would be revealed. Almost to the day, the Course of Miracles was released but never advertised except by word of mouth. It seemed that the Course simplified teachings from almost every imaginable source, but it also presented itself in a form that was non-threatening to the modern Christian-oriented world.<br />Now, new teachers are emerging, and they are helping us with this transformation by presenting these same ideas from Eastern and Western spiritual teachings in a neutral, up-to-date format. Certainly, one of outstanding teachers is a young man, Eckert Tolle, author of \\"The Awakening West,\\" and a new masterpiece, \\"The Power of Now.\\"<br />Our time has come to move from the old image of pain, hatred and war, to the new paradigm of the release of suffering for all humanity. The thoughts have been our sacred treasure for thousands of years from all the great mystics of our planet, but now we are ready to understand what the transformation means for the survival of the human species.
B000002B30|4.0|I have always questioned musicians adding non-hits in Greatest Hits albums. Springsteen's hits and good non-hits are almost endless. Granted this was not an anthology, but he could of at least added some his older well-respected work. His more recent stuff really is too bland and lacks the energy of his work at the end of the 70's<br />I just think he needed to add and subtract some songs to/from this album.
B00000K19E|5.0|It's difficult to review this film without being guilty of quoting a plethora of superlatives.  So were does one start?  Firstly, and I think most significantly, there is more to this movie than meets the eye.  This movie teases the viewer with possible new insights into various philosophical questions facing the human race.  &quot;Oh sure, you don't actually believe this stuff, do you?&quot;  That's not the point really.  What The Matrix does, in addition to giving us an entertainment masterpiece, is nudge our subconscious, and consciously or not, make us pause and think about what this game of life is all about.  How many of us have watched this movie more than once, and just don't get sick of it.  It's engrossing all right, and I'm suggesting it's not just as a result of the entertainment factor.  Well done to the Wachowski brothers.  5 out of 5 on that score. So your not sold on this analysis?  No problem, lets get back to something easier on the mind, superlatives.  Special effects, first rate with some groundbreaking stuff in their.  Stuntwork, simply wicked.  Acting, all round excellence from the cast.  Music score, very appropriate. Script, way out. Action, non stop really and as a bonus the slower scenes are still absorbing. DVD extras, very good. Replayability, unlimited.  If you can only ever afford to buy one DVD title in your life, this is it.
B000007T1M|5.0|Serj, Daron, Shavo, and John...four crazy musicians from California creating a musical revolution of heavy music. It seems tangential to bands such as Rage Against the Machine or Anti-Flag, but serious to say, System of a Down is one crazy metal machine. With a feeling of punk ethics and hardcore riffs, the bands stands for itself to entertain their fans and send out their messages secretly. Their biggest hit &quot;Sugar&quot; comes out to be a neo-jazz riff with outstanding vocals (and with a hilarious chorus). &quot;Spiders&quot; gives the band more depth and comes with a poetic dynamic riff. The essence of SOAD is found in &quot;P.L.U.C.K&quot;, (politically, lying, unholy, cowardly killers). With outstanding vocals, amazing guitar playing, and pounding riffs, System of a Down is one band that can't be ingnored.
B000006U44|5.0|Yes, the cover's different, and that's what prompted me to get this version instead of the standard one.  No bonus tracks or anything, but I liked this cover better.  Well, this is where the story starts for Kate Bush.<br />Kate's vocals are somewhat girlish here but not too discernible.<br />I make that observation in comparing the version of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; here and the new vocal version on The Whole Story.<br />With the haunting and lovely opener &quot;Moving&quot; the lyric &quot;You crush the lily in my soul&quot; shows of what lyricism is capable of from the word go.  Metaphysics and the paranormal are explored in the mid-paced &quot;Strange Phenomena.&quot;<br />The two most upbeat songs here are &quot;Kite&quot; and &quot;James and the Cold Gun.&quot;  &quot;Kite&quot; has the some of the most imaginative imagery and lyrics I've seen.  &quot;There's a hole in the sky with a big eyeball.&quot;  Wow!  And how's this for a rhyming scheme--belly-o with wellios?  She becomes a 2D diamond kite, which is what the Japanese album cover is all about.  There's part of the eyeball, the diamond kite, and her on it.  &quot;James&quot; has a 1920's gangster motif, and to paraphrase, Kate tells the title character that he's losing his humanity and sense of reality by selling his soul to a cold gun.<br />Two of Kate's best realized pieces come back to back--the ballad &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; on a man who is most surely her Prince Charming, and &quot;Wuthering Heights.&quot;  Ballads are her specialty, as she closes the album with with feminine-assertive &quot;Room For The Life&quot; and the title track, which is just Kate, her piano, and some strings.<br />&quot;Feel It,&quot; basically about a quickie in the parlor, has the same eroticism that would kick up a notch higher in Wow's &quot;In The Warm Room.&quot;  &quot;L'Amour Looks Something Like You&quot; also fits into this category, especially when she speaks of her sticky love.  Right, that wouldn't be a Valentine card with too much glue, would it?<br />&quot;Oh To Be In Love&quot; starts out with Kate and her piano, then the mandolin, bass, and drums kick in to its slow rolling beat.  Even the chorus gets stretched into &quot;oh oh oh to be e e in love&quot;<br />This is where the good woman and her piano music started, so Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, and Norah Jones, you'd better recognize!  A classic stunning debut album that really kicked me inside nice and good.that wouldn't be a Valentine card with too much glue, would it?<br />&quot;Oh To Be In Love&quot; starts out with Kate and her piano, then the mandolin, bass, and drums kick in to its slow rolling beat.

B00005UKKF|5.0|This is quite simply the best DVD I have ever purchased.  The sound quality is very good, and the entertainment value is very high along with the replay value.  The final performance of &quot;One More Time&quot; is amazing, and by itself makes this DVD a worthwhile purchase, although the rest of it is very good as well.  The costuming was very well done, and if you don't mind seeing a live performance to a recording this is a great choice.  As with all HBO productions, the camera work is professionally done, and except for a few instances leaves little to be desired.  Even if you don't necessarily like Britney's music, there is still a lot to like about this DVD.  The running time is nearly an hour and a half, so this is a much better value than many other DVD's that run for an hour or sometimes 30 minutes, like &quot;Britney.&quot;
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Paul Rothchild (Doors' producer) came along at just the right time to produce this classic and historic work, which was Janis' last album, released posthumously after her tragic and premature departure from the planet. \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" never ceases to amaz me, especially when she delivers the word \\"nuthin\\" after singing the famous line, \\"freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose.\\" The way she says \\"nuthin\\" is just so flat-out REAL, you know she's speaking to you straight from her bones. (The acoustic demo of this song is available on the 3-CD box set, which sheds light on how Janis single-handedly created the blueprint for this track, just her and her guitar). \\"My Baby\\" is gospel-like and redemptive, and is my favorite song on the \\"Pearl\\" album. It's as though her voice is a gateway into another realm and sends chills thru the body. \\"Cry Baby\\" is also one of Janis' most amazing vocal performances. (I like the alternate version of \\"Cry Baby\\" available on the 3-CD box set even better, because it captures some interesting moments of laughter in the studio, along with a very amusing rap midway thru the song)<br />What many people don't realize about Janis is that she wrote some of her own (and best) material. \\"Move Over\\" is a Janis original and rocks as hard as anything she ever recorded. She sang this song on the Dick Cavett show right before the infamous high school reunion in Port Arthur.<br />She also performed \\"Get It While You Can\\" on the same show, which is as much of an anthem as any song she recorded. The line, \\"we may not be here tomorrow,\\" is all too prophetic. The instrumental track of the ironic \\"Buried Alive in the Blues\\" is hard to listen for all the obvious reasons because Janis is conspicuous by her absence. (She was scheduled to finish the vocals for this Nick Gravenites tune the day she was found dead from an accidental overdose in her hotel room. The juxtaposition of the uptempo, happy beat of \\"Buried Alive in the Blues\\" is at odds with the circumstances, but it is a fitting tribute that it was included on the album, and a stark reminder that Janis was truly a force of nature and an highly exuberant and joyous personality, even when missing in action.)<br />When last seen alive by the clerk at the Landmark Hotel, Janis was wearing a long red dress or skirt. Could it be the same skirt she is wearing for the cover photo? If so, it is a tacky gesture that swatches of this skirt are now being affixed to collectible \\"baseball\\" cards, being sold on eBay for about [price] a pop. The \\"Pearl\\" skirt should be hanging at the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame where it belongs. <br />The extra live tracks add some interest, especially \\"Tell Mama.\\" But the Full Tilt band doesn't do justice on \\"Little Girl Blue,\\" racing through the accompanyment. However it is interesting to hear Janis mention Nina Simone's influence. <br />\\"Pearl\\" is rock 'n' roll history, a must for every record collection. There will always be a bummer element to this album because of the association of her death, but her brilliance and passion shine on, none the less. All praise to Janis---Legend, icon, pioneer, the late, the great Janis Joplin,<BR>still-reigning queen of rock.
0374525153|5.0|I read some of the other reviewers' comments before buying this book. I thought: 'come on...! it cannot be that good'. I was wrong, Reunion's even better than that. The book was a delight to read, but the ending devastated me like no other book in 30 years of reading has even come close to. I cannot think of anything (Tolstoi's Hadji Murad, Kafka's Concerns of a family man, Shakespeare's Lear) that has the same emotional impact of this little book. I know, I know...  It's too much. Well, read the book and see.
B0000640VN|4.0|A romantic comedy between two characters from different times is an idea rich in potential.  Writer/director James Mangold takes full advantage of the possibilities in this enchanting film that juxtaposes the cultures and values of the late 19th and early 21st centuries New York City.<br />Mangold shows his versatility here by venturing into the light and breezy zone after strong directorial showings in the more heavy handed \\"Girl Interrupted\\" and \\"Cop Land\\".  Despite the clear departure from his previous melodramatic films, Mangold again proves is that he is an excellent actors' director, inducing terrific performances from the entire cast.<br />The story is full of heartrending moments and hilarious culture shock gags as Leopold (Hugh Jackman) attempts to adapt to the technology and attitudes of modern society.  Mangold is successful at making the point that though much has changed around us, we as people are still very much the same.  Unfortunately, in his zeal to tell a great tale, Mangold plays fast and loose with historical details.  <br />If one is going to make a time travel film, one should research the respective eras and represent history accurately.  The film is rife with anachronisms, especially regarding theater and opera.  Leopold is from 1876, but makes reference to \\"La Boheme\\" (1896), \\"Pirates of Penzance\\" (1879), and \\"Tosca\\" (1898), none of which had yet been performed by the time he left the past.  Also, Brooklyn Bridge architect John Augustus Roebling is seen giving a speech seven years after he died, and Leopold mentions Jack the Ripper, who didn't commit his first murder until the late 1880's.  Still, much can be forgiven for a tale so touchingly and amusingly told.<br />The acting is excellent by the entire cast.  Hugh Jackman's career grows exponentially with each new role.  A veritable unknown when he took the part of Wolverine in \\"X-Men\\", he blew the doors off that part and never looked back.  Since then he has delivered three outstanding performances (\\"Someone Like You\\", \\"Swordfish\\", \\"Kate and Leopold\\"), in all cases rising above the vehicle in which he appeared and eclipsing numerous fine actors.  Jackman has the potential to become this generation's Cary Grant, having dapper good looks and an amiable personality with the versatility to glide effortlessly from serious drama to charming comedies.  In this part he is absolutely magnetic, giving a performance that is as powerful as it is captivating.<br />Meg Ryan returns to her best genre and gives another terrific performance.  Ryan has enjoyed thirteen fabulous years since she broke through with \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" in 1989, but is in the twilight of her romantic comedy years.  If she hopes to continue as an actor, she will need to move to different roles that don't require the freshness and adorability that fade with age.  This role is a good hybrid, having her deal with the serious issues of a career woman, while also allowing her to slip on the romantic glove that fits her so well.<br />Liev Schreiber, Breckin Meyer, Natasha Lyonne, and Bradley Whitford all give strong supporting performances, stealing scenes left and right from the two leads.<br />This film is a marvelous date flick that is easy to enjoy by men and women alike.  The humor is truly funny, the romance engaging and the acting superb.  I rated it an 8/10, penalizing it a bit for the historical cheating, but if you like romantic comedy this film will deliver a wonderful evening of delightful entertainment.
B000065U1N|5.0|The US government through it's soldiers and armed forces are currently the balancing force of the planet.  This film gives exactly what it says.  Why not take these young people's places by &quot;living&quot; what they went through and understand how necessary they are to keep a just and fair planet for everybody.  Thank God the balancing force in the planet is the US and not...  many examples...  Sorry for any spelling mistake if there is any.  English is not my native language.
B00005K3NR|5.0|A great performance is determined when you turn the volume all the way down on your TV and just watch the actor perform.  If the actor can convey their role, using only body language, then the viewer can grasp the plot without any dialogue.  If this is accomplished, then you will know that you have just witnessed something extraordinary.  So is the case with this thriller by Brian DePalma.  Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White.  The actress doesn't see her performance so much as a task, but an embodiment.  We understand exactly what the teenager is going through in her eyes, her movements, her actions and re-actions.  Piper Laurie is every bit as good too as her mother.  What's even more frightening is the wardrobe on ALL of the actors.  I'm sure that in 1976 this clothing was normal, but today it only adds the horror and tension of the prom scene.  Watch again and you'll see what I mean!
B00005N5S5|1.0|&quot;Oh please the only good thing about the movie was Linda Hamilton's mullet.&quot;
B00005JKNC|5.0|I could not possibly disagree more heartily with the editorial review of this film. It is an excellent movie, and one well worth the price of admission to the Majestic.<br />As I watched this film, I was struck with nostalgia. Those years following World War II were a more innocent time. They were a time when certain values, lost to us now, were in full flower. Romantic and touching, the film centers on Peter Appleton who has turned up on the beach of a small town after an accident has left him with amnesia. He is mistaken for Luke Trimble, a local hero and the son of a local man named Harry, beautifully played by Martin Landau. He meets a beautiful gal, and they embark upon an effort to rebuild the Majestic theatre. However, the McCarthy era is in full swing, and all the power of the federal government is arrayed against him.<br />No, you will not find much violence, foul language, or scandals boiling beneath the surface. This is just a simple, pure, unsullied entertainment. I believe this is the finest effort by Jim Carrey to date. He plays it straight, and though it has humor, it is the humor of a typical human being caught in the middle of a time when blacklisting was in vogue, defending himself from unfounded charges amid one of history's most virulent witch hunts.<br />My opinion is that this is a wonderful movie. There are plenty of jaded flicks being made today, and the purity of spirit in this film is totally refreshing to behold.
B000000WJZ|5.0|Out of every great album to come out of the &quot;grunge era&quot; in music, none has touched the ethereal beauty of Siamese Dream. It's interesting to note that this was only the second major-label album by the Smashing Pumpkins, and it delivers so much more than Gish does that it is mind-blowing. Simply calling it an improvement would be a grave understatement because the album delivers on so many levels. It's a shame I wasn't at the proper age in 1993 when this came out. I wish I could have enjoyed it.<br />I digress. The 250 or so other reviews have pretty much delivered the message. Siamese Dream is a masterpiece. &quot;Cherub Rock&quot; opens the album with a large, sweeping, sound; heavy guitars augment Chamberlain's intricate drumming as Corgan delivers cryptic lyrics in his thin whine of a voice(which is NOT annoying--in fact it is different from the sound of any vocalist from any other grunge band). &quot;Today&quot; delivers its dark melodicism, beginning with the 'ice cream truck' guitar plucking. &quot;Rocket&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot; reflect each other as opposites, one being a guitar-heavy rock tune, the other an orchestral acoustic ballad. &quot;Mayonaise&quot; is a long, beautiful, softer arrangement--with very honest lyrics. &quot;Silverf**k&quot; is a 7-minute rocker with quiet midsections interspersed with the heavy rock. Throughout the remaining gems on Siamese Dream, solos blaze, lyrics begin journeys in the mind, constant innovation appears, and uplifting, happy-sounding, music fills the ears and the soul.<br />A true masterpiece and milestone of what grunge was. It changed history and shined bright, making '93 the landmark year it was. In Utero could never do the same. The Pumpkins were one of a kind.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie does not pull any punches. This is war, in all it's horrific worst. Don't get me wrong, this is an incredible movie. But it isn't for everyone.<br />Centered around teams of Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers, the film recounts events that took place in 1993 in Somalia. Sent in to capture a local warlord, the team is quickly surrounded by thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, of well armed adversaries. When an RPG downs a blackhawk helicopter, the men fight their way to the crash site to save the survivors. Shortly after, a second blackhawk goes down some distance away. Eventually, the men are surrounded an fighting for their lives against a massive force bent on their destruction. Vastly outnumbered and running out of ammunition, the soldiers defend their position for more than 18 hours.<br />This is gritty, raw and unvarnished war. It is unsettling, disturbing and very tense. What makes this even more unnerving is that this is a true story, rendered as accurately as possible in the film medium by director Ridley Scott.<br />This is a great film, but certainly not for everyone.<br />I bought my copy at a local store, where one veteran told me he couldn't possibly watch this film. It simply was \\"too real for comfort\\".<br />After seeing the film, I had to agree.
B000065U1N|3.0|This movie is good if you want to excite your five senses. great sound and nice setting. other than that, it is just pure senseless shooting. Many violent and gory scenes. not for the faint hearted. Overall, a war show that can be made better.
0312265859|5.0|Like everyone else, I devoured the latest Stephanie Plum novel. I tried to savor it, but couldn't. I was disappointed in the beginning, especially after the cliff hanger of Seven Up. It took awhile before we found out what happened on that night that Ranger came to Steph's bedroom. I felt sad for Steph during the book because Morelli wasn't there. You could feel the tension between them. However Ranger did make up for it. I still laughed during the book and couldn't keep a smile off of my face while reading it. I did miss Dougie and Mooner--don't know where they were in this episode except maybe recuperating from #7. This is one series that I can read, and re-read, and re-read. I don't get tired of the characters and I recommend the books to everyone. I have all the women in my department at work reading the series, and all the men know who Ranger and Morelli are. Definitely start from One and keep on reading. Write faster Janet!!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I don't know what the delay is but I think it's more about politics than worrying about people buying. What stand out about Seinfeld is that he keeps his jokes clean with a high level of creativity. I think Seinfeld's audiences are higher class (and I'm not speaking of money term) than let's say Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence, and Chris Rock type. Really, I don't see the humour in farting at the family dinner table like in the movie \\"The Nutty Professor\\". I love DVDs, and so far I have all five seasons box set of The X-Files. I'm waiting for the Seinfeld box sets. Let's face it, people like Seinfeld more than Friends, and they all ready have their 1st season out. I think people watch Friends because they want to see Jennifer Aniston, not because they find it outrageously funny.
B000066NW0|5.0|Sounding like a hybrid of Fiona Apple and Alanis Morisette, Avril Lavigne is a prime candidate in leading the movement against Britney Spears-esque bubble gum pop.  With songs containing punk riffs (Skater Boi) and more toned down ballads (I'm With You, Tomorrow), she's a versatile singer, as well as a songwriter (she gets credit for contributing to every song on this album).<br />Her diverse sound allows for enjoyment of the cd for a vast audience.  The first single &quot;Complicated&quot; shows off her playfulness while also proving that she has a real unique voice.  I'd definately recommend this cd to all fans of pop music and for those looking for a quality introduction to the new way of singer-songwriters.
0345440900|4.0|Well alot of this book conflict with what I do. BUT what I bought the book for was to figure out her cries and ect. Which helped, though I don;t do the EASY plan or anything else.

B000023VR6|5.0|Had anyone \\"Forgot About Dre\\"? Well after this release no one will. It's been a long six years since he put out the classic \\"The Chronic\\", but Dre gives us the CD we've been wanting to hear. He's dropped his familiar Deathrow/G-Funk sound and created a new sound to change (and introduce) rap to.<BR>When looked at this album must be taken from a production standpoint first and then the rapping. The production is great and as each song sticks out so much it must have been difficult for Dre to pick the singles for this album. \\"The Next Episode\\" with its bouncy, rhythmic beat, and \\"Still D.R.E.\\" with its unique use of strings show that Dre is still on top of the game when it comes to production. Dre's production skills shine in another way too. He's always been able to make rappers sound their best (remember RBX). Snoop shows some rhyming that he's been missing for awhile. Listen to Devin's guest appearance and you'd wish he sounded like that all the time. <BR>From a rapping standpoint there's nothing new, even 6 years from his first solo album. But he tried to change up his style to a less than warm response on The Aftermath CD, so without these type of lyrics it just wouldn't be Dre. Eminem and Xzibit contribute great appearances on the two songs they appear on and Hittman does a pretty good job with his first shot in the spotlight. <BR>Now the negatives of the album. Too many skits. \\"Ed-ucation\\" with Eddie Griffin is the only one worth hearing. \\"Bar One\\", \\"The Car Bomb\\", and \\"Pause 4 Porno\\" should have been left off. The song \\"Housewife\\" is just a remix of a Kurupt song and this remix also appears on a Kurupt album. Dre should have put another song here.<BR>The negatives really aren't much to complain about as this album is amazing. I was really impressed with \\"The Message\\" a dedication song to his brother featuring Mary J. Blige. This was a very well done song and it's nice to hear Dre rap about something very personal to him. Whether or not Dre writes his lyrics this is the best he's ever done it. He raps: \\"I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keepin a poker face/to straight breakin down and showin all emotions/I'm anxious to believe in real G's don't cry/If that's the truth, then I'm realizin I ain't no gangsta\\". It's a great song to end a great album. Plus, if you haven't enjoyed the album enough, check out the hilarious skit at the end of the last song. It's Thomas Chong, from Cheech and Chong!!!<BR>It was a long wait, but Dre came through. After hearing this album the fans won't let him go that long again before putting Detox out because he's still got it.
079073804X|5.0|The Exorcist was the first DVD I ever bought, and I was transfixed and became a collector for two reasons,<BR>The crisp image of the new digital technology enhanced the picture and sound and with it the quality of watching the film and enjoying it much more as a result, <BR>and secondly, having not watched the Exorcist for a long time,  being banned in the UK until recently, I was again totally captivated by this original horror film that has aged very well.<BR>Why is it still considered one the the sacriest films  of all time??<BR>simple<BR>1-Friedkin is a very talented director, and was at the  prime of his art when he did the Exorcist<BR>2-The subject matter, dealing with the devil. It was one the the first films to tackle the supernatural in such a style, as opposed to vampires, draculas, zombies and giant tarantulas that was the staple diet of the horror genre. <BR>Most crucially, using the innocence of a young girl, (played so well by Linda Blair, her first role and most important to date), as a platform for evil.<BR>Though the gory scenes are outdated, and personally I find them the weakest part of the film, they do show this conflict between innocence and evil in one person. <BR>The vile language and overt sexual overtones spoken by the devil through the child was the reason the film was banned in UK.<BR>3-The music is an integral part of the mood of the film, and using Mike Oldfield's 'The Sentinel', added a lot to the scary atmosphere.<BR>There are many disturbing scenes in the film, <BR>the gradual possesion of Regan,Father Damien's spiritual conflict,and his dream scene!!!!! very disturbing!!<BR>and the acting is all excellent, esp. Ellen Burstyn, Max Von Sydow, and the sadly recently  departed, the late Jason Miller.<BR>The DVD has very good extras, and  though I have yet to watch the new version of the film, I still enjoy the Exorcist everytime I watch it, and am scared not by the gore..but by what's behind it all..The Devil Inside.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Rickey Wright's review was really disappointing. When I really enjoy something, I love to hear an alternate point of view that's intelligent, well-reasoned and articulate. Amazon's reviewer wasn't any of the three. He just sounds like he caught this album on a bad day. Or, maybe he's just over 50 and considers himself too erudite for something that actually feels good. :-)<br />For context, I'll say that my favorite artist anywhere is probably Neil Finn: a master with a global following, who writes songs and lyrics that are widely respected. Elvis Costello is another fave, even if his music isn't always as fun to listen to as it is to analyze. And maybe that's the problem. Elvis manages to do all kinds of atypical things with his rhythm and tone and whatnot, and Neil Finn (while much more tuneful) writes lyrics that are often entirely inpenetrable. And critics just eat that up: you need to be at least partially opaque to get a good word from most professional reviewers, especially as they all seem to be at least 50 and want to show you how learned and critical they are.<br />And John Mayer isn't. He writes songs that you want to hum all day. He writes lyrics that I understand, even though I wouldn't suggest they rival John Updike for literary value. Does that make him un-talented? Not by a very, very long shot. He's not making any pretentions. He doesn't allege that his music is appropriate as a substitute for a post-modern worldview, but Rickey Wright reviews him as if he does.<br />This is beautiful, infectious music. Not because it's full of Britney Spears hooks, but because it makes me feel alive. It makes me smile. I listen to \\"No Such Thing\\" and \\"My Stupid Mouth\\" and unconsciously nod my head a bit and sing. \\"83\\" is a beautiful song about noticing that life isn't all it's cracked up to be. Is this the observation of a jaded, hardened, 60-year-old Bob Dylan? Hardly. It's a guy who's 25 (or younger when he wrote it) singing a sweet song about youth, and love, and innocence. I wouldn't listen to it looking for something else. And I surely wouldn't review it as if I was.<br />Buy this album. Buy it and listen to one of the most unabashedly musical and lyrical artists to come around in ages. Don't talk about him at high-brow cocktail parties. Don't look for the next Morrissey. Enjoy John Mayer, and fill otherwise dull moments with fun, beautiful, gorgeously arranged music. This is my favorite album in years, out of the 50 or so I've bought in the last few. I'm giving it as a gift whenever I get a chance. I think you'll like it.
0312265859|5.0|It was a long wait since \\"Seven Up\\" but \\"Hard Eight\\" was worth it. Janet has hit her stride. Everything we love about Stephanie and the gang is here--the wacky action and the hilarious dialogue. There are murderous bunnies, bears, and ex-presidents, a sweet new character (lawyer Albert Kloughn--pronounced clown), and icky \\"death cooties.\\" In this adventure, Stephanie tries to help a family friend and meets one of her most villianous adversaries, Eddie Abruzzi. Because the story is darker, the characters show greater depth. We learn more about Steph, Ranger, and Joe, in particular. Even Steph's mom gets into the action, coming to her daughter's rescue. I was a little unprepared for the way the Stephanie-Ranger thing was handled, but I think it allowed Steph to move on with her personal life. I loved the maturity shown by Joe both in how he handled developments in the case and in his relationship with Steph. I agree with other reviewers that ending was a bit of a shocker. It will be a long wait until \\"Nine,\\" and we see where the developments of \\"Eight\\" lead out favorite characters.
0671027344|3.0|I wish I could give this book a raving, shining review [...].  Unfortunately, while it does have its good points, it seems a little too unrealistic to be taken for face value.  The book reflects upon topics that many different groups of people, but especially teenagers, can relate to: trying to fit into the world when you feel like you're different, family ties, and hiding from problems.  Another good quality about the book is the casual style in which it's written.  It's easier for teenagers to relate to.  <br />However, I must criticize Mr. Chbosky and say that the language the teenagers use when speaking to one another is a bit stuffy for what a teenager would actually use.  Also, how many teenagers you know have experienced a friend's suicide, a sister's pregnancy (and abortion), a beloved aunt's death, the effects of LSD, and an unrequited crush, ALL in the same year?  Overall, what I'd call an \\"airplane book\\": enough plot to keep you reading, but not enough reality to actually enjoy.
0802130208|5.0|John Kennedy Toole presents an eloquent, vibrant look into the life of a consummate educated slacker. The protagonist moves through the pages with nonchalance and the reader vicariously thrills to a life that says, \\"I am not putting up with hassles.\\"<br />We get a real sense of the experientially rich city that is New Orleans, but with the amazingly diverse set of characters, it is fun to read in a city like New York.<br />It is definitely a tragedy to see yet another example of an artist with a real grasp of living lose his life so young.<br />Toole's legacy - this dynamic comedy opus - will remain.
0609610570|2.0|This book reads like something a highly-paid consultant would put together for an undergrad business course.  Bossidy's rich business experience and wisdom has been all but lost here in favor of cookie-cutter, common sense management credos espoused by co-author Ram Charan.  Moreover, the &quot;tag-team&quot; writing style can be irritating and, frankly, often rather drab.  <br />As much as I like Larry Bossidy and owning HON stock, he should probably consider exiting the book-writing business.
B00005RY7X|5.0|His style is amazing - he brings together so many of the best aspects of the best music of all time (AC/DC's amazing guitar riffs, and Metallica's huge, impacting sound, for example) to create a sound nearly everyone can love in some way or another.  He's the savior of hard rock - hopefully we'll see some attention paid by the labels, and a few more bands that fit some of the criteria outlined by reviewer Gareth Hall (probably a little ways down the page) making it onto MTV2.  An impeccable recording.  Obviously, a lot of work went into the writing, performance, and production of this album.  Buy it... now.
6305014140|5.0|I see that this movie has been reviewed by 295 people and the movie has a star rate of 4 1/2.  That explains a lot.  This movie wasn't ground breaking, but not everything is.  This movie had everything i like about animation: great blood, great fighting scenes, and a great story.  I think this movie is great in every way.  <br />This movie is a must see for those who love their movies with lots fighting and blood.
B00005N9CV|1.0|Diana Krall has incredible talent - too bad she didn't bring it to this project.  Pass on this CD, and buy one of her past efforts.  Hopefully she will fire the bozos who produced this stinker, and get back to what she does well.
0800177177|5.0|The sole problem with this film is the title -- or rather, the impressions that the title gives -- to one crowd (the literate crowd) that this will be a dark parable about excess and taboo in the vein of Stoker's novel, and to another crowd (the horror flick crowd) that this will essentially be a slasher flick with long teeth.<br />While a good percentage of the film is true to the novel in many ways, the underlying sense, the underlying essence of the experience has changed -- this film is an overwrought romance, not a horror film or a moral play. As a romance, it is beautiful, haunting, full of depth -- and full of Ford Coppola's incredible touch (you know you love it)... a stunning film and one of my favorites, I must admit. The chemistry between Gary Oldman (the count) and Winona Ryder (Mina) is truly seductive and the acting is nuanced and utterly believable by my estimation, though I can see that some viewers might see the entire film as being just a bit over the top...<br />But then, not everyone can easily slide into the role of hopeless romantic for an evening. If you can't, then this isn't your film. If you're looking for a creepy monster flick... you're going to be sorely disappointed, because it isn't that at all.
0312265859|2.0|I remember when I first discovered the series and would curl and laugh one weekend morning.  Four to Score being the hieght of the series.  This one, Eight, felt phoned in, like it was made up of rejected bits from other books.  Boring actually.  The scene with Ranger a crime.  I remember I always used to grin through their encounters now I could easily take a nap.
B000002U82|5.0|I am not much of a Pink Floyd fan, I've heard their songs on the radio for years and had thought about getting some of their albums.  Finally I picked up Wish You Were Here and couldn't believe how great it was even though there are only five songs.  After a couple months I bought Dark Side of the Moon.  And after listening to it I could understand why so many people have this.  The music blends so beautifully with the lyrics and I was surprised at how good the instrumental tracks are.  I love how one song flows seamlessly into the other on &quot;Any colour you like,&quot; &quot;Brain damage,&quot; and &quot;Eclipse.&quot;  &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;The great gig in the sky&quot; is another great example of that.<BR>    The whole album is a joy to listen to.  It's said to cross generations and musical styles and I can see why.
B00005O3VC|5.0|In it's way, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is not only a gem of comic brilliance, but also can, at times, evoke the sort of reactions you'd expect from Brave Heart or Lord of the Rings.<BR>No, hear me out.<BR>A scene can start off on a moment of abject, wonderful absurdidty. Then, in the blink of an eye, the nonsense is ignored. As the music swells, the heros enter an enchanted boat that bears them away to the castle... A-a-augh. Arthur kneels to thank the almighty Lord... and a sheep (or the skin of one, at least) is fired onto himself and his noble follower.<BR>Behold, the gift of Python. Chapman in paticular has the gift to play the most absurd scene with utter conviction. Sometimes, it's good to play it silly, but someone should allways be playing it straight.<BR>This can be seen frequently through out the movie: another example, outside the castle Anthrax (\\"Yes, it's not a very good name\\"), when Sir Galahad (Palin) beats against the door. \\"Open the door!\\" Or the opening. Or everything from the final taunt to the entrance of the police at the end, in one of cimema's great anti-climaxes.<BR>In closing, few dissagree that the Holy Grail is, if not The Holy Grail of comedy, certainly one of the great comedic films. However, it would be interesting for some wily editor to splice together footage to create Monty Python and the Holy Grail-Epic.<BR>Because the movie fills itself with dramatic nothingness, as only great comedy can.
B0000508U6|5.0|I first heard about this album on a U2 message board and went right out and bought it.  I was blown away by the terrific music coming from a band's first album.  Chris Martin's incredible vocals were definitely a stand out for me.  &quot;Shiver&quot; has a great buildup, &quot;Yellow&quot; is a fantastic romantic song, and &quot;High Speed&quot; stuck out right away.  The rest of the album is also great and I can't wait for the band's second album.
0804106304|5.0|i enjoy this book very much. i think it shows emotions very well between mother and daughter relationship. i like other books from author as well. i think every daughter growing up in america should read this book to understand how difficult it was to live in China.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I would love for someone to explain to me what all the hype was about. I admit that initially I wanted to see it but during and after my viewing I thought it was quite bland. It was colorful and wild and rambunctious for the first 10 minutes and then it began to center around the same drama for the rest of the time. They can't love each other!! but they do!! but they can't!! but they do!! Oh no! a rich man who's gonna ruin everything. There is one scene I enjoyed earlier in the film when all the characters try to convince the evil villian of the movie that they have made a play. But that scene continued on so long I again became bored. In the beginning the characters were portrayed as very cartoonish and they lost that somewhere along the way. Jim Broadbent I thought was brilliant. I didn't even realize it was him at first. I love John Leguizamo (who until I saw the film I didn't even know was in it), Ewan McGregor, and I suppose I have to say Nicole Kidman. They are all good actors, however this movie I just thought didn't work with them. I never got a feeling for the characters. There was never a time I hoped they would get together or the play would be a success.The only character I felt any emotion for was Jim Broadbent's. I felt he played his character exceptionally well and how it was supposed to be played. Movies are suppose to envoke emotion and this one did nothing for me.<br />Many people credit the director for his creative use of the music. I, my friends, my family and I'm sure millions of other people will relate something in their life to a song and begin to sing that song out loud. I do it everyday. Big deal.I've seen tons of musicals and because of my love for music and cinema, I would have to say Musicals are my favorite genre of films. However the old Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland films can never be outdone or remade. When they sang and danced, it seemed as effortless as breathing. They oozed musical theatre, the actors in this film did not. <br />Aside from about 5-10 total minutes of this film, I thought the whole thing was lacking everything needed to make a good film. Perhaps the big names and big lights fooled people into believing this was one of Hollywoods best, it didn't fool me.
B000002KMY|4.0|Dio era Sabbath gave the band energy and speed.<br />There is an enthusiasm and vitality in the playing that was largely absent from the last Ozzy records.<br />There is also a tightness in the rhythm section.  The band plays like a well-oiled machine.  It's not just a showcase for Tony.  All the instruments are featured equally and are not lost in the mix (remember Geezer's mushy bass mix from Vol. 4?)<br />You can listen to Geezer's bass lines alone and be entertained.  Probably his best playing on these records.  His playing is all over the place in a Geddy Lee sort of way.<br />I don't know why people dis the Dio albums.  Yes, there is a sameness to the compositions, Dio as a songwriter seems to dominate in all of his work (see Rainbow).  That also helps establish the Dio material with its own coherent style, though.  Overall this was a good thing as Iommi was running out of ideas before Dio came around which would become more apparent after Dio (and Gillan, the last gasp of inspiration).<br />I happen to like Slipping Away the best on this album because of the call-and response guitar and bass soloing.  It's only the 2nd time Geezer had a chance to do a real solo.<br />Also, the title track is ultra-heavy.  I saw Sabbath durign the Dehumanizer tour and Mob Rules was the opening song and Tony's rig was so loud and raw it cut right through my head.  It's a great riff.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I watched this movie with a group of people. I, being the only avid film fan, was the only one who seemed to completely get it. Alot of people said that this or that didn't make sense but anyone can get the movie the first time if you just have to watch! This movie is an example of Filmmaking. It's not just famcy CGI and huge celebrity names. This movie is based around a plot and the characters who make up that plot. This is a movie you will continue to talk about and recommend until everyone you know has seen it. It's just very well done. The performances are great and the unsequential order of the film made an interesting story even better. I read the short story before I watched the film and there is alot of differences from the story for example he uses sticky pads and a few other things that I won't reveal for those who've not experienced either. I suggest everyone read the story as well to see how it all began. I truly feel this movie should have got more Oscar Noms than it did perhaps for Best Picture. But despite it's lack of accolade's it is as good if not better than some of the films that were so highly praised and recognized. Christopher Nolan has proven himself a true Director with this film and Isomnia but credit must also be given to the writer for this film and it's original short story. All around great Film!!!!
B000002TWN|5.0|Having first heard of D'Angelo from his Voodoo album, I was not exactly a fan of his since the music was very advanced and raw sounding. Hoping that perhaps his previous effort was all that people say it is, I gave it a go.<br />And was I in for a treat. From the opening track onward, this album is often considered one of the earliest Neo Soul albums, and yet it does not appear to be evolving; rather it is fully formed! Both D'Angelo (with Voodoo) and the other great of the genre Maxwell (with Embrya) have distinctive ideas of how this music should develope. Until a new sound is developed from these 'directions in music', we will just have to be happy with the work of these two stars and hope that the work put out by other artists will be as great as Brown Sugar.<br />Favourite Tracks: Brown Sugar and Me And Those Dreaming Eyes of Mine. Highly recommended for R &amp; B fans who have just been converted to the work of the Neo Soul Movement.
B000065U1N|5.0|this movie is a perfect display of war. war is confusing, does not have an easy to understand story line. sorry all you criticts that did not like this movie go watch &quot;citizen cain&quot; again.
0062502182|2.0|it's still not on par with the little prince! i mean, it's good and all... it quite amused me but i was surprised that people actually compare this to the LITTL PRINCE...<br />it's a good book, but not really great... at least worth a read. but i don't really agree with what paulo coelho wants to imply.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|\\"We Will Not Only Defend Ourselves, but Make It Very Certain That This Form Of Trechery Shall Never Again Endager Us.\\"FDR 12/7<BR>Well it certainly did happen again on 9/11. Something bizare is the fact that this happened just a few months after the $150 million film pearl harbor. I thought this film was amazing, it was like viewing a piece of art from the 1940s. This was supposed to be thebiggest film of the last 20 years, obviousy it wasn't. This film has many things wrong with it. Anybody whose anybody knows that, but it also had many good p-oints as well. Some things that really got on my nerves are the nurses. This was a disgraceful way to present nurses of the era. They were trampy, annoying dimwitts. All they did was subtract from the film. The script could have been much more involving, yet it wasn't the worst. The musical score by Hanz Zimmer is won of the best I've ever heard. The biggest problem with this film is the romance.i' m not one for romances but I can tell you this one isn't that good. Mainly puppy love with cheesy lines. The acting overall was pretty good though the actors didnt have much to work with. on Voigts performance as Fdr was great, Cuba Gooding Jr. was good. Alec Baldwyn wasnt bad. I dont like Ben Affleck, but he did allright.Josh Hartnett was good too. I wish Kate Beckinsale had more to do as a female lead. All she did really was say hey boys aint I pretty. The historical innacuracy really didntbothe me to much. Braveheart was inaccurate ad it was great! How much you liked this film soley depends onhow high your expectations were. Since the teaser in 2000 I knew i had to see this film. I didnt enjoy seeing the japanese portayed as guys who were innocent and didnt want to go to war. Anyone remember the 7,500 americans who died at the bataan death march?<BR>The Bombing itself was soincredible it could makeucrap your -pants! The film dos a great job of showing the faces of the 3,500 americans that lost their lives. What the japs did to Ameica was unforgivable. Pearl Harbor is mjor american history. It is the event that launched usa into world war 2. My heart goes out to the boys who lost their lives that morning. not enoug development on the battleships though. Those Japs should be very greatful that we put them back on their feet when the war was finished. The film didnt show any racism toward the japs, very unrealistic. I wanted t see more of the natives. I would also have liked to see more character development between the male characters. If you havnt bought the p-13 version of the film you should save your money for the 4 disc directors cut. It has 12 hours of supplements. The new directors cut will show an all knew re-edited version of the film with a more realistic blooded up bombing. Itll show sailors being cut in half, decapitated, disembowled etc. Overall Pearl Harbor is a good american movie, check it out!
B000002C1W|5.0|I completly agree with steve from denver. Gilmore did a great job of leading the band on his own. I especially like Gilmores solo. One of the first Pink Floyd songs I ever heard was Learning to Fly, and I have been hooked ever since.  Most of my friends agree that Momentary Lapse of Reason is one of Pink Floyds best albums beside Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall. If you do not own this album I definitly suggest that you buy it.

B00005JKNF|4.0|Gosford Park begins with a murder of Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon) in his library after a shooting party. The suspects run from the upper class strata in his estate including Kristin Scott Thomas as his wife, Jeremy Northam as a silver-screen idol, Maggie Smith as a snobbish countess and a dozen more - along with a huge cluster of maids, footmen and cooks played by the talents of Emily Watson, Kelly MacDonald, Ryan Phillippe et al under the supervision of housekeeper Helen Mirren and majordomo Alan Bates.<br />For fans who crave an intelligent whodunit judging that Gosford Park is Jean Renoir's classic Rules of the Game written by sleuth writers Agatha Christie and Evelyn Waugh will be disappointed. It is precisely a smokescreen to dramatize and mock the British hierachy when the Empire was crumbling in 1932 under financial doldrums and servants pressing for freedom. <br />It is with Altman's mastery in his sweeping visuals that roam and spy amongst the upstairs-downstairs that makes Gosford Park dazzling in its scope of parodying - where you watch the snobs ostracize and the servants fornicate and gossip with deceit - and clinches him a Golden Globe Award for best director. He prudently trains his eye on the talented ensemble that comprises of British screen goddess and Hollywood stars who together, delivers top-notch performances particularly the restraint of Helen Mirren and the dry sardonic Maggie Smith. Julian Fellowes's screenplay which pocketed the Academy Award packs the merits up together to invite audiences to a wicked comedy of manners and class that you never thought could materialize in its scale and supremacy.
0375703861|5.0|It's really nothing less than remarkable that the author was twenty-four years old when this book was published. It reads as if it was written by someone considerably older, world-weary, and hugely experienced. This tale of two families has an immense cast of characters, each wonderfully well depicted. It covers such arcane territory as school smoking and its \\"rules,\\" Samad Iqbal's obsession with his famous ancestor and his neverending battles--both physical and mental--with his wife over their twin sons (who are the Cain and Abel of the tale); Clara (and her Jehovah's Witness grandmother, Hortense) and Archie Jones--English everyman and Samad's war-buddy-best friend. It deals with sexual politics, political politics, philosophical politics; the creating of acronymed groups of zealots (anti cruelty to animals; Muslim fundamentalism, the Witnesses); sexual peccadilloes; friendship; racism--everything, in fact, to do with the human condition. And the author deals even-handedly with all of it, with great humor and affection for her flawed, terribly human characters. This is a delicious book, chock-full of keen and tenchant observations made by a young woman who, evidently, never stops looking and listening to what goes on around her. London in all its wonderful, frantic madness comes to life in a modern-day Dickensian fashion that is nothing less than brilliant. Entertaining, funny, touching and beautifully told, this is an astounding debut. One has to wonder what Zadie Smith will do next.<BR>Most highly recommended!
B000002UAX|5.0|The reason I say that is maybe because 2002 has some of that same dark, traumatic vibe that 1968 had, with all the violence and tragedy that clouds our thinking these days...<br />The Beatles made music that captured the essence of as well as transcended their times, so it's going to be quite a few years before their music becomes trivial.  Still, I would imagine that some of the flourishes found on their other albums may be a bit dated, whether that's the boy-meets-girl innocence of their early projects, the psychedelic whimsy of Sgt. Pepper and Magical Mystery Tour, or even the slightly grandiose FM-radio-rock of Abbey Road. (Make no mistake, I love all these albums!)  The White Album has this interesting quality of being a Major Statement but still coming across as an intimate, casual set of songs.  The eclectic mix of styles, the somehow detached-yet-earnest lyrics, and the flawless sequencing of the individual tracks transforms the collection into something more than simply the sum of its parts.  The playing and production are clean and impressive.  One realizes just how good the Beatles were on their instruments, and the fertility of their imagination during this period is especially impressive.  They have been with us as an established fact for so many years that it's a bit hard to fully grasp how significant they were in our cultural history.  I imagine that most readers of this review already have the CDs and just want to know what others think of it.  So this is my opinion.  Well I won't comment on the tracks but if we are living in a postmodern age I think this album is the most pomo of all that the Beatles made.  And let's make Revolver the second-most on that list.  If you somehow haven't heard this set before then I can only recommend that you catch up with this masterpiece of 20th century music.
B000003TAL|5.0|this is Sonic Youth's finest moment. I stopped keeping up with them after Dirty. I don't really know why...maybe I thought, in my pretentious teen way, that they were &quot;selling out&quot;. Like a band that makes as much oddball noise as Sonic Youth does is going to ever be a radio darling. Theyre kind of like a cross between what John Cage does/did and the Velvet Underground. They adore cacophony, but they also like to control it, make it do what they want it to, experiment with chaos' nuances and see what comes out. Anyone who has seen them live knows what I mean, just watch them, applying screwdrivers, switches and static to their instruments ever so carefully, intently controlling each new noise they make. Its somewhat cold and uncommunicative, but the sounds are certainly interesting if you're willing to meet it half way. Nevertheless, &quot;Daydream Nation&quot; is by far their most accessible record, which by no means indicates that it is tame. Anyone who thinks Nirvana invented grunge or alternative music needs to stop here first and see what their avatars were doing long before Nevermind. The record has unparalleled pop rockers like &quot;Teenage Riot&quot; and &quot;Candle&quot; chilling punk scorchers like &quot;Silver Rocket&quot; and &quot;Eliminator Jr.&quot;, and extensive noise experimentation on the longer tracks. What's it all mean? I dunno, I can't even understand some of the lyrics. In fact, I haven't even tried. The music was good enough.
006092988X|5.0|I was assigned to read this book for school, and thought it would be dull, despite its good reviews. As it turns out, it really interested me about New York during the time of World War I, and it was really hard for me to put it down. I reccomend it to any one of any age.
B00005RY7X|5.0|Andrew WK has come out with the absolute best party music I've seen since the 80's hair bands.  It picks you up and make you wanna dance.  I highly recommend this album.  I stil haven't figured out why they haven't released the song 'I Love NYC' as a single, that would be great!
158234082X|4.0|Well Done, Chef! This is a fun read for anyone who likes to cook, venture out to new restaurants, subscribe to foodie magazines, watch cooking shows, etc. etc..... I purchased this book after hearing Tony Bourdain interviewed on a Talk Radio program. A year later I read the book. A good thing too....I've recently started watching his program A Cook's Tour on Food Network. Knowing and having heard his demeanor and humorous sarcasm from the show, his book read the same way. As it turns out I have even eaten at Les Halles years ago......So I'm a fan of this chef-his writing style and honesty! Let's eat!!
B00005B36H|5.0|When I first popped is beautiful album into my CD player, there's <BR>absolutely NO words to describe the emotional excitement I had anticipated and(still am) constantly listening to it.  No other TOOL CD I own quite has the emotional and physical power to dissect your mind the way this one does, and Danny's drum work is <BR>stunningly incredible.  He(and the other members of the band) put in their finest work into this album, and it has paid off.  If I could use one or two words to describe this album, it would be \\"devastatingly phenomenal.\\"  Sometimes, when I feel very lonely or depressed, I listen to my favorite track \\"Parabol\\", and concentate harder than ever, or, as some would call it, meditate. By the time Parabol transitions into Parabola, I am LITERALLY happy again and just rock the heck out!!!  Their finest work to date!
B000009QPG|5.0|Seasons in the Abyss was quite possibly if not the best Slayer album ever compiled.  All you mall core fruits out there who buy God Hates us All or Diabolous in Musica and think thats Slayer you are sadly mistaken... Oh yes very sadly mistaken.  If you would like a true feel of Slayers music purchase any of they're albums with Dave Lombardo as they're drummer.... Paul Bostaph is good too but Dave Lombardo is a drumming machine.
0060930187|5.0|I read The Bell Jar and was amazed. The main character, Esther, was relatable. Of course one must overlook the setting and date. I was blown away by Sylvia Plath's ability to describe the intense emotions that she'd gone through. For one such as myself, who had never come in contact with a person with these issues, I was stunned to, on a certain level, feel I could relate to them. The further you got into the book, the more legitimate you found her ideas. By the time I'd finished, I found myself questioning why she was institutionalized. Plath's ability to make me feel this way truely shows how great a writer she was. I would recommend this to someone in a second, and often have. It is a truely remarkable book.
630522577X|5.0|This is one of the few movies I've seen that I actually liked better than the book (Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion) even though the book was also good. Henry Higgins(Rex Harrison), a rich bachelor with an obsession for language, makes a bet that he can transform Eliza Doolittle(Audrey Hepburn), a poor girl who lives on the streets and has terrible language skills, into a fine, well-spoken lady. Eliza begs him to teach her how to speak properly because of her desire to move away from her low class stature. Eventually her speaking skills become so good, that she is mistaken for royalty by a noted specialist in language(Theodore Bikel) and becomes envy of all the ladies and the desire of all the men(this is during the ball scene, one of the best and most exquisite parts of the movie). What makes this movie so marvelous is the actors and the music. <br />The casting in My Fair Lady is perfect. Audrey Hepburn is not only gorgeous as a proper lady, but also amazing(not to mention very funny) as a commoner; she plays the role of a poor girl with bad upbringing flawlessly-the way she talks and carries herself are right on. Rex Harrison is also spectactular in the role of Henry Higgins and the two of them together have great on-screen chemistry. Both of them are dynamic characters who learn from their experiences and change accordingly throughout the entire film. My favorite character of all is Alfred Doolittle(Stanley Holloway). Holloway is hilarious as Alfie, Eliza's cockney father. The other, minor characters are also well-casted. <br />The most appealing thing about My Fair Lady is the music. \\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\" is probably the most well-known song from this movie and also the greatest. Another notable song include \\"On the Street where you Live\\", sung by Eliza's admirer, Freddy(Jeremy Brett). There are many additional songs that are famous in the movie including \\"Wouldn't it be loverly?\\", \\"Get me to the church on time\\" and several others. <br />The DVD itself has afew good features-a commentary by the art director, and a featurette about the costumes, makeup, etc. Not the greatest set of DVD features, but they are still not too bad, considering the fact that this movie was made nearly forty years ago. This is definitely one of the best movies I own-one I know I will probably end up watching over and over again. It's no wonder My Fair Lady won Best Picture(and many other Oscars) the year it was made-it has superb acting, beautiful costumes, terrific music, and also a mixture of comedy and romance.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love it.  I own it in VHS and DVD.  Please stop recommending it!
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I Only can say: ABSOLUTLY PERFECT. Its one of the most impressionat CDs I have ver listened and for sure the best CD from Christina Aguilera. Thats FANTASTIC! <BR>I hope she will be able to do a New CD as good as this.
B000022TSY|5.0|Most of the negative reviews here criticise this movie as being dated and for idolising the waster culture - possibly related criticisms - but it's difficult to see how you could justify either except on a very cursory consideration of the film.<br />Easy Rider absolutely refuses to idolise the sixties ideal, and it is not to my eyes even vaguely dated (I say this having seen it for the first time last night, thirty three years late).<br />The golden thread running through this film is that THE PARTY'S OVER, DUDES.<br />Fonda states this explicitly (&quot;we blew it...&quot;) and it's firmly implied in a devastatingly funny caricature of a dead beat hippy commune (as the city dropouts joyously commune with nature, scattering their seed on the barren land of the New Mexico desert, Fonda asks wryly, &quot;do you, ah, get much rain up here?&quot;)<br />And (without wishing to spoil the ending) by the time the credits roll, our heroes haven't exactly profited from their wild lives. The ending of the film is profoundly pessimistic about the prospects for freedom and independence.<br />The film is certainly critical of the intolerant &quot;establishment&quot; (which nevertheless prevails), but if there is one character who does smell of roses, it is the farmer who takes the boys in for the night and who, says Fonda, should be proud simply for living off the land.<br />For my money this makes Easy Rider ahead, rather than behind its times. It's also rooted in a number of great cinematic traditions, aside from the Road Movie genre which it helped to invent. I like the idea (expressed in a review below) that this is a latter day western, even down to the character's names, Wyatt and Billy. Also, were you to draw a line between Butch Cassidy &amp; The Sundance Kid and Thelma &amp; Louise, it would intersect Easy Rider.<br />The performances of the cast are delightful - Nicholson's is rightly feted, and Hopper's is very Dennis Hopper - fans of Apocalypse Now will recognise this style in which Hopper doesn't really act so much as simply looning around - here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).<br />If you fancy a dash of counterpoint, try watching Easy Rider back to back with David Lynch's stunning recent work The Straight Story - as a compare and contrast job, I think they'd make a fascinating study.this style in which Hopper doesn't really act so much as simply looning around - here in total contrast to Fonda's studied coolness, which holds the film together, reinforced with a cracking soundtrack (in this regard also, Easy Rider was well ahead of its time).<br />If you fancy a dash of counterpoint, try watching Easy Rider back to back with David Lynch's stunning recent work The Straight Story - as a compare and contrast job, I think they'd make a fascinating study.
B00005JKL8|5.0|This was a great movie. I think they had great actors and a good storyline also.  The movie constantly keeps you thinking.  The thing I really like about the movie is it wasn't all fake.  What I mean by that is you can tell all the gear he wears and the boats are real.  It even takes place on a real navy ship.  It's not just a fake Hollywood Navy flick, the stuff they do and wear is real.  I think they portray very well what the Navy is really like.
0553579908|4.0|Overall I enjoyed most of the book quite a bit; however at several points I considered quitting the series because I think some details should have been cut out to move the story along quicker.  The story line with Daenerys hardly made any progress during the book, yet we keep coming back to it.  I thought a lot of the details of the Arya story line were excessive also.  These are probably the two biggest examples, but I really think this problem permeates other areas of the book as well.<br />Having said all of that, one of my favorite scenes, which actually made me laugh out loud, involved some of the details of Theon's return to his native land, which others might view as  unnecessary.  There was also a scene with Daenerys in a magic house that could easily have been left out with no damage to the plot, but it did make for interesting reading.  I guess this work must be a challenge to edit.<br />I do find myself caring about several of the characters.  Tyrion is by far my favorite.  Arya comes in second (although, as I mentioned before, I feel there is far too much detail provided on her situation).  I always enjoyed coming back to the Tyrion story line and found the interaction between Tyrion and Cersei to be amusing, interesting and suspenseful - you just never know when one is going to make a mistake that will put him/her at the mercy(?) of the other !<br />The Kingslayer also shows some promise as being an interesting character.  I look forward to reading more about him in the next installment.<br />I finished Clash a few days ago and initially considered laying off the series for a while; however I have to admit that I miss getting my daily updates on the progress of the characters during my train commute - so I think I may need to get it sooner than expected !
B000065U1N|5.0|Ridley Scott's intense depiction of the 1993 raid of Mogadishu by U.S. Rangers is an absolute masterpiece, giving us the best look at the horrors of ground warfare since \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".<br />  In 1993, a vicious Somalian warlord known as Mohammed Farah Aidid is stealing food brought by American relief aid, resulting in a mass famine that claims the lives of at least three hundred thousand Somalis. U.S. Rangers and Delta Force are sent in to capture Aidid. During an October mission to capture Aidid's top assistants that was only supposed to take half an hour, two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, resulting in a 16-hour battle in which the ground soldiers fought for their lives while defending the downed choppers against thousands of angry Somalis in the city of Mogadishu.<br />  As well as giving us a realistic, graphic look at the movie, which is based on an actual event, \\"Black Hawk Down\\" also allows time for delving into the relationships in between the ground soldiers and how those relationships saved lives.<br />  This movie has to be among the ranks of the best war films ever made. And if I was leaving Earth for the rest of my life and I could only take two movies with me, this would be one of them.
B00004Z459|5.0|OK, most of ya ppl judge a song by how kewl it soundz. But not wit dis album. Linkin Park is in my opinion the greatest group of all time. Not only do the songz sound AWESOME but if you listen 2 the wordz, they can b really helpful 2 some people. My friend had some troubles in his life, so I  let him borrow my CD, and whenever he waz havin problems wit his life, he went in his room, put in Hybrid Theory (and some albums I burned with every OTHER track linkin park wrote) and cranked up the stereo. Linkin Parkz lyrics are just plain inspiring, and altho itz hard, I have 2 wait 4 the next album 2 come out. Hope this review waz helpful 2 all of ya!

B00005JL3A|5.0|I don't know what that critic was thinking, Resident Evil is one of the best movies out there. It has action, suspense, and a cool storyline. Even if it's not exactly like the game, it's still a good movie. If it was like the game, you'd know what was gonna happen and nothing would shock you. If you're looking for some fun and excitement, this is a great movie and I recommend it to anyone. Read the novels by S.D. Perry and play the games by Capcom, too.
014100018X|5.0|Chocolat - by Joanne Harris<br />Here is a book filled with magic and smells and tastes that had me craving chocolate and sweets the entire time I was reading it!   Chocolat is the story of an unmarried woman, Vianne Rocher, her 6-year-old daughter Anouk, and their impact on a small French town called Lansquenet.  Lansquenet is a very Catholic place, and the townspeople (parishioners) are very structured in the way they lead their lives.  Church on Sunday, abstinence during Lent - only a handful dares to disobey these traditions.  Vianne comes to town with a mission  - to show these people how to live and love and enjoy life to the fullest.<br />Enter Pere Reynaud. He's the head of the local church, the shepherd for his sheep of followers.  He hides behind the cloth and believes that what he preaches is for the good of the church and in the name of God.  However, a lot of hate and prejudice underlies what he preaches in the chapel.  He instantly sees Vianne as the enemy (her being unmarried has Reynaud labeling her from the start). Vianne, with her instincts and sixth sense, sees all this, and decides to help the town overcome Reynaud's unhealthy grip on their lives.<br />She soon opens up a chocolate shop in the middle of Lent, shocking the townspeople and Reynaud especially, but soon she wins many of the townspeople over.   We are introduced to many interesting characters, all of whom become Vianne's friends and supporters, including Roux, a rough-looking vagrant gypsy, and Armande an older woman with the spirit of a younger one.  <br />The book heads towards a climax with the announcement of a Chocolate festival at Easter.  At first the town splits into factions, and the reader is left to guess who will win - Pere Reynaud, or Vianne Rocher.<br />Told in the viewpoints of two narrators, Vianne and Pere Reynaud, the reader learns slowly of Pere's darkest secrets and Vianne's deepest fears.  Pere's narration is told as he \\"speaks\\" to an older priest and apparent confidante, confiding in him his doubts and sinful feelings, revealing secrets that are probably left untold.  Through Vianne's narration, we learn of her past and the reasons why she fears Pere Reynaud so much.  <br />I highly recommend Chocolat for its imagery and beautiful writing.  I consider it light reading despite some of its heavier themes, but all in all, a great summer read.
0312265859|4.0|I am admittedly Plum crazy.  Ever since picking up One for the Money years ago, I've loved hanging out with Stephanie and friends.  Hard Eight was another wild, amusing romp with the bounty hunter from the Burg.<br />Steph searches for a mom and daughter (Evelyn and Annie) on the lam here.  There wasn't much background on them, or insight into their situation.  However, I think that the main plot of every Evanovich book is just \\"filler\\" - the real draw is Steph's family, friends, love life and mascara! <br />Evelyn and Annie, and ultimatlely Steph, are pursued relentlessly by the nasty Eddie Abruzzi.  Eddie makes a particularly creepy bad guy.  He is more sinister - and masochistic - then the average Plum villain.  Thugs dressed up as bunnies, bears and ex-presidents add some levity.<br />I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the ongoing and complex Stephanie/Morelli/Ranger triangle. There is new ground broken in Hard Eight, but I found it unsatisfying - even if Stephanie didn't!  I hope that Janet revisits the story that was started mid-book.  It could be scintillating.  I was disappointed in the turn of events, romance-wise, that ended the book.  But then, a good romantic triangle always leaves some cheering and others wishing for what could have been...<br />I enjoyed Hard Eight much more than Seven Up, which was a little too cartoonish even by Burg standards. <br />Here's what I'm hoping for in #9:<BR>  More Lula and Grandma Mazur<BR>  An adventurous visit to the Bat Cave<BR>  An expose' on cousin Vinnie<br />Out of curiosity, does anyone else have an enhanced hankering for junk food while reading Evanovich novels?  Like Steph, the waistband on my jeans is a little tight and I have a yen for Tastykakes.  Worst of all, I'm in New Hampshire!
B000002HIK|5.0|I first heard of Aphex Twin from an ex-girlfriend who had a copy of the AT single &quot;Windowlicker&quot;. I loved it, I must have listened to the &quot;Windowlicker&quot; EP about 5 times before I went and bought another Aphex Twin album. The album I bought that day was &quot;...I Care Because You Do&quot;, and that was the day my life changed. The songs were constantly in my head, day in and day out it was all I listened to. Since then I've become the proud owner of many Aphex Twin albums and not once have I been dissapointed. &quot;...I Care&quot; is beautiful, dreamy and scary all at the same time. It says alot when songs like &quot;Ventolin&quot; and &quot;Alberto Basalm&quot; exist on the same album. Richard D. James must be given a standing ovation, for he has gone beyond music and created something that cannot be described in words. I'm not really sure why some reviewers think &quot;Ventolin&quot; is an annoying song, however I may be biased since I listen to Merzbow.
B000066C1N|5.0|I listened to the samples on web and I knew I had to have this Soundtrack. I rate it as the finest collection of Byan Adams he couldn't have been any better. One of the reviews said the lyrics weren't as appealing but I found them to be the finest  that Bryan has ever penned down. Some one who is looking for romantic soundtracks with a few high spirited adrenalizing songs shouldn't think twice before laying hands on this cd. The finesse of soothing Hans Zimmer music need not be talked about it touches your heart. This album is unbelievably superb go ahead and own it or should i say treasure it? happy hearing!!.
6302590388|5.0|L'Atalante tells the simple story of the trials and tribulations of newlyweds who literally float down the river of life. But there's much more to this movie. The poetic cinematography, the down-to-earth characters, etc. give the film an almost enchanted quality. So many things ring true in this film. The scenes where the newlyweds try to adjust to each other's habits and idiosyncrasies will have you nodding your head. Dita Parlo gives an excellent perfomance as Juliette, the naive young wife who's attracted to the bright lights of Paris, only to discover the seedier side of the city. Michel Simon's role as Jules has to rank among the greatest supporting performances ever. I loved the scene where Jules shows Juliette some of his prized possessions. It's such a shame director Jean Vigo died at a young age. Just think of how many more great movies he would have made.
B000065U1N|5.0|This film was definately one of the best war movies I've seen in a long time, being the reason I decided to purchase it on DVD. The cast contains many highly respected actors and if this isn't enough for you, the film it's self kicks ass. I recommend you pick a copy up today.
0618002219|5.0|The Hobbit is a magical tale of hobbits, elves, dwarves, magicians, and many other amazing characters. This book is wonderfully well written by one of the best writers of all time. JRR Tolkien makes you feel as if you are in the story watching the characters' journey and experiencing it with them. It is a fabulous book of tales of wonder and courage. Tolkien really makes you understand the characters and their feelings. It is a fantastic tale for anyone who enjoys a well written and inspiring story. <br />The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock rate up there with Tolkein and George R. R. Martin
B00006690G|3.0|This album wasn't too bad, unfortunately I can only give it 3 stars though. I guess I bought this cd because of all the buzz it was getting, but as I soon found out, \\"Business\\" and \\"Without Me\\" seem to be the only two songs that were thought through on this album. Eminem's a pretty good rapper, despite some of his earlier songs and albums, so I'd say this deserves it's three stars.
059035342X|5.0|From the moment I began to read I was transported to a magical world that you really can believe. Everyone will love the story of the young wizards and witches learning about their craft. The characters jump off the page, and you can almost see Harry flying around on his broomstick. This is a must read, can't put it down book, that moves so quickly the last page comes way too quick and the next volume's too far away to grab! Well-done Joanne Rowling.<br />If you loved Harry Potter you will love The Price of Immortality by C.M. Whitlock, it's a MUST READ for any fantasy fan
0553328255|4.0|I have only one beef with this edition of the book. NO PICTURES! If your funds are severely limited, then buy this edition only. It's complete and contains all the original stories. You can't go wrong buying this edition.<br />If you do have extra bucks to spare and you're a newbie to S.H., I'd highly recommend you first buy \\"The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes\\" by Castle Books, ISBN: 0-7858-1325-X. It contains all 356 original illustrations by Sidney Paget as they appeared in the Strand Magazine. These illustrations define the enduring image of Holmes and Watson as we have of them today. Even the popular PBS series by Jeremy Brett duplicates scenes from these illustrations. Unfortunately, Paget did not illustrate the first two novels of S.H. and died before he can illustrate the later adventures. But the illustrations will add much greater depth and enjoyment to these stories.<br />When you're finally done with the illustrated edition and you're still aching for more S.H., then get this complete edition to complete the adventures.<br />And if you're like me, being a British rebel (an American) and having no real knowledge and experience of what life in Victorian England was about, an entertaining reference book is \\"The Bedside, Bathtub and Armchair Companion to Sherlock Holmes\\" by Riley and McAllister, ISBN: 0-8264-1116-9.<br />This book can be read alongside your reading of each story of S.H. It gives a capsule summary of each adventure and lists some oddities and descrepancies to each story without giving away the ending. Also, it contains chapters which explains the life and times of Holmes' era and explains such things as monetary equivelents, etc. For someone like me who doesn't know a crown from a farthing to a sovereign, it clears up many areas of cultural difference and ignorance. This greatly enhances my enjoyment and understanding of these stories.<br />The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because I couldn't give it 4.5 stars. I just couldn'tgive it 5 stars because of the missing illustrations. A book which advertises that it's the \\"complete\\" S.H. should be complete and include the illustrations as they appeared in the Strand Magazine as originally published.

B000065U1N|4.0|Black Hawk Down is a terrific, bullet-by-bullet account of the events in Somalia in 1993. To that extent, it is faithful to the original source material by Mark Bowden. Reading the book and watching the movie, I was reminded of reading 'The Iliad' when I was a teenager. Like Black Hawk Down, The Iliad is  basically a chronicle of the deaths of the men fighting in a war.<br />Where the film departs the book is in providing  any kind of context, meaning or understanding of the two-day firefight in Mogadishu. We are treated to realistic set pieces depicting the nature of modern war, but denied any hope of appreciating the motivations behind the mob who set upon the U.S. soldiers that day. This attitude of ignorance towards the enemy is in tune with the times. After September 11th, the Bush Administration also rejected any attempt to understand the terrorists responsible, as if knowing your enemy was somehow tantamount to sympathizing with them. I guess none of these men have ever read Sun Tzu, whose 'Art of War,' makes the point that understanding your enemy is the key to defeating him.<br />The \\"Skinnies\\" in Bowden's book had brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters. Many of them had been killed by in-fighting between the warring clans or sometimes, by American ordinance. Bowden's book does not moralize about who's right and who's wrong. These questions have no place in the real world of war. The book merely tells the story of two opposing sides forced into a violent encounter heated by years of war and months of U.S. meddling in the region. The Somalis were tired of being roughed up and pushed around and the U.S. Rangers and D-Boys flown into Mogadishu that day caught the rough end of their frustrations as they attempted to defend their homes and country, not a warlord called Aidid.<br />The U.S. soldiers themselves were not bad men; they were merely symbols of a larger power in the wrong place that day. The futility of the battle and its ultimate meaningless came across loud and clear in the book. In the end, the soldiers' only justification for fighting was to protect and back up the man next to him. In that alone, there is a kind of nobility. The film touches upon this recurring theme in Bowden's book near the end of the movie as one D-Boy explains why he continues to do the job.<br />Ultimately, with the movie version, I couldn't work out whether war was meant to disgust me (a la 'Private Ryan') or turn me on and get me to a recruiting office. Unfortunately, Jerry Bruckheimer's involvement in the project (Top Gun - a slick recruitment movie for the Airforce), makes me think it may be the latter.
