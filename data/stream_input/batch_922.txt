B001QWQJ4C|4.0|Never would have figured it but I like Vin Diesel. If you're into racing cars (which I'm not) This should do it for you. Vin is the numero uno street racer and the cops are using an undercover man to bring down a truck hijacking ring. They go through several engine rebuilds and at least a hundred tanks of nitrous oxide to get to the conclusion and prove that crime doesn't pay. Alot of good driving stunts and a lot of action. Not Academy Award material but a good watch.

Im excited to see it like this and most likely will be purchasing it soon. I was able to find the first two season at my local grocery store for $9.99 a piece! So i lucked out there but good lookin amazon! thanks for the dealz!
0780626494|5.0|Without Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as the parents, this movie would not have been anywhere near as funny as it is.  In the beginning, Spacek and Walken, eccentric in their own ways, take a ridiculous premise and make it believable enough that you could let yourself buy into the storyline.  Brendon Fraisor does a decent turn as the son, though his acting verges on a one dimensional note.  Alicia Silverstone does the cute love ineterest well enough, but her performance is not as entertaining as in clueless.  These is an exceedlingly likeable film with likeable characters, and where even the ex-boyfriend isn't that bad.  A fun movie!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I absolutely love Paramore's new cd. I suggest that you buy it even if you don't like them because you may very well fall in love. It has a lot of good rock songs, but it also shows you the softer side of the band, which is so amazing. This is a great cd and I am extremely happy with my purchase. Expect something different - for this band change is good.
B002AT4K9G|3.0|Back when the first Fast and Furious came out, the souped up street racing scene was something, though not new, was not well know.  Now, after a wealth of street racing movies and the decline in the careers of Paul Walker and Vin Diseal, this movie can't capture the energy of the first one.  As a revenge movie, this film definitely has a darker tone, but nothing is really new.  At least Fast and the Furious 3 took the series in an entirely new direction, so long as you could believe someone in highschool had a massively receeding hairline.
B001C08RHA|4.0|This is a pretty good adaptation of the famous Marvel comic book character.  Hollywood couldn't resist having the film push a pacifist political message (Tony Stark abandons making weapons, etc.) but overall the plot moves along pretty good.  The special effects are really good.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, Tony Stark's girl Friday; she is absolutely spectacular.  She combines beauty with a charming vulnerability, and is perfect in the role.  Robert Downey Jr. was really not my idea of Tony Stark, but he carries the role off pretty well, and gives us lots of laughs.<br /><br />This is the best adaptation of a comic book superhero to the screen since Spider-Man.  Well worth seeing.  RJB.
0385504225|3.0|The success of The Da Vinci Code is a tough act to follow.  This book is okay; it is better than Digital Fortress and Deception Point.  The best of the Robert Langdon books is Angel & Demons.  It should have been edited better and did seem to drag.  Also I figured out who the killer really is less than half way through; it was sadly obvious.      That said; this is not high literature, this is pop fiction.  And for that it is okay.

B0007MAO0M|5.0|I love this movie.  I can't imagine why anyone would hate it.  Silverado has action, adventure, humor and just a little romance.  It's one of Kevin Costner's better performances.  I thought all the actors did a good job.  It's a fun movie.  It was meant to be entertaining, not a documentary of westerns.  I watch it once or twice a year.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|The best from AIC yet! The passing of charismatic lead singer Staley clearly went to the core of the remaining members and simmered, producing an introspective, consistent album full of insightful lyrics and rich layers along with a new bandmate who makes a seamless transition. Be at Peace, Layne! Your boys are carrying it forward.
0375826726|5.0|This long awaited book was wonderful!! My only disappointment is that Christopher Paolini decided to split the end of the story into two books. However I knew this ahead of time from waiting for it and following his website for the release date.  I can't wait for number 4. I wish I could light a fire under him so he'd hurry up!  I highly reccommend this entire series for fans of just about any fantasy type novels like lord of the rings etc.  LOVE IT!
B002FOQXZK|4.0|On his much anticipated debut album, Kid Cudi truly 'brings the heat'.  A conceptual album by nature, it takes a couple of listens for the true genius and beauty of this album to open up to the listener.  While in the same vein as Kanye West's [[ASIN:B001FBIPFA 808s & Heartbreak]], it easily trumps that album in construction and excitability of material. Odd and maybe sometimes too odd, there is an unrequited genius about Man on the Moon, even for the listener who may think Kid Cudi is simply mad. 'Mad' genius proves to be more accurate.<br /><br />The album opens up with the 'sleepy-sounding' \\"In My Dreams\\", which proves to be nothing less than curious. Instantly, \\"In My Dreams\\" makes the listener think and question where Kid Cudi is going with the entirety of the album.  The production is mystical and pleasing and something soothes the listener about this odd track.  Great, confusing, minimalist, \\"In My Dreams\\" opens the album strangely, yet very captivating.  A narration by rapper Common leads into \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\", a slightly more accessible track than \\"In My Dreams\\" (for the more 'straight-forward' listener).  Kid Cudi's flow is great here and his sung vocals on the hook are equally enjoyable.  \\"Soundtrack 2 My Life\\" proves to be one of many standouts on this filler-free album. Autobiographical, Man on the Moon could be the hip-hop interpretation of Pink Floyd's [[ASIN:B000002U82 Dark Side Of The Moon]].<br /><br />\\"Simple As\\" repeatedly loops 'A,B,C,' and '1,2,3' at the forefront, obviously affirming the title 'Simple As', ingeniously. Odd, spacey, stupid and/or brilliant, \\"Simple As\\" manages to captivate one's attention from start to finish.  \\"Solo Dolo (Nightmare)\\" is definitely a valedictory performance from Man on the Moon.  Exceptionally performed by Cudi as well as exceptionally produced, \\"Solo Dolo\\" is different, 'stream of conscious', and plain different.  By all means, it is nothing less than brilliantly conceived.  Mostly sung, though spoken in pitched vocals at specific times, there is something that connects with the listener within this mysterious fourth track.<br /><br />\\"Heart of a Lion\\" finds a slightly more hardcore Kid Cudi, obviously representative of the title 'Heart of a Lion'. The song lays as a tone poem lays within the orchestra trying to convey a portrait musically. Cudi excels with flying colors. \\"My World\\" featuring Billy Cravens again confuses, shocks, and impresses the listener with more autobiographical information about Kid Cudi.  \\"Day N Nite\\", the left-field smash hit that helped propel Man on the Moon to a #4 bow on the Billboard Charts remains timeless here. It could be argued its the album's best track, but with so many interesting, cutting edge cuts, it proves to be just one of the best of Man on the Moon.<br /><br />\\"Sky Might Fall\\" is equally as captivating as anything else. \\"Enter Galactic (Love Connection Part 1)\\" proves to be as strange as the oddest tracks (\\"In My Dreams\\", \\"Solo Dolo\\", etc.), but is also as solid as everything on this fine album.  \\"Alive (Nightmare)\\" featuring Ratatat, is catchy and accessible - well as accessible as this conceptual album goes. \\"CuDi Zone\\" is another production showcase and also another solid performance from Kid Cudi, though it is showstopping proceeding tracks \\"Make Her Say\\" and \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" that are stronger.  \\"Make Her Say\\", which lifts an obvious Lady GaGa sample (\\"Poker Face\\" from [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]], features an all star cast (Kanye West and Common). Ingenious, it has the distinction of being one of the best from Man on the Moon. Similarly, the MGMT featuring \\"Pursuit of Happiness\\" is haunting, strange, and beautiful. Along with \\"Make Her Say\\", \\"Day N Night\\", and \\"Solo Dolo\\", it is among the best of Man on the Moon.<br /><br />The rest of the album ends strongly.  \\"Hyyerr\\" has a smooth, soulful quality to it while \\"Up Up & Away\\" closes the strange yet interesting narrative that Cudi has so intricately developed onMan on the Moon.<br /><br />Overall, Man on the Moon: The End of the Day is a brilliant album, deserving many accolades.  It is one of few hip-hop albums of today that stretches the boundaries of the genre past lyrics about clubs, women, and drugs. Conversely, it can be argued this album transcends hip-hop and isn't truly a 'rap/hip-hip album'.  All trivializations aside, this is one brilliant album that I personally will be playing for years and years to come.n the Moon: The End of the Day is a brilliant album, deserving many accolades.

B000059Z8J|1.0|I am simply astounded by the popularity of this terrible film. One would imagine that one of the most popular superhero films ever made would at least be entertaining in a base kind of way, but this film fails in nearly every way. The script is the worst I have ever seen. The Superman universe's fictional laws are constantly contradicted and broken when it fits the director's whim.      The dialogue and acting are atrocious. All of the actors (and it stars people like Reeves and Hackman, who are both very good actors) portray their roles with a kind of smirky self-consciousness, as if to underscore the ridiculousness of the production. The dialogue is an endless stream of boorish cliches, from start to finish. This particular quality (the low quality of the dialogue) is overpowering in two sequences: the opening scene on Krypton, and the the bit which was probably intended as romantic where Superman and Lois Lane go flying around the city. The latter is worse. Lane's voiceover seems like a distillation of the worst elements of dialogue in Harlequin romances, purified to their rotten, insipid core. Dialogue this bad shouldn't exist.    The film is unaware of whether it wants to be good campy fun or a serious work of cinema. It tries to be both, and fails to be either. The campy plot, dialogue, and acting serve to undermine the seriousness inherent in several of the film's attempts at poignancy. And, likewise, the seriousness undermines the film's campiness.    This is the worst kind of film: that which requires its characters to act stupid or incomprehensible in order to drive the drama. It goes all out. Characters act randomly, with no explanation as to why they are doing what they are doing.. Villains talk about how Superman cannot be harmed by bullets or fire... and then proceed to attack him with bullets and fire. Luthor (who boasts about having an IQ of 200) describes his plot in great detail to Superman, and then leaves him in the same room as a woman who has just expressed horror at his (Luthor's) plans. Clark Kent states that he must leave the home of his mother, without ever expressing why he must to the audience: we (and his mother, evidently) are expected to infer this information.    What makes this film so offensive, however, isn't the poor acting, dialogue, characters, or plot (this is, after all, a SUPERMAN movie - you can only go so far with the material), but the fact that the script disregards basic rules of narrative construction, contradicting logic and this world's fictional rules when it sees fit to do so. At one moment, Superman must change in a phone booth in order to rescue Lois Lane. During another, he can magically change what he is wearing in order to address a threat by Luthor. Moreover, Superman can not only reverse time by spinning the Earth backward on its axis (a dubious notion to begin with), but can select which aspects of the past he'd like to change.    This film was primarily a spectacle of Special Effects when it was released. It has suffered the fate all such films must: its techniques are now exceedingly phony looking, and when the graphical prettiness is no longer an element, the film collapses.    I am neither given to misanthropy nor to elitism, but I must question the collective sanity of the people of this world when such a lazy film as this is so widely loved to this day.
B002JP9WN0|5.0|I'd like to weigh in on this before overexposure utterly ruins this fine CD for me. It should come as no surprise that as muse grows in popularity their music becomes more mainstream. That is a hard and fast truth that has repeatedly been proven correct throughout the history of popular music. The pop radio sheen has been polished brightly for this record. THE RESISTANCE is not like SHOWBIZ or SYMETRY, two earlier recordings that typified their youth and exuberance whereby the song's inherent energy trumped production. But even then they appeared to possess a grander vision of where they're headed. Their penchant for a larger-than-life sound, and anthemic showstopper mentality was apparent as young up-and-comers. Given the breakthrough of ABSOLUTION and the overwhelming success of BLACK HOLES it's only natural that this album would continue in that path toward US stardom. Consequently, it's at this point in the progression that I usually lose interest in a given artist. But I couldn't resist. What works for this band since the beginning is a combination platter of loud, razor-sharp guitars, obtuse lyrics, rich, layered vocal harmonies and classically-infused (nocturne-like) piano passages. The latter are also the components that many detractors obsess upon. Isn't it curious that those who routinely resort to tired old cliches like self-indulgent, bombastic and pretentious when criticizing progressive and art rock are themselves guilty of self-indulgence, pretension and verbosity in their own writing and (more insidiously) in their thought process? They know better than the unwashed, uncultured masses.     This is simply another superbly artful endeavor by muse. Matthew Bellamy's ambiguous writing and showy playing is at the core of this band. He has endured the unjustifiable accustations of being a Thom Yorke ripoff, which have finally been silenced. Now it's Freddie Mercury and Brian May that he's beholden to. Well, he's certainly not the first artist to dare reveal his influences. It's that melting pot of experience, talent and influences that yield the most meaningful, enduring and controversial art.    I fully realize that this is the record that launches muse to new heights but since I don't listen to radio for music purposes I pray that I am at least partially insulated from the unfettered hype that is sure to ensue.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a great gift for a family. I bought it for my 12 year old grandson who has already enjoyed it with his parents and 8 year old brother as well as two cousins and a few older friends. It is just fascinating and the narration is so well spoken. I bought this originally last year at $[...] as a gift for someone who returned it - too bad for them. Lucky for me this company has new un-opened packages available at a much lower price.  You won't be disappointed !
B001D57C0C|5.0|This is good for those who, like me, aren't neck deep into metal, and like only a little of it.  Three songs on here are really good ... the kind of good you put on a loop to listen to over and over.  Memories, Somewhere, and Pale.  Somewhere, in particular, is the most moving song I've ever heard.
B00009ZYC1|1.0|Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back.  While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside. I haven't seen a movie this funny in years. Bring the kids! I'd say 4 and up. There is some mildly crude humor, but little ones won't get it anyway.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|It's 1,000 years set into the future. Modern society as we know it is long dead. Human civilization is divided into isolated kingdoms that struggle to survive against an expanding poisonous jungle. Three kingdoms feature prominently, and the people of the Valley get caught up in a war between two other kingdoms over control of an ancient warrior that all believe can destroy the jungle.<br /><br />The protagonist, Nausicaa, is a brave, heartwarming, albeit naive character, and the vocal characterization by Alison Lohman is on target. Also memorable is the vocalization of Patrick Stewart as Lord Yupa.<br /><br />Miyazaki's pacing is perfect, which is what I like most about him. He gives us plenty of time in the beginning to drink the scenery in. The scenery is beautiful and the music totally immersive. The pace speeds up in the end, and it is a little difficult to keep up with all the things going on at once, but after a couple of viewings you get the picture.<br /><br />My only beef with the movie is that the ending is very brief, and a key conflict is left unresolved. Is not the jungle still poisonous and still expanding?
B002LVVCIK|5.0|Thank goodness there's a Michael Moore out there who will use the Mass Media for the correct and noble purpose of telling the American citizenry the awful truth.  How far we've fallen...<br /><br />Capitalism: A Love Story is historically accurate and funny.  While the movie does tug on your emotions to watch families being evicted out of their houses, it's not a cheap shot.  Your seeing real life footage of what the consequences of unregulated capitalism (aka: greed on a mass scale) has done to the United States of America and to most of it's people.  You also get to see just how devious and manipulative the people WE elect to office have become.  Ronald Reagan, the Clintons, W., Senator Chris Dodd and many others should never have been allowed to hold public office in the first place... and for those still alive, they should be stripped of their titles and booted out onto the street at the nearest bus stop. They can pay for their own ticket!<br /><br />While watching this movie I was angry, awed, surprised and inspired.  I was also concerned .... the way this country is going is how Germany after WWI started the Nazi movement.  We need a viable third party in this country badly.  I just hope that third entity doesn't turn into the Third Reich.<br /><br />This is a really good documentary.  It is non-partisan -- -- no one is immune.  Michael Moore has done this country loads of good by standing up and shouting from the roof tops about how this country's greedy elite have used the everyday American as their personal ATM.  Enough is Enough.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Being a huge fan of the X-Files, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Fringe. However, I was intrigued by the trailers and the fact that J.J Abrams name was associated with this series. I also happen to be a huge fan of Lost.  So, I watched the pilot episode. From that point on, I was hooked! I really liked how the characters started to evolve as the season progressed and how the interactions between them seemed to deepen and have a greater impact on the overall story. I also enjoyed the weird and sometimes bizarre stories, along with the underlying theme about \\"The Pattern\\" that alluded to all the incident's being tied together somehow. The glyphs and hints in each episode, the watcher, and a whole host of other things just added to the mystery and intrigue. Finally, another intelligent series that's worth watching!  Unlike others, I've really enjoyed Anna Torv in the role of Olivia Dunham right from the start. I think she does a splendid job and I really can't imagine anyone else playing Olivia. She owns the role. What better person to play Olivia, a character that's coming into her own, than an actor who is also coming into her own?  I don't think Walter Bishop would be nearly as wonderful, weird or endearing were it not for John Noble's ability to bring a maniacal depth and warmth to his character. He does it wonderfully!  As far as Joshua Jackson is concerned, I saw glimpses of Pacey at first. But those glimpses quickly faded and I started to really see Peter Bishop emerging.Joshua plays Peter very convincingly.  Obviously, I've only mentioned the 3 main characters but I believe all of the characters in Fringe make it what it is....a series that's worth watching every week! The only thing I didn't like about the series was that it didn't have more episodes the first season!
B00007GZR5|5.0|...that's the simplest that I can describe this film, which has become very dear to me.  It's a story about two people who find each other while on vacation and discover they are soulmates. They eventually marry and have children, and eventually lose those children to a tragic accident. Not exactly a spoiler here, as we fast-forward into the future about 10-13 years when the children are in junior high and high school. But when Chris, magnificently portrayed by Robin Williams, is killed in a tragic accident himself four years after that devastating accident, it leaves a shattered Annie (Annabella Sciorra) behind, all alone and fragile. In a nutshell, she attempts to find solace in suicide, but this act of desperation and despair leaves her forever inaccessible to her family and Heaven, or so one would think... And I'll leave it at that.<br />Don't look for religious overtones here, as some of the themes depicted may not coincide with your own views. Regardless, it is still a beautiful story; it was when Matheson wrote it, and it was given a new vibrancy with the motion picture. I am anxiously awaiting the Blu-ray version, whenever that may come...
0385504225|2.0|I'm sure it has been said but... on top of all that is mediocre in this book, I went  nearly crazy with the stream of consciousness asides.  They were so obvious.  They added nothing to plot development, empathizing with character, getting deeper insight, etc.  Just can't figure out why they were let in.  Help, can anyone clarify?
0385504225|3.0|this book starts promisingly, with a apparently good plot, the mysteries of the  Masonic brotherhood, the strange villain and the return of Robert Langdom. What seems to be a sensational story in the fist part becomes a hunt for a  Jason-styled monster in the second part and abruptly changes diection to a third part where the Hollywoodian-paced thriller is left aside and  the book begins the philosophical discussion^about who we are, to where we go, the meaning of life, the existence of God etc...It is a good book, really, well written, in Dan brown style (I cannot criticize his stylre because the others also have formulas) but somerthing is missing here. A real finale, maybe, or maybe  something more solid instead of metaphisical theories...
B001P3SA94|3.0|Darnell Martin's \\"Cadillac Records\\" chronicles the history of Chess Records, one of the most important labels in the history of blues and rock'n'roll. This is quite an ambitious project, however; any record company - Atlantic, Sun and Motown, to name a few - has a long history and it is impossible to tell it in less than two hours. The result is a mixed bag: great music and not-so-great storytelling.    In \\"Cadillac Records,\\" it seems, the history is less about the people involved in the music industry than about the music itself. Adrian Brody plays Leonard Chess, the co-founder of Chess Record, but the film doesn't show what kind of person he really was. In spite of Adrian Brody's effective acting, his character remains sketchy.    Some reviewers accuse the film of its historical inaccuracies. Even to a casual viewer like me, it is obvious that \\"Cadillac Records\\" is not very accurate in factual details. Chuck Berry (played by Mos Def) appears with his trademark duck walk, but Bo Diddley is nowhere to be seen.    But the most disappointing thing is the rushed and unfocused story of the film. \\"Cadillac Records\\" starts as the story of Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters, then Little Walter (played by Columbus Short) and Howlin' Wolf (played by Eamonn Walker) step in. While we can't be sure whose story we should be following, Chuck Berry arrives, followed by Etta James (played by Beyoncé Knowles). The narrative is weak, barely saved by the wonderful acting from the cast, especially Jeffrey Wright as Muddy Waters and Mos Def as charming Chuck Berry. Still, talented players like Gabrielle Union and Cedric the Entertainer (as Willie Dixon) are not given a chance to shine.    What makes \\"Cadillac Records\\" special is its soundtrack music and slightly nostalgic atmosphere of the 1950s. \\"Cadillac Records\\" is a worthy addition to films about popular music and its history, but it is also a missed opportunity.

B001E7X4M4|5.0|I the phrase I usually use to describe Unearth is \\"The only metalcore band to give a **** about.\\" I for the most part avoid metalcore because it falls into one of two categories, stuff that is too simplistic and I find boring (Hatebreed), or those groups who have melodic singing in the chorus that sounds completely out of place (Killswitch Engage, All That Remains). Thankfully Unearth avoids both those problems.    There is a more melodic/thrash influence with this release, the comparison off the top with be tracks like \\"Zombie Autopilot\\" off The Oncoming Storm, being the main type of sound. However nothing of what makes me love Unearth is gone. The guitars are insanely talented and will get stuck in my head so much swear they must be tattooed in my skull. Another big strength is the lyrics which are about the evils and hopes of society, nice to have something with some hope, rather than the majority of metal bands with more nihilistic world views.     I've read so many reviews of this band that seem to love to crap on Trevor Phipps vocals. I personally really enjoy his vocal work, because it has a \\"punk\\" like sound to it, which works for the metalcore scene, and doesn't sound out of place with their thrash sound. It's a nice change of pace from all the cookie monster vocals, and guys who try to sound tough, but sound like they have to take a crap.     The March is bar none Unearth's most accessible album. Note that I say \\"accessible\\" not \\"commercialistic.\\" This is pretty much an album chock full of addictive songs, with lyrics that beg to be shouted along with. It was most definitely made for touring; I saw Unearth open for Testament a few months back, and the songs off The March  (anthems like \\"We Are Not Anonymous\\" and \\"The Chosen) definitely got people shouting with the band.    My only minor nitpick is that the unlisted 11th track, \\"Silence Caught the Stubborn Tongue\\" stops and then there's white noise, till the other track \\"Our Callous Skin\\" starts. Why thesecouldn't be two separate tracks, instead of me having to fast forward. I don't know. A minor annoyance on a great album.    The March is the Unearth album to pass to your friend who's never heard of Unearth. Everything about it is addictive, the lyrics the vocals, and the guitars are fantastic, giving further proof to my theory that Unearth is the only metalcore band worth giving a **** about.
B002GU5V24|4.0|I have purchased all the preceeding Genesis boxes and I have been exceedingly happy with them.  My stereo system is in the low to mid-range of ability.  That said, I am happy with the remastering and remixing of those sets.    I am also thrilled with this set.  In fact, I feel these discs, especially the oldest album (Live 1973) benefits the most sonically.    However, having been cleaned up I am a bit surprised at how sloppy that first live album is, at least as far as Rutherford's bass work and, to a lesser degree, Hackett's guitar.  The cleaning has shed a light that had been covered for a while.  While this is normal for the time period, where edits on to live recording were not done, it is refreshing, as it gives it a sense of immmediacy.  I applaud them for retaining the bum notes.    All the rest of the CDs are in pristine shape, with great instrument seperation.  I've only listened to a handful of the 5.1s (that's on the family system and they aren't as into this music as I am) but I have listened to all of the stereo remasters.  Of all the boxes I feel that this one was done the best as far as the remastering.    As another reviewer noted, though, there are two major glitches from edits on the Seconds Out CDs.  It is annoying and it was avoidable.  I hope Rhino fixes this glitch.    Some complain that there is no video here or 5.1 of Three Sides or a Mama's tour included, and the other live material released (b-sides of singles, 12\\" singles, etc.).  These are legitamate gripes, but we need to concentrate on what we have.  Most of the best live video is on the DVD disc's of the other sets or is set to be released in the Genesis Movie Box Set which will contain the official released videos redone in 5.1 sound.    As far as this one goes, the remastering and remixing are excellent, the material is excellent, but the glitches, to me, knock it down a star.  Four stars.  Recommended.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|Every review of this movie that has given it any less than an 8 has been filled with one of two things--a) exaggerating the sometimes poor quality, or b) talking about how great this could have been if it had instead given more thought to the politics involved. To both I must say a grain of salt and a pattern of objectivism is needed to appreciate just how good this movie is. I saw it expecting a decent action film, because Ridley is a great action director, but came out feeling utterly overwhelmed because this movie is the epitome of recounting a battle in its horrifying, realistic sense.  The dialogue is somewhat poor. At the end of the film in Hartnett (I think it was him)'s last monologue, especially, people have complained of the lame simplicity and gung-ho-ishness. But, I must say, having read the book for English (and everyone shoud both see this and read the book, for historical/appreciatory purposes involving the soldiers who make such valiant sacrifices) that the dialogue, while admittedly simplistic in intent and uncomfortably gung-ho; is true to the dialogue and feelings expressed by the soldiers who Bowden interviewed. Therefore, cut the bias, and recognize the realism present throughout the movie, even in dialogue.  On the matter of the lack of political motivation the most obvious argument, of course, is that there is no time in the movie, and that is a good reason. Even better, and far more obvious, is that this movie is not at all about those events, as made clear in the sweet dialogue in which a Delta forcer tells Hartnett he'll be able to think about that plenty when he gets back from the battle. Even still, some symbolic stuff has been woven, things that did not happen in the battle, that works in the movie to express some of these motivations fairly well. Also, even further, the book did not occupy itself with these motivations much, either, and fittingly so. For, this movie is about the battle, and does a damn good job of presenting it, but that is so obvious I need not talk of it.  On the biggest qualm people have had with this movie--lack of character development--I, too, felt a certain amount of lack in this. While I have yet to see Saving Private Ryan, I understand how getting to know the characters even further in this film might have served to its advantage. To that problem, the answer lies in a couple of sources. On the matter of editing, this film does a great job, I think, of focusing on the battle at just a long enought time for the events in it (this is after reading the book, mind you, so mock me if you want for that bias). They are especially hard to express because of the totally chaotic nature of the battle, but the movie did as well as the book (which was perfect) within its own timeframe. Which comes to the answer, which is, that having more character development would either a) make the movie too long or b) have to take away some of the events from the battle. A few of the important parts of the battle are not included in the movie, even, so removing any more would take away from the battle even farther. Also, the other thing, is that by not including as much the soldiers become more of a unit helping eachother, sometimes as individuals, creating even further the feeling of responsibility to this unit. IMHO.  Now that I am done rambling about people having biases, all I have left is to say that this movie is perfectly directed and cinemated (not a word) and acted for what it is--a recounting of modern warfare. It is as intense and realistic as movies can go for that objective. The biggest problem is in the sometimes weak dialogue, and it is not only easily forgiven, but somewhat fitting for the people who speak the words. Everyone should see it for that reason (unless you have a weak stomach) and also for the historical fact of the matter.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I have read several of Dan Brown's novels including The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons.  I have enjoyed his work in the past, and looked forward to reading this new book.  I downloaded the Kindle edition of The Lost Symbol within a few days of its release.  While I did read the whole book, the most I can say is that it is O-K.  I found if you take the first two books, use a different setting and a different secret organization, you will have The Lost Symbol.  This book makes me worry that Dan Brown is becoming a cookie cutter author intent not on writing good books, but on selling movie plots.  I did read to the end to find out what happened, but overall I was not terribly excited by the book.
0691142165|5.0|Rogoff and Reinhart, two very substantive (and, I might add, earnest) economists, have produced a prodigious work which will be read and studied for years. They have gathered mountains of data from primary and secondary sources and reduced it to dozens of charts and graphs, a heroic work in its own right. Their intention, God bless 'em, is to lay out the follies that have led to economic/financial crises over the last eight centuries. Their findings: humans have not learned from past mistakes. The title is ironic and is worthy of Peter DeVries.    The authors say it is \\"almost comical\\" that no governments reveal their true financial condition today, nor have they done so in the past. The lack of transparency and the shenanigans that go on behind the curtains contribute, of course, to the human suffering that ensues in crisis after crisis.          One needs to find this book comical if one is not to slip into a permanent depression about the utter failure of national leaders to address shortcomings in national domestic and foreign economic policies in order to avoid systemic crises. No one has, from the 13th century onward, anywhere in the world.    The authors persist in saying that they hope their monumental effort will lead to an examination by policymakers of past mistakes and help them avoid future mistakes. I say, \\"Good luck with that.\\" In my opinion, this book ranks with the complete works of Shakespeare in illuminating the human condition. Or Bruegel, or Beethoven. It will not bring about change, but it will entertain in a deeply satisfying way.
1582701709|1.0|Most of the world wants to look young when they're old. Rhonda claimed she was working on reversing the aging process in herself. Has she anti-aged yet? Doesn't seem to have done last time I looked at her.  Point being, if she cannot manage to make herself look young again, then how can the promise she makes that \\"anything\\" is achievable be true?     I'm aware that some do not want to hear this, but I've seen the misery that believing in false promises causes when over time the 'promise' has not been fulfilled and the sad reality is staring them in the face every time they look in a mirror. Better if they had never been given false hope in the first place than to feel they have somehow done something 'wrong' when what they wanted failed to materialise.    Rhonda is not the only Law of Attraction author to claim that aging can be reversed using the power of thought. Deepak Chopra wrote a book on it a few years ago. Compare him now to the photographs of him then! He looks much older now. Why does he? Surely he should hardly have aged at all?! Which brings me back to my original point - if one of the fundamental desires (reversing aging) cannot be achieved by the very authors who write these books claiming that it can be, then how on earth can anyone still go on believing when the facts to the contrary are only too evident? When people like Rhonda Byrne and Deepak Chopra show they have succeeded in reversing the aging process then there truly will be something to believe in! Until then......
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|this book was a waste of his time. yes there was some mystery and some thrills but the whole story was poorly done. he should have just started with a different character and moved along a more interesting story line.
B001YYQ9SS|4.0|I have seen Advent Children a countless number of times and I have to say that the Blu-ray version is worth the extra purchase.  Not only does the extra content help the storyline make more sense (the original story almost doesn't make sense), the higher image resolution takes it up a notch further.  The \\"Complete\\" in the title makes sense for this film and it does leave the viewer feeling like the story is resolved.  Plus, though the extra content isn't as good as the Japanese version (no FFXIII demo), there is still a really beautiful trailer of Final Fantasy XIII that re-kindled my desire for that game.  Overall, a great purchase and worth the extra trip through the world of Advent Children.
0060594896|5.0|Wow, is all I can say.  Jack Canfield covers every aspect of self help in this one.  His plain speaking style and direct no nonsense advice is the best I have read.  I was first saw Canfield in the movie \\"The Secret\\".  He came across as believable and genuine, so I decided to pursue his other stuff.  This is my first book that I have gotten from Canfield and am glad I did.  I highly recommend \\"The Secret\\" as well.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|I love Skynyrd, since 1988 when I was 15 and caught the tribute tour hooked ever since.  I like alot of the post classic Skynyrd releases, particularly Vicious Circle.  This is another great album with many many excellent themes and lyrics.  It could be a continuation to their last album but sadly the piano is mostly absent, at least not mixed up front, and you're lucky to hear a piano solo. Anyone who talks about Skynyrd, talks about the great guitars of Collins/Rossington/King/Gaines, but Billy 'Gifted hands' Powell was Skynyrds ultimate weapon, and this album shows he really is missed.  I like this album, but if your a Skynyrd fan, you'll know what I am talking about.
B002LL13BQ|5.0|Well, we got the 1977 version on DG (which is Historic by itself), and we got the 2008 version on EMI in HD, but, this 1982 version have been released before, but, now being reissued on (You guessed it) DG.    This 1982 version is the first season the Franco Zeffirelli production was unveiled, and have the plus of Renata Scotto as Musetta (The role she first sang at the Met a week after the first Boheme telecast).    If you like Scotto as Mimi in the 1977 version, then, you'll like her as Musetta in this one. Otherwise, it'll be great to place the EMI version on the shelf gathering dust, while the other versions remained play often to compared Scotto mainly.
B001CC7PPI|5.0|Rear Window comes in a nice jewel case that resembles the hardcover jacket of a book, it closes and opens with a click and looks good.    If you're searching for Rear Window to purchase, then you know why you're doing that--there is a lot to this movie. In class we watched and analyzed nearly every shot in the film. The point of the movie itself is to explore the very nature of the cinema-going experience. The viewer is essentially a voyeur into the lives of the characters onscreen exactly as James Stewart's L.B. Jeffries is a voyeur into the private lives of his neighbors.    Awesome!  HC
0385504225|5.0|I thought the book was unique, spooky and exciting. It was hard to put down, and I was trying to solve the Masonic secrets and puzzles all along. I even had my own theories about them as I read the book. Dan Brown's books are unusual novels in which teachings are slipped in. The teachings are deep and real food for thought. The The book was a bit too long, but other than that I found it fascinating.
1881273873|4.0|This book is great!  If you've never read the original, The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to Your Mate, you won't feel like you're missing anything.  If you have read the original, you can see how this addresses expressing love in relationships from a different angle, expounding upon what the first book focused on.  I definitely identified with several examples Dr. Gary Chapman used to get the point across and look forward to improving my existing relationships while building new ones :)
B0029LHW4U|4.0|If you have ever been a fan of Alice in Chains then you will love this album. It brilliantly displays all the musical chemistry they were known for in the 90's before the loss of their original singer. The music is dark and heavy with lots of guitar layers. The vocals are full of excellent harmonies which are often identical to the original sound produced by the band on their early masterpieces. The entire album is consistently strong and is a great step forward for the band. At the very least it's a great addition to their legacy and certainly hasn't tarnished their reputation or the memory of Layne Staley. Highly recommended to all Alice in Chains fans.
B001EO748M|5.0|This makes whatever has gone in our government over the last 70 years  seem like patty cake. The acting is superb, the actors are marvelous  and I specially like the woman who played Queen Katherine of Arigonne.    I am eager to see Season 3.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Among the maxims carved on the entrances to the Greek temple of Apollo at Delphi, perhaps the most familiar and important were \\"know thyself\\" and \\"nothing in excess.\\"  We have reached a point, two and a half millenia later, where we could really use both pieces of advice.  This film offers valuable wisdom to a culture in which the self is defined by the products we buy in far too much excess.<br /><br />If we are what we eat, then most of us (this author included) have hardly any idea who or what we are.  We live in a culture of abstraction: we don't see what goes into the products we buy, and are unaware of the true costs of the food that sustains our lives.  Director Robert Kenner has created a film that puts various pieces of the puzzle together, and helps make clear what it is we're buying, and what it is we're buying into, when we demand cheap eats, and reveals the truth behind the illusion that most of our food comes from quaint farms.<br /><br />As the film shows, by means of interviews, animations, effective video and surveillance tapes, there are hardly any family farms anymore, and most of our meat comes from massive factory farms in which animals are packed in tightly, wading through their own manure, rife with disease that is only partly kept in check by pumping chickens or pigs or cattle full of antibiotics.  That meat, of course, ends up in our food supply and in the fast food hamburgers, and there's hardly any effective oversight for consumer safety because, as it turns out, most of the regulators for the past couple of decades have been drawn directly from prominent positions in the industries they are supposed to regulate.  Then, there's the matter that all of these animals are mostly fed on corn, and most everything else we eat is made from corn or soy or corn and soy byproducts (such as high fructose corn syrup), primarily because corn is heavily subsidized in the United States, so that it can be sold below the cost of production.  The majority of the soy, it turns out, is bioengineered and patented by the same chemical company that produced those innovations we know as DDT and Agent Orange - and that same company (Monsanto) has made it virtually impossible for farmers to grow anything else but the seed that they must buy from Monsanto.  Not only that, but Monsanto's patents have made it illegal even for farmers to save their own seed from season to season, and Monsanto enforces its hegemony by means of intimidating lawsuits that most farmers just can't afford to fight.  It's a depressing story, made somewhat lighter by the inclusion in the film of a few somewhat successful crusaders fighting to bring healthy and sustainable farming and growing practices to the mainstream and to fight against the powers that profit a great deal from cheap and unhealthy foods.<br /><br />The film offers only a bit in the way of positive suggestions for real change, and that may be its main weakness.  Of course, the advice it does offer is probably the only advice you can offer: first, vote for good foods with your wallet by buying organic and local, and by encouraging distributors like Walmart to expand their healthy offerings; and secondly, organize and wield political power to support candidates who encourage green practices and to encourage elected officials to favor better regulation.  I think it would have been more effective to highlight these messages clearly one at a time throughout the film, at strategic points, rather than mostly in a few written suggestions at the very end of the film and just before the credits.<br /><br />Still, this is an important film that conveys a number of important and harrowing truths about the food industry more clearly and effectively than I've seen it elsewhere.  Of course there is Eric Schosser's [[ASIN:0060838582 Fast Food Nation]], and Michael Pollan's [[ASIN:0143038583 The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals]], but both of them are featured here and this is a quickand effective way to convey the most important messages, that could be explored further.  Highly recommended.vey the most important messages, that could be explored further.  Highly recommended.
B00006L90T|5.0|Scenario: What would you do if you were suddenly plunged into a world where you didn't belong?<br /><br />&#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; was presented originally as a drive-in horror flick for teen consumption. However, it certainly was superior to the usual fare of the time. Had it been filmed in Europe instead of America, it may have even been given the status of an arthouse classic. It's maker, Herk Harvey, was a specialist in industrial films and, as the story goes, he made this &#34;B&#34; movie cheaply as somewhat of an experiment to see what he could do in broader cinema. In Harvey's only concession to glamour, he introduces the story with pretty young ladies and that serves as an obvious hook for the mostly adolescent-targetted audience the film would have initially reached. &#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; may have, in part, been inspired by a &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; episode called &#34;The Hitchhiker&#34;. Be that as it may, this film really works.<br /><br />Brief synopsis: A young woman thinks she has survived a car accident. Then, on a dark and lonely road trip, there appears a ghostly stranger who follows her everywhere and demands her hand in a macabre dance that takes place in a derelict carnival site. Mary tries to put this aside as an illusion brought on by the shock of her accident... or perhaps she is the victim of a stalker? So, after having arrived in a new state, our heroine attempts to work a normal job and lead a normal life. However, she periodically loses touch with the stream of life around her, seeming to go out of existence as far as the world is concerned. In one of these dissociation episodes, Mary is directed to a departure gate and, anticipating a way out, instead finds a bus loaded with souls who want to spirit her away. She flees from them and arrives at another gate but when she attempts to go through it, it is locked by the gate-keeper. Another interesting element is introduced when we find Mary in the dressing-room of a clothing store. She is initially unable to manipulate the lock, as if she still feels trapped in the car and trying desperately to get out: simple tasks have come to reflect her trauma. In fact, hardly anything in her world is what it once seemed. For example, the people appear as typical yokels but may hide a transcendental role as angels and demons directing her strange new journey (take special note of her annoying neighbor, Mr Linden, emerging from the waters with the other souls near the end of the drama). Mary is regularly drawn to the abandoned carnival site and wanders the grounds, alone and bewildered, occasionally startled by echoes of life once abundant there. She no longer feels an attachment to living people because she has become separated from her soul and is now a phantom, haunting her own world. This is a problem that needs to be resolved, so the characters in her strange new environment must play their part in uniting her with her soul and its brethren in death, a process she resists with the determination of one clinging to the last, thin threads of life. Mary Henry - Henry Mary, the name is interchangeable as everyman and the plot is emblematic of the dead warrior's journey in purgatory... The ending is less important; it only serves to complete the circle.<br /><br />&#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; is more ghost story than &#34;B&#34; horror. It is themed on dread and isolation; of being &#34;dragged&#34; into a corporeal nightmare, and so doesn't require the obligatory violence that attempts to shock the audience with scenes of blood-curdling murder. The eerie tale seems almost innocuous at first, but eventually inveigles its spell into the viewer's sub-conscious. I must admit, it got into my dreams once or twice, as did the creative music and some of the better cinematography.<br /><br />Depending on the temperament of the viewer, this film could also be regarded as a dark comedy when seen from the perspective of a girl being pursued for her charms and talents by both the living and the dead, in a grotesque &#34;tug of war&#34;. However, I prefer to think of it as existential horror rather than a veiled farce.<br /><br /> &#34;Carnival of Souls&#34; has a few flaws in both script and filming but this can be excused due to the lack of financial resources available in its making. In spite of its &#34;home made&#34; appearance and some mediocre acting, this supernatural tale is surprisingly nuanced and hence highly recommended. Make sure it's the  black and white, 1962 director's cut.<br />Yes, it could have been done more professionally, but what do you want for 35 thousand dollars? This film deserves 5 stars for achieving so much with so little.y both the living and the dead, in a grotesque &#34;tug of war&#34;.

B000NU2CY4|4.0|This review is for the UK Steelbook release (same transfer as US version). I viewed it on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Panasonic player.<br /><br />I am a huge, long-time fan of this film, and like many, was looking forward to the Blu-Ray release. Although I had read some preview reviews, I am very impressed with this Blu-Ray. I do not own the UK Superbit, which I am told is a better overall transfer, but in comparison to the standard definition version, which I did own, this film is an obvious upgrade. I own 390+ Blu-Rays and this is one of the sharpest and color rich transfers I have seen so far. I think the anticipation of fans, put an extreme expectation on perfection for this transfer, as did the studio's touting of the \\"superior\\" nature of the \\"Sapphire\\" series. And yes, I have seen several \\"reference-quality\\" BD's, like the UK Zulu which remains the best PQ I have ever seen, along with discs such as I Robot.<br /><br />There are some problems with this disc, due to over-digitization. But those scenes were few and far between, for me, and the detail, starting from the opening battle scene, down to those where Maximus is walking through the fields, and daylight shots, the clarity and detail on this disc is amazing. The DTS sound also does not disappoint, as it did not in the SD version. It is also possible that some with an LCD screen, or other brighter settings will see more of the digitization, but in Cinema Mode (my setting of choice), on a Plasma, the theater experience was replicated with true representation at home, for me.  The film remains one of my favorite films of all time, and it continues to be towards the top of my list for Drama films. The cast is at its best, and Ridley and all creative talent involved deserve every accolade bestowed upon this film.<br /><br />Regardless of what you hear from threads and reviews, give this disc a chance, at least as a rental. Whether a superior transfer is released later on,  or not, this film has never looked as good, to me, as it does in this Blu-Ray edition. PQ 4.5/5, AQ 5/5.does in this Blu-Ray edition. PQ 4.5/5, AQ 5/5.

0385504225|1.0|A very boring read, in fact the only reason I read the entire book was I kept hoping it would get better.  I wasted several hours - it never did!  There is nothing about this book that is appealing.  It's preachy, unimaginable, over the top in stretching possible scenarios and Mr. Brown was missed the mark trying to make his good characters appealing and his bad characters loathful - he didn't succeed.  He makes Langdon an idiot in this and the government agencies involved conspirators with something to cover up that could end the world as we know it.  He should have stopped with the DaVinci Code when it comes to writing about symbols and picked a different topic to write about.    Don't waste your money, (get it from the library or a used book store if you must read it because there will be many there), or your time unless you need a nap, it will put you to sleep.

B000S0GYRU|5.0|Many have said that Suspiria is the bloody mirror image of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and, to be perfectly honest, it is. An exercise in atmosphere and exploitation at the same time, Suspiria is an incredibly violent account of a ballet student who comes to a celebrated dance academy in Germany, which, ironically, is situated in The Black Forest. Well the story really takes a turn for the worst once the student, Suzy Bannon (Jessica Harper), finds out that the school is run by a coven of witches. The story is pretty thin in terms of depth, but never have I beared witness to such beautifully photographed death sequences. I know that sounds morbid, but one has to see it to believe it. What could've became violent exploitative trash turns into beautiful, Gothic cinema that unravels like an onion of bloody delight. On an educated note, the film is very well known for its use of color, and this is because it uses 3-strip Technicolor. This same process was used for The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind. Normal red turns into something of a nightmarish crimson, adding more to this violent extravaganza. A-.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great show.. if you havent seen it then check it out.. its kind of like an extension of Saving Private Ryan.. only much deeper.<br /><br />The only drawback I see with this set is its only 2 episodes per disk, and you have to sit thru all the copyright nonsense every 2 hours without being able to fast forward thru it...  and that really is the ONLY issue.<br /><br />If your thinking about it, the just do it!  Get it!

B000HIVOI2|3.0|The \\"Extended Cut\\" blu-ray turned out to actually be of less visual quality than the \\"Ultimate\\" version on DVD. It also has a very annoying security feature that tells me that I am infringing on the copyright when I try to play it though the Panasonic BD-55 to display on Vizio plasma TV without any other device between the player and the set. I examined the BD via my PC and there was no copyright issue at all, which is absurd when you have a BD burner in the system.<br /><br /> Yes, it is a movie that requires a certain lack of \\"reality\\" but it is still worth a good look. The sad thing is that the BD featured has 480p video quality and more \\"grain\\" at higher resolutions than an upconverted DVD.<br /><br /> Still, if you have a BD player and no copy of this movie in your library, a $10 price tag and a fun ride will be waiting. Just the idea of a movie based on a 10,000 year-old renegade alien who established the Egyptian civilization is fun enough but with Spader and Russell in the lead, it's still a joy.

1584282584|5.0|If you love Strobist - you'll love this! You can get \\"off camera flash\\" without taking your \\"flash off the camera\\" - all you need is to get the light to come from \\"another direction\\" than directly from the camera.  You achieve this by bouncing (using: white foam aka abetterbouncecard/index cards/walls/windows/etc) and flagging (using: black foam/hand/gobo/etc) the light from falling directly on your subject from the camera, thereby making the light look more natural (from a different direction) and softer (from a larger light source). The author provides several tips and technique tricks on how to achieve the flash-to-ambient lighting ratio you desire (fill light/key light) and that looks the best. You'll benefit greatly from reading the authors \\"neilvn tangents\\" website articles as well!    The book reads very well (I could hardly put it down) and the photos are of an exceptionally high quality.  The shots are all done with the flash in E-TTL/CLS/auto mode (with +/- FEP) and the author/photographer even reveals his \\"test\\" shots so you can see what he started with and how he compensated flash/aperture/shutter/iso to get the desired results.  While you don't necessarily need light stands, soft boxes, remote triggers and all of the rest of the \\"strobist\\" get to get these great quality shots - you do need a suitable environment for bouncing the flash and most all of these shots are \\"posed\\" to some degree that the shots are possible (aside from direct fill-flash). In addition to lots of practice, the only accessories recommended to take better flash-photography photos are: 2mm thick foam sheets (white and black)/hot-glue/velcro straps (or a rubber/hair band) all from your local craft store, flash gels to change the color temperature (at least tungsten/fluorescent), a [[ASIN:B0007DDK7A Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce for the Canon 580EX Flash]] (sized for \\"your\\" flash), and perhaps an auto/E-TTL/CLS flash cord.    The only down-side, is that I felt the book simply got repetitive about 1/2 way through it, simply showing more and more examples of the exact same general techniques in practice.  I think that is great, though it lost a little momentum. It would have been more interesting to see other new techniques.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|Truly awesome Zombie film.  The cast is excellent, great storyline, awesome special effects, great acting, lots of laughs and just an overall great film.  My fav Woody movie of all time, Bill the man Murray even graces the scene.
0385504225|2.0|When you write a book like the DaVinci Code, which I loved, it is very hard to follow and all follow ups will be judged against it.    However, this book must be judged by its own merits and not compared to Brown's prior novels.    This is slightly better than garbage, but not much.  It is not thrilling, it is contrived and way too much detail paid to people's breathing, walking, useless past and relationships.  One scene in particular, that took place in the Capitol that in \\"real time\\" probably took 30 minutes had 30% of the book describing it-on top of that it was interspersed with more useless babbling about past scenes of no or little connection to the characters or storyline.      This is a book to skim if you feel must have it.    My recommendation, don't waste your time on this garbage-slightly better than garbage that is.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|Not many remakes live up to the original but this one was very well done and had a lot better special effects than Wes Cravens film.  This remake still held all the depraved scenes and imagery that made this film great and also added more realistic and common situations that would happen today like kids going to buy drugs and ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Great film, great acting and a very well done remake.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This was an excellent fantasy film. My grandson would say it was PG 11 as it had some scary parts, but the concept and acting were above average.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Shelter was A Great Story and Well Executed Movie.  It was a type of story that could really Hit Home for a lot of People! I thought It was Wonderful! A Little Short, But I Loved every minute of it.  I Loved that it told the story from Zachs Point of View. It showed the troubles with coming to the Fact that he actually did like another person and that it Happened to be a Guy.  Also liked the fact that you could just look at those two and never even think that they would be a couple. They could actually just pass off as two Best Friends.  This Movie could Help One that is dealing with coming out like Zach is doing throughout this movie. They can Relate on the same level. Simply Wonderful! Great Ending!!     It got to my home well before the date that was set. Everything was fine with the movie. No Scratches, and Overall in Great Condition!
0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire is the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy. I was a huge fan of Hunger Games and was a little skeptical on whether this book could pull me in as much as the first book.  Well, turns out there was no need to worry - once I picked up this book I could not put it down! I don't want to give any plot points away so as not to take away from the experience of readers, but if you loved the first book this one will not disappoint.  The world that Suzanne Collins has built is unlike any other book I have read. I am looking forward to the third installment.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I won't bother commenting on the production because everyone knows it's horrible and ruins the entire album.  Now that that's out of the way, the actual songwriting on Death Magnetic is okay, if a little forced.  Unlike many other fans, I actually liked how the band matured on the Load and Reload albums, so parts of Death Magnetic sound regressive to me, as if some of the lyrics are just attempts at grasping some juvenile angst and anger.  Seriously, Cyanide?  My Apocalypse?  Come on, you guys aren't 25 anymore; don't try and be like Slayer.  Luckily, more mature lyrics can be found on songs like The End of the Line, The Unforgiven 3, The Day That Never Comes, and Broken, Beat, and Scarred.      Musically speaking, the album is quite good, with songs that are alternately ferocious, melodic, and thunderous.  Though there are frequent problems with overlength on most of the songs, it's nowhere near as bad as on St. Anger.  Kirk does some blistering solos here and there, but they aren't all that memorable.  James does a good job with the vocals as does Lars on drums (why on Earth do people bash his drumming?  If you don't like him as a person, fine, but there's nothing wrong with his drumming other than the fact that it's mixed too loud).  Rob Trujillo?  I'm pretty sure he played bass on the album, but damned if I can hear any of it.  Overall, Death Magnetic is enjoyable, though very flawed.  On their next album, I'd like the band to mellow out a bit and write songs that come a bit more naturally as opposed to try and recapture their early thrash glories.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|Selena Gomez is one of the biggest teen stars in the world, needless to say Disney knows how to pick people. Demi Lovato and Miley Cyrus are the main singers in Disney while Selena is by far the better actress of the three, but she thought it would be nice to have a singing career of her own. Its clear that she doesn't have that natural singing voice but she doesn't sound half bad. A lot of haters basically say \\"she can't sing\\", but everybody has the ability to sing, (some better than others) in my opinion if you're able to hold a note YOU can sing. The album is a mix bag, I'll just say its POP music with elements of Pop Rock, Synth Rock etc. with 12 tracks, at least they are all pretty much different. Selenas voice is very soft, and you can tell shes trying to forcefully bring it out, but as time goes on (if she decides to keep singing) she can only get better with a lot more practice/ The songs are catchy, Falling Down, Naturally and I Won't Apologize are by far the more memorable tracks. Just remember, Selena is an actress first and singer second, so give her a break with all the BS. If you're a fan of hers get the album, if you don't like her den don't get it, its as simple as that.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|It is so good to see Whitney looking healthy and happy.  This CD, however, is disappointing.  She is trying to be \\"hip\\" and she just needs to be classic Whitney.  She has a gorgeous voice and that is what people want to hear.

0123694965|5.0|I bought this book a few weeks ago with the intent of strengthening my skills in game design and programming, especially with an intent towards mobile games. In the first few pages, I was a bit disappointed, as I was hoping for something to get something more immediate in terms of how to program for games, and the book seemed to be a bit more philosophical.    As I started reading further, I realized the folly of my initial thinking and I am glad that I stuck to continue reading the book.     The book is for those who want to understand the philosophy of game design rather than quickly writing a game in some language. The lenses the author talks about are very thought-provoking and are useful even outside the realm of game design. The book essentially gives you the mindset needed for designing games, and in that aspect, is fundamental to any game designer.     If you want to have instant gratification in terms of writing a game right away, there are other books, but at some point in time, you'll find yourself wanting to come back and read this book.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Many other reviews have said what I'd say. This record emerged after Blackmore sulked and walked away, and Steve Morse has injected energy, wit, musical \\"coloring\\" and a stunning new approach to both guitar work and composition. Remembering what happened when Blackmore left the first time - a decent record but a stylistic mismatch that ended tragically with the departure and death of Tommy Bolin - I was apprehensive. I own everything DP has done in the studio, and a stack of live recordings from every incarnation. This version of the band is fantastic, and any DP fan who rejects Morse as a legitimate successor to \\"Blackers\\" simply is stuck in the past.     What's more, the follow ups \\" Abandon \\", \\" Bananas \\" and \\" Rapture Of The Deep \\" each approach the quality and luster of this one, while falling a small step short. \\"Purpendicular\\" places easily in the top 5 DP records of all time, and one of the best hard rock records of the 90's IMHO.     DP is not a band living in the past. They are kicking asses and taking names with superb original music well into the 21st century, and we rock fans from back in the day are better off...way better off...because they refuse to give up the ghost.
B002AEB8P0|5.0|This CD is a great mix of ballads, beautiful violin, and more pop-style music. Fairytales--the name of the CD and one of its songs, is what got Alexander first place in the Eurovision concert in Moscow 2009. Alexander, at only 23 wrote the words and the melody and performed the song with his violin and his own singing. He is very talented and exhibits his beautiful voice and amazing violin playing skills in every song.     Kiss and Tell and Roll with the Wind have a little more beat and are similar to Fairytales (to my untrained ear, at least). Funny Little World, Abandoned, and Horses are more of ballads and have beautiful words and music.     The last 2 bonus tracks are instrumentals and very well played. Anyone who likes Fairytales will LOVE the rest of this CD, each of the songs is beautiful and there are no fluffy filler songs.
B00000F7MS|5.0|Another great movie for my Grandchildren. they watch it over and over. Disney old classics are the best!
B002KVSJ64|5.0|Phobia was an exceptional album that took had both soulful and rock out music.  After such a successful album it is hard not to expect more of the same.  Breaking Benjamin does not dissappoint.  A fan from the beginning I am happy that years later they are still growing and expanding their music.  Many of the complaints I see of the other ablums is the what they thing of as \\"slow music\\".  I would argue that those are the soul of albums like Phobia.  If you want Saturate over and over then listen to Saturate over and over.  Who can listen to Here We Are's words and not get a tingle?  The high and low of that song is great.  This album holds more of the same combination of rock your socks off and insightful.  The first single \\"I Will not Bow\\" is a proof enough that Breaking Benjamin still has it.  Benjamin Burley's voice seems to have gotten stronger with each album and the way he stretches his limits is something I personally find exciting.  Dear Agony is a great addition to Breaking Benjamin collections everywhere.
0977476073|2.0|I'm suspicious of the Ford translation. First, Michael Ford is his own publisher. That means that no one besides himself stands behind the book.  I've looked over Ford's accompanying justification for his translation, which is poorly copy edited, and not all that well written. More than that, Ford gives little indication of his expertise on the subject. And he regularly claims to have the \\"correct\\" translation, even when he's wrong. Here are three of a number of possible examples: He takes this German text: \\"Sang- und klanglos zog Herr Cuno zurück...\\" and translates it as \\"While singing and soundless [without a whimper], Herr Cuno...\\" It literally says \\"song-less and soundless,\\" not \\"singing and soundless.\\" Then he wants to translate the Nazi Party's official newspaper, the  \\"Völkischer Beobachter,\\" as \\"Race Watcher,\\" which is a rather curious translation that, as best I can determine, no one with scholarly credentials has ever used. A third example.  He confidently asserts that the German \\"Vereinsabende\\" should be translated as \\"night clubs,\\" not as Manheim does, \\"club evenings.\\"  If you happen to know a native speaker of German, ask him or her about that translation.  After they stop chuckling, they'll tell you that Manheim is correct.    In a very few cases I checked, his translation is in fact better than some of the alternatives (though most of his comparisons are to translations other than Manheim's), but this will not become the \\"standard\\" translation. There is a reason why books subject to peer review are better than ones that are not so reviewed, and  since publishers like \\"Elite Minds, Inc.\\" do not take the trouble to provide any editorial review, there is no assurance of quality or accuracy.      Ralph Manheim, on the other hand, has by far the best translation.  He is an internationally famed translator.  After he died, the PEN Club named their prestigious translation award after him.  If I have a choice between an internationally respected translatorand Mr. Ford, I will take Ralph Manheim. I recommend that you do the same.    [UPDATE]:  Since Ford is publishing on demand, he's fixed most of the errors I've pointed out here and elsewhere -- but there remain more.  It's also interesting that, although the book has been out for over a year, it has not been reviewed anywhere that I have seen, nor has anyone with any scholarly standing had anything at all to say about the book. Mr. Ford has claimed various scholars like the book, but that he is \\"too polite\\" to quote them.
0670033049|5.0|East of Eden is one of my favorite books. Most of the book takes place in the farmland of the Salinas Valley in northern California.   It's a big book and has lots of characters but the main characters are Adam Trask and his twin sons Aaron and Caleb.  Adam is a good man but sometimes very simpleminded.  He sees things black and white and can be stubborn.  His two sons are complete opposites.  Since Aaron does what his father wants, he's Adam's favorite.  Caleb, or Cal, can't do anything right in his father's eyes and so tries hard to win his love.       My favorite part of this book is how personal Steinbeck makes it.  He doesn't just talk about the Trask family; he also spends a lot of time telling about his mother's family.  It makes it seem like the story he's telling could be real, or at least it's rooted in his family history.  The first time I read it made me wonder what my neighbors were up to and what type of stories they were hiding.     As much as I like the book, I wish there was more about the Chinese servant Lee.  Lee would go into Chinatown in San Francisco and it made me want to know what happened there.     I would recommend this book to people who like well told stories about the problems families create for themselves.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I have absolutely loved the new Metallica album. I had a friend who said to not get it, but I should have known better than to listen to him. I don't think I have found a song on this album that I didn't like.
055380684X|5.0|Talent code is strikingly informative and an excellent read to boot. If you've ever wondered why perfect practice makes perfect, and you've been curious about how to apply the idea behind that aphorism pragmatically, then this book is for you - It's an excellent, entertaining resource regardless of your profession, personal interest, or agenda.<br /><br />I'm a slow reader and, on top of that, I get bored quickly. As a result, I rarely finish books. However, Talent Code held my attention and it called me to pick it first; that is, before any of the other four books I happen to be reading at the moment. My good Twitter friend @interrante recommended it to me as the best book of '09. He's an avid, discerning reader so I was definitely intrigued.<br /><br />To be sure, I was not disappointed. It was a good use of my time and my life is a little richer because of it.<br /><br />In the end, this is a book I'll keep on my bookshelf. I'm glad I bought the hardcopy.<br /><br />Enjoy reading.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I am not going to review the music and the remastering is superb. I am having disk authoring problems and have not seen any other reports. I am on my 3rd purchase of the remastered Beatles White Album. Whoever is in control of the quality control of CD manufacturing for the US market is not doing their job. Every copy I tried has the same defect. At the 3:24 mark of the song Revolution 1, it hits 3:24 twice, giving the song a third beat at that point. I am surprised no one else has reported this. I have been listening to this album for over 40 years so I immediately heard the error.    I checked with a friend that bought the stereo box and he doesn't have the problem. Maybe it is only on the single releases.
0385504225|1.0|I bought this for my Kindle despite the reviews. I am glad I only spent $10.00. Much too long, too much mysticism. The entire last chapter was a waste. Had hoped  for so much more. I tend to ignore reviews and  make my own judgment. I will likely tell my wife that I would not wast my time if I were her.
0061719544|5.0|I'll admit upfront that I am a big fan of Craig Ferguson, he has a certain manic brilliance that I find to be very funny.    This book isn't all that funny as Craig is brutally honest about himself and how he has impacted people through his life.  I've had family members with addiction issues and I believe Craig when he says you really don't know addiction unless you are an addict.    Craig talks about his struggles with drugs and alcohol and not in a glamorous way.  When you read what he had been through, it's amazing that he was able to go through rehab and start to change his life.    When I got done with the book, I was left with an understanding of exactly how human and talented Craig is.  This is not a kiss and tell book, Craig is very kind to the people he writes about.  Instead, we learn about is inner daemons and how they impacted others.    Excellent read, I only wish it was a little longer.  There are so many people and events in the book that I would have liked more time spent on them.
B002GMNLLA|5.0|If you are a die-hard Insomnium fan, you will not be disappointed.  This is what I expect an Insomnium record to sound like.  However, there is one clear difference-there are a lot more clean vocals on this album than any other album (but still not a lot).  Overall, the album is very good, but will probably rank low on my list of favorite Insomnium albums.  There are no songs that really stand out (though they are all good) amongst the other Insomnium songs (I have all their albums).  Lay of the Autumn, the longest song on the album, sounds very much like Opeth to me (I like Opeth, but not nearly as much as Insomnium) and has a great deal of clean vocals ... oddly enough it is probably my favorite song on the album.    Even in its \\"plainness\\" this is still definitely an album worth getting if you like Insomnium.
0385504225|1.0|OK - this is my first time reviewing a book, but The Lost Symbol is so bad it merits some remarks.  I think the best way to sum up the book is that I kept waiting to read that stating the phrase \\"Ice Cream Sundae\\" is really a code for people who are excited to go to church: \\"I Scream Sunday\\".  In other words, Dan Brown finds the craziest explanations he can find for Chritian ideals and passes them off as obvious fact.  If you are looking for a book that is about 150 pages too long, makes fun of anyone who believes in a specific deity (especially Christians), and whose plot is entirely predictable, then I highly recommend this book.
B00009Z574|5.0|By far the best Yes album.  The first and only time all the details came together for them.  If you listen, this album will stay in your mind.  Listen to it while falling asleep and it will stay in your subconscious.  I own thousands of titles.  I have been collecting for 30 years.  I listen to this album or CD 20 to 30 times a year. It refreshes my spirit.  Now I have to buy the remastered version with extra tracks. I listened again today, WOW.   Pelmania

B0017V7GTY|5.0|If Social Distortion met The Strokes and invited over the Kings of Leon where they jammed out to Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty all night, you just might have an idea of what you're going to hear when you drop the needle on \\"The '59 Sound\\" by the Gaslight Anthem.  From the very moment Great Expectations kicks in, you know you are in for something special.  The next two songs only help to further that notion, and by the time you get to the Counting Crows references on the fourth track (\\"High Lonesome\\"), you know you're hearing a potentially life changing record.  That's a feeling I haven't had in a very very long time, and truth be told, I didn't know if I would ever have it again.  Now whether or not this is that kind of album remains to be seen, but it certainly has the potential. Every song is good if not great, and often the songs on this record transition seamlessly into each other, such as when \\"Miles Davis & The Cool\\" crashes right into \\"The Patient Ferris Wheel\\", which features guest vocals by Dicky F'n Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.      \\"The '59 Sound\\" sounds like a tribute to all of the bands that The Gaslight Anthem enjoys from another generation.  There are obvious hints throughout the record of Tom Petty and especially Bruce Springsteen, and even Creedence Clearwater Revival (\\"Casanova Baby\\" starts off suspiciously similar to \\"Looking Out My Back Door\\").  Even the titles of the songs (\\"Meet Me by The River's Edge\\", \\"Old White Lincoln\\")  sound like something you'd see on the back of a record from your mom or dad's vinyl collection.      \\"The '59 Sound\\" is ultimately one of those unique albums where you feel sort of torn.  One part of you wants to call up everyone you know and tell them to go buy it.  Another part of you wants to keep it for yourself.  In the end, it's an album that you can enjoy by yourself driving down the highway with the windows down, or with a car full of friends singing along at the top of your lungs down that very same road.  That's what makes records like \\"The '59 Sound\\" so special.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

0307341550|5.0|Camille Preaker, institutionalized as a teen for self-mutilation, now works for a second class Chicago newspaper. When a girl is murdered and another disappears in Camille's hometown of Wind Gap, Missouri, her editor sends her there for a human-interest story. The police, including Richard Willis, a criminal profiler from Kansas City, Missouri, say they suspect a transient but Camille thinks the killer is local. While interviewing old acquaintances, she relives her disturbed childhood and uncovers her family secrets are as horrible as her scars.<br /><br />I enjoyed Sharp Objects as much as I enjoyed Dark Places; Gillian Flynn is an excellent author. Flynn includes misdirection that keeps the reader guessing as the story progresses. I look forward to reading any more books Gillian Flynn writes in the future.

0385504225|1.0|I'm about halfway through The Lost Symbol.  Usually when I am at this point in reading a good book, I look forward to my next opportunity to continue the story.  But that, unfortunately, is not the case with The Lost Symbol.  In fact, I'm not sure that I am going to invest the time that it will take to finish this turkey.    One of the first things that normally hook me into a good mystery/thriller novel is plausibility.  If the plot elements are at least logical and possible, then I can immerse myself into the story and have a good time.  But on this main point, The Lost Symbol falls flat.    One of the first scenes in this novel takes place in the Capitol, where a severed hand is discovered on the floor of the rotunda.  Logically, you might think that the Capitol police would now consider the rotunda to be a crime scene, that they would block all the exits and call in forensics teams to gather evidence.  Well, you would be wrong.    The sinister director of an internal CIA investigative branch comes in, pulls rank on the Capitol police and takes over all aspects of the investigation concerning the severed hand.  That's in one of the set-up scenes of this novel, and that's where Dan Brown lost my interest.  Here's why.    I worked for the federal government for 35 years, and I can tell you with certainty that the Capitol police would never have allowed anyone from the CIA to interfere in a crime scene in the Capitol.  And, the CIA certainly has no rank to pull to get the Capitol police to do anything.    The CIA is prohibited by law from conducting operations within the borders of the United States, and it certainly has no police powers within the Capitol.  That is common knowledge, and is certainly well known to the Capitol police.  If a CIA director had tried something like a takeover of a Capitol police investigation, every CIA person involved would have been immediately arrested by the Capitol police or the FBI.  Believe me, the Capitol police are accustomed todealing with powerful people and their powerful egos, because they do it every day.    Dan Brown has used this CIA takeover of the investigation as such a key element of his story that I just can't get past it.  It makes the rest of the plot look completely ridiculous.    This book makes me angry.  Angry that I wasted time and money on it, and angry because Dan Brown could have done so much better.  I really enjoyed DaVinci, as well as Angels.  But, The Lost Symbol is a lost cause.
B002LVVCIK|4.0|After several books and movies, the verdict is finally in on Michael Moore: He stirs up the pot, pitches a \\"one man hissy fit,\\" jumping up and down for media attention like the signifying monkey, and then laughs all the way to the bank as he moves on to the next moneymaking project.<br /><br />With \\"Roger Rabbit,\\" that warned about the impending Detroit meltdown, which occurred on schedule as he had predicted: no one in the U.S. moved a muscle and we all watched Detroit sink to the bottom of lake Michigan. In \\"Bowling with Columbine,\\" where with great skill (if lacking subtlety and finesse), he exposed the machination of the gun merchants and their protectors the heavy-handed gun lobbyists. One thought there would be a great national outcry and a final serious move against the gun lobbyists and the weak kneed Congress that continues to cower under their threats, yet not a peek out of the still comatose American public. Then, just as our senior citizens were chartering caravans of buses across the border into Canada to purchase the same drugs being charged ten times as much to them in the U.S., came \\"Sicko:\\" a devastating critique of the \\"sickness for profit\\" system (that we call our national healthcare system), but again, not a solitary growl from the sleeping giant known as the American public?<br /><br />Now we have \\"Capitalism: A Love Story,\\" perhaps the renegade filmmaker's best yet. It is a documentary about how both our present President and Congress are \\"wholly owned subsidiaries\\" of Goldman and Sachs, and about how the Congress and the last President hijacked the economy under a false scare that they themselves had conjured up (with \\"credit default swaps\\" and other nonsensical financial derivatives). This carefully engineered economic meltdown was only different in scope from the ones they had engineered about a decade before: first in the Keating-McCain scandal and then in the Burt Lance-Jimmy Carter BCCI scandal.<br /><br />It was also about now they and their lobbyist's friends continue to screw the nation in both the front (with the Obama bailout) and in the rear (with offshore tax dodges, insurance policies on employees, tax cuts obscene salaries and golden parachutes for themselves but low wages for everyone else, outsourcing, etc.) but all in the name of all our most cherished patriotic symbols. Never has there been a more thorough and devastating critique of the way the American middle class, the American farmer, and the American homeowner, have been screwed by the greedy money-hungry \\"drive-by\\" criminals running the Congress and Wall Street. Yet, I am going to go out on a limb and predict that nothing will happen as a result of this fine film, either.<br /><br />Why is it the case that when Michael Moore tells the unvarnished truth about what is happening right before our own eyes, no one seems to care? It can't just be that they don't like Moore's brand of politics, because the nation is divided right down the middle between liberals and conservatives (excuse me, between \\"progressives\\" and conservatives), so that can't be the underlying reason. It also can't be that Michael is just another capitalist himself with a capital \\"C.\\" The movie (and Moore) avowedly are not against capitalism, just against the kind of \\"vampire capitalism\\" and unregulated \\"casino capitalism\\" being perpetrated against the American people today by the Wall Street crowd.<br /><br />I believe the reason goes much deeper and suggests that we are now \\"in a fix\\" we may never be able to extricate ourselves from.<br /><br />The grid of parallel fault lines making up the sectors that divide the country have now been Balkanized to the max. There are no more ways remaining by which we further can be divided as a people. As a result, the U.S. has become virtually ungovernable. And this is exactly what the greedy criminal Plutocrats (with their Congressional and Presidential lap dogs) have been angling towards, since FDR's New Deal. They have achieved their goal. There is no longer a \\"common good,\\" only \\"special interests.\\" And whose interests are the most special of all? Guess? All the real democrats (little \\"D\\") hate each other's guts and would rather see the country fall they yield one narrow ideological point to another side. All the Balkanized sectors are at right angles to each other. There is no overlap. It's a multidimensional zero-sum game in every direction.<br /><br />That basically is where our democracy is today, and that's very sad. In the mean time, we elected Obama as the change candidate (that is to say, we elected him only to get rid of the village idiot) and he has distinguished himself by showing us how to \\"duck and dodge\\" all of the issues that divide us. What else can the poor guy do, become a real leader, god forbid? Did we forget, that that is not what he promised, he didn't promise leadership, just change. Well, how does that saying go: If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, smells like a duck, and ducks like a duck, it is, as Reverend Wright said: Just another Chicago politician. But as Hillary reminded us, he can give a good speech? I am beginning to dislike Obama as much as I disliked Bush, and I am a black man.<br /><br />Oh, we already know what will happen should \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" begin to really threaten to gain traction. The Plutocrats will circle the wagons and roll out their first line of defense, the racist rightwing media pundits like Limbaugh, Beck and Dobbs. Should the concerned and aware American public then began to wake up and see through this emotional smoke screen (which they rarely do) there still will be graft to spread around like cow manure to our \\"morally challenged\\" Congressmen, most of whom have yet to see a bag of money or a campaign contribution they could refuse. As a last resort, they will saturate the executive office with a revolving door list of \\"who's Who\\" in the world of how to screw the American people. And failing that, they can always find somewhere else to start another false war of necessity.<br /><br />Unless we get up off our duffs, and Obama starts showing some real leadership, we are definitely looking at a one-term Obama Presidency, and then four years of another conservative village idiot, maybe even Sarah Palin. Jesus, please deliver me from this mess? Four stars
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I was worried about this before seeing it.  I just didn't want a depressing ending...I was in no mood.  I was so surprised.  No warm & gooey, happily-ever-after wrap up, but real & satisfying.  I loved the characters & loved the script.  My favorite part is the, sort of dream-like, walk to work scene...priceless.  See this one.  You will not be disappointed.
B001993Y2C|1.0|Considering the high price tag, this box set should have at least included episode guides that tell which episodes are on which DVDs. The series is terrific, but the packaging is a disaster. For this lofty price, customers should not have to guess what content each individual DVD might contain. I am not planning to buy DVDs for Univeral shows in the future. I prefer companies that can manage to somehow list the content of each DVD. It cannot be that difficult. Every other television series that I have purchased manages to do so. As much as I love the show, this hideous packaging ruined the box set for me. The DVDs are also packaged poorly in cheap cardboard boxes. The show itself deserves five stars, but I recommend avoiding this disappointing box set.
0743496736|5.0|Another winner from Picoult!  An interesting look into the social workings for an American high school.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|Great cast, bad story editing.  The writers/studio kept in most of the major plot points from the novel and sacrificed characterization and motivation (and believable solutions to crimes) to keep the movie under 2 hours.  Big mistake.  Important characters remain one-dimensional, ancillary crimes remain unsolved and--by the writers/filmmakers, at least--forgotten, and the lead character, Robicheaux, exists on two planes: violence and cynicism.  In the novel, the characters are fully realized, interesting, believable.  But every character in this movie--through  no fault of the actors--seems little more than a plot device.  Watching this movie, you get the feeling that at some point it was an excellent three hour movie, but that studio suits got hold of it and bled it out. Someone needs to tell them that you can't fit an entire novel into a 100 minute movie. You'd think that would be obvious by now.
141654917X|5.0|I've read almost all of Picoult's book, and this one - which was my first - remains my favorite!  I didn't even see the recent motion picture, as I heard they changed one of the major events in the book.  Stick with the book!!
B002REZQP6|5.0|As \\"Instinct\\" begins, the viewer is quickly asked to take his suspension of disbelief (in that people's minds can be wiped and replaced), and elevate it further to accept that certain coding in an imprint can affect glandular responses in the imprinted, but then shore it up with the reassurance that an existing mind cannot successfully be altered (the terrific Van Halen analogy).  Mind does win over matter, it seems.  After this opening scene, the entire first act shows us the reality of Echo's imprint: she is a wife and mother whose husband has suddenly started acting peculiar.  Other reviewers have pointed out that this feels like a horror movie and I believe that's exactly how Eliza Dushku wanted to play it.<br /><br />Alexis Denisof then returns as the politician gunning to take down Rossum, the parent corporation of the Dollhouse.  This series tells the story from the point of view of the undying Big Bad and feels already like the Hero will be the one changing each season.  Last season's Agent Ballard has been replaced by this season's Senator Perrin.  Will Alpha be the show's Racer X once again?  As in the previous season, paranoia for us viewers sets in early and I'm wondering if Mrs. Perrin is another Active, maybe Juliet?  Perhaps the handler came to the door and gave her misleading information from the Dollhouse; perhaps it was Alpha with legitimate insider info.<br /><br />We cut to Miracle Laurie reprising her layered role of Madeline/Mellie/November and at first I was disappointed in her sedate delivery.  But later in the episode we are given reason to believe that perhaps her emotions have been purposely diminished at her own request.  Here, though, we begin to see more of the multiply interpretable dialogue that characterizes a Joss show.<br /><br />The scene where we return to Echo as Emily Jordan feels like part of a law and order procedural, but that's exactly what Echo thinks is happening. After the break, Mr. Jordan's take on events is jarring as it drives home once more that Emily Jordan is wrong in every way since she isn't real.  The explanations are a bit heavy-handed here, but it helps to bring new viewers up to speed.  Sandwiching this segment before another scene that includes Emily speaking with a police woman in complete earnest about her troubles keeps the perspectives spinning.  The police believe Emily because she is telling the whole truth as she knows it, which sadly has as much to do with reality as the testimony of a dissociative personality.<br /><br />A brief respite from tension arrives in the form of the amusing diagnostic that Fran Kranz's Topher performs on Madeline.  Even here, though, we are given clues about the events that will unfold between the present and Epitaph One.  Topher's amusing use of iPhone-popularized \\"Apps\\" in an offer for personality enhancement is troubling both if Madeline's personality is whole and he was lying about Van Halen or if November herself is still an Active operating under an imprint.  When Ballard busts into the scene, several more important facts are revealed: Dr. Saunders is still gone, Madeline doesn't seem to remember any of her Active time, Ballard now learns of a reasonable circumstance for someone volunteering to become an Active, and Madeline is satisfied that she's not sad.  Now I begin to wonder if Madeline will experience a parallel to Echo's memory leaks, except the imprint memories might then be spilling into the mind of a real person instead of a Doll.<br /><br />Echo's behavior after her wipe totally startled me even though I thought something like that could happen.  It's just nice when a show can do that.<br /><br />Who was Senator Perrin's mother and what happened to her? What name was he given? There's no time to waste in a 13-episode order, so the arc has to move forward constantly even if it can only be done in these disconnected scenes. I kinda hope Alyson Hannigan guest stars as an Active sent to seduce Senator Perrin (since Alyand Alexis are married in real life).<br /><br />As Echo escapes, the juxtaposition of the ominous soundtrack and her clueless approach to driving made me laugh unexpectedly. Then Topher's dialogue with Ballard starting at his \\"genius\\" comment kept the humor going all the way through \\"...lactation was a bridge too far.  Live and learn.\\" Here, though, we reconsider if Matter wins over Mind after all.  And if Matter = body, then we have the premise of the whole series recapitulated.  Plus, Topher goes too far.<br /><br />The final Horror movie scene plays out predictably but with the twist that this now mindless Doll is feeling love and possessiveness as a residual effect of the glandular changes from her imprint.  In the end, the viewer is corrected along with Ballard in the explanation that Echo retains the feelings rather then the memories of her experiences.  And Echo, unlike Madeline, would rather feel sad than nothing at all.  In her final words, she provides us with the suggestion that there is a connection between sentience and emotional awareness.<br /><br />C'mon, this is badass!  I am a huge fan of this show!and Alexis are married in real life).<br /><br />As Echo escapes, the juxtaposition of the ominous soundtrack and her clueless approach to driving made me laugh unexpectedly.

0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown and the publishers should be embarrassed...this was one of the STUPIDEST and frankly DISAPPOINTING books I've ever read.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.<br /><br />I don't normally write reviews on Amazon, but I was so disappointed and upset at how bad this book was that I felt compelled to write one (NOTE: a couple of spoilers in here, so if you do want to waste your money and read this book anyway, be aware that I have to mention a few points in here).<br /><br />The book was completely over-hyped, and it feels like I've wasted hours and hours of my time having read it.  Can I request a refund?<br /><br />Dan Brown's previous books have been riveting and well thought out...this one was NOT.<br /><br />It starts out with mysterious teasers to get you hooked, but you only keep reading with the HOPE that it will get better, and have some kind of twist or other excitement....but it doesn't get any better.  In fact, it gets progressively worse, with the quarter of the book being simply idiotic.  The ending is about as lame and disappointing as it could be (and was frankly a cop out).  If I had known how stupid the ending was, I would have stopped reading mid-way through.<br /><br />The characters are all complete caricatures (e.g., an evil genius who tattoos his entire body by himself, but covers himself with makeup that nobody can detect, except to think it's an artificial tan), and they completely  unsympathetic.

And having spent hours \\"dead\\" in this fluid, Langdon can still run around afterwards like a superhero and \\"solve\\" the \\"hidden mystery\\"?

0385504225|3.0|First, the interesting parts. I found the details about things like Noetic Science and the history of Freemasonry as well as the notable characteristics of Washington DC landmarks quite intriguing. Enough to encourage me to do a bit of research to determine how much of Brown's information is factual. That's my idea of fun.     Overall, the book is well paced with a promising premise. Brown is a good writer, but not a great one so I got just about what I was expecting...three stars worth of entertainment. Even though I figured  out the secret location early on, I still enjoyed the riddle. I actually liked Lost Symbol more than DaVinci, but I prefer Angels and Demons to both.       As for some of the more annoying parts, of which there were several, the most puzzling for me was trying to figure out what would be so earth-shakingly devastating about a mad-man releasing video of some Masons running around in contumes, re-inacting a death ritual, that if not for CIA intervention, said video would be the end of civil society as we know it? Erm...not exactly.     Secondly, I could have done without the cartoonish portrayal of Sato and Mal'akh. For a minute there I thought I was reading an Xmen comic, sheesh!     Third, I think it's pretty common knowledge that the CIA is prohibited from conducting domestic operations and surely the Capitol Police would have known this. Using the FBI or even the Dept. of Homeland Security would've made more sense.     Finally there's the issue of thinly drawn characters and lack of realism in their dialogue. I would argue that an author could probably get away with one or the other of these flaws, but not both. By the time I reached the conclusion I scarcely cared what happened to any of the people in the story. Here we have three people who have supposedly just endured a physically, mentally and emotionally harrowing turn of events in rapid succession and nobody even so much as requests a glass of water and a tylenol? Instead, they just continue expounding esoteric philosophies to one another as if standing in a lecture hall without a care in the world? Would it have killed the author to give his characters a few hours or perhaps a day or so to recover?     All told, I have no regrets. It was a bit of fun, it's just that nagging feeling that this book could've been a lot better.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I read all the negative reviews, and I don't think that these people have listened to the new remastered CDs using  great set of headphones and compare side by side, each individual song. I did and I could tell that some songs have a great improvement, some sound just 10% better. Over all I think it was a great job!     But the major thing, is the release all the early albums in stereo.  I think the producers made a big mistake releasing the early CDs in MONO. I was shocked finding out that there is no Stereo available. I read that producers wanted to replicate how it sounded on the crappy one speaker radio in early 60 ties. Excuse me...? if I wanted to replicate the sound in MONO radio, I can easily do it with my $3,000 home stereo. I would knock all my highs, bass, and make and set my AMP to mono! They should have given me the choice! I had stereo LPs and they sounded much better, that's why I never bother of buying the MONO version of Beatles. I hear all the instruments, as before it was a mixed sound coming from a box.    Some people remarks was, that record company are milking us, so my answer is: \\"Don't buy it\\". If you think that there is hardly any improvement, please keep what you have and stop complaining.    The conclusion: It was worth it for me to wait 20 years and to get the stereo version plus remastered. I am still puzzled why would they have the MONO box set version. I think its made for Beatles fanatics, who buy almost anything.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|Buy this album.  The melodies and stories he tells are fantastic.  Although he is not playing long, drawn out guitar solos, I don't miss them at all.  The musicianship on this album is amazing.  Mark Knopfler is one of a very few artists that I buy their music immediately without having first heard it on the radio.  No fear, one of the best albums of the year.
0385504225|4.0|Been reading some reviews and it seems like the hunt for Dan Brown is on?    This isn't a perfect book in any way but it is a worthy followup to the Da Vinci code.  He uses the same style, the same type of action etc etc.    So bascially, if you liked the Da Vinci code you will like this, not much have changed.    The big letdown for me in the book was the explanation of the CIA's interest in it all.  He simply couldn't conjure something worthwhile there, but it's just a sidestory so I shrugged it off.    The most interesting part of the book is actually the last chapter where he sums everything up.  The action is already done and handled, so this is mostly a recap chapter.  In it he shares views that will create heavy collisions with people who considers the bible to be untouchable.  I'm wondering if this is part of why some people are so upset, his views are a rather heavy kidneyblow to lots of christians?    I've read parts of those ideas in other places as well, it strikes me that he has been inspired by someone for those ideas though?  I Wonder who?
0375703764|5.0|This novel is about a book about a film about a house... and if that sounds confusing, wait until you dive into it. This book is certainly not for everyone, and I don't doubt many a casual reader will quickly become frustrated and give up early on. It's their loss, however.<br /><br />This is easily one of the most unusual tomes I have ever cracked. The formatting alone is distinctive, and while confusing it effectively mirrors the confusion and disorientation experienced by the characters. The plots are also interesting, though the multiple levels of narration often make it a challenge to get through. Parts of this book are (intentionally) tedious and pretentious, though that is a mimicking of the material it parodies. Other segments are riveting.<br /><br />This strikes me as what would happen if you took books by H.P. Lovecraft, Thomas Pynchon, and Umberto Eco, threw them in a blender, and made a collage out of the results. Like I said, this is not for everyone, but if you're willing to invest the effort, you will almost certainly find it rewarding.
0385504225|1.0|I've read all of Dan Brown's book. Got it as a pre-order on my Kindle.  I don't think I'll ever finish it.  Nasty stuff that was so unnecessary, too long, too boring.  I loved the stuff about the Masons - because that is a family thing, but that wasn't enough to make this a worth while read.  I think someone must have given this man poor advice.  I think I'll go back and re-read one of his earlier ones.

B000000OMB|3.0|This album had the leading edge for Asia, and brought the haunting vocals, and electric edged rock to the public. The downside is that in spite of huge talent Asia could not put together a great album. The band was destined to cast about scattered songs that showed their rock soul, left the fans wanting. This is exactly how I felt listening to this album again......wanting more. The popular \\"Here Comes That Feeling\\" was a stamp of good things to come  , but Asia failed to deliver, on this album, and those to come. I felt the same let down I felt when the album first came out, not enough. Bottom line skip this album, and buy the greatest hit CD, and be done. Asia was a great band that never was, and we all knew that then, and will relive that when we fire up Asia now
B002HNA95E|1.0|A rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with. I will keep my money, I need it a lot more than Madonna needs it!<br />Thanks though! Listening to the songs on amazon.com was more than enough.
B002GZQYMK|3.0|I respect the attempt Muse made more than I enjoy the finished product.  Hooks are not critical for song craftsmanship, but Muse have done a more than respectable job by inserting this feature into their previous records. Good luck finding many memorable tunes here though. The album starts off exceptionally well with the first 2 tracks, but they are deceptive to the overall direction.  By the time track 6 rolls around, up through the remainder of the album, the band seems to be drifting around in some haze that just doesn't seem to translate well.  Don't get me wrong, I love the blending of classical and alternative, spaced out opera stuff Muse specializes in.  But it just didn't gel this time around.
B002H1MCY2|5.0|This was a great film to watch.  It teaches about life and death in no way possible.  The film even carries a bit of light comedy to balance the drama.  In addition the score was absolutely rich and intoxicating.  The special features were fun to watch and informed.  Must own!

B000N4SHPS|5.0|I have always been a fan of the first two Rocky films, as they portrayed a more realistic story.  Rocky III, IV, and V were only  for commercial purpose and as such lost the spirit of the original two.  Now with Rocky Balboa we can enjoy one last time the original character and story.  I now view the Rocky franchise as a trilogy of Rocky I,II and Rocky Balboa/III.    On the whole a well written and touching story about life and the pains of this world.  We not only sympathize with the title character, but all other minor roles.  His son trying to make it on his own, the single insecure mother, Pauly and his guilt, and Mason the champion.  This movie has it all. Good job!!!
1592802974|5.0|I'm having a great time reading Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager. It ranks right up there as one of the most interesting market books ever written. While each trader has his own peculiarities, there are some interesting common themes. I like to compare my own methods with what these wizards are doing, it gives me a way of rating what I'm doing against the very best. Early in the game I had the impression that LTBH was the \\"proper\\" way to invest. With each passing day I'm more convinced that LTBH is a way for the big guys to convince little guys to buy, hold and cherish what they want to sell to you, a.k.a. \\"distribution.\\" The big guys need someone (you) on the other side of the trade!    The book most often recommended by the wizards themselves is \\"[[ASIN:0471770884 Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)]].\\" There is a lot to be learned by listening to seasoned and successful practitioners. By providing transcripts of the interviews, the reader can get a lot closer to the wizards than if Jack Schwager had added more editorial input.    The only interview which I found boring and skipped after a page or so was the one with the psychologyst, Dr. Van K. Tharp. Listening to the traders themselves is much more instructive.

B000BT97AO|2.0|I've been dinged for reviewing movies I don't like. I will say at the outset that this is not my kind of movie. It's in my house because my daughter was curious about it. I offer this review to guys who are facing the prospect of having it in their houses and are wondering if they should schedule a bowling night when it gets played.    Do it. Your eleven-to-sixteen year old daughter will probably be enthralled by this movie. Your wife will find meaning in the symbolism and remember her own adolescence. You, however, will be left staring at well crafted, wildly disjoint, frequently ambiguous images, while listening to dialog that demands to be taken as Meaningful, but only occasionally rises above Banal. You will spend the whole movie wondering if it's ever going to attempt a linear plot or tell an actual story. Worst of all, you know exactly how it's going to turn out, 20 minutes into the film, and all that's left is the self-indulgent, meandering journey to the inevitable ending. It feels like an art project gone out of control.    There are positives. The art is bizarre, intricate and impressive, if sometimes overdone to the point of chaos. None of the acting was bad and the main character was engaging and very well done. There are touches of humor. It's certainly not lacking in quirk or imagination. But unless you find a morality play about a 15 year old girl who ultimately decides to stop being an ass, and grow up a little, fascinating, you're going to spent a lot of time looking at your watch.    I thought Coraline was a bit like this as well - decently crafted, but so awash in symbolism and so wrapped up in its own artfulness that in the end, I tuned out. If you're the sort that thought Coraline was fantastic, but you wish it had been a lot more surreal and bizarre, this is the movie you've been hoping for. Parts of this felt like Yellow Submarine on acid, that's about the warmest praise I can come up with.
0385504225|3.0|I finished reading The Lost Symbol some time mid last week and it took me a good two weeks to finish.  This statement alone shows that this particular novel had some slow dragging moments because when I read Angels and Demons (In mass-market paperback) I read it in seven days and it had 710 pages.  Although the idea of Ancient Mysteries and Free Masonry sounds like a good topic to tackle, I don't think it was the most exciting topic.  At times, I found myself asking \\"Why are they going through all this stress with cracking symbols?\\"  I think the problem was that what they were trying to uncover wasn't as exciting as the two previous books.  Da Vinci Code was centered around discovering the Holy Grail and Angels & Demons was about rescuing cardinals from horrific murders  along the ancient path of illumination and finding the anti-matter that threatens to destroy the Vatican.  These topics were thrilling and big page turners.  The whole thing with the Masonic Pyramid was fun at first but later became boring.  Also, I was getting confused how they mentioned 'The Lost Word' when the book is entitled 'The Lost Symbol.'  Overall, the book was ok and I still remain a Dan Brown reader, but I think it's prior two novels were much better  (ANGELS & DEMONS is still #1 in my book).
0385504225|2.0|After enjoying everything that Dan Brown has written to this point, I looked forward to the day that Lost Symbol would be available.  I bought it on the first day and after 3 weeks, I still have a few pages left.  It has not kept my attention or been the engaging, can't-wait-to-see-what-happens-next book that I expected.  In fact, I have not enjoyed it much at all.  It was clearly well researched but aside from that, it lacks the twisting plot and thriller suspension of his previous efforts. Dan, don't force out a book just to publish another one.
1582701709|4.0|There is really nothing new about the Secret. Even the author would be the first to tell you that.  What it does do, is it is a good jumping off place to find out about other authors such as Wallace Wattles, Emmerson and Einstein, etc.  It also puts in your mind a sort of brand recognition to other authors who are very good at conveying this sort of thing. Such as Jack Canfield, Hale Dwoskin, Lisa Nichols, James Arthur Ray, Dr. Michael Bernard Beckwith, Joe Vitale, etc.<br /><br />Most of these people have their own works and not a single one of them will tell you that if you  just imagine your success - without any practical application that you can just sort of click your heels three times and get anything you ever dreamed of.  That isn't how metaphysics works, that isn't how life works.  But what The Secret and other books in that vein do is underscore the importance that we can do what we set our minds to IF we apply ourselves and having a positive mindset, taking responsibility for one's own life and NOT blaming our circumstances on just about anything you care to name, then so-called miracles are possible.  Even Hale Dwoskin, author of the \\"Sedona Method\\" says you cannot stay in fantasy land all of the time. Even someone like Jack Canfield knows that you have to do the work, too. Visualization is only PART of the equation, but it is an important and integral part.  The Secret is just a jumping off point - that's all. There are thousands and thousands of wisdom texts out there and you only need open your eyes to see that there is a consistent message - that you can do the things you dream of. It is possible, but it begins and ends with that person.

The formatting looks like it was done for a larger screen and not the Kindle I own.

It's too hard to read and annoying, so I will definitely delete this copy.

B002LVVCIK|5.0|Capitalism: A Love Story is one of Michael Moore's best films to date; it seems that he gets better and more polished over time and that's great. Moore narrates at times to make his point; and he sometimes uses dramatic music that tells you how to feel just as he's making a point; but nevertheless it all works very well as a whole. Moore's film takes on the ugly subject not of capitalism itself but rather the type of extreme, greed-isn't-just-good-in-fact-it's-better-than-ever capitalism that is so common in very wealthy circles including top levels of major corporation management who get \\"bailouts\\" for making financial mistakes so gross that if we made the same mistakes people would consider us at best to be imprudent--and more likely to be just plain fools who would never deserve a government bailout.<br /><br />There's so much in this comprehensive film that I'm not quite sure what to tell you and what to leave out so I don't spoil it for you. However, many people have probably seen the trailer for the film which was posted on certain websites, so it's probably not ruining too much to tell you of how Michael Moore takes AIG to task with his mega-microphone; he tries to make a \\"citizen's arrest\\" of AIG top management outside their building; and his encircling the building with crime scene tape to close it off is both amusing and something many people won't exactly mind seeing. Sadly, we also see many people forced out of their homes with their lives ruined or thrown into chaos all while fat cat management, greedier than ever, makes certain that it keeps a tight control on the most amount of money so that the poor cannot ever even hope to break out of the cycle of poverty into which most of them are born.<br /><br />Moore's film also tackles other financial issues that expose the remarkable greed of certain large corporations. Companies taking out insurance polices so that they can collect on any sickly employees who die; outsourcing so many jobs that it's going to be difficult or even impossible to ever replace them all; and offshore tax schemes are just some of the few \\"strategies\\" large, large companies continue to use to make every last red cent that they can possibly make. And, of course, there were the banks that gave out mortgages like candy to people--my father, who has practiced real estate law for 69 years, started scaling back his real estate practice back in 2007 when he noticed that too many people were getting easy money mortgages from banks very far away from where they lived and bought property. To be fair, not enough people read the fine print on those mortgages; but I highly doubt that many of the banks were encouraging them to do so anyway.<br /><br />And watch how Michael Moore portrays the relationship between big business and Congress. It isn't pretty. Ouch!<br /><br />Overall, Michael Moore has given us another great film that cleverly examines the financial issues of the day and the debacle caused by corporate greed and wild, brazen extremes of capitalism. Sure, the film is biased toward Moore's own point of view, but it is rather good and I recommend you see it if only to understand where the other side is coming from.<br /><br />Good job, Michael Moore!r even impossible to ever replace them all; and offshore tax schemes are just some of the few \\"strategies\\" large, large companies continue to use to make every last red cent that they can possibly make.

His range as represented in the songs of this concert is remarkable. Alternately his is the voice of the prophet, the muse, the lecher, the lover, the poet, the madman and the priest.

These stand alongside the greats such as Suzanne, Halleluiah, So Long Marianne, The Future, and I'm Your Man.<br /><br />To help deliver this rarified material, Cohen has assembled an amazing band.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Coming of age in the early '90s, the so-called \\"grunge\\" sound became a significant portion of the soundtrack of my youth and of the tetrarchy of \\"grunge\\" band elites - Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam - AIC was easily my favorite. AIC music rocked, certainly, but it also a versatility, a genuineness, a vulnerability, an introspection that was unique to them, and together they created a wonderful catalog of memorable songs in a short span of years.     Flashing forward to the present day, the notion of a continuation of the band, after such a loss, after such a hiatus, with a new member ... one could not help but feel a certain trepidation about what a new AIC album would sound like. But after picking up the album and listening to it today, I have to say that \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" far exceeded what I had expected. The highest compliment I can pay it is to say, it in every way sounds like an Alice in Chains album. I wouldn't have thought such a thing possible. I have no idea how this album will be received by longtime fans or by critics or by the public at large, but the band should really be proud of what they've achieved here. \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" can proudly sit next to all the other great AIC releases. This is one fan who was completely satisfied.

B002BFBAUG|5.0|ADVENTURELAND is magical, a film of honesty, innocence and real life all centered around the coming of age of teen James played by the very impressive Jesse Eisenberg.  Many viewers may at first be surprised by this film and find it slow and lacking in the expected hilarity.  When the promotion work was done on this film it was a marketing travesty.  This film is directed by Greg Mottola of SUPERBAD fame, a film which redefined the comedy genre.  When one thinks of SUPERBAD it is associated with KNOCKED UP, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS and ROLE MODELS.  These films were tender tales told with over the top, in your face hilarity.  I adore these films and own them all.  They are classics.  But ADVENTURELAND was promoted as if it was in this genre and it totally is not.  The tender story of James is the center and there is heartfelt drama and emotion wrapped around this unique blend of honest characters and low scored humor.  The humor is underplayed and always there but not in an over the top way.<br /><br />James has his life all planned out, just graduated from high school and finds out that his college fund no longer exists so he must get a summer job.  The only work available is at the tacky amusement park ADVENTURELAND.  The cast is amazing and the story is told intimately in the vein of a small indie film.  James falls for Em, the ever talented Kristen Stuart.  Ryan Reynolds effectivelty underplays his role of the park gigolo.  Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader from SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE are hilarious as the owners of the park but for me most of the laughts come from the very underrated Wendie Malick who plays James mother.<br /><br />This film is a gentle coming of age story with very real characters.  It is not an over the top laughfest but instead a tender drama filled with charmed laughs.  If you find this movie to not be what you expected don't give up on it and give it a second viewing.  I guarantee it will grow on you.  It grew on me so much I had to purchase it.<br /><br />This film takes place in the mid 80s and is true to the time preriod.  There is a classic soundtrack and everything else from scenery to props are right on point.  The blu ray version has a very impressive 1080p high def transfer that show colors with immense clarity and treats darks with class.  Audio is also superb.

1416594787|5.0|There are few authors alive capable of weaving wonder and authority into popular science writing better than Richard Dawkins, and in his newest book The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution, released in September, 2009, he has shown that he is still the master of popular biology. Following a narrative that works much as the one employed by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species (and frequently mentioning Darwin), Dawkins presents a comprehensive look at the modern state of evolutionary theory, and more specifically, the evidence which proves it is true beyond any serious doubt.    I had read many Dawkins books prior to Greatest Show, including his biology and science-oriented books The Selfish Gene, The Extended Phenotype, Unweaving the Rainbow, The Blind Watchmaker, and River Out of Eden. I have not yet read The Ancestors Tale (which I understand is Dawkins most comprehensive biological work, nor have I read Climbing Mount Improbably (which Dawkins has stated is his own favorite work), both of which I own but have yet to get to. So, my review is in light of these experiences (or lack thereof).    The first couple of chapters are for softening up any hesistant readers and convincing new learners that evolution is not only realistic, it can be observed around us in a myriad of ways, including the comparisons between natural selection and the artificial selection practiced by human animal and plant breeders.     Following this intro, Dawkins lays down the tool kit and shows how Neo-Darwinian theory knows how to trust estimated dates, looking at the various chemical clocks available.     The chapter titled \\"Before Our Very Eyes\\" was the most enjoyable and enlightening for me, personally, as the reader has described for him/her several fascinating experiments which have demonstrated the power of natural selection and mutation to drive complex genetic progression. The information on the Richard Lenski-led study of E. coli is worth the price of the bookalone. Tremendously important and strong evidence for Dawkins' central thesis.    Dawkins follows this by moving into fossil records, showing the reader how scientists have studied and come to see the fossil record as important, but not the most important facts available to evolutionary theory. He shows that the 'gaps' in the fossil record are actually useful for taxonomic reasons, and posits that a complete fossil record would lead to immense confusion when trying to determine just where a new species begins from the old. Dawkins also knocks down the argument that talk of 'missing links' is useful, and pleads for the cessation of this term since its usefulness has long-since been destroyed. Like he says often, every fossil we find is a missing link, every one is a transitional fossil of some sort.    The chapter \\"You did it yourself in nine months\\" was my least favorite, though it was certainly necessary to present in a comprehensive view of evolution. The following chapter on biogeography returns to a superior narrative and offers strong evidence for geographic proof of evolution, again, just as Darwin did in describing the variety of species found strew across the Galapagos Islands. Following that are chapters on cousinship among life forms and the ability of DNA to provide a historical archive which begin to draw together a personal closeness that derives from the evidence of the preceding chapters.    The final couple of chapters move a bit more toward being meditative, though don't expect Dawkins to get too mushy. What begins as a discussion of arms races ends with a look at 'evolutionary theodicy', where Dawkins argues that we find suffering and pain exactly as we would expect from the emotionless processes of natural selection.     Finally, the book winds down with more reflection as Dawkins expounds upon the last paragraph of Darwin's Origin and draws together the book's conclusion by reinforcing that the fact of evolution does not depend on any statement about abiogenesis or origin of life concerns. Clearly, what the theory suggest, and has been proven by practically every bit of evidence uncovered, is that, however it started, evolution is the way in which living things grow, compete, reproduce, and change.     I haven't read a more comprehensive book on Evolution to date, and I think Dawkins has abolutely knocked it out of the park here. I admit to a strong Dawkins bias, so I wanted to like this book, but I also had very high hopes for it because it was the first Dawkins biology-centric book to be released since I started reading his work. I expected a ton. I got it and more.     For the beginning reader, I would still recommend the much-more streamlined arguments in Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True, but for the reader with some science experience, or for the curious reader who wants the full picture, this is as good as it gets. Five stars.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|The songs are completely different from previous albums, but hauntingly great to listen to and enjoy.
1423101472|5.0|After five books (delivered over an especially timely five years; people who thought J.K Rowling let her books get too big as they went on (I am not one of those) will doubtless of the five's relatively uniform lengths), the adventures of Percy Jackson and his band of friends at last come to an end.  The stage is set for the final conflict between the Olympian Gods and the revived armies of the Titanomachy, led by the evil Kronos, Lord of Time.  Spoilers follow, as the details of the book are discussed at some length.    The preceding entry, \\"Battle of the Labyrinth\\", saw Kronos take a physical form, that of his disciple Luke, a bitter child of the Olympian God Hermes.  Not yet at his full power, Kronos nevertheless plans his revenge against his usurping children and their heirs, and many of the minor deities and dispossessed half-bloods flock to his banner.  I will say that Riordan is at points not really successful at achieving the ambiguity that he seems to be going for in depicting the Olympian-Titan generational conflict.  He is adept at highlighting the shortcomings of the Olympians, as per the revelations regarding Hades' children Nico and Bianca, or through the lengthy spiel of the Titan Prometheus, who sides with Kronos.  Nevertheless, Kronos and his primary minions never come across as anything less than pure evil, leaving it very hard to see why anyone remotely rational would choose him over Zeus's occasionally severe dickishness.    That aside, this book marks a tremendous finale for the series.  Most of the story is an all-out war between the Olympians' heroes and the armies of Kronos (while the gods themselves battle Typhon).  All of the campers we've come to know over the preceding books are thrust into the thick of it, and large numbers get their own moments to shine.  Since this is the epic finale, more than one meets their end in heroic fashion as well.  The ambiguity of the half-bloods' position is illustrated reasonably well through characters like Luke and Ethan Nakamura.  And the conclusion suggests the beginning of a better era for Olympus, including, in a very nice moment, Percy remembering poor Calypso from the last book (on the one hand, it might have been more literary to preserve the sad ending, but, on the other, of course Percy would remember her).    The spotlight rotating through the various Olympians continues here.  Recurring players such as Hermes and Hades get more time in the sun, and Demeter puts in a brief appearance (of all the Fourteen, she gets shortchanged here, though).  The real surprise, though is Hestia, the Goddess of the Hearth, little more than a footnote in the myths, but elevated to real symbolic importance here (she is the titular last Olympian).    Our heroes arrive at their various ends.  The temporary obstacle to the Percy/Annabeth pairing, Rachel, is assigned a new role that takes her out of contention (as an aside, I liked that she and Annabeth never really put aside their hostility and became friends before this happened, in a bit of realism).  Said relationship is nicely handled, and the issue of Luke is resolved in a very mature manner as well.    I will be interested to see if Riordan can next do for the Gods of Egypt what he has done for the Gods of Greece.
0385504225|5.0|Lost Symbol deals with a family tragedy, brotherhood and the subject of man's enlightenment.  It's a story that takes place in approximately a 12-hour timeline.  And although I figured out the true identity of one of the main characters earlier than I had expected, the thrill never ceased.     The facts about DC and the early masons are intriguing enough to want to do some research on your own.  I've been to DC twice, visited the Smithsonian Museums and even stayed across the street from the WH, but after reading LS, I realized I've missed so much.  This should definitely help bring tourism to the DC area.      To all those considering purchasing this book, you will truly enjoy the read, learn how to decipher codes and want to learn more about DC and this country's \\"founding fathers\\" and their role in the freemasons.      BTW, try deciphering the codes on the book's cover.  What FUN that was!

B002C1BHIO|2.0|This item gets 2 stars for Amazon's full backing - easy returns, warranty - but can't earn the rest because it offers very little additional value, even when compared to other AmazonBasics products - in other words, I am not aware of any advantages of braided cables or extra-shielded cables in a home settings at lengths of 6 feet. I also have an issue with the 'Ultra High Speed' designation. While the HDMI consortium does define 'High Speed' and 'Category 2', the 'Ultra' addition seems to be the product of over-zealous marketing from some vendors too eager to differentiate their product and to justify higher prices.<br /><br />Just to clear any doubt, this cable works as well as any other 6 ft. HDMI wire, including the premium ones and it's no better than those that sell at Amazon for one penny (I actually have one in use right now). The one advantage of this semi-premium-priced wire over the 'regular' ones is some extra shielding which, in the event of an airburst (EMP) above one's residence would ensure that the TV continues to get a clear picture.<br /><br />AmazonBasics vs. Other Discount Brands<br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />It's not an easy call between an AmazonBasics-branded wire and someone else's that sells for less (plus shipping :) ) but, here's why I went with Amazon this time.<br /><br />If you look carefully, you will find the probably hundreds of HDMI 'brands' offered at Amazon (exclude the 'premium') fall in about 3 'types' as far as pricing:<br /><br />a - in the single-digits plus shipping<br />b - in the mid to high single digits that qualify for Super Savers free shipping<br />c - listed for as low as pennies plus shipping<br /><br />This product may compete with 'a' on price but not with categories 'b' and 'c'. Category 'c' saves you a few dollars - and I did order a couple of these myself as well as one of the less expensive Amazon cables: [[ASIN:B001T9NUJE AmazonBasics  High Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet / 2.0 Meters) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]]].<br /><br />Amazon has a few extra advantages worth considering if you don't mind paying a little extra.<br /><br />- EASY RETURN - I know because I had to return quite a few items for various reasons. Amazon makes it very easy and, if you are returning the item because it came defective or damaged Amazon pays for shipping.<br /><br />- WARRANTY - these wires come with a 1-year warranty (talking about future-proofing). If an HDMI cable performs for one year, the ods that it would stop working after that are pretty close to zero. It's possible that the other vendors back their inexpensive cables too (I never checked) but I am highly confident that Amazon will be around to honor its warranty and I'm not so sure about vendors I know less.<br /><br />- QUALITY ASSURANCE - I've never had any problems with 'cheap' HDMI cables but it may be reassuring to have Amazon's name on a wire. My assumption is that Amazon did insist on some quality checks before they stamped their logo on the product.<br /><br />HDMI Background and the FUD of Premium Cables<br />---------------------------------------------<br /><br />Let's face it, HDMI 1.3x cables have become a commodity these days. There are 'premium' brands, for sure and some look prettier than others (for something that goes to the back of your equipment and no one else will probably see) but the fact is that nearly all of today's makes and models qualify for 'high-speed' or 'Category 2' (see HDMI 1.3 specs below). Just to eliminate the confusion, it's worth stating that:<br /><br />- Practically all HDMI 1.3x certified cables are HIGH-SPEED or CATEGORY 2. Only the Category 2 (high-speed) cables support 1080p resolutions.<br /><br />- The HDMI official site advises that even HDMI cables under 15 ft. (5m) that were made BEFORE the HDMI 1.3 specification can work as Category 2 cables.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|I just love the idea of shopping on the internet and amazon makes it safe,easy and fast. If ever I have any questions they know how to communicate with me and answer any questions to the best of their knowledge,thanks Amazon.
B0021L8UXU|5.0|I'm a pretty big RomZomCom fan. Loved [[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead]]. Thought [[ASIN:B000V4UH08 Fido]] was brilliant (kind of mix of Zombies meet [[ASIN:6305308659 Pleasantville]] or Lassie). So I was pretty hyped to get a look at ZOMBIELAND.<br /><br />The premise is really nothing new: Zombies show up. Take over the world. A group of survivors has to make their way through the maze-like brain-eaters on their way to ...somewhere. But this time we get some seriously dysfunctional people who are forced to ban together and become a gun-blazing family. The patriarch of this unusual gathering is none other than Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson, [[ASIN:B0011BE3K0 No Country for Old Men]]) who supposedly lost a puppy that's caused him to go a bit loco into Zombie slaughtering. He'll pound `em to death with a banjo (while strumming a little ditty from [[ASIN:6305558159 Deliverance]] ...and you might even catch him saying a few lines from that unique film), cut their heads off with pruning sheers, or just fill them full of lead. The son of this disturbed family is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg, [[ASIN:B000CS464G The Squid and the Whale]]), an introvert shut-in who has difficulty forming human connections because of his excessive nerdiness (think Mountain Dew drinking, World of Warcraft playing loner and you'll be right on the mark ...literally). Columbus has survived by alienating himself from everyone and everything ...and by creating a laundry list of rules that have helped him stay Zombie-free (Rule #1 - Cardio. Rule #3 - Beware of bathrooms ...which have contributed to Columbus' irritable bowel problems. The list goes all the way up into the 30s and you can occasionally see the rules placed at varying intervals throughout the movie whenever their usefulness is used within its framework). Columbus and Tallahassee team up as they head across the USA - from East to West - and eventually encounter two scam artist sisters: the lovely Wichita (Emma Stone, [[ASIN:B000WZEZHC Superbad]]) and her younger sibling Little Rock (Abigail Breslin, [[ASIN:B001JNNDDI Little Miss Sunshine]]). The two girls steal the mens guns and transportation only to later meet up and join with them on this cross country trek.<br /><br />The great thing about Zombieland is that it really isn't dramatic at all. It is purely comedic, even when you feel they might be heading toward the dramatic. For instance, once Columbus discovers why Tallahassee if really messed up (not because of a dog), the audience is lead to believe there will be this sweet, touching moment. But don't be foolish! Tallahassee comes up with another one-line zinger that keeps the film's comedic timing right on track.<br /><br />The romantic portions of the film are confined to Columbus' desires to brush Wichita's hair back over her ear ...and one little kiss. So, again, the comedy just kept coming.<br /><br />It was also great that the film never went overboard in terms of time. At only 87 minutes in total, the movie moves along at a pace and doesn't wander in the slightest.<br /><br />Comparisons between this flick and SHAUN OF THE DEAD are already being made (no surprise). They both have their strengths. Shaun of the Dead ruled because it wasn't one-liners that kept it going, but a continuous montage of comedic events that spilled one on-top of another, and just kept snowballing. But Zombieland has the zingers. The one-liners are excellently placed within the story. My favorite one was \\"Thank God for rednecks!\\"<br /><br />And you can't not mention Bill Murray, the surprise pseudo-Zombie guest star. His short but extremely funny part was vital to the story (and remember to stay in the theater until after the credits finish rolling for a special treat).<br /><br />So some might want to weigh which was the better RomZomCom: Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland. But there's no need. They're both in firmly in the genre, and are excellent portrayals in their own comedic right. Enjoy them both. I know I did.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This really the best rock album of 2009. Jerry and the other members of Alice in Chains made a really good job. I was really a good fan of Layne, but I have to admit that the final results of the songs are not so far from the old ones. A pretty good mix of \\"Dirt\\", \\"Jar of flies\\", \\"Grind\\" and the new evolution. I can only suggest it. You will not be disappointed!!
B002JM1VJG|5.0|I just finished watching the dvd. After reading so many negatives comments about the collecction, I just gotta say that it was the best Madonna video collection so far. Yes you guys being haters are having issues cause you are using Blu-ray players. I still have my regular dvd player and pic looks fine to me! maybe I'm not much into technology...the only low point in the collection was the censored version of \\"Justify My Love\\"; but I can live with that! Awesome collection!
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|i zipped through this one! but the author definitely was trying to convince the reader of some philosophical perspective; i don't know what becausei skipped through the last 50 pages or so once the plot had been resolved.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|After the spectacular Met-Pavarotti disk, this presentation at first seemed drab. But then a realization. This is a great and moving presentation with, in this disk, a truly great drama, not a showcase for vocal gymnastics.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Sooo good to have the old standards of Whitney Houston on one album. Anyone liking Whitney will love this album.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The costumes, the settings, the acting, are all first rate.  The historical information and insights are a story in themselves and I highly recommend the viewer activate that option with each disk.  It is a shame we load the minds of children with the garbage, which passes for entertainment today, when we could fire their minds with documentaries like, \\"John Adams\\".
B001AQTWF2|5.0|After so long out of the spotlight, so good to hear the loving, gentle Whitney again.
B000WO251Q|5.0|This book is wonderful! It will absolutely make you cry but you will love it. It would make a perfect gift for a Nicholas Sparks lover or anyone!
1401216676|5.0|This comic is one of the shortest stories that I have ever read, but one of the greatest. Any fan of the Joker needs to own this 46 page piece of art. It's wonderful.
0385504225|2.0|I was one of the people that bought the book the first day it came out, having read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\" and enjoyed both books.  I got the book to keep me occupied and interested for some long plane rides while en route to vacation.    The book started off alright, but eventually I found the pattern of events predictable and almost as if Brown used the same format (or outline) as he did for the previous 2 books in terms of plot progression, characters etc.  I found the dialogue so fake and unrealistic.  I found the CIA deputy director character annoyingly cliche and ridiculous (the smoking, the harsh orders, the way she spoke, how she acted etc.).  The villain was also cliche and lacked real depth in terms of motivation the reader could understand.  His motivation was dubious, ranking somewhere along the lines as just mentally unstable which is easily dismissed as a reader.      The end was anticlimactic, I found myself not even caring how it ended and skimmed through to the end to see if anything good was actually going to happen, any interesting insights or revelations.  Sad to say, there wasn't.  It was all either cliche, preachy, or some apparent imitation of the other previous 2 well-known books.          I was disappointed to say the least.  Dan Brown is a smart, knowledgeable author and much of that knowledge came through in the book as various plot details unfolded.  But the basic premise for the villain and then ending was just not that thrilling or interesting as the book progressed.
B002JM1VJG|2.0|All of the people saying that the fans are overreacting either work for Warner Brothers, are not detail-oriented people, or are very, VERY easily pleased. And to everyone saying \\"they are old videos from the 80's, of course they won't look perfect\\", that is NOT an excuse. If they can make The Wizard OF Oz and Gone With The Wind look the way they do, they can make a few videos from only 25 years ago look AMAZING. There are NO excuses, NO if's, NO and's, NO butt's. THERE IS NO WAY TO JUSTIFY THE SLOPPY editing work on this release. \\"I Want You\\" is particularly devastating as this beautiful video looks like it was taken straight from youtube. \\"Burning Up\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\" are also particularly grainy, with \\"Lucky Star\\" looking completely washed out and worse than it appeared on the Immaculate Collection DVD. I will be fair, some of the videos look ok, I've only skimmed through the DVD so far, but I remember \\"Material Girl\\", and most of the newer videos looking decent. The sound on \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" is flawed, there are several instances of static throughout the video. And now we get to \\"Justify My Love\\". It is censored. Not to mention, Warner Bros. stated in their OFFICIAL PRESS RELEASE (Official! Not speculation, not a rumor, not a \\"maybe\\", an OFFICIAL STATEMENT on Madonna's OFFICIAL WEB SITE) that \\"Justify  My Love\\" would contain unedited and previously unreleased footage. That footage is no where to be seen. It wouldn't make me mad if they hadn't promised it in the first place. And the fact that they ended up CENSORING it makes it even more of a slap in the face in addition to a BOLD FACED LIE. Why would Madonna allow this? The 1990 VHS single sold thousands of copies in its original version, and this comes from a woman who went on Nightline on ABC back in 1990 and DEFENDED this video to the nation. I miss that Madonna.    I'm tempted to give the DVD 3 stars but I just can't. The only way I can give it 2 is because I have loved Madonna since I was a kid and her videos are amazing. How could one of the biggest music video visionaries, not to mention the most famous female pop star in the world, not have a justifiable and complete video archive of her work, especially now that she is ending her long run with Warner?? it boggles my mind and it makes me more mad the more I think about it, especially since this is probably the last Madonna collection we are going to get anytime soon. Unfortunately, WB probably won't do Madonna any justice with her work until she's dead.     Are the videos unwatchable? No. (except maybe for \\"I Want You\\"). They are just barely OK. just BARELY. If you are a Madonna fan, you have to have it. Do i sound bitter? HELL YES. And we have a right to be. We have been fans for YEARS and this whole project was not handled professionally. Don't even get me started on the errors on the CD version.
0375413405|5.0|I've got racks of cooking technique books and after seeing the Julie, Julia movie I realized that I'd never bothered to buy this book. After reading a bit of it I understand why it is regarded as such a classic.
0756405890|5.0|I don't generally read fantasy novels but something about the premise of this book attracted me. Almost immediately it drew me in using nothing more than good writing, an intriguing plot, and rich characters. As the plot develops the we learn more about Kvothe, around whom this autobiographical fantasy novel revolves, and it turns into a wonderful and absorbing story. The book really has everything you could want as a reader, with action, romance, heroism, and adventure. There is also a brooding sadness about the book, which begins in the prologue itself and ticks along in the background. I would highly recommend this novel to both new and experienced fantasy novel readers, as well as anybody who enjoys an expertly written but unpretentious story.
0756405890|5.0|This is a brilliant book, the best I've read in years.<br /><br />My one quibble is that, IMO, the entire dragon sequence could have been excised--I don't see any need for it in the plot, and Kvothe meeting there with Denna was just too coincidental. But everything else was great, from the characterization, to the setting (especially the University), to the easy, fluid style.<br /><br />One thing I love is how the \\"present\\" moment in the book and the growing tension with these unknown threats from outside is in juxtaposition with Kvothe's past, and the story he tells. There's so much plot tension arising simply from the reader wondering how young, brilliant, insecure Kvothe became the weary innkeeper. Basically this entire book is back story to the \\"present\\" action, but it's so wonderfully told that I'd have listened to a story twice the length. I suspect book two will be the same, the backstory of how Kvothe learns to fight, and the third will finally take up the plot of the innkeeper and the return of the demons.<br /><br />I look forward to the sequel very, very much. I'd join in the complaining that it's already been a long wait since book one, but you can't rush genius. Take your time, Patrick Rothfuss. I'll buy it in hardcover whenever you're ready.

0061478784|5.0|I never even knew this book existed before Hayao Miyazaki made his film based on it. That movie is truly one of my favorites.....that being said, after I saw the movie and found out it was based on a book by DWJ, I had to read it. I absolutely loved the book.....and after thinking it over, I realized I loved the book more than the film. You get insight into the characters so much more, and Howl's character is so much more lovable and humorous in the book. I also love the different dimensions that were not included into the movie. The thing is, you have to realize that the book and movie are two completely different things; wonderful on their own levels. DWJ's writing is amazingly smooth and witty, for adults and children. I would recommend this book and the sequels very very highly!! I know I will being reading this book and the others to my children one day.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|I was expecting  a book to keep me on the dge of my seat but instead had trouble keeping my eyes open. There is some action in the last third of the book but I really got turned off by the religious hokum at the end.
0143038583|4.0|According to Michael Pollan, the omnivore's dilemma is that if you can eat everything you're not entirely sure what to eat.  If that sounds lame and obvious that's because it is, and there are long sections of the book where the author engages in self-indulgent and pointless philosophizing.  Nevertheless, the book is informative enough in certain sections and entertaining enough in others to make it a worthwhile read.      For his structure Michael Pollan creates two dichotomies.  The first is between corn, the plant that underlies the omnipresent industrial food system, and grass, the plant that harks back to a more innocent and healthier age of man.  The second is between two meals:  a quick cheap McDonald's meal that Michael Pollan's family eats in their car, and another meal that the author has to spend many months hunting and foraging, entertaining adventures that the author spends many chapters recounting.  According to Michael Pollan, both meals are not really possible but while we know that the latter is clearly unsustainable we fail to see that in the former.     Michael Pollan is annoying and pretentious as an intellectual but as a journalist he does manage to find interesting people doing interesting things.  By far the most interesting section of the book is on Joel Salatin, a self-described \\"Christian-conservative-libertarian-environmentalist-lunatic farmer\\" who has ingeniously created his own self-sufficient eco-system called Polyface Farm.  Just as it's not really possible to replicate the author's hunting and foraging of a meal, it's also not really possible for farmers to replicate Joel Salatin's eccentric genius in creating a small profitable farm in defiance of the industrial food system.      So what exactly is Michael Pollan's point?  As we can observe from his final section where he waxes poetic about the beauty of hunting wild boar and foraging for wild mushrooms the author doesn't have any point because he's too entrenched in comfort in Berkeley, California to really care about the dangerous and serious ramifications of the industrial food system.

B000WC39ZE|5.0|I loved this movie as a child myself & still do so I thought I'd give it a shot with my 3 year old..( that acts like she's 6 ) LOL...Anyway this is a great story & adventure for the whole family...Highly recomended...  :0)
006136472X|5.0|Ken Follett is a remarkably good storyteller.  What sets his books apart is the plot layering with its multiple sources of tension, all converging to a crescendo in the last pages.  The characters are fairly credible and the scenes are portrayed well.  But where Follett is in a class of his own is in the craft of the thriller.  Every page is dedicated to creating or maintaining excitement.  The author clearly did his homework on the technical aspects of the tracking of radioactive materials, and he put a great deal of time into learning every nook and cranny of freighters, in order to depict the action concluding the book.<br /><br />Here we have Russian agents, Egyptian double agents, Palestinian agents, and a dashing Israeli agent, sometimes working together and at other times slitting one another's throats.  And is the Oxford don's beautiful daughter really in love with the Israeli agent, or is she the most duplicitous one of the lot?  These may be the fastest four hundred pages of your life, as you race alongside the protagonists, now morphing into antagonists, then back again.<br /><br />This book is a lesson plan in plot layering and recommended for fans of complexity and for those who would like to learn the craft from a master.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Watching Mad Men is a visit to the past.  Sopranos writers and producers have recreated a believable 1960s industry.  The costumes, scripts and acting are first rate.  There is no need for a willing suspension of disbelief; every bit is absolutely real.
0375805613|5.0|I saw this book in the free book bin yesterday at the library and it brought back some great memories. It was the first book I learned to read (as I remember). My wife had never heard of it, and I was tempted to pick it up for myself (I read through it of course). I was glad to see a guy with a little kid behind us pick it up. Lucky kid!
0385504225|3.0|If you like conspiracy books, then this book will surely spark your interest.  Unlike Dan Brown's other successfull novels, this one doesn't have enough character development.  I do enjoy the fact that \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is well researched and well thought out.  For whatever reason, Dan Brown likes to reiterate certain points over and over and over.  This book could have been a much more interesting read if he cut it down to about 350 pages.
0385504225|3.0|I thought the book was fair. I think it took a while to get into the book. The first third of the book seemed slow and repetitive. There were too many unnecessary details. But if you like architectural history you would like it. The plots flow is much like the Da Vinci Code. The overall plot was predictable but the suspense well kept. The book picked up pace and once the action began it was more interesting and enjoyable. There were many new ideas that I enjoyed and liked the more spiritual openness of the book. Only a few charecters were well developed. I do commend Dan Brown for his great imagination. I just hope he diversifies into more different plot themes.<br /><br />Preetham Grandhi<br />Author of A Circle of Souls<br />[[ASIN:1599552353 A Circle of Souls]]

When I am pressed for time I do level 3 and I get everybit of a workout in 20 min, this level 3 is tough and delivers results. I want more of Jillian Micheals, loving her videos.

0385504225|3.0|One would think that with all Robert Langdon experienced in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angles and Demons\\", he'd be a bit more open-minded and willing to believe anything is possible.  Not so.  His stock comment in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" seems to be \\"It's a myth\\".  After the fourth or fifth time, that phrase begins to grate on the nerves.  And why are we constantly being told that Katherine \\"tucks her hair behind her ear\\"?  Grate, grate, grate.  Interesting theory, interesting facts, interesting premise, but pales by comparison to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Then again, should we compare it?  Perhaps not; perhaps it should stand or fall on its own merit.  Too bad Langdon's new-found attitude drags \\"Symbol\\" down.  Still a worthwhile read, but not a five-star edge-of-the-seater.
0385504225|5.0|It seems to be a universal law that if a writer has a huge success, his succeeding book will be universally slighted, sneered at and depreciated.  Actually, in many ways Lost Symbol improves on Da Vinci Code (which revolutionized my attitudes about Christ and Christianity in its present phallocentric, political incarnation).  Lost Symbol is set in Washington, DC, a city I've always seen as an oppressive network of crushing bureaucracies -- i.e., boring.  But Brown digs under this view to find a Washington that is both extremely interesting and exceedingly strange:  Washington is actually a wheel with turning spokes of influence taking us into the future or a vortex of spheres of power whirling in some kind of strange and dynamic synchronicity.  The book deals with a Washington in which the CIA tries to save democracy (isn't this the FBI's job?), where basements and subbasements extend into levels beneath levels, a symbology of historic complexity rendered concrete with a lot of taxpayer money.  The action goes from the Capitol -- seen in almost surreal terms which make what for most of us is a familiar cliche new and strange -- to the Library of Congress to the Smithsonian Institution to the National Cathedral, and other locales, all institutions which have been developed on a scale never yet seen in terms of architecture and collections of books, art and scientific specimens, technology, etc., that bogle the mind in terms of extent, inclusiveness, etc. The main motif, that the early Federalists of note (Jefferson, Washington, Benjamin Franklin, L'Enfant, etal.) were Freemasons, an association not incidental to  putting together a unique form of government on the basis of a humanistic philosophy, is beautifully developed and unless you are the kind of reader who merely wants to gallop from acts of violence to gratuitous sex acts, Brown's development of the importance of the Freemasons, their philosophy and imprint on democracy is intensely interesting and certainlysomething that every history class I ever took never thought to mention, much less develop as possibly significant in the development of a deistic republic based on a meritocracy (along with the anomalies -- slaves built the Capitol and the early government buildings) is left to Brown to expand on and to bring into the present in the person of his female scientist who is on the cutting edge of noetic research, the next evolution of science away from the mechanistic and the materialistic and even the Einsteinian view that space and time are actual facts rather than descriptions or thought-energy we use to navigate reality.  This book is also extremely witty (i.e., note the many ways Langdon's claustrophobia comes up!) and the characters are not undeveloped, they are simply developed as aspects of their driving motivations and ideas.  Brown adheres to his Da Vinci formula but also turns it on its head with his latest superman villain/everyman megalomaniac.  Robert Langdon is a witty take on the usual hero of this genre.  Academically gifted and omniverously curious, he is also a determined naive rationalist, even while he solves a puzzle under threat of imminent death! This is a genre novel with a difference. Brown has used the genre to reach a huge audience with ideas that need to be diffused NOW. I suppose some people will be tempted to skip the last few chapters after the denouement and the epilogue.  I suggest these are the core of the book and maybe should be re-read.
B00004YA66|5.0|Having advanced degrees in neither Physics nor Metaphysics, I accept entirely the possibility that all the events transcribed in this satisfying opus could have happened and may well happen in the future. With the exception of the quite prosaic mode of communication between generations, all the action is a matter of everyday occurrences carried out in everyday style. The success of Director and Cast in maintaining that spirit of ordinariness is one of the two chief elements in carrying the day for the film. The second, even more important, is the prayerful wish fulfillment provided by the fundamentally  ritualistic character of the film, that death does not sever the connection of generations and that nobody truly dies. Whatever the secular character of our minds there is always lurking at those deepest level of the human psyche the need to believe that neither we nor our loved ones die. It is at that level, through the fine work of the cast and the creators, that people felt much of their pleasure in the film.<br />Maybe not! At any rate, it is a film redolent of all those in movie history which have sought to convey the message that time and death can be defeated; it does a good job for what it seeks to be....something not quite as dramatically penetrating as Hamlet.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|What is the point of this film? I am not sure anyone knows. I am not sure if I care after watching this boring dread of a movie for almost two hours. I deserve a full refund just for not sleeping through this movie. And boy staying awake through this film was really hard.<br /><br />So the world loses its fertility. The film never explains why or how. It doesn't care. It doesn't really care to explain why an immigrant woman is having the world's first baby in 18 years. Why 18 years? Why is this movie so anti anti-immigration? Why in the world would Britain force its immigrants out when the human population is dwindling? The film never cares to explain. By midway of the film, I really didn't care about this film.<br /><br />The only saving grace of this film is its brilliant continuous action sequences. They were shot beautifully and the filmmakers certainly put an enormous amount of effort into them. Too bad the continuous action sequences were wrapped around a plot worthy of replacing Gigli as the worst of this decade.<br /><br />In the end, we clearly see the movie never had a point. I totally regret I fought drowsiness throughout this movie when I should have fell asleep during the first minute.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|I am a fan of Archer and this one did not disappoint.  I enjoyed the subject which was a bit of a change of pace for me. I recommend this book to Archer fans who are also interested in both history and personal achievement stories.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|We rented this first from Netflix and knew i had to own a copy - got a good price on Amazon, and have shared it with many.....given it to them to watch, not copied it!  Great story about a woman who knew what she wanted and worked to make it happen, and found love on the way.

031236198X|3.0|\\"Our Iceberg Is Melting\\" is a fable which deals with the subjects of change management, human behavior, and team building in similar form as \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\". Some interesting insights may be drawn concerning human behavior - specifically how people react to change, differing personalities, and the challenges that one may encounter when working in a small team environment. There are at least a couple disturbing techniques (at least in my opinion) that encourage crowd behavior and lessen independent thinking. Not my cup of tea but may be a good fit for someone seeking guidance in a corporate environment.

B001MS7IBS|5.0|I love JJ Abrams. Everything that he has written is a masterpiece, and Fringe is no exception. This series does start out a little slow. JJ wanted to keep the show simple so new viewers could jump in, about halfway through the season that went out the window and the show really shined. The show really took it's time to get alot of pieces into place the first part of the season then in the second part of the season it used all those pieces to blow us away. If you enjoyed any of JJ's other programs, or if your a fan of great television dramas you will love Fringe I guarantee it. The actors and storyline are superb. The casting is excellent there is not a wasted character in this show, because the actors bring depth to even the small impact roles. The storyline and characters make this show a must have for any serious TV fan. No dvd or blu ray library is complete without it.     The Blu Ray release is amazing. Well worth the extra money, with an amazing high def transfer that blows you away with every frame. Also there are special features that are only available on the Blu Ray edition. This set is a treat for a fan of the show and also will be cherished by a newcomer to the series. Pick this show up today you will not be disappointed. I give it my highest recomendation.
B0002XMF5I|5.0|this wound up being just a one album deal with  ian gillan taking the mike after dio left. this is often overlooked release in the sabbath cannon, but it rocks. sounding sometimes like sabbath and sometimes like deep purple this remaster sounds a lot better than the original.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|This is way too cool!    It's super easy to set up. Software was a breeze to install.  A piece of cake to record my old vinyls to my PC and burn onto a CD. It literally walks you right through the steps. Playback of the disc was fantastic.     First I recorded one of my favorite old albums and the sound was far superior than the store bought music CD's. We couldn't believe how great the sound is! So next I grabbed one of my most scratched vinyls just to put it to the test and see what it can do. I couldn't believe how well it cleaned up the clicks and pops(we can hardly hear them between tracks on this one.)     I'm finally recording all of my old albums and can quit wasting money on CD's to replace them. I highly rate this unit. Now I'm on the search for used albums. Far better sound quality from the old vinyls than the new CD's.     (I don't see what the problem is for some of you. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews)
0803729227|4.0|Cute story, but not quite as good as Room on the Broom.  Still fun to read with the kids (ages 2 and 4).
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book did not disappoint. I found myself holding my breath in anticipation of the next paragraph. I'm glad I bought it immediahtely.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|I received this 2-meter AmazonBasics HDMI cable for review, from Vine, and I am confident in saying that i am immediately very impressed with it, after only a couple of hours of use.  I used the cable to replace the HDMI that connects my DirecTV HD-box to my Mitsubishi projector in my screening room, and there was no decline in quality of my live-tv feed.  Compared to the cable that i replaced, i'd also like to hilight two (2) impressive features of the AmazonBasics cable: 1) the cable braiding is VERY thick, making this a very durable cable (it's a far thicker sheath than the one on my old HDMI cable) and 2) the 2 male ends are also appear to very solid - they look like molded casings that hold/surround the connectors at each end (my old cable had a 2-piece bracket over the connectors, and one of them actually fell apart while i was swapping out the old cable for testing, so the sturdiness of the Amazon cable definitely got my attention).  Combine all these features with a VERY reasonable price (under $20 for a 2-meter cable) and i have to say that not only is this cable a very good deal, but i'd be interested in seeing what other 'Basics\\" products that Amazon can come up with (A/V or otherwise) - no frills packaging, but a quality product, at a terrific price.
0385504225|3.0|I did not have the opportunity to read \\"Da Vinci Code\\", but had watched the movie. I found the movie bland and filled with Hollywood style fluff. None of the information and \\"secrets\\"  in the plot was new to me either - that happens when you watch the History Channel enough times ! Thus I decided to read The Lost Symbol as I wanted the perspective from a complete and actual book and not a screenplay. Boy was I disappointed. Firstly - it's hard to read a book and already know which actor will play the role - and thus I had to have a few  hours of Tom Hanks stuck in my head. I felt that the writer was writing the story with the big screen in mind. I could picture this little Japanese woman played by Lucy Liu. I saw Peter Facinelli (spelling?) as his good friend Peter that was kidnapped.     The requisite, intelligent leading lady role was a mild irritation. Her jumps to sudden insight ahead of the lead, Langdon, simply did not make sense where he is supposed to be the super smart historian, symbolist et al.  Each chapter gives the reader a moment where suddenly, an awe inspiring discovery or revelation is made - and you have to read through a couple of pages to find out what that is. And when it is revealed, you are let down as you expected something more earth shattering and mind blowing.    I am not too worried on whether his book is accurate in terms of technology, symbology or history - I am fully aware that it is a work of fiction - however I still felt that some of the things mentioned was unnecessary and I wasn't sure what purpose it served. I was also boggled that the old story on how man once believed the world to be flat - was mentioned over and over as if the reader needed reminding that we shouldn't discount anything as impossible ! I felt that was an insult to our collective intelligence. The ending that was supposed to be the major-what-the-world-has-been-waiting-for \\"secret\\" - was again....a major let down. The fact that the secret verbum significatiumwas \\"The Word\\"  - which was from the Bible - as in \\"And the word was..God\\". I man really now !! Maybe I'm expecting too much from Dan Brown's readers, fans and new initiates into his work. Maybe I'm  expecting them to be familiar with the ideas that perhaps God does lie within all of us, or we are Gods, or God created us in His image (our minds at least), or that there is only one God, or that We Are All One - hasn't various works of fiction, non-fiction and movies taught many that much. So to have it suddenly be this big secret and then use another old cliche that the Bible contains all we need to know - we just have to look for it - or that there are hidden messages in there etc etc.    The only plausible reason for all that I can come up with - is that Dan Brown is prepping everyone for his next book - something along the lines of the Bible being loaned to him by Peter to be decoded. And we will then have a whole new book that steals much of the body of The Bible Code.    Nevertheless - despite all of the above - what I actually liked about the book  - was that Dan Brown creates a page turner. He has the ability to tease the enquiring minds that still read books - by ending each chapter with a cliff hanger. Regardless of whether he is a skillful writer or not - the fact that I could not put the book down until I had read it completely - bears testament to the fact that he definitely has a latent talent for turning moderately intelligent people into little kids eager to be let in on the secret. Also I enjoyed the tidbits of Masonry. Everything I've ever read or watched paints Masonry in a dark light - this was the first time I have seen it portrayed in a benevolent way - makes me think Dan Brown is a closet Mason - or Rosicrucian at least (not - I have no desire to google whether he is or isn't , just my opinion). I also enjoyed the busting of a few myths I didn't know. As learned and cultured  as I'm sure many readers are - I for one am slightly learned but definitely not cultured, and did not know a few things he mentions in his book such as the work with Noetic Sciences, The Intention Experiment, the whole Mayan 2012 world ending doodads, the existence of the paintings and sculptures he describes.     So - as with any book - I am reviewing it based on whether it was worth my time reading it, and if I gained anything by reading it - whether it's good entertainment value or whether I took anything new away from reading it. It was a moderate in entertainment value - however I am a very curious person so I love myth busting, revelations and learning new information - and that's where I rate it highly.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|this cd sounds like a throwback to the 70's with a modern twist.great cd from a new band.just wonder what the 2nd cd will sound like with 2/3 of the band being replaced.
B000051Y0G|5.0|Cyndi's first album captures the 1983/84 era perfectly.  It combines pop, rock, synth and new wave styles.  Her voice is great.  She always manages to convey happiness, sadness, and humor in a unique way.  I've owned this album for more than 20 years now, and I still play it regularly.  I like to listen to it as a trip back to the 80s and my childhood, as well as the fact that it is just a great album.<br /><br />Money Changes Everything: 10/10-Great opening track with a rock sound.  Cyndi's voice is stellar.  Ever since I was a kid, I've been amazed by how she holds that note at the end.<br /><br />Girls Just Want to Have Fun: 10/10-An 80s anthem that everyone knows.  She put a feminist twist on this song and it worked great.  Of all the versions that have been released, by Cyndi herself too, the original remains the best.<br /><br />When You Were Mine: 10/10-A Prince song, the lyrics always have you wondering: is Cyndi's boyfriend cheating on her with another man?  It's unusual lyrics and great music make it another stand-out track.  I like the original, but Cyndi's version is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Time After Time: 10/10-My personal favorite on the album.  I never get tired of this ballad.  It has a lush sound to it.  It's a very 80s yet timeless song.<br /><br />She Bop: 7/10-I liked this one a lot more when I was a kid, before I found out the meaning of the song.  It's not exactly my type of lyrics, but Cyndi does it in her own humorous way which makes it okay.  The music is still good. Male bands have done songs like this, so why not a woman, and Cyndi is the best candidate to pull it off.<br /><br />All Through the Night: 10/10-Another memorable track.  Sometimes people think of this as a love song, but actually it has a sad meaning.  Still, it sounds romantic, with it's cascading synth and lush chorus.  Always loved the ending.<br /><br />Witness: 8/10-This is where the album takes a turn from hits you recognize to tracks you may not like so much.  Not as good as what was offered so far, but it's a fun little song with offbeat, wacky lyrics.<br /><br />I'll Kiss You: 7/10-I didn't like this track when I was a kid.  I thought it was kind of annoying.  I would basically shut off the tape at this point since these last few songs didn't interest me much.  A few years ago, I listened to it again and it just caught me in the right mood or something.  I really liked it.  It's funny and the music is kind of cool, especially near the end.<br /><br />He's So Unusual: 5/10-A short little reworking of a 20s song.  It's funny but not great.  The most memorable part for me is that they used a brief part of it at the beginning of the Girls Just Want to Have Fun video.<br /><br />Yeah Yeah: 5/10-My least favorite song on the album. I've never been crazy about this one and it still isn't one I play much.  Something about the lyrics and the way it's done doesn't appeal to me.  I don't hate it, it's just not a song I want to hear nearly as much as the rest of the album.  I prefer a b-side from the time called \\"Right Track Wrong Train\\", that song is better than this one, and probably should've replaced it or been added before it.  It's too bad that b-side was not added to this as a bonus track, because it fits in with the weird songs at the end of this album.<br /><br />Bonus tracks:<br /><br />Money Changes Everything Live: 8/10-very good but edited version.  The extended one is good too and worth finding.  That one gets a 9/10.<br /><br />She Bop Live: 5/10-I usually skip this one.  Fans of the song will like it.<br /><br />All Through the Night Live: 10/10-I love this one.  It's my favorite of the bonus songs.  It's also my favorite live version of ATTN that I've heard, even more than the Live in Paris one.  Something about it just brings me back to the 80s.  I feel like I'm actually at the 1984 concert from which it was taken.  I also love the way she sings at the end.  It's awesome.<br /><br />The sound quality of this remaster is great even though it's already pretty old.  The artwork in this edition is also nice.  It has some very cool pictures in it as well as a nice write-up on Cyndi's early career.  Lyrics are included too.  The only downside is that more bonus tracks were not included, such as the b-side I mentioned or maybe the extended mix of Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.<br /><br />I hope that another remastered/expanded version of this will be released, which contains Right Track Wrong Train, the extended version of Money Changes Everything Live, and the instrumental and remix versions of GJWTHF.  It's unlikely though, because in Japan they have released new versions of Cyndi's 80s albums, but the bonus material is seriously lacking.  An album like this and fans of it deserve lots of bonus treats.  But this one is a keeper regardless.  It's now priced low which is also great.  If you are new to Cyndi or 80s music collecting, this is a must have for your collection.cool pictures in it as well as a nice write-up on Cyndi's early career.  Lyrics are included too.

B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|A bit strange when you hear it first...because of the electro arrangements that are so different from Analogue (which you SHOULD buy if you like A-ha!) but then, some titles are really uplifting. \\"Nothing is keeping you here\\" is a definite treasure and \\"Real meaning\\" a pearl for Morten's soft voice.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter: The Third Season is the best of the series so far. Jimmy Smitts added so much to each episode.  I hope they have \\"star quality guests\\" each season.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Wow - what started out as a pensive listen, gathering mental notes and making comparisons here and there, has ended up in the 'click' that you often get after you finally decide you like an album. I love Alice in Chains, but while I would rate BGWtB as less groundbreaking or powerful than Dirt (obviously), and less creative than the self titled album, I think it is better than Jar of Flies & SAP, which don't really count as full albums, admittedly. Does that mean it's bad? Not at all - it's an excellent album, it is solid where the self titled was experimental with sound, and it is on par with Dirt in terms of quality.     In terms of of the tracklist, after a few listens and a little bit of time, you can appreciate the atmosphere of All Secrets Known, the chainsaw approach of Check my Brain, and be blown away by DuVall's vocals on Last of My Kind - probably one of the best songs on the album. Next up is Your Decision, sounding a little familiar as it opens as a Nutshell clone but still a nice song.     A Looking View and Acid Bubble form longer sections of typical AiC subdued sludge and creativity (maybe going on for TOO long in the case of A Looking View). I quickly gravitated towards Acid Bubble as another of the best songs here with its its haunting descent into an chugging chorus. I'm not too keen on When the Sun Rose Again, but I am yet to read the lyrics for this song. Lesson Learned and Take Her Out are reasonably good rock songs, although I am not quite convinced they sound entirely like AiC.     There isn't the same sort of confusion with Private Hell which is one of the albums 'downer' songs, once again sounding fairly familiar. The last song is a slow, soft burner but, while emotional, doesn't seem to have passion.    That appears to be a 'problem' over much of the album and most AiC fans will be able to pick it up almost immedietely, which forms the most of the albums downpoints. Cantrell is talented no doubt, but he just doesn't cut it in the emotion department. What is intended to sound sad just comes across as lifeless. Perhaps the decision to have Cantrell do most of the vox work has to do with who is the bands leader, but why not unleash DuVall who is eager to prove himself and has such incredible talent in his own right?     I was blown away by how good DuVall, both live on show and on the track Last of My Kind. Let's hope that AiC's next album really permits DuVall to participate as a full member rather than skirting the side lines in the shadow of Layne's ghost. This is the second flaw - the lack of exposure of DuVall.    The third and last 'flaw' - which is arguable - is the direction of some of the songs. While I generally don't see it as a problem, I did recognise that Get Born Again, one of AiC's last rockers before Layne's death had a decidedly specific subject matter and still a heavy yet energetic sound. The song appeared to attach organised religion - God was something Layne approached with despair in his music at times. No song here seems to carry that same sort of heaviness, sonically or in terms of subject matter. Rather they've perhaps straddled over some former AiC 'topics' while introducing a couple of songs with slightly lighter subject matter. This is forgiveable, and it's just an observation rather than a criticism. I'm not so sure AiC has retained their painful sincerity, but they've tried, and the concept of the album I believe revolves around an end to pain and a start to healing.    While I've spoken a little about the albums flaws, I really want to stress that the songs here do stand on their own as excellent in all ways. As with all AiC work, they often withstand the test of time and grow on you, well and truly for their blunt honesty, creative appeal, and their faith in standing well and truly alone amongst their contemporaries. Note I've still given it 5 stars, because it deserves to be judged on its own rather than against a legacy.    Overall, a definate purchase for any AiC fan,and a recommended purchase for anyone wanting honest, solid hard rock. I'm so happy to see this band back on their feet and I will see them live. I'm looking forward to hearing more of AiC in the future too. Till then, this disc as well as their others will become part of my favourites list. ;)
0143038419|5.0|The title of my review - \\"Where are you now?\\" - is what I've been asked or asked of anyone that has/is read this wonderful gem of a book. Part of the beauty of this book is its ability to resonate in every spiritual journey travvelerthat reads it.  The fact that it's an \\"Oprah\\" book never crossed my mind. In fact I didn't even know it was one of the Oprah books until after I'd read it. I however, enjoyed it tremendously. Elizabeth takes you through each of the \\"I\\" countries in a glorious fashion that makes you want to see what she sees and eat what she eats. I am anti-pizza, yet after reading her mouth watering descriptions of the pizzas in the little Italian town, made me want to fly there and try it. The book is a wonderful journey into the beautiful landscapes of India, Italy and Indonesia. The reader joins the author on her travels and savours every minute.  I related alot to her musings on meditation and transcending and this added to the fun. I too, used to feel like I could not meditate as deeply as some people did - or be as spiritually connected as some people are - and this book gave me hope that maybe I could reach nirvana !  A wonderful read whether you are on a spiritual journey or not - highly recommended !
B000001FSU|5.0|Not considered by most as ANTHRAX'S best , this has always been my favorite ANTHRAX cd.every song is great- no filler.From the beginning string piece into the powerful drum beat and head banging guitar cord sequence of 'Be All, End All through to such classics as 'Anti - Social'. Into heavier tracks as 'Misery Loves Company' in which once again Charlie Benate(drummer) puts an amazing beat mixed with a classic Dan Spitz(Lead Guitar) solo. Joe Belladonna's (Vocals) distinctive voice rings out, mere perfection for the band. 'Finale' is an amazing ending track to an great album. This is a must for any thrash metal fan.
B002KH4KSY|2.0|In 1984 Stephen King gave the world a reason to fear the children of Nebraska by writing Children of the Corn. Usually kids run around causing minor mischief pissing off a few parents here or there. However these kiddies are a bit different. Instead of the normal path, they form a murderous cult taking out every adult in sight. This is a concept that no doubt would reduce Santa to jif causing him to then swing his FTL's around over his head in a clear plastic bag. Since it has a good cult following the Sci-fi channel thought it must be a good idea to do a remake. Usually the remake idea never follows through well as was the case with Children of the Corn.<br /><br />In this version we have a couple, with their marriage on the rocks, taking a little road trip. As they cruise through the cornfields of Nebraska they plow down a kid who runs across the road. Obviously not helping the marriage counseling process. Now they're freaking out and notice the kid's throat was slit and decided to get all Tommy Boy on him by throwing him in their trunk. As they come to the next town they soon find a pack of little punk kids of supernatural sorts and are forced into battle. After about a half hour into the film it really starts to go downhill. The main characters acting gets way to corny as he challenges the kids using his military experience. It's quite hilarious to watch this guy get chased down by some kids as young as 7, not all being male.<br /><br />So in conclusion, the remake had nowhere near the effect the original had. There were some legit moments of enjoyment and even a couple laughs along the way. Unfortunately there wasn't enough to keep you interested. Even from a strictly B standpoint it couldn't work. Now we don't want to be too critical so have to  give some credit being that it was a sci-fi channel picture that was a cut above most. Compared to their usual disasters like Grizzly Rage or Mega Snake this one ranks high on their list. As far as a recommendation we can only say feel free to check it out when it's on t.v, but please don't spend $20 some odd dollars. Do like Santa would do and save it for a lap dance.l free to check it out when it's on t.v, but please don't spend $20 some odd dollars. Do like Santa would do and save it for a lap dance.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've always been a fan of tool, and this is the second album I have bought. this is not an album that you want to download, it is heavily wrapped up in a hard cardboard case, with built in stereoscope and fixed album artwork, causing it to appear 3d. the only problem i have with this album is the lack of lyrics and subdued vocals, making meanings (however ambiguous) unintelligible at times especially during rosetta stoned where they are rapidly sped up and distorted. overall a great album and a recommended buy for the physical copy.

B0021L8UXU|4.0|So many zombie movies seek to infuse the zombie genre with pathos, with a wry commentary on society or the human condition...basically taking themselves waaay too seriously for a film about dead bodies trying to eat people.  Zombieland does not suffer from such delusions.<br /><br />What Zombieland does right is revel in the chaos of a zombie apocalypse. The characters refuse to give themselves names (the better to avoid \\"personal attachments\\") and instead go by their intended destinations: Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) the nebbish shotgun-toting recluse, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) a professional zombie killer, the winsome Wichita (Emma Stone) and her kid sister Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). Each of them is trying to get somewhere, with vague hopes and dreams of finding family and solace.  But the reality, of course, is that the survivors have little hope of finding anyone alive, much less their loved ones.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it.  Oh, sure, there's some back story for each character, and a budding romance, but mostly Zombieland is an amusement park where zombies pop up and get smashed down like blood-filled pi&ntilde;atas.  It's also gut-wrenchingly gross, as every good zombie film should be.  There's so much blood and gore, it even spatters the screen.<br /><br />Throughout the film are hilarious rules for surviving a zombie apocalypse. It's as if Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide was grafted onto Evil Dead II. Columbus lives by these rules while Tallahassee regularly breaks them.  The explanation of these Rules and the victims who break them are half the fun.  And who can forget the Zombie Kill of the Week.  Tallahassee keeps trying, but he just can't be that nice old lady with the piano. Whenever Zombieland gets away from its main premise (you know, killing zombies) it falters a bit. A cameo by Bill Murray is funny but not THAT funny, and it drags the movie down.<br /><br />By far the best part of Zombieland is the zombies themselves.  The slow-motion introduction is a piece of performance art, instantly creating a story just by the placement of the zombies and the (inevitably) fleeing victim with a look of horror on his or her face.  By the time you see a guy in a bad suit running from a zombie stripper, you're in the right mood for Zombieland.<br /><br />If you like Twinkies, fear clowns, and always stretch before any strenuous activity, you might just have what it takes to survive Zombieland.

And with the little text next to the pics you can understand a bit more about the situation and the character involved.  A plus: the book is not too heavy so you can carry it around in your bag!

B00275EHCI|4.0|Let's get a couple of things straight: Surrogates is not a bad movie.  It is not anything like [[ASIN:B00275EH78 Gamer]], and yet Rotten Tomatoes has a spread of under 10 points between the two.  This is a crying shame. With Gamer and Surrogates coming out within months of each other, it's almost like Hollywood wanted desperately to make a Second Life movie but realized too late that Second Life is no longer cool.<br /><br />Surrogates has a lot in common with I, Robot and yes, Gamer. Implausibly, the world is dominated by remote-controlled robots, a parallel to Internet avatars.  Thanks to these robots, known as surrogates, crime is unheard of and the dream of a utopian society beckons. Of course, not everyone is okay with the status quo, including a radical group known as the Dreads. The Dreads are the underclass, people who don't believe in a robot-filled reality. Everyone else has become shut-ins, hiding in their bedrooms in their pajamas, living life through perpetually beautiful twenty-something robots.<br /><br />FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) and his partner Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) investigate a pair of murders in which the operators died too. There's just one problem: there are safeguards to protect operators from being harmed by the death of their surrogates. If word got out that surrogates were not immortal, the social fabric of modern society would fall apart.<br /><br />On screen, the surrogates are disturbingly perfect.  Their teeth is pearly white, their eyes without any hint of veins, their stubble-free skin cheeks are as rosy as a newborn's.  The robots (and thus, the actors portraying them) only move their heads when they talk, even when angry. Sights and sounds are softly muted. Until the real world hits and Greer is forced to come out of his shell.<br /><br />Willis' skill playing a sad sack and a scruffy loner are on full display here. Surrogates is as much about the increasing isolation of technology as it is about the wreckage of a marriage. As the stakes get higher, the movie becomes about the broken relationship between a husband and wife who were disconnected from each other long before surrogates were invented.<br /><br />If along the way it happens to involve some amazing special effects and a lot of cool action sequences, that's not such a bad thing.igher, the movie becomes about the broken relationship between a husband and wife who were disconnected from each other long before surrogates were invented.

1881273156|5.0|I was shocked when a marriage counselor showed me this book and recommended that my spouse and I read it.  The counselor said to first take the short test/assessment in the back of the book to figure out what your personal love language is, then read the rest.    This book is good at helping you understand what sort of actions say \\"I love you\\" to your spouse, or to you.  If your spouse is interested enough to look at your results, and perhaps take appropriate action, then your marriage can realize improvement.    It's simple, it's clear, it's a good place to start when your marriage doesn't seem to be going quite the way you had hoped.  The assessment in the back of the book  takes about 5 to 10 minutes tops to complete and then score.
0061689246|3.0|Stardust was a bit of a departure from Neil Gaiman's expected writing style. Here we have Gaiman's fairy tale; one that is meant to hold the interest of adult readers. It definitely is not one meant for \\"children's bedtime storytelling\\".<br /><br />Gaiman begins in the typical fairy tale fashion (but, thankfully without the hackneyed, \\"Once upon a time\\") explaining a fantasy land that is surrounded by a large stone wall (in fact, the village is called Wall) with only one opening with 2 guards. The people of the village are only allowed to leave through the guarded opening once every 9 years. This makes attentive readers wonder if Gaiman's intention is to relate this to some real-world political situation, but the story progresses in fairy-tale fashion and brings to light the fantastic quest which the main character, Tristran Thorn (the movie version calls him Tristan), must fulfill; as all fairy-tale main characters must.<br /><br />There are a few mature themes hinted at in the story such as sex, interest in a girl that takes a somewhat typical twist by the story's end, very aggressive sibling rivalry among a group of brothers (of whom only some are alive, but they're all at each other's throats, [\\"hmmm\\"...?]).  And there is an evil witch. It's very interesting how Gaiman used typical fairy-tale subjects, but used his gift of storytelling to make it all original and fanciful.<br /><br />Overall, Gaiman still stirs up the readers' imagination in his common method as they trek through Stardust with Tristran, but since it's a fairy tale and since Gaiman chose to use some typical themes of that genre, this story seems like it would be more alluring to young readers or to readers more easily wowed by events and techniques less imaginative than what readers encountered in the much more mature \\"Neverwhere\\", \\"American Gods\\", and \\"Anansi Boys\\".<br /><br />In my other reviews on Neil Gaiman I mentioned certain things he commonly referred to in all his stories, but he didn't delineate the history of a real-world location this time, nor does he have a long treatise on the tastes and smells of foods or a meal that I can remember this time around.l-world location this time, nor does he have a long treatise on the tastes and smells of foods or a meal that I can remember this time around.

B001RTKXM8|4.0|PARIS is a kaleidoscopic view of that great City of Light inhabited with a variety of individuals each of whom is consumed with life and love and living and dying. C&eacute;dric Klapisch has written and directed this richly populated canvas as a background of a tender story of a Moulin Rouge male dancer Pierre (Romain Duris) who is diagnosed with a terminal heart disease requiring transplantation if he is to survive. But in the end the many characters introduced in 'incidental stories' have become so interesting that, instead of providing simply a background for Pierre's portrait, they become an integral part of the drama as well as indelibly stamped on the viewer's mind.<br /><br />Pierre has kept his illness secret, yet when faced with the dire concept of a transplant he confides in his sister &Eacute;lise (Juliette Binoche), a single mother of three, who takes him in to fill his boring days of self confinement. There is a palpable magic between the two as &Eacute;lise attempts to bring Pierre out into the world of hope and of living. Incidental to her life are trips to the market where she observes the lives of the grocers and discovers their private lifestyles, information shared freely with the viewer. A Parisian North African communicates with his brother at home with a postcard of Paris, seducing the brother to brave all odds to come to the city. We also meet a jaded art historian Roland Verneuil (Fabrice Luchini) whose father has just died, an event that devastates his emotional brother Philippe (François Cluzet): Roland proceeds to have an affair with a student but his physical awakening is abruptly altered by the realities of Parisian life while Philippe progresses through his seemingly mundane existence toward a surprise ending. The grocers seek adventures with a group of girls among whom is the ex-wife of one of the men and in the process we observe the varying reactions of interpersonal relationships tested away from the eyes of group participation. All of these stories are white noise to Pierre's situation, and though &Eacute;lise is able to make Pierre 'dance again' at a party of his fellow dancers she organizes, in the end Pierre is left to care for &Eacute;lise's children while &Eacute;lise finally opens her frozen heart to a new romance. At this point Pierre receives the inevitable telephone call that a transplant is ready, and as he proceeds to the hospital he opens his mind to the beauties of Paris. Some of the vignettes we have observed are completed while most simply continue - just like life in the glorious city so often considered the city of love.<br /><br />All of the many roles are enacted by gifted actors, the cinematography offers us a different view of Paris than that of postcards and travel brochures, and the musical score ranges from popular music to the haunting 'Gnossiemme No. 1' of Erik Satie which is Pierre's theme music. At times the viewer feels lost in the complex overlay of the many stories being told, but settling back in a chair and just absorbing the film results in an evening of Parisian intoxication.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|I bought the iTunes version and if anything that is the way to go.  My friend has the store bought version and it's night and day.  iTunes has artwork the size of your computer screen (much larger than a CD booklet).  Also the iTunes LP release is like a DVD loaded with special features including: Music videos, interview videos, Australian tour re-cap, the making of 'Your Decision', rare photos, lyrics, credits/thanks, & CD booklet HUGE!  Also it includes 2 more songs: \\"Black Gives Way to Blue (piano mix)\\" & \\"Your Decision (live)\\".  The piano mix is a totally different arrangement on the guitars-the whole song- not just the piano is in a different key, to me the piano mix song is less 'country' and more melancholy than the original.  Also wow \\"Your Decision (live)\\" sounds so much better than the album version. Also it's not electric-it's acoustic so it sounds totally different from the album version as well.  Totally worth the $8.  The whole album is about Layne and I know Layne is smiling down because this album is beautiful.    Also I wanted to mention the Japanese edition of the album contains 1 bonus track \\"Down in a Hole (live)\\".  This version is incredible- William Duvall sings lead vocals and sings it his own way.  The lyrics are somewhat different and it sounds exactly how it should: Alice in Chains with a different vocalist which is essentially what AIC is now.
B0021L8US0|5.0|Every once in a BIG while, perhaps only a few of times each decade, that rare film comes completely out of left field to let us know that there are still some original ideas out there, and that cinema can still be fresh and exciting. DISTRICT 9 is just such a film. And how.<br /><br />Historically, science fiction has been a special genre of choice for socially conscious tales that put our struggles into perspective through fantastical storytelling; The Day the Earth Stood Still did it with nuclear weapons, Planet of the Apes did it with race relations, and now District 9 does it with the topic of refugees. These are the kinds of films born of a storyteller's concern for humanity, and because of that, they resonate beyond our usual selfish childish hopes for sci-fi thrills. Don't get me wrong, I love sci-fi and everything that it implies like, in this case, extreme violence, gore and extraterrestrial paraphernalia. But strong, disturbing, deep drama is essential in any genre.<br /><br />Compelling, captivating, occasionally hilarious, and refreshingly unpredictable thanks to a smartly structured script that builds impressive momentum, District 9 surprises at every turn while holding a mirror to society in a way that will likely find the film ranking favorably amongst the best of the genre. Perhaps it's a blessing in disguise, but let's not go too far. It has its flaws despite the sheer innovations. In order to give this monumental task the precise and necessary touch of realism and credibility, the documentary style mixed with the straight line real-life focus can be, let's say, uncomfortable. Quick and fuzzy  images proper of the portable camera tend to loose that visual focus, but NEVER the interest despite the slight annoyance. I tell you, nobody will leave their seats, and my suggestion is to buy popcorn and soda in advance, every minute is precious and important.<br /><br />Going back to this new born masterpiece, let's get to the plot: It's been 28 years since an giant alien spacecraft came to a standstill over the city of Johannesburg, South Africa. After cutting their way into the ship to find a million malnourished extraterrestrials, authorities ushered them down to  and set them up in District 9, a makeshift refugee camp that quickly became a junkyard, replete with crime, vice, and overcrowding. The locals want the aliens gone, and a private firm called MNU (Multi-National United) has been assigned the task of evicting them to what is, essentially, a concentration camp. Heading up this mission is Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), a bumbling bureaucrat who essentially serves as a figurehead for MNU, which is more concerned with harnessing the visitors' highly advanced technology and weaponry than looking out for their well-being. While evicting the aliens, referred to as \\"prawns\\" due to their resemblance to humanoid shrimps, Wikus is inadvertently exposed to their biotechnology, prompting a strange metamorphosis that makes him the most wanted man on the planet.<br /><br />For me the most remarkable aspect in this movie was the perfect balance between an insightful review of the human condition and the astonishing display of special effects, not to mention the constant wild speculation. Director Neil Blomkamp  never lets  one to go on top of the other, and just when we're starting to hope for a mood switch ...BOOOM! There comes the old fashioned in-your-face sci-fi action. Things never start to get grim anyhow, and the real thrill is guessing where the story goes. But in order to project a full quality product, I must say the movie smartly satisfies our needs by disarming humor and blowing us from our seats. The south african underground guerrilla atmosphere is just perfect, and I totally agree with the extreme polarization of the characters, making it more digestible with effortless efficiency.<br /><br />The creature and tech design may not exactly escape the regular standards, but makes perfect sense because itsnot the main issue here. I mean come on, sci-fi design is not going through an enlightenment period these days. Besides, we obtain way more than we can possibly expect, if artful realism is indeed the goal here. But like i said, the faults of the visual style combined with a subjective vision of traditional narrative may disturb. It makes you wonder about the Blu-ray version of this film.<br /><br />My strongest recommendations for sci-fi artists and movie lovers in general. A solid four and a half for this turning point of the genre in this early century., sci-fi design is not going through an enlightenment period these days. Besides, we obtain way more than we can possibly expect, if artful realism is indeed the goal here.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|Inarguably the greatest singles artist of the last quarter century, Madonna was also no slouch in the video department either, as this generous, if incomplete, 47 track collection attests to.  The first thing that sticks out for me is the tracklisting itself, which manages to skip over some highly essential Madonna videos--\\"Oh Father\\", \\"Bad Girl\\"(probably her worst single EVER but a gorgeous video), \\"Fever\\", \\"Drowned World/Substitute For Love\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\", all represented on previous video compilations, are absent here and considering that the former two are two of the most artistically stunning videos ever filmed gives one pause as to why they didn't see the light of day on this collection; I find it hard to believe they couldn't have somehow been squeezed on to this  set. Also, as many have pointed out, an edited \\"Justify My Love\\" appears--at this juncture, there really doesn't seem to be any reason to even include it if it isn't the original, unedited version.  Also absent is either version of \\"American Life\\"(probably Madonna's SECOND WORST single ever), but again it would have been nice for completion's sake. As for the picture quality, I'll agree it's not optimum though the sound quality here is absolutely fantastic.  Overall, considering there was room for 47 videos, it would have been nice to see at least three of the aforementioned tacked on for good measure but as such this is as complete as you're going to get in one place.
0802798225|5.0|Imagine \\"Grease\\" meets \\"West Side Story\\" and you've got Perfect Chemistry. Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fuentes and Brittany Ellis are both quite perplexed when they are forced to be chemistry partners. He is a Mexican gangbanger with tattoos and a bad reputation. She is the white head cheerleader with a serious need for perfection.    Alex has Brittany pegged as a bimbo with too much money and not enough sense. After being challenged in a bet, Alex starts to put the moves on Brittany. With her relationship with high school football star Colin in the dumps, she doesn't mind playing with Alex's head a little. Neither of them expects the reaction that they create.    Being forced to spend time together working on their project gives them a chance to catch a glimpse into each others' lives. What they find out about each other not only gives them insight in to the other person's behavior, but it also gives them insight into their own lives. Things start to heat up in their private lives with an escalation that can't be missed.    Something in the way this book is written just absolutely sucks you in. The characters are very likable and relatable, while maintaining their believability. A big selling point is that this book is writen about a sunject that many teens can relate to. Gangs are a prevalent problem, but a \\"necessary\\" one for many teens looking to protect themselves and their families. This story takes a hard look at the reality of the danger, but also the hope that is always present no matter how hard the situation.
1407109421|2.0|This is a 3 book series of some fantastically written fiction about life in made-up, intermingling worlds different than our own, but with many similarities. The first book of the trilogy, Northern lights, was so good I got the second book as soon as I finished it. The second book, The Subtle Knife, hinted at the books main plot and because it was a very twisted view of some very real beliefs I was hoping the author was going to redeem himself by the end of the 3rd book and not continue in what he seemed to be implying. He could have, he's a brillant writer, but he didn't. 30 pages into the 3rd book, The Amber Spyglass, and I was ready to put the book down. It was rather disappoining that he was going down the road he was, but I was too curious, I really had enjoyed it up until this point. I still hoped he could make it all right by the end, though it seemed improbable. Maybe I was just fooling myself trying to justify why I was still reading it. Whatever the reason, I continued reading. However, because the thrill was gone the book became laborious to read, too many violent killings happening too many times; too many detailed descriptions of too many scenes. Still I finished it and the ending was sweet. BUT, the end doesn't justify the means, the author had an agenda and I felt like it was a sneaky, underhanded way of imposing it on his readers, or at least, this reader. That part was not fiction, it was quite clear that the author hates the church in general and God specifically. He made evil good and God a liar and humanism, no matter what you have to do to achieve it, the most important. Of course, if you don't believe in God, if you don't love him, it doesn't matter, enjoy the book. I'm one who loves the Lord and Pullmans agenda ruined the whole series.

It's a fabulous roller coaster ride written by one of the most entertaining authors to have ever put a pen to paper.<br /><br />In addition to a smooth writing style, Brown's meticulous research and unfailing attention to detail are what sets him apart from most of his contemporaries.<br /><br />You'd have to be living under a rock for the past several years not to be familiar with Robert Langdon, Brown's mega-smart Harvard symbologist, and the hero of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\"<br /><br />Langdon's best friend and mentor Peter Solomon, the wealthy scion and head of the Smithsonian Institute, urgently needs him to speak at a gala held every year to honor the institute's most generous donors.<br /><br />\\"The problem is this,\\" Solomon's able assistant pleads with Langdon. \\"Our speaker has fallen ill and has just informed us she will be unable to give the address. ... This means we are desperate for a replacement speaker and Mr. Solomon is hoping you would consider filling in.\\"<br /><br />Solomon's office sends a private plane and arranges for a limo to deliver Langdon to the National Statuary Hall, \\"the best room in all of D.C.,\\" for the speech.<br /><br />Imagine Langdon's surprise when he arrives at his destination and discovers he's alone in the great hall. He's led to a horrific clue in the Capitol's rotunda, and thus begins a race to save his friend's life, despite interference from capitol police, the CIA's top brass and a very twisted villain who will stop at nothing to realize his dark dream of unification.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but suffice it to say the gruesome nature of the clue haunted me long after the book ended. I kept thinking the clue wasn't real ... or wasn't really what it was ... I kept hoping it was a sick joke played on Langdon by the book's bad guy, but no such luck. It was the real thing. Yipes and yuck!<br /><br />Before long, Langdon's on the run, joined by Solomon's sister, Katherine, a noetic* scientist and director of \\"the world's largest and most technologically advanced museum ... hous[ing] more pieces than the Hermitage, the Vatican Museum, and the New York Metropolitan ... combined.\\"<br /><br />Langdon and Katherine team up to follow clue after hidden clue, save Solomon's life and stop the mad man who always seems to be one step ahead of them.

It was a rip-roaring ride. I figured out early on who the villain was and why he was driven to do what he did, but it did not distract from plot.

B001GQSY64|3.0|The Clone wars is a good movie to watch with your kids, but otherwise, the story is actually boring. The star wars movies are more exciting and interesting than this cartoon. Visually, the movie looks great but some of the characters are very poorly written. The main female character is a brat and the female villain is inept, so the writers need more character development as well as story development.    What I could not understand, is how the Republic (the good guys) are trying to win the favor of Jabba the Hutt, who was one of the villains in Return of the Jedi. In Jedi, Jabba was bad guy who wanted Han Solo dead or alive, and had no problems throwing the good guys in monster-infested traps but here, he is a giant lump who has resources that both the Jedi and Sith want to win their side of the war. I can understand how the Jedi might want to try to negotiate but the point of being a villain is to do bad things. It would make more sense if Count Dooku was trying to take over Jabba's resources by force and the Jedi tried to prevent that, but alas, in the end, it is only a kids movie.    The Blu-ray looks great on a 1080p tv, the sound is fantastic, the extra features are nice and this is the kind of movie to escape reality for awhile and can bring up interesting discussions (with both star wars and casual fans alike) so it is okay.
B000YI7MRM|5.0|I highly recommend this movie.  The scenery is fabulous, everything looks like a Velasquez painting.  The story is interesting and Viggo brings the beloved Alatriste to life.    The acting is top-notch.  The movie is in Spanish with English sub-titles.      If you want to spend a couple of hours watching a good, old-fashioned swashbuckling adventure, this is the movie for you.    It may even lead you back to the books which are excellent.
0312383436|4.0|This is the first Madeleine Wickham book I have read and I have to say that I really enjoyed.  Milly is a very sympathic character and you really want things to work out for her.  Some people will say that no one could be as naive as Milly who truly believes if you don't talk about unpleasant things they aren't happening.  I know several people like this in real life and can imagine them acting the same way.      In some ways the story lines aren't anything new:  Milly tries to behave the way she thinks Simon wants her to, Simon hates his father because he abandoned him and his mother only to come back into life when he was an adult, Simon feels inferior to his millionare father, Milly's mother acts like Milly is still 14, Milly's father prefers his \\"career girl\\" older daughter over flakey Milly.  These are not new family dynamics. Etc...      What really made this book interesting was the story line between Allan and Rupert.  Their love story is very believable and touching.     There were several character story lines that could have been omitted to make a tighter story.  The whole Esme story line was un-needed as was the one between Isobel and Harry.    The main theme of the book is being who you are and not what you think others want you to be.  It's a good theme for all of us.
B0013FXWU6|2.0|This movie was well produced and well acted. But the story is a bummer. I felt neither pity nor sympathy for any of the protagonists. The movie held my interest but at the end I was sorry I had watched it.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Very good animation, decent story-line, not the best movie ever but its worth it if your at all a fan of the prior FF series. If you liked it when it came out your going to love it now. It looks amazing in blu-ray and would strongly advise purchasing it. Only problem was there is nothing but the movie. Would have liked something to come with it...anything for that matter besides the disk. If you looking for a blu-ray version to pop in with you collector's edition though its perfect.

She does not need the money.  Is it the Whitney of her youth? NO.  But it is the new adult Whitney.  Wonderful.
B002GU5V24|5.0|Was (Is?) Genesis the greatest live band of all time? Well, perhaps not the greatest, but pretty darn good.  This box set re-offers their live catalog in sonically improved versions that capture much of what made them such a special live band - one that I saw almost 30 times over the decades. Certainly the set is not perfect, the Seconds Out glitches are as reported - although I'd suggest they are minor rather than major - and a 5.1 version of Three Sides Live would have been nice.
0547258305|4.0|This book was delightful fantasy. I found it completely original and fascinating. I loved the characters, I loved the story, and I loved the adventure. I was wrapped up completely. Completely.<br /><br />However, I am naming it only a \\"semi-squeaky book\\" for two reasons:<br /><br />1. I felt that the story was a little lost. I recognize that the characters themselves felt lost throughout the book, but it just didn't feel as strong as it could be.<br /><br />2. The main character, Katsa, doesn't like the idea of marriage. I really hoped that she'd come around to the idea... but she didn't. I'm not sure what I think of that. It wasn't bad, just... not what I expected. I know that some people really think that, and that's fine. I fully respect everyone's opinion to have an opinion. My opinion, however, did not fit Katsa's.<br /><br />That's it. Other than that it was a wonderful book. I loved the idea of the graces. Fascinating. Completely.<br /><br />[...]
0385504225|2.0|Ok, so I know that the first two Robert Langdon novels weren't exactly easy to believe....but when I say \\"far-fetched\\" I'm more referring to Brown's explanations. He seems to really be reaching with a lot of the comparisons that he's making in this book. On top of that, he just feels the need to repeat the same argument over and over, until you feel like screaming, \\"Alright, I get it!\\" This is blatantly apparent towards the end of the book.     Brown's writing ability has never been spectacular, but at least with the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons, you were so caught up in the plot and so busy turning pages, it was hard to notice. Now, with the repetitive nature of this book, it becomes much more noticeable. As for the predictable comment....I'm not going to give anything away, but I will say that if you pay a little bit of attention to the way he words certain phrases in the book, you can see one of the big \\"twists\\" in the end coming from a mile away. Lastly, I was very disappointed in the ending of this book. With his last few books (i.e. the Da Vinci Code), Brown seemed to have found a way to leave the reader very satisfied after hundreds of pages of nonstop suspense. With this ending, I feel he has gone back to the feel of a C-list movie like in some of his earlier works (i.e. Deception Point).    Let's just hope this was the fluke in the Robert Langdon chain, because I really did enjoy the other 2 novels.
0385341008|2.0|This book provides an easy way to learn the history of the War and the area.  Many facts new to me were presented.  At times, it was a bit confusing as to which person was writing.  However, I enjoyed the diary format.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|Excellent lyrics, signature guitars, reminds me of the old days of Skynard.  I especially love the local references to their roots in the songs that most folks outside of N. Fla might not get.    Great job, boys!  I hope you keep cranking these out for many more years.
B002QQ8HAG|4.0|Great and fun documentary! What a treat to see inside this magazine. I went to learn more about Anna Wintour and I came out of this movie feeling like I developed a nice understanding of her - as much as one can from a film. She has a tough job. She is in a brutal industry (two actually: Fashion and Publishing) and she clearly cares about fashion and Vogue. Frankly. I see men who act FAR tougher than she, and no one gives them frosty nicknames. So what if she does not smile all the time? Half that industry has so much Botox, there is not too much smiling going on anyway.<br /><br />Grace is the one who you come out of the movie wanting to have dinner with. She is talented, brilliant, warm, tough, and her photo shoots are amazing! There were moments where she just radiates warmth and insight so effortlessly, even when she is just taking in a gorgeous view of Paris. You can see how such an interesting person can produce such great art. The cost of the movie ticket was worth it just to see some of her photos that did not make it into the magazine. I hope they make a movie of her life, with plenty of her in it!<br /><br />The bottom line: Anna sees fashion as an industry. Grace sees fashion as an art. Both are correct. There are only brief scenes with people from the fashion industry, and only slight glimpses of fashion shows... but that is fine. This is a film about Vogue, not designers.<br /><br />ANY artist in any field can appreciate this film. It is about passionate artists who are doing great things.

B002JM1VJG|2.0|It's mind boggling why some notable videos are absent (Drowned World, Nothing really matters, Oh Father, Fever, American Life). The videos that are here are mostly great and represent a genuine music revolution that we now take for granted. The sound has been remastered wonderfully. These videos have never sounded so good. The problem is that they have never looked so bad. Seriously they are VHS quality at best. The compression is terrible. Everything is fuzzy and there is frequent pixel problems. Warner Brothers should be ashamed for putting out such a dreadful product. You'd think an artist of Madonna's stature would warrant a higher quality release, but it is what it is. In addition to very poor video quality there are no liner notes, commentaries or background information about the videos.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|The powers that be changed some things, but they're barely noticable.  In all ways that matter this movie is fundamantally as the miniseries it stemmed from.  The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because there's a 5 volume directors set coming out later this year & found this out after getting this version.
B00005AG7K|3.0|this movie is great but the picture quality is not that good. You get what you pay for.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Some of the twists are extream but I loved every one of them.  A great fast paced read that was very satisfying. I loved it.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I had pretty high expectations based on all the reviews, but I found it to be very underwhelming.  The best I can say is that he seemed to be \\"trying\\" very hard to make a point - one that could have been made in 2 pages - So much of one's success is because of seemingly insignificant breaks they receive.  The message seemed to be one of almost victim-hood.
0307588335|4.0|I know about the market as much as anyone who does not have the means of financial power to get involved. The financial terminology, which I believe is purposely made difficult to understand in order to fool and lure any regular Joe into believing the investor, is foreign to me. I appreciate the author for doing his best to explain certain terminology and the mechanism behind each one. The book was exactly what I expected: an employee's overview of the situation. It made clear in my mind why Lehman collapsed, why other banks in their situation did not, why greed was the foundation of our actual mess, why great people have the personalities to step aside due to self-valor.  The only thing that disappointed me about the author was when he suggested that the government should have saved the bank. He must be a hard core capitalist, Wall Street investor with only the desire to make it big or be eaten alive. I don't think that the people at Lehman suffered. All of them made big money, way more money in a few years than many people in a lifetime. Yes, we all want security and guaranties, but there are no guaranties in life. Things change and the big brother should not interfere.<br /><br />I appreciate the fact that he shows a lot for respect for his friends, people that worked with or capable people that mean and do good, although they were not necessarily very close to the author. All in all the book is a great lecture for the weekend, easy to read and form an opinion over the past events.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|Wow what a great Ben-Hur (minus the Christian theme) faux type film. Crowe makes this film a real triumph and the action-fighting scenes are great but is it me or were the Gladiator fights filmed too fast as in they were over before they began.

This is a great video for beginners because she shows you a lot of modifided movements but it still whoops your butt. I did the full 30 days and I still continue to use it as part of my workout through out the week. I'm stronger, thinner, and cut up after doing the Shred. Furthermore, I've purchased 2 other JM videos and found this one to be great to start out with if you're not a regular at the gym.

B00261OXUY|5.0|I've really gotten into The Tudors with Amazon Unbox, watched Seasons 1 and 2 within a few weeks. While it may not be entirely historically accurate, it is extremely interesting and excellent drama. Episode 10 of Season 2 was intense, to say the least. Of course, we all know that Anne Boleyn was beheaded, but the way this episode was done was extremely well acted, filmed, written, all the above. I disliked Anne from the start, she was scheming and manipulative and power hungry. But in this episode, I actually felt sorry for her. Her execution was delayed not once, but twice after she was mentally prepared for it. She watched the rest of her friends and family get beheaded, saw her father turn away from her.<br /><br />I cried and cried through the last 1/2 hour of this episode and, even when it was over, I couldn't stop crying for another 15 minutes, I found it just that intense and sad. If ever an episode and actors should have been nominated for an Emmy, this one single episode should have won hands down.<br /><br />I can't wait until The Tudors Season 3 is available for download, I'm going through withdrawals! Oh, and Henry Cavill who plays Charles Brandon has to be one of the hottest, best looking men I've ever seen. Absolutely gorgeous!

B0006GAOBI|4.0|Director: Richard Kelly<br />Writer: Richard Kelly<br />Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, Noah Wyle<br /><br />Donnie Darko has become a modern cult classic. It is Richard Kelly's masterpiece (at least from a screen writing perspective), and easily Jake Gyllenhaal's most famous role.<br />The movie follows troubled teenager Donnie Darko's experiences in the weeks after a jet engine falls from a phantom plane and crashes into his room while he is out for the night. He then begins to have some odd visions and out of body experiences. He starts experiencing the world, or rather the universe, in a very different way.<br />For me, this movie blends many different concepts into one bizarre, very visual, sometimes disturbing, and occasionally hilarious creation. It is a tale of existential philosophy and interdimensional time travel, full of paradoxes, and has some intense, deep meanings if you care to dig enough (and see it more than once).<br />With the major exeptions of Jena Malone's character and Gyllenhaal's masterful performance (only his second lead role, after 1999's October Sky), the acting and directing are nothing special. The set and costume design evoke something of a Stepford Wives or Edward Scissorhands visual vibe. They both compliment this idea of a very dark story taking place in a \\"perfect\\" suburban setting. However, the real reason to watch this movie is for the story and the evolution of Gyllenhaal's character into something metaphysically aware, and possibly posthuman.<br /><br />Final Score: 7/10
0062515675|5.0|This book was a fantastic read. From the first minute I picked it up, I didn't want to put it down!  This book was so motivating and inspiring! The Author was able to break down the complexity of life, and help to simplify things. The teachings in this book are very extreme, giving up everything and moving away to the high mountains, all to find a better life... However, it gives you the motivation to change some aspects of your life, and recognise what is cluttering up your life.  When reading this book, embrace everything that is told, get lost in Journey, and only then think about the changes you can make in your life while you are reflecting this fantastic fable.  There is a moment in peoples life when they are ready to make a big change,  this book is the stepping stone for those people!  I'm 20 years old and this book gave me the motivation to Give up smoking and join the gym! :-)  If you do happen to read it, PLEASE let me know what you think!
B00005YU1O|3.0|Director: Richard Linklater<br />Writer: Richard Linklater<br />Starring: Wiley Wiggins, Bill Wise, Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Alex Jones, Richard Linklater, John Christensen<br /><br />\\"What the hell is this guy talking about?\\" I thought that exact phrase about 15 times throughout this movie. Combine very abstract visual animations of live action video with very existential and philosophical monologues and dialogues and you have Waking Life. You will probably need to see it at least twice to fully absorb everything.<br />There is a very loose story. Willy Wiggins is getting lectures from or talking with various people about the nature of reality and the meaning of life, and the whole thing is animated. There isn't really a beginning, middle, or end, just a series of conversations or monologues. At times it feels like a really weird, artsy documentary.<br />Even though some of the scenes are ostensibly conversations, the characters don't talk normally, the way you or I would. The all feel very scripted, and to me the bizarre animations are covering up what is probably some very bad acting, or at least unconvincingly delivered lines of philosophical dialogue.<br />If you like artsy movies or want your mind blown off the chart, then this movie is probably for you. After a few scenes of re-defining the nature of reality, I found myself desensitized to what the characters were trying to say. You aren't really given time to digest the significance of each character's point of view before you're thrust with another, and I didn't feel that the artsy animation style really added anything to what the characters said. More often than not I found it unnecessary or even distracting.<br /><br />Final Score: 6/10

B001H9JBW6|5.0|A series that is a prodigiously well-knit plot, so well-knit that we can wonder what the truth is in the end. It is a lot more than just a rewriting of Big Brother with all the cameras everywhere and the tracking chips in the shoes, belts, or even under the skin. All that is covered up by the imposed ID card which is supposed to concentrate opposition while the necessary software are tested to identify the eyes, the finger prints, the figure and who knows what else of every single person. The new generation of trackers are infinitesimally small molecules injected or simply incorporated in the body of a person even be it only via a drink and then the person is tagged for life, and even beyond. The series here shows how an experiment went wrong, not really wrong but actually came out dirty. A set of these tags were injected to thousands of refugees in Afghanistan in some kind of innocuous medical injection, and that tag had the capacity to recognize the genes of the person and then to kill one particular human family, Arabs in that case. The film on such a point is badly informed since in Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan the people are of Indo-European stock and not Semitic, and wrong again if you wonder how such a tracker can make the difference between a Jewish Semite and an Arab Semite? But never mind such details. They were testing a genetic weapon that could annihilate a whole population in a few days, in other words an illegal genocidal genetic weapon. They even doubled up the demonstration by making the only British citizen who got the tag recover within twenty-four hours. So Big Brother is becoming there Big Western War Criminal. And the West wonders then where these middle-easterners and far-easterners find their terrorist ideas. In our security laboratories, and no where else. But the series has another interest. It shows the inside picture of that kind of security experimentation and we find out that there are at least four or five levels and that most people have one foot in more than one level and often in three levels. The last scene is typical. Michael, the NGO worker who was the ultimate guinea pig of the tag is executed on the ship that is leaving Britain by the man who helped all along Michael, his Brother Stephen and his wife Yasim, and we discover that he who appeared to be a freelance fighter to avenge his own daughter is in fact a multiple agent working for the secret and totally undercover circle of the security services of the government. That gives to the series an interesting twinge. Note that tag was also used against illegal immigrant who were infected in a way or another and died within days. Actually the doctor of this experiment manages to find a cure but he is eliminated in due time and all evidence destroyed. The experiment had been a full success. Let's keep that in reserve. The final element is the sentimental level. Michael is officially killed and buried and Stephen comes back from China for the funeral. Yasim, Michael's wife is then ripped between the dead husband and his brother, and the brother is divided between his brother's wife and his brother's widow. One of the side effects of that false death and burial is that Stephen is brought back to England and then will no longer be able to leave, hence will be forced to work for the government. So even the wife torn between two brothers is not really dramatic, certainly not tragic. It is one more level of political plotting. But altogether the series is interesting and even fascinating, British in one word in that genre of political science fiction.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDhave one foot in more than one level and often in three levels.

0307588335|5.0|An excellent book that I highly recommend. For those who thought the meltdown at Lehman Brothers was unforeseeable or that the Fed should have bailed Lehman out, this book will eliminate those thoughts. The author makes a very compelling case for the incompetence of Richard Fuld and other senior Lehman executives. I would recommend skipping over the first 60-70 pages which are dedicated to the author and his background in the securities industry.  But the rest of the book is a \\"10\\" on a scale of 1 to 10.       Andrew Stoltmann
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I've been listening to this over and over.  I love it.  My only complaint is that I wish the song Will You Be There, was the full length version.  The packaging was good too; it had a lot of great pictures of him throughout the years.
B000056HE9|4.0|.....This is a nice Christmas story in the Vein of Miracle on 34TH Street or It's a Wonderful Life with Angels and a happy ending.  However I think Sam Goldwyn should have stuck to his guns when he proposed that Cary Grant play the Bisop and that David Niven play the Angel.  I don't know what arguement Grant used on Goldwyn to get him to change his mind but if I were Niven, I would have been furious.  The part of Dudley \\"the angel\\" was a plum part and Niven had it stolen right from under his nose.  I deducted one star for what I consider to be a casting mistake.    .....With an all star cast and good dialogue this is a very enjoyable film and the DVD is a quality transfer.  Loretta Young was 34 and coming to the end of a very sucessful movie career when this movie was made but she still retained the radiant beauty that made her a top movie star and a soon to be successful TV star as the host of the Loretta Young show. For Loretta Young fans this movie is a must have for your collection.

B000W91RUG|5.0|I didn't start watching Big Bang when it first appeared on television, and now see how silly that was.  This is a great show with a completely different brand of comedy than I've seen anywhere else.  Some of the jokes can go over people's heads who aren't very into math and/or science, but it's still easy to determine they are hilarious.  This first season is very fun, and I can't wait to purchase the second season.
1400063515|2.0|I have had this sitting on my Kindle for a month, and was really looking forward to it. What a disappointment!

055380684X|4.0|When I first got Guitar Hero, I played on Easy mode for a long time. I tried Medium but I did pretty badly so I went back to Easy mode.<br /><br />On a whim, I tried Hard mode. I failed miserably. However when I went back to Easy it seemed too easy. I went to Medium and did reasonably well. How could I have gotten better so quickly, just from one partial game at Hard level?<br /><br />_The Talent Code_ explains why.<br /><br />The key is to play at a level that's challenging, observe your mistakes, and figure out how to improve. I think we've known this for a while. But this book tells the tale well, and also ties it into three other topics: how skills show up in the brain (myelin), passion, and coaching. So for me it was both enjoyable and inspiring. It's not an academic book that you'll refer to a decade from now but it's something to read on the airplane or on a nice lazy afternoon.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|I always thought that some of these cuts were the Beatles at the top of their game--Strawberry Fields, All You Need is Love, I Am the Walrus.  So I bit and bought the remaster.  I knew I'd listen to this a lot, especially if it were really different.  First of all, I do a lot of listening in my car--good sound system and I enjoy the bubble of sound.  Threw this in and sure it sounded like MMT, but it didn't sound any different from the digitized copy of the vinyl I made a few years ago.  I finally had a few hours to myself, and I decided to try the remastered back to my steady digitized vinyl on my sound system.  My wife was out, the stereo was pumped up to its potential.  Were the two recordings different?  Yes.  The remaster certainly was louder and had definite separation from the vinyl.  Did it make me want to go out and spend a lot of money on my other Beatles recordings?  No.  Excuse me, but I can't make believe that it's like hearing a recording for the first time.  It's not.  We all know every note.  For a bit more of bass tone, or for the voice to be clearly on the right speaker, it just seems like a Magical Mystery Monte Game to replace a lot of recordings.
0385504225|1.0|Sadly, this book may mean that Dan Brown is a one trick pony.  Yes, it is his third major book, his third best seller but in all reality his first full novels Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code are but one book.  Angles and Demons was the birth of an idea and The Da Vinci Code the polished refinement of but one theme.    So The Lost Symbol is arguably his true second main stream work and it is one riddled with weakness.  Robert Langdon has become a shadow of the bright Harvard educator we had glimpsed in his the former stories.  In the moment of his most telling test Mr. Brown turns Robert Langdon into the weakest of protagonists and at the same time makes the man tempered in the fire of anti-matter and whose intelligence was tested under the highest levels of duress...  a fool.      During Mr. Langdon's test of character he had control over his own fate and he failed himself and poor Ms. Solomon by giving away the very secret that would have saved them.  Iron willed silence it the face of his own death coupled to the wisdom that his silence would force his captor to save the life of the one man who could solve the riddle is what we expect from the brave and bright Mr. Langdon.  Instead we are introduced to a coward without intelligence.  He is not the figure whose persona has been fired by the deeds from the other stories.  This Robert held the winning hand and folded under pressure while knowing his weak subjugation would surly lead to his death.  In this fight or flight situation he could not flee, he decided not to fight and instead meekly surrendered his only weapon, \\"silence\\" and his life.  He did this under the same pressures he had already faced and overcame in Italy, France and Great Britain...  So the question becomes who is this Robert Langdon and why does he lack the backbone he displayed in Angels and Demons or The DaVinci Code.    Between this unrecognizable Robert Langdon and the other weak scenarios in this novel poor Dan Brown comes across as alost novelist forced to fulfill his contracts with a story so poorly done that I'm sure he can not be proud of its writing.    Oh yes, if your foolish enough to buy and read this work reflect on this one thought...  THE STORY ENDS OH SO MANY PAGES BEFORE THE BOOK DOES.    You'll understand this if you read it...  Dan Brown tends to run on and on, long after the story is over!
B0025KVLTC|5.0|The Beatles Rubber Soul was a fantastic album! They were surely responding to The Beach Boys great songs and harmonies. The Beach Boys, responding in kind gave us the fantastic Pet Sounds! Which in turn created The Beatles \\"Revolver\\"! These two bands were and are the greatest bands in history! And the albums in this period are forever locked into the greatest music ever made!
0738702994|4.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this deck, but there are a few flaws. One is, only the major arcana is very detailed.<br />It's like she decided \\"oh crap, I have to finish a bazillion cards but  I really don't have time to refine the image, I think a quick sketch with water color will be ok for the minor arcana. It's not as important.\\" When I bought this deck, I was under the impression *all* the cards were beautifully painted and intricately detailed, but that is not so.<br />Another thing is, the cards are a bit large- width and length wise. By the way, from what I read from the other reviews, people were saying the cards are \\"slippery\\", I personally don't think so.<br />I't is also important to note that the deck is based off of the Raider Waite (with some alterations), so if you, like me have that deck, it's like you are already familiar with the cards.<br />Another thing, the book that comes with the deck is BRILLIANT. There  is a bunch of great information on the cards, it's definitely useful and great to read. (There are 264 pages.)<br /><br />With all it's flaws I am very happy with this deck, I found it to be very accurate when using it and am glad I chose it. I can see myself passing down this deck to my children one day!
0385504225|1.0|I listened to this book on CD. This book is so silly that it was great listen to on a road trip so that I could make fun of the bad writing and laugh my head off.  When he starts preaching the Gospel according to Dan Brown toward the end of the CD I just turned it off. I'm so glad that I had checked this out at the library and not spent money on it, otherwise I wouldn't think it was so funny.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Ok. I am a hardcore Madonna fan, and the only reason I gave it 4 starts is because it is mostly a compilation of videos I already own. But, there are some others I never had or even seen before, example: Erotic.  I have to say I was also expecting a better quality on the pictures, but I don't notice a difference among the other DVD's and this one. Anyway, just waiting for the release of the Sticky and Sweet tour video.
B0002858YS|5.0|\\"I GOT SOUL BUT I'M NOT A SOLDER\\"  \\"... ready lets rolls onto something new! ...\\"  You gotta embrace new songs.    At first I bought this album mainly because it had Mr. Brightside on it. Popped it in my laptop and started listen... best choice of my life. All the songs have a catchy beat, bring-you-up lyrics (see Smile Like You Mean It) and best of all, it doesn't plague in the CD loudness wars--meaning that it isn't clipped or distorted to increase the volume, resulting in bad sound quality. Definitely import this album to FLAC.     Songs: 5/5  Sound Quality: 5/5  Album Artwork: 5/5      BUY THIS.
B002HNA95E|3.0|Unfortunately, I have to agree with the hardcore fans, like me, on this one: THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER. I can't say I wasted my money because I got the 2 cd's and the dvd free with an amazon gift code, but, the point is: I feel like I bought a collection that repeats on the same songs I already have on my existent collection, and while I am not proficient at understanding the differences pointed out by others, such as, different versions and musical components of the songs, is like having more of the same.  On the positive side, the sound is excellent, and I love to listen to it since a hardcore fan never gets tired of Madonna's music, but because I am hardcore as to pay $500 for her concert tickets, and being in front of the catwalk as I was during her last tour (after six attempts since Drowned World, and including, Reinvention, Confessions and of course Sticky and Sweet) watching Madonna life right in front of my face, doesn't mean I will give it 5 stars.  One have to be objective, and I am sorry but, unless your new into Madonna or you are a mild fan, it is hardly worth to purchase this collection, though, they did a nice job with the little poster which I am going to frame and hang on my bedroom wall.  Oh, and I agree too with those who thought that REVOLVER sounds like a Britney Spears anthem, that was the first thing I thought too when listening to it the first 10 seconds.  Despite the disappointment, I do not regret having it. ABSOLUTELY NOT REGRETS (is Human Nature!).
0385504225|1.0|Amateurish.  Stupid mistakes and assumptions.  All aspects of the CIA security director are laughable.  The story is so disjointed and ill-conceived that I simply stopped reading the book less than half way through...
0385341008|5.0|This book was a true joy to read. I found it hard to put down as I grew to care so much about each of these characters and their lives. The format is entirely told through letters between many different characters living in the Channel Islands during the German occupation in WW II and whom form a makeshift book club of sorts. Its heartbreaking that the author passed away before the book was published and didn't get to see how many have loved her book. It deserved its #1 place on the NY Times bestseller list. My recommendation: save it for a trip as there is nothing worse than being in the nmiddle of a book on a plane or train and realizing you are bored and don't care about the characters you are reading about. That won't happen with this one!
0618526412|4.0|Carson McCullers' \\"Ballad of the Sad Cafe\\" and \\"Member of the Wedding\\" are among my favorite stories ever, and I also like Flannery O'Connor's \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" which I think qualifies me to declare myself a bona fide fan of Southern Gothic. (I also admired \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" which has elements of the genre.) However, I just couldn't love \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.\\" It seems to me to occupy an uncomfortable middle ground between the grotesque, stylized story telling of \\"Ballad of the Sad Cafe\\" and the heartbreaking, naturalistic interactions between the characters of \\"Member of the Wedding.\\" There are only traces of the distinctive humor that appears in the later stories. To me, it feels like McCullers is just warming up.    Still, it is fascinating to see her introduction of the themes that played a role in her later works: the lover's disregard for the true nature of the beloved, the would-be reformer's lack of understanding of the true nature of society, the child's self-absorption and vulnerability. I do recommend the book, but primarily to those who have already read her other books, or will go on to do so.
0385504225|1.0|I wanted to like this book. Of Dan Brown's books my favorite is Angels and Demons. Lost Symbol lacks suspense. As others did, I figured out bad guy early on or so called major twist.<br />No surprises but lots of long explanations . The funniest part to me was after being kidnapped up all night etc-Peter \\"Solomon\\" (really- how obvious with the name ) has the energy to go all around DC and show Langdon where the Lost Word is???. Book is just plain silly with not enough character buildup or any payoff at all. Skip it.
B001FB4VXU|4.0|It is very comfortable to buy this new relase from home even it is at the same price as the store , but in my case I live abroad and can have the series I like just after they release. GOOD BUY
B00013RC66|5.0|Yes I love the movie that much. It is a great movie buy it as soon as possible. Or rent it from the library/Red Box and then buy it when you can't get enough.
0385504225|4.0|I like Dan Brown books.  Unlike  most readers, DaVinci code was not my favorite.  This book was good- at times there was a little too much detail.  I agree with others that about 100 pages could have been cut out.  BUT, it's a good book and better than about 90% of everything else in the library.  I WAS able to guess all the surprises, which I've never done in his books before....but that was okay.  It's a good book.  Don't buy it new unless that's your thing.  Buy a used copy, or get it from the library and don't go thinking it's going to be bigger, better and amazing.  Just looking for a good book?  Okay, you found one.
B002KVSJ7S|4.0|I'll get straight to the point - this album is more mature, and slower than Mika's first album.  It's also not as good, but Mika's debut album was always going to be a tough thing to live up to.    The strongest songs are good gone girl, we are golden, by the time and Dr John.  My personal favourite tracks are split by 2 of these songs - by the time and we are golden.  Blue eyes, rain, touches you, one foot boy, toy boy are also quite good.  Sorry, but newer songs like pick it up off the floor, I see you and blame it on the girls don't really do much for me.      I feel that on this album, Mika's production team have focused to much on the music, and not enough on Mika's fabulous voice, in direct contrast to the first album.      For those expecting a sound similar to his first album - be warned, the closest you'll get is good gone girls and we are golden.  The rest of the album is much slower.  And ignore the hype about the video for we are golden - it's a fabulous video - colourful and fun to watch.    I gave this album 4 stars because it does grown on you over time and it's not a bad album.
B0002OXVDW|4.0|I am glad I was able to purchase this set.<br /><br />Each of the three original feature movies is on a two sided DVD, with standard and widescreen sides, an option I really appreciate. The quality was excellent. Yes, I see that someone commented on sudden color changes, but either that copy was somehow damaged in manufacture or the reviewer's DVD player wasn't \\"happy\\" with the DVD. I've seen DVDs play better on one machine than on another... I've heard records do the same. Anytime something is being read by spinning it past the object that reads it (needle; laser; whatever), there can be differences in how the disc is read. I find this happens with DVDs that have subtitles and/or language choices more than with those that read the same every time, and these do have 3 language choices for subtitles. The only \\"color changes\\" are the switching from B&W movies to color ones when I view them.<br /><br />Perhaps the most special moment is when Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire dance together while \\"hosting\\" Part 2. Both had mentioned how special it was to dance together briefly that one time before. It was so very special to see them dance together one more time, to see those great dancers side by side, and seeing the enjoyment and mutual respect.<br /><br />Dances/scenes are rarely shown in their entirety due to time constraints, but most are excellent montage types or are edited so well that it takes a moment to realize that verse 2 or the bridge was cut. Thankfully, the entire \\"Singin' in the Rain\\" by Gene Kelly is in the 1st one. Part 2 also has come comedians, and another scene shown in its entirety is the Groucho Marx and his steamer trunk in the tiny ship cabin.
B002KLAL4W|4.0|\\"Just Breathe\\" is one of the best PJ songs ever! The first 5 tracks stand out on the album. Nothing special about the last six songs, but I still like them. Album don't last long enough. If you don't get the album at least download \\"Just Breathe\\". I like the fact that Pearl Jam is trying new sounds.

B001AVCFJM|1.0|Awful. Shiny, colorful, loud, and awful.  I like science fiction, I'm not a science fiction fanatic, I like Star Trek, I'm not a Star Trek fanatic. I wanted this movie to be good, it is not good. I went twice to make sure I wasn't in a bad mood. Hated it more. The characters are obnoxious, the plot is moronic and unoriginal, the camera work is claustrophobic, the production design... I won't go on. The fans want Star Trek to live, and I sympathize, but it doesn't deserve to live like this. Let it die.
B000784WMW|5.0|I saw this excellent miniseries a little more than a year ago, and I have to say, it is a superb production of the classic love story. Timothy Dalton, a classically trained Shakesperean actor, brings to this role everything he would later take to James Bond: smoldering sexuality, repressed torment and flaming desire, topped off with cold civility. I was only disappointed in Zelah Clarke, who (to me) looked too old to play Jane, but she did a splendid job. The scenes with Sinjun Rivers towards the end initially bored me, but they were essential to the story. Very faithful to the source material. I highly recommend this miniseries. For fans of period pieces, Timothy Dalton and wonderful literature, you will not be disappointed. Not Rated. Skip the 1997 miniseries by A&E. BUY this one, and rent the 1996 film by Zefirelli.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is the film that put Disney on the map when it came to animated movies. In fact, many people consider it the film that changed the way animation was shown in theaters. It was the first film that Walt Disney produced; it was the first full-length cell-animated feature, as well as being the first animated film shown in American theaters, It was also the first produced in color and the first to be considered a Walt Disney classic.         The story is based on a much darker tale written in Germany by the Brothers Grimm.  Walt Disney, however, turned the idea into the fairy tale story that it is today and added certain elements to detail that were not included in the Brothers Grimm story.  The story Disney tells is one of a princess named Snow White whose wicked stepmother, the Queen, has dressed her in servants' clothes and put her to work cleaning the castle. One day, when the Queen's Magic Mirror tells the Queen that she is no longer the fairest in the land, the Queen asks a hunter to take Snow White into the forest, kill her, and bring her heart back to the Queen. However, instead of doing as the queen requests, the hunter tells Snow White to run into the forest and to \\"never come back.\\" He then brings the heart of a pig to the Queen to cover his tracks. However, the Magic Mirror tells the Queen that Snow White is still alive and living in the forest with the seven dwarfs. The Queen then descends into her dungeon where she practices black magic and turns herself into an old crone.  She also makes a poison apple, which she plans to give to Snow White. This apple will make Snow White sleep forever, and only the kiss of a price can reverse the curse.        It has been decades since I last watched Snow White as a child. I vaguely remember catching pieces of the film here and there on VHS while my sisters stared at the television being sucked into the film's imaginary world. It is not until no, that I realize what a great animated film Snow White really is.  For a film that was produced in 1937, you would expect there to be an issue with the overall quality of the film on Blu-ray. While it still has the classical animated look to its characters, on Blu-ray, Snow White becomes a film like no other.       With the Diamond edition Blu-ray combo pack Disney, does the fans right.  The film not only comes on a Blu-ray Disc, but a DVD as well.  I do not know how Disney did it, but the 1080p High Definition/1.33:1 transfer looks flawless. The restoration is unbelievable.  All the details of the film come to life, the picture quality is so crisp, and clear, you almost feel as if you are experiencing the film for the first time.        The three-disc Diamond Edition has  a ton of special features. The DVD disc comes with the full-length version of the film with an all new digital restoration with enhanced picture and sound as well as the original and restored theatrical soundtrack. There is also audio commentary with animator John Canemaker. It also includes a music video and a sneak peak at the new Disney animated film The Princess and the Frog.       The Blu-ray Disc features come on two separate discs. The first disc has the film in its newly transferred version in HD 7.1 Sound and all. There are also Music video and a Disneyview, which is an expanded experience where you can see things about the film that you never have before.  The features are divided into three categories on the disc. The first is the \\"Disney Family Play\\" which includes three games such as \\"What did you see,\\" a scrambled image in which you have to decipher and guess what you are seeing. \\"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall,\\" where the mirror will determine which Disney Princess you are most like. There is also a matching game called Jewel Jumble. The Backstage Disney features include a slew of things, which include three featurettes, and a sneak peak at the new Disney princess animated film, The Princess and the Frog. The first featurette,Snow White Returns, shows newly-discovered storyboards that suggest that Walt Disney planned a sequel for Snow White. There is also a featurette titled Hyperion Studios which gives a tour of Disney's original studio and the featurette The One that Started it All, where we learn how the film launched the Disney name in movies and how, as a film, Snow White changed the movie-going experience and paved the way for feature-length animated films. There are also the classic bonus features that include the game Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, \\"Heigh-Ho\\" a karaoke sing along and a Disney though the Decades feature and more.       While this disc is sure to become a big-seller for the Christmas season, I do want to warn parents that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs does have a few things that might scare some younger viewers. This includes such scenes as when the hunter is about to stab Snow White, but instead tells her to run into the forest. When she runs into the forest, all the trees and plants around her turn into monsters and seem to be are after her. There is also the wicked Queen who is into black magic and turns herself into the hideous witch with the poison apples.  I think Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is best suited for children over the age of five or six. As a parent, you must judge if you think some of these scenes are too scary for your young ones. My two-year-old daughter laughed at the scenes, but for some more sensitive kids, this might be an issue.     When you think Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you think Disney. On Blu-ray disc this film looks phenomenal. It is probably the best-produced Blu-ray disc I have had the pleasure of reviewing. No one does it like Disney, and that is the truth.  The disc is truly a must-have for all fans of not only Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, but for fans of the entire Disney brand.
1416594787|5.0|I have read every book Richard Dawkins has written, except [[ASIN:061861916X The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution]]. I started reading that and stopped at page 86, because it was the last book of his that I hadn't read and it was not clear that he would write another. You see, I started backwards, so to speak. I first read [[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]] because of it's status on the best seller list, the nattering on the cable news networks, and the absolute disbelief that any educated person on the planet could actually believe our earth was only a few thousand years old. Next book was [[ASIN:0199291152 The Selfish Gene: 30th Anniversary Edition--with a new Introduction by the Author]] (thank you RD for the glossary) followed by [[ASIN:0192880519 The Extended Phenotype: The Long Reach of the Gene (Popular Science)]]. Long story short, after that I bought [[ASIN:0716776715 Life: The Science of Biology]], started to really study, and consumed more books on the subject.<br /><br />Not just the \\"theorum\\" of Evolution (what an appropriate new meme) and the concept of \\"history-denial\\" as an alternative adjectival to the tiresome \\"creationism\\" drew me to Dawkins' new book. In fact, I wasn't quite sure I would like this new book after reading the first chapter (\\"Only a Theory\\") where he introduces the new terms. Yet, having read Dawkins, I continued to read because he has his own way of sucking one into the story, so to speak.<br /><br />If Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:0670020532 Why Evolution Is True]] is a strong theme in the symphony of explaining why evolution is true, as is Donald Prothero's[[ASIN:0231139624 Evolution: What the Fossils Say and Why It Matters]], Sean Carroll's [[ASIN:0393330516 The Making of the Fittest: DNA and the Ultimate Forensic Record of Evolution]], Neil Shubin's [[ASIN:0307277453 Your Inner Fish: A Journey into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body (Vintage)]] (the delightful Carl Zimmer's [[ASIN:0307276864 Microcosm: E. Coli and the New Science of Life (Vintage)]]) and many others, then this latest book by Dawkins is a subtle melody (and a sledgehammer) that weaves its way around the works of others, and becomes a catalyst for an inescapable crescendo.<br /><br />For example, take Chapter 4 \\"Silence and slow time\\". Sure, there are dating methods, from tree rings to radioactive isotopes but who would know how the various methods were developed and intertwined unless one studied this stuff?<br /><br />Oh yes, this book is \\"another\\" Dawkins book in that the reader is drawn in, perhaps reluctantly, exposed to the works of others, taunted into learning more, experiences amazing examples of how to look at something from a different perspective, and never *ever* feels like they are being denigrated because they are not a scientist.

B0024RID60|4.0|Hey, in 2009 no one, including this reviewer, NEEDS to comment on the fact that The Rolling Stones, pound for pound, have over forty plus years earned their place as the number one band in the rock `n' roll pantheon. Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from the tale end of their most creative period , moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the `golden era\\" of the Stone Age. While this CD has a fistful of \\"greatest hits\\" from this period some of the songs are distinctly anti-women, intentionally or not, at least the lyrics would not then, and do not today, stand the test for \\"political correctness\\". That includes \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"Beast Of Burden\\" ( a little). Nevertheless this stuff holds up pretty well, especially \\"The Girl With Far Away Eye\\".
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown is a great writer so it disappointed me to see him use the exact format from the Da Vinci Code for this book.  It was interesting to see him place it in our nations capitol and use the free masons as his secret society, however everything else was a copy of his block buster.  If you are looking for something new don't waste your money on this book. Read one of his other books such as Angels and Demons or Digital Fortress. Otherwise get it from your local library.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Monty Python and the Holy Grail Special Edition is a wonderfully product the entire family can enjoy.

Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is Disney's latest film to have received a remastering treatment and is being released as a diamond edition. I could not imagine anything less for Disney's first feature length animated film. I have the 3 disc combo pack which includes the dvd of the film (for those who do not have a blu ray player  like me), disc 2 is the blu-ray version, and disc three is chock full of bonus footage which will really please the younger viewers.<br /><br />I admit I have forgotten when the last time I actually had watched Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I am more the positive that the last time I saw it was when I was still a little girl. The story of Snow White hiding from her wicked stepmother and living among seven dwarfs is timeless. Even at 35, I am still entertained by the story. The animation is beautiful and vibrant, especially the apple. The sound quality is just as good. I definitely recommend buying the diamond edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I don't think you are too old to watch this timeless classic.

0385504225|2.0|I really enjoyed Angels and the DeVinci Code but this effort just does not do it.  I am not the most astute reader of action books so when I can figure it out early on it is not a strong endorsement.  I could not figure what drove the people and there was not any conflict.  Dan Brown had a point that he spent the last 50 pages explaining. He obviously believes that he has a pulpit and will use it.  That is not why I read a thriller so all in all I did not enjoy this.
0316017922|4.0|Why are so many professional hockey players born in January or February? Why are so many millionaires born in certain decades?  Why do the co-pilots on so many plane crashes come from similar cultural backgrounds?  And what the heck does a rice paddy have to do with success in math?<br /><br />Odd questions like these lead to interesting chapters in Malcolm Gladwell's OUTLIERS, a book whose thesis contends that success isn't a product of chance or genes so much as circumstances and hard work.  For the rest of us grunts, that's good news of a sort, but from a reading standpoint, it's just plain entertaining news.  Gladwell has a nose for statistics and trends, and even tackles such sacred cows as so-called \\"geniuses\\" by proving that having a heady IQ does NOT make the man unless the man knows how to deal with other people (and many geniuses do not).<br /><br />Want to be good at something?  Gladwell shows that there's a \\"10,000-Hour Rule\\" in play.  Practice, practice, practice (for 10,000 hours) and you can be good at most anything.  Want your child to succeed in school?  Find one that's like the KIPP schools, goes until 5 p.m. every day and is in session for half a day each Saturday and most of July as well.  And about those plane crashes: Did you know that most of them take not one, not two, not three, but perhaps half a dozen series of \\"little mistakes\\" to occur?  A tired pilot, bad weather, and a behind-schedule flight are the foundation of many crashes -- but who would've thunk a co-pilot from Columbia, Korea, or Belgium (among other countries) might be the reason?  Gladwell shows us that the cultural upbringing of co-pilots who defer to pilots and are unable to assert themselves verbally when they sense danger has proven a key reason for many crashes.  He rolls the tape on more than one black-box final moment to show exactly what he means.<br /><br />Overall?  Entertaining stuff.  Jumping around topically, the book will obviously be more compelling in some chapters than others depending on the make-up and interests of individual readers, but overall, this is what good non-fiction does.  It conveys factual material in an entertaining way; it backs up arguments with logical facts, statistics, and anecdotes.  And, writing-wise, it steals from the fiction writers' bag of tricks to flow in a manner that has you flipping pages without even knowing it.ng on the make-up and interests of individual readers, but overall, this is what good non-fiction does.

But then I came to the most incredible piece of information in the book.  The Redskins..in a playoff game... COME ON, you can't get away with that nonsense.  What a ridiculous premise.  How much does Brown think we can believe?  There has to be at least a little bit of realism in the book, and this really blew it for me.  LOL

Reacher is an ex-MP who wanders the country, much like David Carradine's character in the TV show \\"Kung Fu\\", carrying few belongings and saving the day. In this book Reacher becomes involved in the kidnapping of an ex-Army officer's wife and daughter and then goes gumshoe detective encountering twists, turns and bad guys along the way - An oft-repeated plot but still an engaging book and one of the better entries in this series.
1591391105|1.0|This is a formulaic manual for what to do if you get a management type position.  Basically, do this, then this, ect.  It is extremely dry.  I thought it might be of benefit to me even though I already have been in my job almost two years.  Wrong.  This is a book to read before you start a new management position.  It is for corporate management settings, and maybe industrial management, but certainly not retail management.  I thought it did have some very good suggestions about interviewing those around you, above, besides and below you, in order to make the greatest impact.  In fact, after reading it, I am fairly certain my new boss read it because he pretty much followed the formula to a tee.  For most people this book is not going to be relevant, but for the upper echelons of the corporate world, it is likely worthwhile for them to read.
B001S86J0I|4.0|I thought Galaxy Quest was funny, smart and beautifully acted the first time I saw it, and it holds up after repeated viewings.  The writing is first-class, essential for any good film.  But the talented cast - Alan Rickman, Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver, Tony Shalhoub, Sam Rockwell and surprise standout, Enrico Colantoni as the lead Thermian - wring every laugh and, yes, every poignant moment out of the script and its unlikely situations.  All Star Trek fans should love it for its knowing and affectionate spoof of the shows and sci-fi conventions.  But lovers of good writing, fine acting and comedy in general should enjoy this movie too.    The extras are a treat, lots of interviews revealing interesting tidbits, like the way Enrico Colantoni developed the Thermian way of speaking and moving which was then taken up by the other actors playing the aliens.  It was funny to learn too that Sigourney Weaver had to fight to get her part because the filmmakers didn't want anyone who had actually done sci-fi!  As she says, who better to spoof the genre than someone who's been there and done that?  (She's the one whose character has \\"one dumb job\\" to do in the TV show the Thermians think is a documentary).      This film, and particularly the deluxe edition DVD, are highly recommended for a good time.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I love Breaking Benjamin. Especially after their old drummer ditched (he was boring as hell to listen to)  This album offers eleven tracks, and within each is a very good mix of all their past work.  While nowhere near as many memorable tracks as past offerings, this album solidifies the band as a major force in modern rock.  Ben has matured so much in his vocal delivery and the band has mended into a wonderful ensemble.  This CD is a much needed break from the constant upkeep in delivering cliche' rock, and I gladly recommend it to any fans of hard rock in general. Love it.  Keep rockin BB!!

B002LVVCIK|4.0|Once again, Michael Moore tackles a tough subject and makes it understandable for the masses. This time, he's addressed the economic crisis in America and the battle between Wall Street and Main Street. While some may disagree with his flamboyant presentation, Moore takes dry subjects and adds interest and humanity. Is the film slanted, yes; however, in the places where Moore states factual numbers, those statements are verifiable. For example, the top 1% of the wealthiest have more assets than the other 99%.      Unfortunately, that top one percent wants to keep it that way and they have so far had the means to do so.  The key topic of this film is unrestrained capitalism resulting in unrestrained greed. As Machiavelli stated, \\"Absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\"     Some examples of capitalistic misuse of power:    Privatization for profit:  The concept of private versus public goods is detailed very well in the case of a juvenile detention center which was privatized in Wilkes Barre, PA. Taxpayers ended up spending $58M for the detention center.  Due to collusion between juvenile judges and the private owners of the center, youths had less than 5 minutes before the bench prior to sentencing for months in detention. Key to this is that neither a judge nor probation worker determined when the kids were to be released--that was left up to an employee of the center who answered to no one but their private sector boss.      \\"Dead Peasant\\" insurance:  In these instances, major employers take out life insurance policies on their employees to the extent that their 'human resources' are worth more to them dead than alive.     In addition to cases like these, Moore discusses the bailouts, unique work situations and how the people of Main Street are taking back their own power.      Moore states his case for the people Main Street in a cogent, compassionate, and entertaining fashion.  The film is well worth seeing.       Rebecca Kyle, October 2009
B001C4CI8U|4.0|I was turned on to this show by someone in a news forum .They said the first couple discs were hohum but it got better.  They were absolutely correct.   Even better that it was released on blu ray.  The show really is much like the x-files only with more characters than just a mulder/scully duo. There are half a dozen primary characters who work together to solve gruesome cases of monsters etc .  The cases all lead back to the conspiracy arc .  The characters,especially Anna Torv's take maybe 8 or 9 eps to warm up but once they get it together the show really cooks.  Highly recommended.I'd give it 5 stars but for the slow start.
B000002L7Y|4.0|I wonder how much a-ha gives a damn that the U.S.A. only knows (or cares) about one song from their entire 25-year career? \\"Take On Me\\" cast a long shadow for them in this country, and they've never really gotten out from under it. Of course in the rest of the world they've been pretty consistent hitmakers, so maybe it's not that big a deal to them. This album contains that monstrous song, and it pretty much sets the template for the rest of the record: well-enunciated, pleading vocals, and romantic, dramatic, operatic synthesizers.<br /><br />The band puts those strengths to good use throughout this album. \\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\\" should have been a prom night standard for the decade, and \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\" almost pitches the band in Depeche Mode territory, with its multipart structure and the percolating drums that kick in partway through. The latter song was a hit for the group in the U.K., who always had a bit more patience for dance pop than us surly Americans, at least as far as the singles charts are concerned. The album's ballads are particularly well done also, such as the slow-burning title track and the winsome \\"And You Tell Me\\".<br /><br />Really there aren't many dead spots on the record overall, and each song is sufficiently different from the next that they never really repeat themselves. The problem is that no song really flies into the stratosphere except for \\"Take On Me\\", so if you're not paying attention tracks 2 through 10 can fade into the background. I'm not sure if that's because they're actually not as gripping as the first song, or if I've been programmed like everyone else to dismiss the rest of the group's output. Either way, if you're paying attention there's a lot to enjoy on this album, so I recommend giving it an hour of your time.

B000000W6X|2.0|It's a testament to the band's strengths that Massive Attack's worst album still works on any level at all. But compared to the albums immediately before and after it, it's nothing to write home about. Their first album BLUE LINES was a milestone in the world of trip hop, and it seems like the group wasn't sure how to follow it up. Unfortunately, they did the worst possible thing: they basically made the same album again, but not as well. If I ever make an album as great as BLUE LINES, I'll be tempted to copy myself too, but hopefully I'll do a better job than they did.<br /><br />Protection opens with a slow dramatic opener just like its predecessor, but \\"Protection\\" lacks the spare menace and singular production of \\"Safe From Harm\\", and Tracey Thorn is a much more conventional vocalist than the last album's Shara Nelson. The tiny \\"Payback\\" sample in the middle of the song's main riff is cute, but otherwise this song eases into background music mode too much to be effective, and the rest of the album follows in this vein. \\"Karmacoma\\" is one of the better tunes of the bunch, with great vocals by the soon-to-quit Tricky and a jumped-up dub beat. It's a poor cousin to BLUE LINES' \\"Five Man Army\\", but still not bad. The thing that really sinks this album is the instrumentals. \\"Weather Storm\\" and \\"Heat Miser\\" are completely inconsequential tracks that meander aimlessly and suck up eight minutes of the listener's attention for no good reason. The production on this album is overall much warmer and less abrasive than their previous work, so these instrumental bits really turn into Muzak. There's another minor triumph mid-album with \\"Better Things\\", one of the few instances on the record where both the vocals and the music are equally gripping. The live cover of \\"Light My Fire\\" at the end is just the final nail in the coffin; it's abrasive, but in the wrong way. It sounds like it was made by a completely different, and much crappier, reggae rock band. I'm getting pissed off just listening to it as I compose this review.<br /><br />Shortly after the release of this album, Massive Attack contracted the Mad Professor to remix it, and his version of the record, NO PROTECTION, is leagues better. After that, the band underwent a massive (ha!) reinvention, and played up their more monolithic side for the enormous-sounding MEZZANINE. So there are lots of really great Massive Attack albums you could buy before you need to consider getting this one.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|We received our discs and watched as a family over the weekend. I was a little dissapointed at first because it started out as one of those \\"old\\" cartoons that you cannot get kids interested in these days. However, as the movie played, my children, especially the youngest 3 (ages 2, 3 and 8) actually sat down and watched the movie in its entirety. In the words of my 2yr old \\"The turtle is funny.\\" They absolutely loved it. They even watched the extras at the end. We didn't have a chance to play with any of the other features yet but I bet they are just as awesome.    As a parent, I loved that it came with both dvd and blue ray. I gave the kids the dvd to take upstairs. Now they can watch it any time they want. It has quickly become a bedtime favorite. The price is well worth it especially when I can get the kids tucked in and calmed down by 9:00 pm. They are excited to get into their beds so we can turn on Snow White. The opportunity to share this classic tale with my children gave me a warm feeling inside. If your stuck for Christmas gift ideas, this is one gift that will be appreciated for years to come by kids and parents alike!
B000063DFS|2.0|How many good albums has Ozzy Osbourne really made as a solo artist? Four? Three? In 29 years? The man gets a lot of slack, first for being the original frontman of the greatest heavy metal band of all time, and lately for being a reality television star. But really, some of his albums are a little bit embarrassing, and this isn't one of the better ones. It was loudly applauded back in the 90's, when people were just happy he hadn't committed suicide or homicide, but looking back, there's not a lot on here to hold my attention.<br /><br />Incidentally, I went to see Ozzy touring for this album, on the now-humorously named No More Tours. I'd already owned the record for a few months, but the only songs that stuck out live for me were the Sabbath numbers and the selections from BLIZZARD OF OZZ and NO REST FOR THE WICKED. I jumped and cheered when he played \\"No More Tears\\" and \\"I Don't Want to Change the World\\", but I wasn't really that excited about them. This album is mostly Ozzy-by-numbers. The funky, then-contemporary sound of the title track aside, these songs stick closely to the garish pop metal that Ozzy had been trading in ever since THE ULTIMATE SIN, although they're helped quite a bit by the distinctive guitar work of Zakk Wylde, who (Randy Rhoads fans be damned) is truly the best guitarist Ozzy has ever worked with in his solo career. His heavy-but-nimble and instantly recognizable leads work wonders on even the most pedestrian material here. And sadly, there's a lot of pedestrian material here. There's clumsy \\"ooh look how controversial\\" numbers like \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\", songs where Ozzy drones on about what a crazy rock and roller he is (\\"Hellraiser\\"), and songs about nothing in particular (\\"Zombie Dance\\", \\"Road to Nowhere\\"). Ozzy himself has never claimed to be a great vocalist, but he has a very small number of vocal melodies he turns to, no matter what song he's singing, and he can be monotonous to listen to over the course of an album if steps aren't taken to work around his limited range, and unfortunately they don't do that here.<br /><br />So in the end, you have a little over an hour of typical Ozzy: mid-paced metal getting by on reputation, and salvaged somewhat by a fantastic lead guitarist. If you're an old-time Ozzy Osbourne fan, you've probably accepted these faults and think this album kicks ass and that I don't know what I'm talking about, but anyone trying this out somewhat objectively will hear what I mean within the first three tracks. Be warned. Even his new album (BLACK RAIN) is better than this.ork around his limited range, and unfortunately they don't do that here.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|Over the years there have been a few tv shows that I really loved: THE MAN FROM U.N.CL.E., KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER, THE X-FILES, BURN NOTICE, SUPERNATURAL and .... FRINGE. This is a terrific piece of imaginative entertainment.  It isn't the X-FILES but is the next step.  J.J. Abrams and company and taken the next step. (Maybe something Chris Carter CAN'T do.)  I am not going to give all kinds of spoilers -- I can't stand those people who detail every episode to the point where why should I bother?  No, if you love really envolving and complex stories with characters who you can care about, this is for you.  This a classic in the making!  All I can say is wow!  I write and I wish I had thought of a series like this!  Watch, be involved and enjoy!
B000002UY5|4.0|Blind Melon were one of the tougher bands to categorize during the Alternative Explosion of the early 1990's. Not because they work in an esoteric style; the band plays lightly psychedelic classic rock, and their music fits squarely into the jam band tradition. But if you wanted a new band to sell in those days, you had to market them as \\"alternative\\". So poor Blind Melon were forced to compete in the same field as L7 and Nirvana, and took a lot of criticism (\\"alternative to what?\\") for a description they had nothing to do with. Fortunately the band found their crowd organically, and mainstream rock fans who dug Led Zeppelin and the Black Crowes found their way over to Blind Melon eventually.<br /><br />Listening to the album now, Blind Melon's self-titled debut is a remarkable straightforward heavy rock album, filled with inventive riffs and melodies, dusted with psychedelic leanings and occasional country sensibilities, and blessed with an expressive singer. Furthermore, it's almost completely free from 90's production techniques, so it's aged a lot better than other albums from the era (like Pearl Jam's debut TEN, which sounds rather slick in comparison). The album is loaded with ambitious yet low-key compositions, like the soaring opener \\"Soak the Sin\\" the very Led Zeppelin-esque \\"I Wonder\\", which swings from a delicately-picked intro to an uptempo solo-driven middle section and back, and of course the hippie-ish jam hit single \\"No Rain\\". Singer Shannon Hoon lacks the rampant ego that makes so many blue-eyed soul crooners so hard to stomach, and I've never understood why he takes as much criticism as he does. The band is equally unpretentious, and their hardest-rocking numbers here, like the slightly Jane's Addiction-leaning \\"Tones of Home\\" and the funky \\"Seed to a Tree\\", just sound like great ways to get a crowd going at their show.<br /><br />As I said, Blind Melon were ultimately embraced by the classic rock-loving crowd, which meant that the jocks in high school totally dug them, and cranky elitist hipsters like me tended to fault the band for their fanbase. But listen to Blind Melon with an open mind, and the band's good nature shines through on every song, and makes it impossible to dislike them. The sound of this album has since been resurrected by an entire new generation of bands picking out the best bits of rhythm and blues and folk and reinventing them (As Tall As Lions, Mewithoutyou, The New Pornographers, etc.). So now more than ever, it's worth giving Blind Melon a listen. It doesn't have a great rep, and the album cover is ugly (sorry kid, I know everyone is pretty in their own way, but that's a damn unflattering shot of you), but the music contained in it is totally worthwhile.g them, and cranky elitist hipsters like me tended to fault the band for their fanbase.

0545123267|5.0|I love wolves to begin with and this story was just beautiful to me, probably partly for that reason.  I found the technique of going back and forth between his thoughts and hers very different and it worked well to give a feeling of how everything was working.  It was a haunting feel good story, a different take entirely on werewolves or shapeshifters than I have read before.  The ending was so beautiful it made me cry.  I have only my very favorite hardcover books displayed in my living room and I added this one. It is an easy read, I am not a young adult but like feeling like one.
B000002KZ6|5.0|This is the first album I ever purchased. It would have been a Weird Al Yankovic album (DARE TO BE STUPID, specifically) if not for seeing the movie Revenge of the Nerds as a child, and hearing \\"Burning Down the House\\" played in the frat party scene near the beginning. I just thought it was a cool robotic-sounding song, and had no idea that the rest of the album would blow my 10-year-old mind the way it did.<br /><br />It's often been my experience that the first thing you hear from a band strongly affects how you judge the rest of their work, so if you dive into the middle of their discography the earlier albums simply sound like precursors and the later albums sound like deviations. That's exactly how Speaking in Tongues has affected Talking Heads for me. Of course in this instance, it helps that this is truly the best album the group ever put out. Expanding their sound massively by adding backup singers and extra orchestration, the group stretched out their original nervous, jittery sound into a spacious, rhythmic, eccentric groove, full of unexpected percussive and lyrical asides, eerie melodies and inexplicable drama that catches you up even if you don't understand it. David Byrne's lyrics are in high obtuse mode here, and while I imagine he's making sense to himself (despite his chant of \\"stop making sense!\\" at the end of the song \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\"), he seems to be basically painting with words from our perspective. But it's a lovely painting.<br /><br />It's difficult for me to be objective about this record because I've been listening to it for 22 years, but there are so many high points on it: obviously the bombastic \\"Burning Down the House\\", but also the careening \\"Making Flippy Floppy\\" and \\"Pull Up the Roots\\" (the latter riding a piano line with almost unbearable tension), \\"Girlfriend Is Better\\", which sounds like Parliament on downers, and the spare, abstract pieces \\"Slippery People\\" (with a pronounced gospel influence) and \\"I Get Wild/Wild Gravity\\". There's more great songs, but I don't want to spoil all the surprises for you. I've bought lots of Talking Heads records since this point, but their early work ('77, FEAR OF MUSIC) lacks the nuance of this album, and on subsequent records (TRUE STORIES, NAKED) the insistent groove seems to fade away, like they couldn't concentrate long enough to maintain it.

B001UN1KVE|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies and of course a classic Mel Brooks film. I own this on DVD, but definitely wanted it on Blu-Ray as well. For a movie of its age, it looks great on Blu-Ray. I had fun watching it all over again in high-def! The sound is truly better. That's probably the biggest improvement. It does have extra features too, which is always nice, although my main concern is the film itself.<br /><br />Overall a great buy for any Mel Brooks fan!
B000A78Z82|4.0|Cripple Crow comes as quite a shock to those of us who were fans of Devendra Banhart's first couple of albums for Michael Gira's Young God Records. His early style was stark and strangely old-timey, like they were recently unearthed gems from the early 20th century. Conversely, this new album is warm and organic, and steeped in a large assortment of different sounds and styles, including various kinds of folk, both American and that of his native Venezuela, several decades of rock, stripped-down blues, and more. Compared to his early albums, Cripple Crow is like that moment in The Wizard of Oz where the screen explodes into color.<br /><br />Folk music is the bedrock on which the album sits, and some of Banhart's finest folk compositions are here. The Spanish language pieces, like \\"Santa Maria de Feira\\" and \\"Quedateluna\\" are highlights, but equally gripping are English tracks like the melancholy singalong \\"Heard Somebody Say\\", and the more contemporary-sounding \\"Koreandogwood\\". Even the rockier songs on the album share the spare production and feel of the folk numbers. \\"Long Haired Child\\", with its blistering guitar fills and stomping beat, would have been produced as a storming heavy metal tune on anyone else's album, but Devendra Banhart allows the performance to up the energy level without hiding behind distortion. The same goes for the bopping beat on \\"Little Boys\\" and the gently sawing strings of \\"I Love That Man\\". Every style covered on the record gets filtered through the same folky, spare vibe, and the overall feel is of having a dream about being at a particularly energetic folk show. Presumably somewhere in South America. At 23 songs the album is long, but it never drags. Banhart is able to find infinite variation in his sound, and he makes each song feel like a necessary step in the journey.<br /><br />I don't know what the Spanish songs are about, but as far as the English tracks go, there are a number of war protest pieces, which is admirable, but there's also an odd number of tracks about Banhart's fascination with little boys, which is a little troubling. Still, other alleged pedophiles have had very nice careers in pop music, so I won't make an issue of it. For now, it's enough to say that Cripple Crow is a very nice album tightly packed with a lot of really good songs, and you'd be well advised to give it a listen.number of tracks about Banhart's fascination with little boys, which is a little troubling.

Like the rest of their work, Blackwater Park is an absolutely amazing moment in Swedish death metal history. It might not be their very best album (that award goes, at present, to 2005's GHOST REVERIES), but it was certainly their best album at the time it was released, and in fact can be considered the first album made by the group in the midst of their popular hype. Thankfully, Opeth lived up to it.<br /><br />Normally I spend the middle of these reviews mentioning specific songs on a record, the very best or very worst points on the album, etc. That's a tough thing to do with this album, because the songs (described as \\"movements\\" by the band) really do play as one continuous piece. Not in the sense that the album is one-dimensional or monotonous, because it's the exact opposite: each song is filled with so many different changes and sections that it takes a careful listener to discern the running theme (either lyrical or melodic) to each one, and picking out a favorite might be difficult. Regardless, there are lots of attractive passages, like the pretty Middle Eastern melody that runs through most of \\"Bleak\\", and the slow crawl from gently-strummed acoustic guitar up to stately death metal and back down to acoustics in \\"The Drapery Falls\\". Every song has a multitude of twists and turns that keep the piece interesting without sounding overly busy, a testament to the compositional skills of Mikael Åkerfeldt, no doubt aided by the guidance of first-time Opeth producer Steve Wilson (from Porcupine Tree).<br /><br />The band overall plays incredibly fluidly, moving from passage to passage, from fierce Swedish death metal tones to hushed folk melodies, delicately picked acoustics, washes of noise, and back with confidence and drama. Truly if anyone outside the death metal world needs evidence of the genre's artistic possibilities, Opeth is the band to turn to, and Blackwater Park is one of their finest examples. Highly recommended.rk is one of their finest examples. Highly recommended.
0743297334|1.0|I thought the following review, written for On The Road, was exactly the way I felt and did not want anyone to miss reading it. Call me lazy but.. (all credit to uofm84 for writing it too) Enjoy...<br /><br />1.0 out of 5 stars a little story, May 5, 2004<br />By \\"uofm84\\"<br />There once was an emperor who ruled over a great kingdom. One day, two tailors/book salesmen came to visit him. They told him about this glorious new novella \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" by Hemingway. They told him it was a barometer test for whether or not a person was intelligent. Anyone who liked Sun Also Rises was a genius, and anyone who disliked it a buffoon. Eager to prove how smart he was, the emperor quickly read the novella. When he was finished, he realized he was an idiot. Rather than being brilliant, he found the book to be a collection of insane ramblings and occurances that could only be interesting to Hemingway himself. It was about a man on a search for truth and meaning in the world, but he went about this by getting drunk and pretending that he liked poor people. However, when he saw true poor people in Spain, he thought about how terrible it would be to be them. This made no sense. The philosophy for a better life was more vapid and meaningless than the life before. Rather than changing the emperor's life, it made him long to have 4 hours of his life back. However, he was afraid to look like an idiot, and told the salesmen that it was the best book he had ever read. They were delighted, and told him he qualified for a special fabric...one that was invisible to everyone except those who loved \\"Sun Also Rises\\". The emperor couldn't see the fabric, but eagerly bought it. He then arranged for a public reading of \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", and told the townspeople how only intelligent people liked the novella. The people all lined up to hear the reading. They thought the book was nonsense, but were afraid to say so. They pretended that the work was life-altering, and that their ruler was actually clothed. Finally, a brave little boy in a tree shouted \\"This makes no sense.  Lets go to Spain and watch the brave bullfighters or we can read about all the bull*** in The Sun Also Rises.  Basically, Sun Also Rises and On The Road follow the same formula--travelling around and getting drunk, albeit with Sun Also Rises they did it with a little more class.  At least the main characters werent stealing in Sun Also Rises.as actually clothed. Finally, a brave little boy in a tree shouted \\"This makes no sense.

B00000IGGA|4.0|This is Tom Waits' poppiest album to date. Certainly his early albums have more of a mainstream appeal, but this is his first album (at least since his noisy makeover with 1983's SWORDFISHTROMBONES) where the focus is primarily on concise song structure, and not an overarching theme or pure sound. As such, even though it contains the same amount of crazed ranting and backwoods blues as regular Waits albums, it's the easiest listening that the man has offered up since he used to confine himself to barroom piano ballads.<br /><br />In a way, Mule Variations feels like The Best Of Tom Waits, as the songs touch on just about every phase of his career. \\"Big in Japan\\" opens the disc with a noisy but lively BONE MACHINE-style rhythm, followed the close-mic'd, percussion-heavy sound of SWORDFISHTROMBONES with \\"Lowside of the Road\\", then by classic sentimental Waits on \\"Hold On\\". The slick \\"Get Behind the Mule\\" could be a holdover from FRANKS WILD YEARS or RAIN DOGS, and the sparse \\"House Where Nobody Lives\\" takes us back to Waits' very first album. I could play this game all day, but it would make for a dull review, and I don't want to suggest that these songs are mere rehashes of work he's already done. \\"Cold Water\\" is an exuberant backwoods shuffle that lights up the first half of the album, and \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" is a more subdued minimalist blues piece that similarly is the highpoint of the album's second half. In fact, just about every song here is a winner, but since they don't have any overarching theme or consistent sound, you might not notice their charms at first. Mule Variations is definitely an album that needs to sit in your collection for a while to make all its attractions apparent.<br /><br />This is the first record that Waits recorded for the independent label Anti, and it seems like it was either a palette-cleanser or a consolidation of his skills, because it's a far cry from the densely unified records that preceded it (BONE MACHINE and THE BLACK RIDER) and the ambitious albums that followed it (ALICE and BLOOD MONEY). Despite seeming like a very laid back guy, there aren't many moments on record when Tom Waits just kicks back and belts out a few good songs in no particular order, so this album is a rare opportunity to hear him at what appears to be his most casual. It's nice to know that he still strikes gold, even when he's not reaching for the stars.albums that followed it (ALICE and BLOOD MONEY).

0156030306|5.0|I was quite touched by this book.  When Charly goes back home, you can't help but identify with it.  You think back to your own family experiences returning home and it gets to you.  The potential for bettering one's self is also inspiring.  The plot, character development, and turn of events all make for one page-turner of a novel.  Especially enjoyed the romantic episodes.  The ending...the ending...so sad.
031237593X|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite books, I had the original from many years ago and had re-read it at least a dozen times, but I loaned someone my copy and never got it back.  I had to re-order to be able to re-read it.  Its well written and totally enjoyable.  Historical based though it is fiction, its a great read and I recommend it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|In [[ASIN:B000V1Y44G Pixar Short Films Collection - Volume 1]], John Lassetter said that he knew he'd got it when he was asked after the first showing of  Luxo Jr at (I think it was) SIGGRAPH if the parent lamp was a mother or a father. People final saw past the pixels and saw the story and the characters instead.    Well if that is the gold standard, then Pixar has not only struck gold with Up but it has found diamonds on the side.    The story is a moving combination of humour and sadness, a tale of courage and dedication. Told with elegance and intelligence and filled with some hilarious story-lines and effects. The characterization is superb. Ed Asner captures the spirit of crotchety and lovable Carl Fredricksen, while Jordan Nagai keeps pace and acts as a charming and determined Russell. I won't say too much more about the other characters but hats off to them too.    I was taken in in the first five minutes and amazed by Pete Docter and Bob Petersen's sensitive and smart story telling. Their ability is most telling in those scenes where there is no dialogue at all and they put their trust in the cinematography - and this faith is rewarded. I think these are some of the movie's best scenes.    Thanks Pixar for sharing! I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I laughed again and again, and I left the movie, well, UPlifted.    Squirrel!
B00009XITP|5.0|I love this movie, it is so sweet!!! Amanda Bynes is so funny in this movie.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I admit I was hooked the moment I saw the shorts. It sounded like this was going to be a punchy, different re-telling. I had some 'concerns' about the change in tack and some worries in light of the interesting Star Trek: Enterprise series.     I am an occasional Trekkie - I used to sit in darkened rooms on sunny days watching taped US recordings (this was when I lived in NZ many years ago) - hard to describe the excitement of seeing DS 9 pilot episode months ahead of other Kiwis.    This movie an exciting take on the whole Star Trek franchise. JJ Abrams pays his respects to the original, but thankfully does not allow himself to be fettered by the original and has the vision to take a few daring steps and re-interpretations. Some of them are a bit confronting but in my opinion - as Spock might say: \\"Intriguing\\".    Die hard Trekkies (zealots?) may cry foul but I thought this was a great movie, super soundtracks, wonderful characterisations - Pine, Quinto put a new spring in the step of the James T Kirk and Mr Spock.     Get it, watch it and enjoy it.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|We received an advance copy of the Diamond Edition set on October 2nd (this is the one that is released on Oct 6, 2009). The set includes a blue ray copy of the movie, a dvd copy of the movie, and bonus material of the movie on a blue ray. So far we have only watched the 2 movie copies. The case is very cute and has beautiful artwork. From what i understand there are two different covers. I have the Snow White cover. Inside the case you will find a blue ray guide that tells about the restoration of the movie, a scene selection guide, and what's on the bonus disc including minidocumentaries from 1937 of the making of this wonderful movie.     When you put in the disc and get to the play menu its very cute. The magic mirror appears and seems to know that its the first time you are playing the disc and welcomes you to your first time to the show. When you play it again he mentions that you came back for more. And if you stop playing the movie in the middle and come back later he seems to know that as well. My 6 year old thought that was just the coolest thing ever! The movie was restored beautifully and didn't look at all like the vhs version that i remember from when i was a child. Also there is an option to watch the movie in Disney View. Which shows custom artwork of movie curtains in the sidebars. Its very cute.    These days kids seem to want movies to start into the action right away and this movie does start off kinda slow so it was a bit hard for my kids in the start to sit there to watch it. But once the Dwarfs came in they were ready to watch with open eyes and ears. Its quite convenient that it comes with both the blue ray and dvd copies. I put the dvd copy upstairs for the kids to watch and left the blue ray copy downs stairs. This set is a must for anyone parent of anyone who loves Snow White. The kids are already asking to watch it again--for the 3rd day in a row!
B002HNA95E|3.0|When it has came down the 80's, there have been very few artists that have continued to honestly shine briskly in the light. That honestly has been re-discovered recently to music buyers with Michael Jackson's death back in June and with the return of Whitney Houston back in September. But with all of those universal 80's acts that still have been strong, Madonna has still continued to recognize innovation time and time again. It has been over 25 years since she broke out with her mainstream hit Lucky Star, and since then, the \\"Material Girl\\" has been recognized as a definitive icon. Yet, she has had a few greatest hits records over the years that have honestly felt like they have been hits and misses. Now, with her departure from Warner Brothers after over a quarter of a century of tenure, she has released another hits collection. But is this a hit, or just a mixed bag from Madonna? Well, here is the deal on the celebration.<br /><br />Madonna's 2009 greatest hits collection, Celebration is a reflection of Madonna's life and career as the Material Girl. This review is on the double album. The collection includes 36 tracks from Madonna's life and career from her biggest dance songs, to some of her best ballads. The collection includes songs that have been remastered well, but there are some stones that could've been turned in here as well. Still, the collection does include a lot of Madonna's big hits from her classics like Holiday and Material Girl, to recent hits like Hung Up and Hollywood, all the way to her biggest ballads like Live To Tell, and the somber and soulful Take A Bow. Yet, with all of her biggest hits, that are a lot of Madonna's biggest standards that weren't highlighted here are all including the deep This Used To Be My Playground from A League Of Their Own, Human Nature, her ballad from Evita Don't Cry For Me Argentina, the soulful Rain, Ray Of LIght's The Power Of Goodbye, as well as recent tracks like American Life, and Give It To Me. While she does add one new track like Celebration, the song isn't really a definitive track that matches the way Madoonna had been known for during her career.<br /><br />All in all, Madonna has wowed so many auidences for years, but with all of her highlights from being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, to winning more MTV Music Video Awards than any other female artist, she could've honestly brought in a whole lot more into a greatest hits record that really showed more of her strength that she had accomplished that just showed why she has been more than just material. Still if you haven't yet owned a Madonna album, than this would honestly be a good sampler for beginners. Celebration isn't a bad hits collection, but more might've been here just to celebrate.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C+<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: C+one new track like Celebration, the song isn't really a definitive track that matches the way Madoonna had been known for during her career.

She wishes that the Goblin King (David Bowie) who is enamored with her would take Toby away now. Be careful of what you wish for. Toby is whisked off to the goblin King's castle beyond the goblin city and behind a great labyrinth. Now Sarah has just 13 hours to navigate the labyrinth and retrieve Toby if that is what she wants.<br /><br />We get to travel with Sarah through all over trials and tribulations. We get to kibitz don't go this way don't go that way. And you guessed it Sarah does go this way and Sarah does go that way. In the meantime she learns what friendship and fairness is all about and gains a new respect for her new and old friends.<br /><br />This is Jennifer Connelly's third film before quitting the industry to go to college. Of course she is back now and a stronger actress than ever.<br /><br />I've seen this presentation on TV and on VHS. However for some reason I forgot that it was really a musical fantasy even though I knew it had David Bowie. Now with the advent of Blu-Ray I am revisiting all the old films and this one came up on the list. The visuals are spectacular. The voiceover gives you new insights as to what they were trying to do on the movie. Occasionally especially at first it looks like the characters are lip-synching and the sound does not match exactly. Later this is either corrected or you don't notice it anymore.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0018O4YSQ Dark City (Director's Cut) [Blu-ray] ~ Jennifer Connelly]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002NYE Cat People: Original Soundtrack ~ David Bowie]]
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|While the premise seemed promising for about three-quarters of the book, there was no payoff in the end.  Brown seemed to go out of his way to not offend any group or religion.  The last 50-75 pages seemed like research Brown couldn't use any other way than a Prof. Langdon lecture.
B002BFBAWO|4.0|Rollercoasters can be fun but how about spending a whole summer working at the amusement park. Yeah, it reminded my summer job at the grocery store. It was filled with both boredom and simple pleasure from goofing around with the cashiers and baggers. Yeah, everyone can relate to this film and the romance element is just for providing an actual plot rather than random clips. Wow, I am just amazed at the young talent such as Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart. I haven't seen \\"Twilight\\" but this film makes me want to go see it just for Kristen Stewart. She plays the cute, complex tom-boy really well like the Joey Potter character from \\"Dawson's Creek\\". Jesse Eisenberg is the dorky nerd character which is done quite well but don't know if that's really how he is. Basically, low self-esteem in front of others with nervous stuttering and goofy/cool response in awkward situations. Also, the amusement park is itself a character. It reminds me of my childhood days at Johnstone Park (Kiddie Park- Bartlesville, OK) which had rides that you can pay in $0.10 tickets. I love Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader in this film which are deadpans of the managers who have to deal with summer job kids.<br /><br />The DVD has a nice \\"making the film\\" short which has interviews with all the characters. It also goes into how the amusement park was selected and the storyline from the writer/director. By the end of the film, it gets a little cheesy but it's a romance comedy so expect more of the same as \\"Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist\\".

B000BCKFWK|5.0|You can't but admire Robert Rodriguez for achieving his vision of bringing Frankie Miller's graphic novel Sin City, to the big screen.  The result of his dedication and vision, is a stylistic, visually striking, technically impressive, near perfect homage, to Miller's world of crime, violence, romance, revenge, women, and vice.  Miller had no plans for a Sin City film, but when Rodriguez demonstrated to him what the film could be, Miller got onboard the project as a co-director.  Using the graphic novels as the source, Rodriguez clearly envisioned technically how the film could be made, and transformed that concept into a reality that even exceeded the expectations of Frankie Miller, authentically capturing the look, style and atmosphere of Sin City.<br /><br />Another major contributor to the film's success is its amazing cast.  From top to bottom, Rodriguez enlisted a parade of top flight talent that is quite unique.  Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Jessica Alba, Clive Owen, Benicio Del Torro, Jaime King, Carla Gugino, Devon Aoki, Rosario Dawson, and Elijah Wood, head what is one of the more remarkable casts in a film of this decade, one that also includes Powers Boothe, Rutger Hauer, Josh Harnett and Marlee Shelton in minor roles.<br /><br />Presented predominantly in black and white, the original version of Sin City cleverly blends several stories together in a fashion that holds together pretty cohesively, although the tonality of The Big Fat Kill incorporates a  bit more humor than the rest.  The performances are all strong, particularly considering the challenges of acting against a sterile green screen.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke, both rise to the top with gritty, powerful, and emotional performances.<br /><br />There are a ton of extras in this edition, including several commentaries, and numerous featurettes covering various facets of the production.  Lots of cool secrets are revealed in 'Fifteen Minute Film School with Robert Rodriguez'.  Shooting against a green screen, enabled scenic elements to be inserted in post production.  The extent to which this cool technique was employed, can be seen in 'The All Green Screen Version'.  There is also a short documentary about how Frankie Miller was convinced to greenlight and join the production.<br /><br />The film has been recut, with some additional footage added, into the four separate stories, The Customer is Always Right, That Yellow Bastard, The Hard Goodbye, and The Big Fat Kill.  They appear on Disc 2, and can be viewed in any order.  Also included is a copy of The Hard Goodbye graphic novel.

1567184855|5.0|This book by Michael Newton is one of the best I've read on life after life.  Carefully researched, each chapter builds upon the last one as he reviews the lives and soul journeys of his clients.  As I read this book, I felt as though a window was opening and my perspective on so many things began to change, as I was filled with hope instead of the resignation I had been feeling.  I look at life and  life events in a completely different way now.  I have ordered his other book, \\"Destiny of Souls\\" and can't wait to see what awaits.
0385504225|2.0|Oh I had waited SOOO long for this book. I am sorry to say it was a huge disappointment. It is not a thriller. It could have been because there was a creepy story in there but it fell so far short of a page turner. I really had a hard time finishing it. One interesting twist- that's all! I don't know how to categorize this book. Is it historical fiction? Is it a religious treatise? Is it a commercial for the Masons? Truly wish I had not pre-ordered and had read reviews. Might have read it in paperback.

0385504225|4.0|I think some of the reviewers are too hard on Brown's novel, The Lost Symbol.  Brown has definitely caught on to the power of what people are reaidng in the more esoteric parts of book stores these days...positive thoughts, manifestation, power of thoughts etc.  I totally see the formulaic writing he uses however not everyone in the world wants to have to have a dictionary close by to understand the novel.  I am only part of the way through the novel and really enjoying the story.  When I get bored I skim a few paragraphs and it gets interesting again quickly.  I truly dislike some of the characters and dislike how some are portrayed.  This is how an author uses their craft to create a story that keeps people turning pages. The villain gives me the chills.  The \\"heroine\\" makes me proud that Brown can portray a woman as not only brilliantly smart but sexy as well.  I AM enjoying this novel as much as the Di Vinci Code.  I think it is a fun read.  I would tell my friends to enjoy.
B000001E18|5.0|Zooropa is a recording that rewards repeated listening.  Closer attention reveals layer upon layer of sound, strange, machine-like effects and voices. What at first appears to be chaos becomes an almost mathematic and precise logic.  The album is not so much a series of individual tracks, but rather a continuos journey from begining to end.
B0013N7AD8|2.0|Let me make one thing ABUNDANTLY clear. I am a huge Batman fan. I've seen all of the silver screen and small screen incarnations of him, for better or worse. And the simple fact of the matter is that Tim Burton's BATMAN is one of the worst superhero films ever made. It looks cheap and thrown together in a mish-mash of steam-filled, dilapitated buildings, streets and factories. Aside from Anton Furst's art direction, which is superb and matches a maintains a good goth-noir attitude, the sets just look like they were built with papier-mache; it doesn't work as any kind of a story that stays true to the original comic (Batman sure kills a lot of people in this film and seems to be totally okay with that. But what Burton and writer Sam Hamm seemed to forget is that Batman DOESN'T kill. EVER.); the set pieces of the film, like the Art Museum and the ensuing Batmobile chase, and the parade and the Batwing attack (please freeze-frame the moments where Batman is flicking toggle-switches in the Batwing... especially in Blu Ray... because you will very clearly see a toggle marked \\"VOLUME\\". They took apart a stereo and made a control panel... ugh) are terribly unsatisfying, and the worst of the lot is the Cathedral finale... Tim, I know that you want to be the voice for all the goth/emo kids out there, so I can appreciate that you had to give it the full sturm und drang with that scene, but did you have to make it plod on like some kind of soap opera? The script is sub-par even for a \\"comic book\\" movie. It actually felt like these guys had never read a single issue. Oh, and the performances are just horrific. There isn't a single moment that any of these actors have that seem real for their characters. And Keaton as Batman/Bruce Wayne was just awful casting for such a great actor. There wasn't a second I bought him as either Wayne or Batman. He's distant, boring, and charmless as Wayne, and incredibly stiff as Batman. Kim Basinger... well, come on. Need I say more? Jack was the worst of the lot, chewing the scenery like every piece of drywall was covered in chocolate. I'm all for an over-the-top bad guy, but that was almost as bad as Hopkins in the Hannibal Lecter role. Just all wrong. In every way. The only other high point other than Anton Furst? Danny Elfman's score is still great to this day. It's iconic and super-heroic. It's the anti-John Williams SUPERMAN score, and that works because it's Batman. But PRINCE??? No... I'm not even going there.<br /><br />RETURNS suffers from many of the same problems as the first film: Tim Burton's desire to turn every character into some kind of freakshow; the cheapness of the sets, the poorly-constructed and directed action set pieces. But it improves in two ways: The script, mostly reworked by Daniel Waters actually has a great deal of dark humor and wit, which makes the film more entertaining to sit through. And the performances are better. Michelle Pfieffer is wonderful as Catwoman (although it has nothing to do with who Selina Kyle is in the actual comics, I was okay with this interpretation), and Christopher Walken as Max Schreck is grand entertainment. DeVito as The Penguin seemed like perfect casting, but he still plays it like he's a horny Burgess Meredith impersonator. The reason that some of his scenes work pretty well is thanks to Waters' writing. An extremely flawed film, but nowhere near as bad as the first one.<br /><br />Well, I'm done ripping into these films in detail. But I actually will watch the Schumacher-directed films before I'd ever watch either of the Burton films again. BATMAN FOREVER, no matter what people say, at least has a good Batman and a good Bruce Wayne. The Batman in the Schmacher films is athletic and dynamic, as opposed to the Robo-Bat that Burton showed us. And Val Kilmer was a good Wayne as well. He has a lot more wit and charm. Yes, Carrey is as annoying as ever; Tommy Lee Jones was horribly miscast as Two-Face; Chris O'Donnell... Hot Knife and a Wet PaperBag should give a few clues. Nicole Kidman has never looked sexier than she did in FOREVER, though.<br /><br />BATMAN AND ROBIN is such an amazing train-wreck of a film that its watchability is almost hypnotic. As you watch it, you can't BELIEVE that someone actually agreed to put that script and those performances to film, but you just can't look away. It should have cult film status.a few clues.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|The CD is absolutely awesome. I still think \\"Dirt\\" is their best, but this is still a great come back. Great intensity, lyrics and some of the beats are just raw. Glad to have them back!

B001LOU8ME|5.0|This is a great live disc from the michael schenker group or msg for short. Michael had left the great hard rock outfit UFO and preceded to put out three great solo records.  This disc features songs from those three discs and a ufo track. Right after this msg would put out 'built to destroy\\" and then another live disc before schenker went on to the mcauley schenker group, contraband, ufo and then back to msg.  This live disc is remastered and features more songs than any other version.  It features msg at their peak powers and sharp melodic riffing.  Melodic hard rock has always been the best artistic brand of heavy metal in my opinion and this disc showcases that brand to it's live limit.
0439023491|4.0|This was a highly anticipated book, and it definitely did not disappoint. I actually pre-ordered this, something I haven't done since Harry Potter #5. The story picks up almost a year after the Hunger Games ended, with Katniss and Peeta now living in the winner's village and trying to recover some semblance of a normal life. Katniss still isn't sure how to deal with Peeta and Gale and definitely isn't sure how she truly feels about either of them. And worse of all, it will soon be time for another Games, and no one knows what the Capitol has planned for the Quarter Quell, the 75th anniversary of the games. Katniss knows she is still on the President's naughty list, and there's no way she can feel safe.<br /><br />I refuse to post any spoilers, but I assure you that it's not what you expect. This book is a lot more political, as we learn more about the districts and how life truly is throughout Panem.  There's not quite as much suspense or heavy violence here as in The Hunger Games, but the ending will leave you breathless and dying for the next book.
0385504225|1.0|I can't believe I wasted my money and bought this book.  I loved Angels and Demons, and I thought DaVinci Code was pretty good, but this book was just terrible.  A dumbed down recycling of his past books.  Please, save yourselves the money, and if you still really really want to read Lost Symbol, just check it out from the library.  I wish I had.
0307269981|5.0|As much as I enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, I liked this even more.  When the story begins, Mikael Blomkvist has regained his status as one of Sweden's foremost journalists, thanks to the continued success of Millennium and the popularity of his book about the Wennerstrom affair. But he hasn't seen Lisbeth Salander for nearly a year, despite stopping by her apartment on a regular basis hoping to catch her. Salander, who has also benefited from the Wennerstrom/Vanger affair, has decided to go on a bit of a vacation across Europe and the Caribbean, keeping tabs on things at home (including her ne'er do well \\"guardian\\" and Blomkvist) in her own special way. Both find themselves involved in an investigation of human trafficking, in quite different ways.<br /><br />It's when Salander is accused of a series of brutal crimes that you realize what a genius character Larsson has created.  Because despite how much you like Salander and want to root for her, you completely believe that she *could* have done it -- or at least I did.  And it's a very long time before you discover the truth, with each scene without Salander in it making you wonder even more.<br /><br />I can't recommend this trilogy enough.  It has suspense, mystery, relationships, and a little bit of social commentary. However, if you can't handle cliffhangers, I would wait until the third book, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, is released (June 2010!). As soon as you finish this one, you'll be ready for it.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|\\"Fracture\\" presents brilliant performances by Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.  Gosling plays a tough Deputy District Attorney assigned to prosecute a pathological killer (Hopkins) who has murdered his philandering wife.  Gosling hopes to escape the DA's office to a high-salary position with a big law firm, when he is assigned this one last case.  The film becomes a battle of two brilliant minds as Hopkins' well-laid scheme appears to thwart the DA's office and leave the prosecutor in disgrace.  But events keep twisting, and more would be telling.  This is one of the finest legal crime dramas that I have seen in many years, and it is extraordinarily excellent entertainment.  By the way, the musical theme in this film is superb, and adds to the atmosphere and drama.  I was rivetted at every turn, and I would recommend this film to anyone.  RJB.
0393062430|4.0|A good book for a slow entry into the world of game theory. Some things are a bit wordy and hard to understand with few pictures/mathematical formulas, but nonetheless it is a good practical book for getting your feet wet.
B0019OP0GU|3.0|Love the book.  The movie is a bit weak, but sweet.  Worth a watch if you're a fan of the book and Emma Watson.
B00164KYV4|3.0|First the good. This movie has some interesting characters that you end up caring about by the end. It's a watchable movie that has some engaging dialog and even some lighthearted scenes. It's supposed to center around signals people give off and the difficulties in relationships. It's done in a somewhat unique way by having narration that pokes fun of dating and relationship stereotypes between scenes. The story itself revolves around an ensemble of characters, many of whom are friends, relatives or colleagues of each other. There are a number of relationship story lines, some of which end up happy and some that don't. All in all this is a fairly well-acted movie that has basically no scenes that make you cringe.<br /><br />All of this being said, there were a couple of things I didn't like so much about the movie. First of all, the initial scenes were a bit confusing because the characters and their relationships were not well-introduced. It took a while to sort out who was who. Second, with such a large cast, some of the story-lines and characters seemed almost peripheral and excessive. There was a whole subplot with a sister of one of the main characters that was not very well-developed or meaningful to the main plot. As with many movies like this, you wonder if maybe a few less subplots might have allowed the remaining ones to be a little better-developed. Finally, while this is par for the course in a romantic-type movie, you could see the results of a few of the story lines coming a mile a way. Probably the most engaging relationship is the one between the girl who has most of the issues and the bartender who is supposed to be not at all interested but becomes a good friend. It's fairly obvious in their first scene that they will end up together in the end and they do.<br /><br />This movie is worth checking out if you like romantic movies. You will probably end up feeling like it was very similar to other movies you've seen, but it's still quite well-done and enjoyable.
B0025KVLSI|5.0|I have never listened to any pop rock (pre folk-rock) song that grabs my attention more than John Lennon's No Reply does to this day. The opening album's side is sheer perfection from start to finish, launching Lennon's direct and introspective vulnerability in his lyrics and his sincere vocal delivery like a rocket, driving straight into your heart, supported by Macca on meticulous high harmonies. The production is impeccable, as is the remastering. Had No Reply been released as a single at the time, it would have shot straight to number one! As for the follow-up sides, the Beatles excellence continues to expand and progress.<br /><br />There is no need for defending this release with respect to the Beatles' alleged imperfections due to exhaustion. They were always known for working great under pressure and this album proves it. Their vocals are like calluses in that they are only strengthened by their non-stop schedules and performances. I could listen to Lennon's cover of Rock and Roll Music a million times and never grow tired of repeated listenings. Macca's I'll Follow the Sun is gorgeous and eloquent - faultless vocals and, again, single release status and number one caliber. There is not one weak song - cover or original performance on this album, so there is no need to excuse or reason to forgive.<br /><br />Anyone of these songs could have been a single. They are all expressive, powerful and mesmerizing. If the Beatles had released only one album during their brief career, this would have epitomized their talent and been an open and shut case. There are NO explanations or apologies to be made whatsoever on Beatles for Sale! I highly recommend it and have bought the remaster five times - one in the stereo box set, one in the mono box set (not offered as a single purchase as the stereo is), one for my studio, one for my car and one as a gift for my daughters.
0375842209|5.0|In Germany, during World War II, a young girl named Liesel is taken in by an unusual family who also takes in a Jew and hides him in their basement. Liesel deals with death and loss at the beginning of the novel when her brother dies and her mother leaves her with the foster family. The narrator, death, recounts the circumstances involving each book that she steals and the relationships with her adopted Papa, his wife, and the Jewish man that hides in the basement. Through the narrator's eyes, the reader also witnesses Liesel's relationships to a boy named Rudy, her best friend from the neighborhood, and a woman whose library she visits, stealing another book with each visit. Her relationships to the characters in the novel are filled with love and loss, and the narrator's commentary adds a unique angle. He seems to be fascinated with the girl and even odder, he seems to have compassion for the people whose souls he takes. The author, Markus Zusak, has created a novel that reads like poetry, filled with horror and beauty. The language is colorful, pun intended, touching and often satirical.  Death, loss, war, genocide, compassion, forgiveness, love, the nature of the soul, the nature of evil, censorship and book burning are all explored in this novel. Since the book deals with war, genocide and death it may be difficult for some young adults to read, but it is well-worth it.
B000VBIEXS|2.0|This is a wonderful album, remastered to cd, it's certainly the worst effort at remastering I've ever heard, i made the mistake of not reading reviews before my purchase, had I read them, I would have passed this up.
B000RE6198|5.0|The people that complain about these lyrics \\"not suitable for children\\", \\"dark\\".  What do you expect?  It talks about that in the description! Don't hate on it when it says that right there in your face.<br /><br />Anyways, This was an amazing album to listen to.  It fit most of my years in junior high and high school perfectly.
0307341550|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed listening to the unabridged version of this audiobook.  The character of Camille was very believable and the cutting aspect of her personality, and how she chose to cut, was just brilliant.  For those like me, who \\"read\\" via books-on-tape, the narrator did an EXCELLENT job, becoming almost \\"invisible\\" as the story progressed.  The mystery aspect of the book actually worked for me, and I was surprised by whodunit;+)  Very entertaining overall.  I actually read her latest, Dark Places, FIRST, and liked it enough to look at what else she had to offer--I think that speaks for itself.  Keep 'em coming Gillian!!

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|With their 10th theatrical release 'Up' Pixar continues to prove that they are the best film production studio out there today. Continually improving their animating abilities (no matter what Pixar movie it is I am awestruck at the quality) and writing ORIGINAL (sans the very average Cars) stories, the geniuses out west could take the easy route but that is not the Pixar way.<br /><br />If you have seen the trailers you are no doubt focused on the balloons that carry the lead role away in his house but the main focus is that this is a LOVE STORY. The first 10 minutes are some of Pixar's best work ever which is very analogous to the first 30 minutes of WALL-E which is brought down by a very average 2nd and 3rd act (WALL-E). We learn of Carl Fredricksen falling in love with Elle, are quickly shown highlights of their happy life together and their continual goal to go on a great adventure in South America. A great adventure that they never were able to take together due to lack of money and Elle's death (this is a deeper movie than other Pixar productions so be prepared to talk to your kids).<br /><br />After Elle is gone, Carl decides that he must take action to go on that adventure they never got to do. Along the way he meets up with a young boy, talking dog(s), crazy bird and an antagonist that Karl must defeat.<br /><br />The animation in Up is of course top notch. The story is creative and original, and it's a joy to watch. The only thing that hurts this movie is it's not very kid-friendly in my opinion. I took my 4 1/2 year old daughter and 30 minutes in she wanted to leave (we stayed for the whole thing). I feel the main audience for this movie is adults and senior citizens (yes I am serious) with children and teenagers second this time around. Kids will probably like it but not like Toy Story, Monsters or Nemo.<br /><br />For fun I will rank the Pixar movies according to me but this is completely subjective. If you search the web about the only constant you will find is that Cars is the weakest movie, as for the rest, everyone has their favorites.<br /><br />#01 The Incredibles<br />#02 Monsters, Inc.<br />#03 Finding Nemo<br />#04 Ratatouille<br />#05 WALL-E<br />#06 Up<br />#07 Toy Story 2<br />#08 Toy Story<br />#09 A Bug's Life<br />#10 Cars<br /><br />***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDeakest movie, as for the rest, everyone has their favorites.     #01 The Incredibles   #02 Monsters, Inc.   #03 Finding Nemo   #04 Ratatouille   #05 WALL-E   #06 Up   #07 Toy Story 2   #08 Toy Story   #09 A Bug's Life   #10 Cars     ***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
1416594787|5.0|This book is a must read.    I think this book is written very well. You do not have to be a scientist to read it.   Richard Dawkins does great work in laying out his scientific mind in an easy to read manor.    The problem is that the people who really SHOULD be reading this book; probably will not.  Especially, if the people that should read it know of Richard Dawkins's disdain for religion.    I say to those people try to put those feelings aside and read this book. It is very much worth every single penny!!    Thanks for reading my review.
1416955070|5.0|This is a splendid introduction to an exquisitely described world \\"peopled\\" by a variety of half-humans and half something else who are for good or evil, or strictly for themselves, or against...  The characters are very beautifully painted with the eloquence of words well-written. There are the usual surprises and some extra, unusual surprises. Reading this book makes me glad I work with young people, for whom the book was written.  It also makes me very glad the sequels are both already published!  I hate waiting for the next book!  Smile.
B0017V7GLC|5.0|Incredible! This album delivers! It will blow you away! Make sure that you crank the bass up on this album.
1573300403|5.0|As stated by previous reviewers, this dvd has a ton of amazing videos! But what makes it even better is the Motown 25 performance; One of his best ever performances of his career! And the amazing VMA performance where he takes several of his songs and turns it into a masterpiece! This is definitely a necessity for any Michael Jackson fan!
B001SN78JO|4.0|I'm liking the new Jim Carrey. More mature but still spontaneous and a little wacky. Lots of funny parts and generally a good family movie (just a couple parts that are questionable but the young ones probably won't notice and the teenagers probably will like oh-come-on-mom-and-dad). A general feel-good movie.
1400049628|3.0|People laugh when you mention zombies,but Vodoo has been around for centuries and the way man plays with DNA and  chemicals who really knows what can  be developed.  The terminator  we're not there yet but we are getting there.  So i say it i would rather be prepared than not.   the book does give information om weapons and diffrent types of transportation places to hide out or build survival camps with plus and minuses for each that could be applied in diffrent circumstances. The book is supposed to be fiction which is like kidding right.  Don't they say there is always truth in kidding.  Like it fun to read who knows you may just pick up some info that may help you get out of a bad situation ..   I've also read a couple of his other stuff good 3 stars
0385504225|1.0|This book was a waste of time (trust me, I just finished it).  Wait for the money, it will save you days of precious time that you can actually spend doing something productive.
B001PR0YFS|2.0|The problem with this movie is that it tries to make something funny out of something that isn't supposed to be funny. I mean, yes this movie is a true story and yes it could have been good. But the problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny and tongue in cheek, and doesn't work. Matt Damon turns in a solid performance as Whitacre, which saves the movie from sucking. The portrayal of the price mixing scandal, which was a big event, was not very well done, and normally would be considered a serious event. I mean, if this movie were fiction perhaps It'd be funny. But this is basically trying to make us laugh about such a serious event that happened. I laughed maybe once in the movie, and other than that this movie was useless. Che 1 and 2 were good but dull, Ocean's Thirteen was total crap. And that said, sorry Steven Soderbugh, but your time is almost up.
B0029LHW4U|3.0|I was lucky enough to see Alice In Chains (with new singer William DuVall) in concert a few years ago and they were incredible.  All the old classics sounded great and DuVall fit in perfectly.  Unfortunately on this album, the band's new lead singer is nearly absent.  The majority of the vocals are handled by guitarist Jerry Cantrell, which is fine, but that makes this more of a Cantrell solo album than AIC disc.      The best track on the album, IMO, is \\"Last Of My Kind,\\" the one in which DuVall is co-writer and main singer.  I personally enjoy his voice and think he is a great replacement for Layne Staley.  He sings with a lot of passion and doesn't try to imitate Layne.  On the rest of the disc, however, Cantrell and co. try desparately to sound like old Alice In Chains.  The set is very similar to 1995's self titled LP, with Cantrell doing most the singing.  His vocals are multi-layered, which at times eerily makes it sound like Layne is singing with him!  A nice tribute, but is that really what we (or Staley) would want.  I mean this is basically a brand new band.  I'm sure there's plenty of AIC tribute bands out there who sound just like them.  This record should be different.  A new beginning.          I read that Cantrell was worried about tarnishing the reputation of Alice In Chains with this album.  They haven't done that.  Unfortunately they haven't added anything new either.  And the song themselves aren't as catchy or addictive as a lot of AIC classics, of which many were written by Cantrell.  That makes it surprising.  There's nothing on here that would make it on an \\"Essential Alice In Chains\\" collection.  \\"Check My Brain\\" and \\"A Looking In View\\" show that Cantrell can still right a great hook.  I just wish the band would have concentrated more on songwriting and incorporating DuVall into the band that trying to emulate the old Chains sound.         Overall, I'm still glad the band is together and dared to release a new album.  The good thing is thisis the start of a second chapter of the band, so hopefully there's more new music to come.  I think the band should take \\"Last Of My Kind\\" and expand on that idea.  DuVall's a great singer and songwriter.  They should feature him a lot more on the next album.
B001QXE0OC|1.0|This Disney CD will not inspire young listeners who like Miley Cyrus.  The tunes are dull and repetitive--pretty much all about losing a boy.  And Selena's voice isn't  strong like her friend Demi Levato's is.  This seems like an attempt to create a pop star out of a very average girl. The CD cover is bizarre, as are many of the inside photos.  This is a girl who is pretending to be a pop star.  Thankfully she didn't write the songs (unlike some of her other Disney pals) and a couple of these tunes may have worked for an adult artist with a better voice, but here they fall flat.    This CD really rates 1 and 1/2 stars (it's not a complete failure but doesn't have enough on it to deserve even two stars) but it doesn't help that some who rate it one star only say they hate her voice.  Her voice isn't terrible--it's just nothing special and this CD seems like a way for Disney to squeeze money out of young fans. Instead of going the route of finding catchy songs that kids can sing along to (such as you'll find on the Wizards of Waverly Place CD), they decided to make her try to sound more mature with adult tunes but fall short. Namely, it's disappointing.    There's nothing wrong with the music that would keep a parent from buying it--it's just boring. Don't let the one or two \\"hits\\" (Falling Down, Tell Me Something) fool you--buy them off iTunes and skip paying for the entire CD.
B002HNA95E|4.0|Madonna \\"Celebration\\" is an incomplete  retrospective of an influential pop star. As many reviews have pointed out this  by no means is a complete anthology. What the cd is. is  a dizzying celebration of this womans achievements as a song writer and billboard charter. The decision not to sequence the compilation in chronological order actually deters from highlighting Madonna's growth as an artist. Also the weird edits to some of the tracks is baffling like cutting the intro to \\"Dress You Up\\" is frankly bizarre and random. What's good here is that fans finally get remastered versions of \\"Into the Groove\\",\\"Who's That Girl?\\", \\"Justify My Love\\",\\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Express Yourself\\" (albeit the video edit). Celebration also includes two new tracks \\"Revolver\\", \\"Celebration\\" on CD and if you download the deluxe edition you also get \\"It's So Cool\\". The three new tracks don't take or add anything to the album. For long time Madonna fans like myself this collection is a pot boiler as I already had most of what's on here however I'm also a completist so I did purchase it. Out of the two disc collection the first disc is the stronger of the two as the second begins to drag because of the random sequencing and track selection leaving this listener a little bored. Even with that said this a good set for the begining or casual Madonna fan.

0385504225|5.0|Dan Brown's three \\"Robert Langdon\\" books take readers on a tour of interesting places, provide historical and non-historical information about long-standing myths, legends, and rumors (and some realities), and along the way, entertain with spectacular twists and turns.<br /><br />I was completely entertained by \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" The Langdon character could be considered the personification of [...] -- a myth-buster of the nth degree. The character's reiteration of skepticism seems to be the author's way of reminding readers that this is, after all, a work of fiction -- laced with facts, to be sure -- but still a work of fiction. (And who among us doesn't \\"see\\" Tom Hanks as we picture the events in our minds?)<br /><br />Come along for the ride! The villain is well realized; the all-too-human heros and heroines are mostly beliveable, and the description of ascending to high, precarious places will have anyone suffering from vertigo experiencing a twinge of tummy flutters (ditto those who are claustrophobic when characters descend to the bowels of the Capitol building). As a plus, the descriptions of various buildings and sites in Washington, D.C., will make fine additions to one's must-see list when next visiting our nation's capitol.<br /><br />This leads to the question: what next for Langdon, this modern-day intellectual Indiana Jones?
0385504225|2.0|I don't read Dan Brown for great literature. I read him for a good story and suspense, such as he provided in The DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons. Both are lacking in The Lost Symbol. I soldiered on because I had paid for the book, but it says everything that 20 pages from the end I turned off the light and went to sleep. No page turning thriller here. A real disappointment.
0385504225|3.0|I made a reservation for this book with the expectation indeed that I wont get Literature with a capital L. Im counting not on good writing and fantastic insight but more on the extra mileage--yes it can prompt me to Google and research more on some of the purported \\"Facts\\" used in the fiction    In the end this really is something you finish very fast, more of a junk-food of a book. You won't expect going back to any sentence to savor any well-turned phrase. Instead one should expect the clichés, and overused adjectives.     Dan Brown repeated so many times \\"staring right in the face,\\" \\"so obvious,\\" \\"it was so simple\\" too much in each revelation, it's a bit annoying. There's also \\"starled,\\" \\"stared in horror,\\" \\"held his breath,\\" peppered in generously. To any reader, as an appeasement, I recommend you just credit everything to writing style. Just plow long. Dan Brown anyway is now a confirmed master as of now of cliffhanger chapters. He makes it a point that you keep on reading--this is a credit.      My primary problem in the book is in its building up to a very shallow prize (relative to the Da Vinci Code). The last pages are almost a disappointment because of this. The ending made me ask... \\"that's it?\\" To my mind, it's unbelievable for an organization to go to great lengths to hide in symbol something so not worth it.  This makes the book weaker than the Da Vinci Code. I wonder whether the author tried to avoid too much controversy in writing this one or this is really the conspiracy thing lined up for discussion. I think even the first National Treasure movie (also regarding masons) one-upped the book in this regard.     Also as mentioned elsewhere, it's almost the same package, half of the book: the single assassin who had to be naked again, an intelligent lady partner with a personal stake, running from authorities, the running, and escaping so close, etcetera. Im sure Ron Howard is now scratching his head, thinking about putting into film another book of the same exact flow.     Finally, was it worth my money and time nonetheless. I believe, yes. Still good entertainment. And Circumpunct is a funny word, I don't know why it sounds funny to me. Circumpunct! Say it out loud! Makes me smile everytime.
0385504225|3.0|Most of the reviews here are dead on so I'm not going go into the plot.  This book was kind of like a roller coaster ride.  It started very slowly but eventually got very interesting and fun, and at the end, wound up screeching to a halt.  The end of the book was the most disappointing.  In his previous books, Dan Brown managed to surprise and awe us with the final revelation; however, in The Lost Symbol, this isn't the case.  While, I enjoyed the whole ride, I was left wanting much more in the final chapters.  Honestly, I hope they don't make a movie out of this, or if they do, at least change the ending to something much more satisfying.  I do hope Dan Brown continues to write more books, I really enjoy his in depth research and his way of exposing real-life societies.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|The video arrived before the intended date and was in great condition. I would recommend working with this company.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|I think everyone should know the Zombie Survival Rules.  After all, the zombie plague could happen any day now.  So, I believe Zombieland should be required viewing.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that comic performances by Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin (along with a special appearance by Bill Murray) keep you laughing until your sides hurt. Zombies have always had an ironic comedic quality to them and Zombieland ramps it up to the max.  From the first frames when we see a zombie stripper wearing pasties and a g-string to a zombie carpool Mom with little girl zombies in party dresses hanging off her minivan bumper,  the audience is taken on a roller coaster ride of laughs and thrills.  Yes, it is gorey and sometimes stupid but it is FUN!  And, with lines like \\"Nut up or Shut Up\\" and \\"Double Tap\\", it's sure to be one of those movies that will live on - even if only in drunken reveries.  Zombieland has no sacred cows.  Everthing and everyone in modern culture is subject to its rapier wit.  This is not a movie for young kids due to the language and gore.  But, if you're a grown up, and you still haven't prepared for the zombie apocalypse, don't panic.  Zombieland is now playing at a theater near you.  See it now while there is still time.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|If you like loud grunge rock in its pure sense, you should rate this last Alice in chains album >4 stars.<br />Any rating &lt;5 stars shows you don't like loud grunge rock. It's as simple as rock itself!
0307473465|4.0|I must admit, this book is not the best book ever, but it is a good book nonetheless. There are a few parts I found rather boring but for the most part, I was well into the book and enjoying the characters. What I like about \\"The Reader\\" is that it is a love story without a happy ending. It's a lot like real life and very believable. Since the book is translated from German, I found that the book wasn't beautifully written. I'm sure if I could read German there would be much more emotion to this book. The book is very short as well, so it's something that one can read on the weekend or so.

B001N44BVQ|4.0|This is a very good movie, it takes a while to get to the action, but when it gets started I think you will feel it was worth the wait. Mr. dicaprio was kind hard to take him as a real CIA officer, russell crowe, played the part of a un-trusthworthy, crummy CIA boss he really sucked, it's might be true, that how they are in real life, it's local is the  middle east. That country is a real piece of dirt, it's too bad we have loss so many good American troops there.
B002LVVCIK|5.0|\\"Capitalism\\" opens with disclaimer from some old film, and then segues into scenes from police videos of people robbing banks and convenience stores. Moore likes to make comparisons. In this case he wants to show us who the real thieves are, and they don't tend to be desperate drug addicts wearing hoodies.<br /><br />To me that's what Moore's latest film is: a cinematic treatise on crime. Moore uses his excellent skills as an editor to piece together films in a manner that makes you want to scream \\"Where does he find this stuff?\\" to paint a telling picture of what America is: a plutocracy. And yes, Mike uses that word and wants us all to learn it, even providing a definition straight out of a textbook.<br /><br />What Moore also excels at is humanizing crises and the class war by showing us just who's affected by these forces and why. We're shown people, real people being thrown out of their homes, being pushed out of their jobs, being paid meager salaries to do dangerous, complicated work, and being informed that companies profited from the deaths of their loved ones through something called \\"dead peasant insurance.\\"<br /><br />He even speaks to various clergy to try and find any sort of modern moral justification for capitalism. He can't. One priest even goes as far as to state flatly that \\"Capitalism is radically evil.\\"<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Speaking of all things radical, Moore puts himself on the line by trying to raid the offices of financial institutions, implores us to do the same, and backs that strategy up by showing current examples of how dissent and popular revolt can turn the tables on the gluttons in power, even if those victories are as small as one family being allowed to stay in their foreclosed home and window factory workers given severance payments after a long sit-in.<br /><br />However, what \\"Capitalism\\" isn't is a mere bleeding-heart piece that is all emotion. Mike tends to do his homework. And that's what makes him a firebrand. The evidence is laid bare for the viewer to see.<br /><br />There are some who would call Michael Moore and his documentaries \\"anti-American.\\" He's even told by one Wall Streeter to \\"stop making movies\\" when trying to get an accurate definition of what are called \\"derivatives.\\"  Although I would definitely call Moore a subversive, I challenge anyone to find an ounce of hatred towards America in this piece. No, Michael Moore loves America, but his America is made up of those who toil and have little or nothing. His America is being looted by people that can only be described as white-collar sociopaths who would be selling heroin or whoring out young girls had they not been brought up in wealthy families.<br /><br />You also get a generous serving of Michael's trademark humor to make it all go down easier. It has been said that the best way to take the powerful down a peg or two is by poking fun at them, and Moore doesn't just poke at them, he runs them through with swords of bitingly comedic steel.<br /><br />If I had one gripe about \\"Capitalism\\" it would be that there was so much more ground that could have been covered. That's why I feel that a sequel is in order as well as a prequel since Moore rather glosses over earlier American history. But I suppose that's what he have Howard Zinn for.<br /><br />Yes, this is a paramount polemic against capitalism and dare I say FOR socialism. Even Bernie Sanders gets some facetime.<br /><br />As someone who has been identifying as a socialist for years, I can say that it only reinforced my belief that the free market is unsustainable, as if my personal experience as an American worker hasn't been enough to do so. Demons lurk in the details though, and Moore not only shines a light of veracity on them, he also splashes them with holy water, as any left-leaning Catholic such as Moore would.<br /><br />Christ wasn't a capitalist sympathizer, something Moore also shows us, and neither is Moore himself. So why should you be? It's not inyour best interests to be one. Think of this as an intervention by way of motion picture for your friends and family who are thoroughly in love with an abusive spouse that is all take and no give.<br /><br />Talk about a great candidate for an ABC Sunday Night Movie. If I could hold screenings for \\"Capitalism\\" I would. It needs to be seen by far more people than any action/adventure blockbuster.<br /><br />Thanks for makin' the devils hiss, Mike. And for making socialism taste so good.ure for your friends and family who are thoroughly in love with an abusive spouse that is all take and no give.

It's more than comparable: it's recommended for fans of the movie.
B0000024W3|4.0|I wasn't born when this album came out, if I was I'm sure my opinion of 'Self Portrait' would be different.  From what I understand this album angered a great deal of people when it came out.  Many felt it was below the standards Bob Dylan had set for himself in the sixties.  I imagine at the time this album was released that it would have been a disappointment after Dylan masterpieces like 'Blonde on Blonde', 'Highway 61 Revisited', etc...    I have gotten into Dylan's work like nobody's business over the past few years.  I have snatched up all the noteworthy albums from the sixties, seventies, and most of his recent works.  After gobbling up, and absorbing all of these, I've found myself wanting to hear more, and I have been scraping the proverbial 'bottom of the barrel', and checking out some of his not-so-well-received-albums.  I must say...I really enjoyed this one.  It's a laid back, often silly, fun record.  It's definitely not to be taken seriously.    I like to think of this album as one of 'The Bootleg Series' from Dylan's country experiments.  If you do the same, then I do believe it is possible to thoroughly enjoy 'Self Portrait'.    However, if you bought this when it came out, then perhaps this would be impossible for you...understandably.  I'd probably still be pissed too.

0385504225|5.0|\\"I'm pretty sure it went down like this,\\" a Hollywood snapshot of the genesis of Dan's Brown's latest, is hilarious, and the author who penned it has oodles and oodles of talent; that's plain to see. However, having read \\"The Lost Symbol\\"  I cannot for the life of me see justification for the author of the review, Valannin, a fellow writer according to his website, to rate the book one star. One star ratings typically reflect one of two things: either the book is sufficiently without merit,  incoherent,  one of the worst books in print or, the reviewer has a chip on his shoulder. In this case, it appears to be the latter.  If one is going to be strictly honest, Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is a monstrous work of research and effort. As a thriller, it falls short due to some rather lame plotting and a weak climax but for many readers, myself included, the journey that Brown creates, a voyage filled with conspiracy theories  and magic and mysticism,  is the key to his success. This is what keeps us turning pages late into the night. And in some ways, this journey reminds me of James Redfield's  \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\" in as-much as both, although disparate in story and setting, are really metaphysical lessons packed into fiction wrappers.  Some people wouldn't dream of picking up a metaphysical handbook such as \\"The Seven Spiritual Laws of Success\\" by Deepak Chopra or Rhonda Byrne's \\"The Secret,\\" but learning from fiction is a very novel idea, and Dan Brown manages to do it as well, if not better than anyone on the planet.  If you do not believe that we humans are Creators and that our thoughts are potent tools of physical, material creation you might not  might enjoy \\"The Lost Symbol\\" as much as I did and you might not be as forgiving for some of Brown's ramblings and repetitiveness. If you find objection to Brown's  scientific molds, I respectfully submit that you think back to the days of HG Wells and Jules Verne--flying to the moon, ridiculous, journeying to thebottom of the sea, farcical.  If on the other hand, you are willing to suspend judgments and comparisons, and if you are willing to take the plunge into the world of fiction where some things require a leap in faith or a suspension in belief (as in most fiction) then you might find Dan Brown's \\"The Lost Symbol\\" to be quite a ride, worth every penny.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Alice is not simply a band, she is a living breathing creation- Jerrys muse and clearly his motivation for living.   Bringing her back from the dead is a feat nothing short of a miracle, how often do you see a corpse re-animated   with such vigor and unholy determination? Answer: NEVER! The album in reality sounds like on never ending   track of could be singles, there is not a weak moment or stumble on the disc from heavy beginning to beautiful end.   The band is unbelievably tight after more than a decade long hiatus, there are moments on the album that make   you stop and go \\"Really? Did I just hear that? Amazing!\\" It is a somewhat uncanny eulogy for their fallen friend and   band mate Layne and his legacy, that they return with an album that sounds as haunted by his ghost as anything he   recorded while he was with them. The album is a wake for Layne, and that becomes clear in the album title as well   as the melancholy lyrics Jerry writes in his memory. But as they each say their own personal goodbyes on the album,   the band in their own way also finds a common bond and strength that allows them to push forward into the future   without harboring guilt or having to become needlessly nostalgic.     Track Listing Below:    All Secrets Known: Hope, A New Beginning/Time, Time to Start Living, Just Like Before  We Died, sings Jerry in the first lines of this ethereal opening track to their fist studio  album in almost 14 years and the first since the untimely passing of Layne. The track is  the audio companion for the exhumation of Alices body (And Jerrys MO) from the  grave she was buried in over a decade ago. The wooden box is slowly pulled out of the  ground and pry-bars are inserted under the lid as Cantrell delivers the second verse  Hurt, Falling through Fingers, Trust, Trust in the Feeling , Theres Something Left Inside.  Jerry knows there are things inside the box he has to face to bring Alice back to life,  things he tried to burry years ago but they kept coming back from the crypt to haunt him,  to try and fill him with guilt and remorse. Finally the lid is removed from the oblong box  and Jerry stands alone in front of it ready to face her, Alice, for the first time since he  created her he finally feels a sense of peace as he sings; Calm, All Wounds are  Healing, Strong, The Truth is Worth Saving, I Want to Feel Alive. The camera pans and  we the audience see her, a withered but still strikingly beautiful face illuminated by the  moonlight for a moment, until a cloud passes in front of the silver lunar body and all is  shadows once more. But Jerrys voice calls out from the darkness like a Buddhist monk  who has completed his journey to the top of the mountain, Theres no going back to the  Place We Started From, All Secrets Known.    Check My Brain: From the moment the grinding guitars start building momentum  towards what becomes a MONSTER of a rock anthem you become fully aware that  Alice has been revived! Musically it feels one part Ted Nugent, one part Black Sabbath  and one part classic AIC. Jerry and William blend their vocals together so seamlessly  you almost think they are the same person in two different bodies. This is one of the  best rock tracks I have EVER heard! Lyrically we follow Jerry on a long, strange trip that  sounds like something from a Hunter S. Thompson novel. He weaves his way into Cali  trying to stay alive long enough to come back with a story to tell, as his mental abilities  are stretched beyond their limits in the land of broken boulevards and shattered dreams.  Jerry unleashes the chorus like a dog on a chain, California, Im Fine/ Somebody Check  My Brain/ Californias Alright/ Somebody Check My Brain. The track builds like a giant  fuzz bubble rapidly expanding with lines like, I Walked These Streets A Creep In The  Fog/ When She Sang I Answered The Call, Oh Yeah. The song clearly states Jerrys  feeling of ennui from the experience as he lets us in first hand on the dramaand gonzo  like depravity that formed his escapade. It feels about as close as you can get to waking  up in a California hostel with a hangover, replaying the night before in your mind in  fragments while you try to understand how you are still alive as you stumble outside to  face another day.    Last of My Kind: This is the first track that gives you a taste of new singer William  Duvalls chops as the lead. He doesn't disappoint. He never crosses a line of familiarity  that would be so easy to do by imitating Layne. Instead he forages in his own direction  delivering Jerrys lyrics as if he were the original architect. The track is a pounding brutal  assault delivering some of the heaviest vocals and riffs ever heard on a AIC album.   Sean beats the drums into a bloody submission giving the track a quasi-evil-tribal feeling,   pushing the limits of his primal style and elevating the entire band with  outstanding percussion. Williams voice matches the mood of the song and delivers a  memorable chorus of pent up angst and righteous contempt that never felt so good  coming from a band that was declared legally dead by the music industry.    Your Decision: The acoustic intro sends a shiver up your spine for a moment as you  expect to hear Laynes voice dive into \\"Down In A Hole,\\" but Jerrys somber vocal  breaks the trance delivering one of the most solid tracks on the album in true AIC form.  The song sounds like it could have easily been on Dirt or Facelift except for the content  of the lyrics depicting a past event instead of a present hell. Jerrys cuts like a knife  delivering ultimatums and allegories about being deceived and let down over and over,  while still holding out hope for a reconciliation that seems forever out of reach. We know  what weighs heavily on his mind as he sings, No one plans to take the path that brings  you lower/ And here you stand before us all and say, its over. You can hear the  disappointment and hurt in his voice, but also the deep love and care he has for the  subject in question. He isn't pointing a finger in judgement but acts as more of an  observer. He wants to stop the slow motion wreck that is playing out in front of his eyes  but he can only watch from a distance, letting the consequences speak for themselves.  The song is a chilling and unforgettable reminder of the bands history and the long and  painful journey that has brought them to the creation of this album. The story behind the  song haunts you long after the music fades.    A Looking In View: Another brilliant track that sounds very much like classic AIC, it  sounds a bit like a metal version of the Gordon Lightfoot classic \\"Sundown.\\" Not so  much in style but in emphasis of lyrical content. Jerry becomes the proverbial bard of  this track narrating a hair-raising tale that seems to be politically tinged and personally  resonating in context. Instead of a lament of an unfaithful lover and her no good friend  who is creeping around in the Gordon song, Jerry turns a similar situation with a friend  he cant seem to turn his back on into a dark tale of betrayal and deceit. The guitars  grind along to heavy, dark and sometimes elusive drum rhythms that build into striking  vocal harmonies that remind you of how awesome this band was and now continues to  be. The overall theme of constant isolation and poor choices bleed through the lyrics  forming the crescendo of a chorus; A looking in View Too Long On The Outside/  Desperate Plans Make Sense in A Low Life. It makes sense that this was the first track  released from the record (even though it was not the first single) because it really helps  to set the tone and the mood for the story the band is trying to tell throughout.    When The Sun Rose Again: This is the perfect track to climb on your roof and listen to  as you watch the sunrise after an long night of soul searching and debauchery. The ruff  jangle of acoustic guitars makes the track feel nostalgic yet it also seemsto be a new  direction for the band. It has a bit of a Pink Floyd type of a feeling to it, more like Dark  Side of The Moon than the later stuff. The foreboding chorus nearly lifts itself out of the  darkness in time to feel the warmth of the sun but the song ends before the chill can  leave your bones.    Acid Bubble: Another MONSTER track on the album, has a \\"Angry Chair\\" vibe to it but  is much more deliberate lyrically than much of the bands previous work. Once again we  find Jerry so eloquently creating socio-political themes as effortlessly as he and others  did in the early 90s. It is a dark tale of mystery and revelation that builds into a stopstart  chorus that sounds like an industrial power drill boring a hole into the upper-crust  of society as Jerry repeats over and over, Intent Obsolescence/Built Into The System!    Lesson Learned: There really are no punches pulled on the album and this is another  track where the band really shows what it is made of. The guitars are bright and  powerful which at first is very disarming for a band known for its sludge rock. In an  instant you know where the train is headed as those familiar harmonies croon out  uneasy feelings of contempt and pain. It is however a song of extreme optimism with a  chorus that sounds like the gold they struck in the 90s with Layne at the helm. Its the  kind of track you cant wait to hear echoing off of the walls of any venue as they embark  on a new tour in the upcoming months. It feels like finding a shinny new copper penny in  your house the day after it burns to the ground. You realize the irony but it still makes  you smile for some inexplicable reason.    Take Her Out: Another standout track with a seemingly double entendre for both  meaning and purpose. Jerry sings of a female who is elusive and yet somehow fiercely  loyal. It is highly possible that the \\"she\\" is in fact Alice, his muse and creation that he is  desperately trying to woe back into a vital and meaningful relationship. He knows she  was on the verge of leaving him, being lost forever with lines like; Here I am Again. I feel  Time is Dragging On/ Arent you tired of Me? Whinging Overdrawn. He treads lightly  reminding her of the time they have put in together and the sacrifices they have suffered  through. He thinks sometimes it is no longer worth it, that the loss and pain are too  much for there to be anything left between them. In a Bodiless Embrace, Thriving I have  Grown/ Fickle Changing Grip Replaced, Choking Take it All, he muses at her seeing if  she will reveal her true feelings to him. He knows he isn't the only one who feels this  way about her pleading his case in the chorus; Faceless, Blind/ Want To Take Her Out  Again/ Shes Not Just Mine/ Want To Take Her Out Again. The ice is starting to melt and  things that were once familiar slowly start to become familiar once again. His hands are  back on the wheel and the knows the road ahead of him like the back of his hand. He  isnt going to let her go this time, he knows what he almost lost and what he has lost  and the battles he fought to get back to this place have led him here for a reason. He  turns coolly and says to her; Dedicated, True to Form/ Still The Only One/ Only  Guarantee, Continue After I am Done. He knows he is back and Alice is there with him,  riding shotgun the way he always intended for it to be before the fall nearly took her  away forever.    Private Hell: This is one of the best tracks on the album and I dare say one of the best  AIC songs ever written. The depth of the track is hard to describe in words without  sounding trite or callous. The music by itself sounds like a funeral dirge slowly grinding  its way down a street in the rain at dusk until it disappears over a hill in the distance  and takes with it the last remaining light of the day. Jerry more than hits his stride with  lyrics that seem to be pulled from somewhere so deep inside his person that he feels  uncomfortable even letting them escape past his lips. There is something about the  song that I cant put my finger on, it seems a puzzle at times with a loose, effortless  structure that builds continuously but never overextends itself. Jerry and crew find ways  to blend addictive melodies over short quick hooks that are delivered like Biblical truths  from the book of Proverbs. William fills in under Jerrys wailing vocals giving the track a  kind of glowing warmth that lifts it out of despair and into the heavens in a fashion  similar to that which only Layne could do in the past. Perhaps this is but a small glimmer  of the bands plans for the future! This is the kind of song that would even make old  music industry blow-hards stop in their tracks and listen with newfound amazement,  realizing that the genre that they helped create is been taken to previously undiscovered  heights. Clocking in at over five minutes in length the track breezes by and feels far too  short as the last notes echo off into eternity.    Black Gives Way To Blue: The masterpiece of the album comes at its end. The track much like the life of Layne Stayley, comes on like a lucid dream and is over far too soon. Jerry delivers the lyrics the same way he lived them, with honesty, pain and complete surrender. He stays true to his artistic vision never stooping beneath himself to sound needlessly sentimental. The chorus is a guiding beacon and the melody so haunting and memorable that it follows you around for days on end. Sir Elton John delivers a very tasteful piano track that plays seamlessly along with the band giving it a haunting, timeless quality.
0385737947|5.0|It's been a while since a story grabbed me and pulled so hard I could hardly stop reading, (at work on breaks, at lunch, and into the night) but I think the last one was Dean Koontz's book, Intensity. Initially, Maze Runner appealed to me because as a teenager I loved to run and loved the video game Pac-Man. So for me, the hook was that the question for the story seemed to be: what if you suddenly woke up in a video-game world like Pac-Man? While the real world that you came from continued to exist elsewhere, you had somehow dropped into this newly created and crueler world and had to run through a maze avoiding ghosts and goblins. How does the place exist, what are its functions and parameters, and how did it come to be? Who decides what rules exist, when they're bent or broken and what the consequences are? What would that world be like to live in? And maybe most importantly, how did you get there; are you being punished, and what's your purpose or contribution supposed to be?  I can't say if that's what the author intended but it was my initial reaction to the story.     Thomas wakes up in a strange world, knowing in general how to function and that there is a real world somewhere but without any memories of how he learned anything or anyone who may have been important to him. This new world is limited in size and split into two sections. The first is The Glade; a semi-normal and mostly safe living zone with its own eco-system including a farm for animals and growing vegetables, as well as open areas and a forest, with a layout that remains constant. The second section is The Maze; a maze of high ivy covered walls creating lanes and passages whose configuration changes every night. The Grievers, ugly vicious monsters who mostly roam around at night, also inhabit the Maze. The Grievers are unable to enter the Glade because the walls that separate the glade from the Maze close each night, locking the areas off from each other.     By the time Thomas arrives, already more than forty boys have been there for varying lengths of time. The \\"Gladers\\" as they call themselves, have set up their own society within their world. Everybody has assigned jobs based on their abilities and daily schedules followed. They have their own Rules, consequences for rule-breaking are decided on and carried out by the 12 \\"Keepers\\" after a \\"Gathering.\\" Thomas has to find his place among these people in this world, amid some suspicion and in some cases strong dislike by some Gladers. Even the ones that don't hate him feel he's something of a bad omen, which only increases when the first ever girl arrives in the maze the day after he gets there. Even after learning the difficulties and dangers, Thomas knows he wants to be a Maze Runner. However, he still has to prove himself first, and time is already running out on this new world even as he gets there. The stakes are already high, but the ante just keeps going up relentlessly as the story progresses through various showdowns, each revealing more clues to the Maze's secrets.    In the end, this wasn't so much a puzzle-solving story as it was about maintaining order, decency and courage in the face of inhumanity and hopelessness. Even though it's geared to be a bit juvenile and male-oriented, I can see this story having a broad range of appeal to many different readers, with the kind of message that's good to get across to people in general. I was glad to see the author planned two more books for this series, but I will also be looking to read his other books in the meantime.
1401207529|2.0|I bought this book for two reasons. Firstly, it's because I've always been a big Batman fan. Secondly, I was greatly influenced by a lot of the reviews out there, in particular, IGN's `25 greatest Batman graphic novels' list, which I think could do with a serious reshuffling.    The storyline of Batman: Year One, I felt, was pretty mediocre. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.     For those who don't already know, Batman: Year One tells of the challenges that face Jim Gordon as he climbs up the ranks of the crooked Gotham City Police Department; and Bruce Wayne as he returns from years of training and takes up the role of a vigilante to clean up the streets, and how their lives become intertwined with each other's.    The storyline takes place throughout the course of one year (hence the title). Though I'll admit that it had its good moments, the storyline felt disjointed and confusing in most parts.    The biggest letdown, I felt, was the artwork, and this just ruined the whole book for me. Not sure if it was intentional, but the graphics seemed very amateurish and sloppy.     For instance, from start to end, I couldn't tell if Catwoman was black or white (in terms of ethnicity). She looked brown / tan for most parts. Her hair was short but I couldn't tell if it was afro or just plain short.    Sure, it doesn't matter what her ethnicity is, but the fact that you can't tell from just looking at her shows that the artwork has issues. The same problem applied to other characters as well.    In my humble opinion, I feel that this book has been seriously overrated, and did not deserve the No. 1 spot on IGN's list. To me, it's the artwork that really makes a graphic novel (hence the term GRAPHIC novel), even if the storyline's crap.    Still, many have high regard for this book and if you're a big Batman fan, than get it for your own personal collection. If you're just into comics and want to know what the buzz is about, rent it or borrow it from a friend first.Sure, this book's a classic, but there are a lot of other Batman graphic novels that are classier, in my opinion.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I don't need to review Blade Runner.  If you are a fan, you know why this film is such a classic.  My husband and I have owned, and watched/rewatched, most of the releases.  The audio has always kept up with the times.  However, the film transfer quality has not.  The Laser Disc was the best transfer, but when the technology became obsolete we decided to move on.  The first (and only for many, many years) DVD release was the worst.  We had moved on, but Blade Runner was not enjoyable to watch anymore.  Then, after years of waiting, came Blu-ray.  Finally, a film transfer that is all that an ardent fan can ask.  If you want the cleanest, sharpest picture yet, this is the disc to own.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I didn't know much about Radiohead.  I had heard great things about them but never heard anything they had released.  But I sought out the videos, listened to the samples on Amazon and finally decided to take the plunge.  I've heard all of their CDs now and I do believe this is my favorite.  Not only that, but this is one of the greatest CDs of all time.    Every song is has something to marvel at.  It's different that it doesn't sound like they're repeating themselves but similar enough to make for a full album, one that can be enjoyed song by song or for the entire album.  It's good.    My favorites include the first, Airbag, Let Down, Electioneering, Climbing Up the Walls, No Surprises and The Tourist but they're all great.  It's quite an achievement.  Slower and more melodic than most music, but still enough rock to keep even the hardest of individuals amused.    Other songs I like include Paranoid Android, Exit Music (For A Film), Karma Police, Fitter Happier (the computer voice gives the album the perfect midpoint), and Lucky.  My least favorite (the only one I haven't mentioned): Subterranean Homesick Alien.    Must Buy.
0385504225|2.0|I thought the book was entertaining, although predictable.  Until I reached the end, that is.  The end was a real let down for me.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if there were some secret treasure at the end.  The climax of the book did not fit the rest of the action leading up to it.  I was dissapointed.
B00004XONN|5.0|Another great album from a fantastic band.  Radiohead stormed on the scene with their highly impressive debut [[ASIN:B000002UR7 Pablo Honey]] and continued with classics [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] and [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]].  Now comes this animal.  Another classic in the veins of the first two.    Kid A begins nicely where OK Computer left off.  Not to say that this is a continuation of that album.  This is something entirely different.  Everything In Its Right Place does feel like it could've fit on OK Computer, but, after giving this entire album a listen, it more properly fits on this one.  It gives way to the title track.  The experimentation on this alone is worth a listen.    Reminding me of some of the techniques used on OK Computer, this is another standout track with a great melody that draws you in.  Even if you can't understand what Thom's saying, the melody will have you hooked.  Followed by The National Anthem and How to Disappear Completely, the CD starts on a high note.    The next song, an instrumental Treefingers, is a nice break, but I'm not too fond of it.  The rest of the tracks are good as well, with a few I really like (In Limbo and Idioteque) and a few I don't (Motion Picture Soundtrack).  In reality, there's not a bad song on the CD.    I give this my highest recommedation.  Must Buy.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Robin Williams said, \\"Anyone who remembers the 60s wasn't really there.\\"  For the rest of us, we have Mad Men - a must-see for Baby Boomers.    This series draws you in from the opening titles, introduces you to Don Draper (an advertizing man with a mysterious past), and you're hooked as the story unfolds.    Smart writing, authentic set designs, nostalgic music, and a terrific cast compel you to come back for more.  Every episode will keep the viewer satisfied like a fresh pack of cigarettes.    The DVD set is loaded with extras and commentaries - 2 per episode!    Buy it and enjoy!
0385341008|5.0|I don't believe I've laughed and cried as much in the same book _ever_.  What an astounding book.  There is so much between the covers of this book that I'm amazed it's not 1,000 pages. There's history, drama, romance, tragedy, hope and resilience all packaged neatly in a relatively small book. I rented it on CD and actually stopped listening for a week before I got to the end because I simply didn't want it to end.  The characters are so real, you feel as if you know them--and you cry for them, and cheer for them just like you would your real friends.  The plucky heroine, Juliet, is a charmer and sure to win your heart as she did mine.  After I returned the CD, I bought the book in hardback so I can go back and read it again and again.  It really is that good.  I normally don't wish for a movie or sequel, but for The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie society, I'm wishing for both just so I can visit these wonderful characters again on their little island in the English Channel.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Just great the arrangement is nice and the 2 new songs are really good. It is missing some key songs but as with most greatest hits CDs they always leave off some good nuggets to ensure you will buy the next greatest hits CD that will have them but in general this really has most of the key hits.    The DVD has most of the songs that are missing but still is missing some really good nuggets.    Over all if you are a big fan or just a fan you will love it.
B00005LB50|5.0|Simply put, this is an extremely listenable box set. I am not going to quibble with the lack of the 10-minute (or is it 11??) version of Bluebird. Or the lack of live material: I''ve heard lots of rough tapes of BS live and though they are excellent, the quality is very poor. The HDCD mastering by Neil Young's team (John Nowland-Redwood Digital) is plainly and simply the best Springfield you'll ever hear. There are plenty of demos from the writers (Stills, Furay and Young) and I think each is given his fair share of space on the box. There are many different versions of songs and some hidden unreleased gems. But, as one other reviewer said to all the complainers: It's the listenability of these discs and the way they flow that gives the box set it's value. And no, I am not biased toward Neil Young...I will not buy his archives. Yes, there is some repetition here...but it's really not a flaw, just a way of grouping and listening. Too bad this box is out of print...worth looking around and buying used!
0743497465|1.0|Though I had written  a good review regarding delivery of the mentioned book upon reading same I found about 6 or 8 pages that had printing defects that made it impossible to read a praragraph or two on each of these pages. I consider that a book in those conditions should not even be offered for sale as it is defective. If I remember correctly it was offered as used as new.<br />I thank you for the opportunity to record my opinion.<br />Sincerely<br />Ricardo Cleaver
B001EN71DQ|5.0|I hadn't seen these movies since they came out and then decided I wanted to watch all six of them (including the older ones) marathon style.  They're very different from the second half of the set, but offer a lot of background information.  Episode III is my favorite! (And super quick delivery time let me have my marathon the very next weekend!)
0451169514|5.0|Another winner from Stephen King.  His books are always engaging, and they age well.  This one was written 25 years ago, but has only an occasional line here and there that sounds dated. At the end of his books, we usually get a small slice of redemptive theology. I thought King handled this slice better in other books, such as Needful Things and Salem's Lot. But these are minor points about a book with so many strong points.  And, yes, there was one evening that I had a rare nightmare, caused by this book.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved the movie. I read the books years ago and loved them. My Two Towers broke, probably worn out. I got another one and it's great. I'm glad they had it, because they are not in stores any more.
B00005K9QP|5.0|The ultimate testament to the power of the British blues! A beautiful all time classic, with the sizzling Les Paul through a Marshall combo work of Eric Clapton. It is easy to see how he earned the nickname god around this time.An emotional, lyrical masterpiece and a wonderful effort by all involved. May be the best of John Mayall's many great bands. A treasure trove of guitar gold and blues classics!
B001F1YBPI|5.0|I must confess, I ordered this DVD to check out the filming techniques of video director Andreas Morell, who received some badmouthing for his cropped takes and \\"rapid-fire\\" editing of the Caravaggio ballet. And just last week I told a friendly music customer that I really didn't care very much for the Brandenburgs.<br /><br />So it was with some apprehension that I began playback of this Orchestra Mozart disc. In the second minute, I cringed and said to my Split Personality (S.P), \\"Oh dear, the six cameras must be strapped to the heads of hummingbirds darting about.\\" S.P. chimed in, \\"And just listen to hairy Bach's rapid-fire counterpoint! It's screwing my internal oscillator. Gimme a cig.\\" We made it through the 100 minutes and I thought, \\"It's unlikely I'll ever watch this again.\\"<br /><br />But as I slept the Blue Fairy glowed into my 1 1/2, touched each of my ears with her magic baton and said but softly, \\"Fantasia.\\" The next day I pressed the Start button again and watched and listened. All was a joy! Twenty-nine down to earth musicians in familial synchronicity, coaxed so kindly by Grandpa Abbado, raining Bach's blessings on the summer meadows, woods, and villages of baroque Germany, France, and Italy. On all the nice people in the neo-classic Teatro Municipale di Reggio. On me, the repentant.<br /><br />At the concert conclusion, the upper tiers shower the stage with yellow and white flowers, and roses with ribbon streamers. The musicians retrieve some of them, tucking one into the jacket pocket, the hair, even the trumpet mouthpiece. May I have some for Andreas Morell and his film crew? In my second viewing, not a shot, not a splice jagged me. Those guys caught the intense concentration of the music dedicatees, their un-self-conscious facial expressions and body language, their glances and smiles at each other. Here's a second hand rose, Andreas, for your mom's scrapbook.
B000T05R8Q|5.0|Incredible package of the first Pink Floyd album plus the singles and out takes! A must for any collector or fan of Syd Barret's Pink Floyd. A classic in every sense of the word! Syd's beautiful writing and fantastic underrated guitar playing, along with an amazing peek into the British psychedelic scene from one of it's most prolific bands. A must have!
B000DN5W4I|5.0|I've been lucky enough to see Joe B several times here in northern Virginia.  The venues have been small where Joe has a real connection to the audience.  I do hope he still can play the smaller places but after the new Royal Albert Hall DVD he probably won't be able to play the smaller clubs anymore.  Such a shame he and his group are such likeable guys and do take the time to talk and sign autographs after their shows.      Buy this and all Joe's CDs and DVDs.  This guy is the greatest thing to happen to the electric guitar since Jimi Hendrix.  You will not believe how well this guy can play.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is a favorite series and a must have for our collection.  Action packed, you won't be disappointed if your a biker.
1416550542|5.0|I hope they make a movie from this someday. I truly hope they do.    Imagine 'The Secret Garden', 'The Thirteenth Tale' and 'Annie' coming together to make one novel: a story of loss, obsession, risks, love and redemption. Morton does it, astonishingly well, with The Forgotten Garden. This may be my favorite book - in this genre - off all time. Lengthy? Yes. A bit hard to keep stories/people from tangling in your head as you read? Yes. But it all fits beautifully in the end, spelling out lives and characters you won't ever forget.    At least I won't. I hope they make this into a movie one day.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I held off completing and submitting this review until I had ample opportunity to listen to each of the newly re-mastered Beatles CDs, both in Mono and in Stereo, as well as to revisit many of the original 1987 Beatles CDs.  I have now done so.  Although I own many of the original LPs, I have not yet compared those.  All listening was done on an excellent, but not quite audiophile (but very close!), stereo system.          Like many of you reading this, I debated over which set - Mono or Stereo --- to purchase.  I ultimately purchased and received first pressings of both sets.  So what's the scoop?  Here is a comprehensive - but lengthy - analysis.      First, its all about the music -- really the best thing about these releases is that it reintroduces the wonderful music created by the Beatles into the popular culture.  Love them or hate them, it is undeniable: The Beatles were a unique musical phenomenon and wrote and performed some of the best and likely longest lasting music of the Twentieth Century.  In addition to the quality of the music, the Beatles were incredibly prolific: from 1962 through 1970 (a period of roughly seven years) they recorded an incredible twelve (12) UK albums, (albeit short albums by today's standards) plus Magical Mystery Tour and a couple of CDs worth of singles that did not appear on the UK albums (but which are collected on the Past Masters and Mono Masters collections, included in the new box sets).  Unlike most popular music of the last fifty years, the music of the Beatles will likely still be played not just throughout the Twenty-First Century, but also in the Twenty-Second.  The Beatles are the Beethoven of our lifetime.  Teenage children of women that I date currently have Beatles posters on their walls -- forty (40) years after the Beatles (collectively) last recorded a record.  That is amazing.  The continued popularity of the Beatles is evidenced by the fact that the first pressings of both the stereo box and the \\"limited edition\\" mono box of re-mastered CDs immediately sold out upon - or before -- release.           Second, chronologically listening through the entire Beatles catalogue gives one a sense of the development of the Beatles as a group and of the individual members.  It certainly has been a labor of love (albeit somewhat time consuming!)  The early Beatles, as a pure rock outfit, were clearly led by John Lennon, who sings lead on most of the early tracks.  As time went on, John became the most experimental of the four in his songwriting and in the studio, and Paul emerged as the primary hit maker in the band, and, over time, composed more of the band's material than he had in the early years.             Third, the 1987 Beatles CDs have been unfairly maligned in the reviews on this site and elsewhere.  I have re-listened to quite a few of them and - as stand-alone CDs -- they sound just fine.  The problem with those CDs is that - like most CDs of that era -- they are a bit shrill on the high end, and lack the warmth of analogue LPs.  Moreover, they do not offer the clarity, detail and bass response offered by the new re-masters.  Having said that, if your purpose is to listen to this music in MP3 format, through ear buds, or through tiny speakers, the old CDs will serve you just fine.       Fourth, the new CDs offer sound that runs the gamut from just a marginal improvement (some of the tracks on the earlier albums) to a dramatic improvement (especially for the later albums, starting with Revolver) over the older CDs.  OVERALL, the new CDs, both mono and stereo, offer much greater clarity and detail than do the old CDs, and the sound is warmer (especially the mono CDs) than the old CDs.  Moreover, the new CDs have greater bass response (especially the stereo CDs).  Overall, the deeper (chronologically later) into the catalogue that you go, the greater the sonic improvements.  The vocals, Paul McCartney's terrific bass lines and Ringo Starr's steady drums - on most of the songs -- are now oh so clear.  You will (especially on some of the mono tracks) hear or notice things you never heard or noticed before.  The sound quality of these CDs is not, however, quite at the level of the SACD releases offered for Bob Dylan, the Moody Blues and the Rolling Stones, respectively.  In particular, SOME of the tracks on the mono CDs lack definition, particularly in the midrange.  These are, however, much improved CDs that are incredibly faithful to the original music.  Here, the engineers - commendably -- did not succumb to the \\"loudness war\\" so prevalent in CD re-mastering since the advent of the IPOD.  With respect to the mono set, there has reportedly been no compression whatsoever.  The CDs are actually lower in volume than the 1987 discs.  They have a warmer sound that one associates with LPs.  With respect to the stereo CDs, there has reportedly been only minimal compression added, and the fine sound reflects that.  Only Abbey Road struck me as being somewhat louder.  Lastly, the CDs have not been remixed.  Although the remixed 1999 Yellow Submarine CD (which I have not heard) and the remixed 2006 Love CD (which I have heard and is fantastic) have been well received, I think that the fact that these new CDs were not remixed is a good thing, as what we getting here are better sounding versions of the original releases, not new (changed) versions of the music (although the mono versions will be a revelation to many).  To me, remixing classic music has been hit or miss.  I love the remixes of the Doors CDs, but am less than pleased with the remixes of the Genesis CDs, which, in addition to being remixed, are overly compressed.  That is not the case here.                     Fifth, with respect to the present mono v. stereo debate, I would suggest that a purchase of either set, or any of the individual CDs, would be satisfying.  The preferred version depends on the song and/or the CD in question, as well the listener's tastes.  If I HAD to chooseone box set, it would be the mono.  The mono CDs are better packaged (see below), are warmer sounding, in some cases offer unique mixes and are more engaging.  Having said that, to my ears, OVERALL the stereo CDs do SOUND better than the mono CDs.  They offer greater clarity and are brighter, without being overly harsh the way the older CDs were.  That makes sense - the intent was to create a better sounding uniform Beatles catalog, and that is the stereo version.  Moreover, the stereo box set includes ALL of the Beatles original catalogue, including Yellow Submarine, Let it Be and IMO the Beatles' finest album, Abbey Road, each of which are not included in the mono box set, as they were not originally mixed in mono.  [Note: Yellow Submarine only contains four \\"new\\" Beatles songs, which are included in the mono set on the Mono Masters collection.]  Further, as of this writing, each stereo CD contains a video component, which are collected on a separate DVD included in the stereo package, concerning the making of each album.      Nevertheless, for many of the CDs or for specific songs, the mono versions are indeed superior.  To my ears, and this is consistent with other reviews listed here, of the ten Beatles albums included in the mono CD box set (not counting the Mono Masters collection), five are (overall) preferable to their stereo counterparts: Please Please Me, With The Beatles, Help, Rubber Soul and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  For me, the mono White Album also comes close.  As many reviewers have noted, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, and to a slightly lesser extent, Help and Rubber Soul, are all superior in mono, in large part because the mono versions do not have the left-right issue (all vocals on one channel and all instruments on the other channel) and the latter two CDs also offer the original stereo mix (George Martin remixed Help and Rubber Soul for the 1987 CD releases, and a re-mastering of each of those versions is what is includedon the new stereo CDs).  As many reviewers have correctly noted, the mono versions offer more punch than the stereo versions.  For the early albums especially, the sound is akin to a live rock performance.  Further, SOME of the mono versions are a revelation.   Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band -- which is incredible in its new stereo incarnation - is MINDBLOWING (and very different than the stereo version) in mono.  This one CD - which I had once thought was over-rated (silly me) -- practically justifies, in and of itself, the higher price of the mono set.  It is undoubtedly the crown jewel of the mono box set and if that box set does go out of print there will be - at a minimum -- tremendous demand for the release of the mono Sgt. Pepper's.  Further, the mono White Album, which had never before been released in the U.S., is so very different - and some of the tracks reveal so many different layers -- than the stereo version!  Here are some other examples.  For me, \\"Yesterday\\" (which appears on Help) in mono just sent chills down my spine.  I did not experience that in the stereo version.  Similarly \\"Nowhere Man\\" (which appears on Rubber Soul) is just stunning in mono.  On the other hand, to me, John's breathy \\"Girl\\" (also on Rubber Soul) sounds better in stereo, as, being on one channel, the distinctive vocals are clearer, and George Harrison's instrumental break (with a call and response guitar line) is more engaging.  As aforesaid, in many cases it simply depends on the particular album or song, and the listener's tastes.      Sixth, the packaging for both the mono CD box and the stereo CD box is gorgeous.  As is well known, the re-mastered mono CDs are not (currently) available individually and are only offered in the purportedly \\"limited edition\\" box manufactured in Japan, which has a stellar reputation for production of outstanding sounding CDs with packaging that is faithful to the original LPs.  (The packaging for this set reminds me of the recently released and excellent Led Zeppelin Japanese made box, which I also reviewed here).  The box itself, which will fit nicely on most CD racks, is constructed of a hard cardboard material and is coated with a white sort of laminate, with very simple and tasteful title graphics and the familiar green apple.  Each individual CD package and CD is an exact replica of the original UK mono LP release (except for Magical Mystery Tour, which is a replica of the US mono release), down to including all of the original inserts.  Like all Japanese made CDs, each album is housed in a re-sealable cellophane envelope (there is no OBI strip, however).  As advertised, this set was clearly designed with the collector in mind.  The stereo box is made here in the USA.  It is larger than the mono box (about the size of a shoe box, similar to the two Grateful Dead box sets of their [mostly] studio albums).  Like the mono box, the stereo box has a sort of laminate, this time in black, with tasteful graphics and the familiar green apple.  The box closes with a hidden magnet, like, for those who are familiar with it, the Phish box set Hampton Comes Alive.  The box itself is housed in a (temporary?) cardboard sleeve.  Each individual CD is housed in a digipak which contains a nice booklet, printed on glossy paper stock, which contains the original liner notes (if any) of the album along with recording notes and very nice pictures of the fab four.  The White Album is nicely housed in a slip case with the embossed: \\"The Beatles.\\"  As other reviewers have noted, the stereo CD digipaks house the CDs in a slip with no protective sleeve.  Why didn't designers of the packaging include a CD holder, like the Bob Dylan re-masters?  Nevertheless, the cardboard stock of the digipak is study enough so that the package can be propped open (without damaging the packaging) to permit safe removal of the CD, although you may have to touch the edge of the CD to do so (possibly leaving fingerprints).  I suspect thatthe digipaks will soon be history and will be replaced with more conventional (and horrid) jewel boxes, which would at least more safely store the CDs.  (Collectors note: the original pressing of the Magical Mystery Tour stereo CD label has a misprint re: the Let It Be documentary video being on the disc.  That misprint is reportedly being corrected for future pressings of the CD).     Lastly, a word about the pricing.  The box sets ARE expensive.  In spite of this, demand has clearly - for now - exceeded supply.  All box sets tend to be expensive, and with respect to Japanese made mini-LPs, these are often very expensive.  The \\"Japanese\\" mono box, which likely contains the very same CDs as the Japanese made CDs contained in the \\"limited edition\\" mono box sold in the US, costs approximately, or more than, twice as much.  If money is an issue, you can avoid the box sets and focus on the following (listed chronologically): Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt. Peppers, The Beatles (the \\"White Album\\") and Abbey Road, each of which is amongst the very best rock albums ever made, and the very fine stereo re-master of each is readily available at a reasonable price.  If you want to experience the early Beatles, the 1987 CDs of the Beatles first four UK albums, Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Day's Night and Beatles For Sale, all in mono, are likely [for now] still available.  You can add the new stereo versions of Help, Past Masters, Magical Mystery Tour, Let It Be [or even better, Let It Be . . .  Naked] and Yellow Submarine, in that order, as funds allow.                      So what's my recommendation?  That depends on who you are (and what your budget is).  If money is an issue, see the previous paragraph.  If you already own any or all of the 1987 CDs, and plan on only listening on ear buds or a less than high quality system, save your money and stick with those, and supplement your collection as necessary with the individually available stereo CDs.  If you want the absolute BEST possible sound now available on CD, overall the stereo CDs are the way to go, and they are and will be readily available (although the first pressing of the box set is currently sold out, the second pressing is available by pre-order).  If you want to experience the Beatles as it is reported that they originally intended, if you want to hear different mixes (often revelatory and in many cases superior), if you are a completest and/or if you want collectable facsimiles of the original UK LPs, pick up the \\"limited\\" mono box set., which, at the time of this writing, is once again available by pre-order (for the second pressing).  As aforesaid -- and this is a personal choice -- if I had to choose just ONE set, I'd go with the mono set, and I would supplement it with the new stereo Abbey Road and the previously released Let It Be . . . Naked.  Whether the mono re-mastered box will be available beyond the purported \\"second pressing\\" is, at the time of this writing, unknown and the subject of much speculation.  If, however, the mono box is history, then the stereo re-masters are terrific.     Happy listening!

B002JM1VJG|5.0|I pre-ordered this dvd and I still have to get my copy from Amazon but I bought the Philippine version just this past weekend. It has the same tracklist and it contains a fold-out poster (similar to that of the cd) and notes at the back on who produced and directed each video. Admittedly, I was sort of influenced and disappointed by some bad reviews over the alleged sub-standard picture quality so I was prepared for anything. But when I first saw it, I loved the packaging (it was not placed in the standard dvd container but in a cd-type package). I went home and braced myself for a video experience which could either be great or lousy. I put the dvd in my Sony player (which I connnected to my Sony amplifier for great sound) and watched it on my Sony TV. Lo and behold! The experience was a wonderful and nostalgic trip down memory lane. As I was viewing each video, I was reliving my life for the past 25 years and realized that Madonna was there during each phase of my life because she had such a great and lasting impact on me through her wonderful music - starting in the 80s when I was a naive college student up to now in the 00s when I am working in the corporate world. As I said in my review of the cd, Madonna has artistically and musically evolved through the years. The chronological sequence (which I hoped they had done with the cd) in this dvd was perfect because it showed the changes in Madonna (her looks, video concepts, types of music) through the 25 years of her sterling career as an artist. From \\"Burning Up\\" which starts the video experience all the way to her most recent video \\"Celebration\\" which ends the double dvd - boy it was such a magnificent audio-visual experience! Madonna was so different yet beautiful in all her videos. Her chameleon-like changes in each video was really a lesson in brilliant reinvention - one of the reasons for her career longevity. She truly deserves the honor of being named MTV's Artist of the Millenium. The picture and sound quality were perfect (at least viewing it with my Sony equipment) so I don't know what all that pixellation and smearing fuss was all about. For all the readers, please get a copy of this double dvd because it is the definitive Madonna compilation. With 47 videos, this is indeed a must-own because it is one great video after another. I don't see why there are others who choose to be so negative. Who cares if \\"Justify\\" was censored? You can always play the uncensored version from your collection. However, I had hoped they made it 50 videos for this compilation (at 25 videos per disc) and included \\"This Used to be My Playground,\\" \\"Nothing Really Matters,\\" \\"Fever,\\" or \\"Bad Girl.\\" The last 3 are among her best. For all the fans, please go out and support Madonna because she is our Queen of Pop. Other artists sound and look irritatingly the same which makes them boring and redundant but not our Madonna who always sees change as a step forward and in the right direction. I am disappointed that American radio has not played \\"Celebration\\" which is a great and positive song nor her past few singles which is the reason they have not done well in the Billboard Hot 100 (Hung Up was no. 1 in 47 countries EXCEPT the US!). I hope that \\"Revolver\\" gets better treatment because it has a different vibe compared to other Madonna songs. Madonna is a great American artist and a pop icon so I am wondering (more of in extreme bewilderment) why she is not being given anymore the massive support she previously enjoyed and so rightfully deserves in her mother country. I must give the wonderful British people so much commendation because they simply love Madonna and have, in fact, made Madonna their Queen with 13 no. 1 songs and 11 no. 1 albums (Celebration was her 11th No. 1 album in the UK). Noteworthy, their King also happens to be American - Elvis Presley. Surprisingly, other artists who are big in America are only big in America and are not given much attention in Britain or outside America. Madonna is the true GLOBAL SUPERSTAR because she is loved everywhere from Asia to Europe. Her music is universal and appeals to everyone regardless of age, color or gender. Cheers to Madonna! Here's to the next chapter of your illustrious music career inspiring people with your brand of great pop music. I must also mention that Madonna's control of her personal life is inspiring to her fans and worth emulating - no drugs, no alcohol, no breakdowns, no scandals. All the best to Her Madgesty :-)
0316017922|4.0|Okay, so some people took this book very seriously (engineering-types!).  This was such a fun book.  I had it read to me via down loadable media and it sure made my housework go a lot quicker.  There were a lot of \\"a-haa\\" moments and I particularly enjoyed the part about the computer geeks (Gates and Joy) during the early days of timesharing as it brought back many memories of my college days in the computer lab as well as my early career days in the computer industry.   I think there's a little bit for everyone in this book and my boys, 11 and 8, enjoyed some of the stories I shared with them.  I definitely recommend this.
B002C6K7NU|4.0|Here is a band that has seen and done it all. From tragedy to numerous line up changes they stiil maintain originality. They do things their way and make damn good music. Better than 99% of bands today. Classic Skynyrd.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I previously owned this anime on dvd and really enjoyed it a lot. Now that I own it on blu-ray and with the extended scenes, I feel as though I'm watching a whole new movie with a different experience!! I enjoyed every bit of it and it was worth the wait.
B00151HZME|3.0|To be honest, this album was my first exposure to M83, specifically \\"skin of the night\\". After hearing this gorgeous, refreshing tune I had to check this band out. Did the rest of the album live up to it's potential? Well, sorta. The second half kinda drags but I LOVE the first 7 or so songs. They have a strangely satisfying neo-eighties vibe, and I hear the influence of artists like Tears For Fears, The Cure, Depeche Mode, just about anything from the era that wasn't hair metal. But there's also a modern feel that permeates throughout so I guess you could best describe this album as the sound of a lost decade that happened between the eighties and nineties. The weird \\"breakfast club meets fashion show\\" photography says more about \\"Saturdays=Youth\\" than words ever could. If only the last few tunes were as magical as the rest...
B0024FAR5M|5.0|An absolutely brilliant show. There are so many ordinary shows being made at present that not only is it refreshing but fantastic that a show like this can and has been made. Kurt Sutter is a genius.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I love Alice in Chains and when I heard they put out a new album I was like \\"yea... this will be good\\". But it is! It is great. Omigod I am loving this album so much... classic. Good stuff.
B0024F08UG|4.0|Produced before the fall of the twin towers, this film depicted the concerns of everyone who has ever gone into a skyscraper.  What would happen if it ever caught fire and I was up here.  Extremely well done for its time, it still must be the measure for every disaster movie since.  With three film stalwarts including Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and William Holden turning in fine performances and very good pre digitized special effects, this movie is still top notch entertainment, especially in the Blu Ray format.

1601251505|5.0|When the \\"Toy Company\\" decided to remake D&D and the ancient Forgotten Realms into their image I moved.  I've played FR and D&D for over 25 years.  We've been playing Pazio since D&D 4e came out.  We have used our classic 3.5 books so were looking for a nice update.  This book did that.  Overall I will rate it VERY nice.  Well constructed, and this is important as Pazio had issues with construction issues of their paper back modules.<br /><br />I question their decision to publish this in one book.  Man it is big and my gaming group does lug this to the table.  Every one has multiple books, so I guess that is what they thought about, if you are already taking two books, why not take one.<br /><br />Another thing that I don't like is they re-used a lot of graphics from their previous work.  I don't know I like the graphics, and I've played in their world for about a year, so I noticed.  The back of the book shows a Gray Maiden from the module we are playing now.  Now in their favor, they are a small company and most of these pictures were in the DM's module so they are new to players and others, but hey $50, get new art.<br /><br />Another thing on the art I liked were the description on what was going on.  Especially when they have people casting spells and a picture, and I am looking at the photo thinking what the heck is happening here?  I like the pictures that have \\"Reg the mighty Wizard blast his foes with Magic Missiles.\\"  Small issue, but like I said, I love the book so I am just nit picking.<br /><br />Another thing my local Game Store mentioned is that they apparently didn't print enough.  My local gaming store purchased 40 and sold out, order an additional 10 (all they could get) and there was two on the shelf when I got there.  Good that people are supporting Pazio 3.5, maybe Pazio didn't know how hot of a product they had.<br /><br />I love what they did to Paladin.  He is now the Evil - destroying monster he should have always been.  No matter the evil, they are annoyed when the Paladin comes and \\"lays down the smite\\" on them.  Barbarian now is pretty cool too.<br /><br />All the rules are great, they are all well play tested as they are from ... the Community and not some 5 year old they had \\"re-do\\" the Realms.  Duh!  Again a message for the Toy Company \\"...do not fear your customers...\\"  The rules are well thought out, Pazio has put so much work in giving so much away for free on PDF's and play testing it to death, that it is obviously there are a lot of good ideas in the book, they are OUR ideas.<br /><br />Great work Pazio people.

B001P3SA94|5.0|I cannot remember the last time I saw a movie as fine as this. I'm sure it plays fast a loose with \\"the facts\\" as much as anyone alive knows the facts, but the story, the performances, the sound quality are so far beyond \\"good,\\" I can't even describe them in words. There were so many times I found myself trembling with excitement watching this movie, as though I was actually there seeing the original players perform these songs for the first time. I was privileged to see both Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf perform at Newport, Rhode Island in the 1960s, so this subject has been of great interest to me throughout my life. I was prepared, however, to expect very little from a group of rappers fooling with this great old music. It feels so good to be wrong when someone else does something this right. There's been plenty of talk about Beyonce Knowles' stunning performance as Etta James, and she does, indeed, bring tears to my heart in this role as both an actress and a singer. And Adrian Brody and Jeffrey Wright carry the film as Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters. But don't for one minute underestimate the staggering power of Eamonn Walker as Howlin' Wolf, Gabrielle Union as Geneva Wade, Columbus Short as Little Walter, and Mos Def as a spot-on Chuck Berry. If you love the blues and rock & roll, don't hesitate for one minute. This is the best dramatic movie about the blues or rock & roll to date. If you loved La Bamba, Cadillac Records will blow you out of the water. I've never been the least bit interested in following the career of Beyonce, but I'll tell you, she won a new fan tonight. I'm putting this sound track on my iPod tomorrow and I will check out her records. Now, if they'll just spin it off and let Eamonn Walker do a movie on the life of Howlin' Wolf, and Mos Def devote an entire film to Chuck Berry's life, I'll be delighted. I did miss one of my favorites, Bo Diddley, and wonder why he was left out. I guess they couldn't cover everyone. Perhaps he was left on the cutting room floor. If so, I hope they release a director's cut. Cadillac Records has joined the ranks of my very favorite movies.cutting room floor. If so, I hope they release a director's cut.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|The first I heard of Muse was in the Twilight soundtrack.  Then Adam Lambert singing Starlight at an AI concert, which I loved.  So I was prompted to buy this CD and I really love the sound.  A lot of interesting musical combinations - especially love the sound of the heavy piano chords in some of the songs, which I personally think goes very well with the alternative rock sound.  I like this CD better than their new release
B000001EEN|3.0|EC's well-publicized heroin addiction almost claimed his own life in the early 70's, and when he appeared at the Rainbow Theatre in North London, in January 1973, he hadn't overcome his dependence. This was the first time he had played live since 'The Concert For Bangladesh' in August 1971, and by his own admission he was rusty and lacked confidence.<br /><br /> His playing on this set never approaches the heights of the Dominoes 'Live At The Fillmore', (also released in the same year) and he doesn't take the extended solos that were to the fore on that album. However, there are flashes of inspiration on 'Let It Rain' and 'Key To The Highway'; and evidence of his fluid yet biting runs on 'Badge','Roll It Over' and 'Little Wing', but for the most part the phrasing is fractured and the tempo sags alarmingly on 'Bell Bottom Blues'. You can hear him slowly feeling his way back into performing live.<br /><br /> Clapton also sounds a little different from the Dominoes days; used a Gibson Les Paul for most of the gig, which he hadn't done since playing with John Lennon in Toronto in 1969. The band sounds tight, although the tempo sags alarmingly on 'Bell Bottom Blues'. ELsewhere, Ron Wood handles the slide parts competently but unexceptionally and Steve Winwood contributed somewhat modestly as part of the band.<br /><br />Of interest but not at his most fluent.

The dwarfs gave me some good laughs and I enjoyed the music, in spite of Snow White's rather high pitched voice and overdone vibrato.<br /><br />I think the Diamond Edition provides plenty of features and extras for those who want them, and for those who just want to watch the movie it's got great picture and sound. The design of the DVD case is visually appealing and I enjoyed the preview of The Princess and the Frog
B00004S35Z|5.0|This is one of Stevie's best musical offerings ever.  We sometimes forget about this one due to the fact that it came right in between the Masterpiece \\"Innervisions\\" & the Tour de Force \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\", it also was recorded and released right after his recovery from the horrible car accident that put him in a coma for several days and nearly ended his life.<br /><br />However, with all of that said, you find some of his best ballads & lyrical content on this album and 2 of his funkiest & grooving songs \\"Boogie on Reaggae Woman\\" & \\"Haven't Done Nothin'\\".  Stevie had a streak of 3 Album of The Year Awards in 4 years in the early to mid 1970's, Fulfillingness' First Finale was the second of the 3.<br /><br />This was now right in the middle of what was termed his \\"classical\\" period and he was on streak of creativity that was truly amazing.  I am most impressed by the ballads on this album as they are a canvas for Stevie to show off poetic & visionary skills.  \\"Smile Please\\", \\"Creepin\\", \\"Too Shy to Say\\" & \\"Bird of Beauty\\" are sheer poetic masterpieces and his vocal work on each is simply outstanding.<br /><br />The album also introduces us to some soon to be major players in pop & soul music, Minnie Ripperton & Denise Williams, and has the Jackson 5, amongst others, making an appearance on the jam \\"Haven't Done Nothing\\" which is a scorching tongue lashing of then President Nixon and the Congress for the miriad of injustices going on in the U.S. and their involvement in other injustices around the world.<br /><br />Stevie has always been a very strong and consistent activist for change and social responsibilty and went a step beyond all the other so called \\"social artists\\" of the day by actively participating in demonstrations and going before government officials to get his message across.  I've always admired him for not being afraid to stand up for what he believes is right and be counted as having an opinion.  This is one of the very things Bob Marley and the Wailers spoke about when discussing Stevie as for years he was also the biggest selling artist in the island nations too.<br /><br />My favorite song on the whole album and one of his best masterpieces of all time is the haunting \\"They Won't Go When I Go\\".  For those of you who watched the tribute to Michael Jackson as Staples Center in LA following his departure from us (R.I.P.), you saw Stevie perform this very song.  I love the raw truth he sings in this song, you can almost hear the pain in his soul as he penned this gem. It is a heart felt goodbye of sorts to a world full of lying, betrayal, deceit, greed and a plea to be with one's Creator in the sky.<br /><br />The song was co-written by Yvonne Wright, Syreeta's sister, and is one of several songs she and Stevie wrote over his classical period.  She, like her sister, was an extremely talented artist in her own right and the lyrics she lent to this song are absolutely spectacular and they move my heart each and every time I hear them.<br /><br />This album really shows the true musical genius of Stevie, singer, songwriter, composer, arranger, producer, instrumentalist, etc.  The man truly is the WHOLE PACKAGE!  Earth, Wind & Fire are my favorite band, but Stevie is my favorite solo artist and both are as close to musical perfection as we've seen.

B0021L8UXU|5.0|When Shaun of the Dead hit the cinemas, it rode high critical acclaim for making fun of George Romero's living dead series while simultaneously celebrating it.  Now, we have Zombieland, America's free-wheeling, cowboy-infused take on this genre and Tallahassee is definitely the Yank's answer to Britain's Shaun.<br /><br />This time, the focus is on the more recent zombies; that is the ones like in 28 Days/Weeks Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake.  Something happens which causes humans to turn into the flesh-feasting dead and all of America is now pretty much gone.  In its place, as our protagonist and narrator Columbus explains, is a world he dubs Zombieland.  Taking its cue from The Zombie Survival Guide, Columbus has a few set of rules that are hilarious placed on the screen whenever they pop up.  It's this kind of anecdotal zaniness that carries the humor forward.  While taking place mostly in one timeline, Zombieland also takes hilarious flashbacks to various points prior to the zombie infestation and during the beginning of it to prove points.  This little vignettes are often hilarious and do a great job of filling in the story.<br /><br />Columbus quickly meets Tallahassee (played by Woody Harelson in a truly inspired take) and they have an uneasy truce between the two.  Columbus wants to get home to...Columbus to hopefully have a tearful reunion with his family.  Tallahassee seemingly wants to locate the last Twinkies because, as he eloquently explains, contrary to popular belief, they do have an expiration date and there will be a time when another Twinkie won't exist.  They then meet up with two sisters, Wichita and Little Rock, and their severely dysfunctional family is complete.<br /><br />While Zombieland is definitely a movie involving zombies, it surprisingly has more in common with recent road trip movies, like Little Miss Sunshine.  There's trust issues, situational comedic moments and a variety of more dramatic turns as we get to learn more abouteach character and their back stories.  Director Ruben Fleischer infuses the story with a zany approach that is at least on par with Shaun of the Dead, except taken to pop-cultural extremes.  I haven't even mentioned the surprise cameo and I won't, other than to say that this character completely steals the movie and elicited the biggest laugh from our crowded movie theatre.<br /><br />Speaking of which, Zombieland is a film to see in the cinema, preferably in a packed theatre filled with people who want to have a good time.  It was the most raucous movie-watching experience I've had recently, with tons of laughter, screams, clapping and cheering to go around.  Surprising, hilarious and incredibly entertaining.<br /><br />Zombieland: the most feel-good movie released this year.
B001WCN23W|1.0|I have to agree with the other comments about the re-mastering here. I was quite surprised how hot it sounded. \\"Wild Horses\\" in particular, sounded like it was distorting at times. I checked my levels, and it wasn't my gear, so just out of curiousity, I opened the file in Logic to see what the waveform looked like. I knew without checking that it must have been a recent digital re-master, because it's hot as all hell, and clipping significantly on the choruses. Made me realise that for old 60s/70s music, I should really be looking for the 80s/90s cd versions I guess, or analogue. Really kind of sad, given that the 70s were so obsessed with recording quality, that all that love and care is being lost just for loudness, which you can get by turning up your amp or iPod anyway. Really don't get it... I thought the \\"loudness war\\" was limited to recent releases, quite saddened to see it's even being applied to re-masters of old music.<br /><br />Great music, possibly The Stones' best album, but this is not the version to buy.
B000TGJ80I|5.0|Hello    I've watched all three movies in SD and HD on the Dish. We have the newest title on BD and after reading the reviews of both BD and DVD version I decided to grab this in Blu-Ray. The reviews I've read both pro and casual pretty much sum up my thoughts, this is a very good transfer in both image and sound. Let me break it down into two groups....    Image and visual - With the \\"Underworld\\" series don't expect a dazzeling colorful display. Instead it's a world of darks and grey with a touch of gothic appeal. While for some that may not be such a good thing it does show a great deal of contrast involving blacks against skin tones. And this is where this movie shines above all others. It has a great blend with surprising detail in this contrast especially with Kate Beckinsale dressed in black leather, with pitch black hair and a pale skin face. But it's all thruout the movie from the buildings, stone, chains, the rainy weather; the whole Underworld experience really shows up well with it's black & grey theme.    Sound - I was really surprised how well the DD 5.1 track did on this. Most will say, \\"oh well it's a gun battle here and there and what do you expect\\". Well that's just it, there's allot more. It's basically everywhere from the rain falling, to metal locks turning, splashes of water while running thru it, chains clanging and so on. One particular scene involved one Vampire with two whips lashing out at a Werewolf coming at him. It was if the whips were snapping back & forth side-to-side. And yes there are gun battles and plenty of them. The low end gets about an average workout but this is not Saving Private Ryan. It would've been extra icing if there was a DTS track.    Overall I would grade this close to \\"Reference Quality\\" for showing off BD and Sound. The high level of contrast with blacks and skin detail makes this a BD Standout. Sound wise a excellent choice for those who enjoy action and want it loud. Highly Recommended

B002BE7JEI|4.0|Una gran imagen y sonido para una gran película. No hay muchos artificios en la misma y no se aprecia DNR aparentemente. Lleva incluído el castellano en la película y en la película incluída en el dvd que se adjunta, aunque este último sea Zona A exclusivamente y los extras no están subtitulados (esto me parece muy mal por parte de la distribuidora Warner).  Kathy Bates está inconmensurable, fantástica e irrepetible (por Dios, que nunca se le ocurra a ningún descerebrado hacer un remake de esta obra de arte...).  En resumen, compra obligada porque será aprovechar muy bien su dinero. El envío de amazon, aunque lento, bien protegido.
0634022296|5.0|This is far and away the most useful chord songbook for the intermediate acoustic guitarist. Like other reviewers, I have worn out the spine of my copy, and may need to purchase a new copy. I've also annotated notes against songs.    Why is this Beatles songbook book so useful?  1) If you know Beatles Songs, you can start playing many immediately (some are just 2-3 chords)  2) If you want your friends to sing-a-long, this book is perfect  3) Special chord shapes are shown and diagrammed right when used in song! No more looking up what a A7sus2 chord is  I found playing Beatles songs as a break-through to singing while I played acoustic guitar, the reason being I already knew rhythm of song, so just had to learn chord changes and strum patterns.    Since I purchased this book a few years ago, I've sine noticed a number of other \\"songbooks\\" with just tabs come out, so clearly this format works (as it does searching tabs on the internet). The only thing missing from this book is strumming patterns, but I've kept rating at 5 stars since frankly, guitar books I've purchased with strumming patterns are usually wrong/too simple. I hope someday soon all guitar tabs will include strumming patterns.

0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol, sadly, is a perfect example of a book written specifically to be turned into a movie--one that would more aptly star Bruce Willis than Tom Hanks, I might add.  While I'm sure the overabundance of explosions, hi-tech military equipment, and archetypal good guy/bad guy types exchanging uninspired, cliched dialogue will make the transformation from book to movie very simple, they don't make for a very good novel. The writing is only ever so-so and the seamless integration of plot, history, and theory that successfully powered Angels and Demons and The DaVinci code is gone.  Instead, the lengthy symbology explanations in The Lost Symbol are disruptive and often unnecessary, creating an unsettling and somewhat grating stop-start effect that constantly interrupts the story, slows the pace, and frustrates the reader.  Also missing is any cleverness or character development.  Although I was never fully able to determine if this book is just not as smart as some of Brown's previous endeavors or if his formulaic writing leaves an imprint so predictable that readers are easily able to tap into its patterns, I found myself breaking codes and picking up on plot twists several chapters before the book's hero Professor Langdon, which detracted quite a bit from the overall believability of the premise.  After three books, I also would like to see Langdon's character a bit more evolved. For someone so stuck on patterns and consistencies, he seems fairly blind to his own: gets summoned to famed historical location usually heavily populated by tourists, finds obscure clue in the midst of mayhem, meets spunky, intelligent woman who becomes side kick, gets chased from one famous landmark to the other in pursuit of answers he claims he doesn't know, realizes he does know the answers, uses answers to prevent super bad guy(s) (usually motivated somehow by religious misconceptions)from changing the world for the worse, everybody lives happily ever after...until the next book, in which the exact same plot ensues. I don't seek a drastic a change.  I just want Langdon to acknowledge that he's been in this pickle before, demonstrate that he's learned something from it, and, for crying out loud, be a whole lot more guarded and a lot less trusting after after so many close calls.  He always acts surprised at his own involvement and even more surprised at the epiphany that ultimately makes it all come together, allowing him to unveil the culprit. That works for the first novel, maybe even the second, but it's starting to seem like tired shtick by the third.  It's like like Clue meets Groundhog Day and at some point in The Lost Symbol--I predict around Chapter 60--readers will realize they've already read this story. It just had a different title.  From there, any sort of engagement in reading will almost certainly erode into a 200 page wait for the ending they already know is coming.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|The line of George Harrison's post-Beatles career followed a saucer-shaped arc. After the somewhat stifling confines of being the `third' songwriter for the world's most lauded group of musicians, he had a backlog of material that could have lasted for half a decade. Instead, he burst out of the gate like Secretariat on steroids, releasing a triple album that contained more original material than he wrote during his entire career with the Beatles. He earned the distinction of releasing the first `solo Beatle' #1 album (\\"All Things Must Pass\\") and #1 single (\\"My Sweet Lord\\"). While still at the absolute peak of his abilities, he organized the Concert for Bangla Desh in 1971, an event that still is considered one of the most artistically successful charity events of all time. Subsequently, it seemed as though Harrison had either lost interest in fame or consciously decided to fly under the radar. For the next decade or so, he released modestly successful albums that pleased his fans but shunned mass acceptance. It wasn't until John Lennon's murder in 1980 that Harrison seemed ready to reignite his music career, but a great deal of his energy also went toward his film production company, Handmade Films. The late 80's saw a full-blown career resurgence both as a solo artist and as a member of the Traveling Wilburys, but his private life and subsequent illness prevented him from re-embracing the limelight.<br /> A career like George Harrison's has certainly yielded enough material for a `best of' collection, but his various phases (and record labels) rendered any previous compendium of his songs incomplete. \\"Let It Roll: The Best of George Harrison\\" covers more ground than any other, and disguises the dual peaks of his career by mixing up the chronological order. Furthermore, there are no Beatles recordings here, but there are a few Beatles songs (live versions from the Bangla Desh performance). Also lacking are his contributions to the Traveling Wilburys, making this a distinctly solo effort. Despite a few gripes (where on earth is \\"Beware of Darkness\\", or \\"Ding Dong, Ding Dong\\"?), the song selection is excellent, if tightly constructed - a single disk `greatest hits' for a guy who kicked off his career with a classic triple album simply isn't enough. Nevertheless, it's a gas to hear the early `70s Phil Spector productions sitting side by side with the late `80s work of Jeff Lynne (Electric Light Orchestra and his bandmate in the Traveling Wilburys).<br />Maybe you're the type of Beatles fan who bought an album or two by Paul (with or without Wings) and a few by John, but never felt like coughing up the cash for George's triple album, before losing interest. Now, there's a collection that provides most highlights from his life after the Beatles. \\"Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison\\"  barely scratches the surface, but perhaps it will inspire you to finally dig deeper and discover the trove of genius that defined the life's work of \\"the Third Beatle.\\" A- Tom Ryaninctly solo effort.

0618918248|4.0|A worthwhile and entertaining read from an author with an incredible sense of logic and perception. THE GOD DELUSION is an excellent broadside against unenlightened superstition in the modern age -- and seems to be aimed squarely at an American audience where our elected leaders make no bones about their intention of incorporating their medieval worldviews into their political agendas.<br /><br />Most of the criticisms (usually by folks who haven't read the book) take Dawkins to task for ad hominem attacks while attacking him in the exact same manner. My one question to the nay-sayers: If Dawkins is such a lightweight, why bother to attack him at all? Surely his statements and prose should stand or fall on their own.<br /><br />Is Dawkins preaching to the choir? Maybe. Or just maybe a curious \\"believer\\" might stumble across this introduction to atheism 101 and see, for the first time, the possibilities of a world without the poison of religion. Maybe someday you'll join us...

B0021L8UXU|4.0|Zombieland is a zomedy/zom-com/whatever you want to call a zombie movie that's self-aware and makes fun of the genre actively. To be honest, the whole horror genre is predicated on movies that have fun scaring you and making you laugh at totally ridiculous situations, so a zombie comedy isn't really very far-fetched. It's also not very unique given the popularity of [[ASIN:B0006A9FKA Shaun of the Dead]]. Fortunately, it's not like Scary Movie where it's actively making fun of a prototypical zombie movie but rather it derives humor from existing in a world where, without logical explanation, a zombie outbreak has spun out of control and virtually everyone except for our group of survivors are zombies. Aside from that, the plot just follows the main character (Columbus, Ohio, is his name - the characters don't use real names to avoid getting attached) as he tries to head home to find his family, which he's largely been estranged from. Needless to say, hilarity and misadventures ensue along the way.<br /><br />I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. Shaun of the Dead was definitely good, but I didn't love it and didn't laugh as much as I thought I would. Conversely, Zombieland was full of situational humor and violence so ridiculous and gratuitous that it was hilarious. It had a very good visual style with superb special effects. I don't know if I've seen such detailed violence before. Part of the visual style is borrowed from [[ASIN:B000LXH0AE Stranger Than Fiction]] (which I love more each time I see it and looks great just on DVD) where you have information presented to you in an augmented reality design. The main character has rules for surviving the zombie apocalypse that appear in the movie as if they're as 3-dimensional as the actors in the appropriate scenes and are just the cherry on top of already funny scenes.<br /><br />I think the cast really works, overall. There's something seductive and sweet in a scary way about Emma Stone and it plays out perfectly here. Woody Harrelson really steals the show though and clearly has a lot of fun doing so. There's also a cameo so good that I'd urge you to not go to the iMDB page for the movie until after you've seen it. The cast is literally just 4 characters plus a cameo, and I found it really cool that they were able to do much with so few characters. There's no question that the plot has its issues and there are as many things that don't make sense as your average zombie movie, but you find yourself caring less about those as you have more and more fun with the movie. It has its scary parts, but they're few and far between and well-balanced with comedy, which I thought worked really well overall.<br /><br />If you can stomach a few scares, this movie is well worth the price of admission. Try to see it with a group though (or with a date) - it's just one of those movies that work better when you're with other people. I give it a B+ just because I can't in good faith give a B movie and A score, but I definitely highly recommend it. It's probably the most worthwhile movie in theaters right now (unless your theater has [[ASIN:B001OQCV3I Inglourious Basterds]], which is one of the best of the year and everyone needs to see it).Harrelson really steals the show though and clearly has a lot of fun doing so.

0385504225|5.0|I really enjoyed this fast paced intrigue. I'm fond of Dan Brown, I know it is quite trendy to criticise his work negatively and it sounds utterly stupid to me.<br />Ok the recipe is always the same but if you enjoy a cook, you also enjoy tasting the same cakes a few times with only a little new spice at a given time.<br />I understand why so many people despise Brown's writing, it is too infused with truths and carthesian people have a hard time deciphering the true from the tale, they suffer from a little deception, both meanings.<br />Well if you enjoyed the contents, both the tale and the truths, then you'll probably enjoy some of the source such as Dr Kelly's Book the Human Antenna.nks Dan for your books, at least I'm not dead bored in my bed all day long.
1400049628|5.0|A serious warning must be heeded before reading this book!  The reader must be sure (this is vital, no joking around here) to empy his or her bladder before reading this book.  While it's true that there are a great number of people who don't enjoy this type of humor (fools, all of them!), I am confident that they wouldn't buy the book, leaving copies for the survivalists, like us.  Won't we be laughing when they're being eaten!<br /><br />Read the other reviews for an actual book review.  My short amount of notes here are intended to give the author, Max Brooks, a big thank you for the funniest thing I've read since the Douglas Adam's \\"Hitchhiker\\" series.
0316044938|4.0|This was, in short, a lovely book. Although it took me over a year to complete (life and school present many distractions), this book kept me enthralled with its stunning, brilliant, and at times quite perverse imagery, dazzling metaphors and relatable characters.   This book was exceptionally well written, and while I enjoyed the author's use of diction and sentence structure, I often got so caught up in the story I hardly noticed it, which, to me, is the sign of a engaging read.   Amazing story, except I did feel a twinge of disappointment at the ending. They never caught Mr. Harvey. I understand that the point of this was to show that her family had moved on from her death, but still...I wanted them to catch him! Haha. I also wish it had shown more about Ruth and Ray Singh and their relationship with Susie.   All in all, a very strange portrayal of a murder mystery novel, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who delights in a dark and thrilling novel.
0140430725|4.0|I've been reading Pride and Prejudice on my iPhone through my Kindle for iPhone app...I purchased the book as well but found it easier to read in small increments that the Kindle provides. The story is amazingly written and once I became used to the old English it surprised me how intricate and beautiful it tells the story. The plot itself is so cute. I highly recommend this to women.

0060005696|4.0|Barry Schwartz' engaging study into the confusing landscape of consumer decision making is a clever reminder that things have really gotten out of hand.  Who needs 47 different detergents to do a load of laundry?  Of course, \\"small, medium & large\\" have some extra friends at a typical fast food eatery.  Say hello to \\"extra large, jumbo, collosal, super collosal & biggie size\\".<br /><br />Schwartz makes an obvious point when he suggests that consumers are faced with so many silly choices, all it's doing is wasting our time and energy in making a decision that has little or no significance to the value added to the purchase.  Just to experiment about the silliness of choice we face at the grocery store, I decided to purchase a different variety of detergent every time I need a new batch, to see if there's really any difference.  Nope.  The clothes got just as clean, no matter what the label advertised.<br /><br />The same goes for toothpaste, shampoos, you name it.  I suppose all these variations are driven by the marketing gurus at the various corporations, striving to get that extra market share point; naturally, all this does is raise prices because the extra revenue is needed to pay off these so-called marketing gurus.<br /><br />In the final analysis, Schwartz' findings are not much more profound than what we probably already knew before he wrote this book.  However, it was an enjoyable read, and made me chuckle from time to time.  In this day and age, that's not a bad choice.

B00004X01U|5.0|In 2000, Madonna released her twelfth album entitled, MUSIC. While the Techno sound remains, this album is very different from RAY OF LIGHT, featuring a Futuristic Techno Dance sound for the new millennium. With this album, Madonna, once again, proves to us fans that she truly is the Queen.    MUSIC  The album's first single. This track is another one of Madonna's most energetic songs. How can anyone resist the urge to hit the dance floor when this song is being played? I know I can't.    IMPRESSIVE INSTANT  This song is one hell of a tune. I really wish it would have been released as a single. I think it could have been a huge hite.    RUNAWAY LOVER  Awesome song. Sounds very reminiscent of Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT era.    I DESERVE IT  Great song.    AMAZING  Another awesome song, sounding very reminiscent of Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT era.    NOBODY'S PERFECT  Great song.    DON'T TELL ME  The album's second single. I seriously love this song. It is another one of Madonna's very best songs.    WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL  The album's third & final single. This is a great song, with a great message. The music video for this song was Madonna's second music video to completely banned from MTV & VH1. Only this time, it was due to the music video's violent nature.    PARADISE (NOT FOR ME)  Great.    GONE  Great sng.    This is another one of Madonna's greatest pieces of work. This album is a true work of art, and all Madonna fans should already have this album. Just remember that, \\"...Music makes the people come together. Music makes the bourgoisie and the rebel...\\"

B000002NJS|5.0|In 1998, Madonna released her eleventh album entitled, RAY OF LIGHT. This amazing albumshows us a new Madonna, a Madonna that we've never seen before: A late '90s spirtual Madonna, with the sound of spiritual dance & techno. Madonna has worked with many great producers in the past, but for this album, she wanted the spiritual sound of the '90s, she recruited William Orbit to produce this album.     DROWNED WORLD / SUBSTITUTE FOR LOVE  The album's third single, though, not released in the U.S. This amazing song describes how Madonna has felt about her fame, since the birth of her daughter, Lourdes. What an amazing song.    SWIM  Great song.    RAY OF LIGHT  The album's second single. One of the best and energetic songs in Madonna's career. I can listen to this song all day, if I had to.    CANDY PERFUME GIRL  This song is just absolutely brilliant. I love the fusion of techno and rock on any song.    SKIN  Love it.    NOTHING REALLY MATTERS  The album's fifth & final single. Love this song. The sound and Madonna's vocals are just pure amazement.    SKY FITS HEAVEN  Great song.    SHANTI / ASHTANGI  An amazing song, actually. This song is sun entirely in Sanskrit.    FROZEN  The album's first single. This is one of the best songs on the album, not to mention one of my all-time favorites. The music video is definitely one of Madonna's greatest. Seeing Madonna taking up a Gothic look for the music video put a huge smile on my face.     THE POWER OF GOOD-BYE  The album's fourth single. Another awesome song.    TO HAVE AND NOT TO HOLD  Great song.    LITTLE STAR  This beautiful song is about Madonna's daughter, Lourdes.    MER GIRL  What an amazing song, although, it is rather creepy.    This album is a masterpiece and only Madonna could have done an album, like this. All Madonna fans should already have this album in their collection. I know I have it in my collection.
0439023491|4.0|Hopefully that paragraph isn't too spoilerific for you. If so, sorry. It's my review, and I did mention that there were slight spoilers, so you had it coming.<br /><br />The inherent weakness in a second book comes, I feel, from expectations ingrained in us from birth as readers. We want a happy ending, and a second book simply cannot deliver that. So, I fully expect there to be much gnashing of teeth and bemoaning the fact that we'll have to wait another year, perhaps more, to see the grand finale of what happens to our heroes. That's to be expected, and I'll try not to let that cloud my judgement in reviewing the book.<br /><br />Something that was somewhat unexpected was the seeming drop in intelligence of our hero, Katniss. I expected her to be a little more on the ball, considering what she'd been through in the last book. I was left wanting somewhat in that regard. Don't read too much into this, she's still a great character. I was just looking for her to brighten up a bit, and I suppose she did, just not as much as I wanted.<br /><br />Another minor beef I had with this book was the entirely-too-convenient plot twists. It's almost like Collins couldn't think of anything more dramatic than the original Hunger Games as a story, and so she just moved the characters back into that environment. I'm not complaining too much, since it's always good to see Katniss at her best, killing and surviving, but I was hoping for a little more character growth. This section of the overarching plot almost seemed more like a middle grade book rather than a young adult, in that Katniss spent entirely too much time reacting to things, and not enough time acting. All the clever defiances of the capitol were set up for her, and the big reveal of what's really going on at the end (a staple of almost any second book) was completely given to her, rather than puzzled out. She did make a couple of discoveries, so I guess I might just be grasping at straws here....no, I'm not. This was a weakness in the book, and that's that. For a character as strong as Katniss is, she was weaker in the thinking department in this second book.<br /><br />On the plus side of things, I felt that the writing was top notch, again. The love scenes and the romance of Katniss and Gale, and Katniss and Peeta was well done, and thankfully much briefer than I expected given the first act of the book and what Katniss and Peeta were trying to accomplish. Also, the contrived plot that I mentioned above could be forgiven for being thought up by the antagonist rather than the author trying to write her way back into her comfort zone.<br /><br />Despite my complaints above, I give this book a 8.5/10. It's a must read for fans of the series, and fans of post-apocalyptic sci-fi in general, especially if they happen to be between the ages of 14 and 18. My hats off to Collins, for delivering an excellent second book. I'm sure that the second book is the hardest to write, and although she didn't break any ground here as far as how to write it, it was still well done. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go back to surfing the web, looking for a convenient way to get an ARC of the third book and avoid the pain of waiting a whole year.weakness in the book, and that's that.

B000002MUW|5.0|In October of 1994, Madonna released her ninth album entitled, BEDTIME STORIES. This album features a completely different sound than her previous albums. This album features a mixture of mid-'90s Pop, Smooth R&B, and Techno. This is another great album.     SURVIVAL    A great song about Madonna trying to survive in career. Whether it's Heaven or Hell, she's gonna be living to tell.    SECRET    The album's first single. This song is absolutely incredible. That acoustic guitar fused with a techno and R&B sound is, to me, the perfect combo. This is just a great song all together.    I'D RATHER BE YOUR LOVER  (Performed by Madonna & Me'Shell NdegéOcello)    An okay song.    DON'T STOP    Great song.    INSIDE OF ME    This song is actually about Madonna's mother. What a great song.    HUMAN NATURE    The album's fourth & final single. Another awesome song. This was Madonna's response to the critics' hateful opinions of her during her sexual stints of 1992-1993. Love this song.    FORBIDDEN LOVE    A great song here. A really, really great song.    LOVE TRIED TO WELCOME ME    This another one of the prettiest ballads Madonna has ever recorded. One of my favorite Madonna songs.    SANCTUARY    Another great song.    BEDTIME STORY    The album's third single. This is a great song, and it is another one of my favorites. The music video is a \\"Bedtime Story\\" destined to give children nightmares for it's freakish and creepy atmosphere.    TAKE A BOW    The album's second single. Madonna had a really huge hit with this song. Almost everyone, if not everyone, took this song to their hearts. Even her most hateful critics took this song to their hearts. This is another one of Madonna's most beautiful and heartfelt ballads.    What an amazing album BEDTIME STORIES is. The album, in my opinion, and probably the opinions of other Madonna fans, is one of Madonna's most underrated and underappreciated albums. This album is a real treat for any and all Madonna fans.
B0000025T6|5.0|This album can only be described as excellent. Outrageously different than anything he did before, this album proved that he could deliver a lyric as good or better without a band accompanying him. Many of his greatest songs are on this album, including \\"Atlantic City\\" (my favorite \\"Boss\\" song), \\"Highway Patrolman\\", and \\"State Trooper\\". And this is for gary mack, some dude who gave this album a ONE STAR REVIEW. Springsteen sings these songs similar to the way he sang \\"Sandy\\" on the The Wild, The Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, to get as much emotion from the songs as possible. This, along with the great lyrics makes this a landmark Springsteen album.    P.S. gary, \\"Mary Queen Of Arkansas\\" is from his first album \\"Greeting From Asbury Park, NJ\\", and is a very good song!
B000002N3J|5.0|In 1995, Madonna released her tenth album entitled, SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. It turns out that this album is Madonna's first-ever greatest ballads compilation, featuring fourteen of Madonna's greatest ballads. Some of the songs are old and were released as singles. Some are new and were released as singles, but all of these songs are from Madonna's creativity and heart.    I WANT YOU  (performed by Madonna & Massive Attack)  New song. This song was originally recorded by Marvin Gaye. Now, I've never heard Marvin Gaye's original, but Madonna's cover is really great. This song was planned to be released as the first single from SOMETHING TO REMEMBER. Madonna even filmed a video for the song. But the plans to release this song as a single were abandoned, but the video was still commercially released and aired on MTV & VH1.    I'LL REMEMBER  From the 1994 original motion picture & soundtrack \\"With Honors\\". This beautiful song was released as a single & theme song for the film, \\"With Honors\\", starring Brendan Frasier and Joe Pesci. A beautiful song.    TAKE A BOW  From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Such an amazingly beautiful song, a song that I will never tire of hearing.    YOU'LL SEE  New song. The album's first single. This is another one of Madonna's beautiful ballads. I remember that this song was the second song I had heard from Madonna back in 1996. Beautiful song. The music video for this song was shot as a sequel to Madonna's music video for \\"Take A Bow\\".    CRAZY FOR YOU  From the 1985 original motion picture & soundtrack \\"Vision Quest\\". \\"Crazy For You\\" has always been one of my favorite Madonna songs. Madonna had performed this song on her first-ever concert tour, \\"The Virgin 1985 Tour\\". After \\"The Virgin 1985 Tour\\", Madonna had never performed the song again on her subsequent tours. But in 2004, on her \\"Re-Invention 2004 Tour\\", Madonna performed it again for the first time in 19 years.    THIS USED TO BE MY PLAYGROUND  From the 1992 original motion picture\\"A League Of Their Own\\". One of my favorites. In my opinion, what makes this song really special is that this is the theme song for the 1992 fact-based Comedy / Drama film, \\"A Leauge Of Their Own\\", in which Madonna had a co-starring role. The film takes place in 1943, during World War II. Most of the men that played major league baseball fought in the war, causing baseball to shut down, until the All American Girls Professional Baseball League was formed. Madonna plays Mae Mordabito, centerfieldsman for the Rockford Peaches. Her teammates call her \\"All The Way\\" Mae.    LIVE TO TELL  From the 1986 album \\"True Blue\\". Another favorite of mine. This song, for me, was one of the many highlights during Madonna's \\"Confessions 2006 Tour\\".    LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE (Remix)  Original version from the 1984 album \\"Like A Virgin\\". The album's third & final single. A great song. The original version of this song, which had made an earlier appearance on Madonna's 1984 album, LIKE A VIRGIN, was not released as a single. At the time, back in 1984, the only release this song was given, was a promo release. This song wasn't released as a single until 1996. Madonna shot the music video, while she was shooting \\"Evita\\".    SOMETHING TO REMEMBER  From the 1990 album \\"I'm Breathless\\". Though, never released as a single, this song was a perfect choice to include here. The song's title was even perfect enough to name the album, as well. Beautiful song.    FORBIDDEN LOVE  From the 1994 album \\"Bedtime Stories\\". Despite the fact this song was never released as a single, it is still an amazing song.    ONE MORE CHANCE  New song. The album's second single, though not released in the U.S. An okay song.    RAIN  From the 1992 album \\"Erotica\\". Beautiful song, with an amazing music video. This song should have been a major hit.    OH FATHER  From the 1989 album \\"Like A Prayer\\". Still such a beautiful and heartfelt song.    I WANT YOU (Orchestral Version) (Performed by Madonna & Massive Attack)New song. This version definitely lives up to Madonna's album version.    This album is definitely amazing in many ways. The album name is so appropriate in every way. This album is also a real treat for all Madonna fans around the world.
B000000WI6|4.0|I know, I know; all you wanted to do was lay down and relax, and then someone had to go and put this into the changer. What's that feeling, down in your feet? What's that -- you want to get up and *move*? -- maybe even *dance*? There really must be something wrong with you, boy -- better get yerself checked out before you succumb to boogie fever or rock-and-roll flu!<br /><br />Well. It's not likely you've even come to this page without having serious interest in the white-haired guitarist from Texas, so I won't presume you don't know just what Johnny Winter is all about.<br /><br />I will however go against the grain of Winter-fandom and proclaim Johnny's two 1990's releases as being every bit as good as the early releases he's best known for -- even better, IMHO, than the \\"JW And\\" era. Those early releases tended toward excessive soloing -- the hallmark of the age, really, and Johnny was as much a harbinger as practitioner of the style.<br /><br />These Pointblank releases, however, find Johnny just right: it's all Johnny (just as he should be) but finally framed at his best. His singing is emotive and expressive, and so is his guitar. The band is his regular trio, totally in sync with his Johnnyness. Guest appearances are fantastically appropriate (especially Dr John!), and the song styles give a nice variety. Simply put, it's Johnny at the top of his game, front to back. [Just as good: the followup release, HEY WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?]<br /><br />Personal favorites include \\"The Illustrated Man\\" (so perfect for him, it's surprising he didn't write it), T-bone Walker's \\"Blue Mood\\" (here done acoustically), and \\"Hey You\\", which plumbs the depths of social inquiry in the guise of the most hoppin' party tune ever -- not only will you be smiling, but you should also be exhausted enough to finally get that nap you were wanting beforehand :)
B000PKX2KA|5.0|Couple this device with a netbook, some good mapping software, and you've got a sweet navigation tool. Took it for a test run in my car, with a Lenovo S10 netbook, MS Streets & Trips; and it worked perfectly. After about a minute of sat acquisition time (I didn't time it, but it took a noticeable chunk of time, and it could have been the software's fault...) I was up and running. Everything looked spot on with the maps and I was surprised at how accurate the Speedometer reading was. This is a serious device, and great if you'd like to do some DIY projects, or set up a custom in car nav solution on the cheap. Installation was pretty painless, just like any other peripheral (driver disc included). The bottom of the device is magnetic, however, I dunno if I'd trust it to stay on top of the outside of the car. Came with a little suction cup for windshield mounting, though. There's lots of free software out there to try out with this unit. Check this site out:[...]  Enjoy!

B000001F45|4.0|`Demons and Wizards' consolidated Uriah Heep's international success and was their first big hit in the States but unfortunately the band didn't take the time to enjoy it and were rushed back into the studio to produce their second LP of 1972, `Magician's Birthday'.  It is a fine record considering the band must have been tapped creatively and physically.  While it isn't as good as the two previous records, it does boast for the first time in Heep's history, the same lineup on consecutive albums. The chemistry of the Box, Byron, Hensley, Thain and Kerslake Uriah Heep would be volatile, ultimately short-lived but beloved among fans.  Favorites include the two most famous cuts \\"Sunrise\\" and \\"Sweet Lorraine\\", both songs single material and immediately memorable for their harmonies and progressive rock power.  The title track, speaking of progressive, is sort of a long disjointed monster.....not the pile of overdone dung that marred the `Salisbury' record, but nowhere as compelling as \\"July Morning\\".  \\"Rain\\" is a grand ballad sung beautifully by Byron and \\"Blind Eye\\" is an interesting idea that mixes acoustic with a galloping lead guitar from Mick Box.  Again `Magician's Birthday' is not as great as the sum of some of its parts but the band was still force...the decline would soon begin...

Oh yeah, and it gets better each listen. Xmas song? Check ... -- what? Oh yes, my friend; Johnny not only includes a seasonal favorite, but his brother joins to make it a truly classic performance. While he was at it, Edgar added some touches to a couple other pieces as well, but \\"Please Come Home For Christmas\\" is the obvious highlight.<br /><br />Not that this release didn't have any without him: \\"Boogie Real Low\\" has the band stretching out behind Johnny's ferocious slide, which he whips out again for the faster-than-fast \\"You Must Have a Twin\\". Billy Branch adds some much-needed harmonica here and there, but the real star of this album is the man it should be: Johnny himself, whose playing sounds somehow deeper than ever before. It's not surprising that Johnny didn't make another record for several years after this; there just may not have been much left to say :)

055380684X|5.0|As a musician and career teacher, I have always been chasing the elusive keys to talent and skill development.  Coyle takes a lot of old anecdotal evidence, new brain science, and his personal research of \\"talent hotbeds\\" around the world and mixes them together into a recipe for greatness.  Is it this simple?  Probably not, but it is much more empowering and motivating than waiting for your genes (or those of your students) to kick in or fail to do so.      Can you really manufacture talent? Coyle makes a strong case for the affirmative.  How else can you explain a run-down tennis club that produces eight of the top twenty female tennis players in the world or the other unlikely hotbeds? The recipe (though not in the order Coyle presents them) is:    1. Master Coaching.  This includes the essential elements of:    2. Ignition- (What inspires young people to embark on the long hard journey to greatness) and     3. Deep Practice- How we build the neural circuits for exceptional skill in any endeavor.    In each of these sections, Coyle build the case for his theory and delivers plenty of specific ingredients for his recipe.  I have long intuitively attributed strange concentrations of talent to great teaching and the students everyday personal knowledge that other achievers around them are mortal humans not unlike themselves.    My first band director always spoke about how lucky he was to have taught in two towns with such a concentration of musical talent.  More likely, he was a Master Coach who excelled at Ignition of the desire to make music at a high level and teaching the fundamentals of Deep Practice. Along with Leopold Mozart and Earl Woods.    In developing band programs at several schools in several states, I watched in amazement as students were stopped flat in their development when they reached what was commonly understood among them as the performance ceiling for players of their instrument at their school only to have them all burst through this ceiling as soon as one among them broke the barrier.  Coincidence?  I think not. More like the phenomenon of 17 runners breaking the 4-minute mile in the year following Roger Bannister performing this \\"impossible\\" feat.    So it rings true to me.  And, like I said, what do we lose by trying instead of hoping we have \\"talent?\\"  Another good read on this topic, though less complete in my opinion, is \\"Talent Is Overrated\\" by Geoff Colvin.  It's heavier on anecdotes and lighter on neural science, so perhaps a better mix for some readers.
0385504225|2.0|Definitely not deserving of the NY times top 10. The story starts off slow, picks up a little bit and then goes down hill. Brown was stretching, especially at the end of the book, to get as many Masonic \\"symbols\\" into the book as he possibly could. It was a \\"mystery\\" book that you could stop reading at any point and not wonder how it ended.

B00280LYHS|5.0|A must have for fans of the series, filled with extreme battles and unexpected suprieses. this book was all i expected
0385342020|5.0|I've always loved Kinsella's \\"Shopaholic\\" books!  I think they are simply outstanding!  For some reason, however, I've found it hard to get into her stand-alone novels.  But, NOT the case here!  TWENTIES GIRL is simply wonderful - and I'm SO glad I bought myself a copy!!    TWENTIES GIRL is about Lara Lington and her great-aunt Sophie.  However, the book starts with Sophie's funeral.  So, how is the book about Lara AND Sophie?  Sophie's a ghost of course! Or, is she Lara's guardian angel?  Either way, Lara finds herself on a mission to track down Sophie's much beloved necklace in order for her, Sophie, to be at peace.  What ensues, however, is so much more!  I'm honestly not sure how Kinsella managed to pack in so many delightful details, much less how she made them all feel completely satisfying and complete.      Though Sophie lives to be 105, she appears to Lara as she remembers herself, as she always felt she was, 23 years old, vivid, spunky, and loads of fun.  The relationship that builds between Sophie and Lara is simply perfect, and they both really deserve each other (for better and worse).    It's soon becomes clear that there's so much more to Sophie than a lost necklace.  And it's soon clear that there's more to Lara than being haunted - there's her jumbled career, her ex-boyfriend, her caring parents, and her egotistical, hugely successful uncle.    A delightful bonus, is that I actually really like the \\"leading man\\" in this book (usually I'm only so-so about Kinsella's men, but this one is definitely much more my type!)  I think the refreshing thing about this book, though, is that it's so much more than a romance!  And it's so much more than a mystery!  It's truly a book about friendship and appreciating the people in your life.      I laughed so many times when reading - and yes, I even cried.  I'm not sure how Kinsella does it - there never seems to be extensive explanations or descriptions, but I always feel I have a total understanding of the characters and their world, and I feel completely connected, like they are my friends.    Highly recommended!!! :D
B0009VPFSW|5.0|I have an old digital camera that only takes this size flash card.  Fits perfectly and works grand.  I love my old camera and did not want to buy a new one.  So I shopped on Amazon and found what I wanted.  The only sad part was I asked for fast shipping and it took 10 days.  I will admit there was a holiday involved, but it still came too late for my vacation.  The product is great, the shipping was BAD!
B001HYX3IY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was probably not for everybody as he goes into GREAT detail on some things. It's well worth the \\"slower\\" parts to get to his over all idea though.After I finished it I immediately bought \\"The 3rd Chimpanzee\\" and liked it as well. His other book \\"Collapse\\" I didn't like so much because it seemed to have more of a political slant than an honest study of the facts.[[ASIN:0393061310 Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies]][[ASIN:0060845503 The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal (P.S.)]][[ASIN:0143036556 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]

B001BWQWKS|5.0|This is a fantastic disc. Quatuor &Eacute;b&egrave;ne are a brilliant quartet, and their debut disc of Haydn remains a firm favourite of mine. This disc is just as good, showing that they have as much empathy with Ravel, Debussy and Faur&eacute; as Haydn and their superb technique, faultless intonation and brilliant mutual understanding are well in evidence here.<br /><br />BBC Radio 3's Building A Library reviewer recently chose this recording of the Faur&eacute; quartet as the best available - in the face of phenomenal competition from the world's best quartets of the last 80 years - and the disc has just won \\"Recording of the Year\\" at the 2009 Gramophone Awards - one of the most prestigious awards available anywhere. It's a deserved honour for a terrific recording by a very fine quartet. I'm delighted, and these awards probably say a lot more than I can about the quality of this disc. It's fabulous and very warmly recommended.

0385504225|3.0|Although I enjoyed this book, it wasn't as good as the previous two: Angels and Demons/ The Da Vinci Code. I think Dan Brown is so popular that he thinks anything he writes turns to gold. And the suspense lags because of it. There needed to be more than just one villian in this story, and maybe a stir that REALLY effected National Security. This story kind of reminded me of a Scooby-Doo plot.       But the last 30 pages were real fascinating to me. If the book was more about that, then maybe we'd be in there, describing this thing as a five-star quality! But maybe in the next book? As for this one, I can't give more than a 7 out of 10.
1401300529|4.0|David Halberstam's final book, the Coldest Winter, offers a great primer on the early days of the Korean War.  The book starts with the  immediate lead-up to the war, its early terrible days for the US and UN forces, the counterstrike at Inchon, the US drive to the north, and the Chinese resistance and push back.  The end of the book sets up the longer and better known stage of the war, the stalemate along the 38th parallel.  I was certainly familiar with the bare bones of the Korean War when I read the book, but I did not know the particulars of MacArthur's undermining of US policy or the extent the Chinese were involved.      Halberstam has two major focuses:  1. The individuals actually fighting in Korea, the hardships they faced, and their bravery.  Some of the stories, including an early one about an injured soldier miraculously surviving and crawling back to US forces for over a week, will stay with you long after you finish the book.  2. The failings of the senior military leadership in the Korean theater, particularly MacArthur and Ned Almond.  To be fair to these generals, some of the confusion and poor decisions may have had to do with the fog of war and not just stupidity and ego.  But the evidence Haberstam musters for the egos of these men is pretty damning.    The book does not get into two political matters that would have been interesting.  The book quickly summarizes how the UN became involved, but did not discuss what resources were actually committed by the other UN nations.  The book also does not go into MacArthur's machinations after being removed from his command.
B002LVVCIK|5.0|Excellent!!  A must see.  Only the blind and misinformed can ignore the message of this movie.
157912688X|2.0|Let me start by saying that I have read as many Agatha Christie books as I possibly could.  Sad Cypress started out extremely well and held my interest throughout, providing wonderful insights to human nature and feelings, with a slew of possibilities for suspects.  I couldn't put the book down!  Why am I not recommending this book?  The actual culprit was not just a surprise, but seemed to come out of nowhere and really had no connecting motive to the story.  I think I would have given this book a rave review if I just didn't read the ending.<br />Sorry.
0439023483|5.0|THE HUNGER GAMES is a great piece of entertainment.  While this novel is designed for the Young Adult market, its plot is better constructed and more imaginative than most books I've read for adults.<br /><br />The dystopian storyline deals with a young woman forced to participate in a reality show where the contestants are forced to fight to the death.  While this idea is far from original, author Suzanne Collins is able to breathe a great deal of life and vitality into her characters and situations.<br /><br />The result is a novel filled with excitement and surprises.  Once THE HUNGER GAMES gets going, there is hardly a dull moment.  This book does suffer from some shallow characterization (particularly in its villains), but the compelling, lightning-fast plot more than makes up for it.<br /><br />For a YA novel, THE HUNGER GAMES is a surprisingly violent read, and includes violence directed against young children.  While none of it is gratuitous, some of it is quite heartwrenching.  I therefore wouldn't recommend this book to a sensitive child or one under the age of thirteen.<br /><br />THE HUNGER GAMES is a YA novel an adult can fully enjoy.  I liked it far more than TWILIGHT, and almost as much as the early entries in the HARRY POTTER series.  I can see why this book is seen by many as the \\"next big thing\\" in YA literature.  This is the first of a series, and I look forward to reading the next entry.
0634049011|5.0|Very good beginning to intermediate level information. Also for the \\"rusty\\" guitar player this will help bring back the things you knew but in a new and helpful way. It's been a great help to me.
0385504225|4.0|=The Da Vinci Code= was a hard act to follow, and I can't say that Dan Brown either met or exceeded the standards he established in his previous book, which discredited (nay, virtually decimated) Christianity and exposed the many atrocities committed in its name, to the delight of many who were really sick of the Christian fascism exhibited by so many far right-wing Republicans during the Bush administration.    Dan Brown books always contain a large amounts of very interesting background information and this one didn't disappoint in that area, with its many details about Masonry, noetic science, symbolism in paintings by Albrecht Durer, references to hidden science in ancient scripture, mysticism, the relationship between the mind and quantum physics, the power of intention, the effects of meditation, and attaining mental powers by merging with \\"The One\\".      The author talked a great deal about the \\"Lost Word\\", the \\"Ineffable Word\\"--- which, if a person were to discover it or accidentally say it, he could become instantly enlightened and endowed with omniscience and an understanding of buried Ancient Mysteries that have been sought by Masons, Rosicrucians, philosophers, meditators, alchemists, and other assorted occultists.  But one of the places where the book failed for me is how at the end, the author is not terribly clear about what his definition of the Lost Word exactly is.  First he says it's a circumpunct, a circle with a dot inside of it that represents The Source or merging with The One, which makes a great deal of sense from a mystical or Eastern philosophy standpoint.  But then he starts talking about how \\"The Word\\" equals the Bible, where some have found hidden scientific meanings.  Or, \\"Laus Deo\\", which translates as \\"Praise God\\".  Or, \\"Jeova Santus Unus\\", which translates as \\"One True God\\".      So--- the thing that offends me about the end of the book is that first he comes to a mystical solution, but then it seems like he twists it to make it sound like a Christian solution.  It's almost as though he was coming to the end of a really good book, but then a bunch of Republicans kidnapped him, took him into a room and told him how his previous book made them really  mad, and then they forced him to put a Christian twist onto the end of this one.    It would make sense, from a Masonic standpoint, to \\"merge\\" all religions together at the end of the book, because Masonry does merge all religions, but it just seemed to me that with all of the expostulating about \\"Praise God\\" and \\"the Word equals the Bible\\" and \\"One True God\\" that he was coming to more of a Christian conclusion, which to me was disappointing and somewhat offensive.  At the very end, he speaks of \\"God\\" as a symbol of man's potential, but I guess the fact that is sounded like a male god instead of an androgynous \\"god\\" made it seem Christian to me instead of universal.    The character Mal'akh made more sense, in a weird sociopathic way, when he was talking about trying to attain \\"fleshless sentience\\" (that would occur during meditation) and his statement about how god had no gender and was an androgyne.  That is what the ancients believed and it makes sense today, because:  Asking a woman to worship a male god is sexist, and diminishes the woman.  Asking a black person to worship a white god is racist and diminishes the black person, asking a homosexual to worship a chaste heterosexual makes no sense, and asking the mother of a child to worship a \\"pure\\" virgin makes her seem unclean because she has been de-virginated.    I was also interested in the \\"John gesture\\" made by the severed hand and made in what Dan Brown says are three of Leonardo's paintings (but it is also made by the baby representing John the Baptist in the Madonna of the Rocks, so it's actually in FOUR of Leonardo's paintings). I read something in Madame Blavatsky about how a raised index finger was supposed to signify \\"back to the grove\\", i.e., back to the paganism, back to the mystery schools that practiced sacred sexuality and rituals that killed the king so that the crops could grow, but he was always \\"risen\\" or resurrected by a woman, with whom he then \\"merged\\" sexually in the same way that mystics merge with The One.  Actually, in Leonardo's painting of St. John the Baptist, his forefinger is \\"risen\\" but so is another part of his anatomy, which would tie in with the whole sacred sexuality aspect of Madame Blavatsky's explanation of the gesture. But--- Dan Brown just says that this gesture, also depicted in a statue of George Washington, is \\"a well-known symbol of the Ancient Mysteries\\" and an invitation to be initiated into mysteries or ancient knowledge (or the hieros gamos).    Another thing that bothered me about the book:  Katherine, the noetic scientist, talks about how \\"today's science was not so much making 'discoveries' as it was making 'rediscoveries'\\" because mankind had \\"let go\\" what they once knew.  Well, I think the author should have pointed out that the reason much of the ancient science was lost was because Christians (and also Muslims) burned the Library of Alexandria, in their attempts to destroy paganism and science and enhance religion, and that efforts to nourish science were further inhibited by the Church during the 1000 years following the Fall of Rome, which were completely dominated by Christianity.    Anyway, it's a very interesting book--- but the conclusion is ... somewhat murky.
B0029XFN8A|5.0|Most would probably put this movie off as another TNA teen male movie (and I mean, it is that, don't get me wrong), but I like to think that even though it's glammed up to sell to guys eager to see some cinematic porn-starrish action, it's also got a strong message about finding love in today's society. Albeit with an ex-pornstar.    What I liked about the underlying tone of the movie was that it enforces that love is an act of endless forgiveness, and if you love somebody, you're willing to fight for it. And not only does the main character fight for it, but he and his friends make you laugh your butt off with their antics, especially the trip to the adult film festival in Las Vegas.    My biggest piece of advice when watching this movie is to have an open mind, because not quite everything in the movie is what you'd expect it to be. Would definitely recommend you be over the age of 18 to thoroughly embrace all the humor.
0891419195|5.0|This book is a compelling first hand account, from a U. S. Marine private's view, of the hourly and daily horrors American Marines suffered when in battle in the Pacific during WWII. Frankly, I am surprised anyone could endure the strain, both physical and mental, imposed upon these American soldiers. After reading this relatively short, but detailed book, you will reach several conclusions: first, the Pacific campaigns were absolutely hellish; second, the Japanese WWII soldier was fanatical and bestial--virtually devoid of any humanity; third, after Okinawa, the U.S. was absolutely right in using the atomic bomb to end this war; and fourth, we can never repay the men (primarily U. S. Marines) who made the sacrifices necessary to conquer the evil that was Imperial Japan.<br /><br />The book is centered on two battles, Peleliu and Okinawa: the former fought in 100 degree heat on a coral island lacking any shelter or cover, while the latter was fought in mud on a battlefield reminiscent of trench warfare in WWI Flanders. Both battles were fought against a determined, merciless, and barbaric enemy who fought virtually to the last man and were more than willing to sacrifice their individual lives if they could trade it for the life of but one American. For example, on Peleliu the Japanese committed approximately 11,000 soldiers to the battle and only about 200 surrendered, yet of that number approximately 180 were Japanese sailors, or civilians forced to assist the Japanese. The rest died to a man. The price for their lives and this miserable island was approximately 1800 American dead and another 8000 wounded.<br /><br />The book explains the Japanese strategy of \\"defense in depth\\" adopted after the fruitless banzai charges of Guadalcanal and Saipan. This strategy entailed the construction of mutually supportive tunnels, caves, and other defensive positions that the Japanese defended in a prolonged, organized retreat. Essentially, they knew they could never win these battles, but hoped, through attrition, to convince the Americans that it was too costly in blood and treasure to conquer Japan. E. B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge lets you experience what fighting against this strategy was like as he watches his friends and comrades die day after day during these long campaigns. He especially relates, in an immediate manner, how taxing the fighting conditions were--intolerable heat, knee-deep mud, the constant stench of decaying bodies and the innumerable flies and maggots attracted to them, the poor food, undrinkable water, malaria, dysentery, constant rain, and filth each marine had to endure in wresting these islands from the Japanese. Yet that is only the beginning, for the true horror was the Japanese themselves. Nightly they sent out raiders to try to infiltrate American lines, willing to die just to kill one American in his foxhole. Every night these marines were shelled, and everyday they were forced to move out against an enemy who would never surrender and wanted only to kill them.<br /><br />You are left with an unshakable belief of this war being worse than hell itself, worse than anything you can imagine. The stories of discovering the mutilated bodies of fellow marines, and the cold-blooded nature of the enemy, explains why this enemy had to be defeated and why these marines had absolutely no pity for them. And once you read the nature of the battle for Okinawa, and learn how the U. S. was forced to sacrifice over 12,000 of its young men to kill 110,000 Japanese who refused to surrender in a battle hopeless for Japan from the start, you should have no reservations about the wisdom of using atomic weapons against Japan. If they were willing to fight like this for an island hundreds of miles from their homeland, you realize they would have fought even harder for their own islands and homes.ed, through attrition, to convince the Americans that it was too costly in blood and treasure to conquer Japan.

0684824906|5.0|Team of Rivals is a fantastic book.  Although by training I am an ancient historian, I have recently taken an interest in the American Civil War era and its effects on the postwar society of the time.  A friend from the OR was reading it and recommended it, so I purchased it.  It took a while for the book to emerge from the pile of books by my bed, but I finally read it.  It was so fascinating I completed it in about 3 days, all 757 pages.<br /><br />While I have read books on the Civil War and on Lincoln before, I find that many of them come to see the assassination of Lincoln as the central drama played out against the backdrop of the war.  While much is made of the man, especially at his end, less is made of him as a politician and a person placed at the crossroads of history.  He is more myth than man in these accounts.  The focus on every detail of his last hours and upon his assassins motives and ends reflects more on the modern fascination with death and murder  in all its vivid detail than on history and those that made it.<br /><br />Writer Doris Goodwin's (PhD in Government) book is a marvelous look at Lincoln as a political force.  She discusses his remarkable growth as a young man, his law practice and political aspirations.  More than any other writer on Lincoln, Dr. Goodwin presents the man as a person of intelligence, incredible ambition, and a sense of his own place in history.  His desire to be worthy of remembrance by doing something remarkable for mankind marks him as a man of note, even before Lincoln the president takes the stage.<br /><br />In order to place Lincoln in context, the author discusses his rivals and their political development and personal history along with those of Lincoln himself.  If I had read the book for no other reason, this would still have made it more worthwhile than any other.  She has pulled so many primary sources together that each man, and even those who supported him, becomes a vivid personality in the mind of the reader.  In fact, I knew so little previously about any of them beyond their names, they had hardly entered into my concept of the Civil War era.  I had heard some of their names in other contexts, specifically Seward as the purchaser of Alaska--\\"Seward's Folly\\" as it was labeled at the time--but nothing much else.  Dr. Goodwin's biographical sketch of each made me realize how narrowly the country came to having had some other politician at the helm at this point in time.  Each had so much to recommend him for the presidency and such history of political contributions in their past that I realize now how totally extraordinary Lincoln`s election really was.<br /><br />Only by a delft handling of political situations by a master strategist, which he apparently was, could have placed Lincoln in the right place at the right time to be nominated, and only his genius for recognizing his rivals potential and making use of it got him elected.  While the image of \\"Lincoln the story teller, rail splitter and simple prairie lawyer\\" that we received in grade school is real, so too is the \\"Lincoln the skillful and ambitious politician.\\"  And we have much to be thankful for this.  I feel somehow that the experience of the enormity of the Civil War would have felled most of his rivals long before its end with dire consequences to the country.  So far as I can conceive, no other candidate could have withstood the enormous pressures of the presidency at this time except Lincoln, whose unique personal characteristics, particularly his astute assessment of the average person, of his rivals as politicians, and his unbelievable patience could have done the job.  That he was assassinated when it was finally done seems almost providential.  In observing  his actual physical decline in successive photographs through his occupation of the White House, one wonders if he would have survived long after the war anyway.  Stress takes its toll.  Certainly if he had Marfan's Syndrome, as some believe, his days were probably numbered from birth.  One of my own patients died of it at 35, as had his father and one brother before him, and Lincoln was nearly 54 when he died, which is really pushing it.<br /><br />More than any other book, this one discusses the Civil War as a defining event with roots.  The basis of the confrontation was in the struggle to prevent the spread of slavery (Northern) or to promote it (Southern) and in the Great Paradox:  that the first democracy in the world was also one of the only western nations to espouse slavery as a viable and acceptable economic foundation for a society.  The founding fathers had understood this at the beginning of the nation.  Jefferson, who struggled with it as he wrote the constitution, also feared that challenging it would lead to early division of the nascent country, leaving each state to be snapped up by overseas powers.  He and the other patriots of his time consciously left it to a later generation to deal with, and understood both that it would ultimately have to do so and that it would be a blood bath when that finally happened.  That it took 16 presidencies before push finally came to shove is a sign of the compromises to which people were willing to resort to avoid dealing with it.  It also shows how well everyone at the time understood to what it would lead.<br /><br />Interesting too is the author's presentation of the various generals on both sides.  She gives a short biography of each and makes it clear to what extent the entire war was a political stage.  No general, north or south--with the possible exception of Lee, who didn't approve of the war in the first place--would risk defeat in the field--indeed Lincoln's main problem during the first years of it was his various general's inactivity.  While winning a battle might make a hero of a man, defeat would certainly render his political ambitions for presidency null, and few were willing to risk it.  This kept armies of men in the field.

One of my own patients died of it at 35, as had his father and one brother before him, and Lincoln was nearly 54 when he died, which is really pushing it.    More than any other book, this one discusses the Civil War as a defining event with roots.  The basis of the confrontation was in the struggle to prevent the spread of slavery (Northern) or to promote it (Southern) and in the Great Paradox:  that the first democracy in the world was also one of the only western nations to espouse slavery as a viable and acceptable economic foundation for a society.  The founding fathers had understood this at the beginning of the nation.  Jefferson, who struggled with it as he wrote the constitution, also feared that challenging it would lead to early division of the nascent country, leaving each state to be snapped up by overseas powers.  He and the other patriots of his time consciously left it to a later generation to deal with, and understood both that it would ultimately have to do so and that it would be a blood bath when that finally happened.  That it took 16 presidencies before push finally came to shove is a sign of the compromises to which people were willing to resort to avoid dealing with it.  It also shows how well everyone at the time understood to what it would lead.    Interesting too is the author's presentation of the various generals on both sides.  She gives a short biography of each and makes it clear to what extent the entire war was a political stage.  No general, north or south--with the possible exception of Lee, who didn't approve of the war in the first place--would risk defeat in the field--indeed Lincoln's main problem during the first years of it was his various general's inactivity.  While winning a battle might make a hero of a man, defeat would certainly render his political ambitions for presidency null, and few were willing to risk it.  This kept armies of men in the field.  Almost as many men if not more were lost to the conditions of the camp as were lost to combat fatality.  Dysentery, malnutrition, and exposure was rampant on both sides of the conflict, thus prolonging the war by avoiding the conflict actually lost more men.

B002JM1VJG|4.0|Like any other Madonna fan I have been eagerly waiting for this release.  This dvd features many of Madonna's greatest videos such as Vogue, Ray of Light & Material Girl.  This collection also features videos that have not been in previous Madonna dvd compilations such as You'll See, Hollywood, & Deeper and Deeper.  Overall, the selection of videos is satisfying but it is not complete.  You would think that after so many years, Warner Bros. would release a compilation that would include every single Madonna video.  Unfortunately, we will have to wait for a truly complete set to be released (if that ever happens).    The Good:    We get 47 videos!  A mix of previously & never-before released set of videos.    The Bad:    Several videos are missing such as: Bad Girl, Oh Father, This Used To Be My Playground, & American Life (Flag Version & Uncensored).  I don't understand why American Life was not included in this compilation.  The uncensored video is not even all that controversial.  Why does Warner insist on keeping this video from being released on dvd???  Instead of adding the atrocious video to Miles Away, they should of placed a real video.  Also, why didn't we get the official video to Get Together?  I was disappointed to see the alternate version.    Another disappointment is the censoring of Justify My Love & Erotica.  Are we still in the early 1990s???  I was very shocked to see the ugly black bar in the middle of the Justify video.  It is ridiculous and a slap in the face to get censored versions.    The video quality is definitely not high definition but I think that Madonna's older videos are forgivable since they weren't filmed in high definition in the first place.  The disappointed lies in the newer videos.  Many of them seem grainy & not what you expect to see in 2009.  The videos that have appeared in previous compilations are pretty much the same in this compilation.  There is really nothing new (with the exception of 'Celebration', no behind-the-scenes, or any type of extras as stated in the description.  One major difference lies in three videos which appear here but are different from the ones featured in the 'Immaculate Collection' DVD.  Lucky Star, Express Yourself, and Cherish are edited here in this collection (The original versions can be found on the Immaculate dvd).     It would of been nice to have an introduction by Madonna and maybe some commentary on the videos (such as what Jennifer Lopez did for her video compilation, \\"The Reel Me\\" where she was interviewed and gave commentary on every single video she released at that time).    Final Thoughts:  Overall I am glad that we are able to have a good collection of videos.  There are really only a few missing since several have already appeared on separate compilations.  I hope that Warner is listening and they finally decide to give us a complete set of videos and perhaps on one single dvd!  Although I am sure that they did this on purpose so that they can continue to milk us out of our hard earned money!    For now I am just going to enjoy my music & videos...
1592533868|5.0|This is the best quilling book yet! My quilling experience is limited to only several months and I already owned several other books on the craft/art, but this one has extra lovely projects and ideas.  One person was concerned about the length of paper she uses in her book, but that is of no consequence because you can always cut longer paper into whatever length you want.  Half the fun of quilling is coming up with your own designs.  Copying someone else's designs to the \\"T\\" doesn't make it your own, in my opinion.  The ideas in the books are what are inspiring. Ms Choi is very talented and I can only hope that my quilling will become as beautiful as hers.  This book is a MUST for any quiller.  You will love it!
B000059XUO|5.0|First off this is my favorite move of all time. I LOVE this movie. I wont get into the plot much because you can read thta in any of the hundreds of reveiws but ill say it revolves around true love being forever, never dying and doing anything to set the wrong things right. This movie is even more haunting because it cost star Brandon Lee his life to bring this movie to life. Its based on a comic book of the same name which is also good and Brandon faught to get this movie made. He gives one of the best performances ive ever seen, period. This movie has a bit of everything in it like romance, gothic horror, action it has something for everyone. Go buy this movie,watch it and get lost in Brandon Lee's beautiful performance. Even the music is extremely well done in the film. If you like the movie also check out the graphic novel by James O'Barr. Enjoy.

B000059XUP|3.0|The first crow was an amazing film.haunting and beautiful. This one had so much potential but ultimatly falls a bit short, the main character ash is not as interesting as eric from the first one and at times ash sounds like he barly knows english.i think they shound has founded the same template as the first film and the tow that followed this one by having the crow avatar come back to avenge the murder of him and his girlfriend not his son like this one.to me it didnt seem as powerful or moving.it get three stars because the music was good and it is a crow movie afetr all and i love the crow mythos and the idea that true love lives forever.watch if your a fan and are curious but dont expect the power or emotion of the first crow film.
B001GV09FS|4.0|You will find Chiquitita, I Do, and Waterloo on the Broadway Play Soundtrack.  The Broadway Show of Mamma Mia was 3 hours long and included 25 production songs.  I have seen both the play and the movie.  You cannot compare the two.  I watch the movie alot but I listen the Broadway Play Soundtrack.<br /><br />I Do in the movie was sang during filming.  And it's only a small part.  That is why it's not on the soundtrack.  Same with Chiquitita, the begining and end were sung during filming.  There is a big difference between filming actors singing and recording a song for a CD.
B001UV4XTC|5.0|For college physics professor Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg), life is falling apart. For seemingly no reason, his wife wants to divorce him and be with his colleague. His children have no respect for him; the son steals money to support a marijuana habit and the daughter steals money to save up for a nose job. His brother has little to no social skills, and because he lacks the ability to take care of himself, he lives in Larry's house. At school, the father of a South Korean exchange student is threatening to sue, which is awkward since the student may or may not have bribed Larry for a better grade. He's up for tenure, yet the impending divorce and a property dispute with his neighbor has him up to his neck in legal fees. It seems the only good thing he has going for him is attending his son's bar mitzvah.    We expect quirkiness from a Coen Brothers' film. We might even expect bleakness. \\"A Serious Man\\" gives us all that, and then goes one step further by being philosophically profound. Not profound in that boisterous, overstated way--in which a speech is made and everyone learns a valuable lesson--but in that silent, underhanded way, where theme, character, and plot reveal themselves slowly through carefully constructed symbols. Symbolism is tricky because you always run the risk of overdoing it; even wonderful films like \\"Milk,\\" \\"Gran Torino,\\" and \\"W.\\" occasionally fell victim to obvious imagery. With \\"A Serious Man,\\" most of the symbolism is reserved for cleverly worded anecdotes, which paradoxically explain nothing. Larry is a faithful man, yet the rabbis he visits can't seem to give him decent spiritual advice. Then again, is it possible to find the answers on the outside when the problems are within?    Stuhlbarg is perfectly cast, playing Larry not as the raving comical figure one might expect from a man in his situation. Rather, he plays him as a quietly desperate man, someone who sees everything around him yet can't process how it has all gone wrong. The more he tries to understand the meaning of his life, the less he ultimately discovers. Why, for example, has his wife, Judith (Sari Wagner Lennick), never given any indication that their marriage was in trouble? Why does she want to be with Sy Ableman (Fred Melamed), a man so phony and obnoxious that he should be hated on general principles? Why did Larry have to move into a motel when it would have been much easier for Judith to move in with Sy? Maybe the answers lie with the elusive Rabbi Marshak (Alan Mandell), who Larry has been having trouble making an appointment to see.    What this movie so brilliantly conveys is that paralyzing sense of being on your own in an unsympathetic world. This applies to the look as well as to the people; the Coen Brothers, who grew up in St. Louis Park, Minnesota during the 1960s, have faithfully recreated that time and place, pitting their protagonist against a frighteningly routine mid-twentieth century landscape of identical rambler homes and neatly manicured lawns. But the fact that Larry is having a hard time doesn't necessarily mean we nothing but sympathy for him; he thinks he can solve all his problems simply by visiting rabbis, when in fact they can only provide him with metaphorical observations and long-winded fables that don't really go anywhere. He seeks an insightful message when in fact there isn't one to give, save maybe for the lyrics of a Jefferson Airplane song.    Aside from Larry, the film's most engaging character is his brother, Arthur (Richard Kind), a man whose notebook of rambling mathematical formulas blurs the line between genius and insanity. He physically represents his social awkwardness: Overweight, tall, and perpetually hunched over, with a cyst on the back of his neck that he continuously drains with a special suction machine. He seems like a decent person at heart, although that doesn't mean he isn't capable of doing something wrong. There comes a point when he runs off half naked, crying likea five-year-old while ranting about how unfair God has been to him. He looks at Larry and sees not a miserable soul whose life is falling apart, but as someone who lucked out by getting married and having children. Is he right? I guess that depends on how you define being lucky.    Some audiences will not appreciate the ending, which symbolically makes it clear that virtually nothing has been resolved. We do, however, get a wonderful visual representation of a turning point, something the Coen Brothers are known for including in their films. It's an image that emphasizes more than life's unpredictability; it also emphasizes a new chapter in Larry's life, one we aren't meant to see but know will be just as challenging. One can only hope that he eventually finds the answers he has been looking for. \\"A Serious Man\\" is one of the year's best films--darkly funny and deeply introspective, deliberately paced and cleverly structured, strong in character, dialogue, and imagery. Some of its greatest images are of quirky subtleties, like carefully angled shots of Larry's facial expressions. If you were in his situation, your face would look the same way.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|Go read Roger Ebert's review.    This movie is not 3:10 to Yuma (the remake w/ Bale and Crowe).  There's definitely less action.  However, the film plays like you're reading a dime novel.  Gritty characters.  You can almost taste the dust and feel the biting wind.  I'm not a big fan of Renee Zellweger.  But, personal bias aside she really puts on a good performance - as does Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, AND Jeremy Irons (how can you not love that combination?)    It may be slow to some, but like I said, it plays like you're reading a dime novel.    If you liked this, you'll like David Cronenberg's \\"Eastern Promises\\"  The movie does have its action sequences, but it's more a story about characters and their moral dilemmas.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|I've read a lot of criticizm toward this movie on here.  It's not THAT bad!  Come on, it's got action, philosophy and comedy, the ingredients to a proper Star Trek movie!  No it wasn't the best.  Yes the plot was a bit weak, but I personally think it was a half-decent movie.  The effects are decent for the time it was made, the acting was good, maybe could have been a bit better.  I suppose the plot could have been used in a one-hour episode rather than a movie, but I think that everyone would agree with me when I say that this movie is NOT the worst compared to The Motion Picture, which is the only Star Trek movie I don't like because NOTHING happens in it!  In this one they fight Spock's long lost half brother and find an evil alien claiming to be God (and the part where Spock gives the neck-pinch to a horse is priceless).  In the Motion Picture, what did they do?  Fly through a cloud.  Oooooh, how exciting!<br /><br />No, it's not the best Star Trek movie out there, but I say it was a fun, entertaining installment to the adventure.

1401307787|5.0|Kabat-Zinn does a wonderful job of applying meditative living to one's moment-to-moment, reality accepting life.  Your personal power and clarity for your best life are not in ruminations about the past, not in fear or expectations for the future.  The Divine is in the NOW.  This book provides a connection to the guidance available in you (from your highest self) to experience life with all of your senses and a knowing that it is about the JOURNEY; not what you did or didn't do; not about judgement or pressure for tasks undone.  It is a teaching for living without judgement and with complete acceptance of the way things ARE, NOW. RIGHT NOW.  It is about honouring all of the feelings and thoughts you have and knowing that they are only thoughts and feelings.  They are not who you are or who you think you should be.  It is about NO SHOULDS, OUGHTS, or SHOULD HAVES.  Mindfulness is not easy, at least it is not for me, but you practice as best you can and come back to it if you let your thoughts and feelings live you, instead of you recogizing them and letting them pass as the temporary works of your ego and flight or fight reactions (autonomous work of your body) that they are.  The book is particulary effective when combined with a daily practice of meditation. Kabat-Zinn has several books.  I highly recommend them all.  This way of living has supported me out of the effects of a brain injury and a major several year depression.  Make this commitment to honouring yourself and your life just as it's bud opens, just as it is it's most fragrant and extant with infinite possibility.
B002E2QHBS|5.0|This is the way the concert should have originally been released in perhaps multiple 3 album sets.  It makes one feel the energy of the moment.  I listen to audience tapes and do not mind imperfection so it would have been nice to hear the groups that are not represented, even if there are difficulties with the recordings.  I have really enjoyed hearing this set.  By the way, that it is not Jerry Garcia on the announcement.  I believe it is Ken Babbs from the Merry Pranksters as he is the MC of a Grateful Dead show at Venetia Oregon in August 1972 and he has a destinctive voice.  Thanks for the release.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|I bought Death Magnetic on its release day. It is the loudest album I have ever heard (this is a bad thing! it hurt my ears!) and as a result I haven't listened to it in full (beginning to end) since that day.<br /><br />\\"The Unforgiven III\\" & \\"The Day That Never Comes\\" are the only tracks I can listen to on it, and even then I have to turn DOWN my Zune 120 from its normal volume setting of 3 (of 20).

0061537969|4.0|*POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER*  *  *  Stein's writing is quite lyrical at times and more often than not, he drew me into the story. I enjoyed reading \\"Racing in the Rain\\" and I would recommend it to others with just a few reservations. I caution my fellow readers that this book has more than its share of calculated melodrama; Eve's final disposition will not surprise anyone. Stein did a wonderful job of developing Denny's and Enzo's characters but he dropped the ball on Eve and her parents. I found it especially disconcerting that he drew Denny's parents as one-dimensional bad guys.
B002QW5474|2.0|This is not worth the upgrade for the cost it is going at right now. WB did not remaster Gremlins for Blu-Ray. In my opinion (and many others) the BD is only a small improvement over the DVD. I'd say the improvement in clarity and detail varies between 5%-30% better throughout the film. The audio is much better though, really fun to hear the score in HD audio. Wait till the price drops, then pick it up.
B002C6K7NU|3.0|I'am not going to bore you with an hour long review of this album.  However, it is, what it is; and that being the remainder of what is  Lynyrd Skynyrd. I mean really, do you expect the same music and sound   that was the 70's. I won't mention names here to save time; but, alot  of the group have gone on to await the coming King.  It won't ever be the same without the good ol boys in the band.  This is a good recording. I don't blame the members of the band trying  to get that New Country flavor, that's what sells today.  So, like it or not, take it for what it is; a good wholesome amount of  15-18 southern flavored tracks of Rock N Roll presented under the name  of Lynyrd Skynyrd so enjoy. For we all know that in 3-4 weeks  you all will have put it away for good, never to listen to it again. However  if you're like me, you'll file it in your collection so that it will always  be ready for review again, the next time your sitting out by the fire on a  cool fall night tippin back some brews and hashing out the old times.
B0000V46KY|1.0|I'm beginning to think that the mastering engineers and producers at Mobile Fidelity have only one ear!  Why would they release a stereo album from 1975 in Mono on SACD no less?!  This is not some pre-stereo mono recording.  It never was released on LP in mono.  I don't get it.  Yes, we know all about the \\"back to mono\\" camp, but this is going too far....
1416594787|5.0|Dr. Dawkins gives us a lucid, imminently readable and enjoyable overview of why all knowledgable biologists understand evolution by natural selection (EBNS) to be a fact.  Dawkins presents the data that support the conclusion of EBNS.  He provides a broad sweep of the kinds of data that have been built up, piece by piece until the fit of EBNS to the data has been shown to be simply overwhelming.  Science proceeds by disproof of hypotheses (not proof of anything.)  EBNS has withstood the most detailed investigation by millions of scientists in many disciplines for 150 years, using the most sophisticated instruments and including all the modern discoveries of embryology, genetics, etc.  It has never been disproved.<br /><br />This book is superb and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about why EBNS is simply considered to be a fact, not \\"just a theory.\\"<br /><br />I have also read Dr. Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:0670020532 Why Evolution Is True]].  In comparing it to this book, I would say that in one case, Coyne's book provides a little more data than does this book by Dawkins.  This is in specific data points.  Dr. Coyne provides a bit more of the actual data, rather describing the kind of data, how it's used, and its trends as Dawkins does.  In this way, the books are fairly complimentary.  I suggest that you read both.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Just rented this movie and really enjoyed it.  It's a fun little romantic comedy that will certainly get you in the holiday spirit.  Jack Black is funny, as always.  He also shows a more sensitive side, that you don't always see in his movies.  That was a highlight for me.      The story, in general, is one we can all relate to.  Most of us are working way too hard and bypassing the little things that make life so great.  That was my big takeaway from this.  It was a nice (and sometimes hilarious) reminder to stop and smell the roses.
0385504225|5.0|The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown is an inspirational and ingenious masterpiece that shines brilliantly and uplifts mind and spirit! I savored the rich story during my spare time for more than two weeks and finished it with awe and wonder.       Robert Langdon arrives to Washington DC only to find he was lured there by a fanatical mystic who calls himself Mal'akh. The most terrifying villain ever created by Dan Brown, Mal'akh is a muscular giant tattooed from head to toes with religious and mystical ancient symbols and is set on a quest to be godlike himself, but an evil god. He is obsessed with obtaining the lost word known only by the most elite of Free Masons and to that end he has brutally kidnapped Langdon's longtime dear friend and mentor, billionaire and Secretary of The Smithsonian, Peter Solomon. Mal'akh has cursed the house of Peter Solomon for many years in his relentless pursuit of secret knowledge.       Years ago Peter Solomon trusted Langdon with the golden capstone of the legendary Masonic Pyramid. Mal'akh gives Langdon an ultimatum: in order to save Peter, he will have to decipher the capstone. What follows is a race against time through various Washington Landmarks that yield clues and along the way Langdon puts the pieces of the puzzle together.       Peter Solomon's sister Katherine is a Noetic Scientist whose experiments prove the power of the human mind to affect subatomic matter. The implications of her work are powerful, literally \\"mind over matter.\\" Mal'akh set on destroying the house of Solomon and especially anything that could enlighten humans detours to destroy her lab and would even have killed her if Langdon had not intervened and warned her. But the warning was almost too late. And the scene in which Mal'akh chases her throughout a pitch dark airplane-hanger-like building is utterly chilling, and they way that she escapes is literally brilliant! The scenes of this book linger in my mind continually revealing their multiple layers.Katherine and Langdon team up as they evade the CIA Director of Security, a small, stern and dirty chain-smoking woman Inoue Sato. A survivor of Japanese internment camps and of throat cancer, she hunts them relentlessly pursuing the capstone  and Langdon's decipher skills for her own mysterious reasons.        But just when they believe they have saved Peter, they realize they were tricked again by Make-up wearing Mal'akh. He ambushes them in his secret lair and puts Robert Langdon through the greatest torture imaginable and forces Katherine to watch in horror. He drowns Robert Langdon to make him reveal what he knows about the symbols on the pyramid and then leaves him for dead. Dan Brown raises suspense to a whole new amazing level as the reader is forced to grapple with the words on the pages which tell the story of Robert Langdon's drowning.       The tale becomes even scarier as it is revealed the full facts of who Mal'akh is, what his true motives are and the real reasons why he has relentlessly haunted the life of Peter Solomon. The climactic confrontation between Peter and Mal'akh ends with painful revelation and glass shattering shards of truth that pierce the heart and lead the way to the final breathless scenes.         The Lost Symbol is an incredible novel of life, death mind and spirit! Dan Brown flawlessly weaves the history of the Masons and of the Founding Fathers of our Nation together with notions from ancient wisdom, the Judeo Christian scriptures and Noetic science. The result is an awe inspiring masterpiece of biblical proportions.

B002C1BHIO|5.0|When I first got an HDTV I was really annoyed when I found out that the HDMI cable was over a hundred dollars. Sure you get the optimum video quality but that's a lot of money on top of the already expensive TV. I was excited to test out amazon's cable and I was really pleased with the product. There is no difference is quality between the amazon cable and the one I had before. The only difference is the drastic price difference.    Amazon basics was a great idea. Amazon is a name we can trust and now they provide things we all may need for a better price than most other suppliers. [...] may have low prices as well but Amazon doesn't require a membership to get the low prices. I was really pleased with this amazon basic and I will definitely look to amazon again to purchase my basic goods.

068484267X|5.0|\\"My father and mother should have stayed in New York where they met and married and where I was born (1930) . . . . When I look back on my childhood I wonder how I survived at all. It was, of course, a miserable childhood. . . Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood. People everywhere brag and whimper about the woes of their early years, but nothing can compare with the Irish version: the poverty; the shiftless loquacious alcoholic father; the pious defeated mother moaning by the fire; pompous priests; bullying schoolmasters; the English and the terrible things they did to us for eight hundred long years. Above all - we were wet.\\"<br /><br />With a beginning like that, readers have no doubt that they are in for a story like never before. McCourt doesn't disappoint. Three of his six siblings die of malnutrition and disease, and his father never overcomes alcoholism - endlessly disappointing his family by failing to hold a job and drinking whatever money he had, even the welfare support. They live in a house infested with rats and bed bugs, and flooding in the winter. The home was also hindered by being adjacent to a outhouse shared with the neighborhood. Frank displays signs of aptitude noted by the library staff and one of his teachers, yet he's denied help from the Catholic church and alternates between relying on menial jobs (messenger, delivery-boy) and petty crime to feed his mother, himself, and family. Eventually they were evicted after Frank cut down some of the beams for firewood. Fortunately McCourt survived typhoid at age ten, managed to avoid following his father's drive to drink while yet acquiring his talent for storytelling, carried out his ambition to return to America, and didn't allow his childhood experiences to embitter himself or his writing.<br /><br />\\"Angela's Ashes\\" earned the Pulitzer Prize (1997) for McCourt, and sold over 4 million copies.
1416594787|5.0|If the statistics are true, half of my neighbors, not to mention half of my family, are idiots. I'm still not sure how someone could read this book (or others like it) and say, \\"I don't know, it just doesn't seem right.

Admittedly it took me until my 30s to see how stupid I was. Please, if you're on the fence, read it again. Or even better, move on to Dawkins' earlier book \\"The God Delusion.\\" This is important. We'll wait. We want you to join the rational discourse. Crossing your arms and stomping your feet (and closing your mind) only reminds us how brainwashed religious people really are.     It seems science is always enlightening our understanding of the world we see. Astronomy takes over for Astrology. Chemistry takes over for Alchemy. Philosophy takes over for Religion. Or I suppose you could say Mathematics, Biology, Botany, Zoology, Physics, Medicine and Democracy takes over for Religion.     Dawkins is brilliant here, just as always. Buy the book if you haven't. Share it if you have.
0307386171|4.0|'On Chesil Beach' is really a very basic story about two British newlyweds circa 1963 who \\"have issues\\" on their wedding night.  Ian McEwan, who always writes so beautifully, does a superb job in going into detail about this couple and how their lives lead up to this momentous night.  My only disappointment is that it ended all too soon!  That is, not too much is said about what happens after that night.  I felt slightly cheated and disappointed.      Bottom line: delicious literary brain food.  Recommended.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|We waited 5 years for this?  It's really too bad this book didn't come out before The DaVinci Code or Angels and Demons.  I truly liked both of those books, actually I have enjoyed all of his books.  This book was just WAY too formulaic.  It was the Angels and Demons, but fill in the blanks with The Lost Symbol information.      If this book had come first, I really think it would have been better received.  It was full of interesting things about Washington D.C. and lots of little known facts, but the story was overshadowed by the similarity of his other books.      Like Michael Crichton, you can't fault his research.  Well done and quite factual, but come on Dan - next time change it up a bit.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This movie is awesome, from the actors to the song choices and everything in between. I love the Beatles and most all of their songs and felt that using the songs to guide a story along just made sense. Although these songs can't replace the originals, some of them are almost just as good. Plus, adding blu-ray to this movie only adds to the quality.
B002GU5V24|4.0|I've been looking forward to this Box Set since it was announced.  I love the bonus tracks on Genesis Live, the complete Rainbow show from 1973, and having the \\"Longs and Shorts\\" sequenced in the original performance order.  There's nothing new or special about Three Sides Live except the remixed and remastered sound.  However, I have a major issue with the \\"glitches\\" on Seconds Out.  When I received my first copy of the box set I sent it back thinking I had defective discs. Today I received my second copy and the exact defects remain on Seconds Out.  This is surely a manufacturers defect and I think everyone who buys this box set should receive a corrected and fixed replacement copy of Seconds Out.  This box set version of Seconds Out is defective and certainly inferior to my previous \\"Definitive Edition Remaster\\" which I foolishly sold when I bought the box set. I will hang on to this box set but I won't be completely happy or satisfied until I get a corrected and replaced copy of Seconds Out.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Cate Blanchett alone makes this movie fantastic.  Her characterization of Queen Elizabeth is genius - every cell in her body becomes the powerful queen.  Cate Blanchett shows Queen Elizabeth's ability to change \\"masks\\" -  The queen who holds court shows her intelligence, strength, ruthlessness, yet has a sense of ironic humor.  The queen in private shows her emotions, love, and fears.  There are threats all around her.<br /><br />Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) appears on the scene and throws his cloak below her feet so she does not step in a puddle.  His dashing ways attract her as someone different from the boring duties of the Court.  He tells of exciting adventures with savages, brings strange exotic items from the New World:  potatoes and tobacco as well as a few Native Americans. her Court.  Sir Walter distracts and intrigues her - makes her weak, she knows her rules  as Queen, yet she needs him near.  He notes that he has named territory after the Virgin Queen \\"Virginia.\\"<br /><br />She wants to focus on her responsibilities instead of personal matters.  Skullduggery and<br />treachery is all around.  There are fights on what religion should be practiced - an Armada that carries the Spanish Inquisition is coming to England to crush out the Protestants and make Catholicism the national religion. She depends on her advisor Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush) to flush out her betrayers.  Her own cousin, Mary Stuart (Samantha Morton) is plotting to have Elizabeth assassinated.<br /><br />Again, Cate Blanchett is riveting as Queen Elizabeth, and the movie revolves around her role.  The movie is excellent and the beautiful costumes, landscapes and sets frame the actress well.
0553573403|5.0|Having been worn out from the regular fantasy fare, I've taken a pretty long siesta from reading most hardcore fantasy. After a while it all tended to blur together, especially the ones that are from big series. After getting this recommended to me umpteen times from my bookstore customers, I gave it a try & was pretty pleased by what I've read.<br /><br />There's so many different reviews for this, I'll not waste space by giving a synopsis. Besides, the plotline for this first book is so richly textured that I doubt I'd have enough room to do anything that would give the book justice. I'll just skip to my personal thoughts about this book.<br /><br />I loved it. It took me a while to get all of the characters down since there are a lot of characters thrown at you at once. A good portion of the book is character introducing & background building, which I will say is completely necessary for the series. Once you've got the characters down, it's not really a hardship to keep up with everything. Each character is pretty memorable & after a while you'll have your favorites in the series. (My personal favorite has to be Tyrion, although Arya is a very close second.) I also love Martin takes great pains to keep everything as historically accurate as possible. Not many authors can or will do this, so seeing someone do this is a treat.<br /><br />My only gripe with the series is that the author takes so freaking long to put the books out... (I'm jonesing for the next book here!)
B000AGTPUK|5.0|All the faith and hope that a child has wrapped up in a beautiful little bell. This is a beautiful book has been brought to life through the magic of animation! We make it a point to watch it every Christmas.   We saw it in 3-d at the Imax theatre when it first came out and it was nothing short of magical!   Although it is not available in this format, (and it would probably loose the effect not being in an actual Imax theatre)The movie still is a wonderful adventure for everyone to enjoy ! Make sure you have your popcorn ready! I bought this movie for all of my Godchildren and this year Hallmark has the bell in their ornament collection! What a wonderful gift to give this Christmas!
0385504225|2.0|The Lost Symbol has elements similar to Brown's previous books: people chasing around deciphering things, supposed disaster looming, a demonic villain, grotesque assaults, etc.  I get the impression he's throwing crumbs to the masses--give them what they want, what they expect: some Brown-type pulp in an automatic best-seller.  He makes a lot of money; I can't fault his financial acumen.  But as writing, as a novel, The Lost Symbol is not good and would not be published if it were by a lesser-known author.  The plot and situations are very implausible, most of the characters are thin cardboard, their actions often illogical.  The pace is sometimes fast, often slow to dead, with annoying repetition and long superfluous passages.  There are loads of breathless descriptions of buildings in Washington, plenty of praise for \\"ancient wisdom\\" and the Masons, but for a quality story and writing one must look elsewhere.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|If you love the movie (or even some of the Beatles songs) then this is just right. I received this as an anniversary gift and have listened to it extensively over the last month. With no comparison to the Beatles, it is a great soundtrack. However, having heard the original songs, some of them are quite different (not necessarily worse, but different) as they tend to be for \\"remakes\\".
B002AWJEU8|5.0|All the other reviews are spot on. I saw a show on this tour and after seeing it I felt I did not need to see any other shows because I was flat out amazed. So 2 years later this comes out and it amazed me again. Steve hit all the right notes and gave his band a lot of camera time and a lot of chances to show thier chops. It's well done from top to bottom. Do not think twice about this purchase. Sound, editing and playing  are all top notch Vai quality. I can't go track by track but some of the many standouts are Building a church, Freakshow excess, Angel Food and Tuarus Bulba. The show is not all intensity.There are some funny moments where Steve is pretty playful and the warmth shows, the bands warmth shows. This will not only blow you away but put a huge grin on your face.  I have not seen all the bonus features yet, but the band interviews so far are enjoyable.
B00111YM5G|3.0|If this movie was linked with religious stories, a reviewer is short of a comment for simply not knowing anything related with/of.<br /><br />\\"Good angels\\" had been converted into \\"dark angels\\" while experiencing realities of a real life in a real city on the Earth-and this conversion brought about illusive personal freedom from subversive existence in a divine paradise.<br /><br />Sex and personal physical superiority are the most such converts exercise.<br /><br />Movie itself is a set of scenes mixing swearing, sci-fi, actions and copulating, where \\"good\\" differs from \\"bad\\" a little, and simply sexy actors play explicitly sexist characters just viewer time to pass by.
B000065U1N|5.0|No actor stands out here; any variation in character or performance is masked by the uniforms, the nature of the action and its consequences on the men. Pretty much what infantry combat is all about, differences merged in a uniform terror, heroism, instinct for self preservation, incredible feats of bravery, and all submerged in the din and smoke of combat. One of the reasons for inequality of rewards for effort is that it is almost impossible to know who is doing what with whose help.  The flavor comes through in the film. Impressive is the fact that it conveys, knowingly, I assume, the confusion, the lack of accurate information, the unpredictability, the disjuncture between the orders of the highest level and the needs for behavior at the lowest levels where death, maiming and psychic distress are the natural outcomes of infantry combat.  If one steps back to look at the larger perspective within which this mission took place, you may form your own opinion about the event, the film, to a remarkable extent does not. Whatever ones broader view of the place this sort of action plays in the life of nations, one should remember that no period of human history has been free of such social behavior while the century just past may have set the record for sheer brutality and certainly did set the record for the number who fell as combatants in war, magnified partly because in modern warfare there is no longer a distinction between military and civilian when it comes to being killed and injured, only a distinction, increasingly blurred, between those who are killed and also kill, and those who are killed but do not kill others directly.

B000LE1GVW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is the real deal! If you are wavering on if you should buy it, buy it! This is the best musician to come out in the past 15 years. His voice is amazing and he uses it to the max. The song writing is old school yet original at the same time. Each song is different yet very good. If your like me where you buy a C.D. and wind up only liking one or two songs, buy this C.D. Every song on here is very good, fresh and original. I also suggest buying his second C.D. \\"Sunny Side Up\\" It is the next step from this one and is very good as well.
0385504225|2.0|I don't read Dan Brown expecting great literature, I thought A&D and the DaVinci Code were very worthy specimens of the thriller genre, but the fatal flaw of The Lost Symbol is that it's as light on thrills as it is on substance.  It's amazing that this meager plot is all Brown could cook up in the 6 years he's had to write this. Perhaps his shtick is just spent after 3 books, but his insertion of esoteric bits of historic trivia into the thriller framework of the book has never felt more clumsy or weighed the story down as much.  A good portion of the book you feel like you're reading paraphrased Wikipedia articles.  This is one of the many reasons the book never quite picks up the page-turning momentum of Brown's earlier novels, and the momentum it does pick up ends up going nowhere. The cryptographic puzzles are simply not very clever or interesting this time around, the climactic bits of action come too soon, and the remainder of the book flounders while the reader wonders if something more is supposed to happen. It doesn't. The whole plot here is implausible, lightweight and phoned-in, with only a couple of effective scenes.  One of the two \\"big reveals\\" here will be figured out by a majority of readers within the first third of the book, the other is will leave you asking \\"is that REALLY all this was all about?\\" Yep.
B00003CXXP|3.0|It is a nice movie of the future of human intelligence and humanity bounodaries.<br /><br />Also rated \\"All ages\\", a work is kid-unsuitable for lovemaking and stone-throwing.
B001O2MBOQ|5.0|This highly under rated film will bring great joy and tears to anyone with a heart. Thoroughly enjoyable, Renée Zellweger is a joy as Beatrix Potter the children's author who has brought joy to countless children over the years. Her drawings and water colours brought to life literally!  Ewan McGregor also gives a good performance but it is Renée Zellweger who makes it magical.   My only wish is that the film was longer to include more of what Beatrix Potter did for the Lake District.     The blu-ray version is worth an investment, picture quality is superb. Unfortunately there seems to be issues of incompatibility within the US. I can tell you that within the EU the disc works fine.
076790592X|5.0|If you have not read this book, you do not know what you are missing. It is a true story of a man dying of ALS disease and how he conquers each fear to the end. Beautifully written because it is straightforward. Nothing fake. Just two guys talking about general topics of life and searching for the answers. I even bought a copy for my mom. Never miss out on a book like this that can give you perspective and teach forgiveness. I loved it. It made me more humble.

B001PR0YFS|4.0|I found the film to be hilarious. I really enjoyed listening to the narrations of all of Whitacre's thoughts: \\"I wonder how much a guy like Bill makes...If you do things like clip your nails in the shower while waiting for your shampoo to set, the time really adds up...\\" Damon does a masterful job coming off as completely unstable and bipolar as Whitacre seemed to be from what I've read and heard.    My only problem with the film was how silly it got at the end, with the strange accusations that Whitacre was making. I agree with others that the film treated this era as somewhat tedious and hard to believe.     For the record, Tony Hale (\\"Buster\\" from Arrested Development) was very funny as Whitacre's attorney. It's awesome to see Tony playing the straight man.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Not his best, but still full of fun, thrills and some interesting info and thought provoking perspectives.
0691142165|4.0|The authors do a good job in demonstrating the highly repetitive,ergodic nature of financial crises over the last 800 hundred years.This book can be regarded as providing additional amounts of  empirical support for the conclusions originally arrived at by Adam Smith in 1776 in his The Wealth of Nations (1776,pp.260-340 of the Modern Library (Cannan) edition with the foreward by Max Lerner) , by J M Keynes in 1936 in chapters 12,17,and 22 of his General Theory and by Kindleberger in his original 1978 book,titled Manias,Panics,and Crashes.Smith, Keynes and Kindleberger all concluded that private banker or financier financed/backed speculation was the major culprit in producing the standard process of a bubble,inflated bubble,mania,panic,crash,and then a recession,depression,or economic downturn.    The authors do acknowledge the role of speculation.However,they appear to be trying to downplay this cause while emphasizing the role of government, as far as apportioning blame for the great economic damages that result from allowing the speculative  process to proceed unhindered.This makes sense only if it is first recognized that private interests often take control of the government regulatory apparatus.Rogoff is a past supporter of the efficient market hypothesis(EMH).The EMH,now completely rejected ,except by economists who have built their academic careers promoting this Ptolomaic type,artificially created,model , essentially concludes that bubbles are not possible.The EMH directly contradicts not only just the historical record of the last 800 hundred years,but of the last 3,500 years where the main source of speculation was in land and precious metals.         A reader,who has read any of the authors mentioned above, will not  learn anything new.However, the additional technical analysis performed by the authors does allow one to conclude that the EMH is simply false,although this conclusion appears self evident from the historical record provided inpast works other than this one.Only economists ,concentrated mainly in the economics and business departments at the University of Chicago,were able to delude themselves into believing that bubbles were impossible.The authors should have recognized the vast empirical work of Benoit Mandelbrot who had proven the EMH false back in the late 1950's-early 1960's.       One criticism of the book is that ,while Kindleberger is covered,neither Keynes,Smith ,or Mandelbrot is adequately acknowledged.Another is that the current ,severe theoretical shortcomings in financial economics should have been at least mentioned in the introduction,footnotes,or conclusion of the book.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|i really enjoyed dan browns other books but this book fell way short.  the location of the lost symbol was obvious and brown spent way too many pages rambling on and on about theological and philosophical issues.
0385504225|5.0|[[ASIN:0385504225 The Lost Symbol]] This is an excellent book and will no doubt sell millions and many will make enquiries into the Craft as a result.  As an active Freemason, I was pleasantly surprised to see Freemasonsry explained in a generally favorable light.  Sure, Dan Brown twists a few things around a bit in order to make for a gripping story that truly is a page-turner that is very difficult to put down once you start reading it. Freemasons at all levels should buy and read this book and be prepared for lots of enquiries as a result.
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|I'm sure that most people know the story.  Leonard Cohen was retired and living in a monastery only to learn that he had no money through the machinations of his business manager.  So out of the monastery and onto the road to restore his finances.  I'm sorry for Leonard Cohen that he was forced to do something that he preferred not to, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn't delighted that he went out on one long, perhaps final tour.  I got the CD version of this concert a day or so after it was released, but for some reason until now I did not get around to seeing the DVD version.  Musically there were no great revelations.  I already knew these performances very, very well.  But nonetheless it was delightful to see Cohen onstage.  On the album he sounded so amazingly charming; on the DVD he was if anything even more charming.  The one real surprise was seeing precisely how fragile he looked.  Not ill or sick or even especially old, just smaller and more fragile than I anticipated.<br /><br />There is a great moment in one of the original Beavis and Butthead cartoons.  They are watching a Johnny Cash video when one of them, I forget who, says, \\"Old people are cool.\\"  I hope to god when I'm Leonard Cohen's age that I'm even a twentieth as cool as he is.  Both in this performance and in hearing him interviewed on Fresh Air with Terry Gross I was struck by how at peace he seems.  He seems to be a man with few regrets and if bitter about having to come out of retirement, he certainly doesn't show it.  As someone who is aging more than I'd like, I can really appreciate some of his best songs about growing older.  \\"I ache in the places where I used to play.\\"  Trust me, I get that line.<br /><br />The sound was good on this DVD, but I somewhat regret that the picture was 4:3 resolution instead of widescreen.  But those are minor complaints.  This is a wonderful record of one of the greatest songwriters of the past half century.  Cohen hasn't been as prolific as Bob Dylan, and he hasn't written as many great songs as Bob (thoug, who has?), but his very best songs can withstand comparison with the very best songs of anyone.  And if the tour he is currently wrapping up truly is his final one, at least we have this DVD and the CD soundtrack to remember him by.  But who knows.  Perhaps he will decide he had so much fun that he'll go back on the road to celebrate turning eighty.  If not, we love you Leonard!hasn't written as many great songs as Bob (thoug, who has?), but his very best songs can withstand comparison with the very best songs of anyone.

B0006GVJEE|3.0|Leon the Professional is a very well-made European-style movie with heart-warming and heart-rending moments along with some gruesome, graphic violence. The original director's cut, which is the European version, was edited for American audiences who might find some scenes \\"unsavory\\" regarding Mathilda's childish crush on Leon. But overall the film is a rough story of a man who learns to feel again, and a little girl who learns the harsh realities of that chaos they call life. Gary Oldman's performance of the psychotic DEA agent is reminiscent of his character in The Fifth Element. Pretty decent watching. The only unfortunate disappointment to the movie is the watered-down depiction of the SWAT team deployed to Leon's apartment in the final scenes, in which they resemble ski-masked bank robbers more than the helmeted thuggish cops they actually are.

B002GJT4Y6|3.0|This is a fun movie even though it suffers from some of the vices of the first movie in the series and not participating in the virtues of the subsequent films.<br /><br />There are some things that are better in this film than the first. In particular, Daniel Radcliffe evidences enormous improvement as an actor. And because there is less set up in this one than in the first film, they are able to delve more directly into storytelling. And as in the first film, Hogwarts is rendered memorably. Still, the film is in many ways a disappointment. Chris Columbus's direction was as weak in the second as in the first and either he or the film's editor had to take responsibility for the terrible pacing in many of the film's scenes. On every level, all subsequent films would be better directed and edited. One might quibble over the script, but not the direction and editing. Future films would not drag in individual scenes like in this one.<br /><br />I do, however, have a lot of problem with the script for this film. Any adaptation of a novel by a movie has to make compromises. Still, ultimately the script has to function as an independent entity. The problem here was the abrupt and inelegant shifts from one scene to another, with no foreshadowing of what would come later or thematic repetition. Few parts of the screenplay resonate with other parts of the screenplay. Now, this very possibly is not the fault of the screenwriter. Directors and editors can radically alter screenplays during the course of filming. so unless we could see the original screenplay and to what degree it was preserved in the filming it is hard to blame the screenwriter. We blame the director. If what was filmed was the writer produced, a writer should have been brought in to fix it. I suspect that the director made changes. Who can say for sure. But one thing is for sure: the film has almost no narrative flow. And as an adaptation of a novel is does a poor job of maintaining its key themes.<br /><br />Luckily, the movies got much, much better. THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is by any standard a great film, the best directed film in the series, while the later films were buoyed by very substantive stories. The movies are not nearly as good as the books. That is pretty much par for the course. There have been very, very few movies in the history of film that were better than the novels upon which they were based, except in cases where the novels were not very to begin with.<br /><br />One of the more humorous sidelights of the film was that some Russians took offense at the film, imagining that the elf Dobby was intended to look like Vladimir Putin. Some Russian lawyers for a while even contemplated taking legal action. There appears to be little justification for such an action. Whatever resemblance between Dobby and Putin would be strictly physical and Dobby in no other way would appear to refer to Putin. I personally think the easily offended lawyers needed to bash their heads a few times on their desks as penance for their silliness.ot much, much better.

B002JM1VJG|1.0|I think that many things regarding the bad video and audio quality have been said about this new release, but there's something else I noticed that made me feel more that disappointed about Warner Bros company, It's not just that they didn't care about the final product that we were going to receive as customers, but they also included wrong information after the ending of a song of the DVD that was part of a movie soundtrack, just after Crazy For You there's a screen saying that the song was taken from the movie Vision Quest that is available in DVD and BLU RAY, which is not true, the blu ray doesn't exist!!!! the same for Who's That Girl!!! Anyway, I was expecting this Celebration DVD on Blu Ray, since we all live in the age of technology and we are expecting a new compilation of a megastar such MADONNA, I guess that it is not possible that other low rate artists have their videos and concerts on this latest format and the Queen of pop hasn't had them yet?<br /><br />It was a real shame for WB and for the Madonna's Crew that passed this material before it was released.
B00003CX9W|3.0|Great movie but hard to get kids to watch, especially with the band narrations at the beginning of each skit....
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I was going to really pan WANTED until I learned it is based on a comic (or graphic novel, or whatever they call them these days).  So that explains all the utter gravity-defying nonsense and stupidity.  Thing is, this film really had me hooked as James McAvoy narrates over images of his ho-hum life as a Chicago accountant with a surly girlfriend, a backstabbing best bud, and a size XXXXXL boss who likes to snap a stapler in people's faces.  Yeah, perfectly dreadful, and McAvoy delivers with a tongue-in-cheek \\"whoa is me\\" style that had me craving to know more. . .until Angelina Jolie swoops in like a cartoon character and this flick loses rational control faster than flatulence at a bean diner.<br /><br />Turns out McAvoy's character is the son of the Ultimate Assassin, member of a proud \\"fraternity\\" of assassins presided over by a smug Morgan Freeman--the same Freeman who doubles during the day as an executive for a textile factory (in a castle, of course) sporting a meat locker (no, I'm not making any of this up, trust me).  McAvoy's father has just been killed--and his killer is now tracking McAvoy (egads!).  Or is he?  Or do we care?  So McAvoy decides he's had enough living as a doormat and will fulfill his destiny by following in his father's footsteps.  His training is laughable, but is supervised by a dour Jolie who every once in awhile at least gives us the courtesy of taking off her clothes.  Then out into the world McAvoy's character goes, bending bullets with his mind and leaping trains and ledges and whatnot like you and I stepping onto a curb.  There's a circle-of-death kill scene as climax that had me laughing uncontrollably, but in truth, the special effects are fun to watch, the gore is really gory, and Angelina would look good wearing army boots reading a phone book, so WANTED is worth a look-see.  Laugh early, laugh often.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I love these headphones they have great quality and you can now play both headphones and your home theater speakers at the same time(with the new update). However, I noticed that the headphones feel very light and cheap, but nevertheless they are great. Maybe it was just me, but, within the first week of use the clip on the back of the anpilifier snapped off, but its really not that big of a deal. Otherwise, this product is great!
B002C1BHIO|5.0|Kudos to Amazon for entering the cable market and doing it right. This is a very well constructed cable with a nice braided sleeve. The packaging can be opened without tools though the double boxing for shipping seems excessive. Other vendors sell similar products for a similar price but none of them have Amazon's great website, easy ordering process and excellent customer service. I will be buying my cables from Amazon in the future.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I have loved Snow White since I was a little girl and have been looking forward to sharing this movie with my soon to be 3year old daughter. What a perfect time for this edition to come out. It is so great, the colors and details are so clear and rich, while maintaining the integrity of this classic film. I can't say enough good things about it and consider myself very lucky to have been chosen to receive a sneek peek for this movie. This is a perfect movie for the young and the young at heart. Go ahead and buy it, you won't regret. It is well worth the money, just the movie alone, but all the extras make it even better. I heartily give it two thumbs up.

0307455874|5.0|I saw some people leaving negative reviews because they read this book wanting to know more about \\"where Obama came from\\". This is not that book - while it does include anecdotes from his life, it's about his ideas.    That said... the man speaks sense. His book is incredibly thoughtful and levelheaded and, well, sensible. He talks about poverty, morality, race, and other issues in a way that doesn't seek to lay the blame on one group of people - rather he acknowledges things that both sides have done to hamper progress, and how partisan attitudes and people's unwillingness to see the other's viewpoint have led us to an inability to compromise. In the chapter about race, he discusses the reluctance on the part of many white Americans' to support policy intended to help minorities (and he *doesn't* attribute this unwillingness to nothing more than racism.)    He does about the same thing with every other issue he covers in the book - addresses the causes and then lays out some ideas for how to help alleviate the problem. He never goes into exacting detail, but he does recognize the importance of approaching problems and finding solutions without letting partisan feelings cloud one's judgment - you can't just say that \\"this is a bad idea because (the opposing party) supports it.\\"    And on top of that, he's just a good writer. The \\"policy-discussion\\" parts are divided up with relevant anecdotes from his life and political career - for example, he opens up the chapter about race with a short vignette of Rosa Parks' funeral, which he attended. In the chapter entitled \\"Opportunity\\" he talks about sponsored a proposal which would have ended the practice of letting senators fly on private jets for the cost of a first-class plane ticket, and how he decided to stop flying on private jets after the measure failed.    This segued into an anecdote about his first flight around the country afterwards - he admits that while his self-imposed ban was the right thing to do, the tripwasn't so enjoyable (\\"The traffic to O'Hare was terrible. When I got there, the flight to Memphis had been delayed. A kid spilled orange juice on my shoe.\\") But in the very next paragraph he tells about a man he met while waiting in line who told him that he \\"hoped Congress would do something about stem-cell research this year.\\" The guy explained that he had early-stage Parkinson's disease and a three-year-old son who he would probably never get to play ball with because of his condition. The guy said that while it was probably too late for him, it wasn't too late to keep people in the future from going through the things he was going through. Obama ends this part with the line \\"These are the stories you miss, I thought to myself, when you fly on a private jet.\\" These little detours make the whole thing much more readable that it would have been as a book that was 100% about politics and policy. Overall, it's an excellent read - and if you have the means to buy it, borrow it, or read it in the bookstore on the sly, I would highly recommend that you do so.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series....I got it on the recommendation from a friend and I am impressed.  (That my friend actually had a good suggestion!)  It would be great if they would revive the series.
0385504225|1.0|I loved the DaVinci code. As preposterous as the plot was, the people in the story behaved in normal ways. In the Lost Symbol however, at the end the characters behave not like they had just been put through hell by a maniac but like they were trying to one-up each other with lectures. Of course, Brown had to do this to get his lessons out into the book through dialog, but seriously. You've just been through hell, both physically and mentally, and instead of going to a hospital you go on a sight-seeing tour of D.C.? Come on!    This book was a great page turner up to a point. But when I found out what the \\"national security\\" matter was, I was appalled. Brown really thinks people would care about that so much that it was worth the CIA's time to protect? Really? It's as though Brown just couldn't think of anything better. Everything after the climactic events with the villain was horrible, it felt like Brown was preaching. And I have yet to figure out why the pyramid needed to be protected when the secret was something the world already knows.    I will not be reading anything by this author in the future.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|This album is not amazing, but to hear Whitney's voice again and the few songs that are really good, the CD is worth it! I just love Whitney in general, so I'm happy that she is back and glad to support her! On some of the songs, her voice is disappointing, but on songs like \\"I look to you\\" and \\"I didn't know my own strength\\", you can hear the nuances of the once superstar Whitney Houston! Overall good record for a comeback after so long away from the recording studio!
B000IZJ1J8|5.0|Electric Wizard have become an iconic name these days upon metal, and with \\"Dopethrone\\", it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The whole vibe crafted by this album is enough to send you into a daze; the use of drugs is not mandatory. The guitars are the shining stars on this album, in which they are aggressive yet slow and heavy enough to give off a sense of psychedelia throughout. If you want riffs, Dopethrone is packed with them. Like I said before, they're slow, sludgy and trippy enough to send you to another dimension. Vocalist Jus Oborn has his vocals pretty low in the mix, which wasn't uncommon with their [[ASIN:B000IZJ1IY Come My Fanatics...]], but this is definitely not a problem when you pay attention to the guitars and the contributing drumming and bass work. If anything, his vocals are mixed around the right area, where he contributes to the instrumental vibe yet doesn't hinder it at all.<br /><br />This is highly recommended for anybody that appreciates the glory days of Sabbath, crushing riffs, tripping out, or just appreciates some good metal in their lives. Essential.<br /><br />Score: 9.6/10
0385504225|3.0|This is a pretty good book. Follows a formula similar to his other books for fast-paced, takes-place-in-one-day material. It is a light and easy read, and entertaining to be toured around one of my favorite cities, Washington DC. There are no fatal flaws, however, there are several times when the antagonist and his history seems contrived, the historical relationship between this person and the person he kidnaps (trying not to reveal any spoilers) is underdeveloped in comparison to the high degree of psychotic dysfunction that characterizes his relationship with this person; all of which lead to a substantial imbalance in the climax of the story. At the same time, the primary protagonist - our old friend Robert Langdon - seems shallower and less robust that in prior portrayals, and at times uncharacteristically dense in the face of some of the symbology being revealed to him, during which time the reader is left with the impression that Langdon is a dolt, unable to figure any of this out himself. To this end, the story overall is fine and makes for an entertaining read, but the climax and conclusion of the book are dissatisfying, falling squarely in the shadow of the first 400 pages of the book. Still, I recommend it is a good weekend read.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I know not to listen to a new album expecting to hear the same album as before.

Another solid, unique album worth my time and money. Thanks, Depeche.

B000001FFJ|5.0|I remember buying this for myself on my 21st birthday. It didn't leave my cassette player for 3 weeks. That was 18 years ago.  I would still, and probably always will, rank this in the top 10 albums ever made.  It's hard to imagine another album as diverse and creative as this.  I've tried to introduce others to this masterpiece over the years, with only one real success that I can recall.  Most just return the disc (of course, I replaced the tape eventually) and look at me like I have 3 heads.  That this is a work of genius there can be no doubt, but it is certainly an acquired taste.
0545123267|3.0|A shiver is passing, fleeting. You begin to feel a slight sensation whether it be from the cold, or fear, and then you shiver in apprehension.    This book is no different. It has moments of pure genious that leave with an amazing sensation, only to have that sensation vanish when you muddle over the plot holes and lack of character development.    First off, the good parts of Shiver:  The main characters are brilliantly portrayed. Both Grace and Sam are likable, even lovable at times. And the reader truly does care what happens to them, and hpes their love will survive.  Second, the changing of the way werewolfism works is creative(to a point, but more on that later)  Nothing screams tension like having to keep a romance going but watch exposure to the outdoors, it's almost as if Maggie Stiefvater was relying heavily on some of the old fairy tale plot devices, where the main character is transformed by exposure to the sun, etc.  Finally, it's about wolves. Wolves rock, and the way they are portrayed in this story is pretty unique compared to some other stories I've read.    Now on to the bad news:    Sadly, despite the fact that Stiefvater took insane amounts of time to develop Grace and Sam, she seems to have glazed over everyone else. Grace's friends seem weird, Her parents are total morons, Sam's pack is nonexistant and their motives unclear. It's almost as if she was too focused on Sam and Grace and forgot the other characters existed...except when she uses them as victims (SPOILER: the death of one of the secondary characters is too quick to be anything but lazy.)  The other problem is, while I thought the idea of cold turning the humans into wolves was a creative twist, it's ruined by the fact that there seems to be no set standard for what does it. I also found it weird that they didn't know what caused werewolfism, but they absolutely knew that there was no cure...that's just confusing.   Finally, I'm told that there will be a sequal...but the ending makesit seem unlikely, it's too final.     In the end, this is not a bad novel, but a rough one. It has a lot of good moments, but is plauged by a lack of secondary character development and a confusing plot device.  However, if there is indeed a sequal, I will certainly read it, I hope by then Stiefvater will have ironed out the details that need correcting.
1594488878|5.0|Rhapsodizing about the Shins' song, \\"New Slang,\\" Natalie Portman begs Zach Braff in the movie Garden State, \\"You gotta listen to it. It'll change your life.\\" Portman's character would feel perfectly at home in Nick Hornby's sixth novel, a fetching story about the power of music, the folly of celebrity fandom, and the perils of celebrity itself. Hornby offers up an appealing set of \\"Hornbyesque\\" characters, as frustrating as they are likable in their struggles to navigate the shoals of ordinary life.    There was a time when a novel that brought together two people living in a dreary English seaside town and a mostly forgotten American rock star would have been too farfetched to pull off. Enter the Internet, and Duncan Thomson, obsessed fan of Tucker Crowe, a singer/songwriter in the mold of Dylan, Springsteen and Leonard Cohen, whose career ended mysteriously when he stepped out of the bathroom of a tiny Minneapolis club in 1986. Duncan, a college teacher in Gooleness (its name devastatingly conveys the town's desperate ordinariness), runs a website devoted to dissecting Crowe's work with the intensity of a Talmudic scholar. As the novel opens, Duncan and his girlfriend, Annie Platt, are in the midst of a three-week odyssey across the United States dedicated to visiting the iconic sites in Crowe's life and career.    If Duncan had devoted as much effort to his 15-year relationship with Annie as he has to obsessing over Crowe's oeuvre, her attention might not be so concentrated on the swift passage of time and the rapidly fading chance she'll bear a child as she reaches her 40th birthday. \\"What hadn't she done because she'd spent too much time with a boring, faithless nerd,\\" Annie muses, \\"apart from living the kind of life she'd wanted when she was twenty-five?\\" Annie is the curator of the Gooleness Seaside Museum, charged with mounting an exhibit to commemorate the highlights of the summer of 1964, when a new band --- the Rolling Stones --- performed in the town anda shark washed up on the beach. Her therapist (she's his only patient) wants to date her, and a \\"northern soul\\" dancer from a neighboring town begs her to sleep with him. One of Hornby's signal achievements in the novel lies in making her mingled frustration and anger palpable.    Annie and Duncan's static existence is disturbed when Duncan receives a CD containing acoustic versions of the 10 songs on Crowe's \\"legendary\\" breakup album, Juliet. Dubbed Juliet, Naked, the disc quickly wins Duncan's ecstatic praise, but Annie's decision to post her challenge to her companion's adoring review serves as a tacit declaration of independence that brings their foundering relationship to an end in a breakup scene that is laced with brittle humor and pathos: \\"They made it hard for you to jump off bridges, or to smoke, to own a gun, to become a gynecologist. So how come they let you walk out on a stable, functioning relationship?\\"    Annie's boldness attracts the attention of an unlikely email correspondent --- Tucker Crowe --- who shares her own dim view of the work and, like her, is burdened by the need to reclaim a huge swath of lost time. After his disappearance from the music scene for 22 years, he has succeeded only at squandering the talent he briefly displayed and at inflicting misery on those who find themselves in his orbit. \\"So stopping had been a very smart career move --- provided, that is, you ignored the lack of a career that was the inevitable consequence.\\" Father to five children with four mothers, he lives in a small town in central Pennsylvania with his six-year-old son, Jackson, and his most recent wife, who is about to divorce him. When his pregnant daughter in London loses her baby, Tucker and Jackson head for England and what will turn out to be his rendezvous with Annie. What he doesn't expect, in the process, is a health scare and a reunion with (most of) his widely-scattered exes and their offspring. And soon, Annie and Tucker are circling each other warily, heading toward a resolution that is satisfying in its unpredictability.    No popular novelist working today is as generous to his creations as Nick Hornby, and it's that talent that makes it easy to see ourselves in the wistful, quietly desperate lives of these characters. Almost without effort, Annie helps the men in her life --- celebrity (however minor) and devoted fan --- experience something that looks suspiciously like growth. And in accomplishing that, she finds herself changed in unexpected ways. \\"For the best part of forty years she had genuinely believed that not doing things would somehow prevent regret, when, of course, the exact opposite was true. Her youth was over, but there might be some life left in life yet.\\" There's ample life in this charming novel, an openhearted, witty take on how starting in the middle can feel like a new beginning.        --- Reviewed by Harvey Freedenberg
B000003N89|4.0|Very nice cd. Excellent sound quality. Part of my dinner party collection by the way...
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Despite the haters, this is easily the most iconic and impressive video collection since Michael Jackson released his.  You get 47 videos here across 2 DVD's.  I think it was unusually generous to include 11 videos for songs that weren't on the Celebration album!  True, like the album there are some songs conspicuously absent (most painfully obvious is \\"American Life\\"), but this set will not disappoint...too much...more on that later.    The video quality, for the most part, is good.  I played it on a PlayStation 3 (upscaling via HDMI) on a 40\\" Sony Bravia XBR HDTV.  With the exception of a 4 or 5 videos on disc 2, the video looked really good and I noticed no pixelation.  The sound options on the DVD include 5.1 surround, but that's a joke.  Still, even though it's just a slightly enhanced stereo mix, it's very clear and I have no complaints.    As far as content, there are some fantastic moments here.  For the first time on home video, we're treated to videos such as \\"Into the Groove\\", \\"Crazy for You\\", \\"Who's That Girl\\", \\"Erotica\\", \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", \\"I Want You\\", \\"You'll See\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" among others.  Plus, we get a video for \\"Miles Away\\" that has been released and practically never seen before, and we get the video for \\"Celebration\\".  Also, \\"Get Together\\" is included, but it's the alternate version, which is nice to see.  One glaring drawback is that the \\"Justify My Love\\" video does not feature any new footage despite what the DVD label says, and it does edit one scene (it shows black bars blocking a woman's breasts).  Not sure why they did that, but it's not cool.  Black bars are also present on the last scene of the \\"Erotica\\" video, but that's the way it's always been shown.    All in all, this is well worth it despite it's one or two flaws.  You will never get a more impressive collection of truly groundbreaking videos ever.  Madonna has truly revolutionized the music video medium and it certainly shows here.  Fans of Madonna should not pass this up.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I listened to it yesterday and all the songs are nice.  It's still Paramore.  They still have the same sound and they have produced a nice variety of songs.  Sure I like Riot better, but I think Riot is one of the top rock albums of the decade.  Paramore has done a nice job with this new CD, and I think it's better than their first CD, All We Know Is Falling.  I listened to it for hours in my car, and it was very enjoyable.  I'll be listening to it many more times in the future.    BTW, I got confused reading these reviews that critique every song.  Just pop it in your CD player, put it on random, and enjoy it.  I did not hear any bad songs on this CD.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|There is no doubt this is an experimental album, and that the dynamic of the band has changed a bit.  But people who are not fans of mainstream music will DEFINITELY enjoy this album.  This is a rock album, and this IS Alice in Chains.  William Duvall's vocals melt in perfectly with Cantrell's.  He's not Layne, but then again David Gilmour wasn't Syd Barrett, and they created some great music together.      Besides one track that I could live without, this is a fine offering from Alice in Chains.  Starved for 13 years without new material, you hunger for the songs on this album. Don't expect it to sound like Dirt, this is an ongoing evolution, of a very evolving band.  The album is great.

B00004YRQA|5.0|Fake Sony 8MB PS2 cards can be found for much less than the too-expensive legit Sony-made versions.  However, saved game corruption are significant, and build quality is very poor.  I bought one Sony-made 8MB memory off Amazon through a 3rd party, presuming it was a real Sony-made item.  Yes, it was 1/4 the price of the real thing, but some games didn't even recognize it or simply gave corrupted saves 100% of the time (such as MGS3 Subsistence), while others didn't seem to care (such as MGS2 Substance).<br /><br />The card rattled, too, due to a lose board inside the case.  It didn't fit smoothly into the PS2's memory slot, either.  Spelling errors on the back was my first indication it was fake, but comparing it to a known legit Sony card, it was quite obvious.<br /><br />So, be careful.  Those 'new, sealed in package' deals from non-Amazon vendors through the Amazon website just might not be the real thing (you've been warned!).

It has same theme as his other two sucessful books ..but must agree have a different twist . His combining of both Noetic sceiences and masons ancient mystery  is similar to what he tried to do in Angels and Demons . But the ending was very good ..instead of showing a treasure a.k.a National treasure movie the ending has some meaning which all the people can grasp . Overall loved the book not at all disappointed unlike many ... Looking forward to the movie !!!
B0002ADY0Q|4.0|I purchased the original Salisbury Vinyl Album at a PX in Korea; while in the military. I held on to the album for years until losing my home to a fire. I am a HUGE Uriah Heep fan and saw them live 7 times. Over the years I had replaced some of my Heep albums with CDs; but never really searched out Salisbury.  For some reason, the album popped into my head and I just went nuts craving it. The title song \\"Salisbury\\" is a masterpiece, showing the individual talents of each member in the group. I will cherrish this CD forever.  I thoroughly enjoy listening to it every time I drive somewhere in my car.  If you are a HEEP fan; I highly recommend this one.  It is one of their best.

0385504225|2.0|First, let me say that I LOVED Angels and Demons, and The Da Vinci Code.  However, I was so disappointed in this book.  It started off at a very slow rate.  I mean really, how many times do you have to describe how crazy the antagonist is, I get it already! It did pick up about 25% of the way in, but slowed again at the ending.  The ending was disappointing and the neuro science explanations I skimmed over, it seemed (to me) that all of that could have been shortened as well.  Grade = C
B00005TQKQ|4.0|I had an 8mm digital camcorder I thought was a goner.  It had refuesed to play any tapes until I bought this reidiculously overpriced cleaning cassette.  I have to say - it worked like a charm.  The camera had refused to play antyhing until I ran the cleaning cassette on it.  the other camcorder I have was not so lucky.  It still skips frames and appears to have more video head damage.  It wouldn't play the cleaner tape at all.  I guess I'll have ot wsend it in for repairs.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|A lot has been written and uttered about the release of these new re-masters of the entire catalogue by The Beatles.    I will certainly not do any vain attempt as to review their music, because who can deny the sole and pure genius of The Beatles, whose efforts change the face of pop and rock music, beyond anything ever attempted before. John Lennon and Paul McCartney's songs are already immortalized and George Harrison's contribution is also a vital one (Something, Here Comes The Sun - etc.), and not to forget; Ringo's great drumming (an overly underrated drummer who delivered just the right great idea or groove that fitted so nicely) - because what people seem to completely have missed out, when they start single out John Lennon over Paul McCartney - the most common mistake in my opinion - is that they fore and most were a group. It was the chemistry between these four guys, and especially the sound competition between McCartney and Lennon that was the essential core of The Beatles - enough said already.    To the actual point: the re-masters:    1) The guys at EMI has done a great job and I don't think, limited with the original two track master tapes on hand, that anyone could've done a better job - it sounds quite warm and still crispy with good headroom and dynamics. And on top of that it also sounds clearer with less noise - not so bad uhhh!    2) So what is the difference between the old CD releases from 1887??? - Well, of course there is a difference with the newer technology on hand, but not to disappoint anybody - the difference is not that great, and you won't be able to notice that much improvement in the sound, except if you have a really good stereo system. Thinking about the limited digital technology George Martin had in '87, he really did a marvellous job back then.  Well I do actually have a great stereo and can of course hear the difference, and it is a pleasant and welcoming one, but it is not a revelation. So if you have just a reasonable consumer stereo, and have no plans of investing in a better one, don't waste your money!    3) So in my opinion what could have been done instead, Well EMI choose to release the material as it sounded original, when mixed in the heydays of the sixties, although knowing that stereo back then wasn't first priority - that was mono! It is interesting though that just two years earlier (2007) they released the compilation CD \\"Yellow Submarine\\", and this outlet featured remixes of the original masters, and that sounds GREAT!!! It isn't anything like that they have made any changes to it per se, - no, they have just, ever so gently improved the sound, making better panning and balance, and here you really hears and feels a great difference. Just one good example is the song Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. On the original mix the whole band is tilted over to the right channel for most of the beginning, and McCartney's lead vocal is a bit low... on the EMI staffs \\"Yellow Submarine\\" remix, the balance is much better, and the lead vocal stands out with a nice presence. It just sounds much more natural.    4) So well where do that leaves us? - Well I personally believe that they should had left this great task in the hands of the same guys (Peter Cobbin, Paul Hicks, etc.) who did the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" job and then the result would have been a revelation, (especially on the mixes from 1962-1967) - \\"Yellow Submarine\\" proves that. A good example is the two CD remixes of The Who's Tommy and Who's Next - what an improvement!!!    5) This is a subject that often divides people; should the thing be preserved exactly as it was originally, or could it be looked at with new fresh eyes...? When they reissued the original Fender Stratocasters, not a bad idea in itself, they did it so carefully that they kept the adjustment knob at the end of the fingerboard, which mean that you have to remove the whole pickguard to adjust the guitar - who can hear the difference in the sound if the adjustment knob were placed in the headstock instead, where it can be easily accessed - the only right place to put it - no one, because there isn't any. Obvious \\"mistakes\\" from the past should be corrected, I believe, and that doesn't take anything away from the original intentions - just on the contrary.
0385504225|4.0|Over all, this was a good book; especially if you are wanting something to pass the time.  The Lost Symbol did seem to parallel the DaVinci Code pattern; searching for a lost 'treasure', secret society, government involvement, fanatical henchman, etc.  I would not expect this to be the world wide phenomenon that the DaVinci Code was.
B0000AFQRZ|5.0|I am not exactly a big fan of the Who, but I do enjoy their music.  In fact my first introduction to their music was in high school visiting a friend, smoking a joint, and listening to this totally bitchen album, Who's Next.  I've heard songs on the radio of earlier releases, but once Baba O'Riley hit my speakers it was captivating. This DVD was an eye opener for me.  I once worked in a print shop in Hollywood and had done some litho work for The Kids Are Alright tour.  It would be a few years later before I actually saw the Who live at the LA Colliseum with Living Color as their opening act.  The pacing of this DVD is quick and sure footed.  Would liked to have seen more of Keith Moon, who in my opinion was the driving force behind the Who music.  But mostly to learn more of the connection Keith had with Pete Townsend.  This DVD is well worth the price for all you diletante Who fans.  And an extremely worthy item to have in any diehard Who fanatic's collection.
B00000G6PJ|5.0|This is a review of the cd with the yellow cover and the track listing in the correct order on the back. I have seen versions of this album with either a green cover or the track listing randomised on the back, all over the place. Not sure which version sounds best, but I am quite happy with this one.  The sound quality on this album is quite good, but it sort of sounds like it's all coming from middle distance. E.g. on The Ramones self-titled debut, the vocals and drums, I think, were up front, but the guitars were background, which was annoying. Here, it's all middle...would have been nice to have it all upfront.        Recently I bought this album for the first time on cd, after formerly owning the cassette.  This was because recently I've been exploring the origins of punk and I wanted to revisit the album that a novice like me would have thought of as the FIRST punk album.  That misconception has been cleared up in the meantime (see my reviews just prior to this one...The Damned released the first punk album in the UK, and The Saints in Australia and Ramones in the US also predated British punk with their debuts).  Anyway, my general impression of this album was that it had two of the greatest songs of all time on it and...not much else, really.  On first listen I was inclined to give this cd 85/100 just for the strength of those two songs, which NO punk band has matched on debut, and nearly otherwise (The Saints' \\"Know your product\\" would be my pick as the greatest punk song of all time, but the two best songs on this album are not that far behind it...they're all classics, in any case).  On second listen I found more to like about this album, which I'll got into shortly.       As for The Sex Pistols, their brand of punk was not so much a shot across the bow of The Establishment in Britain as it was a cannonball in the hull.  Whereas America's Ramones were pretty much urban degenerates (in tone) who moved in the demi-monde, and Australia's Saints were rebellious boys from the suburbs, The Sex Pistols were different in that they explicitly challenged The Establishment in their lyrics. It's laughable now, but The Establishment actually believed that The Sex Pistols were a threat to the 'natural' order and they were stymied wherever they popped their heads up. See the great documentary on this band \\"The filth and the fury\\", which notes how British newspapers blacked out the band's entries in the chart, even though they were top 10, if not #1.        Not being a student of this band, I can't say whether they actually believed their own publicity/posturing.  They did have the unfortunate effect of side-lining REAL punks like The Saints, whose do-it-yourself ethos is still an inspirational example to would be musicians.  The Sex Pistols' brand of punk required the corporate 'uniform' of safety pins and ripped designer clothes. An image which The Saints were too anarchistic to blindly follow.  They fell off the radar as a result...they weren't 'real' punk by the new standard...all style and posturing.  As for that posturing...anarchy...revolution...did anyone ever really take that seriously? In my soundtrack to \\"The great rock'n'roll swindle\\", there is some artwork which shows The Sex Pistols' Sid Vicious with Nazi paraphernalia. Now, what kind of dunce thinks that anarchy and fascism are even remotely compatible?  When The Sex Pistols' Johnny Rotten said at the end of a US concert \\"You ever get the feeling that you've been had?\\" I get the feeling that he was really asking himself that question, and not the audience, if the implication for the latter was that the audience had been had.       Back to the album...it's more interesting with the 'lesser' track the second time around, and the drumming is interesting too. It was an episode of \\"Classic Albums\\", I think, which revealed to me that their guitarist, Steve Jones, actually performed the bass guitar parts on it, after their 'manager' Malcolm McLaren's Machiavellian manoeuvring had seen original bassist Glen Matlock kicked out by Johnny Rotten, to be replaced by Sid Vicious who looked the part of a punk bass guitarist without actually been competent on the bass part of that equation.      The immortal songs:      God save the Queen - a good riff and excellent, military style drumming, I think.  A bleak song with the refrain \\"Nooooo future\\". Nihilism incarnate.   In fact, this song has more than its fair share of philosophically interesting lyrics and insightful observations: \\"When there's no future there cannot be sin\\" and \\"God save the Queen because tourists are money\\".  The opening track also comments on tourism of a different sort.  For an establishment which took the 'threat' from this band seriously, the lyric \\"We're the future,  your future\\" must have seemed revolutionary.  The guitar solo in this song is pure 1950s, I think.    Anarchy in the U.K. -  with the iconic intro, this song swings and has a terrific, laddish singalong quality to it.  The fuzzy electric guitars in this song recall Led Zeppelin to a certain extent.  There is a terrific guitar break in this song which leads into some hand claps. The guitar solo in this song is cool too.  Rotten gives a self-defining vocal performance here.      Songs I liked better on second listen:      Holidays in the sun - the opening track.  Begins with the sound of marching boots. Has a good riff, bass, and a 1950s style lead guitar.  Drummer Paul Cook begins this album with one of his many interesting beats on this album.  The best part of this track are the backing vocals, I think. Lyrics include something about \\"New Belsen\\", which is reference to The Holocaust. Don't know too much about this band's 'philosophy' on such matters, apart from that drawing of Vicious' Nazi paraphernalia on that soundtrack album I mentioned earlier. American punk band The Dead Kennedys released a song which told Nazi punks where to go, exactly. Perhaps the 'marriage' of punk and Nazism had its origins with The Sex Pistols too? This is the song which also demonstrates Rotten's insight into tourism and the social order.     New York -  this is a song which came out of nowhere for me. Hadn't even noted it first listen, like with Holidays, but the second listen a few days later just gave this song an appeal I hadn't noticed before.  Having checked out an album by The Heartbreakers, I found out this song was an attack on one of The Heartbreakers' former bands, The New York Dolls. It's quite caustic in dealing with the Dolls.  Johnny Thunders, that Doll and Heartbreaker, got his reply in on the excellent \\"L.A.M.F\\" album track \\"London boys\\", which was quite powerful in its turn. Don't know enough about Rotten, but Thunders really pulls a rock up and shine a light on Rotten.  Perhaps both got what they deserved in those song.  Anyway, this is a rock song with a nasty sounding riff. The lead guitar outro is very  good and 1950s style.  This song could be another instance of Rotten taking the high moral ground...in this case, to do with the Dolls' drug taking.  But Rotten seems incapable of taking the high moral ground and applying a civil form address at the same time...he gets quite nasty in this song.      Not bad:      Submission - slower tempo song with a groovy riff to it.  Not sure if you hear Rotten making kissing noises on this song or if that is a synthesiser...colourful in any case.  On second listen I discovered a brief and unexpected melody at 1:38 into the song, which I quite liked and would have been a good part to have expanded on...but maybe for a more pop inclined band.  Track has a buzzing guitar sound to it. Rotten's cough at the end brought to mind Black Sabbath's song \\"Sweet leaf\\" and others who have 'borrowed' this motif, like Metallica on their great album \\"Reload\\" (on the song \\"Bad seed\\", I think). Percussive keyboard note utilised.      The rest:      Bodies - gothic, grungy intro...you could imagine this being the intro to a Pixies song. A passionate anti-abortion song, it seems to me. This is the other song where Rotten claims the high moral ground and yet again turns nasty against his subject. Lots of 'F' bombs dropped, so to speak. Has that classic, punk rhythm guitar sound to it.    No feelings - Rotten puts on his snotty-nosed, bovver boy persona...vacuous, violent and narcissistic. Guitar is grungy and grating.    Liar - interesting chugga-chugga riff to start with before the mood of the song changes.    Problems - a hard rock song with a blues rock rhythm (like AC/DC do).  Has a 1950s style lead guitar.  Features the lyric \\"You don't do what you want and you fade away\\". Rotten also violates the word \\"problem\\" so that you get the feeling that it isn't an actual word in the English language.    Seventeen - Rotten once again assumes a persona...presumably that of the aged person referenced in the song title.  He has a caricature punk accent, or perhaps that of the said 17 year old snot nosed punk.  The tone might be described as 'mocking', as far as the song's subject goes.  Cook's drumming is interesting times here.  Whereas a band like The Ramones had descriptive lyrics, The Sex Pistols  seemed to inhabit their characters more...the lyrics here are confrontational  and revel in that fact. Sample lyric \\"I'm a lazy sod\\".     Pretty vacant - another song where Rotten invokes a mocking tone on the subjects of his gaze.  Has an iconic lead guitar note picking introduction.  Australian band The Boys Next Door (Nick Cave's old band) referenced this intro, I think, on the opening song of their debut album \\"Door door\\"...that song being \\"The night watchmen\\". The Boys Next Door are described as a 'post-punk' band.  Has a catchy, laddish chorus which is very sing-a-long-able to.  Cook's drumming is interesting here...sort of sounds like he is using bongos or something.  On this song, or perhaps on other versions, Rotten revels on the second syllable of \\"vacant\\", making it sound like a one syllable word I reallycouldn't get away with typing in on this site!    E.M.I. - whereas The Saints started out, literally, as a do it yourself operation, The Sex Pistols held out to get signed for a lot of money from a big recording company.  How did that work out for them?  Listen to this song. They signed up with the company the song takes its title from.  This track is more than just an attack on E.M.I. You do get some insight into what transpired for the brief time that they were contracted to eachother.  As for the song, well, it has a bit of a foot-stomping riff to it, and the guitar solo is, once again, 1950s in style.  Once again, the guitars have a sort of Led Zeppelin, heavy and metallic quality to them.  There is also a little, cute keyboard melody in this song. The outro has Rotten blowing a raspberry. Maybe AC/DC's Bon Scott was inspired to end their album \\"Highway to Hell\\" in a similar vein to this album closer for The Sex Pistols? The lyrics to \\"E.M.I\\" features the phrase \\"The crusher\\", I think. There is a song by that name which is about a wrestler, called \\"The Crusher\\"...probably not about him...not sure...maybe I misheard Rotten.         In conclusion: I think that whilst this album has two of the greatest songs of all time (let along punk songs), there are other punk debut albums which stack up better, as an album experience.  No debut punk album I've heard (or proto-punk album) has any songs remotely as good as the best on this album.   All of the punk albums I've heard up until now have preceded the release of this Pistols album.  Of the punk debut albums I've heard, I think that The Saints \\"(I'm) Stranded\\" is by far the most seminal.        Recommendations:        The great rock'n'roll swindle -  contains other good songs by the band and a nice little fairy story from the band's manager, Malcolm McLaren, to open the album.  Quirky.    The Saints - (I'm) Stranded. Seminal punk album which seems to me to anticipate later movements in music, like speed and thrash, attimes.     Radio Birdman - Radios appear. Another Australian band, contemporaneous with The Saints. Some songs have an \\"Oi\\" punk vibe to them, and they also have some nice, jazzy sounding non-punk songs on that album too.     The Damned - Damned, damned, damned. The first British punk album. Pub rock flavoured punk music.    Ramones - Ramones. The first officially recognised punk album. Pity the guitars are so low in the mix.  On occasion, they display a lovely pop sensibility, which no doubt Rotten would not have abided...perhaps. The Sex Pistols members did hang out with the Ramones when they toured the UK. Joey Ramone takes credit for ALL punk which followed in their wake in the alternative history of  heavy metal edition of  Classic Rock magazine which came out this year. That is a very big stretch...might be slightly true for UK punk, but The Saints weren't a part of that scene and their debut album would have been as it, even if the Ramones had never come to be.    Johnny Thunders and The Heartbreakers - L.A.M.F.  Another band, like Radio Birdman, which get labelled as \\"proto-punk\\" even though I think they have the punk sound to them to justify being called 'punk'.
0316017922|5.0|I think the goal of this book is to provide readers, especially disadvantaged readers, with new ways of thinking about their own behavior, the world around them, and how they relate to that world. I think that Gladwell's goal is to inspire paradigmatic changes in the way disadvantaged people approach their lives and think about their futures.    For the educationally privileged and those people who are mired to the teeth in statistical jargon and stuff like \\"psychometrics\\", \\"Outliers\\" will probably irritate them because it doesn't back anything up with huge amounts of reified \\"data\\" and it makes metaphorical use of the concept of \\"outliers\\" rather than using the term in its most jargon-approved sense. Instead what it does is tell stories. And it connects those stories to observations. In short, it presents a series of case studies in such a way as to let the reader come to some striking conclusions about his or her own standing in the world and what can be done to improve upon it.    Statistics is only science in the fields of science. In sociology, psychology, linguistics, cultural studies, etc, it's a physics-envy pretense, making it every bit as useful as astrology or numerology. So, this book, which completely avoids all the numerological reifications commonly made up using meaningless statistical jargon, actually has something to offer. It presents a case, and does so intelligently in a way that respects the reader's intelligence and powers of comprehension.    This book will mean the most to those who have something to gain in changing the way they think about the world. I think it is for the benefit of these people that Gladwell writes.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Bleedin' shame director James Cameron was such a ninny at the Oscars.  And that Kate Winslet was such a temperamental diva.  And that Leonardo is such a heartthrob.  And that this movie was so expensive to make.<br /><br />Because focusing on any of those irrelevant things will prevent you from enjoying one of the most immersing movies ever made.  Danged if after watching it, you don't feel like you were actually on the Titanic yourself!
B000001FMX|4.0|This is a review of the regular cd, not the product description given here. New York Dolls is one of those bands I've heard OF here in Australia but never actually heard. You never hear them played on commercial FM radio over here.  They do have some songs which might make good candidates for radio over here, I think, which I'll go into in a moment.  Found the sound quality on the cd to be excellent. As for the music, I'd describe it as good time rock'n'roll, of the boisterous sort. Maybe you could describe the band as an alternative Sha Na Na too. They have some boogie rock songs on this cd and they have a punk guitar sound at times without the kind of rhythms you associate with that genre. There is a good booklet which comes with the cd and it has an amusing photo on the flipside...a couple of the band members look like they are smuggling guinea pigs in their trousers!  Anyway, on first listen to this album, I was inclined to give it around 70+ out of 100, but on second listen I've bumped that up to 77 1/2 out of 100. Nowadays bands tend to pack the start of their cds with their best tracks. For me, on second listen, I started liking the songs on the B side more second time around. Actually, the last track of what was the vinyl release's A side, up to the second last song of the old B side impressed me more second time around.  My thoughts on the songs:      The best tracks:      Private world - has a heavy bass intro;  elements of the song are familiar to me (e.g. the rhythm), but I can't place them exactly...perhaps \\"Louie Louie\\" is an inspiration for this song. A catchy song, more so second time around; has hand clapping parts too. The guitar solo at the start and the end also seem familiar.  Some of the guitar is of the heavy rock kind, at times. There is a funky piano bit in this song which just gets catchier on subsequent listens.    Frankenstein  - at 6 minutes in length, this track sustains interest with its catchy groove. Although I'm not really familiar with The Cramps, perhaps you could liken this song to something by them, or perhaps The B-52s. Has screeching vocals but the vocal melody is catchy.      Next best track:       Trash -  this song strikes me as a proto-Ramones song...it has the same kind of influences, but the bands produce something different even though they share a taste in certain kinds of music.  Also, this song makes me think that The Strokes'  great song \\"Last nite\\" may have been influenced by this track.  Sound wise, it has a jive, jitterbug type vibe to it, and I like the backing vocals. In fact, the lead vocals are just as catchy as the backing vocals.  The lead guitar is nice in this song, and a solo features. Bassy track too.      On second listen, songs I liked more:      Bad girl -  a rock'n'roll track with a boogie rhythm to it.  Has a catchy 1950s style vocal rhythm to it...think \\"Get a job\\" without that line from the song. The guitar sound is heavy, hard rock. Lead guitar parts too.    Subway train - a 1950s style ballad with a touch of Mick Jagger-ish vocals and a nod to The Doors' \\"L.A.woman\\".  I like the part of this song which reminds me of \\"Last kiss\\", which I first heard, probably, in a Pearl Jam compilation where this cover song is included.  A mid-tempo rock song with some grating guitar to boot. Bassy, with backing vocals at the end.      Not bad:      Pills - features the harmonica. Catchy vocals and the chorus is simple, but also catchy.  Dual rhythm guitar and backing vocals. There is a good 1950s style lead guitar solo.      The rest:      Jet boy - has some heavy metal-ish guitar, hand claps and nice backing vocals, which is sometimes quite laddish in style.    Personality crisis - rock'n'roll song with some honky tonk piano.  R'n'r style lead guitar solos and some screechy vocals at times too.    Looking for a kiss - boogie rock. Sometimes the rhythm guitar and drums remind me of T-Rex's classic song \\"Get it on\\". Song has drug references.    Vietnamese baby - boogie rock which is grating to a certain extent, but mildly so. Has a whiny lead guitar. The drums get an interesting swooshy effect at one point in the song...a studio created effect.     Lonely planet boy - pleasant, dual accoustic guitars, vaguely reminiscent of The Byrds (I think) and a certain Barry McGuire song.  There is a nice bit in the song which is made by the saxophone, I think, or some such instrument.  In a way this song is a bit like splicing The Velvet Underground with The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, in mild mode...i.e. the vocals are quite smooth here.      Recommendations:      AC/DC: Let there be rock.  Perhaps the ultimate example of Australian pub rock.  Like the New York Dolls, they do rock'n'roll and boogie rock.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|A previous review called this the \\"Beach Boys of Winter\\" which I thought was pretty cool, so that's the title of my short review.    Anyway, I got introduced to this by hearing \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" at a Starbucks while reading the paper.  I've been introduced to a few good bands like this (anything that sticks out I write some lyrics down and go find the band album later).      Since then I got the whole album and have heard it several times.  All the songs are great (although the opening of \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" can get on my nerves until the song gets into full swing).      The sound bites on Amazon (\\"listen\\" links) will give you an idea if you like this album or not.  I still like \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" the best, that song I wish it would go on forever.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I like all the artist in this band. They make very good music together. Very good album.
B000002L9W|5.0|Dave leaves Van Halen and starts solo career strong, too bad he wouldn't be able to keep this line-up together.Eat Em and Smile is sadly DLR's pinnacle in his solo career.   DLR's great lyrics accompained by fantastic guitar and bass by Steve Vai and the bass of Billy Sheehan.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|I have this album on vinyl. Amazon made affordable to buy it on CD, It's the very best from Elvis.
B000002GJ7|5.0|plenty of people bought this for the single\\"more than words\\" and were in for a shock. with more rock and funk than one album should be able to hold. extreme's best by a long shot
B002HNA95E|4.0|It is a daunting task to summarize 25 years worth of great music with just 2 CDs, especially with 87 singles released. Every fan of Madonna has personal favorites, and that makes this \\"Celebration\\" all the more difficult.    With that said, I think this collection does justice! For me personally, they should've tried to touch on every period of her career with Warner Bros., including \\"Something To Remember\\" from the Dick Tracy soundtrack, \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" from A League Of Their Own. And lets not forget \\"Don't Cry For Me, Argentina\\" from Evita(her triumph as an actress).    But overall, \\"Celebration\\" pleases and is a great mix of Madonna over the years! 4 1/2 Stars!
B000002GB9|5.0|This is the grand illusion, come sail away, fooling yourself and miss america. half the album classics.As on those previous albums, Dennis DeYoung's proggy keyboards lead off with the title track, a melodic and attractive piece. Styx, though, are sometimes prone to cliches and obvious philosophies. Couched in this grand production is the message that 'deep inside we're all the same.' It's rather like rolling out the red carpet to introduce a film extra. The album's theme is fame: the aspirations, disillusionment and pitfalls. DeYoung (I suspect they're his lyrics) tends to recycle his material; on separate songs we're told 'come on in,' 'step right this way' and 'climb aboard.' Tommy Shaw's two songs are quite refreshing as a result, especially the rocking 'Man In The Wilderness,' the most intense track on the album. By contrast, 'Superstars' is bland by the band's standards. DeYoung's big triumphs here, though, are the anthemic, six-minute 'Come Sail Away' and the brooding tale, 'Castle Walls.' James Young has  'Miss America.'
B001N18HO6|5.0|This \\"Collector's Edition\\" is such a great way to revisit Pearl Jam's monumental debut \\"Ten\\". Arguably the best album to rise from the \\"Grunge\\" era, let alone one of the most important albums in music, the \\"Ten\\" album deserves this treatment. The Unplugged DVD(finally released) is a great view of an energetic band gripping the music scene with the Seattle sound. The Redux version of \\"Ten\\" is flawless at minimizing the flaws of the original(drowning reverb, later dissaproved by the band themselves) and bringing out the instumental contribution of each band member more clearly. And the memorabilia speaks for itself...WOW!!    If you are a fan of Pearl Jam or music in general, you CANNOT go wrong with this set...5 STARS!
B000JJRIP2|5.0|kiss alive 1, kiss alive 2 , kiss alive 3 and the millennium concert all in one package. the only drawback would be that the best buy version with 2 exclusive songs (millennium concert) is no longer available.I would recommend putting the millennium concert on your hard drive and speeding it up just a little,cause it's slow and plodding,but can be fixed easily..............
0439023491|4.0|This second book in the trilogy kept me turning pages- I devoured it as quickly as I did the first one. But the return to the Hunger Games wasn't nearly as exciting as it was when it was a new idea. I wanted to know much more about the rebellions and much less about how Katniss was going to survive the games, because of course we knew she would. I wanted to  know even less about her romantic decisions, partly because Gale's character is so underdeveloped. As a small point- the flashing of the Mockingjay watch was too obvious a clue- unless you are a young reader, I suppose. Which brings me to another point- why is this considered young adult fiction? I know the protagonist is 17, but it is a violent series with very adult themes. I found this book in the children's section of my local bookstore! I wouldn't give it to anyone younger than Katniss herself. Overall, I enjoyed this book- but mostly as a portal to what I hope will be an amazing final chapter in this creative series of speculative fiction.

1416594787|5.0|Richard Dawkins has provided an elegant refutation of the myth of Intelligent Design. I have purchased and immensely enjoyed the audio version of this book, [[ASIN:1416594787 The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution]]. Dawkins work constitutes a milestone of rationality. The evidence provided should be enough to convince most objective readers of the \\"FACT\\" of evolution. This book should prompt a diligent reader or a serious scholar to compare the products of natural selection against the products of the \\"Grand Designer in the Sky\\". Christians and other fans of the God of Love would have you believe that human beings are the apple of God's eye. How many times have we heard that \\"God Loves Us\\"? Well if that is the case, why can salamanders regenerate limbs but not humans? Are human bodies the best that the Intelligent Designer could architect?  Or do the \\"history deniers\\", to quote this work, prattle that it is God's Will for human beings to suffer the loss of limbs with no hope of regeneration?    I strongly recommend this book to young aspiring intellectuals who are daily challenged to refute the impressive and malicious stupidity of religious dogmatism.
1401323820|5.0|If you enjoy the ABC TV show Castle, you will enjoy the book 'written' by the author Richard Castle.  Within a page you find yourself reading the names Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook and substituting Kate and Castle.  It's a fast read and a wild ride.  Hang on and enjoy it.    I can't wait until they release other Richard Castle `best sellers'.
1416594787|5.0|The Greatest Show on Earth is a fascinating and comprehensive account of the wide array of evidence for evolution. It is still quite astonishing that in the US alone, 40% of the population profess to a denial of evolution as a fact, and Dawkins takes this worrying figure as his impetus, to set out straight why we can be confident in the factual veracity of evolution. As he says in his foreword, his previous books on the subject took for granted the acceptance of evolution, little realising that there would still be in 2009 such a strong need to go back a few steps in order to convince large proportions of the population that evolution really does explain the rich variety we see in nature. In that respect, The Greatest Show acts like a solid foundation for Dawkins' other works (and any book about evolution) and anyone who is still on the fence would probably be best off reading this book before any others.    As ever and as you'd expect from someone who held the post of Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, Dawkins delivers an account that is somewhat easy to understand for the layperson, effortlessly juggling metaphors to facilitate what can sometimes be quite daunting science. For instance, the chapter on embryology where he delves into the workings of proteins and enzymes I feel was greatly helped by his use of the origami analogy, or the metaphor of the police detective at a crime scene piecing together the many clues - which in turn led to the use of the spy camera analogy to explain the crafty  `god of the gaps' argument so loved by creationists.    I'm glad the book began with an explanation of the word `theory' as used by scientists as this seems to be one of the most pervasive and unfortunate misunderstandings surrounding evolution and it's not solely the fault of mischievous creationists - it's not difficult to see why one would conclude that evolution is `only a theory' in the unsubstantiated sense of the word and therefore reserve their judgement on its ultimate veracity. Whether Dawkins' new term `theorum' to replace `theory' will take off remains to be seen but I think he is absolutely right that a new term is needed.    I also found many examples simply fascinating; such as the tadpole in a lab that had a small square cut from its back and grafted onto its underbelly which then grew into a frog that would itch it's back when that patch (now distinct from the rest of its underside) was tickled! (Actually I still can't quite fathom why this happens since that patch of skin I'm assuming still has its own nerve endings and I would have thought the frog would have learnt over time from where the sensation occurs - and does scratching the back alleviate the itch? Anyway, it does occur and I guess that's what matters!)     I also enjoyed reading about some of the examples I already knew about such as the laryngeal nerve and the vestigial leg bones in whales - actually Dawkins mentions in the book the Channel 4 documentary he took part in where they dissected a giraffe and removed the laryngeal nerve but on a previous episode of the same show (Natures Giants I think it was called) they did a dissection of a beached whale and uncovered the vestigial leg bones. Fascinating stuff. I also enjoyed revisiting Dawkins' full uncut interview with Wendy Wright which I think you can find on YouTube - slap the head frustrating for sure!    There is of course a whole lot more science and evidence in the book and feel it amounts to a well rounded and useful reference.    However, I do have a couple of minor issues. Firstly, when outlining the procedure for radioactive dating, I found myself still lacking understanding over one key point which I don't think was explained at all and that was how we can be certain of the fact of the decaying half-lives that are millions or  billions of years. I don't doubt for a moment that this dating method is well verified by scientists but I don't recall Dawkins pointing this out, I think he said something along the lines of \\"...and we know that the half-life of such and such is x billion years...\\". It is a key point and means I'll have to do some additional research for an answer - perhaps I need to re-read that chapter...?    However my main criticism is the way Dawkins often used the imperfections inherent in nature (e.g. immense suffering, arms races between predator and prey, the laryngeal nerve detour, the eye,) as `evidence' against an intelligent designer.  I am not for one minute saying that I believe there is a divine creator because as an atheist myself, I think it's unlikely but I still find this line of reasoning highly flawed if only because it presumes to know the mind / intentions / capabilities of said supposed creator. The argument also leaves itself open to a wide range of easy simplistic answers from creationists (i.e. `even if nature contains flaws anything that can create all this life is still intelligent'; `he works in mysterious ways'; `we can't understand his ultimate plan'; `maybe there are many gods creating life, some better at it than others' and `they use each other's templates'!!!) - the list could go on. I found myself wincing each time Dawkins used this argument only because I feel it is very weak in that it doesn't constitute actual evidence against a god like he seems to think it does.    Despite those two niggles, Dawkins has written another great book, full of fascination and awe. It's no doubt a much needed book and has filled the gap brilliantly - highly recommended for those who want a solid grounding in the wide range of evidence of evolution.
B000VI6T6K|2.0|As other reviewers have pointed out, the audio is poor.  Also, much better versions of these songs are available on later recordings.  In 1967, Hendrix was just getting started in his short career and he later took all of these songs to a much higher level. Buy it as a historical record of Hendrix's earliest days but look elsewhere for quality.

1439102813|5.0|A very solid read. It is a book about a Harvard Professor being diagnosed with Early Onset Alzheimer's Disease and how this disease has changed her life as a mother, wife and a professor. It talks about how her symptoms progress and the emotions she goes through. The book always goes about how the family cope with the diagnosis. It makes you sad and wonder a lot. I did not cry while reading it but it definitely is thought provoking and makes you appreciate things a lot better. I often stopped reading and thought about all the \\"what if\\"s and I was able to be in her shoes and understand the pain and struggle Alice has to experience. Some of the incidents used in this book to demonstrate her disease worsening make my heart ache.    A wonderful read and I would recommend it to everyone!

0385504225|4.0|Wow, Dan Brown sure does know how to attract a tough reviewing crowd!  But, I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed this latest novel of his.  But, then again, I typically do enjoy thrillers, and almost all decent ones do follow a basic format that apparently offends some folks as not being \\"real literature\\".<br /><br />That format includes a really evil bad guy, good guys faced with a deadly crisis with potentially catastrophic results if it's not solved in time, less focus on character development than on the plot and action, and short cliff hanging chapters.  Yes, Robin Cook uses it. Dean Koontz uses it. David Baldacci uses it. Michael Crichton used it. Big thriller movies use it.  And, just as in [[ASIN:1400079179 The Da Vinci Code]], Dan Brown uses it in this one.  When combined with decent story-telling ability, a unique plot and theme, as well as some surprising twists, turns and revelations - it can make for an enjoyable, \\"can't-it-down\\" page-turning fun, roller coaster ride of a read. It doesn't always happen, but it did for me with this one.<br /><br />Brown reheats his own particular brand of this formula from the DaVinci Code, which again places the smart \\"nerdy\\" hero Langdon (versus the oft used macho-ex-SEAL type) chasing an intelligent trail of historical clues to solve the do-or-die mystery.  It's a format I enjoyed then, but was skeptical he could replicate into a uniquely, entertaining story (Particularly, given the number of writers I've read since then, that have tried to do so, and failed.) But, he does it well. And,unlike a lot of even very enjoyable thrillers, I learned a lot along the way about the derivatives of everyday words, D.C. and some of it's monuments.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you didn't like The DaVinci Code or aren't really a fan of thrillers - odds are you're not going to like this one. If in particular, you don't like novels that take on the religious/science debate, or use a spin on historical or biblical references to create a fictional tale - than you're really not going to enjoy it.  On the other hand, if you just enjoy a unique,fast-paced thinking-man hero thriller that keeps you turning the pages (and aren't who I just named) - than I think you'll enjoy this one.ou're really not going to enjoy it.

B001KP2J3U|5.0|Agatha Christie and Peter Ustinov are real geniuses. The élan of Peter Ustinov, his utmost British attitude, as well as David Niven's, make the film a dear one. I enjoyed every second of it. Besides, the plot developed by Agatha Christie is very exciting. The film, with those views of Egypt is a plus more. The performances, Angela Lansbury's for example is delightful. Bette Davis is a grande dame. I do recommend this film. If you want to spend a delicious time, please watch this movie. Follow the dialogues with care, for they are abdsolutely splendid. And the wardrobe.!!. Well, it deserved an Oscar. Go ahead and have a grand evening. Eugenia.

B001M4YZ90|5.0|This was a clever picture.  It had exceptionally strong characters and the actors that played them portrayed them perfectly.  Guy Richie has a knack about getting a stella cast for his pictures and he definitely did it in this one.  There were no horrible performance's in this picture.  There are no dragging scenes, its all constant, fast paced as you follow two different plots in story simultaneously that meet up at the end, which is kind of a who done it.    For some reason when Guy Richie comes out with a new movie I always think its going to stink.  Every time I am amazed at how good it is.  Guy Richie in my eyes is the next Tarantino, I think even better.  He is creating the standard for the \\"New Age Gangster Film\\".  It doesn't have to be violent and bloody to be a great movie and he proves this time and time again.    This in my eyes is a must see.  Even if this is not your so called genre, still see it, you will be surprised as well as pleased.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|When I first saw the commercials about how Snow White was going to be on Blu-Ray, I wondered if it was worth it.  Would a movie made about 80 years ago really translate to Blu-Ray?  Would I notice a difference from other versions? I was surprised to say yes!  The picture was much better.  It is all-new digital restored with enhanced picture and sound, so with the Blu-Ray, the picture is amazing.    The add-ons are terrific.  Snow White Returns - Newly discovered storyborads.  Was Walt planning a sequel? was so interesting.  My family liked finding out which princess they are most like.  Plus the kids enjoyed the \\"Heigh-Ho Karaoke\\" sing-along.      Having a DVD + Blu-ray is great for kids.  I allow my kids to play the DVD by themselves, not worrying if they scratch it, but I keep the Blu-Ray for our family to watch together.
0385504225|1.0|What a disappointment.  After reading all of Dan Brown's other books I was expecting another edge of the seat nail biter with well thought out characters and a fast moving plot line.  Instead I felt like I attended a very long and rather boring lecture with a few moments of action inserted as intermissions.  Nothing about this book moved fast and  several times I came close to not even finishing it.  But I had HOPE and thought  the book might get better as it drew to a conclusion.  It didn't; in fact the last  forty or so pages could have been left out of the book without being missed.    Don't waste your money or your time on this book.

0810993139|5.0|If you want to be brought back to your childhood, or understand why your children are acting the way they are, then I suggest this book to you.  I found myself laughing so hard at this book because I remembered my middle school days and my friends back then and the crazy things we did and believed in.  Almost everyone growing up had their own version of the \\"cheese touch\\" and can relate to that in a personal way.  I could not contain my laughter as I read this book and I felt that Jeff Kinney completely related to a seventh grade boy.  His humor and honesty really come across as a genuine young man.<br /> This book, though it seems juvenile, expresses completely the thoughts and feelings of a young adult that age.  What seems silly to us is really important to the youth.  Young adults want to be popular, and usually don't mind letting others take the blame for them.  Everyone at that age pretty much only cares for themselves and wants to do all they can to make others like them.  Even something as silly as touching an old piece of cheese can be social suicide for a young adult.<br /> This book deals with honest emotions of a young man, friendships and social aspects of middle school, and bullies.  With humor and honesty Jeff Kinney relates a story of a young man who is open about his life and is not ashamed about his feelings.  I loved this book and would recommend it to people of all ages.
B001GKJ2F2|2.0|I like action movies and I can accept action movies that are silly, but this film is a slow starter and has some horrible dialogue! I'm sure it plays better to those who know the comic book this was based on, but for those of us who don't have a clue about the comic; this film will bore you at times. The good news is the second half is better than the first and it does have the beautiful Angelina Jolie in it.<br /><br />Some will like this film more than others as you can see by the wide range of reviews on this site. It's not completely horrible, but I won't be watching this a second time any time soon.

0385504225|1.0|After properly heaping abuse on Christianity in \\"Angels and Demons\\" and \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" Dan Brown appears to offer an abject apology to Christians in his new and very boring \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" The symbol that is lost is the Bible itself, the \\"word,\\" with an eerie quasi-scientific \\"noetics\\" new age bent.  It's a long, long way to a very little house - this story.<br /><br />Filled with inaccurate facts, populated with boring to mind-numbing characters, and a plot that goes nowhere very, very slowly, Brown has created an unreadable and pitifully inadequate commercial product with his newest (and failed) endeavor, \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"<br /><br />The so-called story line is borderline ridiculous.  As Bertrand Russell once wrote, \\"It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching for evidence which could support this.\\"  Unfortunately for the reader, Russell's observation is oh-so-true here. All of the characters from the evil Mal'akh, to Peter Solomon, to Katherine Solomon, to Robert Langdon and to CIA director Sato and other minor players are jokes, stick figures, irrational, uninteresting and totally unlikable. Too many of the pages are filled with bizarre, violent, grisly and inhumane descriptions of people at their worst, while they abuse and terrorize others in the extreme. Not one of the torture or abuse scenes was readable.<br /><br />Brown uses the literary technique of dialogue to teach the reader arcane (and inaccurate) stuff, all of which is immensely boring and obtuse: architecture; Masonic history; and Washington, D.C. geography and architectural history. As a result, almost all the dialogue is unrealistic and mind-numbing. You will, as I did, scan and skip over most of it, in order to keep yourself from throwing the book to the floor in frustration and disgust, while trying to retain the thread of the story.  There is way too much comic book style \\"eek!\\" \\"egad!\\" \\"gosh!\\" \\"holy cow!\\" stuff. Whenever you see that many exclamation points in a supposed literary text, you know the author is in trouble. And, the silent thoughts (in italics no less) of the characters are all - repeat all -- stupid or worse.<br /><br />This is not the worst book I have read in the past 5 years, but it's a close runner up to other publications I have endured to the end, but those were admittedly known to be trash to begin with.<br /><br />This new age nonsense rates only a 1.

0385504225|2.0|I read all other books from Dan Brown; so, I was excited to buy this one as soon as it was available. I was very disappointed after about 100 pages into it. It seems Dan Brown is running out of new ideas. It would be an okay book to read if you never read other Dan Brown books or any book relates to symbolism. He's getting so predictable in his plots.

B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a true story told by the survivors of easy company of the 101st airborne during World War 2. It begins in boot camp, and it spans all the way to the end of war, when the men hear about Japan's surrender.<br />This blu-ray version has great picture, it almost has the same quality as planet earth but what this blu-ray version of the series shines in, is the sound. Mind you, I never owned the dvd version but I have never heard such sound quality from any other dvd/blu-ray I own. The explosions sound very real as does the bullet whizzing too. Also, in the 1-2 parts when the troopers are in the c47 planes, it sounds just like you're in the airplane together with them.<br />Overall this series has it all for the action/war film fanatic. Even though it has great picture/sound quality, I wouldn't recommend if you own the dvd version already. However, if you saw it on tv, or you've never seen it but you like action films or war movies, then this is definitely a must have. The price is also a steal since I bet you won't find another blu-ray set (of such quality) of 6 discs for [...].

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a game somewhat akin to Risk, but better because it employs more elements and is not necessarily combative in nature. Players need to use math skills (ratios & probability), communication skills (trading) and long term planning to win. All that being said, the complexity of any particular game is determined primarily by the players. In short, my 10 year old sister can play it & enjoy it as much as I do, as can my parents. Also, because each game is a little different, Settlers never gets boring. I love it! I can't reccomend it highly enough!

0385504225|5.0|I'm surprised at all of the critical reviews of this book.  I guess I shouldn't be too surprised - people always set insurmountable expectations for events like this one.  They are bound to be disappointed.  I, for one, consider any book that I can't put down to be a successful venture in this age of 24/7 stimuli.  I not only enjoyed this book, I would (dare I say!) read it again one of these days.<br /><br />Brown weaves a convincing story that, just as in DaVinci, urges readers take a second look at the world around them.  The book is well researched and chock full of puzzles, rituals, symbols and science.  This unique combination is Brown's hallmark, and no other author I've read has been able to come close to perfecting the formula.<br /><br />Lost Symbol isn't going to win any literary competitions.  It was not written to move the English language to a new frontier, folks.  It was written to entertain, and for me at least, it did exactly that.

When I heard Erin, the owner, was coming out with a cookbook full of her secrets I wanted to cry tears of happiness! I could finally make these amazing treats in the comfort of my own home!!! I have to admit, the ingredients can get a little expensive if you bake often, but for a few times a month it is completely reasonable and worthwhile. I've found everything at Whole Foods Market (minus the dry rice milk powder, which I found here on Amazon.com to, to make the frosting.) I also had to play around with the frosting recipe and I substituted the soy milk for a combo of rice milk powder, rice milk and coconut milk. I also had to modify some of the baking times to make sure my items were cooked thoroughly (325 F doesn't seem to be enough for everything, depending on the item). I made the spelt apple pie the other night, and it was DELICIOUS, but it needed more time in the oven because the crust on the bottom was still kind of raw. SO - be patient and play around with your oven and the results will be scrumptious! I've even converted my husband, who is italian with a major sweet-tooth, and he is now eating gluten/sugar/dairy free without knowing the difference. THANK YOU ERIN.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|They say Fringe is like The X-Files and that's true to a point. Both feature heroes working for the FBI involved in trying to uncover paranormal conspiracies while dealing with the strange and odd. But how the writers choose to tell the story diverges wildly.    The X-Files is cerebral suspense, its heroes delving into shadowy corners of the world where proof of what they believe is elusive. Only the agent's own faith in the rightness of their cause sustains them against the mocking regard of peers and the obstruction of the unknown powerful conspiracy hiding from the world. Monsters are only half-seen, evidence turns up false or misleading, allies may not be as trustworthy as they seem.     Fringe, on the other hand, is cheerfully upfront about its improbable mysteries. Its more action-thriller where the point is to confront and defeat the episode's current bad guy and the world around them accepts what they do without batting an eye. Much more black and white than the X-Files ever was. Monsters are clearly shown and shock value of carnage and bloodshed gets plenty of screentime. There is a conspiracy and the writers are taking their time revealing it but its not the dark menace of X-File's alien conspiracy.     None of this is to say that Fringe is bad in anyway...just different. The starring roles are all solidly cast and the plots interesting and varied. The meta-plot mythology is developing nicely with a few surprising twists. Fringe isn't afaid to do a bit of comedy too and most will find the elder Dr. Bishop to be quite funny. The second season opens with a bang and carries its ongoing storylines gracefully.     The DVD set itself is well done with lots of extras and deleted scenes.     I give Fringe 4 out of 5 stars as a matter of personal preference rather than any negatives with the show. Watch it!

Aayan is an amazing woman and her story is almost unbelievable, especially for myself as one who has never had to face the trials she did as a woman.

Truly an inspiring book and I am so glad I have it in my reading library!
0385504225|2.0|The best thing Dan Brown has done for the world of literature is to spawn a legion of authors following in his footsteps of intelligent, historical/end-of-the world fiction tales.  Unfortunately, for Brown, several of these authors (Steve Berry, James Rollins, Lynn Sholes & Joe Moore, Brad Thor, etc.) have FAR surpassed him in creating engaging, page-turning fiction within this genre.    Brown's first three novels were brilliant - \\"Digital Fortress\\", \\"Deception Point\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\" - he was on pace to becoming the new Michael Crichton (the ability to write intelligent fiction that required constant use of an Encyclopedia to truly enjoy the reading experience).  Regretably, his last novel - \\"The DaVinci Code\\" was so dumbed-down for mass consumption that you had to second-guess the identity of the author.  The novel ONLY received hype and ridiculous sales success due to the controversial subject matter.  Let's face it, the Christian world does not stand for anyone threatening their story of Jesus.    Global best-selling powerhouses like King and Rushdie dismissed Brown's \\"DaVinci Code\\" as being both trite and trash.  I thought that was a bit harsh and, like millions of other readers, looked forward to his next work.  Is \\"The Lost Symbol\\" worth the wait?  In a simple word - NO!  Robert Langdon is at it again - this time, racing through the catacombs of the Capitol Building and other Washington D.C. landmarks in an effort to figure out the symbolic secrets hidden within the Masonic Temple.  When Landgon's best friend, Peter Solomon, is captured and has his hand cut off by a full-body tatooed lunatic known only as Mal'akh, he is on a race against time to decipher the symbolic code for the 'baddie' in order to save his friend's life.      What follows, for over 500+ pages, is mind-numbingly boring and not at all exciting.  In fact, Brown is reduced to the James Patterson idiotic technique of ultra-short chapters (some no more than a paragraph long) with each one ending in a pseudo-cliffhanger.  I had to keep checking the jacket photo to ensure that this was, indeed, a Dan Brown novel and not written by Team Patterson.  The mysteries of the Masons are, quite frankly, not very interesting and ground that has been covered by Nicolas Cage in the horrible \\"National Treasure\\" films.  You would have more excitement reading the back of a U.S. Dollar Bill!  The only highlight in the book is when the actual identity of Mal'akh is revealed (however outlandish and unrealistic it is).  The book ends with so much religious & new age mumbo-jumbo I felt preached to rather than walking away enlightened.    The only thing lost with \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is the $30 I paid for the book and the nights of tiresome reading I subjected myself to in finishing this dreck!

0385504225|3.0|I do not know wheather to cry or yell out loud! I can not even laugh--way not funny either.  I waited so long for this book and now I am wondering where Dan Brown went?   It simply does not stand up to his first two in this series.  His character, Robert Langdon, has become a closed minded, know-it-all, professor. I tried to count how many times Langdon said he did not beleive there was a hidden \\"word\\" and after 6 times I gave up.  There are 133 chapters,100 would have been enough(already).   So many of them repeat and repeat what was said in previous chapters. I am so flusterated I want to shake some one, maybe the book editor--- someone ought to pay for this mess! Dan, you need a hug!
1400082773|4.0|It tells you how Obama grew up and how he thought about things from dealing with people and politics in his young life. How family, friends and society influenced or shaped his upbringing. Personally I feel as being President that he really doesn't benefit blacks that much because he didn't live as we did in a black home. He was sheltered from much of what blacks in the 50-60's went through. Otherwise he would have seen through the Affirmative Action Case with the Firefighters. Instead of saying \\"we\\" need more education he should have said let's get investigators to check out this test that no black firefighters can pass. As a Registered Nurse I've seen many professionals pass or fail the Nursing Test. But I know that there is a way that questions could be geared toward certain racial backgrounds in order to confuse certain test takers. Also I think his priorites are mixed up when he is trying to change health reform and lengthen school days when unemployment is through the roof and thousands of kids are living in homeless shelters. Would I vote for him again as a black minority? Probably NOT.

1416550542|3.0|Kudos for: \\"Fairytale\\" clues to the mystery; romantic place and time period; \\"cozy\\" English garden feel.  It is NOT a cookie-cutter novel.  Nice emphasis on mother-daughter multi-generational female relationships.      Problems I had with it:  Tedious to read and borrowed some ideas (I thought) from Diane Setterfield's \\"The Thirteenth Tale.\\"    Too many characters, too many generations.  The \\"outer stories\\" (the grandmother and granddaughter trying to unravel the mystery of the past) don't have any stakes other than that they want to uncover their roots.  There is no \\"dramatic action\\" or risk for these sleuth characters.  There was a lot of dialogue with minor characters slowly imparting \\"clues\\", and these conversations were often interrupted by silly things like, \\"oh, I have a luncheon to go to\\".  It really dragged.  The dialogue just didn't stand up in place of dramatic action.  The author could have used some of the pages of this novel to dramatize (via flashbacks) some of conflicts she very quickly summarized pertaining to the sleuth characters' past histories.  Because there were so many characters, I didn't think any of them were very deep or richly portrayed.  This book reminded me of Diane Setterfield's \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" which came out two years earlier (character names, hair color, English manor setting, hints of incestuous ardor, main character as a writer with a mystery in her past).

I watched this movie every time it came on HBO when I was a kid and I've loved this movie ever since. I put it up there with The Princess Bride which is another I have seen 100 times probably! All the actors in Legend are great, especially Tim Curry who plays Darkness, Tom cruise, Mia Sara, she is so talented and beautiful. I highly recommend Legend, it has all the extras you could want and the 2nd dvd is a darker directors cut.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|So many people have talked about the two principles, and not only the actors' great performances, but the choices the two main characers make, that no more needs to be said about that.  For me, a huge portion of the poignance of this film is the fact that their story is framed by the story of her two children, and how they grow from learning about their mother.  The scene at the end where they're at the bridge with her ashes is sure to make you cry, if you haven't already.  Her honesty with them after her death is her final gift to them, as was her decision to stay, and their willingness at the end to honor her wish is their final gift to her.  It's quite beautiful, and redeems her sacrifice.  It's what they should mean when they call something an \\"adult\\" film.  This is truly an adult film.

0143038419|5.0|I have read some of the negative reviews here and I realize that perhaps these people were not on the same path as Elizabeth. This is not a judgement, just that if you are not or have been where Elizabeth was then you may not understand the book the way I do and so many other women have. Every woman that I gave this book to told me later that they saw pieces of themselves in here. Look, you may find yourself without having to leave the place you live now.       I think the book was brilliant and that every woman if she is honest with herself has at one time or another felt like the world was going to hell in a hand basket and had to re-evaluate what she was going to do. I myself could totally understand how a woman could be in the bathroom sobbing her heart out for the direction her life had taken and not really sure she like it that way.     I think that Elizabeth writes from the heart of all women and with an honesty that can be frightening to others, to look at their lives in the same way. She spoke to my heart so many times through out this book and I felt a kinship with her.      The book is basically about a woman on a journey of self discovery. she is looking for the parts of herself that she left behind somewhere and the new places she wants to make. I would recomend it to all women that have wondered what was happening to them in their lives.

B00275EHCI|4.0|In World of Warcraft, that bloodthirsty mass of muscle could well be a geeky, bully-bashed highschooler. In Second Life, that cute, bouncy blonde might the chosen face of a fat, forty-something bald guy. People wear masks of various kinds through most of their daily lives, for perfectly good reasons as well as not-so-good ones. Suppose the mask took over, leaving every trace of the actual person behind?<br /><br />That's where this movie starts, in a world populated almost entirely by who people wish they were instead of who they are. Even within Willis's marriage, he sees only the plastic-perfect version of his wife that he wants seen, not the actual, flesh and blood woman he married.<br /><br />Willis, as he so often does, plays the role of a police investigator. This time, the investigation starts when someone's plastic public presence is destroyed - no big deal, since killing a remote-controlled robot is only vandalism. Soon, however, it turns out that something terrible has happened, something impossible. The whole world of synthetic presences is under attack without even knowing it. The rest turns into chases, guns, and last minute saves. You know, the usual.<br /><br />But, as usual, Willis does a pretty good job with the role he's given. This could have been a much more thoguhtful movie, going deeper into the world of hidden people, but it's not that movie. It's good science fiction adventure, with a backdrop of Boston's \\"Brutalist\\" architecture that fits the bleak mood perfectly.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
159102594X|5.0|I randomly found this trilogy looking for some fiction to read that dealt with a barbarian protagonist. This trilogy has been utterly amazing. I'm wrapping up the 3rd book and will definitely buy the independent 4th book and the 5th book coming from Joe in 2011 or so. Not only are the books well written with an amazing story, but the combat sequences will grab you by the throat and make you pay attention. Abercrombie is also a pretty cool guy, I emailed him to tell I liked his work and ask him some questions and he emailed me back. If you like fantasy, you will like this trilogy.

B0025KVLUQ|3.0|Thinking that I would have an enhanced listening experience, I purchased this remastered version of the Beatles' Abby Road.  Despite all the hype, some of it definitely over the top, the sound isn't especailly better.  I have listened closely to this new version with the '87 release and the difference is minimal.  Moreover, as George Martin was not apparently involved with the new version, we no longer have any reference to how the Beatles actually conceived it to sound (instead we are left with the judgment of some engineer, who probably was a child when Abbey Road was relased).  Not a waste of time exactly, but definitely not that big of a deal.  Based upon this I shan't expend more money on the remasters; they simply aren't worth the cost.  Frankly, it all appears to be a scheme to sell to us the albums and cds we already have.

B0013D8LOK|2.0|Hard to say whether this would have seemed better had I not seen it in such close proximity to the touring production of John Doyle's drop-dead-amazing, even-better-than-the-Angela Lansbury-version revival. Sweeney Todd is a Sondheim show, near operatic. Sondheim shows require hard-core singers. Johnny Depp is not a bad singer. He'd be an acceptable front man for any number of today's alt-rock bands. Helena Bonham-Carter tries gamely. Sadly, they lack the technique and gravitas to put the material over as it should be done, and as you know it can be done if you are lucky enough to have seen Judy Kaye on stage as Mrs. Lovett. And how can you have Sweeney Todd without \\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\\"? I understand they did not want \\"show stopper\\" songs that work on stage to slow the narrative drive of a film, but they could have at least played it over the credits. A disappointment given the talent involved and the quality of the source material.     I did use Helena Bonham-Carter's look as the inspiration for my Halloween costume last year.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Please note that this is on the movie and not the digitized DVD versions.<br /><br />I woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't sleep last night, turned on the TV, and happened to catch this since it's only about an hour and a half long. Amazingly I had never seen the original Frankenstein before.<br /><br />This might be the most iconic horror film of all time, done in a time before the Hollywood censorship code of 1935, and having inspired literally hundreds of knock-offs over the decades. Far from being the early raw, naive horrorfest that others have seen in it here, in fact the movie shows great finesse, sophistication, and creativity at almost every turn.<br /><br />The actors all turn in outstandingly nuanced performances (of course Karloff's would become the sine qua non of such roles for decades), the mood inspiring cinematography and backdrops are appropriately and overwhelmingly dark and creepy, the sets (especially the lab in the tower) are spectacular, the electrical machinery and special effects during the storm are impressive even by modern standards, and the suspense and the action gripping and spine tingling.<br /><br />This is truly a classy blast from the past that has lost nothing to all the later reprisals with their bigger budgets and more sophisticated and advanced special effects. Frankenstein remains a pioneering classic that still stands head and shoulders above the competition.
6305692572|4.0|A thoughtful, insightful movie. Don't coming looking for a romantic comedy or you will be disappointed. I was curious about it because Al Franken had co-written the screenplay. I was familiar with his career as a Saturday Night Live performer and writer and his political satire. As the child of a non-recovered alcoholic parent, I was interested, especially after he launched his Senate campaign, to see how he would handle a difficult, serious, topic of an intimate, personal nature. Al and the rest of the filmmakers did a fine job with a subject that is usually handled in a trite, happy-ever-after ending way.     The movie asks the interesting question: what's harder, the alcoholism or the recovery?     Meg Ryan's character, Alice, drank a lot even before she and her husband, played by Andy Garcia, got married. Alice is a charming, fun drunk. Andy, a caretaker personality, seems to enjoy peeling her off whatever surface she's landed on and carrying her to bed--at least when he's home, which is not all the time since he's an airline pilot. Unfortunately, Alice progresses from being the life of the party to drinking vodka for breakfast. She's not so much fun any more, in fact, she's a wreck, and you won't like her. Her drinking threatens the physical safety and emotional health of her children as drives them around and strikes out at them irrationally when she's drunk. Alice finally is so scared at the danger she's put her children into that she realizes she's out of control and goes into rehab.     The drinking part of the movie is more heart-wrenching than usual because the danger to the children is more graphic than is usually shown. However, the rehab portion of the movie is where it really departs from cliche and challenges the audience. While Alice goes through the process, she cannot see her family, nor does she particularly want to. When she comes home, she's a transformed person. She's got an edge to her, a fierceness, she did not have before, and she has to cling to that difference to avoid falling back into her old patterns. Her husband, who has been comfortable in the caretaker role, does not know what to do. He wants to take care of her and help her as he has always done, but she now must take care of herself. Their old marital paradigm is dead, and whether they can find a new paradigm is not at all clear. You might see a happy ending; I saw an ending where things might get better, but there are no guarantees.     My husband did not find Meg Ryan's performance persuasive. I thought she did quite a good job outside her usual bubbly-cute persona, though she never looks as bad as someone who drinks as much as her character drinks would be expected to look. At least she's not afraid to create a character the audience won't like. Andy Garcia and the supporting actors are excellent. The real star, though, is the thought-provoking, challenging script.
B001UE27X8|5.0|These new releases are truly a window on the process of creation. Though there are similar elements in each take, there are significant differences in the alternate versions. Under most circumstances, it is quite obvious to the disernable listener why the release take was chosen--a flubbed note here, a slightly late entrance there--but some of the alternate takes are equal to the release takes, so it comes down to the aesthetics of the performers as to which performances they favored. It has been decades since these recordings came out, but who's counting? The music is as valid today as when the recordings were first marketed. This music expresses the artistic concepts of two artists at the top of their game. The recordings are a must for listeners who enjoy the intimate nature of chamber music--simply voice and piano. There are transcendent moments a-plenty on these discs... and the price is more than reasonable. No matter how you obtain these Bill Evans-Tony Bennett albums--retail store or (preferrably) Amazon--don't hesitate! Musical epiphanies await.

Captured by government troops when he is thirteen, this gentle boy is traumatized, hooked on drugs and trained to kill.

B000UJCALI|3.0|If you're new to \\"The Shining\\" and intend to read the book and see the film, for goodness sake don't read the book first. Stephen King's novel [[ASIN:0340951397 The Shining]] is a very different enterprise, the experience of which will colour your expectations for Stanley Kubrick's film.<br /><br />The novel uses traditional narrative tools of written fiction - as you'd expect: we are led into a complex story through richly drawn characters whose dilemma is examined through metaphor and figurative structure. King's outstanding achievement was to deliver such intellectual richness in the context of such a barnstorming yarn. Other than [[ASIN:0099532921 Thomas Harris]], I can't think of another writer who comes close (though if anyone has other suggestions please let me know!).<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick - he of, most comparably, [[ASIN:B000JJS982 2001: A Space Odyssey]] (notably also ostensibly a dramatisation of a [[ASIN:1857236645 popular novel]] from a \\"pulp fiction\\" genre) - was an artiste of a completely different medium: a cineaste: by no means simply (or at all) a dramatiser of written literature.  And, like 2001, this film is not an adaptation of its source material, but a jumping-off point; the equivalent of a musical variation on a theme extracted from - based upon - King's novel. An essence is retained, but much of the narrative superstructure of the novel simply isn't here. The setting becomes simply the context for an entirely different  sort of statement, built out of different material: images and sounds, rather than words.<br /><br />Thus, while we see scenes from the novel extracted almost verbatim, they are often delivered entirely devoid of context and absent of their consequences in the novel.<br /><br />So through a series of arresting images we see Dick Halloran leave Miami and voyage by plane, car and snowmobile to the Rockies, only to be immediately cut down, without serious investigation of why, or the tribulations and mental torment book describes in his getting there. We see Jack Torrance's yellow beetle crawling up to the Outlook, like a wasp to the nest, but not the dilapidated condition of the car, a state which, in King's novel, stands in for the state of Jack's mind and marriage. Jack's alcoholism is tangentially referred to, once, but is not otherwise explored. Shelley Duvall's Wendy is reduced to a feeble, shrieking wreck, without any of the strength or fortitude portrayed in the novel.  I am prepared to give Stanley Kubrick the benefit of the doubt and grant that this was entirely intentional. That isn't to say it is necessarily successful.<br /><br />The trouble is, I don't think Kubrick's approach, in this case, works - whereas it undoubtedly did in 2001. What we are left with is beautiful cinematography, disconcerting camera angles, a complex sound stage and high-budget production design, but little to ruminate on and nothing the quicken the pulse. It's occasionally spooky, but never scary. There are fine set pieces, but Kubrick seems almost deliberately to defuse the thrills, even down to the constant bright lighting with which he floods his sets.<br /><br />I concede this might be my prejudgement, based on knowledge of the novel - showing through. It may be that the back-story and metaphor Kubrick elected to omit dispel necessary tension and uncertainty in the motion picture.<br /><br />But The Shining didn't feel like it had enough substance left for me, and I didn't understand easily the point of Kubrick's cleverness with this directing. I was left with the sense that the Shining is a dated film, perhaps more an artefact of its time than a genuinely great film.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonsee Jack Torrance's yellow beetle crawling up to the Outlook, like a wasp to the nest, but not the dilapidated condition of the car, a state which, in King's novel, stands in for the state of Jack's mind and marriage.

B000YPUFA6|5.0|So, attempts to contain the T-virus to Raccoon City have failed. Great. Now the virus has spread throughout the world, and those who have not been effected yet live a life reminiscent of Mad Max. However, all hope is not lost when you have a saucy, zombie-butt kicking super woman wielding a set of kukri knives and telekinetic powers. Alice is back, and she's not happy.<br /><br />We learn just how evil and how large Umbrella is in Extinction. Dr. Isaacs is attempting to create a anti-virus of sorts that he hopes will domesticate the undead. I wouldn't call them domesticated, but they are now slightly smarter, stronger and significantly faster! Alice must pull out all the stops if she wishes to defeat the super undead, zombie crows, outlaws, and tentacles...yes, the infamous Tyrant makes an appearance.<br /><br />The majority of this movie takes place in well lit areas - an oddity for a zombie flick, but it works well. The speed and ferocity of the super undead makes up for the lack of the dark, claustrophobic confinements that we loved in the 2002 release. At times, it feels more like an action movie a la Apocalypse, but with a good dose of that good ol' Resident Evil suspense. Unlike Apocalypse, Extinction is a nice blend of action and horror that never departs from the moody Resident Evil universe.<br /><br />Picture quality is phenomenal. It rivals, if not surpasses, the brilliant 2002 release. This movie is a showpiece that every HD buff should own. Clarity, detail, and color is unrivaled. The audio will blow you away as well. Bass is tight and clean - crystal clear. I hope you have a good surround setup!<br /><br />The special features are what we have come to expect with a modern release, but with a twist. This Blu-ray uses picture in picture throughout the movie to show behind the scenes, art boards, and more. It is a very cool feature that I would like to see more of. Another notable feature is the 1080i, 30 minute, four part documentary about the film. As always, the filmmaker's commentary is insightful and revealing. There is no cast commentary this time, but it is not missed. Extinction easily has the best offering of special features in the trilogy.<br /><br />Extinction puts the Resident Evil series back on track. They have managed to achieve a perfect blend of action, horror, and suspense all while making the ballsy decision to set it in the daytime. The picture and audio quality alone warrants a rental if nothing else. Fans of the series owe it to themselves to pick up this movie asap!<br /><br />Tech Specs<br />Video: 1080p, 2.40:1<br />Audio: English, French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Portuguese, Spanish Dolby 5.1<br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese
0767903854|4.0|Unlike in his notes on England, written after years in the country, Bryson here only spends a matter of weeks and barely scratches the surface of what Australia has to offer.<br /><br />That said, I do believe there's no-one else who could possibly scratch the surface so skilfully.  His writing is fun and engaging as always.  Self-deprecation and humility throughout are nice things to see from a travel writer, and he does manage to meet some fascinating characters along the way.<br /><br />He drives home most skilfully his relatively simpleminded thesis that Australia is a fascinating place that we in the outside world don't pay enough attention to.  In fact, he says it over and over.  In fact, it's the final line of the book.<br /><br />At some point, I began to tire of his repeated pleasant surprises throughout the country.  I lost count of the number of museums he was dreading and then found to be unexpectedly wonderful.  I'm just not sure that every dusty obscure museum or landmark in Australia is as fascinating as every other one.<br /><br />Despite that, he does throw in enough anecdotes and humour to keep the reader entertained, if not educated on a very deep level beyond the simple fact that Australia is too vast to encapsulate in a single book, including this one.<br /><br />My biggest, in fact, perhaps only, disappointment (other than the fact that he never found a museum or attraction he didn't rave about!) is that he frequently mentions the Aboriginal history of Australia, and the modern-day state of the Aborigines, yet never went out of his way to actually find, meet, or speak with an Aborigine.<br /><br />It's as if he looked at them, considered their noble history, considered their modern plight, shrugged his shoulders, and walked away.<br /><br />I really wanted to know more.  I guess I needed Bryson to meet at least one person from this ancient and fascinating culture and see Australia through more than just European or North American eyes, just for a second.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE! Definitely one of my top favorites. It was a nice modern fairy tale that anyone will enjoy. I recommend it to everyone. Christina Ricci and James McAvoy give amazing performances!
0439023491|5.0|Throughought this book I kept thinking that if I had read it as a teenager, it would haunt me, and I would be unable to get it out of my head. As an adult, I appreciate the pace, the story, and the characters.  It doesn't talk down to teenagers, and it can keep adults engaged.<br /><br />To those who say this series is derivative, truly, most books are. It's a mark of excellence when a book (or a series) can take a premise that has been done before and make it feel fresh.  The Hunger Games series does that, and does it well.

1594488878|5.0|My knowledge of music is limited, meaning that it tends to depend on \\"what I like to listen to\\" versus \\"what I don't like to listen to.\\" I understand that there's a lot of great, thoughtful music out there that I just don't want to listen to when I'm out for a run, and I was initially wary of this book, because I thought it might be mocking of those who don't analyze music in a deeper way than, \\"I like that!\\"    Instead, this was a solid book about the different perspectives toward life, art, and relationships. The book was made stronger by its deviation from what most readers might have expected or wanted from the course of the story, but it forced me (at least) to think about how things are, instead of how I would want them to be, all pretty and wrapped up with a bow.    I will admit I was a little skeptical about how Hornby would handle a woman's perspective, but ultimately this book made me remember that \\"a woman's perspective\\" encompasses a whole universe of views, not just my own.  This was a great read that will stick with me.
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Bought a new Mac Pro for the office and my boss was quite upset to find that Apple has completely discontinued Firewire 400 support and as such, he was unable to use his incredibly over-priced iSight.  Ordered two of these so we could have a spare in the office, and it worked like a charm.  Immediately found the iSight through the Firewire 400 port in his monitor and was back in business. Two days later, my boss's daughter bought a new MacBook Pro and wanted to do a migration from her old White MacBook.  Target Disk Mode is incredibly useful, but without 800 on the MacBook or 400 on the MacBook  Pro, there was no way to connect them to each other to migrate her data, (except for Ethernet, but that has always broken why I've tried it).  The second adaptor I purchased, to the rescue!  They immediately recognized each other and the migration to her new MBP went extremely smoothly. And I looked the biggest bad ass in the mean time for having saved the day (albeit accidentally) by doubling up my original order. So moral of the story: Buy a couple, save the day.
1594488878|4.0|\\"Juliet, Naked\\" is a story about characters who discover they've wasted huge chunks of their lives being involved with each other, and realize that there's really nothing they can do about it.<br /><br />Duncan is one of a small group of die-hard fans who still love an obscure 80's rock star named Tucker Crowe.  Duncan considers himself a scholar, a \\"Crowologist,\\" and he curates a website and discussion forum where like-minded types can congregate.<br /><br />Annie has been dating Duncan for fifteen years.  She was twenty-five when she met him, and now she's forty, childless and running an unpopular museum in a seaside town called Gooleness.<br /><br />Tucker released a breakthrough album in 1986 called \\"Juliet,\\" an angry breakup record about his tumultuous relationship with a beautiful model.  But in the middle of the sold-out concert tour, he mysteriously walked away from his music and never appeared in public again.<br /><br />When Duncan gets hold of an unreleased demo version of \\"Juliet\\" and posts an ecstatic review on his website, Annie writes a dismissive one, mostly as a passive-aggressive attack on the boyfriend she's come to resent.  But this earns her an approving e-mail from Tucker, who loathes most of his fans, but reads their websites.<br /><br />As Annie begins a flirtatious, secret correspondence with Tucker, Duncan experiences a crisis of self-doubt about his lengthy obsession, and responds to it by having an affair with a colleague.  He immediately confesses to Annie, who throws him out of the house.<br /><br />Although Duncan and his friends weave a mystical narrative around Tucker's disappearance and his supposed descent into reclusive madness, the former star has actually dedicated the past twenty years to the mundane task of destroying a series of marriages and alienating a series of children.  Now he's past fifty and his cast-off families are demanding that he account for his behavior.  Like Annie, he wants a way out.<br /><br />As events bring Annie and Tucker closer, each hopes the other can provide an escape.  But Annie is unwilling to help Tucker run from his mistakes, and Tucker can't offer Annie the stable future she wants.  And when Duncan finally gets the chance to pull back the curtain on his Wizard of Oz, he finds no answers.<br /><br />The story reaches a confrontation, but never really finds a climax; these characters can't get back what they've lost, and none of them really has any way to resolve the problems the story presents.  Annie will probably never have the relationship or the children she wants, and certainly, she won't get them from Duncan or Tucker.  Duncan discovers that his lifelong study of Tucker Crowe has been a waste of time.  Tucker's total failure to turn any of these events into art is the book's final joke.<br /><br />As a longtime Hornby reader, I was fairly surprised by the harsh treatment of Duncan, who seems like an older, milder, nerdier version of Rob from \\"High Fidelity.\\"<br /><br />Compared to Hornby's previous obsessive-fanboy characters, Duncan's offenses are mild and his punishment is outsized.  He's not as snide or as mean as Rob, nor is he an arrested adolescent like Will from \\"About a Boy.\\"  Duncan is a bit self-centered and he's got an introvert's inability to read social cues, but Rob was a borderline sociopath, and was ultimately forgiven for it because he had good taste in music.<br /><br />Duncan's taste in music is tragically bad, much like Annie's taste in men.  By the end of the book, it's hard to believe that Tucker's music was ever very good.  Duncan believes he hears passion in \\"Juliet\\" that he doesn't know how to experience, and he tries to learn how to feel that by studying Tucker's life and music.  But Tucker's life is just as empty as Duncan's, and Duncan's futile intellectual search for the source of that kind of passion is ultimately as wasteful and destructive as Tucker's unthinking pursuit of his appetites.<br /><br />Redemption is alwayssort of qualified or twisted in Hornby's books, but \\"Juliet, Naked\\" is unusually bleak.  Annie doesn't have a clear path forward after her relationship with Duncan, and Duncan doesn't have a clear purpose once his illusions have been punctured.<br /><br />The book suggests that Duncan may rebuild his edifice on a foundation of self-deception, and Annie may follow Tucker to America.  But these are clearly bad choices that will only result in more pain and wasted time.Annie doesn't have a clear path forward after her relationship with Duncan, and Duncan doesn't have a clear purpose once his illusions have been punctured.

B000068VHP|3.0|This is a really well done album, but it lacks variety between the songs. If you are not paying attention, you will not even notice when one song ends and the next one begins. That being said, the music itself is beautiful. I have a very hard time understanding the lyrics, between the singing style and the accent, so that makes it hard for me to connect emotionally to the songs.<br /><br />J.Ja
6304925131|5.0|This is a story about a young new lawyer in a southern town in Tennessee. He takes the case of a young man who is dying of leukemia because his private insurance company refused treatment (a bone marrow transplant). This dramatic story tells how a powerful established law fiem can use tricks like wiretapping or bugging to sabotage a legal challenge. Their son dies, the parents continue the suit. [The film shows little of the personal lives of the people in this story.]    Matt Damon, the young lawyer, does all he can to gather the information needed to win his case against the privately owned insurance company. Why did a claims examiner suddenly \\"resign\\"? Was she sickened by her work in the insurance company? [Alcoholism just doesn't happen, its an industrial disease caused by corporations.] Jon Voight, the power in the corporation's law firm, shows his acting skills in the accented speech of that area. [All speakers of English have an accent, you don't notice your own.] The facts brought out in the dramatic trial result in a verdict for the plaintiff, plus $50 million in punitive damages. Is this too good to be true?    The private insurance company preys upon the working poor by using door-to-door salesmen to sell policies. These high costs drain money from the premiums. Are they only selling \\"peace of mind\\"? Will this private insurance company declare bankruptcy to get out of paying? Was the owner looting the firm? Was it all a scam to oppress working people and cheat them out of needed health care? Some may claim this is only a work of fiction, but these things will happen as long as we do not have government-run health insurance that is well-managed and affordable to avoid a tragedy like this. [Read the book \\"A Civil Action\\" for facts.]   You know what happened in the financial industry since the New Deal regulations were abolished over the last thirty years. [Could this story happen in Canada or England?] John Grisham wrote the novel \\"A Runaway Jury\\" that waschanged by Hollywood and turned into a big flop. Was the book changed for this movie?
B002EE583O|5.0|Back to the days of baggy pants and a lay back feel for the funky jamma. This album captures a generation and a century. Truly a classic throughout. \\"this is the one\\".
B001FB55H6|5.0|after viewing the standard release of this movie i was dissapointed with the editing  but on viewing the directors cut the movie gives the story so much more.i am always a firm believer that any movie would always be better when shown in it's full glory from the start.  Watchmen is the true comic book heroes,the story is excellant the photography and suspense all add up to one of the best hero movies out there, if you haven't seen it yet or you think it's not for you, you don't know what you're are missing.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|this is a lot better than magical mystery tour.you can hear everything that's going on and it sounds like your in the studio with the beatles.good job on this one
B00065MDRW|5.0|Have not heard this music in years. Lp version was worn out. Decided on a CD, figuring that remixing would make the sound awesome. Was awesome when it first came out. Unfortunatly modern updating did not enhance the sound much. Still this KC album is their best, and am once again enjoying this breakthrough concept. Nice to hear a pre-Emerson, Lake, and Palmer Greg Lake on vocals.
B0025KVLTW|4.0|the music is great and the clarity is good but there seem's to be a lack of bass volume on the first half of the disc.it may have been that way on the original and i just don't remember but overall pretty good

What I can say is that : I WILL ALWAYS LOVE... HER !
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I bought this dvd for a friend. We both watched it and this dvd is GREAT, the music fills the room to make you want to dance. My friend is a true Michael Jackson fan, and he would definately purchase this item had I not purchased it for him already. This is one of the best concerts of MJ's on dvd that I have seen. I, too, would recommend this dvd for everyone that loves MJ's songs.
B000N3AWDE|5.0|I have always loved Celine, and when i had overdosed on her magnificent english material, i thought i'd give her french career a try, i'm so glad i did! this is my favorite Celine album of all time. Everything is perfect. the lyrics, the vocals, and the emotions poured out.    Every song is amazing, my absolute favorite is the instant classic on s'est aimé a cause, other highlights are la diva, the incredibly heartbreaking je ne suis pa celle, the beautiful Si J'etais quelq'un and the gorgeous closer Berçeuse    This is an absolute gorgeous album and it's one of my favorites of all time. I listen to it all the time.    Bravo Celine!
0385504225|5.0|The book was very good. It kept my interest to the point where I found myself reading through the late hours of morning. I am impressed with the length of his book along with the associations he made in regards to noetic science and modern civilization. This subject alone being covered will pave a new idea and road for such which is a very plausible approach to leading human intelligence towards enlightenment and hope where it wasn't noticed before.     The immense research Dan Brown has done that shows in his book is simply astounding! Never have I read a novel so full of very real studies and research. The only downside to the book is I guessed where the ancient word was hidden when \\"As above, so below\\" was mentioned the first time in the book.     Other than that, this book is amazing and is definitely worth reading. I even found myself looking up the information in his book, making for much more educational interest. This book, other than being a fantastic read, is also a eye opener for those willing to question their beliefs and perceptions. Those that are not capable of doing so will be noticed in the ridiculously picky and merciless reviews as it mirrors such and emotional response. But then again that's what was so good about Davinci Code.  Other than Digital Fortress this is his best piece yet in my humble opinion. Read it!
B002JTMNX2|1.0|This is not Foreigner! This is the Mick Jones Solo Project. For Jones to call this Foreigner is a crime unto itself. There is not one original member playing with Jones. Could you imagine Page going out by himself and calling it Zep? Call it what it is Jones and I can have some respect for you! Oh wait, if you did that no one would buy the cd. Sorry, good, bad or indifferent I refuse to support a project that is a lie.
0765348276|4.0|Perhaps Cory Doctorow described it best when he wrote, \\"Old Man's War is Starship Troopers without the lectures and Forever War with better sex.\\"  That just about says it all, though it speaks more to the juvenile nature of the sex in Forever War than to any sex which may be present in Old Man's War, which is pretty negligible.<br /><br />An elderly widower, with little else to live for, joins the army.  At the time, many elderly humans join the Colonial Defense Force because of the promise of a return to their youth.  The Colonials are apparently technologically superior, owning the secret for interstellar travel (the skip drive) as well as the secret for eternal youth.<br /><br />While the science in this novel is outstanding and the premise is good, much of the dialogue is contrived and trite.  This is the first in a series of three novels and well worth proceeding to the second, The Ghost Brigades.
B0029NY9YO|2.0|I'm a fan of comics and comic movies, but I didn't like this one.  Too slow and not for the younger fans.  Too adult oriented and not a very good movie at all.
B0009RCPX4|5.0|i was very happy with this product and it was a gift for my son
B001GCUNYO|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and absolutely enjoyed it. It had me on the edge of the seat for more than half the movie.  Some parts of this movie is somewhat unbelieveable - but hey, that's what entertainment is all about.  Lots of action, fast-paced, and if you liked the last three Jason Bourne movies (Borne Identity, Ultimatum, Supremacy), then your bound to like this. It was good enough to make me spring for the blu-ray to recreate that theater experience once again.
B001G8NW6Y|5.0|This book in no way should be read by any 'progressive' who wishes to remain one!  If you read with any openmindedness at all, you will be moved inexorably toward an appreciation of the ability of the free market to improve the lives of people in any society that values and practices it.  Your faith in government to solve economic problems will be shattered as you begin to see how non-market 'solutions', no matter how well intended, exacerabate these problems in the real world.    Written over 60 years ago, Hazlitt's work is remarkably prescient and applicable today.  Along with very relatable examples, I found his reasoning to be clear, concise, and sound.  It is very readable and understandable for non-economists.  Seems the economic fallicies that people mistakenly believe today are essentially the same ones from 1946, or 1846, or 1746...or for that matter... from 46.  Just slap a new coat of paint on 'em and your ready to fool a whole new generation of victims.  In this respect, Hazlitt makes a great paint stripper.
0439023491|5.0|Besides the fact that the book I bought was new but cheap(eventhough it is a new release) it was in really good shape... I got it on time as scheduled; since I was desperate to get my hands on it my waiting time was acceptable.  It was a great experience buying from Amazon.  Now, the book itself is great!!!  Suzanne has great imagination and creativity... lots of suspense, action, humor, a little violence and a hint of romance. Although you can have a feeling of how it's going to end, it is compleatly unexpectable how it will happen or when or even why.  The story has twists and turns that will take by surprise the reader and the cliffhanger end is killing me... definetly want to know when the next book will come out!

B00000ILGL|4.0|The Velvet Underground reference one reviewer made is the key.   Giorgio Moroder is as influential as any band.   Like the VU album, it may not have stormed the charts but most who heard the Moroder sound took something from it.  In 1977 no-one had heard of seemless dance mixes on albums, pulsating sequencers, spacy atmospheric synths, metronomic electronic rhythms.   Everyone can see the link to house and trance music (you could subtitle this album \\"Modern Dance Music Began Here\\"), but as someone much more into guitar bands Moroder had an equally huge influence on alternative and pop bands.   Any band old and new who wanted to add a dance edge, hard rhythm or icy electronics to their sound looked no further (artists as diverse as Abba, ELO, Goldfrapp, New Order, NIN, Eurhythmics, YYYs, Killing Joke).   Also Moroder definitely influenced Kraftwerk.   Their next album \\"Man Machine\\" has some very Moroder sounding tracks like \\"The Robots\\" and \\"Spacelab\\".       The only slightly dated stuff is the vocals, but they generally gel fine in a sort of late 70s way.   The music is timeless.
0385504225|1.0|On a flight from Rome to DC this book was my companion.  It was engaging until the last portion, when I realized that the foundation for the entire plot was extremely wanting and the expenditure of my time was unsatisfying.  The idea is pitiful that a new age of world peace will usher upon us all based on the breaking of a wax seal on an old box, or knowing that a bible is under a cornerstone of the Washington Memorial, or knowing that there can be multiple layers of meaning in the bible, or knowing that there can be divinity in each of us.  There is really nothing new or earthshaking about any of these ideas. Likewise, the idea that many top leaders of our nation would risk their lives to protect the BIG SECRET, that a copy of the Bible is under a cornerstone, is absurd.  While quiet medication (as Brown presents the Masonics to practice) is probably helpful for most, busy people hardly have time to place life-and-death priority on protecting secrets that are no secrets at all.  Even if Brown goals was to slam the Masonics as preoccupied with secrets of no significance (and I am not a Masonic), the best I can say about this book is \\"much ado about nothing.\\"
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Don't let all the bad reviews make up your mind for you. Watch it and make your own decision. I was hesitant to get this on blu-ray because of the negative reviews for it. I don't see what every one is talking about. This looks very good on blu-ray the picture quality is awesome .(after you get past the title sequence)
0670451495|5.0|I haven't seen this book in a hard cover edition in years!  Love it!  I bought it as a gift for a 1 year old and I am glad I bought more than 1 copy. (Maybe I will be a grandma some day).  This story and also \\"Blueberries for Sal\\" are among my own childhood favorites.  Now they remind me of a gentler story time.  It has no \\"whiz bang\\" hyper speed of so many of today's children's stories.  I would recommend this lovely book to anyone who wants a quality book that can be read repeatedly to many children.
B0019NB9P2|3.0|This installment plays exactly like a longer TV episode--so-so plot added to TV like editing and sadly, TV like special effects;  Now I remember how ripped off I felt when I paid theatrical version money to see this in theaters years back;  That said, the Blu-Ray transfer looks just great--very sharp with good contrast;  At the time of this writing the individual Blu Ray was not out just yet but this episode was included in the boxed Blu Ray set...
B0006L0LOS|2.0|I hadn't seen this movie in awhile, so I guess in memory it seemed like it was actually worth watching... definitely not the case.  Fortunately I purchased it used for cheap.      This movie was an absolute waste.  I'm not sure the tone they were trying to set... sexy was definitely one angle and Halle Berry is hot... but if they were trying to go for edgy or action packed, that was much less successful.  First, Halle Berry plays her role way too \\"cute\\".  Definitely the opposite of Michelle Phieffer's interpretation in the Batman movie.  There was also way too much use of CGI in the action sequences which was too jarring.  However, tehre was some pretty cool martial arts type movies here and there.  Just not enough to warrant watching the other 85 minutes of movie surrounding them.
B0024FAR5W|5.0|My husband asked me to order the 1st season for him. He got hooked on it while working a construction job in Okalahoma.  When he got home, we watched the whole 1st season in a weekend.  We are now both hooked and do not miss Tuesday nights when Sons of Anarchy shows at 10 pm on FX!  I recommend this DVD to anyone who is over the age of 18.  Enjoy!
B00000IQW3|5.0|Watching this movie is great, if for no other reason to remember back when analog 15\\" CRT monitors and 400 baud modems were considered cutting edge.     Movies like this and Wargames also remind me how, even as recently as the 80s, you can have a fun movie that didn't involve hyper-sexualized teens dressed like Megan Fox in Transformers.  Rather, you have a plot driven movie that played on the kind of innocent wonder back in the day about how technology would change people's lives and lead to a new future.      The CGI used in the film looks exceedingly dated, but I remember when this film and Tron came out, I thought it was cool as heck.  Admittedly, some parts of the movie are a bit cheesy, but if you can ignore that this movie is a great example of an 80's sci fi classic.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|The first four songs are one of the best introductions to a band that I've heard on record. They come out rocking and immediately draw you in without relent. Everything just hits at once, the vocals, music and the passion. Listen to the words and you realize that these aren't things 20-somethings usually sing about. (as far as I know) Perhaps there's a maturity here that puts the band above others.    OK, time to take a break from the onslaught for a minute. On \\"When It Rains\\" Hayley gives us a great Andrea Corr sound on the chorus. Nice backing vocals, beautiful song.    \\"Crushcrushcrush\\" - Another good rocker with a few changes thrown in. The video reminds me of Hyde's \\"Seasons Call\\".  When Hayley sings the lines \\"I need something to sing about\\", \\"Give me something to sing about\\" it almost comes across as a challenge.    \\"We Are Broken\\" - Another break from the rockers with some nice piano. Sounds like something U2 could have done.    \\"Fences\\" is definitely the curve ball on the record. At first listen you may not be sure if it works or not but after a while you realize that it does. A nice change of pace and shows another side of the band.    By the time you get to \\"Born For This\\" a similarity will have been noticed. This song seems like an add on at times but was probably needed as a closer. That being said, the disc moves and plays quickly. You don't realize that's it's already gone by and you've heard a lot of music.    On a production note, they could have pulled back on the levels a little bit, especially the 1K band. I'm all for pushing the volume level but parts of this disc cross over into distortion, particularly Hayley's voice.
0385504225|4.0|I found the story line very similar to the The Da Vinci Code and in that I was disappointed.    The story did hold my interest, although there were times I wish it would move forward. There were the twists and turns similar to those found in the The Da Vinci Code, but I felt they were not as clever. Maybe this was because I started to reflect on the spiritual part of the story more than the story itself. I usually reflect on what a story is saying, however, it seem more intense for me this time.    No matter, I am glad I listen to the book and would do so again. If you want a good story to read or listen to, I would recommend tis book.
B0021L8UXU|4.0|Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) has always been a highly phobic loner, which stood him in good stead for the onslaught of the zombie virus. He's got a few rules that help him survive.  Among them are cardio because if you're not in shape you cannot outrun the zombies, fasten your seatbelt, and don't be a hero.      He meets Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) on the way from his college in Austin, TX to his home in Columbus.  The mismatched pair opt to travel together until Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) cheat them out of their car and eventually con them into traveling to California because they believe an amusement park is the last bastion of civilization.     They battle their way across country on the quest for supplies and Twinkies to ease Tallahassee's odd craving.  In their travels, they encounter only one other live person Bill Murray (himself).  Along the way, Columbus learns how to \\"nut up\\" (in Tallahassee's parlance) and be a part of their loosely knit unit.      I'm not generally a fan of horror, but the trailers to this film sucked me in and I'll honestly say Zombieland was just as funny as the trailers promised.  There are heavy sections of zombie-splatter, but nothing disturbed me badly enough to leave.  By the time the film was done, I had laughed so hard my sides ached and I just left for the mundane world feeling a whole lot lighter.  Yes, there is a light romance line between Columbus and Wichita, but there's more of a family feel to the odd quartet's relationship.      Strongly recommended for fans of comedy and campy horror.     Rebecca Kyle, October 2009

1569242739|5.0|I am a fairly newbie (4 months and counting) \\"almost\\" vegan (still eat fish)and have been purchasing as many cookbooks as possible to get a handle on how to veganize my diet with a particular focus on baking. SO grateful to have discovered Isa and Terry's vegan cookbooks (have Veganomicon and Vegan with a Vengeance).   They are all informative, interesting to read, sassy (!) and simple. I love love love to bake and am fairly adept at revamping a recipe to be more healthy (i.e. swap applesauce for oil, whole wheat pastry flour for all purpose etc) but was at a loss on how to veganize anything.      This little cupcake handbook is absolutely fantastic. the size is compact and small; you can throw it in your bag and read it on the subway! The pages are sturdy and with appealing glossy photos. the forward is very succinct, well organized, interesting and contains a great executive summary on the ins/outs of vegan cupcake baking. There is a very wide variety of flavors and textures represented so you wont get bored and there is something for everyone. The recipes are very simple and once you gain confidence; they are easily adaptable to make it more your own. i saw some negative posts about how the recipes are not healthy and contain too much refined sugar. so change it then! I have decreased the amounts of sugar to suit my less sweet taste, sub'd agave for white sugar, used whole wheat pastry flour exclusively, swapped out soy milk for almond milk  -all with great results. just experiment!     I highly highly recommend this book. I've tested a few recipes on my non-vegan husband who has huge sweet tooth and he gives it a double thumbs up. I've already pre-ordered the cookie version!    Happy baking!

0385504225|3.0|Diving into \\"The Lost Symbol\\" was much like jumping into the deep end of a murky swimming pool.  You're expecting it to be cool and refreshing, somewhat familiar, but... once you're down under, you realize that this is your neighbor's pool and though it's still a bit comforting, it's not exactly what you expected.<br /><br />Welcome in the third book in the \\"DaVinci Code\\" trilogy.  Robert Langdon is a symbologist professor who is known world wide because of his efforts to save the Vatican City during the previous two books.  He is smart, funny, and really really cynical.  He usually has ties to very religious people, though is still able to separate himself from their beliefs and his own findings.  Langdon has remained true to his beliefs and experiences through \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\".  In \\"The Lost Symbol\\", Langdon is duped into traveling last minute to a conference where he will be giving a speech on symbology at the capital of the USA for very important people.  Upon his arrival there, he quickly finds out that there is something terribly wrong.  The CIA is involved, as well as his dear friend's amputated hand- which lies in the middle of a very important conference room floor.  The chase is on and \\"The Lost Symbol\\" carries out the course of just over one day's time.<br /><br />\\"The Lost Symbol\\" carried the same character ideas as \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\", but it didn't follow the same criteria.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" actually had LESS symbology in it than the other two in this trilogy.  \\"Symbol\\" also had a lot more of a religious lecture to it.  While the other two books felt like they were analysing in order to learn, this one was a bit preachy... especially nearing the end.<br /><br />\\"Symbol\\" felt like a thriller, more than detective work.  While \\"DaVinci\\" and \\"Angels\\" kept me GLUED to my seat so that I could learn what the world meant, I could put \\"Symbol\\" down for DAYS and still not feel like I was missing anything important.<br /><br />As a whole, instead of as the third book in a trilogy, \\"Symbol\\" was interesting.  It still dissects current day philosophy and pushes you to re-evaluate your thoughts.  It still has the enchanting characters that you absolutely hate the villan, love the heroine, and of course Langdon is always fun to watch (love cynicism).  Some of the story was a bit... much, though.  It turned into a bit of a murder mystery by the middle of the book and I was losing count of the bodies- none of the bodies were important characters, though.  As in \\"Angels\\", most everyone who died was special in some way.<br /><br />Wait, I said I wasn't going to compare the three books.  But, it's hard NOT to.  I read the first two and was expecting the same formula and the same abilities.  \\"Symbol\\" was... entertaining, but... it was a bit of a let down.  Instead of non-fiction/ science fiction, I got thriller/ murder mystery-<br />[even a bit of \\"fantasy\\" to me. He starts talking about souls and spirits, etc]<br /><br />\\"The Lost Symbol\\" is worth the read... just maybe at a discounted price... in softcover.  I can DEFINITELY wait on the $1 rental of this movie, if it ever comes out, rather than going to the theatre.as the third book in a trilogy, \\"Symbol\\" was interesting.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Other reviews have said it all.  This BBC adaption is simply excellent!  The class conflict in the story makes it worth watching.  Excellent casting as well.    I can't say which one I like better - this TV adaption or the original novel.  I love them both.    Read Elizabeth Gaskell's original novel.  Her work deserves more attention.
B002GOAH1U|4.0|I liked the fact that I could what this movie with my grand daughter with no fear of unnecessary foul language or nude scenes. Need more movies for younger children to watch with grandparents. The movie was cute but a bit predictable. It was entertaining and I would rate it alone with \\"B\\" movies.
B002DYKP8S|5.0|Some of these reviews made me laugh out loud, they were so ludicrous. Yes, I'm a techno-nerd too, with reference-quality A/V gear. But most of these hapless reviewers are really missing the point. By a mile. If I took this attitude, I'd never go to see a film again, listen to a concert or ever buy another BluRay. Get over it, guys and - by the way - FYI the vast majority of surround sound systems suck anyway- as anyone with the merest knowledge of phsychoacoustics could attest.    So, let's get down to basics and the things that do actually matter. My wife (who is Chinese) and I sat down in front of our Kuro Reference and had a great time. We listened to the 'lowly' 5.1 Putonghua track, of course, and were not bothered one whit.    This is a great wushu epic with charismatic actors, stunning locations, decent CGI and - above all- fabulous cinematography.    And the transfer to BluRay is decent. Not great, but way, way better than the ham-fisted debacle that was 'Flying Daggers'.    What more do you want?    Lighten up, guys!
0385341008|1.0|I'm interested in the wartime history of the Channel Islands and had this book highly recommended by a friend, so I really wanted to like it. Alas, I couldn't get past the first few pages because Juliet's voice seemed so patently wrong for the time and place--falsely perky, quirky, and girlish. She comes across as the product of a sentimental American writer's imagination (a Julie Andrews figure), not a product of Britain before and during the war. Perhaps the author developed a character that she grew so fond of that she didn't ever ask herself whether the character really fitted the setting.<br /><br />And maybe the book gets better and more complex later on, but I was too queasy to stick around and find out.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Great concert!!!  Watched the DVD twice in a row, then again with my husband when he got home from work.  He liked it, too!  So worth having, I'll watch it over and over.  I'll also share it with my family and friends!
B000784WMW|5.0|This is without a doubt the very best production of Jane Eyre out there.  Timothy Dalton is an excellent Mr. Rochester -- darkly handsome, passionate -- an extremely troubled man searching for purity, truth -- and for a mate who is his equal.  He finds what he is looking for when the quiet, yet fiercely independent and passionate Jane Eyre (brilliantly played by Zelah Clarke) comes to his home to be governess to Mr. Rochester's young ward. These two actors have caught the spirit of this gothic novel and viewers are in for a real treat!

0385504225|3.0|With Dan Brown's writing there is no finesse, subtleness, or creativity in revealing the plot lines/secrets. Dan Brown is like an Arnold Schwarzenegger Terminator rather than a Richard Attenborough's Cry Freedom.    Yet, like a Schwarzenegger movie, Brown is a good story teller and it is difficult not to enjoy his novels. Of course his views on Christianity and the Bible is ludicrous but they are now quite irrelevant. In fact in this book Brown simply blends in with the general view of our culture regarding Christianity and the Bible. He is obsessed with the world of suppressed secrets and religious freedom - freedom to have any belief and still be credible. The Lost Symbol focuses upon the Freemason's and the search for the pyramid which will lead to a Masonic `map' which in turn leads to the revelation of the all powerful `word'.  Washington DC is the  center of this plot. A city riddled with secret meanings. The main `bad' guy is Mal'akh, a man who is intent upon discovering this all powerful `word' and thus be given power beyond belief. He is violent, angry, clever and ruthless in his quest. Robert Langdon is drawn into the plot deceptively, as is the CIA.    I will not give away any plot spoilers, so you will have to decide whether or not to buy the book or borrow the book, and read it for yourself. Is it a profitable thing to spend a day or so reading this book? I am not sure. It depends if you refer an Arnold Schwarzenegger or a Richard Attenborough classic.
1573229725|4.0|Sarah Waters never dissapoints. She has a profound way of describing her characters with such amazing imagery that you can't help but feel like you know them. Very few authors grab my attention to the extreme that she does - I can't seem to get enough of her writing style!<br /><br />I ordered Affinity and can't wait to dive in! I definitely recommend this book, it has moved up on my list of faves... it's right up there with Ms. Water's Tipping the Velvet.

B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is an absolutely addictive series I recently discovered on PBS, and I am SO delighted that it will be released on DVD soon!  If you have ever been a fan of BBC shows, then you will quickly discover that this wonderful cast of characters includes quite a number of faces you will recognize (Julia Sawalha, Olivia Hallinan, Brendan Coyle and Dawn French, among many others.)  Good writing, good acting....can't live without it!
B00001W9G0|5.0|An old stand by - classic - I had on VCR tape and bought on DVD.  I have loved this for years and always will.  The music, the Streisand/Redford connection is just awesome!  Cant say enough about it!  This will always be a favorite I am sure!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book.  The long delay due to all of the research Dan Brown was doing for the book raised my expectations.  I feel cheated.  Granted his last two books Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code are hard to follow behind, but I really expected more.  About 2/3 through the book, I wanted to just throw in the towel, but I kept reading hoping that it would get better. It doesn't get better.  Save your money.  If you must read it go to the library.  No more Dan Brown for me, I'm going back to Steve Berry and James Rollins.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|You can call Porcupine Tree prog if you want, but this isn't a prog band in the classic sense.  Those that are, like early outfits Yes, ELP and latter day Dream Theatre had one fatal flaw in my book:  they just didn't know when to quit noodling and write a real song.  If there's one thing I can't stand, it's gratuitous soloing that does nothing to help a tune.  PT are much more a classic rock band that borrows from Pink Floyd, Alan Parsons, a hint of Blue Oyster Cult and modern metal for a unique sound that should make them huge U.S. stars, but unfortunately haven't broken beyond cult status.<br />  \\"The Incident\\", a one piece set that supposedly details a car accident and its aftermath, is broken into segments, some brutally heavy, such as the opening slamming chords, quiet, and wistful, as in \\"Time Flies\\", the centerpiece of the CD.  As always, Steve Wilson delivers with smooth vocals and keyboardist extraordinaire Richard Barbieri adds the awesome synth and keyboards that are just as much a trademark of the PT sound as Wilson's vocals and stinging guitar work.<br />  Disc two contains a few non-related tunes, and are great songs as well, making \\"The Incident\\" a good bang for the buck.  Now it's time for Steve Wilson's buddy Mikael Akerfeldt of the astonishing Opeth to answer back with a follow-up to the criminally brilliant \\"Watershed\\".
0810993139|5.0|When I first saw this book, I was wondering why I was about to read something that looked like it was intended for my seven year old sister. As a matter of fact, my little sister actually bought this book to read over the summer and so when it was assigned in my reading list for my Young Adult Literature class, I was extremely curious as to what I could possibly learn from it. As a college student, I was somewhat skeptical.     \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid' is by far, the most delightful book I have ever read. Jeff Kinley did an incredible job in being both charming and amusing in this fun-filled book. With each page, you feel your heart warm and become fond of the main character, Gregory, and you grow with him as he faces the trials of a student in middle school. From facing bullies to getting an odd part in the school play, Gregory takes you back to the days of middle school and helps you reminisce through those youthful years.     I absolutely loved this book. It's a very quick read but still enjoyable and meaningful. The book is in a Diary format; dates, entries, etc. Complete with cartoons and drawings by the Diary's owner, Gregory. He shares his daily experiences in middle school that involve his \\"girl encounters\\", desire to be more popular, successful, independent, attractive, and more involved. With each entry, smiling is not easily avoided. Don't let this \\"juvenile-looking\\" book fool you; it is absolutely hilarious and will have you laughing every single page. I know I did, and I don't easily laugh out loud through books.     I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. If you are looking for a book that you can share with your child, this is definitely the one. Readers of all ages will fall in love with the Wimpy Kid and his Diary.

B002M2T1UO|5.0|I've been waiting for this box set for a long time. I expected to pay at least twice as much. $108 for 29 DVDs is a very sweet deal.
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|Wow...just wow...where to start?! Let me say that I have been a fan of theirs since BSB first came on the scene (we're talking concerts, ALL their cd's, etc - I've even met the guys, who are great btw) I'm still a fan and they are one of the only bands who cd I buy on release day, but I must say this is the first album I'm a bit disappointed in. I understand wanting to make a pop cd these days means dance songs but these songs (and their lyrics) are beneath, I think, the audience they started with in the beginning - I think the younger, newer, fans will probably enjoy this album more than ones who've been following the guys for awhile. I enjoy dance songs as much as the next person but BSB is known for making a great ballad and bringing out their beautiful harmonies and that aspect seems to be lost on this album. They aren't a \\"clubbin'\\" band so while it's great to see them getting in touch with their roots and going with some more upbeat music an entire album of songs that sound similar to each other just doesn't captivate me as much as some of their previous albums. I'm glad to have them back but I'm hoping the next album wont make them out to be a bunch of boys - as they are now men.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|For the die hard fans of the books, I would not suggest watching this movie at all. There are very few scenes in the movie that stay true to the book. Along with poor acting on some parts, and whimsical thrown in scenes, this is by far the worst Harry Potter movie to date. If you choose to watch it, simply because you are a die hard fan, then be prepared to be greatly disappointed to find your heroes thrown out of their classic telling as we know and love them and into motion pictures version of them.

B001KVZ6F2|4.0|I actually bought this movie for my dad. I heard it was good from many people and so I bought it. In the beginning, the story is somewhat unclear, but just give it a chance, it will get better. I promise! Also, in some parts, I had a hard time hearing Clint Eastwood speaking so I just turned on subtitles and was able to understand the movie better. The movie was worth watching at least once.
B002D4J8RC|1.0|I see it's listed for at least $5 cheaper; that sucks.  Plus the fact that all their best songs are remixes.  You need to specify this when selling the product.  I'm returning mine today.
B002KAJ0AO|4.0|Two years after \\"Unbreakable\\" came out, the Backstreet Boys come back with \\"This is Us,\\" another album where Kevin Richardson is absent.  With this album, the group wanted to try something different.  Instead of sticking to more pop rock sounding ballads, the group went to a more dance/r&b vibe.  Instead of having eight out of the eleven songs sounding like pop rock ballads, its the reverse this time.  Below is a rating of each song individually.    1) Straight Through My Heart: The first single, Straight Through My Heart is a solid dance song.  It has a beat that is easy to dance to and the vocals of the group are very pleasant. The song didn't chart well on the Hot 100, and I don't know why. But I like it: 9.5/10    2) Bigger: This is said to be the second single from the group. Although I like the song in terms of its vocals and musical background, I'm not sure if it will do well on the charts.  Overall, the song deserves a chance: 8.5/10    3) Bye Bye Love: With a dance/r&b tune, Bye Bye Love has a great tune to it. Also, the vocals within the song are top notch.  The only problem I see is it sounds a bit like Chris Brown's \\"Forever.\\" Only a little though, but Bye Bye Love is better:9/10    4) All of Your Life (You Need Love): Similar to STMH, All of Your Life is a dance song. I actually like this a little better than STMH because it has more energy.  Overall, this song showcases the vocal talent and production of BSB: 10/10.    5) If I Knew Then: This song takes an R&B vibe. Its a good song, but not too exciting, so its not one of my favorites: 7.5/10.    6) This is Us: This is Us, the song named after the album, is a classic ballad. Beautiful vocals, great vocal organization, and great instrumentals. What the Backstreet Boys are known for: 10/10    7) PDA: Although this song probably would do well on the charts, I don't like it too much. It has a good beat, but the lyrics are not really what BSB would usually sing about: 7/10.    8) Masquerade: Mixing dance, r&b, and electronica, Masquerade is one of the best songs on the album.  Would do extremely well if it was released as a single: 10/10.     9) She's a Dream: This song really doesn't measure up to the other songs on the album. I think it should of not been placed on the album; Trouble should of.  Overall this song lacks any enthusiasm: 5/10.    10) Shattered: Another classic ballad, Shattered hits all the right notes. Great vocals and instrumentation make it single worthy: 10/10.    11) Undone: Undone is a good song, but it sounds more like a ballad from Nsync aside from AJ's unique voice.  Overall, a solid song, but it could be a little more interesting: 7.5/10.     Conclusion: The Backstreet Boys came back with another solid, but different approach to their music. Most of the songs on the album offer excellent vocals, excellent instrumentation, and excellent arrangement. I give this album a 4.2/5.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|So, I know that I'm a BSB fan, but I will try to not sound like a 15 year-old girl who has pics of Kevin and Nick all over her wall! LOL!<br /><br />First off, this album has the best production value since \\"Millenium\\". What I mean by that is, every song flows smoothly into the next one. The power ballad goes into a mid-temp crooner melody that flows into a club-ready dance anthem, and it all sounds natural.<br /><br />That being said, this is not their best album (that would be \\"Black and Blue, in my opinion). But, after 13 years of being on the scene it is an album that shows the group is just as convincing as they were when they first stepped out in August 1997 (for the US fans, at least). It also quiets the skeptics who may be wondering why the group is still around. The sound of the album is flawless, with only not a single off-putting song, or substandard melody. It's a top-notch album. The only downfall may be that the sound is a departure from the sugary tunes they're known for (but, newsflash, they've been departing from that since \\"Never Gone\\"). And, while there are still some that are quick to criticize 4 grown men crooning about never letting their love go, give a listen to the clever composition and lyrical genius that this album brings. Then, I'll take any critique you may have.<br /><br />Now, the album opens with the current single, \\"Straight Through My Heart,\\" which was expertly chosen to introduce the group's new musical direction. If you liked this song, you've got a taste of where the album is going. Most of the album shows that BSB has quite skillfully researched the current pop scene, and they've realized those sugary pop beats from the late 90's are no longer prevalent. But rather, they've joined the rest of the Top 40 crowd, singing songs laced with that pop/R&B conglomerate that Rhianna, Beyonce, and Chris Brown have been popularizing in the recent year. The songs sound relevant, and still you've got that harmony the group has made infamous.<br /><br />The best songs on the album not only showcase that these four men not only still have it, but can do it just as well, if not better than, their younger counterparts. The album also sounds tour worthy. You can almost see the choreography and the pyrotechnics as you listen through the album. Which is a good thing--as they are a great performing group!<br /><br />To be quite honest, as stated earlier, there's not a sour note in the album. It's not only a testament to the group, but to the production team and studio backing. The group delivers a great pop album that may show, even the haters, that this group deserves all the accolades awarded to them in their 13+ year career.<br /><br />Listen to: \\"Straight Through My Heart\\", \\"Masquerade,\\" \\"Bigger,\\" \\"Undone,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" and \\"This Is Us.\\"n the album not only showcase that these four men not only still have it, but can do it just as well, if not better than, their younger counterparts.

And also, you should \\"hunt\\" for the Bonus CD Disc Version of \\"This is Us\\" as this bonus disc is a great stand alone album itself. (not the DVD)      1. \\"Straight Through My Heart\\" Written By: (AJ Junior, Kinnda Hamid, Bilal Hajji, Novel Jannusi) Produced By: (RedOne) -- 3:27  10/10- Produced by Redone (who produced Lady Gaga's Just Dance & Poker Face) a great uptempo song that has shades of Airwave by Rank 1     2. \\"Bigger\\" Written By: (Max Martin, Tiffany Amber and Shellback) Produced By: (Max Martin) -- 3:16  8/10- Max Martin....has produced so many BSB hits (I want it That way, etc..)...as well as so many other pop stars mid-tempo..great song..needs a dance remix to make it monster huge    3. \\"Bye Bye Love\\" Written By: (Carsten Schack, Kenneth Karlin and Claude Kelly) Produced By: (Soulshock & Karlin) -- 4:20  8/10 toe tapping - very reminiscent of Chris Brown's \\"Forever\\"     4. \\"All of Your Life (You Need Love)\\" Written By: (RedOne, Prince Charles) Produced By: (RedOne) -- 3:55  9.5/10 Another RedOne hot single..very very catchy uptempo song    5. \\"If I Knew Then\\" Written By: (Carsten Schack, Kenneth Karlin and Claude Kelly) Produced By: (Soulshock & Karlin) -- 3:16  10/10- AJ showcasing some great vocals...very catchy    6. \\"This is Us\\" Written By: (Howie Dorough, Jim Jonsin and Jordan Omley) Produced By: (Jim Jonsin) -- 3:03  6/10 my least favorite maybe my grade is too harsh, as it stands out from the whole album, and not in the best way..but still good..just something about it doesn't sit right.    7. \\"PDA\\" Written By: (Printz Board & Mario \\"Tex\\" James) Produced By: (Printz Board) -- 3:48  9.5/10 cliched..but SO good..reminds me of the catchiness of \\"Get Another Boyfriend\\" mixed with Asher Roth \\"She Don't Wanna Man\\"    8. \\"Masquerade\\" Written By: (Brian Kennedy, Alexander James, Busbee and Antwoine Collins) Produced By: (Brian Kennedy) -- 3:03  8.5/10 another uptempo song..this will be a great gym song for the workout    9. \\"She's a Dream\\" Written By: (AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Brian Littrell, T-Pain) Produced By: (T-Pain) -- 3:58  9/10 R&B heavy ballad..great for the quiet night with you and your other..      10. \\"Shattered\\" Written By: (Tiyon \\"TC\\" Mack, Chad Roper, Jordan Suecof, Daryl Camper) Produced By: (Eman) -- 3:53  10/10 One of BSB's best ballads hands down..brilliance!    11. \\"Undone\\" Written By: (Ryan Tedder, Josh Hoge, Troy Johnson ) Produced By: (Troy Johnson) -- 4:14  8/10 very nice ballad..by Tedder who was responsible for Leona Lewis' \\"Bleeding Love\\"       And for the Bonus tracks:quick ratings..I don't know why Funny Face, Hologram, Fallen Angel, Trouble, and Helpless weren't on the album..this CD is great enough to be a wonderful stand alone CD..    2-01 All In My Head  9/10  2-02 Callin' Your Name  7/10  2-03 Don't Try This At Home 8/10  2-04 Fallen Angel 10/10  2-05 Funny Face 10/10  2-06 Helpless 10/10  2-07 Hologram 10/10  2-08 International Luv 8/10   2-09 Straight through my heart (Jason Nevins mixshow remix)  2-10 Trouble 10/10      All in all a great album.....great, fresh sounding, we're lucky to have them still around..enjoy it!
B002NXSRW0|5.0|I thought this was a great movie with lots of special effects, action, suspense, and comedy! I have never owned a G.I. Joe action figure, or seen the cartoon, so that's why I liked it for what it was. When the U.S. Army is delivering a nanotechnology-based weapon to NATO, Duke Hauser and Ripcord's team are attacked by a group called Cobra. They want to join General Hawk's G.I. Joe Team. Duke knows The Baroness, because they were going to get married years earlier. When Duke is kidnapped and brought to Cobra's lair, the group must stop Cobra from releasing the weapon that would bring the world to its knees, and save Duke while trying to make it out alive. I highly recommend G.I. JOE: THE RISE OF COBRA!!!
B00267N3DQ|5.0|I was excited to see if Snow White was as great as I remembered as a child, and WOW were we impressed with this DVD set.  The packaging is sturdy, colorful, and engaging.  Inside there are several brochures as well as a colorful and easy to follow DVD guide.  As for the movie, the color is gorgeous and the HD sound is crisp and clear.  The whole family enjoyed this classic tale.  Just the movie and its quality would be enough to get me to purchase this DVD--however, it is loaded with bonus features that kept us busy for hours!  The Karaoke Sing-a-Long and \\"Which Princess are You?\\" quiz were favorites.  There are so many fun games, backstage peeks, and more...your family will love it!  I also love the fact they Disney packaged this edition with Blu-Ray AND a DVD.  We currently don't own a Blu-Ray player but plan to have one in the future, so this is a perfect set.  We won't have to \\"re-purchase\\" movies once we upgrade.  Disney has done it again with a magic story the whole family can enjoy!

B001FB4W0M|5.0|Ive been watching Supernatural since season 2 (I bought season 1 to catch up). What a fantastic show. The stories delve into supernatural investigation from two brothers who are part of a family heritage of hunters who hunt the supernatural. The actors who play the brothers are great and you never feel like they are acting as brothers but that they are both actually related. In this season Dean returns from being sent to Hell; he made a pact with a demon in order to save his brother. Unknowingly, this set off a chain reaction that spells the Apocalypse of the Bible and season 5 (the current season) is the End Times. I highly recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of Ghost Whisperer, X Files or Millenium.
0977476073|5.0|Why should you read any translation of Mein Kampf? Sun Tzu said you must know your enemy. We read about those we regard as dangerous, or wrong or criminal in order to avoid that type of individual ever encroaching into power again. We also read to understand that person in relationship to the times in which he lived.<br /><br />Just as Hitler knew his dreaded enemy, the Communist Party and Karl Marx, we should know Hitler, the Fascist dictator. Hitler didn't take on an issue or an enemy without knowing it inside-out. In that regard, he was brilliant. He knew what he was fighting. He knew the enemy.<br /><br />Elite Minds, of which Ford is president, has produced a highly marketable product and do a keen job of marketing. The physical book is well made, on good paper and the hard cover makes it something that will last a long time.<br /><br />The book has some typos. And, there are also a few things in the method of translation I'm not sure about. For example, Ford says bourgeois is not the middle class, as all the accepted definitions of the word tell us it means, but that Hitler meant the class above middle class. Marx meant the bourgeois as anyone employing others or owning property - he included the middle class.<br /><br />Ford, however, puts the middle class into the proletariat and I am not convinced that's what Hitler meant as Hitler knew Marx' philosophy well and referred to it often.<br /><br />The book is an easy read, which is why I suspect it has so many positive reviews. People like an easy read. It's Americanized. So now there's no excuse for anyone not reading this classic.<br /><br />Ford explains who unknown people and events are to whom Hitler refers. This greatly helps the reader understand what he's reading and how it relates to the whole.<br /><br />The word Putsch, which few Americans would understand, is left in and unexplained, however.<br /><br />Another word that he gives an unusual definition of is Weltanschauung. The word literally means philosophy of life. Ford, however, translates it to mean, among other things, ideals.<br /><br />In reading Mein Kamph, philosophy of life seems to fit better to me. It also means ideology. Yet, we must consider the context in which Hitler wrote the book and the audience for whom it was written.<br /><br />I'm not sure it was necessary to change \\"the war\\" into \\"the second world war\\" when the reader should know which war Hitler was referring to -- we know what period of history we're reading. Nonetheless, it makes that point clear.<br /><br />Contrary to the marketing material for the book, there is a good, English audio version of Mein Kampf [...]<br /><br />The James has been in constant use by English-speaking NS since 1939. Some say it's the most authoritative translation. I'm not sure I agree.<br /><br />Ford says Murphy often took a passage and rewrote it in his own words. As a writer, I find I have to do the same thing, however. I see no alternative when translating. When a client gives me some gawd-awful thing he's written, I have to take it word for word, line-by-line and put it in words the reader can quickly grasp -- my own words. A translator must do the same, while at the same time saying what the subject intended to say, how he said it -- whether with humor, hate or whatever.<br /><br />I expect most people who are interested in buying this book already know the book well. But there are, I suspect, others who have no knowledge of the book. So to those people, I'll direct a few comments.<br /><br />Mein Kampf is an interesting look into the mind of Adolf Hitler and it is intriguing how we can see some of the same character traits and even actions in numerous people in public office today. If we don't know history, we're apt to repeat it.<br /><br />Why did people follow Hitler? Knowing what we do now, it's easy to think the German people were stupid. The truth is the country had suffered a severe punishing war and hyperinflation -- money was worthless. They needed a real leader.<br /><br />Hitler promised everyone everything. He was just the \\"right\\" person for that particular time. If times had been different, he would not have risen to power in all likelihood.<br /><br />I find Hitler part genius, part psychopath. I recommend you read the great writer/historian John Toland's book, [[ASIN:0385420536 Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography]] The book is dynamite and sheds a new light on Hitler.<br /><br />Reading Mein Kampf will not make you a Fascist or Anti-Semite. That's ludicrous! But only the stupid person reads what he already believes, listens to only those with whom he agrees. The intelligent person exposes himself to all types of thought so he can form intelligent opinions for himself. Moreover, how can we dare to condemn something we've not read? How can we condemn anything about which we know nothing?<br /><br />The book -- no matter what translation -- is a must-read. It's a classic. It's a book that gives you insight into one of the most important minds of the 20th Century and in all of history.<br /><br />This translation brings life and excitement into the words, thoughts and actions of Hitler. Remember, Hitler was not a writer. He was a speaker. And he \\"wrote\\" Mein Kampf while pacing and dictating to Hess. We do not write as we speak. Speaking tends to be one big run-on. Ford has made the book a pleasure to read.<br /><br />You won't need a German dictionary in one hand to read this. I had to use several dictionaries to read previous versions. Fortunately, I have many dictionaries of various languages on my Palm. But, it's quite nice to be able to read Mein Kampf without the aid of a dictionary or encyclopedia.<br /><br />Having said that, I encourage you to read all translations of the book if you have a keen interest in it. The German language is lovely and the beauty of reading it is unsurpassed. You feel a closeness to the subject and the people to whom he spoke.<br /><br />Reading Mein Kampf gave me a deep empathy for the German people of that period. I could see how they could be taken in by this horrid man. Indeed, I can see how it could happen again -- today.<br /><br />Note: I'm getting the audio version soon and will update this review with a commentary on it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this translation to you. I must, however, add a few comments to balance what I've said and in the interest of fairness.<br /><br />On linkedin, Ford says he's in the \\"computer software industry.\\" He also seems to be a power seller on ebay and has written quite a bit about winning on ebay, selling on ebay, etc. I find nothing to indicate he is a scholar or expert on Nazi Germany or Hitler. That doesn't mean he is not. It only means I've found no evidence of it.<br /><br />I'm not sure how he is qualified to translate Mein Kampf and claim to have the only \\"real\\" edition. Mein Kampf is in the public domain and, as such, anyone can translate it, repackage it and sell it.<br /><br />If you'll read the sales pitch Elite Minds has on its site, on Amazon and all of its marketing material, they use the worn out, Internet marketers call to action of \\". . . grab\\" . .. your Special Edition of this Hardback Book now. When I read those words, I almost didn't buy the book. They're scare-away words. Sort of scream the wrong message when the word \\"grab\\" is inserted into a call to action.<br /><br />Finally, the reader should be aware of the fact that Ford wrote the \\"Mein Kampf Translation Controversy\\", which naturally leads to the conclusion that only one translation is correct --- The Ford Translation.<br /><br />So there you have both sides of the issue. Even in light of the negatives I've outlined here, I recommend the book for the reasons I've given. It's a good read.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I received the audio version of The Ford Translation. I'm quite impressed with everything about it. It is, without a doubt, one of the most handsome and complete audio packages of any work I've seen in my long history of listening to audio books.<br /><br />The two mp3 CDs are extraordinarily well presented and give the reader a complete body of work. When you've listened to the entire thing, including Mein Kampf and the beautiful music, speeches and other bonuses, look at Hitler's newspaper, you'll get a real feel for the period during which Hitler espoused his thoughts and committed his horrendous deeds upon humanity.<br /><br />I highly recommend the audio version to you either in place of the hard back book or, preferably, to supplement it.<br /><br />I also want to update my original review. After more careful study, I've determined that Ford has done an exceptional job of translating and providing the public with a tremendously engaging and useful edition of Mein Kampf.<br /><br />He has given more attention to detail than any previous translator. He has taken into consideration how Hitler talked and his style. He has not just taken a German dictionary and translated words -- which would have been totally improper but which previously had been done.<br /><br />While I won't go so far as to say there may not be errors in this translation, I will say that I find it most agreeable. It's easy to read and understand and it makes previous translations look quite pale in comparison.<br /><br />As I stated before, I'm not sure what Ford's qualifications are. But he has done an inordinate amount of work on this translation and, as far as I can see, the translation exceeds the standards of any previous version.<br /><br />There are a few terms I'm not totally sure of -- terms or words that read differently in all the translations. But quite frankly, if one can think for oneself, one can select the way he chooses to personally translate any given word or phrase.<br /><br />I'm sure that Hitler scholars will dissect the book and evaluate it based on their unique knowledge. But for now, I think we are fortunate to have this translation and the accompanying material from which to draw our own opinions of Hitler and his astounding rise to power and subsequent misuse of it.<br /><br />- Susanna K.

097747609X|5.0|While not an easy read, I rather enjoy this translation and find it quite useful. The good news is -- once you get into it, you find it's not all that difficult to read. You begin to understand the message and the translation.<br /><br />James Murphy started the translation. Ford, president of Elite Minds, publisher of the book, says Murphy embellished it, left things out, added things, and used academic words that make it hard to read.<br /><br />He says he has not changed any wording and he has left all mistakes as they were. He adds, and probably correctly, that much was lost in the translation and that it sounded more like Murphy and less like Hitler. Murphy wrote for the intellectual while Hitler spoke to the working class.<br /><br />Little needs to be said about the words of Hitler. I enjoy reading Mein Kampf. That certainly is not an endorsement of the man or his movement. Mein Kampf is an interesting look into the mind of this man and it is interesting how we can see some of the same characteristics running in numerous people in office today. If we don't know history, we're apt to repeat it.<br /><br />Indeed, Hitler might even have won a Nobel Peace Prize based on his promises and the excitement he created in people before they really got to know him had the prize been given in those days! Certainly such greats as JFK and Churchill gave him glowing compliments.<br /><br />Why did people follow Hitler? Knowing what we do now, it's easy to think the German people were stupid.

B0027WNRIG|4.0|This album kickstarted Def Leppard's commercial success in the US and rightfully so. \\"Foolin'\\" \\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Photograph\\" (an original MTV staple from the age) remain popular songs at Def Leppard concerts to this day. Having just seen Def Leppard in concert this past summer, it was especially interesting to hear the bonus tracks (a more or less complete concert from the Pyromania tour in 1983) and appreciate the comparison. The audio quality of the show is excellent, and the band is still young and lean. An excellent example of the genre and of the band itself.
0786868724|5.0|Have A Little Faith makes me think about the importance of faith in my life.  I don't read the Bible on a regular basis, but the Bible verses and quotes in this book are very thoughtful.  Everyone has the ability to help other people and influence lives, no matter what faith they believe in.  This is the most important thing I learned from reading this book.  Another important lesson in this book is to live life to the fullest and to appreciate everything in life.<br /><br />Albom profiles two men in this book who have influenced so many lives.  One of them is a Jewish rabbi and the other is a Christian pastor.  Their lives take very paths.  In the beginning of the book Albom switches between the stories of the two men in the beginning, but the common thread between them is faith.  It is interesting to read how Albom's life changes because of these two men.  I truly believe that faith can change lives after reading this book.

0634049011|5.0|This book is 22 chapters. It starts with very basic single string study and quickly gets into scales, chords and arpeggios. It categorizes most every combination. The fun part is that you are filling in the dots in the diagram. It feels like solving crosswords. There is minimal writing by the author which is good. It is mostly work out on your part. The correct answers are printed in the index. The last exercise is basically review of everything. It took me over two years to finish this thin book. I gave it five star because I liked this workbook a lot and learned too much from it so gave two extra copies to my buddies. I am now keeping it as a reference book.
0312360258|1.0|This book should give anyone hope that they can get their work published and mass distributed.   Poorly written and I stress poorly.  This book sounds like an adult trying to sound like a teen.  The main character is annoying, overly self reflective, and lives in a simile.   Opinionated and regrettably not an opinion of value.  This book angers me to the point where I want my money back.  If you're on the fence, DON'T DO IT.       If you're looking for a great book to read, I suggest The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.

I stumbled across this book and found the topic to be quite interesting especially chapters 1-3 that focus on facts about being an HSP and general heatth and lifestyle issues. Once I got to chapter four (p66 out of 232) I got bored and felt like the content repeated itself a lot from what had already been explained very well in the first couple of chapters. The chapters on work and soul/spirit are also interesting. I personally like to read books with vibrant active verbs and not so passive so I guess that's why I lost interest. 4 stars for the first three chapters and work and spirit but the rest of it wasn't written in enough of a dynamic way to keep me interested.

Oh, yea the BOX looks pretty cool...<br /><br />I'm not going to waste your time with some diatribe about what IS included... what ISN'T included... the running order... the empty slot in the box or ANY of that rot.<br />You can read a track listing without any help.  I'm sure there are lots of websites which have one by now.  Here's what a track list won't tell you.<br /><br />THANK THE EVER-PRECIOUS ALMIGHTY I NEVER SOLD MY 'DEFINITIVE EDITION' REMASTERS!<br />They will continue to get the same workload they always have.  I could NOT force myself through a single piece on ANY of the 5.1 DVDs.  I have never heard anything so miserably HARSH and BRITTLE and downright irritating to listen to, even at barely audible volumes.  Trimming the treble 2, or even 4 dB helped very little, and after I had tried everything I knew including turning the system down to virtual silence, I gave up.  What sounds (to me) like Total Treble Distortion kills all possible enjoyment I had worked myself up to expect from this release.  IMHO the DVDs are a complete and utter failure.<br /><br />The CDs?  Well both _Three Sides Live_ & _The Way We Walk_ are pretty fair... far from the best live CDs I've ever heard but at least they're not harsh, grating and irritating beyond any toleration.  Sadly however, the _Genesis Live_ and _Live @ the Rainbow_ CDs pretty much match the 5.1s for sheer ability to ride my last nerve raw... while the _Seconds Out_ CDs, which force you to listen to the first note of track 2 twice, are a little smoother and I can get through them at almost normal volume with the treble trimmed \\"just\\" 2 dB.<br /><br />These performances WOULD be fantastic, if only I could actually listen to them.  There must be some misunderstanding, 'cause there sure is some kind of mistake.<br />-Ole Troll

1594202249|2.0|Not *that* smart. Not that captivating. Dialogue seems really contrived. SoCal surf-culture anthropology is interesting; however, I am not sure he masters \\"surfer\\" or \\"stoner\\" talk for that matter.  I wanted, I really wanted this book to be good. This is not \\"light\\" Pynchon.  This is not-that-good Pynchon. :(.
B0021L8US0|5.0|\\"District 9\\" is a sci-fi movie by description but far more than that.  A word of caution - the R rating is fully deserved - this film is extremely brutal both in graphic images as it is in emotional concepts.  It seems that the only thing that makes it possible to actually show what it shows - i.e. persons pulverized to bloody mush - is the fact that good half of those persons are aliens - and not very likable aliens at that.  They are not really threatening - they are mostly mean, ugly, prone to mindless vandalism degenerates of a race fallen to an unknown calamity.   The movie starts as a fake documentary of sorts - summarizing the alliens' arrival some 20 years ago, subsequent discovery that the visitors are really a pathetic group of physically exhausted and mentally incapacitated survivors huddling on a disabled ship, goverment's efforts to house them on Earth in what quickly becomes a ghetto town, increasing civic hostility toward the uninvited visitors, and the subsequent action to move them all into a new facility - a tent city in the middle of nowhere surrounded by barbed wire.  Enter the main protagonist - dorky  bureaucrat put in charge of this operation.  He is as clueless as he is terrifying - shyly showing the wedding picture of his wife for the camera (\\"my angel\\"), and then cheerfully providing a running commentary as shacks containg ready to hatch alien younglings are being incinerated with flame torches by the special forces (the eggs popping from heat sound a lot like popcorn, he says....).  All this is frequently punctuated by testimonials and comments from experts - and provides a very scary view of how media can put an acceptable spin on just about anything in the name of science and reason.  Of course, things do not go as planned - the main character gets inadvertently exposed (mostly due to his rigid assumption of superiority over anything alien) to alien DNA, and starts to evolve into, yes you guessed it - an alien.  Humans betray him, as they all want to kill him and dissect his organs to advance military and medical science.  He is forced to make a leap of faith and turn to the very aliens he abused for a chance of an unlikely alliance.  A lot of very gory scenes, shootings and suspense ensues... See it for yourselves - I will not give out the ending.  The movie is good and chilling to the bone not because of ugly aliens or intergalactic conflict.  Most critics drew parallels with South African apperheid (the ship happens to crush land over Johannesburg) but I think that there is much more to it.  It shows how so many things were made possible:  Hitler, the slave ships, gulags and extermination of half of Asia and Eastern Europe by Stalin, concentration camps, the gradual destruction of Native Americans, what the Conquistadors did to the native peoples of South America, and what Ceasar did to Gallic and German tribes... It shows how easily, when it comes to those different, fear and prejudice can eclipse the need to understand and connect.  How there are people eager to play officials with guns - not for a cause but for the pleasure of seeing those different suffer and die.  How many average people will resort to bestiality to assert their \\"normality\\".  Watch it at your own risk - it is not pleasant to view but truly extraordinary...

0321344758|4.0|After seeing the title I just had to read this book. I use this philosophy for just about everything - the easy, repetitive stuff should be so easy you do not have to think about it  while freeing up our brain power for life's challenges and the fun stuff. So it goes with good design and usability. That is the essence of this book, basic web design practices which will provide the user with a pleasant experience when visiting your website.<br /><br />Here are what I consider the highlights of this book:<br /><br />1. Usability - The author preaches good usability and this shines through in this book. The book is easy to read, has nice diagrams, and simple explanations and examples.<br />2. Short - This book is short and to the point while providing a good overview of usability. The goal of the author was to write the book so a potential reader could finish within a long plane flight. After reading this book I consider myself much better versed in usability than prior to with minimal investment of time.<br />3. Examples - There are some pretty solid examples here. One particularly memorable example was in the form of screen captures of what the Web designer designs and what the Web user sees. Point taken.<br />4. Recommended Reading - The author provides some good recommendations in the form of books and websites. A good explanation is provided as to why each item is recommended.<br /><br />Here are what I consider the drawbacks of this book:<br /><br />1. Design Recommendations: This is a very subjective (and therefore heated) topic for many. Although there is some solid advice on basic design to ease the user experience I found some of the recommendations (and examples) to be a bit utilitarian for my liking. Fun design and ease of use is a tricky balancing act - so this is not necessarily a hit against the book but rather a note of difference in style. This is not a flashy design book, but more functional in nature.<br />2. Humor: This is another subjective area. Although I prefer humorous treatment of otherwise potentially boring topics (Seth Godin is one of my favorite authors in the field of Marketing) I found the humor to be a bit dated and did not really appeal to me. This should not stop someone from purchasing the book, but worth noting nonetheless.<br /><br />Overall I found this book to be a good overview of the subject of website usability by a credible source. Given the short amount of time it will take to read the book, I believe it is worthwhile for those who create websites, are involved in the marketing function in a company who has a website, or an individual who is interested in learning about usability.ise potentially boring topics (Seth Godin is one of my favorite authors in the field of Marketing) I found the humor to be a bit dated and did not really appeal to me.

0385504225|4.0|For a few weeks I staunchly resisted opening The Lost Symbol because I had other books claiming my attention. Two days ago I cracked it open and was immediately sucked into the world of Dan Brown, emerging bleary-eyed and contemplative. While many elements echoed The Da Vinci Code - reluctant hero, damsel in distress, fanatic villain, wise mentor, ancient secrets - they are such archetypes that Brown can be forgiven for the resonance. He really is a master storyteller who weaves history, suspense and arcana into a fairly compulsive page-turner full of adrenalin rushing action, and a labyrinth of unexpected twists and turns. The dialogue can get a bit forced on occasion, especially when presenting paragraphs of obscure factoids, and I did find myself skimming a bit.<br /><br />But this is first and foremost a thriller, and since I don't want to give away the plot, I'll focus on what might be the impact of The Lost Symbol.<br /><br />Like good art and literature generally, I think this book both reflects and will affect the collective psyche. It taps into the same profound yearnings to understand life's mysteries that rocketed The Secret to popularity a few years ago.  It dangles the notion that there are indeed answers out there that \\"they\\" (government, illuminati, the Church, anyone in power, etc.) are keeping from us - grist for the mill of our inner conspiracy theorist. His research is exhaustive and meticulous, and I noticed that there are already three \\"guides\\" to the book out there or on the way.<br /><br />The book can be read on several different levels: as a jolly good read, as pop history, as a popularized introduction to esoteric ideas, and/or as a big wake-up call. I'm not sure it will have the same impact as the Da Vinci Code, because the conclusions are more personal and require reflection.<br /><br />The ending straddles the border between magic and plausible possibility, between victimhood and the dazzling power of creation. I recall the immortal words of Pogo, \\"We have met the enemy, and they are us...\\" The Lost Symbol would suggest, \\"We have met God, and God is us...\\" Let's hope this work is a self-fulfilling prophecy.nemy, and they are us...\\" The Lost Symbol would suggest, \\"We have met God, and God is us...\\" Let's hope this work is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
B002LVVCIK|1.0|Does anyone wonder why Michael Moore chose to release his film in the USA, rather than in ANY other nation of the world???!!!  Common sense tells me that he did it because his best income market is there!!!!  As a businessman, Michael Moore loves Capitalism!!!    Consider the following:    *Why do people in capitalist countries have greater levels of income and a higher standard of living than those in socialist and communist countries?    *Why do people in capitalist countries enjoy greater protections of their human rights than those in socialist and communist countries?    *Why do people in capitalist countries enjoy greater freedom and liberty than those in socialist and communist countries?    *Why do the poor of the world try so hard to escape their countries of origin and come to the United States, even if it means entering illegally?    *Why don't the poor of the world immigrate to Cuba, Russia, or China?
B0029LHW4U|5.0|I have to admit, I was one of the skeptics thinking why is Alice in Chains going on with a new singer and keeping the name of the band the same. I then saw them perform on Jimmy Kimmel Live and was blown away. I will always miss Layne Staley, but William Duvall is an awesome addition.    Now for Black Gives Way to Blue. This cd is amazing ! After listening to it once I was Totally blown away. Jerry Cantrell once again has his finger prints all over it. He takes on a much bigger role as a singer. Even though he did a lot previously, his role is much larger here. It definitely has that Alice in Chains vibe to it. \\"Your Decision\\" is one of my favorite songs, but there are many more that are just as good. And the closing title track, \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" is haunting. Cantrell is clearly singing about his friend and former band mate Layne Staley. As much as the closing track on Dirt, \\"Would?\\", was a powerful closing song, \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" was a soft, yet touching ending to the late, great Stayley.    I highly recommend this cd to any Alice in Chains fan. It was well worth the 14 year wait for new material. And to the purists who say they are not really Alice in Chains without Staley, please give this a chance. William Duvall will not disappoint you. I am already looking forward to the next cd, I just hope it does not take another 14 years.
0385504225|1.0|I've read better Star Trek novels..true!  This is pure junk , a rip-off of the National Treasure series, and made for the movies, not reading! Don't waste your money!

B00267N3DQ|3.0|Thanks to One2One Network, I received a copy of the [[ASIN:B00267N3DQ Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (DVD/Two-Disc Blu-ray + BD Live w/DVD packaging)  [Blu-ray]]] to watch and review. This Diamond Edition Combo Pack includes 2 Blu-ray discs and a DVD. I am impressed with the exceptional picture quality and sound quality. If you did not know that Snow White was originally made in 1937 or did not already watch it when you were young, one probably would assume that it had just been made recently.  I am still amazed at what Disney accomplished with Snow White in term of technical and artistic excellence back in the 1930's. I'm personally not fond of the plot, the magic spell, the unrealistic portrayal of \\"love\\" and \\"marriage\\", and the voice of Snow White. However, my sons (10 and 8 years old) seemed to enjoy the DVD. We still laughed and had a good time. We do not have a Blu-ray player. They claim that Blu-ray discs are scratch resistant which sounds nice to me. If you are a fan of Snow White, you would love this combo pack.  For the first time ever, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is made in High Definition 7.1 Sound. From this combo pack, you will enjoy bonus features such as an all new music video, Dopey's Wild Mine Ride Game, \\"Heigh-Ho\\"Karaoke Sing-Along, will be able to play games (What Do You See?, Mirror, Mirror On the Wall, Jewel Jumble), and will get to see behind the scenes stuff of \\"The One that Started It All.\\"

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a veteran of exercise tapes going back to the old Jane Fonda tapes. I can honestly say that Jillian's tapes are the hardest I've ever worked out to not including Billy Blanks' workouts which were just nuts.    I've been using the tapes for about 3 weeks now. I've only lost about 4 lbs but that's because of my eating habits. Despite that, I have lost inches and I look leaner which pleases me and which I attribute solely to the tapes. My lost inches are in the thighs, stomach and butt.     To give you an idea of how hard Jillian works you, the trainers that work out with her are unable to keep up. Have you ever seen that happen on a tape before? I haven't. The strength and the cardio are very effective and there is no doubt that at the end of the workout, you will feel as though you have accomplished something.

0385504225|1.0|I have little more to add that wasn't already delightfully expressed in that classic review \\"I'm Pretty Sure It Went Down Like This.\\" I had the same reaction to this book I had really anticipated. It was a total botch trying to capitalize on the earlier titles.     I could not believe how tediously religious it was getting. I finally gave up in the last few pages and stopped reading.     Spare us the religious stuff, Dan; we get enough of that hypocrisy on CNN.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a wonderful movie for the entire family.

B0011N1WE8|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Due to a curse that was placed on her family in the 19th Century, an otherwise attractive British high society blueblood by the name of  Penelope Wilhern was born with pigs' ears and a snout.  This, as one would imagine, has put something of a damper on the poor girl's dating life, since prospective romantic partners invariably run screaming out of the room the moment they first lay eyes on her.  Enter Johnny, a scruffy, down-on-his-luck compulsive gambler hired by an investigative reporter to infiltrate Penelope's house to see if the rumors of a pig-nosed girl residing therein are indeed true.  But can this principled cad help falling in love with the \\"real,\\" \\"beautiful\\" Penelope who lies just beneath the surface of this grotesquely swinish exterior? (Though, if truth be told, if you`re going to be stuck going through life with a pig-nose, you could do a lot worse than the one Penelope is forced to put up with here).<br /><br />As to \\"Penelope\\" itself, it doesn't bode well for any film when most of the minor players have English accents and most of the major ones do not - especially when, without exception, everyone is ostensibly playing a British character.  Beyond that, this \\"beauty is only skin deep\\" parable hasn't been accorded the wit or imagination it would actually need to be successful.  The fairy tale ambiance has been reasonably well adapted to the modern scene, but the narrative arc that comes along with it could hardly be more transparent or predictable.<br /><br />In addition, the movie, written by Leslie Caveny and directed by Mark Palansky, is replete with overwrought slapstick scenes of people screaming, running, diving out of windows, etc. at the mere sight of Penelope's face - scenes that, quite frankly, feel as if they were lifted straight out of an episode of \\"The Munsters.\\"<br /><br />Still, an appealing cast, made up of the likes of Christina Ricci, James McAvoy, Reese Witherspoon, Peter Dinklage, Richard E. Grant, Catherine O`Hara, and Simon Woods, at least makes the movie watchable - if you`re in the mood for this sort of thing, that is.at least makes the movie watchable - if you`re in the mood for this sort of thing, that is.
1565117808|4.0|I listened to the audio CD, which until the end I hugely loved ... The ending is a serious literary error. Gratutitious, sophomoric. It wouda took GUTs for Martel to just end his fabulous story when Pi beaches on Mexico's shore, wrap up his relocation to Canada, and just humbly GO AWAY. But Martel. IMO, indulged. He meddled. Coudn't leave well enuf alone. The Japanses guys are a silly ploy, and the alternate story Pi offers them, IMO, was material that came from an earlier draft--material Martel just coudn't let go of--and perhaps began the earlier draft, all aboard the lifeboat dying--\\"And I alone survived\\", a la Job--and then the adventures of the lone survivor begin. Tacking all this nonsense on at the end makes a anticlimatic point, if at all, and BREAKS THE SPELL SO WONDEFULLY SPUN! It's okay, Yann, to just tell an inspired story and just get OUT OF THE WAY!
032147404X|5.0|I bought a DSLR camera to take better pictures of both family and my son's sporting events, which I succeeded at.  Then, I wanted to \\"step things up\\" and take even better photos so bought this book based on amazon reviews.  If you are pretty new to DSLR's and want to know more, this is the book for you.  The advice and hints in the book are brief and to the point; Kelby does not go into massive detail that only the serious professional can understand, but takes his teaching down to the amateur level so even the newest DSLR owners can majorly improve their photo-taking.    I want to add that I also purchased books 2 and 3 recently and even though a few of the points in the books are repetitive, by combining all the great things I have learned in all three books, I feel I am now on my way to being a serious photographer instead of a wanna-be.  I now know what ISO to use when, what mm to shoot at for what, what modes to use and why, how to use my flash correctly in all types of lighting, how F-stops work and why, etc, and can do so on the fly to take the best shot possible.  Thanks Scott Kelby for a great set of books!
0679735909|5.0|The romantic writers of the Victorian age looked back with nostalgia at the middle ages.  They fell back in love with overwrought Gothic architecture and the mythic tales of Celtic and druid tradition. They rejected the arid classical mannerisms that had come from the age of reason, the rigid society that disfavored the folk tales and fantasies of the village for pure science and observable facts. A.S. Byatt knows her subject, and she knows it like an academic. She no doubt, has read innumerable critics on the subject of Victorian authors and so she sets about making fun of them-- not Victorian writers, no-- she is laughing at the critics. She does this with lovely prose, and poetry.  She creates two characters, that I want to go back and figure out who they are modeled after Christabel LaMott, might be Christina Rossetti and who might R.F. Ash be? I haven't managed to look back in time and find him.  He certainly isn't one of the earlier romantics like Shelly, Keats or Byron.  They neither one exhibit the repressed Victorian sexuality that Ashe exhibits.   Who ever they were  modeled on,  Ashe and LaMott, Byatt creates an ingenious fictitious archive of their work and letters.  I find it all amazing the way she inhabits the age and recreates it's language. This in itself is something I haven't seen done often, and when it was attempted the results were often embarrassing. So while reading this book I am thinking A.S. Byatt is brave to make this attempt.  She is writing poems that are not her poems, she is writing poems that would be written by a Victorian Man, and they must seem to be the authentic thoughts of a real writer, and I do think she succeeds.  There are two stories in this novel, the Victorian and the modern story, that surrounds the Victorian tale.  I find it clever that Byatt turns the stories inside out. So often when there is a modern telling of an older story the older story is mythologized.  Who would think to mythologize the modern story, but thisis what Byatt decides to do.  She creates devilish characters that intend to rape England of it's treasures.  The characters evolve into the icons of all romances, where good triumphs over evil. I admit, I took my time reading this book, it isn't a page turner, but few good books are anymore.  Maybe its because I'm too old to fall for those old fables. Sometimes I think of music or art when I read a book, and I think if this were art, it would be figurative art.  Joyce's Ulysses would be abstract, or perhaps something of Charlie Parkers work. A.S Byatt isn't trying to do that to us.  She is writing an old fashioned story in an old fashioned narrative form, but she does it perfectly with a back twist added to the end, and she lands it sturdily.
0385504225|4.0|After reading Angels & Demons, I was hooked to Dan Brown...Then followed the the Da Vinci Code, and finally The Lost Symbol...As to where Dan Brown draws everything out over long processes, his detail to actual fact amazes me. I think the reason I like to read his books so much is because I learn a lot of the ACTUAL history, while reading his suspenseful tale. Was VERY pleased with this one, just as the others!
0385504225|2.0|So great were the media inspired expectations for this novel that anything Dan Brown produced without direct divine intervention could not have met them.  Nevertheless, his latest work disappoints at an unprecedented level.<br /><br />Certainly, there is enough puerile symbology, pseudo reasoning, action and plot twists to keep the reader occupied, though some genuinely extraneous and tedious passages dramatically slow the pace.  (Perhaps the publisher based the price of the book on weight.)  But readers offended by the indefinite conclusion of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" will be even more incensed by the ending here.  Not wanting to reveal too much to those still motivated to read the book, I will say only that this symbol driven chase yields nothing beyond a tiresome and ridiculously unsatisfying d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />Dan Brown and his publishers have clearly discovered another important symbol - the sign of the almighty dollar.
0385504225|5.0|I have to admit that going in to this book I was anticipating a letdown given the success of the DaVinci Code and the amount of time that it took for Dan Brown to come out with a follow-up.  However, I was far from disappointed.  This book was even better than the DaVinci Code and was tough to put down.  There were unexpected twists and enough historical reference to keep things intriguing.  If you liked or loved the DaVinci Code, you will love this book.  If you weren't a fan then I would pass as it is similar in style to that book.  I hope it doesn't take as long for another Dan Brown book.
B001SGEUNI|2.0|The vocals are pleasing enough, but the lyrics are utterly tired and cliched.

B0029LHW4U|5.0|Thank you, Jerry, Sean, Mike and William for this amazing collection of songs.  Whoever thought the day would come when we could buy a brand new cd from Alice in Chains?!?!?!?!?! The collection of works on this album shows why Cantrell is one the landmark guitarists/singer/songwriters of our generation.  It is solid from beginning to end and just keeps getting better with every listen.    The album seems to me to be a tremendous evolution of the group.  William is a great fit and its great to see them having fun.  I saw them 2 years ago at Eagle's Ballroom in Milwaukee.  The concert was a progression of the band from their early songs thru 1996 and included an awesome acoustical set during the middle 1/3 of the show.  There also seemed to be the presence of LS on stage with them that night coming out in Duvall's voice.  Seeing that show really helps me appreciate this cd even more.  Thank you again.
B002Q63JEU|4.0|Got it when it was a few bucks because I had heard a few Paramore songs before and I liked the sound.  Hayley is a great singer.  I don't think anyone can deny that they write some catchy melodies.  This is a nice CD with pretty much no filler.  The only song I don't like as much as the rest is \\"Feeling Sorry\\" because the chorus just doesn't work for me.  The rest is all solid though.  The couple of slower acoustically driven songs are a welcome break between the uptempo songs.  Worth the money if you're a fan of the band.
0385504225|1.0|6 years of waiting for a new book and we get this???     Aside from the fact that this is a weak copy of Dan Brown's two previews books (skeptical professor - check, mysterious man - check, distressed female character - check), the quality of writing is that of a grade school student. While I don't mind the 'scientific' explanations Dan Brown puts in his books and I enjoy finding which facts are real and which invented, I can't stand constant ramblings of his characters, repeated over and over again.     You can find interesting stories written by fan fiction writers and I am so glad I got the books at a library and didn't spend a penny on it.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|On one hand I can see why people are praising this CD so much.  It's got some mind blowing solo's from Mark Tremonti.  Myles Kennedy sings some brilliant melodies.  But on the other hand it isn't as amazing as everyone is saying.  One of the flaws of Blackbird are that so many of the songs are so similar.  They rarely switch up their song structures which is slightly disappointing because you know they are capable.  One song that does change things up is the title track, Blackbird.  That is one epic song at 8 minutes.  Everyone should hear it.  The chorus is awesome, the verses are great, and it all leads up to such a kicking guitar solo.  The whole album is worth it just for that but it's full of good songs, some great.  There isn't a bad song on here but the problem is, like I said before, that you will be listening to it and think, \\"Didn't I just hear this song?\\".  Still though, I'd definitely recommend it just don't expect it to be anything too exceptionally original.

B001JEDR6U|5.0|In my opinion, William Strunk is THE authority on the rules of writing.  And E.B. White, author of Charlotte's Web, was Professor Strunk's pupil at Cornell.  This book, which is not even 80 pages long, has stood the test of time.  I believe it should be required reading in high school English class.  If nothing else, everyone should put into practice his rule #13: Omit Needless Words.  (I am reviewing the 2nd edition by Strunk and White published by Macmillan Publishers.)  Another good book on writing is \\"The Writing System for Scientists and Engineers\\" by Edmond Weiss.

B00007LTIC|4.0|1977 was surely one of the most involved years in terms of prog rock. The sound itself was far from unique anymore as any number of bands were making a killing on the charts with the style. After a little while away from the studio after their early/mid 70's heyday Yes re-emmerged with this album that pretty much found them running strong on all cylinders. Everything is intact that made Yes unique,most obviously the keyboard and synthesizer wizardry of Rick Wakeman which is prominant throghout this album.One thing I need to say about this album and some prog rock in general is that while the musical ideas on this album are broad,profound and often otherworldly many of them are joined together into long compositions such \\"Awaken\\". Even the title track which has a very heavy blues based guitar riff leading into it seems like two conjoined tunes rather than something fully conseived in and of itself even though it,like the other tunes here are only five or seven minutes or so. It's an excellent symphonic rock album but it,as with much of it's genre is very involved musically and needs to be listened to very closely to fully absorb it. Perhaps the lack of casual musical excellence as opposed to profound musical excellence is one of the reasons I don't review much prog rock because it's always just a little too much to explain. And this is so orgasmic and overwelming that on occasion you might get so lost in the alternating rhythmic and harmonic concepts rather than be able to follow them,as you do with for example most kinds of jazz and such. Still it's one of Yes's good albums for sure and the songwriting is incredible.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|I really like the stability that these have added to my ps3 controller. They are also very easy to remove and install; so if you don't like them you haven't permanently ruined anything.    Only downside I have noticed is the plastic was not filled so its edges can be a little sharp out of the package not sharp enough to cut you but but definitely uncomfortable. I also am a large person and use my index fingers for R1 and R2, I can foresee a problem for people who use their middle fingers for R2 because pinching could definitely occur.    Bottom line I put them on my controller and I will NOT be taking them off anytime soon.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I cannot stop jamming to this album since I received from the iTunes pre-order last night. I am fervent BSB lover, but not to the point where I can't hear a little bit of criticism.     I agree in both senses that the Boys have made a huge leap into the 21st century with this album and have in a lot of ways failed.     I, however, love that because they are most definitely a 90's group. They've managed to take big steps towards not being left behind by this new age of music, but at the same time I hear so much of who they are. Their are ENTERTAINERS with crazy fun spirit. I can see them doing their cute little dance moves to all the upbeat songs in this album.     They sound a little more electronic in this album, but they have also managed to not be buried by that. Their vocals are still amazing.     I don't have a lot of time, but in short I wanted to say that this album is just another step of development the Boys have shown. Notice how all their albums are so different from each other, they're a group truly open to change and improvement, as well as holding firm in what they stand for (the last standing 90's boy band!)    My Personal FAVS off the album: \\"Bigger\\", \\"Straight Through My Heart\\", \\"All of Your Life (You Need Love)\\", \\"If I Knew Then\\", \\"This is Us\\", \\"Shattered\\", \\"Helpless\\".     I just don't really like \\"PDA\\". Kind of a stupid song, but that's the only one I don't like.     Buy it, enjoy it. Keep the Backstreet Pride ALIVE and stop hating. It bugs the crap out of me because people are so quick to judge the boys. Where is the love and respect?

B00006G8G1|4.0|Iron Maiden always seem to deliver live, that does happen in this dvd.  The only negative aspect would have to be the production, with regards to the ever changing camera angles, at times it can get annoying, as has been pointed out in other reviews.  However, I found it reasonably watchable with only the odd occassion that got on my nerves.  Musically Iron Maiden is sounding as good, if not better than earlier efforts.  If you are wanting a full greatest hits package the Live After Death and Flight 666 dvds are excellent additions. Rock In Rio is a good dvd that first introduced the current lineup. Its good to see these legends still going strong after all these years.

B00003CXC6|3.0|In a brief introduction to this edition, Robert Altman talks about how 'Rashomon' influenced him as a director - how the day after watching he incorporated into his own work camera angles he'd first seen the day before.  From the perspective of a film buff, even from a casual one, this is instructive and educational.  Others who aren't concerned about film techniques and storytelling methods may wonder what all the fuss is about.      Part of the problem when dealing with groundbreaking films like 'Rashomon', and which is unavoidable, is that other filmmakers, like Altman, are going to pilfer from the original until it's as common as its imitations.  Without clues, as a modern viewer, I already have trouble picking out exactly what it was that made the first film so unique, though when it's pointed out, as in commentaries, I do find it noteworthy.  Not necessarily compelling though - and not the primary reason I have for watching a film.      As an average member of the audience, it's the story in which I'm interested.  In fact, absorbing stories and different outlooks are why I seek out foreign films in the first place - I'm looking for a distinct perspective on the human condition.  The way that it is told - the art of direction and editing - plays an important part in the effective transmission of that story from director to audience, and may even add depth to the story, but particular techniques tend to lose their surprising originality over time, especially in the case of pioneering, often copied directors like Kurosawa.  So the question is, does 'Rashomon' still tell a compelling story after the once startling imagary is old hat?    It begins in a torrential downpour.  Two men, a priest and a woodcutter, have taken refuge in the ruins of an abandoned gatehouse and are joined by a third, a boorish ruffian.  He notices the others are under a horrible mental strain, and badgers them until they tell of the trial they had recently witnessed, and of four eyewitnessaccounts of a murder and a rape.  Each participant's account is un-reconcilable with the other, until it is unclear if anyone is telling the truth.       While the on-screen events of the film may have been somewhat daring for 1950's America, the idea that people will twist their stories around to suit their own temperament and needs could hardly have been astonishing.  Maybe my own cynicism gets in the way, but that the lies of the trial's participants would affect the priest and the woodcutter down to their existential core seems unlikely and contrived.     'Rashomon' is a critical favorite - it won the Oscar in 1951 for Best Foreign Language film, is in the top ten of director's favorites, and currently enjoys clear popularity in the film community as evidenced by its ranking on IMDB.  Those factors, and the idea that the film dealt with the slippery notion of truth, led me to expect a truly engaging and thought-provoking film.  By no means is 'Rashomon' a bad movie, but have to say I was under-whelmed.  Of Kurosawa's films, I would handily recommend 'Throne of Blood' over 'Rashomon' for an intense movie experience - and even though it's a different type of movie, I'd say that 'Seven Samurai' is also a better choice.       I'm glad that such films as 'Rashomon' are still prized and in print - I enjoy seeing how the medium has evolved and learning about film in general.  But it would be unfair to recommend unreservedly 'Rashomon' to those who are not likely to appreciate it for what it is - a good film with pioneering camera and storytelling techniques that will probably seem ho-hum by today's standard.   Budding auteurs and film buffs will find much to value - those looking solely for morally and mentally challenging content will likely be disappointed.
B000002KNY|1.0|1 Star am I crazy??? made you look. forget this and buy the dual disk- the 5.1 is the best ive heard. All the T.H. 5.1 are great-but this one is absolutly electric (guitair). I listened to this a week before I got the dual disk and decieded to give the 5.1 a try, I was laying on the couch grooving on how great the songs sounded-all the stuff I never heard in listening to it since it first came out on vynil when electric guitair came on - I just about jumped off the couch- it totally blew me away- the sound WAS electric- on drugs you can hear david take in his breath before he utters his crazy stuff, throut the album the nuances of DAvids voice is really brought forth- not that the vocals are out of place- but you can hear them crystal clear, In fact on some songs  you can hear lines that I never heard before. If you even like this cd you owe it to yourself to here it in 5.1- going back to this version would be like going back to an analog B&W T.V. this was one of my favorite album/cds- now the 5.1 version is my favorite.

1607060825|5.0|[[VIDEOID:38608351]]Apes and Babes should be the first art book of Frank Cho feature more of his action and superhero comic art. It's a 144-page hardcover with a dust jacket.<br /><br />The book features comic covers he has drawn for Marvel, Jungle Girl, Liberty Meadows and Mars. I'm not sure what Mars is but it's something like Conan, Xena, Frank Frazetta kind of art. For many of the illustrations, he has included the pencil line art version so you can see the before and after. Even though the subject is similar, the feel of the art is very different when colours are added on.<br /><br />The most impressive part about is art book is probably his knowledge of anatomy. Even though the characters might still be a bit stylised, the anatomy adds a more realistic dimensionality to the character designs. I like the way he uses extremely thin lines to portray muscle contours. The colouring -- in this case probably called lighting -- is fantastic.<br /><br />This book is recommended to superhero art collectors and Frank Cho fans.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)

0385504225|2.0|The book was a good effort - but came off as being more contrived by making Masonic ties as hypersensitive.  Perhaps the bar was set too high with his previous books.  Still enjoyed the weaving of history with the story line.
1590200918|3.0|The classic horror story images are here. Educated aristocratic narrators, a castle, a cold and boring dinner with an elderly heir along with the elements of aristocratic life: servants, Cambridge University, art appreciation and travel to Italy.<br /><br />I generally feel that a lot of contemporary fiction would improve through a tighter text. It's unusual for me to say this, but here is one of the few works that could improve with a more expansive text.<br /><br />The author has a good plot, but we really don't know the characters.  They feel dread, fear and emotionally cringe at malevolent eyes, but the text doesn't have the reader feel what they feel. To empathize with the characters, you have to know them better.  To do this the reader needs more introduction, more description... more text.<br /><br />A re-write with more character development would certainly improve the plot.
0143038419|4.0|I thought Eat Pray Love was a beautiful story of one woman's courage to discover her soul's purpose. It was both comforting and exciting to read, however, the downside to it was that many women can not imagine that the fairytale outcome of Elizabeth Gilbert's life could ever happen to them. The spiritual journey is frought with heart ache and pain usually, as it takes years of counseling, and spiritual practice to heal old habits and to discover who you truly are as a spiritual being. Consider the following read as one that you will connect with if it has taken you years of work to Heal Your Life.

B000002OX7|5.0|This review is for people like me who know almost nothing about rock music.    I definitely enjoyed listening to this album. Not like those flimsy pop albums these days that come with 1 or 2 good songs, with the rest being boring filler. Favorites:    2 Bargain: The drumming alone on this song makes it stand out. The lyrics are pretty good too. My favorite song on the entire album. Has I very nice, but brief instrumental part near the middle.    4 My Wife: I really love the rhythm and pace of this song.    8 Behind blue eyes: A classic song that I recognized from a more recent incarnation. This version is better in my opinion. The upbeat part near the end is very good; I find myself singing it throughout the day.    9 Won't get fooled again: You might recognize parts of this song from the theme for CSI:Miami. It's quite long, but it has very strong lyrics, and some very nice instrumentals mixed in. Worth every second.    The ones I just like: This Song is Over, Getting in Tune, Going Mobile and Baba O'Riley.

B0000AC8LR|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of those movies that is impossible to classify. It is not for everyone that is for sure. But if you are a fan of film you will enjoy it. My advice if you have not seen the film is to see it. My review can not do it justice and it is hard to describle. It bears repeat viewing and will really cause you to think unlike so many generic cookie cutter movies out now.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I love that Steven Spielberg made this Stanley Kubrick movie.  It's wonderfully emotional when you get down to the basic story of a child's need for the love of his mother to feel complete, regardless of his design (human or not).    What I didn't like, and what still separates Kubrick from Spielberg, was the typically repetitive way in which Spielberg always feels that he needs to explain everything to the (stupid) audience along the way.  Kubrick does not need to explain, we get it.  And if we don't, it makes for good discussion or the need to watch again.      Perfect example is how David clearly calls Monica \\"Monica\\" before reading the seven words, then calling her \\"Mommy\\" afterwards.  That's totally unnecessary.  Or the way Jigolo Joe holds his finger up for us all to see the blood coming from his customer.  Or the irrational change of attitude from Henry regarding his excitement of bringing David home to his later resentment of the \\"robot\\" when the mother takes to him (wasn't that his intention?).  Or the assumption that if a programmed robot can love, then it can hate (how?  it's programmed to love).    There are umpteen examples of this.  Steven just needs to give his audience a little more credit, and think things through a little better as to not just push the story along in a convenient manner so we can get to its conclusion.  He did add alot of Kubrick elements and true Kubrick fans will know what they are.    Overall, a great film, although you have to take interest in the subject matter to appreciate it.  I don't think the general (stupid) audiences, who just want horror and blood these days, want to take the time to appreciate what Steven has done here.
B001993Y2C|4.0|I've been a fan of this series since the beginning.  I've bought the series DVD's as they were released (except for Season 4, waiting for the Blu-rays), and I was very excited to finally get the Blu-rays.  This is a series that is shot in HD, and needs to be viewed in HD.  The color is incredible, and the action scenes/effects shots look amazing!  I was fortunate enough to watch all of Season 4 in Digital HD, but the practical effects shots (i.e. when humans are shooting guns, strobe lighting, etc) were very pixelated.  I'm thrilled to finally see the \\"clean\\" HD presentation of this series.  The writing, acting, directing and music scoring on this show are second to none, and this show has set the bar extremely high for modern sci-fi programming.  The transfers of the episodes look great, and the lengthy extras are also cool.  I've seen a lot of it on the DVD's, but some of the season 4/finale stuff was nice (I especially like the two features on scoring/recording the music for the show).  I mainly bought this for the HD episodes.  By only real complaint (and it's fairly minor) is the packaging.  I don't mind the large box, but I don't like how the discs are stored in the box.  I'm picky about the care of the discs, and I would've preferred better inserts for the discs to be stored.  But that's a minor complaint, and certainly not a deal breaker.  For any fan of the show with an HD TV and Blu-ray player, this is a must own: this series deserves to be seen in HD!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Jerry Cantrell, the real brains behind Alice in Chains, is as sharp a songwriter as ever.    1. All Secrets Known: 6/10.  This is reminiscent of \\"Get Born Again\\" and other Alice in Chains songs with some slower mysticism behind them that aren't really intended to be rocking singles.  This isn't bad, but it's more of an introduction.  2. Check My Brain: 10/10.  This is the catchiest song on the album.  I particularly love the lawnmower riff here.  This is the most obvious single, and I'm glad it is a single.  3. Last of My Kind: 7/10.  DuVall gets a chance to show off his skills on this one (as opposed to Jerry Cantrell having the lead on most of the other tracks).  This is good, and it rocks, but I feel it has some room for improvement.  4. Your Decision: 8/10.  If you liked some of the sadder fare on \\"Degradation Trip,\\" and I did, this song is for you.  The opening especially reminds me of \\"Angel Eyes,\\" another great Cantrell song.  This isn't quite as spectacular as \\"Angel Eyes,\\" but it should be a successful single.  5. A Looking in View: 6/10.  I cannot figure out why this song is a single.  It drags on too much, and it doesn't hold together too well.  That being said, there are a lot of cool ideas here, including the super heavy opening riff.  6. When the Sun Rose Again: 8/10.  I really like the flavorful choices of background on this one.  To me, it almost paints a picture of a desert and the sun rising on it.  7. Acid Bubble: 5/10.  In my opinion, this is the weakest song on the album.  Other reviewers seem to like it the best, and I can tell a lot of effort went into it, but I just don't think it holds together very well.  8. Lesson Learned: 9/10.  This is probably the second catchiest song on the album, but it takes a little longer to catch.  I would give it a perfect score if the lyrics were a little better.  9. Take Her Out: 8/10.  A lot of reviewers think this is a weak song, and while I agree that it's not as deep or memorable as others, it's still an enjoyable song, and it's perfectly tolerable for multiple listens, which you can't say of some of the other tracks on the album.  10. Private Hell: 10+/10.  This is the best song on the album, and it's the best song I've heard all year.  This combines everything I liked in both Alice in Chains and Jerry Cantrell's solo work, and it has the best lyrics.  It reminds me a lot of \\"Down in a Hole.\\"  11. Black Gives Way to Blue: 7/10. This was the only way to end the album, but like the beginning, it's not really a standout song.    Overall, this is a great album, the best new rock album I've heard all year and the most obvious choice for a Grammy.  Because Jerry Cantrell does so much of the vocals and uses strategies he tested more on his solo albums, this really sounds more like a Jerry Cantrell album than an Alice in Chains album, but I loved Jerry Cantrell's solo albums, and this definitely holds its ground with any of them or any Alice in Chains album.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|Another fantastic album from MEGADETH.  It doesn't get any better than this folks.  All the elements are here in this album.  Dave is certainly a genius.  A solid album will flow nicely from beginning to end and thats what this album does.  With an excellent intro instrumental to start it off, this album will just pull you right in like quicksand.  Be prepared  to bang your head and get a total adrenaline rush.  Everysong is written well, with amazing guitar solos, precise drumming, low-end bass, and the good old sound of dave's mysterious,dark,angry voice.  To me, this album is like a combination of RUST IN PEACE and COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION.  End Game is definitely in my top three.  Every MEGADETH fan needs to have this album.  Best metal album of 2009 no doubt.  Yes!!! It's that good!!!

B002LVVCIK|4.0|Moore has the right ideas, but he dumbs things down a little too much. And in doing so, he sometimes makes sweeping generalizations of some very complex issues.    He offers 'democracy' as an alternative to 'capitalism'. But democracy is a political term and capitalism is an economic one. They do not lie along the same spectrum.    Another example; he keeps criticising greed and the profit motive. But then what is the alternative? The real truth is that most persons act in their own self interest. That is what drives most of us and rightly so. Each person should have the freedom to protect her or his own interest first. You cannot force people to be charitable (and here I am not saying public funding for education, healthcare, social security is charity). The role of government is merely to make sure that the strong don't overwhelm the weak or are taken unfair advantage of. That is the opposite of what has been happening in the last decade or so with the aggressive deregulation of the banking and insurance industries.    What Moore is actually critical of is free market capitalism (along the lines of the Chicago school). And what he is proposing is a liberal democracy. This is essentially Milton Friedman vs Keynes and by now I think the debate should be over and Keynes has won. Japan and Germany are fundamentally capitalist economies, but more regulated than the US.    But Moore doesn't make this distinction clear enough. He instead just keeps criticising capitalism as a whole.

006135323X|3.0|Dan Ariely's book is an interesting toe dip into the murky waters of behavioral economics.  Prompted by his own personal tragedy and his torturous rehabilitation, Ariely has spent much of his life studying the seemingly meaningless choices humans make, and the rationalizations we create for making them.  Everything from cheating to choosing beer is analyzed by him and his team, and the conclusions he draws are fairly interesting.<br /><br />Not all that convincing, though.  Much of his data comes from rather small sample sets, and many of his experiments seem unreplicable.  Plus -- and this is a given in any social science -- his analysis also seems over-simplified.  In the experiment on cheating, for instance, Ariely merely assumes that the students cheat when their scores deviate from the mean (when I would assume it would make more sense to install hidden cameras to catch students cheating).  And when he tries to deduce why people behave in the ways they do, he limits his choices to a few polar contradictions.  He goes for the \\"either/or\\" when, of course, people are far more complicated than one or the other.  Again, it's hard to test for all of the possibilities, but that's also why I'd be more likely to accept his results if his experimental sets were in the thousands instead of just a few hundred.<br /><br />I find his conclusions most intriguing, in fact, when they deal more with the economics aspect of the science.  His points about the presumptions implicit in the free market system are the most convincing of the book.  (I especially like his ideas for credit card companies to reduce debt.)  Don't get me wrong, the book is still a fairly interesting read, even if Ariely's narration is rather weak (and his occasional attempts at humor are eye-rolling).  As a springboard for discussion or a prompt for deeper study, the book succeeds.  In and of itself, though, the book reads more like a nifty nugget of an idea than a revelation of anything new or groundbreaking.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|wonderfully written by an atypical American success story. insight that will be recognized by Americans who have lived abroad and returned to the States with a clearer vision of what most take for granted. Ferguson delivers it to the world with wit and humble honesty.
B00288KNL8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this type of animation.  I like it better than the CGI stuff.  As usual, Tim Burton casts u in a fantastic magical world.  I would have rather had the voices in Coraline British, rather than English, it would have made the film a bit more mystical and intelligent sounding.  The plot was a bit confusing, you really have to pay attention.  I was more fixated on the beautiful, organic animation and vivid colours.  Coraline, Nitemare b4 X-mas, James and the Giant Peach and Corpse Bride are all fantastic films.  I hope they continue to make these types of films, the time they spend to make them is worth it.
B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Knowing they aren't exactly Americas darlings anymore the boys in Alter Bridge plough forth with this, their second full length album of hard rockin' sonics. And the album kicks into gear straight away with the determined riff-mania of Ties That Bind that features the strong musical attacks complemented by Myles Kennedy and his full bodied voice clipping along to the songs cadence. And that subjugation of all to the needs of the song means that the songs here feel stronger and for the overall fine sound created here the production team deserve plaudits - so take a bow Michael Baskette (producer), Dave Holdredge (recording), Jeff Moll (digital engineering).<br /><br />As the album unfolds it becomes clear that consistency is something the band has aimed for. The thick textures of the guitars, the drums of Scott Phillips getting underneath and behind the tunes all topped off by the vocals work a certain charm, if ever there was a restrained and tasteful way of recording an album so that everything was louder than everything else then it's been achieved here. And the power inherent in the overall sound certainly keeps on making you want to push the volume up just one more notch. Not a bad effect to have on a listener eh?<br /><br />My favourite tunes....well they would include Come To Life, Brand New Start and probably Buried Alive for the way it ebbs and flows and the barnstorming Rise Again. Check out these tunes if you are unsure whether to pick this release up or not.<br /><br />Certainly an album that seems to have car stereo decks in mind the guitar solos blaze away in all directions, Mark Tremonti finally with this project being able to break away from the post grunge hard rock formula of not being allowed to really fire up his six string.<br /><br />I can honestly recommend this album to fans of both old and new hard rock.
1400063515|5.0|This book puts forward what might be considered by many to be a revolutionary set of challenges to conventional ways of thinking about several very important topics related to \\"highly improbable\\" events.  The book was written before the current global economic meltdown, and published in April 2007, so its early readers may have found some of Taleb's messages hard to accept.  Since then, of course, we have been through a vivid illustration of one of the things he wrote about.  It is hard to summarize the several interrelated themes of the book -- you really have to read it, possibly twice, to get Taleb's message; but I'll try to summarize one of the most important: the mathematics of Gaussian distributions (also referred to as \\"normal\\" distributions or the \\"bell curve\\") are applied by experts in many fields where the characteristics of the events are absolutely not Gaussian, but are accurately described only by one of several types of power-law or \\"scalable\\" distributions.  By assuming a Gaussian distribution (e.g., for the size of daily market movements), experts underestimate the probability of a sudden, large change by many many orders of magnitude.  As a result, models used by financial institutions and fund managers are, at a fundamental level, complete nonsense.  History shows that within any period of 10 years or so an event occurs that, if market movements were Gaussian, would be a \\"10 sigma\\" event (a probably of something like one in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000).  The very fact that market movements over the last fifty years include several 10-sigma events (under erroneously-applied Gaussian models) is immediate proof, for those who want to see it, that the movements are far from being Gaussian.  The inappropriate application of Gaussian models outside the very few situations in which they apply (e.g., modeling the height distribution of human beings) is a recipe for disaster (as we now know).  Taleb looks at cases of other power-law distributions, such as book sales, website hits, the size of cities, and personal wealth, showing that this class of distributions is so prevalent that they should have been called \\"normal\\" distributions, and the Gaussian should have been called the abnormal distribution.  Taleb writes in a very entertaining style and does not hide his personality, which you will either love or hate; but you should not let your feelings about whether or not you'd like to sit next to Taleb on a long airplane ride detract from the highly logical critiques he presents of accepted thinking about the probability of events that radically change financial markets, technology, societies, and the world in general.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Not very good in my opinion. I knew who the villian was 1/3 of the way through the book. The rather tramatic occurance somewhere in the third quarter; well, I just didn't fall for it. Climax came too early, often felt like reading a textbook, some points repeated (and repeated). Some interesting 'wow, I didn't know that' stuff, but you have to remember the facts are presented from one perspective.
B000002J09|5.0|The MORON reviewer who stated that Led Zeppelin is/was an \\"over rated\\" band should be beaten within an inch of his miserable life with his entire Brittany Spears collection. What an idiot!!! This band has not only stood the test of time but as compared to most of the drivel being recorded today actually gotten stronger over the years. I am, as I type this listening to a boot of a live show they did in Southampton England on January 22, 1973 and trust me they were truly the best rock band on the face of the earth at the time (followed VERY closely by The Rolling Stones) and will still be in heavy rotation on my ipod when I die 30 years from now. Led Zeppelin IV is a masterpiece with every single song on the disc a classic. If you do not already own this album then you really need to start here with this cd and then get the entire Led Zeppelin catalogue as this is truly music for the soul to be cherished for your entire lifetime!
0553582038|2.0|I just finished this book and it was fine.  Clearly just an excuse to make more money as the real book will be the long awaited 5th installment, IF it ever comes out.  Having started the series relatively recently, I have to say I have been pleased, but then taking the time to visit George's website where he talks about all the inane things he is doing BUT finishing his master series, which is what 99.5% of his fans actually care about, I must say his laziness is quite amazing.  Miniatures, other books, comics, football games... clearly there is time in his days to rattle on about this stuff yet he seems to take no time to actually write.    The worst thing that probably happened to the fans is this HBO series because now he has another excuse to do anything but finish a book he promised almost 5 years ago.  Sorry to not take much space to talk about A Feast for Crows, but the more times Martin sees the frustration of his fans, even those of us lucky enough to have started the series late, the more likely he is to finish the series, but at this point I get the feeling maybe he simply does not care to do so.    To those of you who read AFFC when it actually was released, I feel for you, I can't imagine reading that pithy little chapter at the end of the book promising another within the year in JUNE OF 2005!!!    George:  Suck it up sit in front of your computer and finish your story.  There is no HBO series longer term if you don't get the books written.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I received an advance copy of the diamond edition to watch and review.  So, I watched it with my \\"soon to be\\" five year old and was totally blown away.  It was dramatically clearer than I remember.  Technology is truly a wonderful thing...  My son, who'd never seen the movie, but was \\"Grumpy\\" in his class play was singing along to the songs by the end of each one and was still singing all the way to school this morning.  He's seen it four more times and plans to make it five this evening.  I definitely recommend going for the Diamond Edition for all the bonus features.

B002FRNCG0|5.0|I love this album so much that its insane. This album proves why Paramore is my favorite band.<br /><br />Just when I thought that Paramore couldn't get any better,they did! This album shows tremendous growth from this band and every lyric of every song shows how bright this band truly shines.<br /><br />To me,every song shows a peek into the places this band has been and then some.  You won't be disappointed with this album @ all.  If @ all possible,get the deluxe box edition.  That's what I got and it's worth the money.
076790382X|5.0|I'm a huge fan of travel writing and love to live vicariously through other travelers' writing. This book is slightly different from his other works in terms of the subject. In this book, instead of writing about strange lands and travel, he shares what seems like minute observations that he made upon his return to America after being away for 20 years. The short essays are a pleasure to read and are of a good length for busy readers. I identify with his musings on the American way of life as I am an immigrant myself.    Although amusing and comedic, Bryson's observations are also quite astute. Some of stories are also simple and relateable things about his family, which I enjoyed very much. If you're into a well-written, funny, touching and relateable short essays about living in America, this is the book for you!
B002KAJ0AO|3.0|I see comments I like from all the people who posted one but I definitely agree with Anastasia. I've been a huge fan for many years like most BSB followers and I have to say this is the first time I have been a bit disappointed. The album is definitely worthwhile to buy but it is not their best. They did a great job of \\"keeping up with the times\\" but I don't know if it is right for them. I guess it depends on a person's individual taste of music. I like the \\"boring\\" \\"sappy\\"  ballads on the last few CDs like: \\"I Still\\", \\"Climbing the Walls\\", \\"Crawling Back to You\\", \\"Trouble is\\" \\"Love Can Keep You Up All Night\\", \\"Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon\\"..etc....\\" I know it may get old and cheesy for some but I feel the piano driven ballads are what showcase their harmonies best. I feel the lyrics on the last 2 Cds were much more meaningful. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the fast-paced up-tempo stuff but even the \\"ballads\\" on this CD have a thumping base element that kicks in eventually. It's just weird for me to hear BSB say \\"shorty\\" lol  I guess it's good to try new things as an artist so kudos for that. However, I was definitely disappointed that there are only 11 tracks on the album (minus any bonus tracks). I felt a little shorted when I saw that. All-in-all the CD is worthwhile to get for some good up-tempo dance/workout tracks but if you're looking to be touched or inspired by lyrics I'm not so sure this album is for you.
B002JCMZA0|3.0|Diana Krall, surrounded by strings, is one of the ten top jazz vocalists in America.  Absent the strings, in the intimate presence of bass, guitar, drums, and her own piano styling, she is without peers.  It's difficult to understand why she would go to the expense and formatting of an orchestra in order to emulate Julie London and Paul Weston when she deserves to be more rightly compared to Chris Connor, June Christy, or Dakota Staton.  The CD is adequate, the DVD is exciting (with the exception of watching her husband walk out on stage and kiss Elton John instead of his lovely wife).  In Madrid, Krall is in her element.  Whether her background artists are Hurst and Company, or John Clayton and Jeff Hamilton, Diana Krall is in total command both vocally and instrumentally.  She said in an earlier interview that she thought her keyboarding was good, but was surprised to find that audiences liked her voice.  Her jazz vocals are outstanding, but I must agree with her that the real selling point is her approach to the piano and her ability to blend those keys to her combo.  She is the best and, as soon as she realizes that the strings are more detriment than benefit, she'll continue to be the best.

B001CTDH58|4.0|4 of 5 cute stars for this movie. How can you not like a movie with talking Chihuahuas? The Plot? Oh come on, does it really need one? OK, rich dog from you can guess where gets lost in Mexico and has to find her way home. Throw in a talking rat and you have the idea. This is a cute movie that is a bit funny and really easy on the brain. Yeah, yeah, you should see it.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Well, it was just OK. After such a long wait with all the hype of [[ASIN:0385504209 The Da Vinci Code]] I was hoping for more. The baddie is creepy, The subject matter is promising(There is a great Mason mystery out there to write), but the mystery is weak, and the last tenth of the book brown seemingly tries to reach for gravitas which is just not there. I'd probably skip this one. If you like his style read one of his earlier books like [[ASIN:1416580824 Angels & Demons - Movie Tie-In: A Novel]] or [[ASIN:0743497465 Deception Point]]. Neither are fine literature, but they are better than this.

I was sooo pissed... this item did not say anywhere that it was used or 2nd hand.

B002KAJ0AO|3.0|Backstreet's back (all right) with a new album, `This is Us'. Off hand, this release is a slight improvement over the past two `comeback' records. `This is Us' is really, at the heart, a typical Backstreet Boys release - it's rooted in pop, it has all the harmonies that made the group unique, it has some rather cheesy lyrics. What struck me most was how the music of this release sounded similar to the group's early material. The last few records released by the group weren't bad but felt as if the group had lost touch of its core audience. The material was far too slow, serious and out right boring for a group that founded its career on dance and pop hits. `This is Us' is not like that. It definitely tries to find the group's groove and leaves behind that attempt to score an older audience in hopes of striking a chord with a younger one.<br /><br />The Good: Finally, the group takes on dance/pop songs again. \\"Straight Through The Heart\\" sounds like a classic pop that the group is known for. It's upbeat, fun, definitely not serious and similar to the group's hit \\"The Call\\" and \\"As Long as You Love Me\\", deals with love and relationships gone awry. \\"Bye Bye Love\\" is another stand-out track and reminded me a lot of Chris Brown's \\"Forever\\".  \\"If I Knew Then\\" is another good song that fits the group's usual style - upbeat, pop with a hint of R&B that makes it sound a bit contemporary yet clearly identifiable as a Backstreet Boys song. The fact that the group made an attempt to return back to the style and genre of music that made them famous is what makes `This is Us' a decent record and perhaps a better attempt at a `comeback' that then past two records that seemed very out of touch, very much against the group's image and simply forgettable.<br /><br />The Bad: The group's attempt to make a record that is very dance/pop is both the greatest strength and weakness of the record. While the group seems comfortable in its dance/pop genre of music, it seems a bit awkward and out of place with the attempt to make the music appeal to a younger crowd. \\"PDA\\" is a good example of the groups awkwardness; a pop song with a lyric about them wanting to \\"touch all over her booty\\". While I definitely enjoyed the fun, care-free mood of the record, a lot of these songs did not sound as if they belonged in 2009. They sounded as if they were made for the Backstreet Boys fans of the late 1990s. If this record were released earlier in the group's career, it really would have been a hit. But now, the music and style sounds a bit dated and, dare I say, cheesy. Some of the lyrics made me cringe. While the songs were fun and carefree, I didn't feel as if they were produced with today's audience in mind. The songs are good but there was little done to make them feel updated and modern. To me, it was something of a turn off and disappointment.<br /><br />In all, if you're a fan of the group, especially the group's early career and style of music, this is for you. For others curious of it, I'm on the fence. Yes, it's dance/pop so if you're in search of something light and carefree, or perhaps workout music, `This is Us' shouldn't disappoint. If the list of producers the group worked with had you wondering if this meant the Backstreet Boys had finally updated their sound to fit into modern times, think again. The music, for the most part, sounds like it is from the late 1990s/very early 2000s. There are a few songs that are an exception; but those songs in some way just reminded me of takes or rip-offs of other popular songs and did not sound entirely original to the group. If I could, I'd give this 3.5 stars because it really isn't a bad release, it just suffers from cheesy lyrics and a sound that makes them seem out of sync with their audience and the music scene. It's good, but I hope this release is just a warm-up before the group really finds its audience and sound that'll make them fit into today's market without sounding out dated.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Bye Bye Love\\", \\"This Is Us\\", \\"All of Your Life (You Need)\\".Us\\", \\"All of Your Life (You Need)\\".

B0024NSG2K|3.0|As we all know this was a 2005 reboot of the Batman franchise after the God awful Batman & Robin & 8 years of development hë** we got a fresh stat & Chris Nolan I like your direction. Itstars Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman Micheal Caine as Alfred Liam Neeson as Henri Ducard/Ra's Al Ghoul Katie Holms as Racheal Dawes Gary Oldman as Gordon Cillan Murphy as Dr. Crane/Scarecrow Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox & Tom Wilkinson as Falcone. The story is about a gangster Joe Cool who goes & kills Bruce Wayne's parents after a few years Joe Cool gets out of prison & is killed by 1 of Falcone's men Bruce was going to kill him. In Gotham the crime rate is high Bruce leaves the country eventually he meets Henri Ducard where you know he gets his training he later lears about a plot to destroy Gotham City he refuses & turns on the league of shadows goes back to Gotham City to put an end to Falcone & all evil. Flaws I wasn't to high on the suit or the Batmobile there ok but but the Burton era suit & Batmobile were better.
0525421033|5.0|IF I STAY is a gripping story told by Mia, a teen girl pressed to make a difficult decision.

I won't lie. I really enjoyed this book. It's sad, but not overly so. I was cheering for Mia to stay! I won't tell you if I got my wish, but I will say I think it had a happy ending.

0975991477|5.0|For a long time I have had feelings deep inside from a scientific view point that there is a lot more going on undernieth than we all thought possible. I have read several wite papers that are refered to in this book and the evidence is without standing by itself in their conclusions. Quatum Physics goes even farther in the understanding of said proven events and findings. Now there will be neigh sayers out there and they are the ones who FEAR change. For FEAR has a strong hold on our and many other Scocieties at large and it controls the thoughts and beliefs of their patrons. THis book and Dr Liptons findings are very conclusive and procise. It can get quite deep at times and a bit of early learnings is advised, for there will be a lot in here that you will, if you follow what he is tellings you, find the need to acquire and fast. New Biology, Quantum Physics and Metaphysics, together are starting a new trend that is taking off and fast. I call it the New Spirituality or as Neal Donald Walsch would say a remembering of what IS.    This book just takes a leap farther ahead with what teachers and masters have been saying for years. Believe it or not, it is up to you. It always has been and it always will be.    Rev. Lee
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic show. My girlfriend and I, both Mechanical Engineers in college, thought this show was extremely funny and we could not get enough. Unfortunately that means that we watched both seasons in about a week. :( This show has high intelligence humor so I would highly recommend it to those who can get their share of physics jokes but I think that most people could enjoy this show because of the other humor in the show. Great show, can't wait for season 3!
B000AU9UYC|3.0|Look for the 2009 release on page 2 or just look in my reviews. I was naming off some  flaws of the movie another 1 is Scarecrow taking basically a backseat to Ra's Al Ghoul but yeah I like this movie not as much as the Tim Burton Batman but Batman Begins is better than that sorry ä** piece of s*!t Batman & Robin. Chris Nolan your a d@** good director you did a good job.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|This Snow White is Loaded.....      Now keep in mind that I viewed this DVD on a standard definition tv...I know, I know, what was I thinking.  The improvements in this film were remarkable to say the least.  The kids and I (ages 11 and 4) had watched the original version just prior to viewing the Diamond Edition so that we'd be able to note the differences.  Let me tell ya, no prior viewing was necessary.        Right away you notice how much clearer the images are.  In the original you had a lot of blah colors and not a lot of line definition.  In the diamond edition the colors are crystal clear (even in standard def) and the images stand out a lot more.  At one point I recall telling the kids to pay close attention to the water....it actually looks like it is moving.  The images stand out in 3D.  Something I never though possible from a film of yesterday.  They really put a lot of time into recreating this masterpiece.  All while not ruining the classic image.  It was very tastefully done.        Now I did notice things from time to time.  Mainly that the pixels are pretty visible where there is a lot of color concentrated in one place.  A good example is the seven dwarves outfits when they are crossing the bridge coming home from the mine and another incident when Snow White is in the woods with the huntsman.  But those are minor concerns when you see the awesome clearness in the scene where she is running through the woods afraid of all the eyes and creepy creatures.  They made major improvements in that part.        The one thing great about the Diamond Edition is that not only do you get the regular full length feature film but also a 2 disk blue ray of it and bonus features.  And let me tell you....this thing is loaded to the max with bonuses.  You get a first look of the opening sequence of \\"The Princess and the Frog\\", a lot of behind the scenes footage (including a possible sequel that Walt was working on), music video of Tiffany Thornton, audio commentary, and they even throw in some games for the kiddos....or you : )  Games are \\"What do you see?\\", \\"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall\\",  and \\"Dopey's Wild Mine Ride\\".        Another great feature is the fact that it will remember where you stopped the movie at and make sure you can restart it from there next time you go to view it.  This feature comes in super handy when you have little ones with short attention spans....you know, like a typical four year old.        In summary this movie is an excellent value for the entire family.  So what if you already own Snow White on VHS, it's time to update your collection.  And this is the perfect way to do so.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|This movie has chapters-sort of like Kill Bill. Many of them have you holding your breath intense. It's not a comedy, but a big time drama. Although there are some funny lines in it. It is very Quentin Tarantino, very good! The ending is great-too bad history didn't really go down like that! I definately recommend it.

B0016LTNL4|5.0|This movie made me laugh out loud on and off through the whole thing! I was so surprised at that! It's about family, family secrets, getting along with or not getting along with, stuff that happens when family gets together-how you have to sometimes get along and accept the crap that comes along with family, etc! Who can't relate to that. If you watch it, I hope you like it!
B000XUUQQK|3.0|This is another movie i bought with caution seeing as how i thought the first boogyman wasnt that good.but when i watched it i was quickly shown this would be alot different.first off its NOT rated PG-13 which is a BIG plus as i hate PG-13 horror movies.this one had blood,gore and creative kills.the story was better then the last movie and it dosent really connect the first two films except to talk about the main character from the first one and show his picture.this story also made slightly more sense then the frist and the setting(basically an insane asylum)is also better.if you find it $10 or less or come acroos it on cable(without commercials)then watch it and its not a bad way to pass the time.
B00005K3O4|5.0|about this movie. Those people are obviously uptight with no sense of humor. This movie is fun and ridiculous but creepy at the same time. It's a great low budget film and is a cult classic. It deserves 5 stars. In no other movie will you find clowns uglier and scarier than in this movie.
B00005AG7K|2.0|The quality of this dvd is terrible. The movie is great having seen it in much better quality on the BBC. Not even an official release makes this a clear sign to stay away from this dvd. Wait a few more years for the offical release from Apple and when it is digitally remastered.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|...because Whitney needs to do so, so much better than this in order to qualify for a true comeback. There are people 20 years younger than her who have made better albums than this, and Amazon should be terribly ashamed of themselves for calling it her best work yet. To her credit, Whitney never descends into childish immaturity like a certain other well-known female singer has been known to do lately, but sadly just about everything else that made her one of the most unforgettable divas of the 80s and early 90s is simply gone, with little or no hope of it ever coming back. The opener, \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" is definitely not a good way to get things going, with Whitney's voice having deteriorated almost to the point of sounding totally anonymous. This is sadly the case on all of the midtempo tunes, the ever-whiny Akon doesn't help much, and even on the ballads, it's not hard to tell that she's struggling. \\"A Song For You\\" is decent, with an uplifting and positive message and a nice piano intro, and later ascends into a steady but restrained dance rhythm. The title track is probably the best song, retaining the warm, comforting feel of a great Whitney ballad like \\"Didn't We Almost Have It All\\" or \\"I Have Nothing,\\" but even on it, her voice still fails to reach the great heights that it did on those songs, and if this is what's generally to be expected of future Whitney releases, then you're better off sticking with her older, classic material.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|You know what, just watch it! So good. Every episode. This is one of only 3 tv series that I fell in love with and was almost heart sick when it went off the air. Trust me!

B0000524CY|5.0|First of im a HUGE horror fan and it takes ALOT to scare me.in fact this is the ONLY movie that still scares me to this day.this is how horror movies should be made.creepy,chilling.haunting and downright scary.the story,acting and effects all came together just right right to form a horror masterpeice the likes of which hasnt been seen since and might never be seen again.the make-up effect are especially horrific and if seen alone in the dark will induce nightmares and make you paranoid to walk down the dark hallways of your house.watch it and you wont regret it,horror fans will love it but prepare to sleep with the lights on.
B00000DFSK|4.0|For casual U2 fans, the sort of people who jumped on board with 'Pride' or 'With Or Without You', this album provides as good a summary as you can get of the band's early days. Nearly all of the band's important early songs are here: 'I Will Follow', 'Sunday Bloody Sunday', 'New Year's Day', 'Pride', 'Bad', 'Where the Streets Have No Name', 'I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For', 'With Or Without You', 'Desire', 'All I Want Is You'. To be honest, it's almost impossible to go wrong with the set of hits U2 churned out through the 80's.     On the other hand, there isn't that much here for die-hard fans, who would have all the studio albums anyway. A re-recorded version of B-side 'The Sweetest Thing' is the only \\"new\\" song here, and while it's pleasant enough, it's probably not worth the price of a new album. Another problem is that the songs are not in chronological order; given each album had a slightly different feel, it would have been better if we could follow their musical progression from post-punk wannabees to stadium rock superstars.  And I'm not sure that 'Rattle And Hum' deserved FOUR songs on here, especially since tracks like 'Gloria' and 'Bullet The Blue Sky' were left off. Either of those two would be more deserving of a place than 'When Love Comes To Town', for example.     These minor quibbles aside, 'Best Of 1980-1990' is a strong collection that provides an accurate representation of the first phase of U2's career for casual fans.    [4.5 stars]
1577312082|5.0|Eckhart Tolle is the spiritual teacher of our age, and The Power of Now is the most important book/CD set I've ever read/heard.  I just bought another set for a friend.
0439023483|3.0|The story was to much detail. Wish it would get to the punch line and not so much dressing. Seems the story drag on the first half and picked up during the last four chapters. I would recommend reading this book if you have a lot of time.  Get to the point please. The romance part was weak.
B0021L8UPS|3.0|I'd rate this movie as average, not bad, not real good. A little predictable. I hate it when example.-husband believes the orphan girl over his wife-when crazy and bad things are happening, through the whole movie. That gets very annoying! But I would say, it is good enough to rent.
B001C4CI8U|3.0|Well, I must confess that I am a bit surprised about the high number of raving reviews for \\"Fringe\\". I did get the set and went through it in a week. I must say that some episodes were truly brilliant, however some were so out there that the viewer must put aside all gray matter to be able to enjoy the show. If you like conspiracy theories and suspect that the governments are not telling us everything that we should know then you will have a great time.  Unfortunately, even the best shows do fail at certain time (even the incredible BSG faltered in its final episodes), so I can live with the complete lack of believability in some episodes. What I can not live with is the horrible acting and cliche attitudes of some of the key characters. Anna Torv is cold as ice. Yes, we know she is under duress and all that but can't anybody other than the Bishops show some emotion, please? She is so wooden, I am starting to doubt she is an android manufactured in the lab of Walter Bishop. And don't make me start on Broyles! He is so over-the-top with the tough boss cliche that I want to strangle myself whenever he is on screen.  John Noble is the greatest thing in this series and Joshua Jackson is the second best.   Walter Bishop could be the sole reason to watch Fringe because he is the only person really alive in the series. He adds emotion, intelligence and quirkiness which makes the show interesting. He is a great actor and it shines even through all the overshadowing blunderings.  I think the show has potential if it can build on its strengths (I don't want to give away anything but if the character revealed at the season finale is here to stay then I am certainly on board for the next season) while eliminating its shortcomings. I do hope that they can do it.
B00006LIRI|2.0|After seeing what a great job was done with '1980-1990', it's hard to believe '1990-2000' could be stuffed up so badly.     Unlike '1980-1990', there is at least some fodder for the die-hard fans in the non-album track 'Hold Me, Thrill Me...', 'Miss Sarajevo' from the Passengers project, and two new songs. However, once again the album seems targeted primarily at the more casual U2 fan, and here is where the problems arise. U2's work in the 1990's was more experimental and less accessible than their early work, but whoever put this album together was obviously worried this would scare off the casual listeners. So the collection seems to be based on which songs sound most like old-school U2 than what is most representative of U2's actual output over this period.    The three issues I have with the album are:    1) The \\"two new songs\\" deal, which does nothing except take up space that could be used for other hits. 'Electrical Storm' is okay, but 'Hands That Built America' does nothing for me.     2) The inclusion of album tracks such as 'Gone' and 'The First Time', which again just takes up space. The former has become a live staple, so there's some justification there, but what's the excuse for 'The First Time'??    3) The ATYCLB tracks, representing a conscious back-to-basics sound, don't fit that well on an album designed to showcase U2's more experimental work. 'Beautiful Day' and 'Stuck In A Moment..' probably would have been better saved for a future '2000-2010' release.     So there's potentially four or five songs here that really shouldn't be, which only invites speculation as to what should have been included instead. And unlike '1980-1990', there are plenty of important songs that are missing from this collection. Leaving out 'The Fly', 'Who's Gonna Run Your Wild Horses' and 'Lemon' is unforgivable. And I'd suggest 'Mofo', 'Please' and even 'Zooropa' are much more deserving than a few tracks here.     This is not even counting the non-chronological way in which the songs are presented, nor the fact that the less accessible tracks such as 'Numb' are presented in remixes that try to make them sound as old-school U2 as possible. If you're trying to present a band's most experimental work and try to cut out the experimentation, what are you left with?    Sure, there are some good songs here; 'One', 'Mysterious Ways', 'Beautiful Day', 'Stay', 'Miss Sarajevo', 'Even Better Than The Real Thing', 'Until The End Of The World'. But in no way can this be described as an appropriate summary of the band's output from 1990-2000. It gets a low mark not because the music is poor, but because the album simply does not do what it is supposed to.     [2.5 stars]
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Over the years I have quit watching most TV but we happened to have HBO free for a month and I got hooked on the \\"True Blood\\" series so much so that when season 2 came on my husband and myself signed up for HBO again just so we wouldn't miss it. It is the most awesome show ever and I can't wait to purchase season 2 when it comes out on DVD!

B0026RHR6K|5.0|Es una magnífica serie de ciencia-ficción, la trama es interesante con una narración cautivadora. Tiene buenas actuaciones y muy aceptables efectos especiales. Los cambios que presenta respecto a la serie original son muchos pero en general resultan altamente positivos para la historia. En este combo vienen las cuatro temporadas completas junto con abundante material extra incluyendo escenas borradas (no todo el material extra está subtitulado pero en su mayoría sí). También incluye una figura de Cylon de regular calidad.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|Amazon's SAY'S the disk also comes Colorized WRONG! ! !<br />NO COLORIZED version on this disk.

B001IYCMNA|5.0|I recently purchased two of these Cisco WAP4410N WAPs.  The goal was to help my brother-in-law cover his large home with good quality wireless.  Based on my experience doing previous WAP installations, my guess was that is would take between three and six WAPs to full cover his large house (which has lots of brick and steel) with good quality coverage.  I was impressed that by strategically positioning the units I was able to cover the entire house with only two of these WAPs.  The coverage consisted of three floors (one was a finished basement).    The setup of these units was simple, the firmware is stable, and configuration was straight=forward.  Since they were setup they have worked flawlessly and required no further attention.    The only thing a bit unusual (for those used to Netgear, Linksys, etc.) is that you have to setup a Cisco account (no charge just register online) to be able to download firmware, etc.  This ended being unnecessary because the firmware in the unit was up-to-date.    If you're looking for really good WAPs that support Wireless-N and have lots of configuration options (e.g., Mesh, Multiple SSIDs, etc.) I highly recommend this unit.  It has a slightly higher price than other (consumer units) you can buy, but it definitely deserves the \\"business-class\\" label that Cisco gives it.
B002QNGKGW|5.0|For those of you waiting for Dexter to start up full steam this is a great teaser. It is edited for content since its the same free episode available on Showtimes website.<br /><br />Unfortunately we'll have to wait until showtime shows all the episodes before we can get them via Amazon. Showtime being a pay service(with their own on-demand service) most likely is holding any additional episodes until the end of the season. At that time we'll be able to buy them in bulk unedited for a much better rate than the per episode rate.
1881273156|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend for my fiancé and I to read before we got married.  I had no idea what to expect and was quite busy with school, but decided to give it a try anyways.  I let him read it first.  He loved it and was really excited to tell me about it before he had even gotten to the meat of the book.  It was a quick read with many lessons applicable to us as a couple about to be married and contained profound christian principles stated in ways I found eye-opening and refreshing.  As I picked up the book to read it, I thought I would skim the first couple chapters and set it aside until the next week.  I became engrossed by what I was reading so thoroughly I was taken back to my childhood reading days when it would be hours before I even looked up.  The truths were presented in several different ways throughout each section.  There were real-life stories and summaries and suggestions.  Not only will you say, I've always known so-and-so liked or disliked that, now I see it!  But you will also be able to reflect and formulate a plan to establish a more positive and loving environment for everyone around you when you communicate with people using their primary love language.  At the end are two quizzes for you and your partner to pinpoint your love languages.  I highly recommend this book to all couples (even in the dating stage, you can't start too early with the communication process!) and encourage you to look at the other versions tailored to both adolescents and singles.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Well, let's cut to it:    PRESENTATION:  PLAIN HORRIBLE! what is it with Madonna and her videos? the art is horrible! the paper is so bad quality that when I received mine and opened, I really thought this was an illegal copy like the ones you can get on the street. When is the queen of pop gonna release something on video that looks great? So many artist release their videos in such great presentations and menus, some special features will have been greatly appreciated to really CELEBRATE, behind the scenes, interviews or special presentations like the MTV Vogue that you can find in the Immaculate collection version.    THE SOUND:  it's OK, just O-K! it sounds better than Immaculate collection, it does, but is still unforgivable that there is no DTS track or a REAL 5.1.     THE CONTENT:  It is fabulous to seat down a see all this videos together and experience how Madonna has come all the way with her music and artistic expression. I enjoyed a lot, but.... how can 2 of the more stylish of her videos be missing like OH FATHER, DROWNED WORLD and NOTHING REALLY MATTERS, this is NOT a complete collection, PERIOD.    THE QUALITY:  If you pop immaculate collection on your DVD and compare the image, you will see ( with a sharp eye ) there is a small boost in image quality, but really, is this the best they could come up with.    FINAL THOUGHTS:  This just feels like a poor product with no consideration to the fans, not any effort to make a quality DVD on the level of the queen of pop, and is sad to feel Madonna doesn't really works as hard as in her concerts or her music, on the media released to he public. I wish she really learn from Bjork on this.  The 3 stars are because I appreciate some videos not released before on DVD, and the rush I had watching them,  but, this is simply..... an insult product for a Madonna fan,  an O-K product for a casual Madonna buyer.
0385495323|5.0|This is a great read, more of a series of short interesting stories about codemakers and codebreakers. It goes into some technical detail of methods used in cryptoanalysis for the more technically minded, extremely well researched with all the historical facts. One of the few books I read a second time.
B0021L9ME6|5.0|Bark! There goes that catwoman. So detested by every critic and fan because of what it didn't do. They lack imagination. The production design is as cute as Berry and is 'pretty' instead of looking bad*ss. Story is light as a twinkie and less harmful; but lacks the darkness and source elements. I liked its feminine, cat voodoo-babble and Disney-Naughty style. It's another film people love to hate, that I like. The picture is great, as is the sound; but do you care?
B0029LHW4U|5.0|A new vocalist in a band will almost always leave most dedicated fans of a band skeptical as to whether the band will still be as great as they were or not. Now, I have a great amount of respect for Layne Staley, may he rest in peace. Layne was a unique and greatly talented vocalist, but William Duvall is able to fill his shoes in my opinion, and judging by the high rating of this album, the opinion of many, many others.    \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is a mysterious and atmospheric album full of mystical melodies, crushing riffs, lush acoustics, and the strange and beautiful vocal harmonies of William with guitar wizard Jerry Cantrell. Even though Jerry wrote most of these songs on his own, the album is still very worthy of being mentioned alongside such AiC classics as \\"Dirt\\" and \\"Facelift\\". However, whereas those albums where somewhat atmospheric, but in a more psychedelic way, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" has an overall different sound. It's the sort of album you crank at night while driving down a foresty highway. Granted, I did say \\"crank\\", so this is still a metal album, and the mysterious vibe doesn't take away from the heaviness on the heavier songs.    \\"All Secrets Known\\" is a slow and majestic song featuring a crunchy riff and great vocals. Although Alice in Chains albums did start off with a faster-paced song, such as \\"Them Bones\\" or \\"We Die Young\\", \\"All Secrets Known\\" is perfect for starters and sucks you into the dreamy vibe of the album.  \\"Check My Brain\\" is an instant modern classic in my opinion, featuring a heavy, chromatic riff that blares like a guitar-siren. The songs instantly gains a truckload of amazing melody in the chorus, where the vocal harmonies and huge-sounding chords come in, making for a great sing-a-long section.  \\"Last of My Kind\\" has a sound that would be quite familiar with earlier Alice in Chains hits such as \\"Sea of Sorrow\\", because \\"Last of My Kind\\" has a sort of hair-metal shout-a-long chorus reminiscent of Van Halen, the sort ofsound that Alice in Chains was influenced by earlier on. A great, catchy tune and one to bang your head to.  \\"Your Decision\\" is a mellower, happier song that features some very nice acoustic work and gives for a nice release from the heavier songs, while still giving us more great vocal harmonies.  \\"A Looking In View\\" is a full seven-minute, sludge-metal riff-fest that features darker melodies but still makes for a great song.  \\"When The Sun Rose Again\\" may be one of my top favorite songs on the album. Between the melodic acoustic guitars, dreamlike percussion and vocal harmonies that sing out the mysterious lyrics, this song shows the band at the top of their game. Jerry Cantrell also whips out an awesome guitar solo, which sounds great with his distorted guitar over the clean, acoustic guitars. Ironically, the sort of song that would be ideal to play while getting intimate with your lover, this is definitely one of the best songs on the album.  \\"Acid Bubble\\" is another seven-minute song in the vein of \\"A Looking In View\\", where the band goes back to dark but still melodic sludge-metal, full of heavy riffs and psychedelic soloing.  \\"Lesson Learned\\" features an awesome groove with more heavy riffs and sing-a-long metal verses. This song is rather similar to \\"Check My Brain\\", and keeps a consistently good vibe going on.  \\"Take Her Out\\" is a slower song which kicks off with a nice guitar lick going over chugging chords. The song swells up for the chorus and makes everything sound huge, making for yet another great song.  \\"Private Hell\\" is a sad more acoustic-based song that seems deeply personal, coming from Jerry Cantrell. Although it's not a bad song at all, it's not one you'd want to listen to when you're feeling good.  \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" is the closing title track, and the shortest song on the album at only 3 minutes. This song features some nice piano work, adding to the mysterious vibe, and the whole song passes rather quickly, which may leave the listener feeling odd, but it's still a good song.    This album is one of those few albums where just about every song is nearly flawless. Although I did want to detract a star, for both the fact that I would've liked to hear Jerry solo a bit more, and for the vibe the last two or three songs gave, which kind of messed with the more dreamlike atmosphere of the rest of the album, I just can't give this album less than five stars. When you consider the passing of Layne Staley, getting a new vocalist and the fact that this is their first effort together as anew, \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" truly deserves five stars. As I stated, this album is nearly flawless, especially considering all the difficulties the band has been through. I imagine in another three years or so Alice in Chains making another album that's just as good, and hopefully, even better, if that's possible! Very highly recommended for Alice in Chains fans, and for listeners who want an album that's both heavy and atmospheric. This album is destined to be a modern classic. Thanks for the time, and peace.

B002KVSJ64|4.0|One of the best of the current crop of hard rock bands, Breaking Benjamin pen another morbid love letter to \\"Dear Agony.\\" After the platinum successes of [[ASIN:B000G6BL7E Phobia]] and [[ASIN:B0002A2VS2 We Are Not Alone]], most bands would try to keep cloning their past efforts and go for the big pop single. Fortunately, BB chart their own course. The lead release, \\"I Will Not Bow,\\" may be tagged to a Hollywood blockbuster ([[ASIN:B00275EHCI Surrogates]]]), but it's no sappy \\"Top Gun\\" type of ballad. It's all guitar crunch and minor key hook, with Ben Burnley scowling \\"fall\\" in that cookie-monster growl of his.<br /><br />Burnley is also one of the neat things about BB. He's a lead singer that exudes charisma (the \\"I Will Not Bow\\" video really plays off his looks), and he offers the band his lyrical power. The man has some dark obsessions; as I noted on a review of \\"Phobia,\\" there's a lot of death and dying in his defiance. Put Aaron Fink's rumbling guitar underneath that sentiment, and you get some bone-crunching music (\\"Fade Away\\").<br /><br />That's not to say they aren't sensitive guys. They bring a string section on board for the \\"Anthem of The Angels\\" and closing \\"Without You.\\" There's also the astonishing \\"What Lies Beneath.\\" \\"Dear Agony\\" runs solid from thunderous beginning to string saturated end, an album you can play all the way through. It may be \\"Agony,\\" but then again, there's no gain without pain. And Ben Burnley loves to bring the pain.

B0014CQNTK|5.0|Juno is one of those rare films, like 1996's \\"Jerry McGuire\\" which starred Tom Cruise in one of his greater performances, that leaves you feeling good and refreshed after youve seen it, then makes you want to tell someone else to see it, then youll see it again as if you didnt see it already. Its that good. The great Ellen Page (i love her) plays Juno, a cute, hip, at times smart-alecky teen whose life is turned upside down after she discovers shes pregnant by her best friend. I know some people made a slight fuss over this film because they thought it was glorifying teen pregnancy, but i think they totally missed the point. The filmmakers, including director Jason Reitman and first time scriptwriter Diablo Cody, handle this scenario with wit and a sweetness that doesnt seep into annoyance or contrivance, which another filmmaker mightve felt compelled to do.<br />This is a great film with characters that we totally invest our time and energy with, from J.K. Simmons as Juno's understanding yet firm dad, to Allison Janney as her no-nonsense stepmom, all the way to Jason Bateman and Jennifer Garner as the young yuppie couple who want to adopt Juno's baby but have some major issues of their own, to Michael Cera, great as the young, innocent soon to be dad. There is not a bad performance in the bunch, none whatsoever. I saw this film in a theatre and loved it simply because here was a story that didnt have car explosions, shootouts, nasty people screaming foul language at each other....just a nice, original human story with human characters that we all could relate to and sympathize with and who made us laugh, care and root for. Get It.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I didn't began watching this show until mid-season and when I saw the episode I had to go back and watch from the beginning. I love this show. It has action, romance, and comedy. I am a huge fan of both the books and the show. I did not even know the books until I first began watching the show and even though the show does not really follow the books it is fanscinating all on its own. I think the acting is brilliant and they all have great chemistry. I will admitt I did not think it would be the \\"best show ever\\" but it is and I cannnot wait until season 2!
B002Q5C4QK|1.0|Plain and simple, their music sucks and it sound like someone took a dump on the vocals.   I am not a singer but I can evaluate good music and this crap belongs on the Disney channel.
B00005JL78|4.0|One major difficulty with a film of this sort is that seriously intended hocus-pocus will turn into comic hocus-pocus. I wouldn't say that this film slid over that line but it does come very close a number of times. For me, having Tom Cruise, in particular, make funny looking gestures and do awkward looking things, however justified by the written word of the script, detracts from my acceptance of the film . At any rate, I was left in something of a muddle as to whether I liked it or not, whether I thought anyone else would like it. Not having resolved that issue in my mind, I will simply say that most of the performers did quite well under the circumstances, there were some quite workable scenes, and there were all sorts of machines and gadgets to satisfy the fans of such. Those who find incredible plots and action generally inane or uninteresting should steer clear.
1597801577|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi's debut novel The Windup Girl is a frightening, realistic and brilliant look at the near future of the world. Taking place in Thailand at some point in the future, Bacigalupi paints a picture of a world that is caught between several major problems: climate change has affected the lives of many people around the world, and in turn, has brought a rise in global agricultural corporations, and global energy resources have been depleted, forcing major changes in the way people live their lives, and how a world-wide economy functions with different resources. Corporations have run amok with trying to maintain their profit margins, and released a number of plagues upon the world that devastated the planet's ecology upon which we all depend, and because of their actions, remain just a single step ahead of the latest mutation of blister rust and other assorted plagues. Thailand is a country that has thus far weathered the storm - the Royal government has maintained a fierce isolationist policy to keep the country from succumbing. As a result, Thailand has a precious resource that western companies desperately want: a genebank, containing thousands of new strains of crops that could be utilized to combat the ongoing struggle against plagues and hunger world-wide.    The story follows several discrete storylines and characters, each with their own motivations and demons. Anderson is a `calorie man', a westerner who ostensibly manages a factory that manufactures kink-springs, a renewable power source. Jaidee is a member of the Environmental Ministry, tasked with maintaining a barrier between Thailand and the rest of the world and the dangers that it poses. Emiko is a windup, a genetically engineered woman, designed by the Japanese for servitude and for sex, who has been abandoned in Thailand and fears that she will be mulched (killed and burned for energy). In addition to these main characters, there are a number of other background characters who are just ascomplex as their counterparts. In a nut-shell, Anderson has come to Thailand on the behalf of a major Agricorporation that is hoping to gain a foothold in the country in order to obtain rights to the country's gene banks. While he is ostensibly looking for ways to combat the plagues, Thailand officials believe that the corporations have far more sinister and selfish motivations for the gene banks. While in the country, he has to walk a narrow line to stay in the country, as the Environmental Ministry intends to keep Thailand free.    Captain Jaidee is a leading member of the Environmental Ministry, and throughout the book, it is clear that the country is not necessarily unified in its position to remain away from the rest of the world. Limited trade and imports occur through the actions of the Trade Ministry, which is at frightening odds with the Environmental Ministry, to the point where open bloodshed and crimes are committed on both sides to try and force their position upon the rest of the country, which eventually interrupts into violence, which helps to push forward some of the plans that Anderson and others have laid to gain more traction into the country.    Emiko's titular character is somewhere between the various storylines. As an artificial biological construct, she is a representation of what is wrong with the outside world in the eyes of a secular nation that believes heavily in the value of one's soul and rebirth. To the Thai people, she is a soulless being, one who is against nature, and essentially lumped in with the problems of the world. Thus, Emiko, who is unsuited for Thailand's climate with reduced pores (she overheats easily) and a body structure that makes her stutter while moving, which makes her a literal odd woman out, and thus a target to the Environmental Ministry (also known as White Shirts for their uniform) who see her as a threat to the country's independence.    Futuristic worlds are a common element in Science Fiction, but it is very rare to have one that is so deeply realized as Bacugalupi's Thailand, one that takes the current state of existence for the country and extrapolates into the future with hypothetical events. The portrait that he paints of the world is very scary indeed, and the constructed world has reacted accordingly though a number of levels. What makes this novel so interesting is just how everything fits together. There are economic elements that make sense, social, biological and political, all of which are not mere exposition in a prologue in the novel, but where they are an active part of the storyline. This, in a way is one of the best examples of show, don't tell, a writing exercise that I remember from creative writing courses. What is even better (or sobering, depending on how you look at it), this world makes sense. I can see major corporations putting profit ahead of common sense, and I can see the world going to hell in much more vivid detail now. Furthermore, Bacugalupi posits the power struggle between various departments of government, each with their own agendas and motives, both at odds with one another, which trails up through to the very end of the book.    There's a strong look at morality and ethics when it comes to bioengineering and the eventual fate of the species, and how our role fits within a society such as what we see in the future. Emiko, a Windup, is shunned, hated, in reaction to what she was, and what she represented: something highly unnatural. By the same token, there are holes in that sort of feeling, as one character confronts towards the end of the novel. One thing that particularly stuck in my mind was how much of evolution is an unnatural, random occurrence, verses how much of it is conscious decisions that any sort of creature makes that better enhances their chances of survival? In this world, survival is predicated on the work of gene rippers and scientists who remain just a couple of steps against plagues - it is noted that the windups are built for a purpose, and that they are immune to most problems in the world because of their unique design. Like the clashes in the Thailand government, there is a larger struggle at stake, survival, with both sides making valid arguments for their continued existence. In a sense, this story is a look at how the human race might choose to survive, and enter a new stage of development. To me, this is a very profound element to the story.    When all is said and done, there is one big theme that goes through and through with this book: survival. Each element of the book deals with this very issue, from the ultimate survival of the human race in a hostile world, to the immediate survival of several characters who are neck deep in political and economic conspiracy to the various branches of government who want to see their vision of the future for their country to survive the coming turmoil.    What truly stands out for this book is the rich detail and fantastic prose. I've purposely taken my time with this book so that I could absorb as much as I could. What Bacugalupi puts together is a superior story, one of the best science fiction novels that I have read in a long time, one that takes the best from well thought out characters, plausible economics and science and a complicated story.

The epiphanies are telegraphed.  Somehow, Langdon has become an idiot and is repeatedly adamant about some point and subsequently shocked to discover he was wrong.  There is serious overuse of characters knowing or seeing something the reader doesnt-- a cheesy device better used in bad movies.  The big reveal is exceedingly lame.  The end is weak, preachy and too slow to arrive.    Other than that, not bad.
B001NESPHC|4.0|Melody Gardot is a great singer and composer;  because she wrote al her own material for this   CD except one (Over The Rainbow) it takes a   few listenings to get to know the songs.  But after that : great variety of songs and   a pleasant voice to listen to. Keep up the  good work, Melody !
B000Y179KO|5.0|Great album from start to finish.  Had a tough time finding this CD in stores...so had to connect with a private seller on the net.  Glad I did...would not have wanted to miss this one!
0307266303|5.0|I bought this book for my husband who used to compete in track and then coached both track and cross country for many years at the high school and community college levels.  He was so hooked on the book that he has bought several copies more for some of his ex-athletes, including those who became coaches themselves.  My husband (74-years-old) runs 3 miles on a regular basis, and he found himself running faster when thinking about BORN TO RUN.
B001AII4RM|4.0|This is a one of a kind flick, the animations is off the charts and the sound is very detailed. If you like warrior movies i would recommend this flick.
0810993139|5.0|My 8 year old son does not like to read, especially fiction. That said, he really enjoys this series. The stick figure art scattered on every page matches the comical stylings of the story line.<br /><br />It is not exactly an enriching book judging it by the content, but it is enriching to my son in that it encourages him to improve his reading skills.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Well...we waited for this?  Really weak across the board.  Was he getting paid by the word, is that why every statement and concept gets repeated in subsequent chapters?  I enjoyed \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons\\", but this gives fiction a bad name.
B002BVYBBK|4.0|This movie and going to be a classic, the stunning sound and picture on the blu ray version is unmatched making it one of a kind.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone, if you are a racing fan this one is definitely must own.
0385504225|1.0|I want to start off my review by saying that I enjoyed A&D and DVC.  I know that Dan Brown is not a literary genius, but I read thrillers to be entertained and his books are quick, page-turning reads.  That being said, this is the worst book I have ever read.  I waited a few days to write a review because I thought I might have been so disappointed due to the book not living up to all the \\"hype\\", but no this is just plain old garbage.  Here are a few of the problems I had with it:  1) When I read thrillers I relax and read without seriously trying to predict what is going to happen.  Within the first few chapters of this book I had already correctly guessed where they were going to end up in the end.  And as I continued reading, I saw many of the \\"twists\\" coming.  2) There are so many plot inaccuracies in this book it is an insult to the readers.  I won't go into detail about them just in case anyone after reading these reviews still decides to read it (even thought it is not even worth it to read it for a laugh IMO) but ugh!  3) Just like the DVC this book starts off slow, however it never really speeds up.  There is just too much information given to us and at least half of it is not needed, it just bogs down the action.  4) The pseudo-science in this book is just too much for me to take.  If you have read the secret and liked that maybe you can take it but I just found it a cop-out and very disappointing.  5) What I like about Dan Brown's books are that they could \\"almost\\" be true.  Yes I know there is no way they could but in your mind you could almost imagine it happening.  That's what made it fun, wanting to look up a picture of The Last Supper and all the other little \\"facts\\" in the books.  This book has none of that drive, which is ironic considering how much information is thrown at you in the book.  6) The ending is so cheesy I am embarrassed for Dan Brown.  Again I won't go into it in case you are still thinking about reading it.  So to sum it up: If youare thinking about reading this book because you liked A&D and/or DVC don't bother.  It is a watered down mess that I can't believe took 6 years to make.
B001L1INHE|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath,Viking Press, New York, copyright 1939, If have seen the movie, you must read the book. Quote: from Grapes of WRath<br /> Before I knowed it, I was sayin' out loud, 'The hell with it! There ain't no sin and there ain't no virtue. There's just stuff people do. It's all part of the same thing.' . . . . I says, 'What's this call, this sperit?' An' I says, 'It's love. I love people so much I'm fit to bust, sometimes.' . . . . I figgered, 'Why do we got to hang it on God or Jesus? Maybe,' I figgered, 'maybe it's all men an' all women we love; maybe that's the Holy Sperit-the human sperit-the whole shebang. Maybe all men got one big soul ever'body's a part of.' Now I sat there thinkin' it, an' all of a suddent-I knew it. I knew it so deep down that it was true, and I still know it.<br />The Grapes of Wrath<br />Jim Casy in Chapter 4
0307276902|5.0|whether its real or not i really dont think thats an issue, its about if you liked the book or not. i really enjoyed it. its an easy read and very different from most books. i would recommend the book to others and i have and they have enjoyed this book too.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|I think the ideal way to experience this movie is to think of it as the viewing of a bad dream.  David Lynch provides the images and leaves everything wide open for each viewer to interpret.      Lynch claims that Eraserhead is his most spiritual film, and it is set in a rundown industrial society where there doesn't appear to be any quality of life.  Secular pursuits seem pointless for these characters, so maybe spirituality is found in these dreamlike states that Lynch displays here.  All the lead character, Henry, can do to escape his surroundings is stare at a heater and imagine a deformed girl on stage singing \\"in heaven everything is fine\\".  To top it all off, he's trying to take care of his mutant baby while he's on vacation with a girlfriend who is afflicted with sporadic seizures.  Not exactly your typical storyline but there is no need to take anything literally here.        I found this movie to be very engrossing.  The images are very surreal but that's what I was anticipating and was in the mood for.  I also found it to be very humorous in several places.  This review is for the DVD version pictured above.  There aren't many special features on this version, other than a David Lynch bio and filmography.  If you are going to purchase this DVD I'd recommend buying the remastered widescreen version released in 2006.  Either way, this is a great film that everyone with an open mind should experience.
B000EQ5SRK|5.0|Probably one of the biggest critical failures in the history of motion pictures, \\"Sliver\\" centers around a woman (played by Sharon Stone) who moves into a highrise apartment in downtown Manhattan when suddenly many tenants start to get murdered. The owner of the buliding (played by William Baldwin) experiments with voyeuism by videotaping the goings on in the tenant's apartments. The movie is pretty much forgotten today, but many do remember the film for the extreme amount of sex scenes between Stone and Baldwin as well as the amount of male nudity Baldwin shows; in the original cut of the film there was even a frontal shot of his body. The film is pretty empty on plot, but buy the film if you want to see the gorgeous body of William Baldwin; he is not shy in showing his assets. Despite the critical failure of the movie \\"Sliver\\" grossed over $166,000,000 at the boxoffice. The DVD has no bonus features but comes in widescreen. One critic did enjoy the film, however; David Sheehan from NBC says, \\"Don't miss it! Goes beyond \\"Basic Instinct\\"...super, sexy, super-stylish, super suspenseful.\\"
B0029LHW4U|5.0|This record is excellent, flat out. Nice and heavy.    By the time \\"Check My Brain\\" kicks in the years melt away and you're jamming with good old Alice again. These guys haven't missed a beat and it's like they were never gone. The last record that did that for me was Rush's Vapor Trails. The band sounds in fine shape and is playing as good as ever.      William DuVall sounds great and his voice matches the songs, conveys the moods and delivers the lyrics perfectly. Perhaps more important is that he and Jerry Cantrell blend their vocals into a sound just like the good old days. There's really no reason or fairness to compare DuVall and Layne Staley since they are 2 different people with their own respective talents but let's just say that Layne has been done proud.    The packaging is plain and simple with spooky cool pictures. Nice and dark. The production is excellent. Nick Raskulinecz does another outstanding job here. (Is this guy everywhere these days or what?) The sound is nice and even. The instruments and vocals can be easily and clearly heard all the way through the entire record. And you can't play it too loud.    There isn't a bad song on the disc and they show that they still have the flexibility to switch between metal, rock, acoustic and heavy blues. I read in an interview where the band said if you liked early Alice in Chains you would like this record and they didn't disappoint. If you're an old time fan or if this disc is your introduction to the band you really can't go wrong. I would hope that this is the start of Alice In Chains - Part II.
0061719544|5.0|Craig Ferguson's autobiography, American On Purpose, was a very moving look at his life.  I could hardly put it down.  His writing is very honest and sincere.  I found his book to be very relatable.  I even shed a few tears while reading the last chapter or two.  Buy it; you will love it.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|It is not easy for writers and producers to maintain quality on a tv series, but they manage to do it with the 4th season of this entertaining, scary, funny  and provocative series.  Dean is back from hell, the angels are in town, the demons are gearing up, Lucifer is on the rise, and Sam has been taken in by Ruby's lies.  Bobby gets more screen time as the boys' surrogate father figure.  We even get to learn more about John and Mary Winchester before they were married, and how their history with Azazel goes back farther than imagined.    The show also explores spirituality to a degree.  Dean asks the questions that many of us ask:  Why are we here?  Why do good people suffer while evil seems to prevail?  Is there really a god, and what is the nature of this god?   Even the angels have doubts and failings, so it's hard to believe in something higher.    Fortunately, there are also some humorous episodes to take our minds off of the heavy stuff:  \\"Wishful Thinking,\\" featuring Ted Raimi and a giant, live teddy bear; \\"It's a terrible life,\\" with Dean and Sam in an alternate reality as corporate drones; and \\"Yellow Fever,\\" which ends with a nice little music video of Jensen Ackles lip syncing to \\"Eye of the Tiger.\\"    Can't wait for the fifth season!

0385504225|4.0|I'm not sure how people can not like this book. Total page turner, fast paced, several stories going at once... OK, \\"yes\\" there is definitely a pattern to his books and \\"no\\" it's not the \\"big reveal\\" of the DaVinci Code, but how many times can you make that reveal... ONCE. I enjoyed The Lost Symbol and finished it in a little under 3 days.<br /><br />I'd like to see Dan Brown's next book be on Scientology, but I know \\"they\\" would never let that happen.
B002IR3PSC|5.0|Do this: buy this set. Insert the DVD into your video player. Choose 'Track select: Opening.' Then enjoy an hour of the most exceptional Jethro Tull footage heretofore released. Ask: When have you been so richly entertained for $20? But wait, there's more: add the audio tracks that precede and follow the DVD footage, and the companion CD you get, too.<br /><br />We probably have this in common: the whole CD catalog, all the video released to date, the album where the band stands up, and the one that folds out as a newspaper. If I were to select a single favorite Jethro Tull product, it may very well be the concert telecast featured on this DVD. I simply can't recommend it more highly.
B0028K3192|5.0|I love the new cd. Just like all of the rest of his music it leaves me wanting even more. I simply can not wait for the other cd's to come out because I am playing these to death.
B001TODCII|3.0|The good:  Liam Neeson; excellent action scenes. Great payback.     The bad: The acting by the rest of the cast, especially the daughter and wife. The script is pretty average.  And you have to suspend disbelief: 1) No one can kill 30 people; 2)Neeson pretends to be a french policeman in Paris and he speaks english with no accent; what's wrong with that?     Overall, it's worth watching.  Neeson is top notch.
B002KVSJ64|5.0|This album is the first BB album I've owned, though I've been a fan for a while. It's really great, and i enjoy EVERY last song, Dear Agony being my favorite. Honestly, i think that this is a great starting point(CD-wise) on BB for me. Even if you don't think you'll enjoy this album based on the reviews, get it anyway, you'll be surprised.  I'll be sure to buy more BB albums in the future.
B002JTMNX2|1.0|One original member of a band doesn't make the Band what they were in name or otherwise.  This isn't Foreigner!  They were made up of six musicians and although they lost a couple early on, for the most part the core of the group stayed together until the early 90's.  This is essentially a tribute band with one member left.  The new material is okay, Kelly Hansen is a good singer and is able to sound like Gramm.  But the new material is nothing special, it would never make it on it's own either in the classic era of rock & roll or now! It doesn't compare with any of Foreigner's 70's or 80's material.  But to capitalize on the use of the bands name, I dont agree with it.  This is a tribute band, I would never go see them.  I seen the original Foreigner with Gramm five times and they are awesome!
B000FC1K66|5.0|I was wanting to read this for so long, and for some reason I never did until now. I am very glad I did, and that I did before seeing the highly acclaimed movie. I enjoy reading about the holocaust and War War II, but this book had a different edge to it that I just loved. It was compelling and very well written. I only wished it could have been longer. I enjoyed many parts and without spoiling anything especially the third part. I am sorry I waited so long, and now I can enjoy the movie!
B002AGIEYG|5.0|Conductors have big enough egos that they don't hold their breaths waiting for approval, which will shower them anyway. But Simon Rattle has waited a while before meeting Karajan, his illustrious Berlin predecessor, head on in the music that was one of Karajan's greatest strengths.  As toe-dipping exercises we've had a German Requiem and a couple of First Piano Concertos. The four symphonies are the Himalayas of Brahms's output, however, and now that Rattle has taken them on all at once, how has he fared?<br /><br />Sym. #1: From the opening bars the faint rustling of the audience tells us that this is a live concert, but the sound surpasses Karajan's best-engineered studio account (the last, digital one from 1987). It is rich, natural, and detailed. As for the orchestra's overall sound, it's more softly contoured than under Karajan, also not as monolithic. Rattle asks for sensitive, personal playing from his solo players, with less emphasis on the tidal wave of sound that Karajan favored. The phrasing is more energetic than under Abbado, whose Brahms cycle was earnest and unimaginative.  In short, all the technical aspects are first-rate. Who would expect anything less?<br /><br />But the Brahms First enjoys a history of iconic interpretations on disc, and it's up to Rattle to show some individuality. The import of the first movement isn't tragic or driven with fateful energy. In fact, Rattle seems almost relaxed in this music of struggle and conflict. He uses rubato to mold phrases and tries to catch the subtler shades of each mood. Happily, the Berliners can accomplish that while sounding powerful and virtuosic. I can't put Furtwangler's deeply tragic, turbulent account out of my head, but even so, I was engrossed in Rattle's very different approach. This is Brahms played for beauty and tenderness.<br /><br />The second movement continues in the same vein, with exquisite lyrical playing in the strings and woodwind solos. The pace is kept on the urgent side, which helps a great deal to keep the line from dawdling. Far more importantly, Rattle is engaged emotionally, a bit of a surprise but a great relief. The Scherzo is all lightness and restrained ebullience. Brahms can be made more unbuttoned, but this is still wonderfully expressive playing. In the finale, I want a premonitory beginning leading to dark moods that resolve in the sunshine of the great tune. Rattle meets that expectation halfway - the opening is hushed and atmospheric, not brooding. The great horn entry is a hymn, taken slowly and reverentially. Despite the absence of tragic implications, Rattle's way seems valid, even if the big tune doesn't open the skies as it should. We get a lighter, brighter, less dramatic finale that is exceptionally well executed and paced. So count the First a success, setting the tone -- more Bruno Walter than Toscanini -- for Rattle's entire cycle.<br /><br />If comparative timings are of interest, here they are:<br /><br />  Karajan 1987  Rattle<br />Mvt. 1 --  13:22  13:59<br />Mvt. 2 --  8:22  9:12<br />Mvt. 3 --  4:46  4:52<br />Mvt. 4 --  17:38  16:52<br /><br />Sym. #2: The aging Walter (on Sony) was most successful in the Brahms Second, and I anticipated an updated version of his account from Rattle, but far better played and recorded. So it is. Rattle follows the autumnal Walter in being tender and lyrical but not to a fault. The line never sags; the pace doesn't meander. The conductor is alert to supple changes, as he was in the First. There's inner life here, without a hint of Rattle's unwelcome fussiness (or the self-consciousness that spoils the Brahms of Barenboim and Eschenbach). I was convinced that the Second comes naturally to him -- and to the Berliners, of course.  The first movement is less grand than Karajan's but more varied and eager, too. There's even some turbulence in the development. The trick with the slow movement is that it can sound very like the first movement. It's not just a matter of pace but mood; two flowing pastoral movements in a row provide little contrast in feeling. Rattle is effective in making the Adagio non troppo sufficiently brooding and melancholy where he can. Still, the overall pacing and urgent feeling may seem to some listeners an extension of the first movement. Everything else about the slow movement is very satisfying.<br /><br />Brahms undercuts the contrast of the Scherzo by asking for it to be \\"quasi Andantino,\\" but Rattle ignores this to give us a quick-moving Allegretto, not as muscular as Karajan's, who had the same good instincts, but more dancing. I appreciate how light on its feet this movement is after so many dull, dutifully Germanic readings over the years. For once the 'grazioso' element dominates.  The finale of the Second is a slam dunk for any conductor who doesn't make the mistake of dawdling and who dramatizes the explosive main theme. Ideally, the explosion should be one of runaway exuberance (as it was in Walter's mono account with the New York Phil.). Rattle could be more mysterious, and quicker, in the introduction, but once he lets the main theme erupt -- here a fairly soft eruption -- there is an exuberant feeling. Some reticence in the development section feels misplaced, but that's not a major flaw, thanks to the Berliners' alert, vivid playing. In short, Rattle's Second is at least up to the level of his First, and for many may be even better, because the work is more suited to a less than heroic approach. (If only he'd let the orchestra off the reins in the finale.)<br /><br />  Karajan 1987  Rattle<br />Mvt. 1 --  15:45  15:20<br />Mvt. 2 --  9:46  9:39<br />Mvt. 3 --  5:21  5:27<br />Mvt. 4 --  9:20  9:38<br /><br />Sym. #3: The first movement of the Third is generally conceded to be the most difficult to hold together, and it takes a great Brahmsian (Furtwangler, Karajan, Walter, Klemperer, Bernstein) to be totally convincing. Rattle doesn't attack the impetuous, plunging opening measures. He's very successful at providing contrast in the second theme, however, and the pacing, although fairly relaxed, never loses momentum. The Third can be tailored to sound like Brahms's \\"other\\" pastoral symphony, not my preferred approach but certainly viable. Even without Karajan's towering drive, the Berlin strings are magnificent, and Rattle's handling of the whole development section is exciting. The intricate cross-currents of this opening movement could hardly be done better. The second movement is taken at a fairly relaxed pace, also, but you wouldn't notice since the phrasing contains so much variety and shading. Rattle feels this movement with a moody intensity comparable to Bernstein's.<br /><br />The third movement is the least scherzo-like of Brahms's Scherzos, and although Rattle's pacing isn't slow, he never allows the tinge of melancholy to escape. Rattle loves half-light. He has a gift for sad music that's also supple and refined. (In fact, cutting loose with simple joy isn't a thing he seems to welcome.) If you're going to be mournful in the third movement, the finale demands a release. Rattle sets a good strong pace, although not as portentous and mysterious as it might be.  He lets the main theme for cellos and horn have its head -- almost.  I wish the music had broken free completely, but Rattle's control isn't stifling, much less does he make me want to kick him along.  In sum, this is a refined, moody Third that is exceptionally well handled and stupendously played. It doesn't join Karajan at the summit but comes very near.<br /><br />  Karajan 1987  Rattle<br />Mvt. 1 --  9:34  13:51 (taking the repeat)<br />Mvt. 2 --  8:08  9:18<br />Mvt. 3 --  6:15  6:44<br />Mvt. 4 --  9:11  9:18<br /><br />Sym. #4: Perhaps I'm unrealistic, but for me even Furtwangler and Karajan don't fully capture what the Fourth is about.  Their readings, at least four tries from each conductor, aren't comparable in tension and catharsis to their towering accounts of the First Sym.  OnlyCarlos Kleiber, in his legendary recording from Vienna (DG), makes me feel both exhilarated and wrung out at the end. So I come to a parting of the ways with Rattle's lyrical conception of the first movement, which is refined and at times gentle. I hear more struggle in this movement, but setting my expectations aside, his performance is controlled and beautiful, just far too buttoned up. Admirers would call it classically restrained and elegiac.  The second movement can be fervent and anguished -- Bernstein did it that way -- but Rattle takes the usual, more subdued approach. He sounds like Chailly and Dohnanyi,  on the verge of elegance. On its own terms, the performance is undoubtedly eloquent.<br /><br />\\"Jocose\\" isn't a word we use much anymore, but merry is how Brahms wants the Scherzo to sound. The joke may be a bit ponderous, but conductors should at least try. Rattle manages very well. In fact, his conducting wakes up here for the first time in the Fourth.  There's exuberance and thrust; he avoids the temptation to let the heavy bass line add an oppressive weight. I would wish for even more urgency, but this is an exciting rendition. Now to the great finale in passacaglia form. To succeed, it's not enough that the structure be as rigorous as Bach; Brahms's fervent Romantic side much be brought out fully, and in addition, the build-up to the climax must resound tragically.  I feared that Rattle wouldn't have the musical instincts to fuse these opposed aspects, but from the outset he voices the harmony and handles the pacing with great skill (Karajan, for once, is too rough and coarse). Nothing is brash or sloppy here. The middle section grows too ruminative for a brief while, and the flute solo isn't heartrending, but Rattle quickly finds the pace again. No catharsis at the end, alas, but a good, strong finish nonetheless. In short, a mixed decision, with the last two movements being the most persuasive. Other listeners who don't mind a cool, classical Fourth will be happier than I was.<br /><br />  Karajan 1987  Rattle<br />Mvt. 1 --  13:00  13:21<br />Mvt. 2 --  11:35  12:13<br />Mvt. 3 --  6:24  6:25<br />Mvt. 4 --  10:39  10:21<br /><br />No single conductor, with the exception of Furtwangler, has found in these titanic scores as much as Brahms put in them. In modern sound Karajan and Bernstein came closest  -- others would nominate Celibidache. Yet I have no hesitation in calling Rattle's new cycle the best since Karajan's heyday. He's a natural at this music, and hearing the Berliners on sacred ground is itself cause for celebration.<br /><br />P.S. 2011 - a recent listen to Rattle's Brahms prompts me to add that his interpretations are very \\"thought through,\\" which means a certain loss of simple flow and naturalness.  These readings are far from spontaneous-sounding. I should have emphasized that more in the review.ful at providing contrast in the second theme, however, and the pacing, although fairly relaxed, never loses momentum. The Third can be tailored to sound like Brahms's \\"other\\" pastoral symphony, not my preferred approach but certainly viable.

Other listeners who don't mind a cool, classical Fourth will be happier than I was.<br /><br />  Karajan 1987  Rattle<br />Mvt. 1 --  13:00  13:21<br />Mvt. 2 --  11:35  12:13<br />Mvt. 3 --  6:24  6:25<br />Mvt. 4 --  10:39  10:21<br /><br />No single conductor, with the exception of Furtwangler, has found in these titanic scores as much as Brahms put in them. In modern sound Karajan and Bernstein came closest  -- others would nominate Celibidache. Yet I have no hesitation in calling Rattle's new cycle the best since Karajan's heyday. He's a natural at this music, and hearing the Berliners on sacred ground is itself cause for celebration.<br /><br />P.S. 2011 - a recent listen to Rattle's Brahms prompts me to add that his interpretations are very \\"thought through,\\" which means a certain loss of simple flow and naturalness.  These readings are far from spontaneous-sounding. I should have emphasized that more in the review.
0385504225|5.0|Let's get to the actual meat of this book.     America was not founded by Christians at all. It was founded by Freemasons who are not Christians but Deists. If you have read the book then you know that Egyptian lore was much more important to the Masons, and is seen everywhere in Washington D.C., than Christianity, which is not even mentioned in the book.     So how in the world did all of the Right Wing Christians come to the conclusion that America is a Christian nation instead of the philosophy that at the heart of America lies religious freedom?????     Mottos such as \\"In God We Trust\\" were added later (1864) during the Civil War.      Please try to read this book and capture what Brown is actually saying.
0321543726|5.0|What can I say? This book is by far the best choice for a \\"introduction to programming\\" college class or for self study for anyone serious about learning programming. It offers depth, clearness, vision, wisdom and raw technical skill far beyond the reach of any of its competitors..<br />What really amazes me is that Stroustrup has managed to write a book that's really, essentially about learning what programming is and how to do it best, using C++ just as a useful tool avoiding the trap of cherishing and exalting his \\"creature\\" bringing it to center stage and instead letting it do its quiet work in the background.<br />Seeing someone with caliber, history, skills and reputation of Stroustrup, who could just go on being revered writing highbrow terse articles, taking the time and exercising the patience necessary to write a beginner book is really a testimonial to the value of this guy.<br />As an added value, his approach contributes to fight off from the very beginning the confusion that exists in many aspiring ( and unfortunately even is some experts..) programmers about knowing a programming language or knowing the art and science of programming. I find it quite ironical that it should be the job of the creator of a language to underline so effectively the difference between a \\"language lawyer\\" and a good programmer.<br />It is true that the text has many typos and imperfections, as the long errata shows, but being realistic, how many long, clear, detailed, deep technical text don't have mistakes? Even here the author deserves some credit for being so strict and efficient on error correction. Some more proofreading would have surely helped anyhow, that s' a fact, but this issue is largely insignificant compared to the overall quality of the text.<br />There are only two things that I would have loved to see done in a different way. First, I agree with the idea that introducing polymorphism with the classic toy examples reduces the appreciation for its power and usefulness at first, but I think this fault is inevitably and gradually eliminated later on when the students end up applying the concept to more realistic and complex problems. Presenting it while also teaching computer graphics application concepts might end up making polymorphism seem more complex and obscure than what it actually is, unless the student has already been extensively exposed to the graphics techniques that are being used. I do believe that a clear, immediate, simple even if a bit primitive grasp on a concept is key to fully internalizing it.<br />I also think that using an established and powerful graphics library like OpenGL would have made the computer graphics section much more fascinating and useful.<br />What else to say, do yourself a favor and read this book. It has something to tell you, even if you are an expert programmer.<br />And.. ah yes, thanks Bjarne.sefulness at first, but I think this fault is inevitably and gradually eliminated later on when the students end up applying the concept to more realistic and complex problems.

B002GJU54E|4.0|Stephanie Plum gets more than she bargains for with the latest crop of bond-jumpers she's assigned to track down. First, there's the man in the produce wholesaler who bombards her with tomatoes. Then there's the guy who opens fire when she knocks on his door. But the one she needs most, the one worth the biggest fee, is a scientist who flipped out and assaulted his boss. Stephanie isn't sure where to begin with this case, but she's sure things have gone badly wrong when super-hero Diesel makes himself at home in her apartment and in her bed.<br /><br />Stephanie already has her hands full with boyfriend Morelli and alternate live interest, super-hunk Ranger. Diesel is trouble, but there doesn't seem to be any keeping him out. And Diesel believes that her target is behind a mysterious plan to take control of weather and blackmail the planet. Another super-hero type, Wulf, seems to have hooked up with the scientist and Wulf has a distinctive way about him, including his signature way of killing. Stephanie is pretty sure she doesn't want to end up dead like the scientist's ex-boss.<br /><br />Author Janet Evanovich seems to use these 'between the numbers' Stephanie Plum novels to play around with ideas a bit too outrageous to be included in the main line (and considering how outrageous the Numbers books are, that's saying a lot.) PLUM SPOOKY follows this trend, with cameo appearances from the Easter Bunny (retired) and a man whose farts set fire to furniture and trailers.<br /><br />Okay, this isn't great literature. Still, if you're looking for a shot of Stephanie, if you want to see her bumble her way through more captures, if you laugh at Lula, if you want to know the latest on the Tank/Lula saga (major developments here), or if you just want to decompress a bit, you won't go wrong with this one. I didn't end up laughing out loud the way I did with some of the early Stephanie stories, but I definitely got a smile on my face.
B002IM49IW|5.0|This could be the OG Cult-Classic movie.  Written and directed by Tod Browning who actually worked in a sideshow as a teenager.  The movie centers around the owner and operator of the show Hans who is going to come into a large inheritance.  Hans is a \\"little person\\".  Cleopatra is a trapeze swinger who is involved with Hercules, \\"The Strongman\\" and the two hatch a plan to get Hans' money.  Since Hans is attracted to Cleopatra, she is going to seduce him into marriage and then poisen him.<br /><br />Everything is going accordingly until Cleopatra loses it and \\"Freaks\\" out at her wedding reception and the other members of the sideshow get suspicious of her sincerity.  The movie unfolds and the ending is quite disturbing.  The amazing thing about this movie is that all the characters are REAL.  Back in the day there was no CGI so Browning had to go with the authentic thing.  Also, as a director, he wanted the film to be shocking so the use of real freaks was necessary.  The film was so shocking for the time that it was banned in some theaters.<br /><br />As a Cult-Classic, this is an A+++++ and a must own...
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I hardly ever write reviews but I felt like I had to for this album because I see some people trashing it. I've been a Paramore fan since \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" and I can honestly say that Paramore has come far. If you loved \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" and \\"Riot!\\", then you will love \\"Brand New Eyes\\". It's probably not what Paramore fans would expect. But don't worry that's not a bad thing. \\"Brand New Eyes\\" is more adult. Lyrically it's more mature and the music has got more of a darker edge to it. The first single \\"Ignorance\\" speaks for the entire record. Some people think it's a step down from their first 2 albums but I highly disagree. All in all it's a beautifully written record. It's hard to pick a favorite song from this album but right now \\"The Only Exception\\" is my favorite. Any true hardcore Paramore fan will love it just as much as the last 2 Paramore records.
B002QNGKGW|4.0|Editing is not that bad to really give the low ranking as per some previous reviews. Or maybe it has ben improved...    Not the best episode - but still a lot better than many other shows.
0140288503|5.0|Probably one of my favorite books of all time. I could not believe anyone rated this book 1 star so I began looking all those reviews. Every single one had the same thing to say. \\"i hated this book, it is too straight forward and there is no look into the political and social reason for the fight and no look into Somalian life style.\\" This does not mean the book is a one star book, it means you lacked the ability to read anything about the book before you actually read it. It was not written to tell you about those things, it clearly states that the book was written to get an in depth look at the fight itself and what went on DURING the fight and it does an excellent job at that.
B001IUBZAU|5.0|rumored to be their final album, if it is might as well go out on top.don't pay attantion to negative reviews. most are from people that don't like the wal-mart connection. wal-mart connection sold 3 million copies and became a supprise hit.listen to the album and decide for yourself.highlights being Rock and roll train, Skies On Fire, Anything Goes, Rock N Roll Dream, Stormy May Day, She Likes Rock N Roll, Money Made, Big Jack and War Machine.

B002HNA95E|5.0|This 2cd set is a must-have.  I don't know who would buy the single disc, which just scratches the surface.    Warner Bros. should have made a box set for this woman, who made a LOT of money for them during the past 25 years.    Of course, there is much complaining about what was left off, and truthfully it would take at least 3 cds to get all her Top 40 hits on there.    But look at what we've got--these songs sound so fresh in their newly remastered state.  She crammed as much as she could from the 80s, 90s, and 00s--and remember her peak years were the 80s, not this decade (which is well represented).    Only 3 ballads are included--this is truly a celebration of dance/pop.    The 2 new tracks-- \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" are awesome.    Madonna's contributions to music and pop culture are rivaled only by Elvis Presley and The Beatles.    This music is the soundtrack of my generation.    A true celebration!

B002JM1VJG|5.0|This 2dvd set is a thrill to watch, especially for anyone of the MTV generation.  It's a chronological walk down memory lane, filled with fabulous moments from the 1st Queen of Video.    My only complaint is that she didn't include ALL her videos, but there are so many here that haven't been seen since the 80s.    Madonna's great career of hit songs are accompanied by her beautiful avant garde videos.    This is a collection to celebrate!
