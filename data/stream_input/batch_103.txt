B00II5YD4S|4|Works great but I should have ordered one with a handle.
B000CO7IDQ|5|Excellent
B00BYH6C1E|4|REAL GOOD ITEM
B00HM295LE|5|Easy to install, and look awesome on my 2008 GMC Sierra crew cab!
B0093QLAGK|5|Fit perfectly. Easy to install.
B001AXGT7O|5|easy attachment and does a good job of supporting the motor. Appears very well built should last longer than the trailer from the appearance of it.
B00DKMZ834|5|Great fit and super bright for my 12V converted 1960 cycle ...hope it lasts awhile!
B00EDFM6R8|5|Purchased these LED light bulbs to replace some of the installed overhead lights in our 24-foot Class C RV.  They worked great!  We were looking for an LED soft white option in the RV, none of those blue lights or &#34;natural&#34; white LED's would be acceptable.  Compared to the standard soft white incandescent bulbs we had, these were a tad more &#34;white&#34; than those, but not very far off from the original soft white bulb color.  They put off plenty of light compared to the incandescent bulbs we had and with the reduced power draw from our house batteries, this was a double win on our part.  The price was great and we are very happy with this product!!!
B004TT1FXY|5|Easy to install. It comes with the bulbs, and it looks great.
B007EA528O|5|excellent quality fit and finish.. quick delivery, actually like the looks of it on car !!
B006U3R83I|5|good as gmc .
B0049YTKFY|5|Installed on my 2004 Crown Vic LX. I replaced the blower at the same time, but it was this that did the trick. Getting the old one out and putting this one in was about 30 minutes of frustration, it's like some kind of 3D puzzle. Make sure you have a second person to help holding hoses out of the way and take your time.
B00FPL10WQ|1|The device broke down about four months after purchase. It worked well just enough time to go beyond warranty period (1 month). Very disappointing experience. I Will never buy products from Dorman again.
B0085IJZ6E|5|Fit perfect and was very easy to install.
B005PZMLDY|1|It lists that it will work for a 2002 Buick lasaber but it dose not work. The front driver seat has the arm rest attached to it. So it dose not first the driver seat
B002NEUOGG|1|The first time I put them on one of the pins came out. I hammered it back in and welded it to the back with my TIG machine. Now it's a great tool. Very disappointed they broke on the 1st use.
B000IE0EZO|5|Very good
B00290CBGA|4|As long as you read the directions on the label this works great, and is much cheaper than buying the smoked lenses.
B00BNX88ZW|5|Installed into my 2011 Honda CR-V without a hitch.
B0006JLU1I|5|Nice, white covers again!  The installation was a lot easier than I thought it would be.  Perfect fit.  I plan to order an extra just to keep in the camper in case of emergency with so many campgrounds having tree branches that extend out over the roadways, wouldn't be too tough to break one of my older covers after it's been in the sun for several years.  It's about a 5 minute fix if you have the cover available.  Need some needle nose pliers to bend the little tabs to remove the old cover from the hinge and then secure the new one, and a square drive and Philips screw driver to undo the crank parts and reassemble.
B0085FON46|3|As time goes by, the flaws come to light. The welding isnt that great. I have some small holes that let exhaust escape
B00OQX7KQY|5|Best bang for the buck.
B002M1C3LY|3|I read the reviews about this not being the sensor shown so I ordered it through Summit Racing instead. It was drop-shipped directly from Delphi. The one I got was the black large-barrel sensor shown in the picture which mimics the original black Ford sensor better than the gray replacement sensor. The gray sensor works but isn't the best as it has an off-center and smaller magnet. Order ELSEWHERE if you want the pictured sensor.
B00GX4Y9AY|4|Compact and ready to jump start your can or charge your phone, computer etc
B004KANFL2|5|Shipped faster than the original date . LookS and fits perfectly. 2014 r1
B004ETCSL2|1|It does not work when i walk in front of it. It does not show much light in my drive way. According to the pictures on the box it shows a lot of light. Not so. I tried adjusting high, low, right angle, left angle, and walk around but no luck. Now i just walk up to it and wave my hand until it comes on. Plus it does not stay on long.
B000COY3Z2|5|These plugs brought the engine back to life. Much better than AC Delco.
B005H7DRQA|5|Great stuff for tired older leather seating !
B002RCGVDO|4|There OK
B008GNG5LG|1|Those were not even close to what I needed. Had to throw it away,<br />The hun caps are much smaller
B007MVAVAY|3|after 7 months of usage, the shocks are losing their lift. What used to require force to close is now a easy touch and the trunk drops.
B001HJR9XE|4|thanks
B00PBO13KG|4|Lights shipped in a safe quick manner. No damage. Happy with the product.
B009PN2AZ6|4|The part worked fine, I can tell the difference the moment it was installed. I'm hoping it is durable but for now I rate it a 4 star.
B004I0YBAS|4|This kit was just what I needed and easy to install.  I should have replaced both light lenses, however.  The newer is lighter in color.  Not a glaring difference, but you can definitely tell the replaced lens is newer than the original.  Would order again!
B0015YLS1A|5|It was great that Amazon stocks this small part separately. This part often breaks in the flaring operation due to its small size. The price is good.<br />Thank you.
B00FOWSPPG|4|Great product. Well made.  .
B00563C6XK|1|Are these a joke? I spent $75 for them and the screw holes are too big for the screws and brackets! I can't even attach them!!! So pissed wasted a week painting them to match everything else and finally go to install and there's no way to install!!
B00MG0P0PW|5|I love it.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Nothing beats this 20&#34; light bar, throws light in a pattern usable at night. While not as bright as a &#34;Ridgid Industries&#34; it will get the job done unless you are going 50+ MPH at night. Mounting uses plastic brakets but they've held up to some abuse, also no condensation to report. Been through plenty of rain and mud, but then again I am mostly in Arizona. Overall great lightbar but mounting brackets could use and upgrade.
B0002Z9NLU|5|Made it sound a little beefy i like it.
B001XUBAVO|5|fit perfectly and easy to install
B0085YBJ6C|5|Perfect for what we needed. My boyfriend has an 04 2500 cummins with a 6 inch suspension lift. The sway bar he had installed was rubbing hard on the springs and this was a quick and super easy fix.
B0012PM050|4|These are not as stiff as I hoped they would be but they do give a nice ride.
B005TKIK8K|5|Good quality ..for a sad loss of chance.diana b.
B00IEKP8VO|5|It fit  perfect  on my  ford expedition 2004 i definitely  recommend this product
B00IMUC9YA|5|Good quality. Fit my Ford Edge perfect & was easy to put on. Love the rhinestones, I wish that they laid flat, other than that it's a good buy.
B002SSDUOA|5|Timing Light and tachometer function worked well. A very good bargain.
B000FGKBU8|3|This is the second one of the LARGE levels with the metal ball in the tube (different manufacturers). They seem to have the tendency to stick with small/slow movements. Too frustrating for me. Think you're level, then come back or rock the camper and you're off. What good is it to see from the driver's seat if you have to get out and jump on the trailer, then start all over again? I ended up with a smaller one that only uses an air bubble. Glad I didn't drill the holes.
B00K7X8QWE|2|Not that good
B00CNEQZHS|5|Easy to install<br />Works great<br />No problems
B0097GSD5W|5|This item was as advertised. Dealer wanted over $700 for new one, was gonna get me one at cost of little over $400. I ordered this for my 2001 gl1800 and had dealer install it. They couldn't tell it from the original, except there was no numbers  stamped into it. Dealer warranty on theirs was 90 days on install and 1 year on part. So I have the same with unit bought here. Starter is strong, can't wait to get back on the road. Thanks!!!!
B00M2PS1RA|5|Just what I needed for my Honda Goldwing!  Doesn't take up much space in the saddlebag and works perfectly for topping off the tire pressure.  Hopefully, I will never need it to take care of a flat, but it is nice to know that it will handle the job if I ever do need to use it for that purpose.
B012FQM5CC|5|Very cool and is built good not junk like auto zone stuff
B00KF1IYPM|5|Awesome it looks Great on my MAZDA Tribute!!  I purchased the Black and White Version.
B009MVK0KI|4|Working well. No complaint
B00JXBAVBA|5|Good product,easy to install it.<br />I recommend it!
B000ET5264|3|I bought this at a local Target and I never liked it. The reason is: after checking one tire, if the next one is lower than the first one, it does not show the correct pressure. It shows higher pressure, though.  So, I needed to switch off each time to check each tire. That was a pain in the neck. Now, I misplaced it and I don't care, I don't miss it.  Not recommended.
B00BHNU6F8|5|GREAT FOR CLEMSON FAN.
B007FA1ZNE|5|Good product. Lights fast and burns clean.
B000W0RQ8C|3|The lock is the right size for my 2&#34; ball mount and trailer hitch receiver. Seems well built and strong enough. However, I'm having a difficult time locking and unlocking using the turn-key. I spend a few minutes each time trying to &#34;jiggle&#34; the key while pushing in and turning. Tried using some oil but that doesn't seem to work. Maybe I should've spent a little more and bought a better grade.
B007ZLO6B6|5|Great product
B00HZB8XYC|3|The quality of the sticker is cheaper than expected, but durable. It appears printed from someone's home printer or something, but it's still a really great logo.
B00H47INXS|5|Direct fit
B000EA5WLS|5|Very easy to apply and the instructions are clear. All items needed to repair come with it aside from a paper towel/cloth to clean excess residue. There are also helpful videos online if you need visuals to repair your windshield.<br /><br />For Example (what I watched for bullseye repair): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK1kpSZpMPM
B00BMF4G4S|1|Didn't have a good look on my metallic gray Z06. Seller also shipped two driver side door handles.
B00EAMBAAI|5|Absolutely perfect fit ,form , function
B000H94F6E|5|Worked great for my sports car keeping it charged during the winter using the trickle charge feature. Still use it for other thiings.
B00V5PMSX6|5|These work great on bike very comfortable.
B005ZZH7G0|5|all the transactions were good no problems
B00CEXKC2M|4|product is perfect condtion...fits perfect...beware...becarefull installing...get someone to help u fit this visor on both sides for perfect installation...do not bend material..prone to cracking ...do not bend when trying to reposition..
B0066SQN2Y|5|Perfect Fit! W140 1993 300se (s320) 3.2L
B01092IEEM|1|FIT VERY POOR,VERY THIN MATERIAL DO NOT WASTE TIME OR MONEY UNLESS CAR 50 YEARS OLD
B002GV7QOE|4|Works great love it. Just a pain to un tangle every use
B00WAX66Q2|3|Worked just like it was supposed to.  It just seemed a little pricey for what it is but got the job done cheaper than others I have seen
B00KTIUG5C|5|Very Easy to Program.  Now all family members have same access items
B007HS3GOK|5|We are pleased with our new awning. Easy to set up and great customer service when we had a question.
B006H34A8C|3|Purchased bracket to use in conjunction with Nightlite 7.5&#34; led light bar for a Suzuki z400.  Bracket installed easily however not until completed did I notice one of the arms was bent up and out. I had to gingerly finesse arm into level position.  Bracket comes with no instruction but is not difficult to figure out.  i will be buying one more of the light for my other quad but will save money and use angle iron instead this bracket.
B00I4D6SJ2|4|Unit functioned as described. Delivery, cost, quality were all excellent. We Like the machined aluminum rugged construction. Cable and plugs are good quality. Mounting bracket of stainless steel was simple to bolt on our electrical stand. Fit and finish very good. It functioned perfectly first time plugged in.
B00HNMLQAG|5|Great product!
B004OK77L2|5|This jack is awesome!  Lifts our camper with no problems. We love the quick release on it. Saves lots of time and money.
B0068FTIJU|5|It will fit the original D.I.D chain, bought it because the link that came with mine was a rivet type , and I don't have a riveting tool.<br />You will still need to have some sort of clamping tool to press the link plate , i just used the change breaking tool with shim on the other side of the link.
B00BF8N74C|5|Perfect fit and mounts with easy install for the 2012 Beetle.
B00D8BFJP4|4|Delivered very quickly - way faster than expected. Good image quality, my only drawback with this sticker is that it stretches. So, be careful during application.
B011ZHNVES|5|Not all cleaning and detailing towels are created equal, and this one is just perfect for my needs. Its great for both washing and drying the car, and I even use it for polishing my chrome sink fixtures in the kitchen as it makes the job super easy. Even better, this microfiber cloth is priced right - definitely recommend.
B001CUAYC6|4|Great starter kit for pin striping as it has the basic colors one would use to get started or add to their collection
B00D3YEGO6|5|Love this plate.  It is much more than what I expected, very sturdy.
B001V8UKBY|5|We had to use this recently, and it worked perfectly.  Was so glad we had it, made a bad situation a little easier.
B0083YDM00|5|Excellent item
B009GO6CYO|5|works as intended.  It is chinese, but for nearly the price of the hand crank that needed to be replaced, it was a great deal.
B00HCZFEUW|1|Bottom line is I would not buy these again.  They squeak when cold.  Have tried anti squeak spray on back of pads but that only worked for a couple of weeks.  If you want quiet brakes don't buy these
B0015MGB32|5|works perfect
B0019COQ6C|5|Good price and fast shipping
B00068XCQU|5|this is a nice item to have to charge the vehicle battery.  i use it on my harley. the connectorized end makes it easy to put on and off.
B0066S40T2|5|Perfect fit
B000CITTW0|4|While the product itself is solidly made, installation was incredibly frustrating.<br /><br />To help out anyone who just bought these great steps, I'll provide an accurate and clear installation procedure.<br /><br />1. Open the box and admire your new steps. They have a very nice heft to them and feel very sturdy.<br />2. Pay someone to install it for you unless you already own:<br />Assorted drill bits<br />Step drill bits<br />Safety goggles<br />Power drill(s)<br />Impact Drivers<br />Multiple wrenches of the same size<br />Car lift or &#62;18&#34; of ground clearance<br />Nut drivers<br /><br />-or-<br /><br />2. Briefly glance at the included instruction manual and find the position the brackets should be when installed<br />3. Throw away the manual, it won't help you any more.<br />4. Put down a tarp to catch all the metal shavings.<br />5. Have a helper mock up the position of your steps, and proceed to install the first bracket in a spot on your rocker panel that is flat and looks sturdy. This is where a step drill is better than a 5/8&#34; drill bit<br />6. Look up new and interesting curse words as hot shavings of metal land on your arms.<br />7. Check the bolt's fitment in the hole and ensure it lines up in the bracket. Redrill holes as needed<br />8. Measure 8 1/4&#34; from the center of the freshly drilled hole to wherever the other bracket is going to be mounted<br />9. Repeat steps 5-7<br />10. Drill and tap in the sheet metal screws. This is where the impact driver is very useful (I recommend the Milwaukee M18 Fuel impact driver).<br />11. Attach the step to the brackets and insert the bolts, hand tighten them.<br />12. If you can, use the impact driver to tighten the bolts. Otherwise, spend the next 30 minutes cursing as you look for a pair of 7/16&#34; wrenches.<br />13. Realize you have 1-3 more steps to install and cry.<br /><br />Other than the nightmare of an installation, these steps look and feel pretty good. I'm over 200 lbs and when stepping on them they have the tiniest give.
B001BWE9MG|5|Easy to mount and convenient to run the vent and fill hose together.
B00OXKR2MC|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B00R9VTG08|5|Looks good
B0049I6TJA|1|Got it December 22 2014 and now it stopped working.. Power is still going to it just quit.. Also starting to rust out already! Cheap!
B00B5RM3HA|5|Very well constructed and an extremely lightweight helmet.  I recommend having someone help measure your head to assure proper fit.
B004SNJPV0|5|Fixed the problem in a flash!
B0000B3ASK|5|Great product to deep clean your leather and tack
B002R0ALSW|1|This is bogus. You need to change the ad. This is just a lens not an assembly. Highly unsatisfied and plan on returning this
B007X7461W|5|so far so good, when the light is fully charged it is very bright I like the magnet base comes in handy often I just got to rember when shutting it off the push the switch twice to shut the little spot light off.
B000COX0JM|5|Seemed liked new
B000GVBMDC|3|It's not water proof at all.
B00QSN3OWE|4|A bit flimsy but overall I would say I am satisfied.  Instructions kind of wrong here and there. They could also include an extra screw.
B010E4ZVXM|4|works great, only thing I do not like is that it bounces a little bit in rough terrain.
B00IY3YLCI|5|Used as extra reverse lights on my 2011 F-150. Work GREAT! Extremely bright perfect size. As long as the winter doesn't destroy them.....highly recommend for the cost. Seems like good craftsmanship.
B00SDMJLQ6|5|This is EXACTLY what I needed! It fits perfectly in either front seat of a 2004 GMC Canyon. I have used it on a 2000-mile road trip with no problems. Very easy to install or move, and seems durable.
B006CN9FNM|5|As described, good price
B000C59ZDQ|5|Great price great product
B00I9JC3N6|2|Did not fit the cup holder of our 2010 Nissan Frontier - too small.  Its a somewhat sturdy plastic but not compatible near the shifter.  Even if it did fit, adjust ability is limited and restrictive.
B000BYENJO|3|3 out of 4 spark plug wires are good but one is useless.  It seems the steel part inside the rubber boot is too far down and does not make contact with the spark plug.  I had to re-use one of the old wires.
B000EDUUG2|3|would somebody please invent a smaller telescoping broom for bitty motor homes, and while they are at it, please create a clip holder that can be easily removed like a command hook?  his is the only broom that i could find, and i certainly looked for a more stable alternative.
B00KJ8C1AK|5|easy to install perfect height
B00NN85SH6|1|Doesn't work
B000H8U37K|4|It arrived quickly and fit perfectly except for the screws, I went ahead & used the old ones.  Works wonderfully so far!
B00ENTYLGI|1|One arrived broken, looked & felt very cheaply made. Glad I reutrned.
B007FISZKW|5|They came on time as promised. Great looking product.
B0096DW4C4|4|Worked well for me.
B004RCOUP8|5|Well made part, definitely worthwhile using one of these to protect your hose.
B00SQYE5NK|4|Pretty good.
B00EECM5FI|4|Has only been installed for a week but so far I'm liking it a lot. Bought to replace OEM bulb that finally blew on my 07 that just turned 100,000 miles. Color temp matches original and bulb was easy to install.  Would buy this item again if ever needed provided it lasts for a bit.
B00MP05O22|5|I used them as additional back up lights and use a switch to turn them on when I need them like in hitching up.  These are SUPER BRIGHT!!!!!
B00T8Q7TVU|5|Works perfectly as a Smoke tint alternative face shield for the Fuel Helmets SH-FF0016 Full Face Helmet (http://smile.amazon.com/Fuel-Helmets-SH-FF0015-Helmet-Medium/dp/B00843V6KI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1439516721&sr=8-1&keywords=fuel+helmets+sh-ff0015+full+face+helmet). The manufacturer of this helmet series no longer offers replacement parts, so as far as I know, this is the only thing on the internet that I have found that is fully interchangeable with the standard clear shield. Easy interchange interface and extremely durable.
B00AK00TI8|5|EVEN WITH ALL THE HUSTLE AND HECTIC PACE OF E-RETAIL, THIS WENT WELL, THANKS
B00OYUZD2W|1|Ordered a set... Good deal, until they arrive and are two different lengths.. WHOOPS... Now I have one brand new cable and one old cable (luckily, ONE of the cables matched my old one... )  PISSED OFF
B00DBEO8Q4|2|The brightness to these are actually very dim.  They don't put out as much light as I hoped they would.  They work just fine and do the job, but it's at a mediocre level.
B00DFPAZY8|5|Looked good
B004ZF3YD6|5|Ohhhh so bright!!!
B00ENLN14E|4|I like it because it fits well and is aesy to install, but, is very fragile, for a very overwgeiht person not recommed
B0068O9210|5|Fit '01 GasGas EC 300 just fine.
B0002261ZO|5|Excellent product.  Seapower Inflatable boat cleaner does exactly what it claims to do.  It took my older 1989 Achilles inflatable and made it look almost new.  My boat is Red and it REALLY made a difference in appearance.  It not only removed years of old oxidized film from the surface of the inflatables fabric, but cleaned it and gave a like new luster and shine, without making it looks like it was covered in a cheesy dressing.  You can see in the photos that the &#34;before' photo shows pink-ish oxidized, chalky fabric, but the &#34;after' looks clean, shiny and oxidation free.  I highly recommend this product.
B000EVYGQY|2|will not clear abs code.as stated it would
B00WHKNZ2Q|5|Came in quickly and mounted just like original equipment. Excellent quality for inexpensive cost!
B000EDMX8K|5|My grandsons will love them a good size great colors .
B0041S1OUM|2|Buyer beware.....I used this grease on a gear replacement in a KitchenAid mixer a couple years ago and the consistency looked good. My wife recently stripped another gear and upon disassembly I noted that all the grease had broken down and simply flowed into every crack and crevice leaving the gear box dry. We are not heavy users of the mixer, but it does get used for cookies and rolls and the like. I decided to use food grade grease form Amsoil (ordered it from www.amsoil.com). We'll see if that holds up better.
B00853KY8C|5|nice
B00E9HWS9G|4|Did come with the chemical smell others have mentioned but nothing that wasn't taken care of with a couple days airing out in the garage.  They are fairly thick and easy to roll up if need be.  Cut fairly easily with a decent pair of scissors or box cutter.<br /><br />One word of warning on trimming.  Be sure all your cuts are curved and do not come to a point / corner.  Once the mat has a strait cut it is easy for that cut to continue.  Once you have a cut started you can actually just rip the mat by hand.  If your cut is curved it is very hard to tear the mat by hand.<br /><br />I would still suggest Weathertech over these but if you don't want to spend that much money or looking for something a little less permanent these will certainly do the job.
B000GU0MMU|4|you have to pump many times to get out the oil but it works!
B00L1M7I1A|2|Jug was warped, head studs bent and one had bad threads. Head gasket extremely flimsy
B00M0EJKOG|2|It came on time and was very good until about more than 1 month in of use.  Then the plastic flower patterns started to peel off all over the ring without my hands rubbing on those area.  Too late to return and now I need to find another cover.
B007PP26RI|3|worked great!
B00TT6IBSY|5|This is a sweet looking bumper sticker!
B00GR2W0PI|5|SUPER FAST SHIPPING&#62;&#62;THANKS love my fellow vets
B00ATXEPQI|5|love this charger.  like that i can charge multiple things at once instead of one at a time esp for road trips
B00HS0YABA|5|A quality replacement for a great price. I didn't realize how worn out the struts were until the test drive after I replaced them.
B007P72IW4|5|Worked great.
B003332KBS|4|Fantastic product - very pleased!!
B000BKEBOU|3|I applied this putty exactly as the instructions said to. The putty joint cracked the next day. I am going to apply a thicker coat and see if that makes a difference. Harold
B00FDW57VC|5|Perfect match. Will buy other needed parts for my Chrysler from this vendor.
B0006IX7Y2|4|Works well and stores well.
B0042KJV9U|4|it does what what it says
B004BTEZPM|5|worked without issue, a bargain at this price
B000637TNM|5|great results, thanks, Car leather looks much more rich color.<br /><br />thanks
B00PCV1X7G|5|It is exactly as described.
B005CERD9K|5|This is a good antenna delete . It matches my hood and hatch.
B0002UEN1U|4|Works well. I just hate waiting the 24hrs that it takes to cure before returning a vehicle to service
B008OXJIGW|5|I needed a basic emergency tool set for my bike and this fit perfectly in my CB1100's storage space.<br /><br />Would recommend.
B0019UNGWO|5|This keychain is very useful for my Cadillac remote
B000C5SGBI|1|Did not fit 2004 subaru legacy L 35th Anniversary, different connector type.
B001AY2WLU|5|Just loved it!!!
B000BUQODG|5|Great product at a great price.  The first one was a little hard to install but the second two took about 15 minutes each.  The first night after I installed these there was a huge storm and not a drop of rain leaked through.
B00NFFPUKC|4|These are excellent quality, keychain/wrench is a nice extra.  A bit pricey, though.
B005TIV16K|5|Just what I needed. Easy to install by myself, had to read instructions a couple of times and study photos but all went well.
B00P8FBG4G|4|I have to say that I did like the product. Although I used my own sandpaper on air tools, the Ace Cleaner, Hyper Shine worked great without me having to polish the headlights.  I could have used more of the Nano Sealant.  If you sold a box of 50-100 packages of the Ace Cleaner and Hyper Shine I would probably just purchase those in bulk.
B007TGKECC|5|Good fitment
B0036GM382|3|It is probably OK, but my Can Am Spyder did not like it. Caused a VSS computer error code.
B002N2T3OM|5|even if you are a diy oil change guy this just makes things so much easier. no spills no mess and its built to last unlike those cheap plastic ones. Spend the extra money its worth it.
B005XBG6HW|5|Fits as stated.
B00HGIJ74Y|5|Cool decal.
B00VJV5LRG|5|not much to say, works good on rx7 header
B000BO7CVK|5|Good stuff excellent!!!
B00NFSNAS8|5|works like a charm
B00QU7BV1E|5|Bought one of these.. It didn't fit my car... Note: I bought it knowing that though. I have a 2000 Honda Accord v6 auto and this thing wasnt even close to fitting. But after some fabrication to the Ebrake handle and the cover aka the piece I bought, it worked with some hammer hits. Now why am I writing this you ask? Because this thing is strong.. And very sturdy. I got it on there with little to no damage done to the product after I drilled it out more and cut some threading. Outside looks brand new. But, please measure before buying. And if you bought it to experiment like me, well.. Goodluck. Took me two hours. Looks amazing in my car though!
B003RVUYJG|5|Bottons are hard to press but that could be because its new
B000C9QU5I|5|spent the extra money for ACDelco, no problems, still quiet!
B00JMCCGDQ|5|Wonderful oil. Best I have ever used.
B00BITJZUI|2|It's an ok product, it did not match up in color to the other door handles.
B000ZART2M|5|I absolutely love my seat covers! This is the first time I have bought custom fit covers for my car (I recently bought a new one and want to maintain the inside.) They fit perfectly. I did have a bit of trouble with the head rest covers but the head rests in my car are shaped really weird so I have no doubt that is the reason. It was a two person job to put them in, but again that was my car and not the seat covers.
B000FOL08M|5|heavy duty bar excellent
B0002KKJWW|5|on time and perfect
B000C34KEW|5|Great product that one must buy if needed.
B00CEL47Q6|4|As others indicated it will install easily but will leave a very tiny gap but I don't care as it was not looking good with the missing part
B000IXRMSM|5|Great replacement for the original.
B0012UK3M2|3|The product seems very solid, high quality, and made in Germany but I have problem with its beam focus.  I thought the headlight might be needed to adjust to get the new bulb light in focus.  In cautious, I switched back the Philips OEM bulbs then I found the beam is back to its original setting and the fact is my OEM bulb is very dim already.  I really like the SYLVANIA bulbs with Germany made, but I can't see the light focus on the road in nighttime driving.  The bulb tube is kinda large comparing to the OEM that means more gas filling inside to help its life last longer.  Light color is good and not very yellow.  I hope SYLVANIA could improve its H4 bulb product in future but I have to return its product for now.
B000UVUAFO|3|This is a REAL review. I just purchased this product, Wal-Mart appears to be one of the only 24 hour establishments in Lansing to carry it. I have used this product before with great results. I purchased this to repair a deep scratch caused by someone keying the side of my car. This product works just fine for fine and medium scratches (which require a bit more time) but it will do NOTHING for deep scratches unless you first use a scratch repair pen, per the directions. I did not have time or money to buy and use one, mostly because my specific color was not available without ordering it online (Aquamarine Frost Metallic is a rare paint job on a 99 Ford ZX2), and it takes a week to set before you can proceed with the kit. It cleaned the scratch and covered it up partially in a couple places, but mostly it is still visible.<br /><br />If you follow the directions and purchase the extra pen it should also work well for deep scratches. Note that using this to remove anything besides fine scratches doesn't actually remove the scratch. It merely covers it up, like makeup. The scratch is still there, it depends on what angle you happen to look at the area and also how far away you are.<br /><br />I know nothing of washing a car after using this and having the scratches return, as in some other reviews, but then as I have said, you can't count on this removing the scratch completely.
B005RJ3GBE|5|Worked perfectly, easy to replace and extremely cheap. Well worth it.
B00BGZ1MMI|5|Arrived before the estimated date, which I was happy about. It fit perfectly on my remote. It's neat fitting and it's pretty. I'm very happy with my purchase. Will recommend.
B00RE6KV48|5|I was quite pleased with this leather conditioner. It came in a small ziploc bag with a seal on the opening. The liquid is clear and has the consistency of an oil. I liked that it was not too runny or too thick, which made it very easy to apply. It is all natural, non-toxic, and contains no harsh chemicals, which I appreciate. It also has no artificial smells, so the conditioner has no strong chemical odor, fake lemon scent, etc., or offending smell. If you are sensitive to the smell of chemicals or fragrances, this would be a great product for you! To me, it smells like a blend of neutral oils. I let someone else smell it and they said it reminded them of the smell of play doh. In any case, the smell is rather faint and does not overpower or linger. I for one, love knowing that I am putting something natural, safe, and non-toxic on my treasured leather items, and that the liquid goes on clear. Also, it can treat a broad range of leathers: treated, untreated, exotic, and even faux! However, since it may temporarily darken lighter leathers, and you never know what may happen, I would always recommend doing a spot test first to be safe!<br /><br />I tried it on the treated leather of my car, and while you can't tell in the photos, the leather feels more supple and moisturized, which is great to maintain the leather and prevent it from cracking. After cleaning the leather and allowing it to dry (the company recommends warm water and mild soap), I put a bit of the conditioner on a microfiber sponge and applied it evenly. I gave it 1 hour to dry and wiped off the excess. Even before wiping, my seats absorbed the conditioner very well and it didn't feel greasy, sticky, or oily. It was a cinch to wipe off and it didn't transfer onto my clothes when I drove immediately after. I am excited to try the conditioner on other leather items and will update my review if I experience any issues.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Thanks for reading and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have!review. Thanks for reading and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have!
B00V6464MW|5|Just what I needed.
B00YI3IGA6|5|This is the only product that covers the entire window. Wish I had it sooner!
B001XU25LI|1|Not what it is advertised to be used for. Not better than any ordinary car wash soap....<br /><br />I had better luck with just using regular soap and adding a little of simple green to the mix.
B00K3GBRQ2|3|It is brighter than stock, but I do not think they 800 lumens each bulb as advertise.
B00MP14634|5|Great look, great fit, comfortable and a great price!
B00FRHOGU6|5|It works very well for me and fit my car ford EDGE 2011. Thank you!
B00195CKQC|4|Looks great. Good quality
B004P0K1GY|5|Fit perfect and look good, can't complain.
B0026OOC5M|3|Returned not size.
B001EQN97K|5|Great gloves
B00HQZ9PVM|5|An easy replacement for an original Atwood that had outlived its life expectancy in our motorhome.
B00ZPQ41GI|1|It scratched the paint
B00U8695HK|3|Its been almost 3 weeks since I've had it plugged in. Its only one when im driving to work and back and on days off im still on the go with it plugged in, So with that said, I haven't noticed any difference of clean smell. The blue light distracts me because I think led lights are awesome, however the cigarette smell is still there. For a smoker like me to go inside and still smell the cigarette stinch means its probably not working.. yet.. hopefully. Not knocking on this product,  just saying there's no difference yet.
B000BO9TMU|5|very happy
B00MB0EXGE|2|Very pretty to fades almost instantly
B00BBW3YPO|5|Nice product. Fits like OEM should
B006TMKXUU|4|great
B009DJOWS0|5|perfect fit!
B00SBUTI9U|1|Incorrect and misleading description. Apparently the hardware is not included and unless you have high profile LEDs the license plate will block the dispersment of the lights. I'll give them one star for quick shipping.
B005C57EMK|3|Note that this top case matches all of the metallic black FJRs.  That includes the Canadian version of the 2014 FJR1300ES and the black version of both the US and Canadian 2015 models in addition to model years mentioned above.
B001C6NC7O|4|Great compression hose, use it with my Makita 700 compressor for nail finishes, critter spray painting, and general blow gun clean up around the garage. I give it 4/5 stars because I'm not 100% satisfied with the compressor ends since I feel that overturning or abuse to the end fittings can ruin the hose altogether with leaking. However it has held up so far and am happy with the durability and flexibility of the hose itself.
B000O7H8FE|5|works great.
B00IACGFOA|5|Primarily use it at a fixed RV site but it have used it at state parks as well.
B0055FE1VO|3|Difficult
B009D3FLIG|4|Matches pretty well.  We used it for paint chip rock dings on the front hood.  Fills are visible, but only if you look closely.
B00EXIEVO6|4|worked fine
B00K8HXGH4|5|Very pretty decal!
B005A8MNFC|4|easy install, very functional
B001DRL666|1|didnt work for my car
B00XPL88NC|5|After realizing that I couldn't trust the accuracy of a digital gauge I had received as a gift a few years ago, I began looking for a quality tire gauge, and decided on the TireTek.  I am very pleased!!!  It is easy to use, easy to read, and the chuck fits quickly on the valve stem without all that hissing loss of air that I used to hear.  I highly recommend the TireTek Flex-Pro Tire Pressure Gauge!!
B010RI973K|5|It changed the interior of my can , made it way brighter , so far it's been 2 weeks everything working well. Easy to install
B004O2ND54|1|Like other reviewers have written, this piece of junk does not come with the mounting hardware shown in the picture.  Sure, you can go to the hardware store and get hardware to do the job, but that's not really the point.<br /><br />Also mine came with the base plate bent.  The shipping box was not damaged, but the packing materials were sparse.  Overall, this looks like some kind of hack job.
B004G9VIXE|5|I replaced the lock actuator on the passenger sliding door of our 2007 Grand Caravan.  This part is interchangeable with either the left or right sliding door.  I ordered the part and was excited to finally repair the faulty lock mechanism.  However, when I installed the new part this did not repair my inoperative automatic lock.  This caused me to doubt my troubleshooting skills.  However, knowing the part would  fit either door I removed the door panel from the left (known good actuator) side.  I swapped out the new part with the known working part and low and behold the part I received from Amazon was defective.  I contacted Amazon via email and I notified them of the defective part.  I was offered a refund or replacement part.  I opted for the replacement part and Amazon sent the part out immediately.  I received the new part three days later and the replacement part fixed the faulty lock.  I am very pleased with the way Amazon handled my problem and even more pleased to check off one more item from the &#34;honey do list&#34;.
B00MJHKGQU|5|great sticker for the truck, hasnt faded all summer. I will be repurchasing.
B000COS06U|4|My husband was very excited that I found these online. We just bought a new truck and he was worried about hubcaps getting stolen (we live in a not so great neighborhood) He had no trouble putting them on, so far they seem to do the job.
B00M9NXUHG|4|I looked at this item for a few years before purchasing. It works very well. My complaint with it is the craftsmanship. The holes that are used to adjust the height were not drilled straight through. Because of that the pins that were sent with did not work. Luckily I had a small draw pin so I could use it.Also, make sure you have extra pins on hand, I lost 2. I purchased reciever hitch pins with the slide safety clip (they have worked the best and I did not lose those).<br /><br />Tony
B00G5OGTN2|5|Perfect fit
B00DQCR7NC|5|Excellent product fit perfectly on my 01 660 Raptor. I purchased this to keep my Stage 3- 686 bore Yamaha Raptor cool. Runs on race fuel so you can imagine the heat I create. Works perfect and fits perfect with no issues.
B00VN1YWI6|3|The hat looks great but its not the best quality. This hat came to me with stiching threads still hanging off of it. With a weak brim. Once I picked the threads off its a great hat
B005GX3GFW|3|This works as advertised, however I had to track down a thicker rubber strip to place between the clamp and the steering wheel (this is on a forklift which has a smaller steering wheel than most cars) as there is much room for adjustment.  It was also a bit of pain to install and get the right amount of play in the knob.
B008D30WCC|5|No issues with install Herat chrome great product highly recommen
B0007WLPA0|4|I wish the unit had tapered sides like the front of the unit.  As others have indicated the back corners protrude, doesn't allow for a sleek look.
B00JXZJLO4|5|Is working goog
B004HD0CTU|5|Super heavy duty, great locking mechanism.
B00R6HDFRA|5|Sturdy basket that fit perfectly and was easy to install!!
B009OEM40C|5|Perfect replacement
B00BE5IKUM|5|excellent locks.
B00CJ6JLV2|4|look great under the hood, Have had them on for about 4 months now, haven't had any issues. They a b****h to put on though.
B00A23V5EU|5|Just what the supplier listed.  Installation is very easy, but I have one question please.  Does this unit have to have it's own &#34;dryer&#34; as supplied, or can it be hooked up to the &#34;dual&#34; dryer&#34; that came original on my Tahoe?  It seems redundant to hook up to a new dryer when the original installation had a two port dryer installed.<br /><br />I think this part was replaced when someone hit that part of my car and body work had to be performed.  I found the old compressor hooked up to a separate dryer with the second port on the original not being utilized?????????
B006JRLIVS|5|Exactly what we needed. An easy DIY job with minimal tools. Be sure to get putty for sealing.
B002M4E8TG|5|fit perfect on my alt car
B00CHD8Y4C|5|Was hesitant buying a support that was like a quarter of the oem price but I'm glad to say that it went on smooth/easy and straightened the front end on my jetta so she looks brand new! just be careful tightening bolts because the inserts feel a little weak.
B001F0GZZ8|5|Cleans the white vinyl in our boat with not a lot of hard scrubbing.
B007MVAVAY|5|I'm impressed with these!  The seller was cool enough to email me an unsolicited link to their &#34;how-to&#34; video, which made installing them pretty obvious.  They work great and I recommend them.
B005HR2MXY|3|Works awesome but ugly with no phone in place.....
B001UOUMWQ|5|Perfect Fit on 2000 Pontiac Sunfire, easy installation if you know what you're doing.
B00RIVNP1K|5|The product fit my vehicle perfectly.
B0009NUG66|4|This came in very handy, saved a lot of room in the car
B0013LF3ES|5|good, just what my husband needed, thank you for fast shipping
B004940ZNK|5|Great replacement.Easy to install and works like original
B00KJO4198|5|Exactly as described, works great
B000E0Z6NM|4|This was great flush solvent, but it comes in an enormous can for a very limited amount of product. I could've ordered at least 4 cans of this for the flush job I was doing. Unfortunately I had to make due with what I could find locally to finish the job.
B00FKYS3PU|3|Would put more stars, but one less tie than needed to attatch, poor paint job on the filter. Other than that, it's good quality and what I needed to give that little extra horsepower.
B00IMK5T5Q|5|Great fit
B004HE565E|5|Good
B00GQFR1TQ|5|Works perfectly. I would purchase again. 100% satisfaction.
B0074FQKDA|5|Product worked perfectly and exceded my expectations based on the reviews I had read.
B0002U268M|4|It was highly recommended to me that I use this product after I buffed the haze off of my headlight lens covers.  This product was easy to apply and it seems to work as it was intended too.
B005334SDY|5|Excellent Prompt Delivery, Very Satisfied. AA++
B00E1QYJB0|5|Cute and suits my purpose perfectly.
B00TP3FXCS|5|Great product!
B008X033C6|4|Replaced both rear on a 1993 Honda Accord EX Coupe. Installed without any issues. I've owned this car for about 5 years and the struts I replaced were original so I don't know how it's supposed ride with new struts but I'm happy with the results. It handles much better. It's a little firm over bumps but no more than I expected for a car this size.
B00NFSNAS8|5|works perfectly.  replace one i had that broke and this is so much better as it has the 120V plug in option not just the cigarette lighter option.  plus nice having all the inflation attachments for the different items you blow up, balls, pool floats, tires..etc.
B004I8O7J0|5|Direct replacement. Easy to install. Fits like new but you may want to upgrade the bulbs via Amazon too. Could be a bit brighter.
B00B0C1RWM|5|Perfect fit , no problems with the install .what a great deal.
B00NEYOX2U|1|Terrible. They didn't even fit remotely close to my truck. Not impressed
B004LX3AXQ|4|Seems to do a good job but pretty slow for charging up a dead car battery. To be fair I am using it on an automotive 12V Bosch AGM battery Group Size 24 that is rated at 60Ah. I think it works well as a top up but takes a long time to do a full charge on a car battery...especially an AGM battery. It took +30 hours to go from 25% to fully 100% and optimized (solid green light). I am using it because my alternator is about dead and I am waiting for a day off to get it replaced with my mechanic.
B00HNDE10M|5|Actual detail as shown in the picture. Really stands out seems to be well made for a long lasting life
B00XCW9Q1C|5|Thanks!
B00AR15MFK|5|These cables are the perfect length. I used them to jump my GMC truck the other day. I was headed in to a parking space with no way to pull a car in next to me, these cables were able to reach all the way to the back of my truck to the jumper car. Saved me! The cables are flexible while being heavy duty at the same time. The case is nice because it keeps them neatly folded and tucked away so as not to snag on other items.
B000IBEOQ2|5|Worked as expected - instructions are clear, even though the process is somewhat messy and complex
B00BZSDWFQ|3|not a great fit but it serves the purpose.
B001JT3HNI|5|Nice and bright
B001MU5JOE|5|Great price and quick shipping
B003TTL0TE|5|Great product. When this goes bad I will definitely buy again!
B00C59RT1C|1|THIS FUEL PUMP LASTED LESS THAN 6 HRS. I  HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET IT REPLACE OR MY MONEY RETURNED \. I HAVE NOT BEEEN ABLE TO FIND A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL YOU TO GET THIS DONE.
B002OUPFOU|5|Easy install.
B00CMX20H4|4|This is a decent Horn, its big though...you must buy something like the Deluxe Wiring Kit for Stebel Nautilus Compact Air Horns<br />Sold by: BikerHiway $15.00, unless you want to go buy some wire and connectors and relay separately.<br /><br />I put this on a 2012 Harley Davidson Heritage Soft tail Classic.<br /><br />The mount sucks, had to fabricate a bracket to mount this to where my existing horn was. this took more time than anything else,<br />Using the wiring kit, which had the relay and all the wires and connectors, see my comments there about the kits, it doesn't have extra connectors, so if you screw up you gotta head to the store.<br /><br />But once i had the mount ready it took less than 30 mins to wire, only had to take off my seat to get to the battery area, relay and fuse from the kit fits under the seat just fine.<br />Fished the wires through the existing conduit under my tank. Kits wires are long enough to run from the horn to the battery area.<br /><br />One thing though... on your old horn make the cuts right at the horn, you will need your old wires, they connect to the relay that comes in the kit. had to splice a white wire from the kit to the black wire of my old horn, this was the wire that came from the horn button. but the kit came with connectors to do this. so it worked fine.<br /><br />The diagram is pretty crappy on how to wire.. but there is a lot out on google, its not hard.<br />Wouldn't recommend for anyone who has never worked with wiring electric items though.
B00H1IGBOS|5|Great! Fit perfect and shipped quick.
B005GQ97AC|5|useful
B00LXJTMRY|5|my daughter LOVES this
B00HRZVC6W|5|Best option for the price.
B00CB4YHO8|5|Easy installation. Exceeded expectations.
B005CJ30XI|5|must have on all dodges
B000VKRQB0|5|Very easy to install and fits perfectly in my 2001 Volvo S40.
B0002JMIEK|5|Great product but the price just doubled to 36 dollars. Lucky I cashed in early.
B00NIFD17S|4|I bought these for occasional use and wanted a less expensive alternative to OEM roof cross bars.  They were easy to assemble, adjust, and install on my existing side rails.  The rubber rail inserts aren't quite long enough to make it the full length of the rail and this creates a whistle under some driving conditions.  On the whole quite satisfied.
B0022ZTBHY|5|They worked great
B00PO1P686|5|...In front of the passenger, not next to them.  Installed like a charm in less than ten min, & looks fantastic!  Holding up against my two kids as well.
B00ARUSWMG|5|Easy installation got it done in less than 15 min. Fits my 2003 Civic like the original.
B00IIWD0M2|3|For the cost and supposedly elite, they squeek at low speed.
B0085IJXCU|5|Worked without issue, I did have to drill out my hole. The fan motor shaft is so small and there is no numbers so I guessed and went with the same one figuring I could drill it out, which I had t do. The new blade is quite. Also note if you can or have time, remove old blade before ordering. the original was a D shaft but the round worked.
B00SS3J3PO|5|cute - my daughter loves it
B0016IX9VC|5|great deal fast service
B00NF17NRE|5|The product was an exact fit for my 2006 Pontiac torrent . I had my front hub replaced while on vacation in North Carolina, and apparently the mechanic only snugged the caliper mount bolts. A week  after  returning home the cars front end was making a loud metallic clunk and had bad braking. After a thorough inspection I found one caliper mounting bolt missing from driver side. I went to all the local auto parts stores and no one had or could not order them.  I went on Amazon to see if they were listed and as always the part was available. Had them in a few days and car was good as new.
B00864OBGQ|5|great for the price.
B0000AZ9KS|5|I had one previously from the &#34;harbor&#34; store, but this one is much better - more sturdy, and well built. I saw some post concerns about difficulty with its operation, but it seemed to work fine for me. I'll be buying another one.
B00B1RNLFM|5|Best Price I could find on the net. Paired with my Amazon prime two day shipping. Great Item!
B00F8LEB9W|2|it says a pair not just one does me no good when you got to have 2 to program it to your car 98 ford mustang and it didn't come the 7th it came the 8th they should say one not a pair that's false advertisement
B002YPHT76|5|item exactly as described. quality higher than expected from price. i think this is a &#34;smoking deal!&#34;
B003HB29NA|5|Packaged well, fair price, easy to install, looked great on car.
B008336W08|5|Works great for day and night riding
B00ZJ6TOZC|3|Products seem to be OK but it was a day late On shipping!  Timing is everything !!<br /> As far as the product I can't really comment on the quality until we use them for a while. Good news is they do work
B0024E6UE0|4|work great. Makes you wonder why this is an aftermarket item and not standard on RV mfg.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Love it!
B00032KBFE|5|I think these work great, once you get them started.  The bolts I got do NOT taper at the end, so it's a bit of work to get them started.  I used a compatible security bit, so I had a lot more leverage with a full handle screwdriver.  I think it would have been frustrating to get the bolts started with the included tool.  It's just too small for that.<br /><br />I chose to remove the old plastic &#34;nuts&#34; and use the ones in the kit.  They fit the standard cut outs on both cars I used them on, but they do fit quite tight.  That does make them that much more secure, though.
B001CF3KBI|5|They are exactly what I wanted and completed my FJ for Wisconsin weather!  Mechanic that put them on said these were great!
B00170MW8K|5|Just perfect for my jimmy
B0002STS4E|4|A good quality tool for pulling stubborn plug boots in the tight confines of engines still using plug-wires.  Prevents you from yanking the wire off the connector/boot/plug.
B0083LEZYA|5|This oil drip tray great.  The right size to catch any stray oil from landing on the driveway and it is easy to clean.
B000C7ZUF6|2|Worked fine for about 3-4 weeks. I was told for some reason when it comes to this product the aftermarket stuff does not seem to hold up.
B0063CU52M|5|ACCURATE AND FAST DELEIVERY
B00MJC82AW|5|OEM Quality and perfect fit.
B000C11PYW|2|This did not work as expected, so I went to store to buy fix-a-flat, now I have a spare fix-a-flat with me at all times, works better than this for cars. I do have this for my bike though
B00QMU0JB2|5|Work great, easy to apply
B000TDT8II|3|Can't really give it an honest review. I have a center console with a t-top and there was no way to attach it. Amazon made the return a breeze. For what it's worth it seemed well constructed.
B007Y2SIGK|3|Easy hookup in my 2008 MKX.  A very low stress way to wire.  The connectors that go between the lights and the harness are very cheap and brittle, though.
B000B5ZM6Q|5|wonderful is all I can say.
B00JK020H2|5|Great projection distance. Use these for reverse lights on my 14 f150. Only issue is that it doesn't project down and close to the bumper enough as I'd like. Not the products fault just keep in mind. It is really really bright though
B004O8SYDO|5|Exactly what I needed!
B004HOXKS4|5|Excellent build quality. Thank you.
B000E323BC|5|Works great!
B00KATZ0HY|5|Recived this with the two day shipping since I was compatible with Prime. It's very cute and the color matches in the photo. Instead of the company sticker you see the vw symbol along with the name underneath. It has a soft touch and it's a nice accessory to have. It will definitely do its job in protecting the key.
B000Q71N8K|3|works fine,now that we replaced the latch that was broken in shipping.
B005R27ZK4|2|It was thee wrong color
B0002UHVAA|5|Love this....I thought my black tank was empty, until I used this & all kinds of crap came out
B00UHD4HJA|5|Great quality stickers included a couple extra stickers worth every penny!!
B000FQ0FKO|5|Nice fan clutch, fit perfectly, replacing the OEM part on my 99Jeep Cherokee. I was having heat problems ( running warm off road). It seemed like the fan was always running and the aux electric fan was always on. I replaced bother the electric fan and the clutch on the belt run fan. Everything runs much better now. Less noise and cooler engine compartment.<br />Yes, I would recommend the fan clutch. Good quality, fit, and price. It did come with four new fan to clutch bolts , in case you were wondering.
B000KI55KW|5|Worked well, I was easily able to change the manual transmission fluid in my 2011 JK.
B006DYXZ86|1|These were the wrong size for my vehicle, send them back for a refund.
B006FUT09G|5|I used this product for the first time last weekend and I can honestly say it cleaned my windows beautifully. Anyone hesitant of purchasing shouldn't be this product works better than anything else I've used. Oh and it smells good too!
B00GIOMWDU|4|works well.  I didn't notice any new noise.  Daughter and I installed in about 15 mins.
B000EIH0TC|1|Product is already ripping at the seams at the zipper.  It did so after having it on for only 2 weeks.  I'd go with another product if I were you .
B0034RKNPS|5|This is the pressure bottle cap to use on the Ford 6.0 diesel.  The ratchet keeps Ford service people from cranking the cap down too tight.  Compared to a boil over, and EGR cooler failure, from a cap leak, replacing the cap each year is inexpensive insurance.
B00EPA7CZC|5|Nice n bright !!!  Clear daylight white. No bluish output

B004BCJJO6|5|Extremely pleased with the look of these headlights and it was very quick and simple install
B0059715BC|3|I am a fan of the 3M Scotchprint products.  I have put up 4 full sets of clear bra and numerous little pieces of CF wrap.<br />Pros:<br />The finishing quality of this CF pattern is second to none.  It stands out so well and the pattern is well defined especially under the sun.  Compared to those super-cheap version that I had used in the past, the adhesive is much stronger yet it would not leave residue after you pull it off.  It is easy to cut and stretch.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I have a hell of a time to wrap true 3-dimensional objects such as the side mirrors.  I don't care what youtube shows you (even by 3M themselves), there is NO WAY you can do the mirror housing perfectly.  The film has good property of recovering and stretching, but the recovers too well under heat when it tends to shrink back to original size (or smaller size). It might look perfect right after you did it, but after a day parking outside under the side, the edge started to shrink and fold with &#34;ears&#34;.  3M told you to pre-stretch the film before apply on mirror but still it's just B/S, it doesn't really work especially at the corners.  The adhesive is relatively strong, but not strong enough to hold the film in place to prevent shrinkage and folds like the clear bra does.<br /><br />Summary:<br />Perfect film for relatively flat surfaces like roof, hood, dash and other trim pieces w/ 2 dimensions, but not box-type object.
B00P4XTSPG|5|For 10.95 + free shipping this is the best deal unless you have amazon prime. I got it in a week very fast shipping, easy to install unless you don't know what your doing, don't lose any parts and put everything in its rightful spot and this part will work for you
B00BGZ13LI|5|I like this! super cute case for my car remote. still on there and still the same as when i bought it
B00FUNPBA6|5|Great for any Squatcher out there! Jeff Meldrum I'm looking at you!😆
B003OXGR1G|2|Mirror shaking while driving
B00K2QS40K|5|Loved it.
B00B2AF56Q|5|Great product . fast delivery looks great and easy to install. I installed it on my 2001 jeep gc Makes the steering stiff without that death wobble I recommended to anyone with a 4 inch lift
B00OBZ9H4A|5|Live these reflective stickers. Nice material not cheaply made. Will be ordering smaller ones for my helmet.
B007I6P26Q|4|Very Simple to set up and operate.  Has been in service for almost a year now with no issues.  Very small and weatherproof so installation was a breeze.
B00GKB7IVC|5|Nice
B008435XIY|2|It was not loud enough to be heard while I was riding my motorcycle.

B000IY41VW|5|perfect fit
B00PNE0RJ2|1|Junk, Frauds, Trash
B009LZUJRY|4|Good easy assembly
B00L7ZH48S|5|Works like champ. Good job!
B00YOCHRME|5|Do not just try to stick this item on. I used a hair dryer to heat it and it stayed on great! First I left the roll in the sun until it was very flexible ( be sure to unroll it into a single line or the 3m cover might come off allowing dirt and whatever onto the adhesive). Then peel and stick on about 1-2 inches. Hold it as the weight of the rest may want to pull it off. Then heat it with hair dryer and rub it while pushing. Then just cut it with scissors and your done! One speaker took about 10 minutes.
B00BZQR6MI|5|Got these in two days, very easy to install.  The description says they attach with two sided tape but they do not.  They use prongs that you bend around the plastic sill, only takes 5 minutes to install all 4.  Did I mention they look great.
B004OK5SCM|5|Worked perfect for my needs, solid & well built
B00LT4UPTW|4|Not a perfect fit on my 2007 Tank 150, but worked great after a little modification to the plastic near the base.
B003SOKEXI|5|Need to look at the new one to see how the old one needs to come out of the armrest. Nice to be able to control the mirrors from driver's seat.
B00CMVKAM8|2|This mount was incomplete upon delivery.  Opened the outer box that contained this mount SM5622 and mount SM5623.  The SM5623 box was sealed and the SM5622 seal was broken.  Upon inspection the mount was in the box but no bearing.  Had to return item.
B000AS1XYO|5|I have a 2005 sebring convertible with 97000 miles....keept gettin low oil pressure when running for an hour or so.  Added this oil and no more oil pressure light, also engine seems to run a bit smoother.  Seems to work well.
B0049NFDJW|4|Just ok ,,, I'm sure there not going last as long as the oem part.
B00PC0G07A|5|pretty good one
B00194A6QE|4|Boots fit a little loose easy fix with adding additional inner sole.  Ordered to size
B005VUPJP0|5|Perfect fit!
B010JRH4CK|5|this deflector fits perfectly on the 2014 prius.  can you make one for the 2014 prius V.
B002G29MOK|1|This is a piece of garbage.  My husband used this a few times and it is falling apart. It was expensive and certainly of poor quality for it to be ripping and falling apart.  Unfortunately, we are traveling and missed the very short timeline to return this crappy mit.
B009V04CEK|5|Awesome awesome. Thought my alarm was completely broke. But nope it was just the clicker. Works now.
B003UT3S6Q|5|Spray this on. Let is soak. Little bit of abrasion if needed. The only wheel cleaner you will ever need. Safe for pretty much any finish on any wheel. If you are into good smelling products because that somehow matters with how it works don't get this product. It does smell a little funky. If you are like most people and want to buy this as a wheel cleaner and not an air fresher for your dubs, buy this asap.
B004QMXTBU|5|Worked great
B000C5SFN2|1|This O2 sensor failed to operate properly. I got a code 422 which indicates the O2 sensor is bad after two days of operation, which means it was never good. After replacing it, the code went away. Unfortunately, I did not immediately install it when I received it from Amazon (over 30 days). Now, it is out of warranty.
B003EOZLEO|5|Looks and works amazing. Makes it so much easier for my kids to get in. Can't wait to try it out on the trails.  Well took it out on the trails down in Slade Kentucky and beat the living snot out of them and they held up! I slide down rocks and banged into rocks with them and besides putting a spray can of black paint to them afterwards they are good to go again!
B004QQ8SEY|2|Ok
B00FPNLDLW|2|Seriously disappointed in the quality.  Comfortable while it lasted but the mono-filiment used to lace beads together didn't last even 1 year.
B00JBI9SIW|5|Great Value
B00HS0NOQM|5|Very good quality parts
B003HB5WPW|5|Nice covers. Good quality. Satisfied for the price.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great on my Lexus.  Really blocks out our West Texas sun!!!
B001810SHA|5|Worked great and for a good price, can't beat it!
B009OBVS2K|5|Took off all the hard water spots from my windshield on my 2014 Rav4 where I couldn't see anything at night in the rain because it would just be a white blur. Now the wipers clean the water off with no problems and it's very clear to see. Anyone who gave this product a bad review obviously didn't use it correctly. I used a microfiber towel and some good elbow grease. Worked like a charm. Very excited that I can see at night again when it rains! BTW, I tried many other products on my windshield, even vinegar and nothing worked.
B0000ATZCZ|5|Great
B0002JM69W|1|This cushion began to unravel the first few days it was used.
B00FH8P1DG|1|Got my light only part lighted up waiting for problem to be resolved by company!
B004LWTHP2|1|This has nice indicators and features, but only lasted about 2 months -- it quit completely and I have been unable to revive it.
B00DDQ194Y|5|I bought these for my 2011 Charger. They were easy to install and fit perfectly.
B00XD5S574|5|We just absolutely  love this decal. My boys have one each on their trucks  and people ask them about it all the time. Would highly recommend the deer for the guys.
B00GWTAAIA|5|Works great!
B00W9ZCJVW|5|Got it installed and it works well.
B00IKKS4W8|5|Pleasant transaction excellant sale thank you
B00FAWKSYG|5|Bumper was great!!!  And just as described for  wheeler
B0030GBLRW|5|Excellent product.
B00NDJ6WOS|5|fast looks great
B00068XCQU|4|Very Reliable.  Keeps the battery fully charged and ready for the next demand. I have two of these units in constant use.
B004X70UXI|5|Very nice magnet.
B00DUS3EKC|3|Works fine, but was missing parts.  Had to wait several days for the company to get them to me due to it being a Friday afternoon when I discovered the problem.  Had to jump through hoops to prove I had bought this.  Pain.
B0010ED27I|5|This filter works great on my motor home.  Traveling around, you encounter all kinds of water.  Some just taste bad, some look bad and some have both problems.  This filter removes all of the problems associated with bad water.  It attachs easily to the water supply hose and requires no additional attention.  I highly recommend it to anyone with an RV.
B000C83SRC|2|I Order The Wrong Ones. OH WELL.
B00651CIGM|5|Works great, and screwing it in was no problem. Just threw away the other adapters that came with. Perfect low profile antenna to use with AEV type snorkels on the Jeep Wrangler!
B00FDQPCR2|4|Item was as described & in good condition. Light is a little dimmer than I thought it would be .
B002UJVNFA|5|Comfortable, good quality for how cheap they are. Definitely a good buy.
B004RCSVVM|4|A little thinner material than I expected.  Easy to install. Took longer to get old screws and material out than it did to install the new fabric
B000182EZK|5|This was ordered for another Jeep we just purchased. We have on our other Jeep and are very happy with it
B000EA5WLS|5|Awesome product works great.. Just need to take your time to do it right.
B000MU8XI4|5|Worked perfect for our motorcycle, high quality. We even ran it through other bikes too while traveling.
B00U3XL2P6|5|I ordered a C110 reader that claimed it would work with my BMW328i which had Brake, ABS, DTC, Airbag lights come on all at the same time. The C110 was unable to read or clear the codes. The CRP123 was able to read all codes, tell me exactly which wheel speed sensor was out and clear the codes after it was replaced. Worth every penny!
B004Q1Z8JM|4|Great product
B0006GF5SK|5|Always works the best love this item
B00HT5M5E8|5|Every bit as good as advertised.  I really like the fact that the tube is completely sealed and so no moisture or dirt can get inside the tube.  The perfect step bar for my 2500 HD Chevy truck.
B00JFSI3RK|5|got the job done....at a really good price. thanks.
B00HVHG0VI|5|the key to my van cost a lot of money to replace, so putting this cover on it saves it from all the drops it may get.
B0040CW0PM|1|The product was good priced and arrived fast, just wouldn't work for my Scion XD inner fender!
B002RNB70A|5|Used to repair the roof of my class A motorhome, so far so good. will see how well it holds up in the Florida sun.
B003D73U6S|4|This is NOT rubbing compound!  This is step 1 AFTER rubbing compound to start the buffing process.  This does a very good job at starting to polish after you use a rubbing compound.  If you have swirls, oxidation or water spots from say sprinklers...  This won't get it.  I had to start with a wax suspended rubbing compound before this had much effect.  No.7 in the green&white can works well if you've got the old stuff.  The new style uses a different material to suspend the abrasive and it just ain't the same. Turtle wax carries a paste style rubbing compound that works quite well on a damp rag.  They carry it here on amazon.
B007HGF398|4|Helps to keep the vent going in a light rain, but if the wind blows the rain in the vent closes down.
B00A23V5EU|5|A+
B00559BMF8|3|**No Support, Company out of Business.** Product performance is very good however instructions and tech support is gone since EPA sued them.
B006YU7G8E|5|I use it because Honda Company says I must.
B00N4O7M50|2|Very Dim
B00FKPJLAK|5|I got these blue LED lights to replace another set that literally went up in smoke (wires all melted and I had to replace my dome light). These lights are MUCH better. They have great build quality and they are BRIGHT; several times brighter than the previous lights I purchased. The light 'bulbs/squares' are a bit on the big side. I barely managed to make it fit in my interior overhead light. I would definitely recommend these lights. Cute queen seems to be a decent brand. I'm also running some of their blue LED light strips in my car's foot wells and they're great.
B0008G5ENY|3|Everything kinda fits loose. But its strong enough. Wish i could buy just the drop hitch part in order to swap from 1 7/8 and 2 inch.
B0136IOZ5I|4|I received one (blue) towel as shown on this page, measuring just under 16\\" square (about 40 cm on a side). It's a nice weight cloth, heavier than many microfiber cloths I've tried, and it's a very useful size for use as a large washcloth or cleaning cloth, or for a drying cloth when washing the car.<br /><br />The seller describes this simply as a microfiber material and doesn't give any information other than that regarding materials or care. Normally fabric products include a tag with this information, but the sample that I received had the tag cut off for some reason. This bothered me, however when I queried the seller they confirmed to me that their towels will include tags in the future.<br /><br />I do think that it looks like a good quality product, and if I do find that as I use it over time that there are any other comments to be added here regarding durability or anything else, then I will return to this review and update it accordingly.<br /><br />I received this towel at no cost from the seller and for the purpose of review, and I have no affiliation with either the seller, or Amazon.
B001DDMB2I|5|it did the job for me
B0031HEIDY|5|Very bright and literally half the price of a single pack at any store.
B000BXOGNI|5|This product is my go-to product for cleaning small parts.  It does not damage plastic parts.  It cleans residue from previously glued surfaces so they can be re-glued. When the can is about depleted I order some more.
B000GZOG2W|5|Got my order before it was due, fast and prompt, love all the products
B00LFL8HPI|5|love it
B00PRKCWQS|5|It looks nice and does the job... I don't know how the quality is after sitting on it for a while but first impression is just as in pic
B00G620ZVU|5|Really good! And bright!!! Installed it for my ATV.
B00N5AYP8A|5|Great quality, fast delivery!!!
B001VLK0RA|5|Great pump. Works as stated and now I don't have to lift heave containers of fuel
B000C94F5A|5|Perfect
B002E1AYKY|5|Work fine
B00WGXI1BO|5|Perfect and super cute! High quality and love the pink color to go on my laptop.
B00H2W0ZCW|5|First time I used an inline flaring tool and made 4 perfect flairs.  Love it
B005BNYWXW|3|This was the first one of two attempts with LARGE levels with the metal ball in the tube (different manufacturers). They seem to have the tendency to stick with small/slow movements. Too frustrating for me. Think you're level, then come back or rock the camper and you're off. What good is it to see from the driver's seat if you have to get out and jump on the trailer, then start all over again? I ended up with a smaller one that only uses an air bubble. Glad I didn't drill the holes.
B007K2C2H0|4|Good
B0007WJQ4M|5|Easy on, easy off and easy to install
B000EQ8GVA|5|so far the rides been smooth.. cant complain on my Jeep 2001 Wrangler
B0013916XW|5|Works well!
B006R34PB4|4|One front plate doesn't work but bright as heck.
B000E5XMOC|1|waste of money - poor fitment.  The filter is fine but the issue is with the rubber ring.  1) the indents to allow for the screws are not correct.  2) the bottom of an F355 filter box has a raised ring.  The OEM filter has a female indent on the underside of the rubber border to accept this ring and create a good seal.  It does this because the outer foam aligns properly to the ring and it is somewhat soft.  The K&N has to be stretched/worked in order for it to seat properly.  Because a) the K&N is oiled and b) the rubber is stiff and not pliable, it's not practical to get it to seat correctly and take one hand off of it to seat the air filter cover and screw the cover to the filter box.  I've been screwing with these for 30 minutes and am done.  OEM filters are going back in.  I was going to put these in a 355 and a 456 but now - no way.  Waste of money.
B000X42QJG|5|This item fit nicely except... the mounting hardware was a bit flimsy and cheap.<br />So I had to go to Home Depot to purchase more secure hardware!
B003YOXUT2|5|Exact fit for my camry 96. Price is great, saved a lot by just buying this and replacing the broken hose myself instead of having the shop do it.
B00A3DIXJO|5|fits great
B00ARUSWMG|5|Awesome replacement part - worked great!
B002R0YMXC|5|Great price great look great fit. More than adequate packageing. Would buy from them again!!!!!!
B00IDGOBDA|5|goood
B000JFL7RG|4|I wanted something that would give a fairly accurate reading in the -50 F protection range. (about a 55/45 mix) as places in Michigan have hit -40 F the last two Winters. If I pull the antifreeze into it slowly to avoid air bubbles it seems accurate within about 5 degrees. It does give me readings between -34 and -60 F where my &#34;floating disc&#34; Hydrometer could only tell me it was OK at -34 F (50/50) and when it was beyond a 60/40 mix.
B00XOKU940|5|It's look very good . And working without problems. I used it in Subaru Forester 2000, 2.0L, Non Turbo, Japan-type
B001T9BY88|5|Perfect fit, replaced in under 2 minutes works perfect!
B009O91SEK|5|This remote worked like a charm for my 2003 S500!!
B000C9HF3O|5|well made.
B008LQSPKW|5|Worked well and seems like great quality.
B00FB3MT7S|5|Everything I expected. Super fast delivery! !!
B000VU1H0Q|4|Exactly what I needed.
B009304KLS|5|It Fits. Pure and Simple. Excellent Solar Protection.  Well built and designed.<br />A bit of a hassle when rolling up, but with practice and use, it gets easier.<br />Worth it due to high temps in S.Texas lately, keeps the car at least 20-30 degrees cooler than without
B008PD8D12|3|These don't last that long for me and are too stiff
B00230B928|5|For he money you can't beat them . They work great for 4 wheelers.
B001BK6CA0|5|Wire was a little short
B000C8Y1VE|4|Exactly what I needed.
B000CSW7K6|5|I'm glad I didn't buy OEM! This works flawlessly on my 2011 BMW 325i E46 w/ M54 engine!
B0000AY4YX|5|OMG - this stuff worked great on our RV!  We recently purchase a used Class C RV which had spent way too much time sitting in the eastern Oregon sun without proper waxing, exterior maintenance or protection from the elements.  Not knowing much about fiberglass, we figured the dull sheen on the outside of the RV would be something we'd just have to live with, and keep reminding ourselves how great the deal we got was when we purchased it.  We stumbled across this oxidation remover mainly by accident, and after reading the reviews thought we might give it a try and see if it could help.  Well holy bejeezus, this stuff worked great!  It definitely took a lot of time and the use of a variable speed buffer (do NOT try to do this work by hand!), but boy was it worth it.  The fiberglass siding went from a VERY dull appearance to a VERY clean and shiny appearance.  I'm including a few pictures here - the first shows the exterior prior to using the remover...very dull, no shine and not very attractive.  The other two pictures show the exact same spot after using the Meguiar's...so much more clear and a great shine there now!  Not sure if the pictures I've included do the product justice, but I can say this - before we used this stuff there was no shine whatsoever...after using Meguiar's Oxidation Remover, our RV has a just-like-new shine that looks better than it has in years.  With proper waxing, care and maintenance, this shine will last us a very long time.  Thanks, Meguiar's!!!
B004AA1PUK|5|This is just what I needed for my Rubbermaid gas can. Its an older style gas can and they don't sell them anymore so replacement parts are hard to find. The vent cap broke off years ago so I've been rigging it until I bought this. It fits perfectly with a tight seal. It would likely fit most other gas cans with a vent cap as I think those are mostly a standard size.
B00YFRXMR2|4|A wire was loose in the wiring harness, after I fixed it everything was ok.
B0002JMIEK|5|I didn't buy this online. Bought it in stores. The out come came amazing!! I love this product. I will be applying this to my boyfriends car and surprising him .
B00BCRMBSO|1|Very cheap feeling.I definitely would not recommend this product
B000GU5IH4|5|Good product! Very good quality
B00LEBLI82|5|Thank You!
B000CB1QX2|5|Just like O E
B00E5OUOCQ|4|The product is good!
B00CM589B8|2|The piece I received measured 40&#34; in length - but width varied from 9 1/2&#34; to 20&#34; - with both ends measuring 9 1/2&#34; and center to 20&#34; - cut unproportionately from 20&#34; center to 9 !/2&#34; on both ends - not a square for sure nor even an oval shaped cloth -  leather itself is very THIN - I don't believe it is of cowhide nature but can't contest to that fact - very soft - I have other cowhide shimmy's and are thicker and are stiffer - I will announce at this point in time that I have not used this shammy yet, so I cannot attest to efficiency.  Will say however, that this item is not as described.  Hope for the best.
B008THPW8G|2|I have been riding with your Billboard Flair windshield for about a year. The main drawback is the leaf blower force wind coming underneath it that is aimed squarely at my face. It blows flying insects right into my full face helmet and the blast whistles through my ears. I have read on a Switchback blog that fork mounted wind deflectors can correct this, I though you might check it out for yourself.
B009EL6JV0|5|Great price right muffler
B00NXG5FHQ|1|bought it, installed it, it worked fine twice and the third time, after 5 minutes, the starter switch arc'd over and wouldn't &#34;stop&#34; &#34;starting&#34; WHILE THE ATV WAS RUNNING.<br /><br />Ruined my surprise birthday present for my daughter.<br /><br />Junk
B00B7SZPZE|5|I've had these a year now and they still look and work awesome.so happy with them.
B000JUR54A|5|They Sound super good
B000EA5WLS|5|Got a crack in our car windshield from a flying rock.  Even though it was only about the size of a nickel we couldn't get any repair companies to fix it because it was right at the eye-view of the driver's seat... they all recommended we spend hundreds of dollars to replace the whole windshield.  Well, since we couldn't really afford to do that, we decided to first try out this DIY repair kit and see if it could do the job.  Let me tell you, it's fantastic!  It sealed the crack, minimized it's appearance, and has prevented any spreading of the damage.  Super easy to apply also.  It's actually been 3 years since we used this product and the windshield is still holding up just fine.  Great investment!
B00A3V5A74|5|works great and recommend it for all chain applications
B00Y1HUJYK|5|Perfect !
B000RZR2W2|5|My camper is smiling!
B00ABZ7IDQ|3|It does what it's supposed to, and the quality of the material is nice. Just not crazy about the aesthetics of it. Should use with a short thermos, or something you can lock the top off to keep the liquid from escaping. I tend to get coffee all over the bike and jeans when using a regular coffee cup.<br />Also looks dorky as hell like I knew it would.
B00X9M3GPW|5|arrived sooner than expected and they work well.
B0023VFS9W|5|Fit perfect on our 2001 Grand Am.
B00F23BNUG|2|These burn out in months. I've returned several becausse of leds flickering and dying.<br /><br />Two stars only because they honor their warranty, but force you to mail the bad ones back (at your cost)
B000KYYBU6|5|Awesome.  Programmed to my car in 15 seconds -- easy to use instructions..
B00UUAUK3M|5|Looking good on my car
B00E5OUOCQ|5|These are for the hubby's Cadillac, and they aren't quite big enough for the XTS windshield, but do the trick just the same. Oklahoma summers are hot and bright, and this keeps the surfaces in his car much cooler to the touch.
B00T86ADZ4|5|I use this thing to calibrate my grain mill in my brewing setup. There are lots of different widths for all manner of applications and it comes in a small form factor. BONUS: It is well oiled from the factory so you don't have to worry about your unused gauges rusting together, even in moist environments.
B002MBEA1K|5|Does the job!
B000VW3LU8|5|High quality Pittman arm. Fixed the bump steer.
B00CG674GY|5|Left one (of 2 of these we have) out in the rain. As expected, it didn't work , but when I carefully took it apart I noticed the quality inside. Cleaned her up and now I have 2 excellent inflator/gauges. We are  a high volume UHaul dealer and depend on a quality products like these. Highly recommend these. And, oh yeah, two of my buddies have seen them and ordered ones for themselves.
B0091OE6K6|2|Doesn't work well at all.
B00CTGD5DC|5|GOOD FIT
B0034ZU76A|5|Worked great on my Audi A4
B000CITK8S|5|Great charger it has the automatic shutoff feature which is nice, keeping a tender on batteries can drastically improve their life span. I had my motorcycle battery on a tender and the battery lasted 6 years before I replaced it, and it was still working just getting a bit weak
B00WH13DJ0|5|I use this microfiber glove to clean my computer desk, keyboard and monitors. The medium size fits my hand well and picks up dusts nicely, even from the tiny gaps on my keyboard. I also use it to dust my shades/blinds since the material is so soft it doesn't damage them. It is a great buy for the price. I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.
B003RQBKLC|1|DO NOT BUY FOR AN iPHONE! At first it worked. Then it started sending messages to the phone that the wire does not fit iPhone and now it doesn't work at all. Unfortunately, it is about 45 days from delivery, so Amazon won't take it back. Does that mean there is only a 30 day warranty on products Amazon sells? Why would anyone buy something from Amazon, for example electronics, if there is no easy way to return/exchange outside of 30 days?
B000BPSW7C|5|The BEST I have found.  It states on the bottle, ONCE a year, but I would say TWICE a year.  Maybe I just wash my car too many times a year or the sun/rain effects the finish.  I don't go by shine I go by the beading.  Nu Finish beads up GREAT, but after 5-6 months the beads don't seam to move as freely, there is still beads but smaller beads and the beads kinda stay in their place, so I think it's time to re-do.  Nu Finish works for me....
B00O83LZ9A|5|Perfect Fit
B00GGA8JE2|5|This helmet gets top marks for style its flat out badass looking. The slits on the top keep you very cool with heavy gear on even in hot weather. Can  be somewhat noisy on the highway, but it doesn't distract from the ride at all.
B00H7H6ORM|1|Not bad
B002P33KVQ|5|works great
B001MA1P24|1|Trash!!! Does not give white light as stated- just regular yellowish dull light-absolute garbage.
B001UHQXQ2|5|Works well. Good price
B0039LDF4A|5|Did the trick and saved hundreds in unnecessary repair costs for the front forks. Highly recommended and easy to use. Be sure to check out the YouTube video for how-tos.
B000E35WEC|5|+++++ EXCELLENT AND LIFETIME WARRANTY.  Fit our 1990 4Runner drivers side front door perfectly.  Worst part was the install.  Removed door panel and  then I had to remove the complete  window assembly in order to remove the old motor and install the new, but it was worth all the effort now we can actually close and open our front window again. Five-star A+ all  The way  +++++
B000AA4RWM|4|No complaints, works well.
B00BN460BK|1|The finish flaked off.
B00OIJF9LY|3|Best shaka decal I have found yet, it came days before I thought it would and I was stoked! I couldn't be more happier with my decal, it looks great on the back of my car.<br />Thanks Gliders USA :-)
B000GU7I3Q|4|Overall not bad and does fit and looks great with my near same color motorcycle
B0027Z6CY4|5|Please disregard the ignorant comments people have made about this chain not being new and it arriving rusted. This chain is a very good chain for a great price. Pulling / logging chains like this one are made from low carbon steel. Carbon steel is very strong but oxidizes very rapidly (or rusts in your words.) You cannot keep a good quality chain from rusting unless you keep it coated in oil or buy a stainless steel anchor chain which is very expensive. Due to this chain sitting on shelves until it is sold, it will rust. If you are using a chain I hope you wouldn't be worried about getting your hands a little dirty with some rust.
B00S9371ZC|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B006FUT0CS|5|As an apartment dweller, I've been waiting for years to find a product for people who don't have a carport or a garage for their car.  That's why I decided to purchase TWO bottles instead of one.  Plus, Meguiar's has a great reputation for quality car care products.  If my car-nut older brother endorses the product, it's good enough for me.
B000FGLQCK|4|Just as described. Sturdy and works fine
B0002SR53A|5|good stuff
B009IFIKCI|5|Fit perfect
B001N0E188|5|So one of my hub caps on my 2008 Jetta Volkswagen popped off and it was gone. I purchased this hub cap, and it delivered in a few days, and it's fits and looks great!<br />Very nice fit. Just make sure you put it on right!
B003PZ0HG4|5|A little pricey but worth it. Made well, and covers the 2015 Prius' windshield perfectly.
B00ISF4MRQ|1|This product is not what it looks like at all. Theres nothing to hold the leather in place on the arm rest. It just lays on top of it like a table cloth. The leather isnt seamed and is badly cut. It falls off if you swype your arm by it easily. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B00H9L1QY2|5|Great price!!
B001JSYC74|5|Great product Great service
B001US95S4|5|Did the job fix my turn signals
B00JOUC1FO|2|Writing on bill does indeed say &#34;CAMAPO.&#34;  This is a licensed product?  Maybe from GM of Serbia.  Read the return policy.  Buy this for laughs or stay far away.  Really want to give money to outfit that intentionally sells you a faulty product and sets up return policy so you probably won't bother to return it?
B011CVDNEA|5|It's like having small headlights in the back of my truck.  If they don't light the first time you insert, pull out and rotate bulb and reinsert.  You *might* have to pull the contacts out a little so that they make good contact.  Don't give up on the first try.  I got several different sets for the truck at the same time and had to adjust the contacts on a few.
B000F17HG4|4|This fit OK.
B00OU5LOT2|5|The lights are amazing and its cool how you can change colors etc. I was just a little iffy about buying these but so glad i did. They showed up in my mailbox two days after order and it was suppose to be a week. It comes with everything you need to install and you can install it just about anyway you want. The options are endless. Would recommend this to anyone and will definitely buy these again years down the line. 5 stars
B00BFTYH7M|5|night and day on kia forte
B0065S6S8Y|5|Did the trick!!
B000K00DSO|5|Perfect replacement
B006ZVFARQ|4|These did fit however the length could have been a bit longer as I was unable to use the plastic washers and still have enough thread to repLace missing screws in existing visor.
B00OFRUUPE|5|I really like this cover for my key fob.  It was getting all scratched up.  I did however make a small change to it.  I purchased the black one and since I have not had my car for long I need to be able to see what the buttons are and even though there is indentations of the buttons being black they are hard to see so I used a white ink and l filled in the indentation then wiped it off so the white is in the background so I can see what the buttons are.  I also used a black sharpie and cleaned it up a little.  Now it is perfect for me.  And my fob will last a little longer.  I am not sure of the function of the light weight chain, maybe that is for decorations but is a little too light to put a key on.  The fob fits very well.  Has plenty of room. Update:  5/21/16  Well I have had this key fob cover for a while now and am happy to report it is still working great.  It still looks great.  I have read quite a few reviews complaining about the fit.  This item comes with foam I think 2 pieces.  I used 1 piece of the foam put it on the bottom.  And over time it has compacted down but still fits good. The white inc I used to make the indentations stand out has worked perfectly Update. I have now had the keyfob over a year. I have purchased 2 more as a gift. You still need to add some foam to make it fit well.
B00W9EBF0Y|4|Cool, cool, cool.  I no longer have to stress every time I pull in the garage.  I find if I pull in too quick I'll sometimes bypass the green light but not an issue as I never miss the yellow or red!
B00QMWQMAW|2|Very low priced and you get what you pay for. Very thin and flimsy. If I had to do it again I would buy a more expensive set
B004J30G7G|5|Got the atv running again
B005D1HVAS|5|nice.
B008FWCLHU|5|I don't know about battery. I bought this based on reviews. It fit my 95 E320 and start the engine great so far.
B00BITKV5G|5|Worked perfectly!  recommend highly!
B001TMAC3S|5|Perfect replacement for a broken cup holder. Easy to install - just take your time and be gentle when removing dash trim to access the 2 screws to remove holder.
B0016KH20E|5|Used with a Reese drop mount, easy to mount. Purchased wrench to screw this on and was towing within 10 minutes. Great quality.
B000BZI2HC|3|everything fine ,fit , but not the right color ,I receive black instead red.
B00Q4V9OOM|4|Ok
B001TK7CYM|1|The foam padding around they eyes is poorly attached, of poor quality and there isn't enough of it. Uncomfortable to wear.
B00RW4MWV2|5|easy to install and what I expected. works great.
B0055DR3FW|5|Great
B007S0LDME|5|This is the best holding tank product I have ever used.  It is extremely easy and has eliminated the normal holding tank smells that you get with most other products.  We let a friend of ours try it too and it solved their odor problem too.
B00KTHXZLU|5|Wish I would have bought these sooner. These definitely provide a cheaper way to replaced your broken clicker. 'chirp'!
B00LDR9866|5|Excellent
B00S3GTN6U|5|Fast shipping great product.  Fixed my car right up.  Perfectly gapped.
B000V55NAQ|5|it does the job well
B00EVPLXY2|5|no plastic junk here, just the quality ive come to expect from OTC.
B00XR3IQEY|5|Great price!
B001GH3R7Y|5|I love this kit ,  and it looks really great on the jeep.
B00192JGN0|5|Good product
B005JWEWO4|3|This product is not bad, just incomplete. I was looking for something for my friend who works outdoors and handles weapons as well for his job. These gloves looked great and I even asked if there were other pieces or components that were required for these to be heated. I was told &#34;no&#34; and that they would be fine. That was not the case. These require a battery pack and cords, and that is just the bare minimum. There is an actual coat that goes with these gloves which have spaces for the wires and battery pack. Maybe if the coat fit the regulation uniform I would have purchased the whole set. Heck, if I had known this required extra parts I would have bought the set, or maybe not because it should have been sold as a set. If they are more up front about what these gloves require I might try again.
B00IPS4APU|4|i had a very long crack... it was not fresh.<br /><br />I used it as per the instructions, and the crack didn't disappear. it did however seem to subside in some areas while remained the same at other areas.<br />It did say the crack shouldn't be longer than 12&#34; though... and mine was.<br /><br />So i'm giving it 4 stars because i think it would've worked if my crack was fresh and small...
B00GU5IYWA|5|Fast shipping, good quality part. I love it!!!
B005F9IKUS|5|Fit as expected. Been on there about 3 months and i havent had any problems with it falling off or anything.
B008YFTB4E|3|My product is defective one of the lights don't work at all. After submitting the problem I received a new set.
B00J4W10XG|5|Perfect fit!!!
B012XIP074|5|This is a very good product, not only are they low energy bulbs but they light up very bright. I put these in My YJ and it adds light to a low lit area. I will be ordering more in the future for my other vehicles.
B005H5338O|5|Really good product,I really think is something everybody have to buy
B0040ZCP5Y|5|Spot on  . ! !
B00DGYEVR0|5|Excellent item.
B000NNONWK|5|As advertised<br />Nice quality<br />Fits 2014 Indian Classic with windshield and bags
B00C4YL27A|5|Great stand I use it for lawn mower motor stand all so
B0091YV1F4|5|real nice bulbs
B00MTGCYAW|2|This light string does not light purple, it is more white than purlpe
B00IKJ2OMA|4|AVERAGE GOOD. JUST A LITTLE INCONVENIENT WITH  ONE OF THE &#34;NUT TREAD&#34; IN THE UPPER PLATE, FORTUNATELY THE BOLT &#34;&#34; RE-TREAD&#34;&#34;  THE NUT.  TILL NOW WORKING WELL, JUST WAIT WHAT HAPPENS IN THE NEXT 6 OR 12 MONTHS.
B00V9HLIN6|1|after 2 moths of used the light are dim really low. can't see anything.<br />Bad product don't buy it.
B00KN0E56M|1|Plastic clip to headrest snapped AND I was being careful. My refund time passed so I lost that money!
B001IA9JU8|5|These worked fine on my 1991 Chevy Camaro Convertible.  They held up the hatch just fine, and were definitely stiffer compared to the current supports.  Those supports were probably 10 years old, and were some no name brand that I picked up at the local auto store at the time.
B00PVEUHU8|5|Works well for what I needed for
B00469FOL6|5|Want to save time and precious water this is the ticket.  Can give my landcruiser a decent wipe down in 15 minutes in my garage in the shade. Not for serious cleaning but excellent for touch ups.
B0051ACYA8|5|no spraying oil all over when it hits the drainer now.
B0046BI6ZU|4|Does it come with one or both covers
B00OYXK7C0|5|gave as a gift...they loved it
B0036GP6BI|5|Fits good. You need the tool to use the bands supplied in the kit. I just reused my old bands.
B001LQMX8Y|4|It's very thick and sturdy. It looks really good. On my 2015 jeep rubicon.... It covers a little bit to much of the license plate numbers but it looks great and it's not too bad! Loved it!
B007V2C1JI|4|Has an odor.  Not easy to put on and take off.
B0007VBUAQ|4|Fit a 2005 Chevrolet Avalanche like a glove, took no time at all to install with no issues
B002MQAW2Q|5|Keeps them clean in the off season.  Plain would be nice.
B0103JVJI4|1|Erparts the company and the owner were very horrible to deal with..Would not buy anything else from them..Worse purchase ever.
B0015D4ZH0|1|Piece of s*** I've had it not even 2 years the switch broke months ago now tonight I lost the relay box and of course no one will help me cuz  its out of warranty STAY AWAY IM TROWING TOOLS
B000LG5MVA|5|Quality exhaust matched perfectly with Airaid cold air intake and Gibson headers. Increased horsepower and torque. At start up, the exhaust note is mild. Barely noticeable over stock. Civilized around town. But on the open road, the exhaust growls! Fit, sound and performance combines to provide exceptional value.
B003RAHUOO|4|These remotes were not compatible with my vehicle, but seller had no problem making good on a refund.
B003EOXF4C|5|Used in Rally car, held up great.
B00WW4TNSC|5|A+++
B00JJ671XU|5|These look great after several months of wear. I did wax them before installation. They are individually packaged. Leave the plastic covers on and it protects them during torquing. These are a very good value
B009UKXBM0|5|She loves them. Great quality.
B002WP362U|5|JUST WHAT I EXPECTED
B00YRJI3D6|5|received it today and I was happily surprised it comes with two key rings to attach to the big ring this is so nicely made.  My favorite color is blue and I am really loving it. It is leather and is very sturdy and the ring is secure so it wont lose the keys off of it when its tugged on at all.  I especially like that it allows me to organize my keys on it and makes my whole set of keys look so much nicer.  it allows me to easily start my car and take off my house key in one easy motion in case I have to run back in to the house and I don't want to turn the car off or its great when I want to warm up my car in the morning and easily slip the house key off to lock the door when I leave.  It was received at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I am really liking it a lot and would recommend it if you are trying to get something that looks more grown up and you cant go wrong with leather
B0014DDGJ4|5|Best value.
B003DNL8YI|5|fits just fine to my car!
B004W96XOM|4|Perfect fit and great look,  only issue was one light did not work and needed to be rewired.
B001T7JWN4|5|Good stuff!
B00DPBNQQ6|5|These leds do not come with the blue housing but I think that is a good thing because it will throw off colors, I use them in a riding mower. They are 70 lumens and you can mow at 4am if you are a 3rd shifter. They work great and are durable, I would recommend replacing all 1156's you have in cars or whatever with these, barely draw any power. Great item!
B001LR61BI|5|We traveled with friends that had one of these and really liked it.  So we bought one too<br /><br />Great for taking on the ATV's for longer trips
B00AW020SS|3|Cheap
B006FUT0CS|5|Best shine ever! No water spots, just like  Rain X effect in your whole car.
B00O2I5ILM|5|Very convenient...
B000B5PAH2|5|very good
B00JXS7N82|5|fine product
B009JRECG8|4|After some confusion about the year model I requested, I finally received the correct item.  So far I'm very happy with the visors and hope the adhesive holds up. There were no directions for installation but an  experienced friend guided me and installation was easy. Be VERY careful when ordering to ensure you click on the correct year model for your car – double check your shopping basket before you commit your purchase.
B007PP2NJ4|1|Product was missing a clamp and one of the pipes were slightly dented. Clamps were undersized so sealing connections are not possible. No fault of the seller but more on part of the manufacturer. I don't recommend this product, but the seller is definitely trustworthy.
B001BNFV0Y|5|Awesome mats. Look great. Lots of compliments.
B007LQHJ4Q|5|So far so good! Running like a champ!!
B009KW82CC|4|It's heavier than you expect, but fun to play with. My boyfriend gets compliments from his car friends
B001QGFWNM|1|They dont work
B005CHT4W6|5|Great oil for my Subaru and Volvo and srt8!
B000A09MCM|5|What can I say, it's a filter!  But price was great S/H excellent!  That's why I shop Amazon!
B0068NOWO8|5|Fit 2001 GasGas EC 300. Stock chain length is 114 links but the stock rear sprocket size is 48 teeth. With the 52 tooth rear I would recommend a 116 length chain since I had to move the axle as far forward as possible to get the new 114 I ordered to fit. This is great for turning ability but not so much for stability.
B00HG2UEBA|3|I was disappointed that it does not include a pin to secure it in place.
B005AT05JM|4|So far so good. Its been installed for a couple of days now. Took me thirty minutes start to finish to install it. Really stiffened up the drive line quite a bit. Makes for good shifts and reduced brake pulsation. Slight vibration at idle, but that has to be expected any time you are installing polyurethane products. Overall I like it.
B00GE8QK3I|5|It came with all the lights i needed and their is a big diference between these and the old one. Very happy
B007TCD58G|5|has the vw logo scratched out, great price for oem replacement.
B004975P0A|5|Perfect replacement part
B003L7T57S|5|This worked!  I have tried many other products but I can say this is by far the best.  MPG and acceleration was vastly improved.  Will buy more for my wife's car.
B001C5U9A8|5|For some reason it said it would not fit my 82 cj7 but it fits just fine. Old shaft was wore out from my 35s and this one tightened up my steering 2 or 3 inches. We'll see how it handles the 35s.
B0027FSU4Y|5|I wondered if this will be strong enough for my dr650 , and it definitely is , used it also to break a very stubborn bead to the rear .<br />I wish they made a 19mm for my front.
B00LKRUNNQ|5|NICE sticker.  Have not put them on my helmet yet.  But DILLIGAF
B007LICL56|3|This is definitely not long enough to screw in through a license plate holder and the license plate. Thank goodness my hubby is the MacGyver sort and figured out a way to get it done on the rear on my vehicle, but it was definitely a no-go on the front.
B000CIRD1O|5|Perfact!
B00BY8KCFA|5|This frame stands out on my 2015 Cadillac CST
B006RQ44BM|5|=)
B004XRAOX4|4|Not only did they come super fast but they look amaaaaaazing on my 2012 Jeep Liberty. I'm a very edgy person and the spiked plates brings that edge to my jeep. I just wish there was bottom screw attachments tho, since the frame doesn't lay flat, so when I close my trunk you can hear it make noise.
B002IV3HKO|5|Perfect for our wakeboard boat. Wanted more of a UT like orange and these are a little more florescent, but they look good.
B00J4E1C6E|2|Ok heres the review rundown<br />Delivery.good<br />Package. Arrived with missing installation bolts and screws . 10$ extra to get from home depot and 2 days of looking<br />3 the quality of the product poor<br />4. It didnt fit my hummer h3 so it went to the waste
B000EPOHWS|5|These sleeves are a great repair part if your counterfaces are worn or pitted.  I used them on my boat trailer to restore the seal counterfaces on the axle stubs.  It takes some work and mechanical know how to install them on a axle stub because the supplied installation tool only works on a shaft that is 2 inches or less in length.  I had to fabricate a jig in order to be able to drive the sleeve in place as the axle stub shaft is around 6 inches long.  However, the alternative would have been to replace the entire axle assemblies which would have cost me over $1k.  These are well worth the money and the effort.
B009XP18F4|5|Used on a six hundred mile motorcycle ride with an open face helmet and goggles. Kept the sun and the bugs off of my face. Very comfortable and it remained in place. I recommend.
B00CRR5KXG|5|Arrived before I expected.  Installed in my car and is running great! Would order from this company again.
B00F5LN77W|2|Could not use the wave heater at high altitudes as ii gives of to much carbon dioxide .  Dust cover ok
B005N00GC4|5|just as advertised. Impressive emblem!!
B0038KAQBC|1|Very disappointed with this product.  The tabs meant to hold it to the wheel broken  while trying to put it on the first time, right out of the  box.
B00F542DQU|5|This is a great light! Very long cord, quality plug with switch, great suction cups, and very bright!  Only problem is that the plug gets hot because of the led bulb built in.
B0031ZFANS|5|Just an update.  I installed these in my 2005 Ford Expedition and my Dad's Lincoln Towncar over 2yrs ago and both are still running strong.  GREAT DEAL!!!!
B006CVKUGA|5|Works perfectly, arrived as promised
B000IZ1JHA|5|These are great brake pads.  Braking is smooth and quiet.  Fit my Hyundai Elantra with no issues.
B0062TQ8FY|5|I love it.
B00LV8P866|5|Great Jacket, Style, Looks sharp!!!!. Beware, &#34;is tight&#34; so take in consideration to order one size BIGGER.** Other than that,  it is a Great Buy!!
B000FRV6JC|5|Very good prduct,<br />Although the part is remanufactured it has worked very well in my car so far and for a lower price than the new part.
B0050H396U|1|Poor quality made in China. Stand barley held up my Versys (medium sized bike). Uses thin metal that bent
B00Y5I7VZU|2|Disappointed. Made from flimsy plastic.
B00JBIBAD8|1|Really bad experience one Headlight didnt work
B00DOP5H3S|5|Works as intended and easy to install
B005C9CAUW|4|Used it to tow a 6x12 trailer from Colorado to California
B001JT33F0|4|works as advertised
B000C840TM|5|No issues...worked fine!
B00JMCCBRW|5|Superb engine oil. One of the only 229.5 approved oils for my 2005 Mercedes-Benz C230 Kompressor. I was using Mobil 1 0w40 at first, but the car seems to like this a little better, not as much lifter tick upon cold start. If it's 229.5 approved and Ferrari recommended, you bet I have full confidence in putting this oil in my car.  5 Stars
B00BZSE20U|5|good fit but deeper lip would be better
B00429YAA6|3|Does its job.
B00Z23WD46|2|I love the look but had to return then the pasanger light sockets would not go in wrong waited 1 week for the replacement from auto denysty only to get a replacement that did the same thing and was broken and lose I could not afford to have my daily driver with out headlights for another week so I moderfied them to work
B000ALG0KS|5|Perfect fit easy instal and very economical
B00DVLOGP0|3|not that confortable.....
B00I5PUY4Y|5|Fast shipping and good quality item.
B000CIY0U6|5|I use this along with the bed liner. I read a recommendation to use the 3m high temp Velcro and so far so good. It's held on all summer here in Chicago. Definitely a nice cheaper route instead of spray in bed liner.
B003NHLLY6|5|Very pleased now my trunk stays up and doesn't hit my head anymore lol
B00WMCGKKI|5|They look great. No issues installing them. Peeled back on 3m tape and stuck them in place. They seem to be holding well.  I'm very happy with how everything turned out :)
B009FU6CN0|5|Perfect fit on my 2003 tundra
B00W5XD3DQ|1|Very small not worth $5
B00XY60TDU|5|looks and works like the OEM equipment , very satisfied  with product would recommend this product
B008L12HOC|4|WORKED FINE AFTER I HAD TO MODIFY IT TO FIT. HAD TO RE-TAP THE THREADS TO MATCH MY OLD ONE.
B00J9TZNVY|5|Looks great on the back of my car!
B001A1M786|5|High quality and good price
B0009IQXJ0|5|A refill of what I have been using. Goes on easy and lasts
B00D47A68C|5|Great having this in the car again. Fit perfectly. 2006 Toyota Highlander.
B001AX65QO|5|WORKS!!!
B00Z7N71UM|5|Works great!  Would like to see an additional head with even a smaller brush at the tip for some of those really narrow locations.
B00FSH0WM6|4|Works great on RV porch utility light, but double the output is available for the same price.
B007XE5LTG|4|good value and works as advertised.  Not as easy to read the live data but none really are.  Wish it would give you a range for the live data to know if you are within the range or not.
B00W8UJC4U|4|Works as expected right now, hope it lasts.
B00B466198|3|4 out of 10 bulbs are defective; will not light, or will flicker and shut off when there's vibration. as for the others that worked, they are bright, and do not heat up as bad as conventional bulbs. i reordered T10 bulbs that have diffuser covers on them as they look better and are not all jaggedy like these. overall, i am not satisfied with this purchase, as i needed 10, bought a set of 10, but only received 6 workable bulbs. i suppose it's expected at this price point.
B001DHC4B2|2|Bought this for my 93 Grand Cherokee 5.2l v8 and NONE of the mounting holes lined up.  The *bolts* that hold the (not sure what else to call this) mounting bars on the sides stick out too far to allow it to bolt up properly to the radiator AND go through the unused fins at the edges.  I had to remove the bottom brackets entirely in order to get it to fit.<br /><br />It was clearly 'designed' to replace the OEM one as it otherwise looks identical and its close enough that you can *make* it work with a little bit of patience, but the bottom brackets in particular bother me as I'd have had to take the dremel to them to get them to fit right.<br /><br />That said, as a condenser, it works fine...
B00JR3UDKS|1|This is VERY bad product! I will never buy anything that comes directly from China! One bottle came wet inside. Another had damaged spraying tube.
B004VNAKHA|5|Good, thank you
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Nice, small and easy to use. I throw it in my motorcycle tankbag along with a cable for emergencies.
B00GI2IJTI|4|Good product. careful for air bubble
B008SYHLA2|1|It broke immediately.
B00MJ0RNFY|1|I've been using this thing for less than a month and it already has a hole in it. Time to find something that won't wear out
B00HS5DRG4|5|I love how this adds to design on my ride, as though it came with car, from the MFG.<br /><br />Highly recommend
B0036C0PVI|5|well worth the money does as advertised
B000A6THXK|5|Matches my 2001 Expedition perfectly!
B00BD5GSWA|1|I was really bummed cause they didn't fit. The specs said they would fit my Rav4. They lied!!
B0064N00HK|2|didn't fit my engine..wasted my money
B00651CLCS|3|Good too a while to come tho
B000EQ0J6A|3|Bad: The inside heat shield, the one between the manifold and the engine, will block the oil filter. You couldn't change oil filter unless you take it out and leave the manifold without that heat shield. It is working fine but not as designed like Toyota did.<br /><br />Good: It works and hasn't cracked in 8 years 80k miles unlike the Toyota one that came with the car. It last this long probably because I took out the heat shield that interfere with the oil filter as mentioned above.<br /><br />For this price I don't think you can expect much, just remember what you are getting into.
B00OZ6VBH6|1|This thing is poor quality for the price. I purchased the superior essentials product for my other car - it's just a couple bucks more but higher quality
B00LEBLI82|3|For the money, these are pretty good.  The light is very white and does not put off as much light as the incandescent bulb. These were used in our motorhome and I have noticed some flickering when plugged in and running off the converter which has a slightly higher voltage (around 14v) than the battery.  Also, they seem to give off a very faint electrical burning smell (again especially when plugged in). Did notice our battery stays up much better when on a week long camping trip.
B008S0WLOC|5|excelent
B0000AYECO|5|Fast shipping and good price
B008ZDRSB8|1|Took to auto specialists and could not get a secure fit.  Upon driving, the rear driver cross bar dislodged -- thank goodness I was parked when I realized and not driving.
B000NNGNL4|4|This is a pretty good cover and serves its purpose but please understand that protecting your bike from the rain isn't its purpose. It's an indoor cover.....period. I bought the 'Cruiser' size which is advertised as being 107 inches long. The bike I'm using it on is a 1980 GS1100E that is 88 inches long as measured from end to end (not wheel base or tire to tire). If your bike is any longer than mine, you'll most likely consider this cover to be too small. It fits mine fine but I sure wouldn't want it any smaller.  It's much better to have some extra room because it makes it so much easier to put it on the bike. Ride safe!
B00GPWCVGI|4|cool
B002R4NGU8|5|Shoes came in great condition. Box was a bit dinged up think that's why it may have been a warehouse deal.  Love this style shoe with the built in heat shield, it's a shame that Simpson seems to be discontinuing them again.
B0023VMRRI|5|FIt great on our 2001 Grand Am.
B000ST3BGS|3|They look like the picture, and decent quality.
B0089HUROU|4|Would give it 5 star but the tape that is used to hold the Velcro could have been better. Other than that it's pretty amazing
B00MQ33GIM|2|The case itself is well made. But it was advertised with larger dimensions which would work for an iPhone 6+.<br />Upon receiving it, it would only fit an iPhone 5 and 5S.
B00WDSVEE8|5|Happy with the item!  It's better than the others that I own.  Will buy again if they have Gray or Brown color!  My eye sight is very bad due to macular degeneration, Gray or Brown color will probably help me see better than the dark color I bought.  Regardless, I'm keeping it!<br />Please send me an email when Gray or Brown color is available!  Thank you.
B008N82D2E|5|Get 1 soon you'll need it
B00LBFFLN4|5|Quick delivery and quality parts
B00K0OFSUS|5|Very happy with the look and fit of this bumper.<br />Very good quality for a good price.
B00K4P5QYG|5|Great pulls for my purse
B000N9K3O6|5|Worked well, some wires were slightly longer than stock
B00HRSTKS6|5|It does what it should do
B00A82J5Q0|4|Definitely brighter on the road and increases the field of view.  Whiter light makes it easier to see.  Would purchase again.
B000O388KM|5|I scratched my tank pealing a sticker off. This was the perfect solution!  I love the quick installation instructions. This tank bra gives my bike a great look.
B0031HTYA6|5|Part was exactly as expected and a perfect fit.
B0052LQQFK|5|My butt thanks you! Debated on this for a long time. I always thought sitting on beads, how is that going to be comfortable? Well amazing enough it makes those long rides much better. Thanks again bead rider!<br />Robert Smith
B0013FXXGE|5|Great factory part. Not much more you can say.
B00K85PLJM|5|Installed this system on a factory 2014 LT2 Corvette.The difference in sound and performance is amazing!!! Would recommend this to all corvette owners, you will drive the wheels off your car after hearing it
B0034NH404|5|excellent Helmet for the price
B001AWHL22|5|Fit perfect had no problems with installation
B00EPDKNSC|5|Product as advertised and looks great on my Tacoma!
B00CCSD6CW|1|Came in the mail all crinkles up and roll was bent, everytime i tried to put it on the crinkles in it kept pulling away from the surface, i threw that pos in the trash
B00HV50HKA|4|Brighter than expected, shorter than expected but all in all another great ITC product. Push the lens for on/off, works fine.
B004HSFDW6|5|Good price. Easy to install. Started right away.
B0053O9EUA|5|My Heritage Softail was running really hot...After I changed primary case and transmission oils, it ran so much cooler..now I can hang with 100 degree heat here in Houston...Nice color too.
B00RVECNMQ|5|It's so cute......loving it '
B00T36ST7I|4|Arrived quickly. Only 4 stars as one end was not machined well..not a round hole..mangled end..luckily my husband can weld.
B000MW91RE|4|As expected
B00RAJ4VAE|4|Looks more on the printed side of carbon fiber. Each piece fit as expected on my ZX14R. However, the outtermost ring was a little short in circumference. It fits along the innermost ring of the tank instead of centered. Not a huge deal, just shows some silver on the outside edge. Adhesive is good. Has been through a few heavy storms and stayed on. Overall, an interesting touch at a decent price with decent protection.
B0041RU14S|4|The color is close but not an exact match to Cub Cadet OEM yellow. It is fine for touching up bare areas you don't want to rust. But if you need an exact match, this is slightly off. Not too noticeable from a distance. But close up you can tell the difference.
B00EUG11C6|1|Had them on car for a while but car was on the road for only 3 months. Ball joints gave out and those small allen bolts fell out. Thank god it happened after i got off the highway. Maybe they werent built to handle NYC streets. They are good as a temp solution or emergency buy but not for long term
B008RIEQXY|4|Great little multi purpose accent/license plate light.  I used these as license plate lights after customizing my rear brake lights with flush mount units that did not have integrated plate lights.  A couple tech notes:<br /><br />The threaded part and nut is stainless, light housing is aluminum.<br />Thread size is 6.0mmx1.0<br />Length is about 1/2&#34;-3/4&#34;<br />wiring is THIN!!  You will have to use connectors that are 20-22ga to fit.<br /><br />You can either thread the mounting point (as I did) and use the included nut as a locking nut, or drill through and use the nut to secure it.<br /><br />Overall, they work well.  -1 star for the thinness of the wires but otherwise I am very impressed.
B00JS0AOI6|5|great for farming areas
B001EOV45G|5|Worked just great
B006JRJ5L8|5|Bought to combat high water pressure that kept blowing hoses loose from horse watering troughs.  Did the trick and I've gone close to 2 months without having to make any repairs.
B004AE0MUU|5|Order to replace on the van and it took only 5 minutes to install! Looks just like the original!
B002DRFSOQ|5|Great
B004091JOS|5|Perfect  match
B000MS5T42|5|The first 90 degree attachment for a grease gun that actually works!
B000E4HRRQ|2|Mirrors shake when driving. You get what you pay for.<br /><br />Service excellent
B00JDHQKEQ|5|Keeps me informed of my backside situations.  Nice accessory.
B007RDBFTI|5|Very nice and affordable ! Came in the mail within three days !!
B005Q05S6U|5|Great for my son to keep keys visible.
B00U8NXS7G|1|Bad
B005RNFBMC|5|Works like a charm!!
B0036VRQ70|5|Great product!!! 2 years ago (and 1,2000miles) I bought it and put it in my Pontiac Sunbird 2 liter engine that was leaking coolant into the #4 cylinder so bad that it was drenching the plug and extinguishing the spark. I had just installed a brand new head, so I'm pretty sure it is a gasket leak, not a cracked head. Well, just the other day after a long trip when I got home it was miss firing and so I pulled the plug and it was soaked with coolant again. I put in another 3/4 of a bottle and fired it up with a cleaned plug and it stopped it again within minutes. I'm very happy with the results. If I have to do this every 2 years I can't complain.
B0038HYYG8|4|Perfect fit. Plenty cranking power. What a difference. I'll have to wait and see how long it lasts.
B000BQPIGY|4|This stuff is terrific, I love it on mirrors & glass. The one problem? The spray can go everywhere! When I use it on my car, I have to spray the towel with the cleaner. It doesn't matter how close or how far away the can is, it'll go on the paint.
B00CZ6ZPKC|1|Do you have new lights like those that fits a 1989 ford. F150
B007EGH4KM|5|Fit my 2010 Mazdaspeed 3 perfectly. I previously had Dorman top hats when I installed coil overs and the blew out within a year. So far I've been on these for 3 weeks and they've been holding up.<br /><br />Will update as things change -
B002N5YDG2|5|Put the fan near the gas flame, and it's been running flawlessly ever since.  The refrigerator would always cut out when it got warm.
B009J2J0SI|5|These are great carriers. There were no instructions but the installation was simple on my Thule cross bars. They do the job very well and are well designed. You have to use the kayak to line them up initially. I plan to mark my bars with their locations so I can remove them and reinstall without having to align them again.
B00A71MPRI|1|Not that great a product.  The set screws rusted and the logos are cracking after being exposed to the florida sun
B00PX6DV84|5|I loved it very good!!
B001QFH2S6|4|Works great ,easy to install and calibrate,made tuning webers quick!
B008ESHU8A|4|I ordered wrong side
B00GUF74HQ|5|This item was a little difficult to install.  The instructions are not very clear when you start installing the screws.  Other than that, I would recommend that all pickup s install one of these tailgate shocks.  Works very nicely, instead of the tailgate just dropping.
B00429NKWK|3|Results were good but not great.
B000BRJOVI|4|it was great but i ordered one too small
B004SCNL52|5|Love this Jacket! This is my second one. First one survived a wreck, but I had it for over 5 years and in the accident it got scuffed up pretty good - BUT it absolutely protected me - no road rash anywhere on my upper body - Jacket looks good, fits good and protects very well!!! ALso love the fully vented mesh material - great for those hot summer days!
B000EEU0IO|4|I haven't even opened it,yet.
B0081SBYMG|5|Well made, easy install, great price, met all expectations.
B00URS69H8|5|Please make sure you use a blow dryer so the glue can melt and stick better.  If you don't use this procedure it will fall off.  I tried it two times and the second time it stayed on perfect.
B00389GAIQ|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B007RP3JS6|5|Excellent, worked like it should and only two seconds to replace with a 10mm socket and wrench.
B003XWEO7C|4|Got here fast looks great
B000FDYL84|5|Works very well, arrived on time and seems to be holding up so far
B004EDCR0U|5|Needed additional straps for our bike carrier.  These were fine.
B00L843KIQ|5|Works great with HIDs. Fit perfectly, installed in a few minutes
B00ESCFOMK|5|Daughter says these fit her great and work good so far.  She only rides as a passenger on her boyfriends' motorbike about once every week or two, so not broke in yet.  She likes the style too!
B00I0FOK8U|4|Decent quality. Fairly quick shipping.
B000VU4WK8|5|Received in 3 days.  Exactly as described.  Heavy duty and well constructed.  Fit perfectly on my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500.  Installed in under 30 minutes.  Half the price of similar products.  Process couldn't of been better.
B00WVN7UWK|3|I did find it was pretty bright as a running light. What I wasn't satisfied with was that when I activated the turn signal there didn't appear to be much of an increase in the brightness. For that reason I ordered the led white to amber swithchback bulb from JDM ASTAR which I love even though they cost more. Seller is excellent to deal with. A quick refund was issued when item was returned.
B001U25WBY|5|This jacket has it all for motorcycling! I zipped out the winter inner vest lining and its very breathable yet I still have the protection of the jacket and level 3 armor.  Loving this purchase and got the Xelement pants to match.
B00H7QWNZ0|4|I recently bought a used mini and my key didn't have the original plastic chrome ring, and because it looked a bit odd I decided to buy this one. Shipping wasn't too long and it makes my key look better, but the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a tad loose. Even though it bothers me a little, functionally of my key isn't affected and my key looks better.
B00P7VVFF6|5|Good!
B00404WDUC|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B00IWMX0BY|5|Thank you. Very fast.
B000GAOT88|5|Third car, third time this product has graced the trail hitch connection.  Very nice indeed.
B00XV82A74|5|Very nice addition to my Star 950 ! Good quality!
B004A0ZLZA|5|Awesome product but it could come with some instructions.
B00ONHEXUO|1|Not realy they do not fit the way they are supposed to
B00GHT7ZYM|3|It works, easy install.
B00T9LR9FA|5|thanks
B003CK0C3K|5|Very good
B00ECTRBHA|3|From the photograph, these appear to be solid, smooth pieces like you encounter with manufacturer's logos and badges.  They are not.  These are a flexible, fairly thin plastic material that is metalized.  The surface is not perfectly optically smooth, but has some lumpiness to it.<br /><br />That being said, they were easy enough to apply, seem well-adhered and they are shiny and silvery.  They are just not as smooth solid or thick as that nice photograph would suggest, and so they look a little bit cheaper than I'd hoped.  I'm satisfied, but not thrilled and the vendor should be somewhat ashamed to use a photograph that misrepresents the product.
B0036F593E|1|DO NOT buy these. They are so flimsy and cheap, you could easily break them just by putting them on.  Those pink plastic spoons from baskin robins have more durability than these.  I would actually wear them but there is a plastic peice that sticks out that stabs your nose bridge...I will not wear these.
B00KTHYBMW|5|Great key fob replacements. They work flawlessly.
B000RHXU3U|5|Does the job
B0000DYVN9|4|My wife loves it!
B008G4Y076|5|Good product, very bright, gets the job done
B00USOI18G|5|good stuff seems expensive for a few pieces of plastic!
B0040CRVD8|5|Exactly what I needed,Thank you!
B00YBQYMRG|2|Not very good quality.  Cheaply made but for 11 bucks you get what you pay for. Not very bright but in the night time it would be noticeable. The positive wire came loose from inside the light within 1 hour of first receiving the light. I had to spend time re-sordering the wire to the light. Do not buy.  It's not worth it.
B000W0RQ8C|5|High quality
B00694C05E|5|Easy to apply and beautiful
B004RH6BL4|5|Exact fit. I just purchased a 2014 F-150 with 5.0 motor and searched the web and found this PCV costing around $40. I had setup my garage on Amazon and searched for a PCV and found this one for under $25. I think this is a great buy and a great find. Everything about this valve is identical to the Motorcraft part I exchanged on my truck. Oh, just one more bit of information. Motorcraft wanted $48 for the exact same valve.
B00N373G94|3|They are thick. I live in the land of the swamp butt. It's incredibly hot in lower Alabama. I was hoping these would be thin. Way too thick to wear in the summer.
B00ANZHG4U|3|Not as plush as I expected and their is  more little balls if material than I expected.
B008X03498|4|Replaced both front on a 1993 Honda Accord EX Coupe. Installed without any issues. I've owned this car for about 5 years and the struts I replaced were original so I don't know how it's supposed ride with new struts but I'm happy with the results. It handles much better. It's a little firm over bumps but no more than I expected for a car this size.
B000WGNNUQ|5|Works as expected transaction went we.l
B000CITK8S|5|Works perfectly for what it was designed for I now own 2 of them.
B00CFNMBDY|5|Perfect fit for someone allergic to the rubber compound of the shifter.
B0041U93Y4|5|Dealer wanted $450 for a replacement and another $300 to install. This was a perfect replacement. Searched for a 15 min YouTube video and it was done. Really glad I found this.
B00T56A5P0|5|Running and brake lights on my Burgman 400.
B00KHUQDSG|5|Just what I was looking for fr my car!
B002LYTHUM|5|I got this ramp for my '07 Road King. It works great and is easy to load and unload my motorcycle by myself. Folds up and slides right into my trailer without taking up much space. This is a great ramp, if it holds up over time.
B000A09MCW|5|Product received quickly and works as expected.
B002Z64P4Y|3|Easy to use and good for the price.
B00NIK98O8|5| (v*37.5)- 18.75     Worked just as expected.  Thank you
B000E28C7M|5|Have been satisfied with the filter.
B004L08GC4|5|Good, keeps my mail person off my septic tank when receiving my plethora of Amazon shipments.
B005LXTOHQ|4|looks cheaper than original but fits and works perfect
B000CAZ33W|5|Is what it is.
B00075XCCG|5|I had no problem installing it with my son's help on my 2006 Honda Pilot. It did take a little work cleaning rust from 2 of the mount holes. I used the metal brush from a battery terminal cleaner and lots of WD 40. I did remove the spare for easier access. I do recommend a helper, especially one with muscle! The main bolts require 86 ft-lbs - I could could not come close to that with my 18&#34; torque wrench, lying on my back under the car.  Fortunately my son is big and strong, and had no problem tightening the bolts to the required torque. If you are not strong armed, I suggest that you ask for help from someone that is, or get a torque wrench with a longer arm!
B00S5R56B8|4|It works as I expected. The sparse documentation has errors, but it works well.
B00QREL2PA|5|Didn't fit tailgate
B0022ZUQCI|5|I have three sets of these now.  Really nice product.  I use them for packing my motorcycle luggage and keeping like things together when traveling.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Outstanding value for what it is, and surprised/happy that it has functioned flawlessly for me. Also surprised that was delivered as quick if not quicker than Amazon Prime.
B004LEYJO4|5|Quick delivery, item just as described.
B004HO7GGG|5|I got these calipers for my Tiburon a little over a year ago and they are still working great. No problems whatsoever and I even sprayed them with some caliper paint to keep the corrosion from forming on the caliper from all salt on the roads in the winter. Great buy for a great price.
B0080DWBA6|5|Perfect fit for 2011 ford fiesta. Good packaging.
B008EEYVDQ|5|I will always use aisin timing kits & water pumps when available . Always perfect .
B007V2EC86|5|Works great and looks good in your windshield really gives your car a custom look.
B00EO0RN5M|4|Just what the doctor ordered! Slapped this set onto a friends' Lance Vintage and everything snapped right into place (aside from the weird angle of the plug, that is...). Scooter fired right up and off she went - thing had nearly 6k miles already and was sounding a bit rough. Hard to gauge any change in performance, honestly, but she says it's got a bit more 'pep'. She says...
B001U522GO|4|I love this kit and bucket. I was hoping the logo was a screen print, not a sticker. Silly, but true. I also wish they would upgrade the wash mit to the microfiber mit. I would even be willing to pay a bit more for that as a package. Overall, great, well made goods.
B00AV8HSA6|5|Works perfectly for my 2006 ZX6r. Assembly was very easy, just make sure to have hex wrenches available.
B003172296|5|Super easy install made my buggy that much more of a kick butt ride
B00NQHXEG6|5|This decal rocks! Super easy to put on.  I love how they recommend using a Credit Card to smooth it out, it works really well lol! :) IT sticks very good, and I've no issues with any peeling.  Very good quality!
B00KJ8L8AE|5|Decent price since I spent $200 on the set for my headlights. I finally decided to make moves on putting HIDs on my fog lights. I was skeptical about the quality when I first ordered them but decided to give it a shot. They came and the ballasts had a good weight to them and everything seemed nice. So far so good. Extremely bright projection and what seems like a great product for the money...so far ;)
B000LN4MAA|5|Perfect fit and it worked fine.
B000CHQIRA|5|Great price on this quality Sander
B004I0VJM6|5|Exactly like original, but seems much clearer!
B000AM8BJU|5|works easy & well
B002R1NCO6|5|Perfect fit for my 2002 Beetle Turbo S, looks much nicer than the hazy lens that was there
B00X7FEFJW|5|Good product
B0016J5KJU|5|Perhaps not as convenient as the fold up style, but this shade fits great and seems durable.  Im glad the reverse side is white to avoid blinding others.
B00BSEZIQI|4|good replacement
B00UGLDBZE|3|The decals were too long for a Mini hood, better than too short.  There was no transfer tape.  Asking one to peel off the decal without using transfer tape is just asking for trouble. The radius on the leading edge did not match the hood.  Sorry for being so critical.
B000GV4UPO|4|system fit as advertised and looks good, but still a little louder than I like.
B00UNRU5KK|3|Very light / thin for a 4 layer cover. Seems to be a decent cover just not a heavy duty all weather cover as advertised. As others said, this is one of those you get what you pay for items. My truck is stored under cover anyway so it will work. I didn't notice the &#34;made in china&#34; or I would have expected it to be less than advertised.
B00ESNIZBQ|5|love this
B000BZZR34|3|stopping power is good, wear is also good. what I dislike about these is that they have no coating on them to prevent rust! One overnight rain storm and in the morning there is surface rust all over them! that's fine on the braking surface as it will wear away with using the brakes but it stays on the hub side and edges.
B00BR4JTBE|5|The original wheel center somehow broke or came loose, and fell off on the road.  Never to be found.  The replacement wheel center is a perfect fit.
B00A9RH23M|5|Looks great
B000PA82QO|5|Perfect fit for my car. Definitely recommended.
B00Q34DWRU|5|I followed the suggestion in the installation instructions to put it in the sun for a while to warm up and it helped a lot. A little thicker than I was expecting, but a nice, comfortable grip for long drives.
B0055R5TRC|5|Top quality decal
B000N9LCH8|5|just had to get longer screws to mount it on my 73 9.5 johnson.
B00JQOPVVY|5|This is a great product. The design is solid and if works as advertised. You definitely need to make sure the adjustments are right or you could end up taking it on and off like me. I had the kuryakyn grips and followed a video online on how to put them on. Everything worked out for my '06 Honda Shadow Aero. Holds the grip in place and can adjust it for different speed. Brake lever also releases the control besides the front button. Just make sure you absolutely need it. The only time I'm really using it is on the highway (and mostly just the straightway). This is because there is no computer adjusting your speed. If you're turning hard or riding hills, the cruise control is not best suited.
B00V30J86I|5|I am very satisfied with the purchase!
B0018PDK6C|5|Works fine on my Jag. The whole blade assembly is tough to replace on this car because the washer system attaches to the assembly. It's much easier to replace just the rubber blade, this and the corresponding 18 inch one worked great, cost is low, and since they come two per pack, I've got another round of replacements to use.
B000E81VN8|4|For those of you driving a Tesla Model S, this organizer fits almost perfectly in the foot well of the trunk.  Great accessory to compartmentalize items so they stay put and don't roll around.  Adjustable dividers make for the perfect fit.  The one I received didn't have any of the odor that others before me experienced.
B00MQADLTO|5|They go the extra mile to make you happy. Recommend
B002N3F02K|5|Removal of factory parts may be difficult because of location(especially the rear exhaust. Changes colors because of material, wrap with header wrap before install. Very loud because it removes all cats, if you won't cats purchase a High-flow cat and weld-on after install of headers. Also be careful choosing cat-back exhaust due to the fact it eliminates the cats may not need a 3 in pipe unless boosted. All in all, it served my baby well, R.I.P. London....
B00BUKFRD4|5|Best machine glaze I've ever used.
B00C6BWYYG|2|Everytime I open the rear window the end pops off.
B002HXSA4Q|4|Fit snug on my 05 ford escape
B000GZV3X2|4|Worked perfect on my FXDWG. Cable was a little long but worked out fine.
B0057B4DSC|1|Bought this mirror because of positive reviews, price & allegedly Original equipment standard, after receiving I had it painted white to match car, then the fun began. While attempting to install, everything matched up, the electrical connected properly, so what didn't work. The3 bolts from mirror going through door frame were too short to start nut. It took me a little while to determine the bolts from the original mirror were about 1/4 inch longer than the mirror I was trying to install. It was simply impossible to start the nut because of this difference. Finally out of desperation and no alternative, I went to Home Depot and picked up a heavy duty c-clamp and smashed the two inside door frame metal pieces together enough to start the nuts, not exactly what would be recommended or what I wanted to do. It is astounding that the mirror could fit in all other aspects and yet the bolts be 1/4 inch less length than original This was installed on a 2004 Ford Taurus wagon. CAUTION: IF YOU ARE REPLACING A MIRROR FOR A 2004 FORD TAURUS DO NOT BUY THIS MIRROR UNLESS YOU WANT TO BEAT THE HELL OUT OF THE INSIDE DOOR FRAMEWORK, BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET THE BOLTS TO THREAD ON THEIR OWN. Who would ever think this would be a problem, when everything else looked proper, unfortunately I didn't have original to compare when received, this was a company car off site, with the mirror hanging by electrical cord on side of car.
B00S4HFNXK|4|These are nice.  They work very well on the corners of docks as permanent fenders.  The shape is definitely a plus, they don't roll around like the round fenders.  They appear to be sturdy and will probably hold up well against UV.<br /><br />The shape is also better for storage just as the description stated.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because a darker color would be better so mildew and dirt wouldn't show.
B00NOIKON8|4|This stuff worked awesome!!!!!
B00405U60A|5|Great fit, works as advertised.<br /><br />Rolls up like wrapping paper (not foldy or elastic like some) so storage may be an issue for you if you have a passenger.
B000CB0KFC|5|The Maxie runs much smoother now.
B00SRFPG9K|5|Love my new mats!!
B00H858P3Y|5|I like this xenon. The only thing that happened was the secound day the entire thing wasnt working so i had to get a stronger ground. Make sure ur ground is strong when installing
B008FCE8IA|5|Helped make our 16 hour car ride on vacation more enjoyable having &#34;stuff&#34; on the roof and not in the car.
B00BVYCQF6|3|Work just fine.
B00N3VYMJ8|5|works very well! driving with one arm makes it easy!
B002YIK7I6|4|A stitch seam came undone on back side of the first chairs sent . You sent a replacement per our request. the two chairs are holding up very well. They take up a little more room in our motorhome to store then other chairs but the rocking and leaning back of the chair is well worth it. thank you
B00E5OUOCQ|1|While the shade met the design shown in the advertisement, the edges fail to cover the windshield.  Not a good fit for a large windshield.
B00LPIA3T4|5|Awesome little tool set! FWIW, I bought JK6089-C. Unlike some of the other reviewers, mine came packaged well with all the bits secured in their respective spots.  A few nice design features.. the lid is spring loaded and stays open at 90-degrees and, with the built-in mechanism, the bits go from 45-degrees (lid closed) to 90-degrees (lid open). It's already proven quite useful and I'm sure it'll be getting much more use tinkering around..
B00CIB1SZA|5|Excellent Decal! Loving it! Going on 6 months so far with it!<br /><br />Good-Buy
B004AE0DAY|5|It's fit right for my wife car for the price autozone can't beat it
B001E3HUAA|5|Excellent indoor cover, fits perfect, looks sharp
B001HJR9XE|3|You have to have an old horn button in an old truck.
B0002TDUW4|4|Trying to save some cash, I purchased this DIY bedliner kit to replace the plastic bedliner I already had. After about 5-6 hours of labor, I'm very happy with the results. The only issue I had with this product was the pad that came with the kit that is used to prep the bed. It's basically the equivalent of the abrasive side of a sponge. I ended up using sandpaper and an electric sander and that got the prep job done much more effectively and quicker.<br />P.S. It states that a gallon will only cover a 6 foot bed but it easily covered my 6.5 foot bed leaving me with some leftovers that I'll be using for the bumper.
B0090IRKUG|5|great better than clay
B00KZC60KC|5|It has performed great! I am going to order another one for my boat next!!
B00SF519TI|5|Excellent Product. Shipping was lightning fast.. I couldnt believe how quick it arrived. The scanner works on my Nissan 2002 Xtrail NT30  Japanese made (Not for US market). Surely has saved me a visit to the auto mechanic shop and saved me $400.00 I have read reviews that most scanners dont work with Nissan Xtrail 2001 - 2003 vehicles. It was luck and chance and it was worth it.
B00VYKRL84|5|Great little lamps, but one had threaded nut glued to light. Threw away, the wires are very delicate. I would buy again and use as turn signal indicators because size and color. I would uses quicker so possibly get replacement for bad lights.
B00ODOQ30K|1|It didn't fit my 2004 Infiniti G35
B0040DXAWI|5|Pretty impressed of how fast it came in and really satisfied
B00I59XBEK|4|I received mine today and put it on the cover. It was really easy to apply. DO NOT pay attention to how it looks in the photo. Mine is about 8&#34; just like the name of the product clearly states. If you're not planning on having it next to the trackpad then you're fine. Based on other reviews, not all of the decals seem to be the same size, but for under $4 and free shipping, I was willing to take the chance. I'm pleased with the product. It also came earlier than the expected delivery date. If you're a big Harry Potter fan like me, I would definitely recommend this product to you!   I ended up removing the sticker a few hours later because I didn't like where I placed it. It was easy to remove and did not leave residue behind. I promise there are no complaints about the product, this was just something personal. I'll probably buy another one in the future.
B003175FMC|1|it was a piece of useless junk
B00G1YF068|3|It is probably OK, but my Can Am Spyder did not like it. Caused a VSS computer error code.
B00FJV4IVW|5|Big, sturdy and useful !
B005HFYE1O|3|Just a quick comment here, in automotive wiring a length of wire 6 inches long and 2 wire gauges smaller is considered a fusible link and was used in the engine compartment. This configuration was used often in the 60's, 70's and even the 80's, can't speak of earlier years as I haven't worked on them. Today the automotive industry uses fuses boxes in the engine compartment making it easier to find the break.
B000GVD0VE|4|Surely not as well constructed as more expensive option but for the price very nice. No issues thus far.
B010N7RW2S|3|The products looks and feels high quality with a really nice case. It jump started my 4cyl 96 camry out of the box and i was really impressed. I switched off the car because i was just testing the product. Next day i wanted to take the car to the shop so i put the kit again. I had fully charged it this time but it didn't work. A brief crank and red light started blinking. I tried several times disconnecting and starting again but it didn't work. I figured i got a bad piece so i ordered a replacement.Same thing happened again. It worked the first time out of the box and never again.<br /><br />Looking at other options. It sucks because i really liked the product and next day shipping was awesome.<br /><br />UPDATE: Anker's customer support is great, unfortunately the product isn't. They gave me complete refund and send me another (third) unit. It also had the same problem as mentioned above.<br /><br />UPDATE2: After the third faulty unit i was provided with Anker Compact Car Jump Starter (different model for smaller cars) free of cost which works well with my 4cyl camry. Bumping up rating for good customer service.
B000XJRYQ6|1|Dried out not packaged professionally.
B0024ECE22|5|Works really well. I got the blue stuff previously and that didn't work well at all.
B00YY7M4AO|5|Works well with very little lag
B00A7WIVNE|5|Awesome product! Check out my review video https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwW2BRPLe4EGlsf4QJ5VNUg
B007JSGR9Y|1|Never worked.
B0019C4Y6E|5|Car looking great 👌🏼👍🏼
B000CQDKFE|5|Easy installation.
B00CPKV8JU|1|The seat worked well over the existing seat, but it did not work for me at all.  I used this on a ride from Connecticut to Laconia, NH for bike week and I didn't end up using it on the ride home because it made my butt hurt even more than the regular motorcycle seat on my boyfriend's bike.  I ended up using bicycle shorts I borrowed from my sister and those worked better than this seat.  Amazon did take this back and refunded me my money, so it wasn't a loss.  I had high hopes for this, but in the end it just didn't work for me.
B003NBFKDK|2|Here's the deal... this cargo carrier is fine.  It holds a good amount of weight and doesn't wobble. It's a very good bargain from a price perspective.  However, if your exhaust is the same height as your hitch, I would not recommend that you buy this carrier.  The exhaust on my Dodge Durango started melting the Highland Cargo bag that I bought with this carrier.  I did not even have the exhaust up against it.  It was about 8 or 9 inches away and the bag and suitcase that I had inside of the bag were very hot.<br /><br />I had read from a couple of other reviewers that this happened to them so I actually brought aluminum foil with me on my trip.  That was a great move since I taped about 4 layers of the aluminum foil around the corner of the bag to help deflect the heat.  We then stopped about every hour to add on new tape since the duct tape would actually burn off.  When I got to my destination, the cargo bag had fused to my luggage due to the heat and everything inside of it was very warm.<br /><br />So, if the exhaust isn't the same height as the hitch, go ahead and buy as you will be pleased with the purchase.  If it is the same height you are taking a chance that I would not recommend.  You can also look into getting an angled exhaust tip that points the the exhaust away from the carrier or you can purchase a raised hitch adapter or lift kit.  This will also help keep the cargo carrier from scraping the ground when pulling out of a driveway which happened to me as well.
B00BITJPK8|4|Good
B00E0RFDE2|2|I have received order but not installed yet. I thought it was plug and play - same as window auto visors but seems a bit more intricate. Will install this weekend. Seems to be make of good quality materials
B002R0MZ1I|5|Great fit , fair price
B00QSIL4CG|4|Alright product looks great
B00NQVFM9O|4|USEFUL
B00515NJTI|5|Great product and everything was great after installations.
B00NX1VOAI|5|Does a great job of conditioning your leather upholstery, and has a really pleasant fragrance that will make your whole car smell nice.
B000ZIC18Q|5|I accidentally ordered two of these.  However, when I heard the speaker in action on my mobile radio I decided to use the second one at home on my HF amateur radio.  It is not the highest fidelity speaker, and I usually perfer headphones for serious operation, but it is nice to use as a forward firing speaker for general monitoring.  It has worked very well in my mobile installation.
B004FZ9FWK|5|Works as described. Great quality. Use this in a high volume repair shop.
B00QN92SWU|5|Works great on a 96 Suzuki dr350se, no leaks, bolted on and filled her up.
B00030BFN8|1|Charger fried the first time it was plugged in.
B00H5A4F22|5|Looks good on my civic,  and the visibility it's amazing... really recommend for all those lower cars out there
B00XLMVAMQ|5|looks great on my girlfriends car
B002GJM5B0|5|Worked well fits perfect!
B00A6YJB0A|5|Nice plastic unit.  I drilled through it to allow pin to hold it in place.  The little tabs were not in the right location for my receiver.  Came fast and looks nice.
B003V3RVWI|5|Griot's products are the BEST.
B00TJD0ZW2|5|This charging station is excellent, just as all the other reviewers reported.  Thanks.  We've only been using it now for about a week but love how much faster it charges our 2012 Nissan Leaf than the 120v charger.  The components are all very good.  The 25 foot charging cord has a very flexible outer insulation that makes for very easy unwinding and winding up of the cord.  The holster for the plug works very well and the cord locks into it with ease.  The instructions are clear and the packaging was superb.  The supplied mounting hardware is also very good and robust...heavy duty lag bolts.  Excellent product.
B00OZK7EVO|4|My man loved them
B0031DTHLQ|5|Fit exactly
B00V4049K2|5|I skeptically bought this product after reading it's reviews and thought that thirty dollars was a bit high for an air freshener but why not give it a try. First and foremost I did not want me car smelling like flowers or really any scent for that matter; I just wanted to remove odor. I usually leave my cleats and sometimes socks and other clothes in my car, and living in south Florida humidity it can cause a smell. After adding the PURGGO air freshener, the difference is amazing. I have been using this for about a month and my car smells fantastic. No body odor, no mildew odor, no sweat odor, nothing but fresh air.<br /><br />Note: Does not add a fragrance, but simply removes odor.
B004C6Q46M|5|Installation instructions were perfectly clear.  I took it to the auto shop on base here at Fort Detrick, put it on the lift, and had it done in about 3 hours (counting sharpening drill bits and such.)  I'd imagine you could do it with jack stands or drive-up ramps, though it probably wouldn't be very fun.<br /><br />The hardware is top quality, and I torqued the bolts down mighty tight.  This thing doesn't rattle, doesn't squeak, it's rock solid.  I could probably lift the car by the hitch.  Price was excellent, too.
B00KTHZ6NA|5|I'm very happy with this remote. I followed the directions on their website and within minutes I had it programed.
B008FCDBPQ|5|Very pleased with this product.
B0009N30EQ|4|Great organizer

B00EC9TLLO|5|awesome item!
B00CC2ZUHM|5|Turns on fast  looks very close to oem products
B00THR39SC|5|Was purchased for 05 Silverado the product has some quality issues, but  was resolved by the company
B00CHS6TGM|5|goood
B011MF8WEM|5|SAYS IT ALL -- THX
B00TV6SCNG|4|The light and bar are of high quality. The installing of the product is where the problem lies. The wiring to the relay was wrong in the instruction I could not get it to work according to their wiring diagram. Had to wire it differently to get to work. You will have to go to an auto store to buy some wire and adapter because the old wires to the blinkers will not be long enough with this light bar they are about 5&#34; to short so you have to make your own extensions. They should of known that an Include an extension in the kit. The switch provided broke after 2 times on an off. So I had to by a new switch. So I had to spend about $25.00 on wire, plugs for the wire and switch. Took more time to wire then it did to install. It is a pain to run the wires thought the light bar, do not mount the bar until you have all the wire fed through the light bar. The adapter for the turn signals that I had to buy did not come with any instruction. Over all I'm happy with the look and the quality of the light bar but not happy with the time it took to install. Plan on spending 5 hr to install.
B000EQ3EC6|5|Fit my 2010 Mazda 3 , not much else to say....its just a filter
B001U2DPUE|3|.have just tried it one time and it improved the quality of the picture but did not pick up any extra channels
B00J7TZEGA|5|Works great
B010H0QV7S|5|This is a nice device to keep in your glove compartment. The tire pressure gauge works great and I was surprised how little air escapes the tire when checking the pressure. I also found it plenty accurate. I just used it to check the tire pressure of my car's tires and it turns out they needed a little air as they were a little under what the sticker on the driver's side door jam says (33 PSI for my car). I also compared the readings to another gauge I have used for years and found the readings very close to each other, either exact matches or only 0.5 PSI apart.<br /><br />The flashlight and red safety lights are nice touches, although don't expect them to be very bright, but they could still be of great help when you don't have anything else available.<br /><br />The quality of the tool overall is good for the price. The quality won't blow your socks off but you shouldn't expect it to given it's price. I haven't tested this but be careful not to drop it. I'm not sure how many drops it can survive, but if you will be using this often then you may want to get something more rugged, but for occasional and infrequent use it is fine.<br /><br />Makes a good gift for anyone who owns a car.<br /><br />Overall 4.5 stars and rounding up to 5.<br /><br />NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review. I was not paid or told what to write.
B00ZOS51KW|3|I ordered what is shown in the picture (KIA Oil Filters) but instead I received Hyundai oil filters.  Luckily they work with the KIA.
B009D0VWR8|5|perfect no complaints
B00EWCRFMI|1|Worst wrap ever won't stick to paper, just go and find 3M and be done with it.
B009DJTY5Q|5|Very good!
B00GHT8NAC|4|No problem with  item, I purchased it for my 2004 2500 HD but it will not work for 8 lug wheels.  The hanger is to small for the hole.  This part is for the 5 or 6 lug wheels
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Ridiculously Bright.<br /><br />Not cheapo lights that purchased on eBay (or Amazon).<br /><br />Great quality, great fit, and I can see the future with them as my cargo lights.
B001TE0IMG|1|This was supposed to have protection on it, to keep it from overload!!  IT DIDN'T!!  I purchased this on May 20th, 2015 for an Amish friend, to use to power a message telephone. There were some problems with hooking up the telephone, so we did not actually even use it till just yesterday.  We hooked it up to use it & it was DOA.  I don't know if I can return this, since so much time has passed.  Since it sat &#34;new in the box&#34; all these months, I was NOT HAPPY!  I wish we would have tried it out sooner!  Live & learn!
B00BFTYHNG|5|these were instant night and day on my kia forte
B00BME0LV6|1|This is NOT the OEM emblem!  The Back plastic parts are like a chocolate brown in color.  Put the old and new emblem next to each other and its like night and day.  The adhesive on the back is total wrong and only behind the flag part (the OEM is on the entire backside).  Its a ridge plastic VS a flexible plastic.  I am going to send this back.  I only purchased it because it was advertised as the OEM and the picture shows the OEM part including the back side picture but when you open the box it is NOT THE OEM.  The OEM parts purchase come in a sealed GM bag, this was in an open bag with not writing on it.
B003LZ4IK4|5|This works great. Using it to keep the battery (12v- 7Amp) charged in my camper.
B003TQ2W44|5|Best gauge I ever owned. Ex airline mechanic.
B00017YYI6|4|great
B00V5EISZE|5|Great used one on the bears plate I bought
B012HHWBJG|5|Seems to be good quality, only time will tell. Great customer service.
B00T5G53ZM|4|Works great with my 2013 Jeep Wrangler.  Use it with my Android OS and the Torque Android App.<br />Super small, can barely see it.  Had no issues syncing to my Galaxy S4.
B00KTIYXLU|1|Both stop working after a month
B009HK235E|4|Item is as described, front and second row. Front row is cut a bit smaller when laid on top of the original mats. Second row stretches across the entire row which is easier to keep the dirt inside. Both mats are like an insert which allows the dirt/water to be trapped inside. In order for item to be used as directed, it needs to be the only mat on the floor. If you attempt to use item over the original MDX mats it will not clip.
B001Q4QO2C|5|The Seller provided fast service and a competitive price.  This was a smooth transaction with no complaints. The gun rack was easy to install and works great.
B00GNHPA2W|5|Excellent
B000BO8Z9I|5|Great for the brass on my designer bags.
B0063ZBXZC|5|Arrived quickly and was easy to install.
B001QT9KO6|5|I had a small antifreeze leak in my 97 F250 that I couldn't find where it was leaking from. I tried K-Seal and after 3 weeks so far so good. Make sure you drive your vehicle for a good 45 minutes to 1 hour after adding K-Seal. You want to make sure it mixes with your antifreeze.
B00B0QWXW6|5|I drive a Honda Civic and I got the Level 2 protection to play it safe and avoid being stopped for obstruction of my license plate. (NY) It fits good and doesn't look bulky, my brother has an accord and its looks good on his too. Some may have to get longer screws to instal the front bumper protection. I highly recommend getting this, especially knowing no one is going to mess up your front bumper.
B00BYNJ7HY|5|Used these on a gmc sierra 2006. Work great ride is so much better. Easy to install. Would recommend.
B001PNO4OE|4|A little bit too big for my particular project but other than that I'm very happy
B0052UBO62|1|2004 Nissan Xterra. 10 attempts NOTHING. The keyfob would not activate while in programming mode. GARBAGE. Sending back
B003VDX5D2|5|This is a great and useful safety tool. I am 67 years old and its very difficult for me to get in and out of my pickup when I need too. This will help greatly. I just installed it yesterday. Now I can get in and out easily. I do have some improvements to mention. Maybe I should have given it four stars, but even without using my suggestions, it's a great addition to my truck.<br />First, I am always concerned about slipping, so I added stick-on abrasive non-slip abrasive strips to the ladder steps. Helps me feel much more secure.<br />Second, the bottom of the ladder, (the part that comes into contact with the ground), is smooth. Nothing there to help grip whatever its resting on. While testing it in my shop it already slipped once. I plan on adding a couple of rubber pads, (or something similar), to the bottom.<br />Bottom line, this is a good product and will help me with the things I do. I think you would like it too.
B001QVFD4K|5|Great product
B002FV2P78|5|Great price
B00LUPOU1O|5|Great product.
B0006IX7WY|5|Works great in the RV refrigerator.
B005VKLGUW|4|Simple and straightforward.. My Honda key broke I bought this one took it to a key place. They fixed it for like 30 bucks and I was on my way. Good buy compared to Honda dealership charging 250. Just keep your original key holder because they need the chip from it.
B004Q1Z8JM|4|Just put this on a Honda CT 90.  Had to drill out the top hole so the bolt would fit and modify the lower one with a bracket but after that it lined up great.  PLEASE NOTE- when I tried to kick start it it was kicking the kick starter back really bad.  You just have to kick it HARD and FAST and it will fire right up.  Also be careful when I was putting the kick start on the bolt snapped in half.
B00DX88XBO|4|Not as comfortable for off bike wearing, but meet all of the needs otherwise.
B00NEESARY|5|Fast and a perfect fit!
B005GL86Z4|5|For the price and my needs this works just fine

B00CNX98TQ|5|Fits perfectly!
B00NQEN0DG|4|I can only give a four star review on the compressor due to one of them going bad 6 months into its life.  Blew 40 amp mini ANL fuse so I installed another one.  Popped as soon as I put it in.  The other 2 compressors are still running good on the fuses put in during the initial install.<br /><br />I'm going to give a review on the compressor for my application prior to losing one.  I tow a 20 foot enclosed trailer with a lot of archery equipment in it.  Due to the excessive load on the tongue of the trailer i decided to put air bags on it to help out.  I bought 3 compressors due to the fact I am not interested in spending a long time changing tires on the roadside in south Louisiana heat.  I put them in my truck tool box and mounted a 7 gallon aluminum tank as well.  They will run an impact used in removing the lugs, on the truck and trailer. They have been very good up to this point with airing up tires, mine and strangers, and scaring people occasionally with the train horns.  I have a pressure switch for 150/175 on the tank and a regulator for the air bags and the horns and another for the air line fitting.

B00NLMHSV8|1|The size too big we couldn't use it for my Dodge ,i don't recommend it for such car size it might fit a full size SUV not a sedan
B000XY4ZNG|5|AAA+ product.  Exactly as advertised.  Works Great.
B002UC4XHM|5|Replaced my short rain gutters with these.  It was a simple swap and now we have no more water running down the sides of our camper or that annoying &#34;drip, drip, drip&#34; through the night.

B00OZYHOE2|5|These tactic point brands motorcycle windproof goggles are awesome I love the cute little case it comes with and the nose cushions. These were easy to put on and use for both me and my husband. To drive without a helmet or goggles is a big no no in my house and these goggles are great to add to our collection. They really are windproof. From all the others I have tired at home and from local stores these are definitely the best.<br />I received my motorcycle goggles complimentary for review purposes. All thought and opinions are my own and are not influenced by anyone

B00544ZBYW|2|The bulbs only lasted about a year before one of them burned out. I went back to the standard OEM halogen bulbs as they'll at least last a couple of years. It's such a hassle to change the bulbs on my RSX.
B006RMMN3M|4|These worked but were not as bright as the original incandescent bulbs.  I needed the lower LED power consumption for a boat's electrical panel back lighting so they are OK for that.
