B00D3ZHRCI|4|Not yet worn, but everything is great!
B007OX0VFU|3|cute but material is not soft - kinda &#34;crunchy&#34;. i gave them as a gift so i'm not sure if washing helped.
B00JAOBS94|5|Wonderful product. Fits exactly as it should
B00CAV03HM|4|I was skeptical, because I couldn't wear wool when I was a child--but these are not itchy at all, very comfy!! I wear them around the house constantly, they are a little bulky for some of my shoes, though. I have noticed that some seem larger than others, not sure if they've stretched, or what. Overall, I am tickled with these socks.
B000MFVOGW|5|This works great!  I'm able to pump and get other things done at the same time.  Sizing is true - I got a smaller size than I needed just to make sure that it was going to be tight enough to hold in place without using my hands, but I should have just gone with the correct size.  I highly recommend this for any busy mom on the go or anyone who likes to multi-task!
B00C6705TG|4|Love these for my dad!  He will love them when he is hunting!  Carhartt always runs a little small on sizes, nothing new!  Got a size bigger :)
B00JUW0FBI|3|With sizing chart i bought much larger size than needed
B00DNSR0SG|3|i reccomend getting this jacket dry cleaned. i washed mine and it frayed in some places.
B00BSEV8MQ|5|Love them
B00A1625R4|4|As a frequent buyer of asian clothes I didn't expect the quality of the hoody to be great, especially since it was from allegra K. Now reading the reviews I was to re-correct the prior buyers and the future buyers. XL in asian is a M in america. Since sizes are naturally different in different areas it means you're getting the size you'd get in Korea. Hehe even with medium as a girl its a bit big but I look derpy so I'm happy. Quality was more than I expected, but don't expect something you'd get a abercombie and fitch. The spikes sometimes don't stand up but what can I say most hoodies would do that. Best of luck to the future buyer and I hope this was helpful.
B00OVIKR1E|5|Fit perfect.
B00BBT9M80|5|Great pants. Fits as expected. Love the color.
B004XG21BS|2|Tops are too tight and cut off circulation to the foot.
B00KNTUCQA|5|Love them. For the price you can't beat it. Will definitely purchase more when need to.
B002EMKJ30|3|Material isn't so comfortable but acceptable. Won't recommend to anyone. Given its quality, hope it can last at least 6 months
B00MPDJ5HO|3|To my surprise, the item arrived within two weeks. The quality was fine, but it runs REALLY small. I'm 5'5, 115 pounds and can usually fit into a small, but I had to purchase a medium and the bra was still too small.
B002POIC6S|5|Lets just say my husband loved it !! 😍
B00FMYL5XA|5|Great colors, love the light weight, easy to twist and turn to get it the right length that you want.
B007PSEDEY|5|This material (bamboo) is shimmery smooth touch and it is cool, but it looks almost wet.  I want to wear it all the time.  I especially like this cool blue color -- it goes with almost anything.
B00JLH75R4|5|I found THE ONE!!!!!<br /><br />After many, many, did I say many? Attempts to find a new bra after Olga stopped making the one I wear, this is a perfect fit!!!<br />I'm between a 34-36D or DD, depending on the style. This one I wear in a 36D and it's a perfect fit.<br /><br />The cups are not padded nor even have foam, which is hard to find in a plain cup! They are double lined so no see through. You can definitely wear these under tshirts or thin material and no show through.<br /><br />The cups are a full coverage fit so it's not low cut like a Demi style. They cover completely but show just enough cleavage and chest area to look nice if you were planning to show someone, just FYI. Hard to describe exactly but I can wear v neck shirts and tank tops with no problem and I am modest.<br /><br />The band is wide enough that is actually DOES smooth your back. So no more of this rollie pollie stuff, smooth. I can't believe it. It also comes up the perfect height under the arms to keep skin in, but still can wear sleeveless shirts without it showing.<br /><br />This is a minimizer bra, which I have been wearing for many years, I'm in my forties, and I don't feel squished nor stuffed. I feel completely supported!!! And the girls have never sat up so nicely as they do in this bra, naturally!<br /><br />The straps are what sealed the deal for me with my love for this fit anyway!  They are completely adjustable so you're not limited to how tight you may need to make them. I like to feel supported with no bounce and this does the trick, whilst not acting like a push up, flattner, or anything besides natural.<br /><br />I first tried this bra on at Kohls and bought one for a test ride. I loved it so bought one of these lavender/rose ones here at Amazon, with this seller. I was a little skeptical that the fit would be off, but it's perfect!!!! So I ordered two more! (sorry buyers ;) hopefully the seller will get more in stock of this color.) I couldn't find this color in a 36D at any retailers including Nordstrom.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm stocking up on these bras, in each color! I don't want to lose my beloved fit like I did with the last bras I was was wearing for about seven years.<br /><br />Great price, fast shipping, and quality made and packaged! No cheap material nor stitching, and they hold up well in the wish. I use woolite, cold water, gentle cycle and hang to dry. Good as new.<br /><br />I've only been wearing these a few weeks but so far so good! Hope this helps, especially if you are like me and in search, need;), of a new bra with your specifics in mind! Hope you find the great fit too!<br /><br />PS I forgot to mention and equally as important  as the fit...THESE ARE VERY COMFORTABLE!!!!!!! I don't even know I'm wearing them except for the great support I feel!!<br /><br />Thank you Vanity Fair and Amazon!! I'm hooked! No pun intended :)at any retailers including Nordstrom.<br /><br />Needless to say, I'm stocking up on these bras, in each color!

B003CT20WM|4|I have a rather large head and this cap fits well. I have several OD morale patches that look great on the Velcro attachments. Perfect for warm weather exercises or kicking around town. Cheap too, so it won't break you to add it to your hat collection. This is exactly like a Rothco Operator Cap.
B00DE2C7BQ|4|My grandaughter got these and loves them. I just haven't figured what the mustache logo means. Just a trend I guess
B005FPMO22|5|i'm not sure why the color is listed as \\"brown\\" for these.  they are black, white, red and pink... as pictured.  i got these for baby #4 and i've used carter's brand socks with all my kids.  i love the fit, the patterns and colors are always super cute and they stay on well!  oh, and they stretch so you'll likely use them past whatever age range is listed on the packaging.  =)
B00JUW0H3O|3|No tummy control and my boobs are falling out
B00KC0IRLC|1|They looked great and fit great the first time I wore them.  They are not see-through which was just what I wanted.  Silky looking and feeling.  Fleece inside for added warmth.  The second time I wore them they got a bit saggy, it just ripped apart at the seam by the crotch and now has a big hole.  Since they seem to run big and these are not tight fitting at all there was no reason for the hole.  Plus they have all little pilling type things all up and down the legs...all after one wearing.  I wanted to like them, I did on day one.......hated them by day two.
B002PTZN4M|2|The neck closure runs very small and the rest of the costume is large.
B00CUTLUO4|3|love it just ran a little smaller then I expected
B00KB84VM4|5|Like the fit like the hat!
B007FDMPJE|1|Not Hatley quality ...  Rip off !
B007RBE25O|5|Very nice tartan scarf
B00NYZQMPK|5|love it
B00AKSCNT8|5|Great product that does what it claims to do.  Im 5' 8&#34; my waist is a size 36 I weigh 215 lbs and I have football players thighs and gluteus maximus .  These fit great and keep (the boys) in place.  Best of all they completely stopped my chafing.  I order 1 large pair just to see how they fit and if they were going to work for me.  They worked so good I've already ordered 3 more pair.
B009MA7J94|5|good
B00HUUHVFA|2|Poor quality. Worked for its purpose.
B002AQ46C0|5|bien
B00BOTK9TI|5|I got size 3-6 for my 2 moths old (she is 12 lbs) since so many clothes are running small, and I would rather buy items too big. Anyway, they are too big but we are still using it already! Just because those are the best pants ever! Soft, warm, stretchy and have great colors. I'm sure she will be using those for few months. Great buy, would recommend it.  Definitely great baby shower gift.
B00KPV0BLM|3|Pretty Sheer! Can see through them
B00715FGDI|1|This dress looked very nice on the web site but had really nothing : no shape at all, poor fabric... it's a no no - would not recommand it
B00KUTDYE0|3|Super cute but run small. Order the next size up.
B00OMBVROG|3|Love the shirt; however, it's way too small.  I normally wear a medium...so I ordered a medium and it's super snug against me. Like spandex. Hoping to exchange for an XL.
B00YBEMY1E|5|Great shirt.
B00CH5P6IM|5|My eleven year old son wears this often to camp and school and it fits great, looks great, and has a bold clear message that makes him proud.
B0050261ZG|5|My son loved it
B00JUM311E|4|Great brand
B002SZY47K|5|My son wore this for Halloween. It was an awesome joker costume.
B00JQIIKVI|5|This was purchased for my nephed. He liked it!
B00F945WP0|4|I liked this shirt, it tends to run a bit small so make sure to order a size up.
B00GN6CRL0|5|Very soft, great fit (I'm a size 8), stays in place.  Nice weight--not thick or heavy.  Gray color hides dirt & blends with my running shoes.
B002AQ261I|2|I believe I ordered 36/30 as usual, but received 35/30 and washed them before I noticed.  They are really a bit snug for my husband.  Can I still exchange them?
B008ASJO56|5|This was a random purchase while looking at another outfit and now it is one of my favorites!  It looks great and fits more like XS-S, medium would be pushing it I think.  Fits nice and is comfortable in any position!!
B00JL921J4|4|Shirt is very nice and soft. Color is great! Fits very tight even after going up one size.
B004LVOW3K|3|It fit her head as expected but it just looked kind of strange. The colors are cute and it matches the outfit but it just didn't look like I thought it would. Its really big and squarish. Pretty but awkward looking.
B00R0LTNIW|5|Good Socks.
B0088X2II8|5|These leggings are really nice.  Hold their shape really well.  The knit is such that other fabrics don't stick.  They really work to firm the tummy but are still comfortable.  Hard to find so I will try to order more when I can.
B00KJ91Y8Y|2|Sizes run BIG!
B00W7XG1AG|3|The green chevron dress is ugly. The green and white is nothing like the photo. Also when I took the dress out of the bag the tags fell out. Plus there is a big ugly stain as you can see in the picture. Needless to say this dress is being returned for a refund. I specifically bought this dress to go with my neon green chevron yellow box flip flops. The green on the dress wasn't as pretty as the picture. Needless to say I won't buy from them again. I do suspect this green chevron dress was used by someone since the tags weren't attached.<br /><br />The second dress the purple butterflies is a pretty dress. I gave it three stars since I am happy with the purple butterflies dress.
B00EVODA3K|4|Good fit on these at a good price
B003I6UC2Y|5|I love this Metallica shirt. It's a great color with the purple and black.  The fit is great too! I get so many compliments and I would suggest any female get this that likes Metallica! Very happy with purchase! :)
B000J45N9A|5|I had no issues with this item it was perfect and fit correctly. I do recommend them to others so go ahead and buy.
B004WI27JS|2|The dark dye transfers easily to other things, even after the jeans have had been washed three times. My legs, hands, and underwear all turned light blue where the jeans rubbed. They also bleed badly in the washing machine, so be careful to wash only dark clothing in the same load.
B00SKA38RY|4|great
B004BZ9ECA|5|This shirt will show off your lady curves in a classy way. It goes great with any type of bottoms such as shorts, pants or slacks. I love this shirt.
B00AWDE53S|5|It fits and it is just what I expected.  Without  intentionally being abusive to my outdoor clothing, they take a beating.  It's too early to tell but at the present I am completely satisfied with the comfort, fit, warmth, and apparent durability.
B007R1OKNS|5|High quality tee in the softest fabric.  Not too baggy either, didn't swallow up my boyfriend and he likes the heather red fabric.
B009QVCTTY|3|I understand this is not an expensive product, but it really has not held up well with limited use. My daughter used it up pretty quickly to say the least. For the price you pay I suppose it was to be expected. As a side note: the arm rubber bands will snap your kids face if they are not supervised when putting it on.
B00FA9QOGU|5|This shirt was indeed worth the purchase, if I had to say. Women's shirts are typically hard to shop for, as the sizes are different for every brand and whatnot, but I found that the shirt fit even better than I had expected! When I pulled it out of the bag I was wondering if it might be too big, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it had been a perfect sized shirt. When a shirt fits you snugly, you might expect to have to constantly pull it down so it doesn't ride its way up your back/stomach, but this one is nice and long and the sleeves aren't uncomfortable on your arms. The print on the shirt is very large and cute with quite vivid colors, as the picture suggests, and the opening on the top of the shirt is a good size; not too small to irritate your neck and not too big to leave you constantly pulling your sleeves up your shoulder. I have to say that I am very pleased with this buy. If you're a major fan of Cat-Eye Link or Zelda in general, this shirt is an absolutely recommended purchase.
B004ZKR68K|5|My Grandfather was a dapper dresser, he had \\"swagger\\" when the \\"zoot suit\\" was the claim to fame. One of the adages of my Grandmother was \\"always look at a man's feet, you can tell a lot by looking at his feet, if he doesn't take care of his feet, he won't take care of you\\".  So between the 2 of them, they taught the family to dress your best, whatever you have. I have passed that on to my family. Birthdays or holidays, I try to add to their wardrobe and this year I had an idea to make a \\"ready-to-go\\" travel bag. So, a perfect addition were these pattern dress socks. The price and quality and delivery right to my front door...can't be beat! Swagger is alive and well!
B00DNSS6Z2|5|I really love this maxi skirt. It flows with you when you walk. I am a 5ft3 170lb girl and I chose xl. It was a perfect fit. Washes wonderful mine came out fine, few wrinkles but I didn't need to iron it or anything. It is so comfy I am going to buy another color. It's a little pricey but its worth every penny. Go for it!
B00NCA1A4K|5|Fit great and caught them at a great price!!!
B00CFBAROQ|5|comfortable and whisks the sweat away from tender areas so there is no chaffing. I plan on purchasing several more.
B00DYS8XZY|4|It's a little bit long.
B00B7C2WEW|5|I really like the suit. It fit nice and looked a lot more expensive than what I paid. Would really recommend.
B00G10OAKY|2|ORDERED MEN'S.  CAME IN AS WOMEN'S. SO NOW SINCE THEY WERE SMALL AND WOMEN'S WILL HAVE TO WEAR AND RE-ORDER FROM ANOTHER SUPPLIER THE MEN'S THAT WAS INITIALLY ORDERED.
B00PJTAYOO|3|Very pretty bra but the cup size is very large. So pretty still that I kept it but I would def size down
B001FOR4YA|5|This wallet is very nice. My fiance will love it when he opens it for Christmas.  I was very impressed with this product!
B00EBZFXPW|4|Pretty cute.  Very different.  Does run small.  I normally wear a size 2 or 4 but went by sizing chart and the size 6 fit.  Maybe a tad tight but I can lose those 5 lbs and be ok.
B0001VRXEO|5|5.11 produces nothing but quality products. I own these particular pants in khaki, OD, and tundra. Constuction of these pants could not be any better. Very well made and reinforced where it needs to be, knees and rear area. I wear them everyday to work and they have not failed me. I work in a hot, dirty, and hostile enviroment. They are comfortable even in 100 plus degree temperatures. I highly recommend all 5.11 products. Stay away from the imitations.
B00B93VVHS|5|This dress fit PERFECT!!! I ordered it in my usual size XL and it fits me just fine. The material is soft and would look nice with leggings and maybe some riding boots.
B00816PX02|5|Very comfortable
B00857QAY0|5|This sports bra fits well and gives good support for jogging or running.  I recommend this product over an ordinary sport bra.
B00KRHJJGW|5|Good
B00774HCP8|4|Nice cap, just wish it was a little bit larger. I have always had a difficult time finding hats large enough, so I'm not surprised that the large size is a bit snug. But that will help it stay put on bike rides and it won't result in a headache from being too tight. If you have a large head, and always notice this when you try on standard size hats, this will probably work for you.
B00KGVAJX6|2|Quality is good, great washed color but i can't use it, is too big. I always use size 33, it fits more like 34 o 35
B000J6YR9A|3|3 Stars for the full coverage it provides! 1 star for the straps have an overlap of fabric under the part that touches your shoulder, which digs in and hurts, not to mention leaves a mark by the end of the day. When I work out, the girls still jump around as well. It feels like I should have gone a cup size smaller. I don't have the pointiness that others have described. If you can find a way to cushion the strap, and get the right cup size, it's  an ok bra I guess, but I will not buy again, I will try another brand.
B00GFXX8C8|5|great quality love it
B008HQI3FS|4|Got them quick but they look kind of cheap (they weren't expensive) the picture looked nicer than the actual. A little diasapointed but for what I paid they are good.
B00S4G6CNQ|5|Hat fit good, looks nice and is warm
B00IJJHBQK|5|I just spent the weekend with my 4 month old granddaughter. She got to wear the brand new pajamas I had ordered for her. How comfy and adorable she looked! I LOVED the feel of the material. Perfect!
B00KIZ401C|5|Fast shipping, looks awesome. Will definitely be ordering again!! Have gotten alot of compliments!!!
B004A7YLPY|5|this wallet is fantastic. It is made of quality materials and I have been using it for months now and it still looks like brand new.
B008VUQKLY|5|Right size and length.  I could do without the workman pockets and loop and have cargo type pockets, but I won't complain because it is hard to find quality and fit in my size.
B006O1Z496|5|Fine, I use it as my travel wallet
B00P6EB21G|5|Best Jeans!
B00LGDZKVE|5|Bought this for my 2 and half year old. She is tall and wear age 3 clothing usually. It is large. The colours and design are great. The fabric is more like a leotard than swimsuit. Very comfortable and seems to hold up well to pools and sea water. Shipping took long!
B00L944IPY|1|Cheap material used to construct this dress. I wouldn't be buying from this designer again. The dress is also short. It's made from some flimsy spandex material and is definitely not a maxi dress.
B00LIVF2EY|5|I love this shirt!! It fits well and seems to be good quality! I haven't washed it yet so I don't know how well it holds up there! It's perfect for that little something extra with your outfit!
B00JHNP6KK|5|1) The fit is really awesome I have junk in my trunk, and I have oaks of righteousness of thighs.  It felt like some plumbers butt might be there, but tighten the drawstrings and you are good to go.<br />2)  Wear some aviators and walk around the beach and look at everyone stare at you, desiring you.  It is great.<br />3)  Feel like a true American.<br />4)  I feel like these could even be worn as underwear, not just swimwear.
B00GDFVHWQ|5|Bad bacteria Bros
B00HY579N0|5|Love it. Great fit. Great tie. Gray deal.
B0002TW0JS|2|Be warned that this particular package of gold-toe fluffies are mercerized. This isn't just some nostalgia for the good-old days of higher-quality gold-toes that so many talk about in these reviews.  The package is actually labelled as mercerized cotton.  I bought another pack in the same order with a different color which were soft & normal.  I had to immediately throw this pack into the donation bin.
B010FMO8NM|5|Very nice.
B00DIXJG74|4|Love the fit of this dress, it's very comfortable and classic. The color is as show and the material is quality.
B005J812DC|5|Its great for a moody baby who wants to take their clothes off.  The can take off a piece still be dress and still look cute too. It is really nice,gives a mom lots of options and the cotton is really soft to the skin too.
B00JQGJTJC|4|I was a little nervous when I opened the package.  It looked, quite honestly, cheap.  The collar looked flimsy.  The pocket is ornamental, just for show.  I clearly was not wearing this as a dress shirt.<br /><br />However, the size is good.  It's admittedly a little more form-fitting than I'm used to, but I normally wear traditional dress shirts.  I rolled up the sleeves (in half and then half again so that the contrasting material shows) and didn't bother to tuck.<br /><br />I have to say, I get lots of compliments when I wear this shirt.  It's not what I was expecting but it turns out that I am pleasantly surprised.  I would indeed order this shirt again in a heartbeat.
B007L4XD7K|4|Like other reviewers have said, it is huge. I generally wear a size 14/18 dress (depending on the bust) and this could probably fit two of me. However, the top does adjust and worn with a corset, it looks just fine - like very fluffy chemise. The cloth is thin but not see-through. Oh, and it's pretty short. I'm 4'11'' and I've still got a couple of inches of ankle to show.
B00IDI14EW|2|Not satisfied
B0045LY1NW|3|Nice warm and thick but just bigger than expected
B001EH9LWG|4|I love leopards spots and was unable to locate pajama pants anywhere until I found these, just by luck I guess. I love them, they are light flannel material and are very comfortable.
B004XMX9OU|5|I have always liked the fit and feel of the Leggs products. The sheer energy variety seems to be my favorite because my legs really do get a sensation of being messaged. The product wears well after repeated washing, but they are susceptible to runs if you happen to snag them.
B00FRIFRT4|3|Nice looking piece. Too small in bust. Straps should be thicker for size...
B001D9ZU0W|1|I'm not sure if the makers of this mask were just lazy and didn't want to hire an artist for a new mask and they just used an old one or the artist was just bad. The face is not even close and the skin color is all wrong. It seems like they said it might be Obama just because it is of an African American man.<br />If you wore this to a party do you think people would say oh that guy is Obama or just some black guy. A good characiture still resimbles the origional some. I can understand your point about it maybe being a characiture of Obama. But it is just an ulgy mask that feels racist to me too. That has nothing to do with Obama its a offinsive mask.<br /><br />And yes if I ran across this mask not labeled as Obama I probably would not of written but I still would of thought wow that mask is offensive! I only made a review because they said it was Obama and \\"they\\" actually don't all look a like.
B00K1PTU00|4|Fits a little smaller than expected.
B00B6EESH0|2|hi!  the jacket is nice and fits my husband but after a week of wearing it, it ripped on the back top part of the jacket.  Not very good material I suppose.
B005VEGD6K|5|I was very pleased with this product. It is very pretty, I bought for a co-worker and she loved it.
B008OR51NC|5|Fits with room to grow in for our 3.5 year old who is 39 inches tall.
B00BBXN5KW|5|Any items I get with Duck Commander  or any thing that has to do with them is a great product. My family enjoys the shows and all the clothes and other things we get. There are of good value and we all enjoy wearing them. I tell all my friends about them but they know all ready.
B0083QLPY8|4|I was very pleased with the extender. It saved me from bra shopping  which I do not enjoy. They are soft to the skin.
B00S45Z850|5|This top is just as pictured with lace from the cuffs to the neckline along the top of the sleeves and shoulders. Snaps at the crotch make it an easy wear item that adds a classy look to jeans or a skirt without losing comfort.
B00BB8Y0BK|4|Good
B00U7NORFO|4|As expected. Hooks on front don't always stay closed. Would buy again.
B003NA4M1C|4|Cute shirt. Fits well, good quality
B00816O4IE|5|Received different colors from expected but extremely comfortable - don't ride up.  Good price but would prefer to receive colors as shown.
B00FB759SA|5|It's was exactly what I needed
B00LGWVSQQ|5|OUR GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THIS FOR HER NEW AMERICAN GIRL DOLL!  GREAT PRICE TOO!
B00TXVLC9U|5|Jury out until washed
B0097FJQJA|5|This item was a great buy. It's warm and fits nicely. It's worth every penny.. It kept me warm all winter!!!!
B00488478Q|5|No problems with delivery, came on time in perfect condition and as described. I am small size and it fits perfectly. The cotton fabric is very good quality as well. It looks wonderful on the back, very sexy totally love it !
B00GHQT75U|5|Love it
B00M0Z48L0|5|Good
B006MR1BL2|5|Great coat, got many complements. No matter how cold, the Sondria coat keeps me warm and at the same time elegant!
B0068XVCEG|5|cool belt
B00M37MZWO|5|Love it!
B000OPGSUW|5|these under wear fit very comfortable. better than expected.
B000PJYLT2|5|fits perfectly .. she wore the dress for easter sunday and was simply beautiful .. loved how it actually fit her
B001C3YQHW|5|I have not taken this top off since it arrived. It is EXACTLY the size i expected from a 'Small', the colour is great, the writing is clear, the quality is great and best of all - PEOPLE LOVE IT!!!!!! If you're a fan of The Office, just get it. Don't think twice.
B00ACIFP64|5|Will buy more
B00PPT2WV6|5|Awesome gift! My Packer fan fiance LOVED IT!
B003O4VA1C|1|My boyfriend has a thing for elves, but these were ugly and gross. I looked like a hobbit or something. Bad, bad hobbit!!! ;-)
B00NL100EG|5|Very flattering suit.  Appears to be well made.  Have not had the opportunity to use it yet.
B007T778UM|4|Just got a pair today. Exactly what I wanted but X-Large was too small. They are usable, so I will keep them, but the back runs up on me when I left my legs. A size larger than you wear MIGHT be the answer. Otherwise very happy.
B00BB8YBCS|5|Shorter in length than what I would like bit all in all my 6 year old loves it! Great price!
B00FU6QNC8|4|These are super cute and soft!  I ordered size 0-3 months, but one onesie was 0-3 mos and the other was 3-6 mos.  Not a big deal, but I was expecting the same size.  These also seem to be sized a little differently than another Hudson Baby onesie I ordered.  Overall, love em & can't wait for my baby to come to try them out!
B00NHMK5US|5|My daughter loves it. Everyone loves it....  Buying two more to gift to my best friends kids
B000BJDPM0|4|The leather is very soft and smooth. It is rather slim, which is perfect for what my husband wanted. It has many compartments and can accommodate many cards. The slots are a bit tight, but should loosen up with use. The best part is that the &#34;insert&#34; where ID cards go is attached to the wallet! This portion is not in danger of falling out of the wallet and losing the contents thereof. We expect the wallet to last a while.
B00IUFZMLE|2|Very cute but sizing was on the small side. Unable to get much wear out of it.
B002BB586C|5|I wore this to the hospital to give birth to my baby boy and every nurse commented on how cute it was. This is a hospital approved gown (snaps, ties etc) so I was allowed to use it. I loved it!! It was so perfect and made me feel cute when I was in a hospital bed for days. I wish I had ordered two!! Love, love, love this!!
B00I0CWKGM|5|Great shirt
B00781CR1Y|2|Cute design but very baggy on the sides. I usually wear a medium and I chose to get a large since it was made of cotton and would shrink. After I washed it, it was still too big. If I could do it again, I probably would have gotten a small.
B00902Z5EA|5|Purchased as a gift. They fit well and keep the legs warm when out in the cold. Would buy again!
B00AMYDZZQ|1|I ordered what i thought said medium ladies socks. I am a size 7 and these socks were huge. Way to big to wear, and more for a man or a size 11 or larger for a lady.  Very disappointed.
B002BP2K28|5|I decided to buy a shirt for my friend. He likes Johny Cash so I bought this shirt. This shirt fit him great and it looks exactly how it does online. He loves it
B00SL64SXK|2|A little small in the butt. Also, old-person looking with super wide pant legs.
B00186ZHYE|5|Easy to put on and take off. So cute. Great for lite boys.  No fighting to gets son to wear them
B00JGUFJDS|5|Toddler loves the bubbles
B00450GLWW|4|I use amazon for purchases about 25 times every year.  This provider took a week just to send item.  So it took two weeks to receive it.  That's not acceptable.
B00AYDUPWQ|5|perfect fit, loved them. very comfortale
B00KZZ77II|5|Gorgeous coat, gorgeous color. Fits well and looks very professional. 5'4, 125 and 6 works great. Sleeves are a little long.
B00TQ5EKYC|5|Got these running socks for my wife.  Since she has relatively small feet, she has a difficult time finding running socks that are both wicking and fit correctly.  These socks do both and she was very pleased with the results!
B00HRN21PA|5|love it so much the clothe is vey nice and the color is so pretty...
B00429EF5G|5|Very comfortable, skinny like I like em, and the clips/fasteners hold great onto my jeans.<br />Highly recommend, especially for the price!
B0020B5ZVQ|3|I'm a seamstress and bought this for a client for her to wear under her wedding gown.  She's petite and curvy, measures a 32DD.  This was very long and the cups weren't quite right for her figure.  It is a very pretty bustier, and would be great for a tall and thin figure.
B0055X1OAW|4|It does the job. However it does ride up if your wearing a dress. Other then that it works fine.
B003299WUU|5|Very nice. Came in time for Holloween. Thank You
B00NMW23C6|4|Well , i think is somewhat large for me because I ordered M sizes , but I very like it , no problem with that
B001DTYKK8|5|I'm very happy about my purchase of this coat.  The LARGE size I ordered was sized perfectly.  The quality was very good.  The leather was soft and the inner lining is very warm.  The discounted price was a great buy.
B0002WV78K|5|Just wanted to note for all women who have to wear suits to work... this shirt is so soft and light, yet professional, its perfect under a suit! The bright colors are nice too! Dress it up with some silver, and your a stylish lady for a low price!
B0046RXDEI|5|Awesome  for the price and my costume  was a success!
B001VEID94|5|I bought them for my 19 year old son.  He loves his new socks.
B00CA4S8B2|2|Returned these--waist was tighter than others I own in same size and fit. Material way too thin ad felt like it would stretch out quickly.
B00443XJUM|2|Although I don't snag it on anything while putting it on or taking it off, and nothing else snags in the washer or dryer, this has gotten snags all over it from the first wearing, and mainly on the back and sleeves.  It does keep me warmer though, so I'll give it two rather than just one star, but I wouldn't buy them again.  I'd expect more for the price paid.
B00348SYUS|5|It has become very difficult to find shirts that fit me well, either brick & mortar or online.  Most XXXLT shirts fit like a hefty bag around the waist.  I have a 54&#34; chest and a 38&#34; inch waist (on a good day), so I am no fashion model, but still, I don't need the extra gut fabric.  That being said: this shirt fit just right!
B002FVWJT2|5|Excellent product and excellent seller, from Venezuela recommend it!
B00QTKTQOQ|5|nice item.....will buy again
B00LU2Q4S4|5|I am surprised how much I love this skirt.  The weight i perfect.  I'm currently wearing a cast and need somthing I can pull over my head to put on.  Becuase I'm on crutches, the skirt can't be too long.  The style of the waist band allows the lenght to be easily adjusted.  My only problem is that I'm not sure which pattern I'm going to select when I order the next one.
B00QHUXC70|4|Very surprised with how nice this swimsuit is... It looks just like a real one. The bottoms are on the small side but nothing awful or super uncomfortable.
B00E60ISFY|5|This camisole fits nicely helping to support those areas that need extra support such as your tummy. It's a nice material that is very comfortable to wear all day long. I am very pleased with this purchase.
B00GMO7Y9I|3|Poor material. a bit overpriced to be honest.
B0088X2IE2|5|Somewhat larger than I expected, but then maybe I'm not as big as I think I am. Love the quality, softeness, unbunchiness of the product, and the price was a great value. Will be ordering more!
B008G79LPY|5|i bought the Paxton rain defender as well.  This medium weight sweatshirt fits a little smaller through the body, sleeve and hip....but in a way, no matter as my daughter has already confiscated it.  soft fleece inside.  will have to see how it stands up to washing re: softness of the fleece.  but i'm glad to be back in cotton rather than polyfleece.  and i know carhartt will last.
B003G5Q9TM|5|I'm 5'3&#34; and these socks go all the way to my mid thigh and even more. I usually roll them down so that they are not too long. They are very warm and fit perfectly. Love them.
B003CMWX0S|5|We gave these socks to our son and grandson who are avid ice fishermen.  They claim that their feet have never been as warm and comfortable as they are now with their Carhartt socks.
B000FGVWLU|5|It's a hat
B002IF61W6|5|Costume was very nice quality for the price and came with everything you needed.... No need to purchase leggings and hat separately. Sizes seemed appropriate. The costume was shipped quickly too. Overall, was very pleased.
B0066618BW|1|I hate these gloves. They retain moisture and they don't keep your hands warm at all. Also they make your hands smell like dirty socks. I wish I read the reviews before I bought them but I didn't think I had to because Carhartt is usually a good brand. Please don't buy these gloves you will regret it. I am sending them back and I hope to get a full refund. Definitely not worth the price.
B00BYMQQJM|4|This is lycra fabric which I love!! Soft, fitting... I am short and round. The shoulder straps were a little long for me. So I had to order a size smaller. The length works for almost any height
B009S0S44W|5|These socks are very fun bright colors and fit extremely well and they feel really good on my feet.<br />Delivery was very quick
B00IPXZ91E|5|Very nice! Well worth the money! Not the best but certainly not the worst either!
B00FMRU1N2|5|I LOVE this shirt! I am a size 6 and I ordered a size M and it for perfectly. It wasn't skin tight and it wasn't incredibly loose. It fit great! Just be careful the fabric is very thin so it can get damaged easily if not taken care of.
B004YN2KW0|5|This is a very pretty little dress.  I am 5'4\\" and 145 lbs.  I purchased the large size and it is comfortable with room to spare without being baggy.  The dress is quite clingy but in a form-fitting and flattering way.  The back has elastic running across the top that allows room for a larger bust (I am 36 DD). I am very pleased with this - it's cute, summery, flattering and at a great price.
B009NQ6V5U|5|AHH. So much love. They're comfortable, shiny, and after digging through comments and reviews and deciding to go with the majority and order a size up to be careful, they fit perfectly too. Super happy with these.
B0081PNNT6|4|this item is so cute and seems to be made well. it is a gift for the season so not sure how it will hold up to washing but looks sturdy. The sweater will need to be worn with an undershirt or onesy so it is not itchy.
B004PJC744|3|These are a tad tight around the waist & buttocks. I knew Dickies ran small but this was still a shock considering I am only a size 12/13, the pair I purchased is a 14 which I thought would give me the roominess I desired. I like that in a frigid place like New England, these were good for me on a night of 42 degrees with a hefty wind chill. On colder nights I wished I was able to wear a pair of leggings underneath them. The jury is still out on whether I would purchase them again...
B00AIVXSHS|5|These were a great hit with my grandson. At first he thought it was the \\"costume\\" and was a little disappointed until he saw the web wings. He was so happy and looks forward to getting ready for bed every night. The fit was spot on. Great product and a lot of fun for the little spiderman. Note: I got the costume (with muscles) for his Christmas gift and it is all he has worn since then.
B00UMUOWC0|5|Love, love, love these bras!<br />Perfect weight, pretty colors and if you wear the straps crossed they are perfect for sleeveless blouses.
B003ULNBK2|4|I've got quite a few high end fedoras but wanted something more casual while keeping things stylish and having something that was no fuss (I roll this hat up and throw it in my pocket. Unthinkable with a fedora!)<br />Also, I was unsure if I'd manage the same Peaky Blinders level of cool so didn't want to break the bank.<br />This hat was the right call all around. Inexpensive, stylish and functional too.<br /><br />One thing to consider though is the fit. I'm a size 7 3/4 or a 59cm. This hat is labeled a Large - 7 1/2 - 60cm but fits as much as 3cm big. Still works but I should have gone with the Medium.
B002SB3MHC|1|I hate this scrub so much. The material is soooooo cheap and thin. Also the size it totally off. its too big. I bought a small and it was so big that not even the xsmall will fit.  I absolutely hate this product.
B00H8VWKGG|5|Very thin, great for a cool summer evening. Color was as expected and the fit was great.
B00HK7DTIQ|4|Quality is good. waiting, when baby will have the same size to wear it. I like this combination of colors. really good.
B00EQYHYEQ|5|Most soft and comfortable underwear ever!! Practically feels invisible. Excellent for any occasion.
B001OV92PS|5|This hat is great!  I bought this as a Christmas gift for a friend of mine who is a huge MASH fan and he loves it!  Hat is well made and the stitching is very well done.  Great job!!
B0085OCLF0|4|I like it, but u should buy it in a bigger size than u need, because its very small and skinny
B00M3UK01Y|4|love this shirt!
B004D92R28|5|My daughter (about 5'3&#34;, 120 lbs) loves this.  Yes it is a bit baggy on her but she can wear it comfortably.  I have the Sazac tabby cat pajamas and I love them too.  I would say the Sazac kigurumi is awesome.
B00E87833W|5|i love this jacket.  Great fit and design.  I have seen it featured in fashion blogs.  I highly recommend it.
B001I1KDWU|5|Awesome
B00GP6OW5C|5|It looks and feels like a swimsuit. My first thought that it would be uncomfortable and too hot. I was wrong. It's comfy. It's true to size. It does hang off shoulder a bit. I had to keep pulling up on shoulder. Overall, I'm glad I found this one.
B00MITXHHE|5|Purchased as a gift for my son, and it is very handsome on him.  One of his favs.
B00C5GKESK|5|Yes the back is sheer...but it is hot and ready for Carnival 2015 in the U.S.V.I. baby!!!  Come on down! Jan 3, 2015!!
B005CZUS6Y|1|Too small,  for the size I order, I ordered large and it feels like a small, I wont order again.
B00OTS26WE|5|It's good
B005Z2LVP6|2|Very bad quality, the metal/wire in the rim hurts my hears when I am putting these on. There is no padding; cloth over wire-frame.<br /><br />Does it protect my ears, I guess so - better than bare ears.
B001U8HML6|5|I don't often write a review but I must comment on these gloves, the product deserves recognition!  I have a hedge of barberry bushes...those of you with this shrub know this is equivalent to millions of thorns!  Whenever I prune or weed in and around the shrubs I am left with painful reminders for many days afterward.  I've always chalked it up to the price I had to pay for loving this thorny shrub.  However, today (my first time using these gloves) I was pruning, weeding in and under the shrub, and grabbing ahold of branches with reckless abandon and NOT ONE thorn even pricked the gloves!!!  I usually get excited about new garden tools but this is the first time I've been so excited about a pair of gloves.  Awesome!
B00JRE36AQ|2|I only had one problem with it, I ordered a 34L and 32W but they gave me 34W and 32L....So I wouldn't recommend this...
B0026OTSA6|5|I´ve been looking for this model for months, cause I lost couple I had before, arrived before I expected to Thailand with a personal note that made me feel I got it in a face to face purchase in a warmly attended shop
B0052B66VE|2|I bought this dress for a summer wedding - was really looking forward to a dress that was dressy and comfortable. instead what I got was a sheer dress, completely unwearable to any event. I was very disappointed
B00JHZSWAY|2|Super cute. Bottoms fit but top way to small. I have dds. I got a xl.
B00D41BQSM|5|It was perfect and my teen grandson loves it.  The quality is top notched and it washes up great...easy care.<br />Thank You<br />Colleen D
B00DT4R4KS|4|Bought for a xmas gift for my Dad, I ordered a 2xl and they seem rather large, however for what he wants them for I think it will work fine.  Plus, I always expect slight shrinkage with anything like that.  Overall the fabric is great, they are not insulated but are super soft for a pair of men's bibs I think.  Excited to give them at Christmas this year. Thanks!
B0035EPTEA|5|This hat is more beautiful than in the picture. I cant wait for my baby girl to wear it. Its pure white and the brim is perfect for hiding baby's face from the sun!
B006WDFLVW|5|It was quite lovely.  Thank you for the lovely dress that was absolutely PERFECT for our Flower Girl.  She loved it a whole lot.  The material was of great quality.  The fit was also perfect.  Thank you!!
B00UBX7YD2|1|shirt is really nice but way too small even though I ordered the shirt a size larger.
B00CMQ9JBQ|3|okay
B0025FMNGC|5|perfect fit and he loved it
B004R7PT9O|5|These are the most comfortable and flattering pants. Stretchy material that just plain doesn't wrinkle. I like them so much I bought them in 3 colors. In jeans, I can often wear a size 5. But in these pants, I buy a 7 and it's borderline too tight. So just keep that in mind before ordering.
B005GYGEWS|5|Love
B00FJ1TTXO|3|it's ok,but Space is a little small purse
B00U63UU24|5|Amazing swimsuit! I was nervous about the sizing but everything worked out! It definitely shows off the curves! Love love love it! I can't wait to go to Miami!
B00HQ35RV6|5|Love this shirt! I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  I will be ordering from this seller again.
B007RBTJPW|5|Wonderful top.  Very pleased with the colour, style and fit.  Comes out of the washing machine like new.  This top is so good I now have four.
B002HWS45C|5|Fits very well and warm!
B003FPZFZ2|5|Very comfortable
B00J7MBLGO|1|Don't buy this it is not as the picture the skirt is not like the picture and the top isn't even finished what a waste of time wtf
B00W311HWE|5|Living across the Ohio River from Louisville, This black hat is gonna be perfect for the derby!  It fits perfectly and it's stylish.  The Brim of the hat is stiff and not to floppy, would go perfect with any dress with stripes,  polkadots, or floral print.  The head is sheer with the nice flower in the front and simply elegant  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.
B00PBGW22M|5|This is not an actual sweater. It is a long sleeve shirt but I love it. I got many compliments on it and it was very comfortable.
B0053P26ZY|1|I ended up returning this costume because the head piece doesn't match the online photo nor the packaging insert photograph. I called the manufacturer about it and all I got was an apology that they have cheapened the headpiece.  What you will receive is a headpiece that has nine snakes with no fangs or tongues visible. The gold decorations are smaller and there are more of them to compensate for the lesser amount of snakes. Bummed about the headpiece because the rest of the costume was pretty great!
B005CSNWGY|5|FABULOUS
B00FN0GFX8|5|i'm actually very thin, but i still find this sweater to fit well given that it has that &#34;too large sweater look.&#34;  i love the design, it's a thick texture expected from a sweater, very comfortable, and stretches if you need it to.
B006V76F78|4|I wanted longer swim shorts to match the tan line that I get when wearing my regular clothing.  With these swim shorts the tan line is met and they are comfy.
B00JVN8M2K|5|Comfort meets fashion!  Very flattering.
B00MIGN222|5|Super shiney, super stretchy(comfortable) super hot!!  I am 5'7' with athletic build, pants are alittte shorter than I'd like, then a little big at the waist, but so awesome feeling I don't care (:
B00M8YSVNY|5|Great vest for the price, runs small so my hubby is a large and we ordered an xxxl
B008JHV0QE|5|Will be getting more of these in different colors
B00I8TZ8K2|4|Good  nice
B00NFXQEYU|2|I think these socks are super cute - but they run way too small - for me and my 12-year old daughter. We are not large people, and they're just too tight around the calf and don't feel comfortable to wear all day (unless your calves are the size of your ankles). I too did not think I could be disappointed in socks, but I won't be buying any more of these. Bummer.
B00J4ICMUU|1|This shirt claims to be &#34;fitted&#34; but isn't. Its cut as if the person was 500lbs+. Unfortunately I already washed and pressed this shirt so I couldn't return it. Buyer beware, unless you are &#34;husky&#34; (code name for fat) don't buy this shirt and expect to like it.
B001E22BAU|2|The costume was very cute BUT it was much shorter than showed on the model. So short it was unwearable.
B0013TSYRS|5|The hat is for adults. great wide size and nicely cloth material (looks real not any low grade hat) which you can wear it anytime for it is very comfortable.<br />Only one minor issue, the package i received was a bit damaged which hatch the hat in sides. thankfully for its fabric good quality i can bent it easily to its exact position.
B003E8ETUM|5|I got this to match my Medicine Woman Indian costume and am very pleased with it.  The colors are a perfect turquoise and coral, not red.  For the price I paid for it, I am very happy with it.  Delivery was faster then quoted at checkout.  Cant wait to wear it!
B009E32430|4|Either my head is too large for most hoodies or they make them way too small.<br />The fit is perfect (medium for me) and I really like the finish on the &#34;armor&#34; and emblems. The zipped up hoodie fits my head poorly though, squashing my nose IF I'd close it up fully.<br /><br />But in general I rarely actually pull up hoods anyway.
B001JYIOZY|5|It was exactly what I wanted!  It's perfect, in all aspects.  I will make similar purchases in the future, for sure.
B00CSS7ZL4|4|The dress is beautiful as in the pic but the size runs a bit small,probably one size lower.The stretch material helps, but the look is compromised.
B001A3Y8AE|5|just the right snugyness
B00N3K2DW2|4|At same in photo and good quality
B0037TVRQC|5|Excellent quality & color.  Definitely NOT a typical cheap T-shirt.
B00OT4DGPY|1|Poor Quality had Rip in top of hat
B00QL1SK4U|5|I like the colors and the quality of the cloth. This is great for summer and I used it during Zumda.
B00CRBYBFU|5|thin but great
B004XMZZK6|5|Awesome shirt, very happy with product!
B00ODMAZDS|4|I loved the jacket itself but the arms are a little to small for plus size - can't wear anything bulky at all underneath
B00FJ5LI3O|4|I purchased to replace a older aluminum wallet that had been less than satisfactory (not a Sharkk).  The Sharkk is a little larger than the old one and seems to be better made.  The locking mechanism works very well and does not pop open when dropped.
B00C1C02PI|5|Light weight fits great high quality!!
B00TQ7BX5O|5|This is the cutest little outfit, very pleased ..
B00K345GFC|5|Awesome dress!! Gorgeous!
B00OHZES3O|1|Request permission to return.  Ridiculously small!!
B00DSNO2DW|5|This is a great jacket for this price! Amazing deal. My son actually likes it too. Just got yesterday- but seems great
B0079RV22W|4|I am pleased with the quality of this dress/top, but I do have a couple complaints it is a one size fits all (I don't understand for the life of me why) the fit on the body was good, I am 5'8 the length was to short for a dress but can be used as a top with tights, the sleeve were huge looks like almost the same amount of fabric as the dress.<br />But over all with adjustment to the sleeves I am pleased with the purchase
B00LPTCA8A|5|This is a really cute shirt! It fits me well. It has a loose, cap sleeve style which I didn't expect. I thought it'd have more of a classic t-shirt fit.
B00NB8XV9U|5|Really quick shipping and the product was very well made..
B00EI8TBQY|4|Enjoyed the fit, the look and the quality.  If you are looking for a &#34;loose&#34; look this is not the one for you.  It fits smooth and neat, easy to wear a shirt underneath the sweater but the item is not bulky and super loose.  Love the brightness of the sweater.
B00S7ZHIV4|5|This is for the new baby coming.  It is too too cute and I am sure it is going to work perfect.
B00DAMVD06|1|This shirt surprised me by having the Marvel logo on it and being so poorly made. The fabric was way thinner than expected. The symbol wasnt centered in the middle of the shirt but instead off to the side a little. It was wide and short. Nothing like the picture suggests. I gave it away. Smh. Not happy with this purchase at all. Now Im reluctant to buy anything else with the Marvel logo on it.
B004WSD8ZA|4|Nice material. Comfortable fit. No complaints. I will probably order another pair. Nice for everyday wear and adequate for dressier occasions.
B007O1WX1W|5|he liked it
B00OVTYHEQ|5|Really cute! My sister lives foxes and there's not much stuff that's made for little girls with foxes and this could be considered gender neutral.
B004K3X40G|5|Thank you!
B00KJAUD5S|4|Good  quality but seems to run large. Returned and got quick refund.
B001NPUCU4|5|Great jacket, great fit.  Not terribly heavy, but a good outer layer in fall or winter.
B0044FOVXE|5|People who buy porkpie hats have no taste, are generally ugly to begin with, and are not discerning enough to purchase this. This is a very subtle hat-- it's not in-your-face, &#34;oh look! I'm suddenly a newsie from 1917!&#34; It's modern, in both influence and styling, and it looks natural, so long as you wear it to the side ever-so-slightly.<br /><br />no one will associate you for wearing a &#34;porkpie hat.&#34; I've worn hats like this from big name designers who sell $400 denim pants, and trust me, this is up there with 'em.
B007JFERMG|5|Bought it for my son and he loves it wears it to school all the time and he says his friends are jealous.
B00B182A8U|5|When I saw the claim that this bra keeps you cool I dismissed it, but it's true.  This bra is comfortable and cute.  I was constantly having to re-adjust my old bras, so I bought several new styles at once and of all the ones I got, this is easily my favorite and I already find myself wearing it more often than the others.  I always took my bras off the second I walked in the door because they were so uncomfortable, but I almost forget I'm wearing this one.  It also has good lift and holds everything in place.  Great purchase!
B00MX78PZA|5|i love them. they went perfect with my joker costume
B00K5P647I|5|Beautiful dress, neat and sweet.
B00KGGYIVU|5|Fit great thanks
B00E42HC8I|4|cute and go quality
B00JJ8E8ZM|3|Still in one piece.
B002LLW4D2|1|I would not recommend this costume to anyone. The quality is very poor; pants had no elasticity around the hips or even a waist-band at all for that matter - it was as if they just cut the material right off at the ends. The headband and belt weren't bad, but the gloves were terrible - felt like they would fall apart immediately; wasn't sew together even remotely well. The shape of the fit was nothing like the picture - and just to qualify this review, I look pretty similar to the picture. Needless to say, I was unsatisfied with the product and returned it immediately. I will say this is the first halloween costume I've ever purchased so if this level of quality is normal, I apologize for having unrealistic expectations.
B0009MZYIM|5|These are great socks, especially if your on your feet all day
B000OT9QXO|5|Love these jeans! Fit great, stretch well, a  tad bit long, but I love them!
B00P45994E|5|I love this little pouch! Well made & so fun!
B0052BAMQ4|5|I'm a size 4 and border a size 6 at times. I'm 5'8&#34; weight 125 with a 27&#34; waist and 36&#34; hips.  I also have a long torso.  The size small fits great without making me feel too bulky. I can wear a pair of leggings or workout pants easily underneath these. The only thing is I have the shoulder adjustment set as long as it will go to fit my long torso. The length of the legs are great and fit over work boots as well as my light flat shoes without looking like high waters or too long that I'm tripping over them. They are made of cotton with a little spandex and are very soft and comfortable with enough weight to them that they are durable and can take a beating. I use these for work but have also had girls at the grocery store stop me to ask where I got them. They look really cute if you just want to wear a white tank top under them and run errands.  They've got lots of good pockets and straps to fit a hammer and other tools.  I absolutely love these. They are my favorite pair of overalls.  I highly recommend them
B0076R6LX0|5|fits as expected
B003XDTR28|4|Well made, liked the petite length, but it was tighter through the hips and waist than the Docker Ideal pant style that I usually buy.  I had to return them because they were too constricting.
B00CHHCKXY|5|Just great! It fits my son as I expected. The tissue appears to be of good quality. I hope it keeps its original color after washing.
B00B484TIQ|2|This product image is very deceiving. The material is kinda silky and shiny it fits well though but i dont like the material of it at allll
B00614ICTK|1|Not what I expected at all.
B0052B8A5Y|5|Great costume! Has everything you need to pull off any pirate or captain hook costume.(does not come with wig) Quality materials and construction.
B00A7QMTIS|5|Very good.fits perfect.would rec to any one for the money.shipped very good..........covers the face perfect.doesn't matter how cold out it works
B00UIDQT5O|5|Love it
B00XLSXMPS|2|I really don't like it
B004XW9Y6M|5|This is an excellent item, very comfy and keeps me warm. Anytime I where &#34;The Reaper&#34; logo in public, I end up having a conversation with someone about the show. I am proud to wear SAMCRO in public.
B00W1BH8NS|4|It fits great everywhere except the top of the sleeves I'm going to try to fix it somehow because it's really pretty
B00SNMXQE4|3|a bit too tight. But material is some what stretchy, so that helps. Button part is not flowing, it's a bit too tight. But the skirt is nice. Just order a bigger size than you normally would.
B00ARDCES6|5|Soft mittens are so helpful to keep baby from scratching herself.  These are really soft and do work!  They are so cute for our little granddaughter.  Love them!
B00N1LH4VI|4|Great color, nice fit...
B003G5UE0W|5|I bought these for my wife who has been struggling to find socks that actually go all the way up her thigh.  She loves them!  I bought a few pairs of them for her and she wears them all the time now.
B00RVWKCJO|5|Beautiful little dress, elegant and good quality.
B000EW94LU|4|These are very strange. I like them and I hate them all at once. They do tuck you in all the way, but they are incredibly hard to get on. They are not \\"sheer\\" like you might think, either...of course, they are heavier than most sheer panty hose because they tuck you in so tightly.   Don't dismiss them - they are great under a thin dress that shows bumps and bulges - there are no bumps and bulges with these hose!
B00PYWJ1CM|5|nice quality.  MADE IN USA
B00IJJDS58|4|Fits well
B00FH7C5RC|5|good quality,good fit. exelent dress. strongly recommend it.you can use this dress for event as well for casual wear. thanks
B00BJPL7OS|5|Great t-shirt, I get compliments about it when I wear it.
B00EVJHQN0|5|Daughter loves them, BUT after three gentle washes and hung dry - my kid &#34;mysteriously&#34; ripped a hole in them in the middle shin area but i think that may have been her freakish 8yr strength :)  j/k
B00IUB2XZG|4|Fits the wife just fine, she is petite. But the strange arm band things that come with it are way too big for her tiny arms. They fit her legs...
B005LIIVHK|5|Love this bra. It's got a bit of lift, without feeling like a flotation device. Highly recommend buying this bra!
B00E3S2V66|4|They are like sized for like a 12 - 15 year old girl or a very small lady.<br />but they are super cool I wish they fit me :(
B00BMRRGH0|5|It is well done and elegant at a great price.
B0041LQXQO|4|As advertised it's a little small on my 7 3/4&#34; head, but for most people it will be great. Warmth is exceptional.
B009GM4MBQ|2|These were nothing like I expected. The quality of the material was nice, but not a good choice for this garment. It was sheer when I bent over or knelt down but they weren't too tight. The crotch gusset was also awkward. Over all the pants were  a good idea, but not well executed in their over ll design.
B00X9U9SW4|2|Tunic- this is more like a tunic to wear with leggings. I bought this for work but I could never wear something *so short to work. I will be wearing it with stretch leggings and boots in the Fall *maybe.
B0081F1EME|5|Purchased for my 9-year-old.  The fit runs just a bit on the large side, but that's okay as he can grow into them.  The quality is good and the fabric has a decent weight.  They hold up well after washing.
B0038MM7DU|1|The last button was at my belly button.  Way too short.  Thought the customer service people are great and quick to help out and return the product.  I must need to look for tall shirts.
B00JWGUCZ6|5|Just as expected, good quality. works well for the purpose I have in mind.
B00B1C3E8Q|5|excellent, very good, would recommend without hesitation
B00O2E0UV4|5|Nice Fit.  Good Quality
B00TG2JYFA|5|For $16.99 you can't argue it.  I'm 5'4, 170lbs and I got the XL.  I have a big bottom but it fit, snug of course but always expected.  The top was perfect also, I'm a 36B.
B007TIRO5A|5|My man loved this.  It fit nice and looked sexy.  He was soo delighted to see this on me.  I normally don't buy online items without a lot of reviews to go off of, but I'm glad I picked this out and everything turned out great.
B00VB04HDY|5|It is so soft and comfortable!  Fits perfectly over all my spare parts:  eye glasses and hearing aids.  Too bad with all the bills associated with breast cancer et al, I couldn't afford more.  Thank you!
B0072ELQ0A|5|This is an adorable, well made outfit that I think is cute for a boy or a girl.  There are some pink pigs, but lots of other farm animals, tractors, etc.
B00AWL47GK|5|The clip is nice and sturdy.  The price was good, and it goes well with 2 of my suits.
B00LMGMDWO|5|So cute. My daughter LOVESSS it! :-)
B0012XXBY6|4|Very pleased
B004Q5UR6M|5|Very nice.  Perfect for what was needed.
B008MB3KAG|5|Im actually wearing this today i love the way it fits my body perfectly!! and great material doesnt feel cheap!!
B004I7BL3G|5|Great looking jacket. It is stitched very nicely with beautiful top stitching at the bottom of sleeves and hemline. The Capri blue I purchased is very vibrant, and it was on sale, too.  The fleeces is super soft, comfy, and lightweight, but warm.  With it's longer length (covers the hips) and deep pocket, this jacket can be worn as outerwear in above freezing weather. The side seam pocket don't add any bulk to the hip area. The zipper is sewn in straight and it's a good quality zipper, dyed to match the color of this jacket. The collar is not bulky and attached very smoothly.<br /><br />I think this jacket runs quite large. It is definitely generously cut to serve as outerwear. A sweater and vest or blazer can be layered underneath and there will still be plenty of room. I didn't purchase to use as outerwear, but to coordinate and give a finished look to casual pants.  I purchsed the 1x and should have gotten a medium for  my purposes....and I'm full busted.  These jackets are plenty roomy.  Unless you want a really loose fitting jacket or plan on using bulky layers underneath, I suggest sizing down.  I decided  to keep the jacket and wear it as a \\"coat\\". Even though we are having very cold weather, with layers this jacket provides enough warmth when I'm running errands in the car.  I wore it while shopping and actually preferred it to my heavy down coat.
B00II9D7WI|5|love these leggings, very comfortable, great price
B00N21DH5Y|5|Thank you perfect time
B002X085CU|3|Very thin, but I only wanted it as neck scarf accessory to wear with an outfit, rather than using it as a shawl.
B007L41V2E|1|These leggings wore out, as another reviewer has stated, after only about ten wearings. The fabric got thin and they split along the seams. Would not recommend.
B00E9ZW7YE|4|I bought the blouse for my daughter it fit nice but a bit tight on the arms. but all in all very good for the price
B00JGHNIT8|5|Very good quality and well design. I was very please with the purchase.
B00M7YV4B6|2|Was bigger than expected. And has a weird smell that I've tried twice to wash out. It keeps coming back.
B007OVOAF4|5|I went on a retreat with a group of mature women.  Given everyone's personal summers, I was expecting to be cold.  Sure enough with the temperature set to 68 I would have frozen.  But NOPE, I happily put on my Microfleece Onesie and I was just fine. Great product and it is true to size.  I was expecting that with feet I would be straining to pull up the hood.  But NOPE it worked perfectly and I can actually put it on over my PJ's and wear it instead of a bathrobe.
B001D05SMQ|4|I ordered a 0, and it's really long. I really like the texture and the fit, and I think the back pockets look very attractive. There were a few loose strands of thread, but it's no problem after you cut it. Still, I have to fix the length at some point, otherwise, great jeans.
B003WCWX3U|5|I love the color combination of brown and purple in this outfit. The bear printed on the seat of the pants is very cute \\"bear bottom\\". The outfit washed up nicely and seems very durable.
B004W2G40C|1|This is my first review for a product that I have bought on Amazon.  Why?  Because these pants are the worst thing I have ever bought.  They do NOT look like the photos.  The fabric is thin and after the first wash look like a pair of old work pants, but with cuffs!  Here are some of the problems:<br />1. Pants fade drastically after first wash (Yes, we know how to wash, so it was not because of that!)<br />2. Will not hold a crease, and looks like they have never seen an iron 20 minutes after you put them on.<br />3. Fabric feels thin and cheap.<br />4. Cuffs deform and look &#34;after-market&#34;.<br />I bought a pair of Savane Tailored2U and LOVE them.  They are everything that these Dockers are not.  I hope this will help you as you make your choice and you won't make the same mistake I did.
B00FR8AIO8|4|Shirt's a bit snug, even though the size is what I ordered. Had to stretch it out some. Guess its just how its made. Not really the distributor's fault. Still a badass shirt though. \m/
B00BUBS762|5|AWESOME! MY HUSBAND'S EYES POPPED! ITS NOW MY FAVORITE PAIR OF SHORTS NOW. LADIES YOU NEED TO GET A PAIR TO KEEP YOUR MAN'S EYES ON YOUR BOOTIE AND NOT OTHER FEMALE BOOTIE. TRUST ME CAUSE I NOW GOT LOTS OF DOUBLE TAKES AND NEVER HAD BEFORE BRAZILLIAN BUTT LIFTING SHORTS. THEY'RE NOT LYING. THANKS
B0018MWXSQ|5|I bought them for my husband and he really liked them, he has worn them a few time and gets compliments from both men, women and kids.
B003AU5W3W|5|I wanted something comfortable and light to wear to bed, but also something I could wear if I needed to answer the door or flee a burning building!
B00R7F5I8A|3|Had to return the shirt. Ordered a large for my average size 11 year old and it was the size of a medium. The shirt did look nice, too bad the sizing seems off.
B00MSEPFQK|5|My husband loves it!
B00JABZX70|5|I love underwires for support and this one is very comfortable.  I also love Bali for the endurance of the bra.
B003WY5J98|1|These shorts are extremely brief and are not the longer length as described. Only a 3 inch inseam! They are short-shorts. Even a child would expect longer shorts. They are not heavy weight as described, they have no pockets, and I actually doubt these shorts are a men's garment. Might very well be a womens shorts. Ordered for my husband who wears a Medium. I am going to see if one of my grandchildren might fit them or want as a sleeping short. Save your money!
B00KFVR37C|5|Im 5'3 weight 170lbs and bought  a size Large. This dress  looked great and it was easy to put on and the material was also good... worth  the prize
B005CWO0H0|5|Shouldn't expect this to keep you warm as it is very thin, however it is perfect for everyday use and very soft and comfortable.
B008VAR8GA|5|The belt does not have pre-determined holes in it, so it is truly customizable. This is my third pair.  Although shorts are not necessarily the biggest deal in one's life, it's nice to know that these little niceties are there. The extra pockets are great.
B00CUXG55Y|5|Great
B004SWGMWQ|3|wont be able to put in dryer because of the fit is ok right now
B004LRO48C|5|Worth every penny! A little tricky to get on, but very comfortable! I bought the One Size Plus, I'm 5'9\\" and 260lbs and fits great with room to spare. As stated in other reviews, if you're tall, it won't really stay up on your shoulders, but is it really gonna be on that long anyways? ;) Looks great, no matter what size! Very happy with my purchase.
B006OSNJQO|5|The hat is the real deal, i recommend this hat. however, i don't care for the feather, so i removed it.<br />No hassle transaction.
B003HIBYRK|5|Fit well and make me feel better about myself. I have a tummy bulge and this flattens it.  I like the length as well.
B00AYX8HGM|5|These are my favorite pj's by Carters. The fit is generous on our child without being overly big, the patterns are pretty, and they<br />laundered well.
B00LHK4ATY|5|A sharp looking quality Columbia jacket at a good price. I favor Columbia frequently because the overall quality/value seems to be about the best. The products usually fit as expected too. We definitely need decent products in between Kmart and The North Face!
B00MYAFXC4|3|It was big, but the style is nice!
B007M64R36|3|Just fine for a  'wear once' party
B001LNPC5S|5|Okay, so I like this shirt for the purpose that I bought it for, which is to wear on its own or under t-shirts. It's not really sheer, but it is a very thin and soft fabric, which is fine for me. I've worn it under a vest, a sweater, and to work out in, and it was soft and comfortable in all situations. Also, I am tall and like the shirt too be long, and it is a nice long length. I usually wear a large, and the large I ordered was perfect for me. It is very fitted, which is what I wanted. I liked this shirt so much that I just ordered a few more!
B006NUA6AU|5|This outfit is adorable and fits the American Girl doll.  My granddaughter loved it. Both dresses fit great.  Would absolutely recommend.
B00DXTYH7W|4|I bought this for my maternity photo shoot.  I have never owned a tube bra so I had no idea what to expect.  The bra is comfortable, but there isn't any support or structure.  My photographer will need to photoshop my protruding nipples in the photos where I was cold.<br />All in all, I liked it for my photo shoot and it's good for the $.
B00B182O2M|5|So comfy and really does smooth the back.
B00EDN8YD0|5|good stuff
B00H3TFOJS|5|They're so pink! I love to wear these on gray days. They are super cheeful.
B0037KLTZU|5|Our daughters like this a lot and it fit very nice.
B00006WREH|5|Sorry to be so long in getting back with a response on my experience. I ordered the shirts on I think a wed and they were already in my hands on friday. I don't think I have ever had that fast a service ever. I am very impressed and will use them again. :-) Thank you.
B0068MA88I|5|take this from the pro.people do write reviews about what they perchase,but never write about the size.some times we go from medium to small,or small to medium this is how I perchase this sweater and got the correct fitting
B00DNV1OJY|1|The sizing is way too small and a weird cut. It's too tight around the bust and bunches up.  Also the entire dress is see through.
B00IKBHZMW|5|Excelent quality
B00IXNP2CM|5|My husband adores this hat!
B007CZFSU8|4|I purchased 2 of these shirts.  One for my daughter (6 yrs old) and one for my son (4 yrs old).<br /><br />They enjoy wearing this shirt since they know daddy loves the Yankees.<br /><br />Why did I give it 4 instead of 5 stars?  It's 10 months later and after numerous washes, there is some fade - that's what happens with cotton prints, the colors are no longer vibrant.
B000WKVO80|4|I received these bras and the fit is very nice.  As always, I received them promptly.  I just wish they had the band (connecting the cups) the same as they do with style 4422.  I have washed them several times and they always come out great.  Other than that, very nice bras.
B004XMAIHG|5|love it! thanks
B00UM2S9U4|5|Beautiful !!!
B00BLDSV6U|5|Perfect!
B00AAQTMR6|5|Materials-- the texture makes this a good 5-star shirt. Thick enough to fit nicely without hugging the skin, while still maintaining a fresh feel.<br /><br />Sizing -- I'm a jean size 34, with a slightly bigger upper chest build. This shirt was a spot on fit.
B000XS41UO|5|Im in EMT School so needed these pants.  they are made for EMT's but good for people who like lots of pockets.  they run a size small though, im a 36 and orderd a 36 but should of gotten a 38 other then that one little set back which just means order the next size up.  they are great.  how ever most do not come hemed so will need to do that yourself.
B00AM1BAC4|2|but could be better for a pair of painters jeans. Not cute. I gave them two stars because they are True Religion, therefore qualitly.
B003DCZ56G|3|I got this product 5 days after purchasing it. I tried it on and it made my butt look way too big. I don't know if I can wear because everyone will know it is fake. I might just wear really tight tights and hope it flattens the panties down a lot to make it more realistic. I don't have a big butt but I don't have a tiny butt either, I just wanted a panty that would make it look a bit bigger, but this one is just not the one. I guess if you have a smaller butt this will work a lot better but on me it did not. Also, if you have friends like mine that slap your butt a lot, they will definitely  notice that it's fake by the way it feels and the way it will sound when they slap it, also if your very petite like me the small may fit you a bit loose.<br />  I hope I can make it work in time for the big event that made me buy this product.
B000OTV3I0|2|Bra has no give. Too small. Need to return .
B00HWN3EJ2|5|Wifey loves it!
B00CZ4ROVM|5|I ordered this in a 6 but it was the perfect fit for my little guy. Ordered a 7 and it's perfect with growing room. Very dapper on my little man :)
B0009G64MS|5|Fits perfect
B006SRT7MG|5|This was a great way to keep our 4 year old warm while he was buzzing around with his bumble bee soccer mates!!!
B000EN0VE8|5|I love the flexoline. It's lightweight, stretches really long, and requires no clothespins. The flexoline seems to be made out of the same material as a rubberband but much stronger. The braids are tight enough to hold two pairs of jeans, two shirts, 4 pairs of boxers, and 3 pairs of socks. It will sag unless you tie it over a clothesline. During my trip to China, I stayed in a lot of guest houses and hostels that don't have the amenities like a hotel. These guest houses don't have shower curtains, towel rack, or a clothesline. I ended up tying the flexoline to two chairs and that worked out fine. Many of my friends who saw the flexoline were impressed at how useful was. This product is a must have when traveling overseas.  Hopefully it will last a few more years.
B00K6AYUY6|2|My head is an average size and yh
B00GV3NSZE|4|The jacket was cute and really fit well, that is if I never wanted to button up the jacket. Unfortunately the style of the jacket is not meant for busy girls. The measurements were all true to size and customer service was awesome.
B005H5W2KO|5|Leggings are super cute and work really well with onesies on my 10 week baby boy!they keep his legs warm and he looks adorable in them.they especially are helpful if using cloth diapers. No worries about pants fitting over the diapers. They should last him for many years!
B005GYGEWS|5|They were exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect fit now I'm wondering why I waited this long.  May order another pair I like them so much.
B00OT65CEK|3|I ordered an extra small, and Im still swimming in this dress.<br />Maybe if I wash it on hot, it will shrink up a few sizes.
B00X6HZG2G|5|Exactly like the picture, very good quality for the money.
B005LVPM10|3|fabric was flimsy
B00TKNKRV0|4|Stretches easy but I love the way it hangs and flairs... super cute
B00LTY9994|4|I got size medium. The top fits perfectly fine, but the bottoms are slightly too small. A large bottom would be much more comfortable, but the medium is still wearable.<br />Love the material and the overall look!
B00FMY3T48|2|I ordered large size and it's still small! I'm athletic fit. I feel like this product is for kids to teenages sizes. What a LAME! I'm not happy about it.
B00GUPOHZI|4|Not a lot of lift support but overall very comfortable and easy to use.  Wish it came in nude as well.  Have it in both the black and white.  It will make pumping at work a lot easier.
B007WEGOV6|5|The wallet is perfect . The leather is soft and a good size, a very good product.I love this wallet. I am so glad with my purchase.I will buy in other time in Kenneth Cole.
B003YLVB5A|2|I love Spanx and have several pairs like this one. However, after wearing this only twice, it came apart at the seams around the panty area and leg. I'm wondering if this was a defect or poor stitching. I'm frankly disappointed with this purchase and feel like I've wasted my money.
B000HATYEG|4|The jacket was extremely wrinkled, and I had to re-tack the hat to make it resemble the picture; but all-in-all, cute!
B00LBUVJ0I|5|Good value for the price.
B0015015TE|5|Absolutely love this wallet! Very classy, convenient and durable.
B006IYVKLK|5|I've had this beautiful ushanka for about a month now, and I have to say, I am not disappointed AT ALL. It's very comfortable, and very soft to the touch. I find myself wearing this all day, due to how much I'm in love with this hat!<br /><br />If you want to support the Motherland and you want to get some compliments about wearing it (I've definitely gotten more than a few while out in public xD) then I'd DEFINITELY recommend it to anyone interested.
B00C7WFESC|1|really this is the first time that i face such issue with Levi's size, all my Levi's 38x32 but this time it was too small, i am really unhappy.
B0024KF37Y|5|I wanted a hooded robe that I could wrap around myself when I get out of the hot tub. Most women's robes are too short/small for me. This robe is perfect! The terry cloth is very soft and warm and does a great job of drying me off. Note, I am 5'5&#34; tall and quite wide, and the hem of the robe comes almost to the floor on me. If you are very tall, this might not be long enough for you. The sleeves are way too long for me, so I rolled them up, no problem. This is a good buy.
B00P4XZNJQ|5|It was even prettier in person and beautiful on I would defiantly recommend this dress to anyone going to a prom or for a wedding 😃
B00KBL9PQI|3|Purchased the red and worn it once. It runs pretty small in my opinion. I ordered a M and am a size 4. Plus, it was pretty short for a long maxi skirt.
B00BLW2STC|2|I ordered a few different style tops in xl. This top was way too<br />Small.
B00G487QE0|4|The product is not so bad, looks nice the color and the size is perfect. Good experience for my first purchase I willing to buy more in the future.
B00Q48N3QA|2|Very disappointed, very poor quality material.  This is a gift that I'm not happy to be giving.
B00G3INA9Q|1|I thought that the quality would be better. The ear flaps were useless. They are just for decoration. I bought it for a costume that would be worn once. It would be pointless to wear it to keep warm.
B00HAKJ8TW|5|This jacket fits somewhat large, but that's a good thing. This jacket was ordered for my 7 year old nephew who is growing everyday. He loves this jacket and is very pleased with it. I look for him to wear this jacket for several years before it needs to be replaced. Thank you for everything.
B004I5NU78|5|The pants I bought for my son was the fourth pair I have bought him. He wears them for work and really like's the way they fit.<br />And they are a good quality. Thank You
B000JXN21W|4|I want to exchange these for a size 8.  The size 10 was too large for me.  Hope the 8 will work.
B005G1HPJM|4|I purchased this tie as a gift. It looked beautiful, but can't comment on the quality since I didn't use it myself. Can't go wrong with this price!
B000N23HEG|4|Soft fabric, the gown moves when I move. The color matches the picture. I would buy this gown again. It seems a little  expensive however.
B00NL3FLJI|1|parts were missing, poor quality!
B00J1LW5ZC|4|I had to fix this to fit, looks great after.
B000783Q7Y|5|I bought a 5xt with the intention of shrinking down to a 4x after a bad experience with another brand. The initial fit was a tad too large but after washing and drying in medium heat it didn't shrink as much as I expected. Very comfortable fit and the zipper is well made. No loose threads or shoddy stitching. There are even little end caps on the draw string for the hood so they don't fray. Well worth the money.
B00CLFLY2A|5|FAST SHIPPING, ITEM EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED, GREAT PRICE, EXCELLENT  TRANSACTION, THANKS
B00FI6CJWS|5|Great normal size pins (: !!!
B00HS30VGA|5|I should have known that these probably will not fit my newborn in March, but the colors are really pretty and they will look darling once she can fit them. :)
B00NJ384YO|5|Love these scrubs! They are so comfortable and not baggy like other scrubs. The color looks great! I would definitely recommend these! I am 5'2&#34; and got an XS.
B00W6VALVY|4|Very nice and easy to wear.  I'd order from them again.<br /><br />Contessa
B00ASLPP42|3|I was surprised at how thin the material was. They look fine though. I'm not sure how long they will last.
B00F9FOQOW|2|Not an 80 inch scarf, its a 60 inch scarf. Pretty poor that they continue to advertise it incorrectly. Low to average quality, but nice colors.<br /><br />Not worth it to return it.
B0010VF6VG|4|My husband was in Medium everything for quite some time and still is.  Mediums in every other brand of underwear as well.<br />This one would qualify as a \\"Small\\" in his wardrobe and it does not fit.<br />So, get for you Medium-size wearing man (32x32, etc.,) a Large size.<br />Otherwise - the quality is good, the look is decent.
B00JM9PN9S|4|The top looks like it's a mustard yellow but it's actually really bright banana yellow, which I was totally  happier with.
B00UBUBW38|5|The cups are a bit big for me, but it's still super cute. Love the fit otherwise.
B00DOI67RK|4|I wore these on valentines day with a black dress and they were super cute! I would definitely purchase this brand in more colors.
B001K3A1FU|5|Was ideal, loved how it looked on me!
B0073GUB8K|5|this dress is beautiful, my daughter was super-perfect, the fabric is comfortable, I like the details and embroidery. thank you
B00LB7VDW0|5|Love it!!
B0053W90E2|2|I'll be returning this, but wanted to review it for those checking it out.  I wanted to like it, but it is short and wide- just not a flattering fit.
B00HEHQD2Q|4|Love these!!! So cute :)
B0036WOLQI|5|I got this buckle for my husband. It is perfect size  for man or woman, nice quality and durable. Very good price, looks more expensive. Highly recommend!
B002ZZIH6W|5|Get many compliments on this shirt.  It is also made of quality cotton, thicker and with some body to it.
B007GC01HW|5|Great material!
B00J9EPZAI|5|Got these for my mom for Christmas.  She loves them.  They are soft, warm and really pretty.  I was happy because My mom was so happy.  They look great too.
B00858ILPU|3|I love the fit and the length.  Looking forward to future purchases of the same fabric but with different colors.
B00J1L2DEA|4|This is very pretty, fits nice, looks dressy.
B00NWHYWMU|5|Wonderfully warm and lightweight, not bulky under clothing.  Exactly as advertised, fast shipping, a pleasure doing business.
B00C5GIMTS|3|I'm 5.8 and 150lbs and this costume was so short that i had to wear it with leggins and still my entire buttom was showing.<br />But it was cozy and warm!
B0044VJRNC|5|I really liked the detail of the lace
B0006M6VL4|5|I have a Wickie Wear headband and decided to try the bandana. It fits very nicely. It doesn't show it in the photo, but the back where it ties, also has a stretchy headband connector underneath, which helps it fit well and also creates a ponytail hole. I haven't worn it yet, but plan to wear it under my helmet when cycling.
B000DZA4KI|5|Worth every penny. I really like the style of this hat. I have been looking for one like this and finally found it.
B0112VLCV6|3|These were a bit snug for me in the thigh and crotch area. Also, the fabric is a little scratchy. Looked nice and professional though so a decent deal for the price.
B00OP8LFMA|5|Wife loves them.  Straps are holding up, unlike other comments.  For the price, i'll prob buy more.
B001MXKF22|5|VERY NICE, WASNT SURE IT WAS GOIN TO FIT..BUT IT DID, ITS COMFORTABLE AND I LOVE THE LACE PATTERN. ITS GREAT TO WEAR UNDER AN OUTFIT AS WELL! TY
B00GV4BUV2|3|I'm 5'9'' about 160 lbs and this shirt fit just like the picture.  The same length also.  Overall good purchase.
B0000ZDAXE|5|This is a great bra for a firm hold and a natural look for those who have conicle breasts. It does not add bulk but is good for shaping and for thicker knits.
B005FD4XTG|5|My Hubby looked great!<br />The quality was great, just like it looks in the picture. The vest texture looks fancy.
B0080RWFDK|5|So cute! My son was adorable for Halloween. The shoe straps on the bottom broke within an hour of trick or treating but other than that the costume held up well even after washing and drying.
B001FL7TLG|5|Nice wings but they are kinda tight straps; hurts to wear for long.
B004S6KXZO|2|This hat is really bad quality. I suppose it's good if you have a big head because it went down to my eyes. The center button is off to one side.
B001PTGAYU|5|Good quality. New packaging
B004SDYQJ6|5|i do enjoy new underwear and this is just that
B00PJJ7OVK|4|I love this shirt - it is flowy, true to size. Just a nice summer shirt for work or doing whatever.
B0036ZA1QY|1|I fell prey to looking at the original price and seeing the percentage off on this one.  It is my fault and no one elses.  A comparable shirt can be purchased for $10 (full price) at any store in your area.
B0077CO5XC|5|Great price and nice quality.  My team members love the women's fit.
B007Q7OV5A|1|Too many things to say that are terrible o about this.<br />Let's start slow.<br />1. Material is consist of a child's Halloween costume.<br />2. Sleeves are shown as 3/4 sleeves. They go all the way to your wrists.<br />3. The slits on the dress should be on the side and not very big. They are on the front and are so large the bottom one went from my side all the way to the opposite thigh. Straight over over the crotch.<br />4. I am 5'1&#34;, clearly not at all a tall person,  therefore you would think I should have no problem with length. It is so short that it appeared to be one of the, longer cut shirts. It went nearly as high as your underwear would go.
B00A2UKDPU|5|Have been a fan of Overland Sheepskin Co. since they opened their first store in Taos, NM, where lived in the early 1970s. This family-run business has expanded greatly since then, but has maintained their high quality standards. These gloves live up to those standards. They are warm, comfortable, good-looking and stylish, for a very reasonable price. Great gift idea!
B00CLF4OCM|3|32C bra and the chest part fits really tight. It hits right above my knee-- i'm 4'11 in height. The side cut outs part looks TERRIBLE. it is scrunched up and not sexy at all. It makes me look like I tried to be sexy and failed. Which is pretty much what happened. lol. Tight in wrong spots basically. The only reason I'm not returning this is because I don't want to pay for shipping and don't think they will refund my shipping charges like it says they would.
B00S2PZYHO|4|This top is very flattering on, although it does run big so I needed an XS. The coral can look almost neon in certain lighting, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B00IOYGI5K|5|Good quality.
B0060LR4JS|3|It's a great jacket but they have to work on the zipper its terrible. Almost a deal closer for me. My son now uses it but it doent get a lot of wear.
B003CMYTAA|5|These socks are super thick, warm and comfy-- fit great under boots or without shoes around the house. I'd buy them again!
B008KECJ0W|4|Very nice shawl,I purchased this for my wedding.It was a second wedding so I wore silver and white and everything looked great the shawl can be worn for formal or informal.
B00B9X4XQO|3|I ordered this shirt on the 5th of October and received it the 15th or 16th of October which is good I guess since it said I wouldn't get it until the 31st.  The wrist part seem larger than I expected I thought they would be tighter on the wrists so it gave the arms a more flowy look. I think if it would've been like that I would've liked it better because when the wrist part feels wide like the sleeve it kind of  fells like the shirt is just too big maybe ill try ordering a smaller size.  And it doesn't quite hang off the shoulder like the picture unless you move it to that position if you just put it on it just kind of hangs a little bit off each shoulder not too much though.  Ill probably order another one in another size just to see how it looks in a smaller size.
B008X0ELSG|5|I got this for my son to wear for Christmas with a black and white striped sweater. SOOOO CUTE!<br />I will have to say that I was expecting a hot pink and this was more of a bright salmon. I guess better for a 6 year who doesn't wear &#34;pink&#34;.
B007I4HHES|4|Cool shirt. Was supposed to be kale colored, seemed more black than kale but I'll take it.
B00IKFOY86|5|I really love it, it look exactly like in picture. But it turn out more like crop top in the picture it look long enough on model but the martial it good and good for winter and fall.
B006TCJOS2|5|I love the fit of this hat. Very comfortable, Carhartt is a great product, color is a true gray and works well with my gray Carhartt work twill uniform pants.
B00N1QCQKW|5|Nice!!!!
B00565W2M8|4|I have bought four pairs of these Levi's 535 \\"jeggings\\" before, although only the color I got is \\"Night Out\\" (dark indigo denim) prior to ordering this pair in \\"Denim Desert\\".<br />I can tell you with true certainty that this color runs TWO sizes smaller, I don't know why.<br />I always wear Juniors Size 7 - in this exact jean, mind you - but in this color I could hardly get them up, was far from closing the zipper.<br />I reordered Size 11 (skipped 9 because these were sooo small) and (thankfully) they fit well.<br />The color is beautiful, I love it, the quality is good, but please consider the sizing issue.
B00OTTKBKW|4|very comfortably, color great,and well fitting
B006UD8UG2|5|I really like this dress.  The fabric is quite wrinkle resistant, too.  The belt is so-so, but it's more of an after thought anyway.  Find your own belt!
B00IAB8E7W|4|Pretty much as expected
B0018OOT7M|3|My husband has used Levi's since 1998. From time to time he bought other brands, but he always returned to Levi's. He asked me to buy a pair of Levi's 501 as a present for his brother (size is W33L32, in \\"Rinse\\" color). The pair of Levi's 501 from Amazon was made in Egypt. This pair is really worse than all pairs of Levi's 501 we have bought before (their were made mostly in Turkey).<br /><br />I don't want to say \\"It's a bad jeans\\", but I'm not sure the regular price is OK for it (I bought cheaper). Fabric is good. Size is correct. Color is good. This pair of jeans wasn't made accurately. It looks made hastily. If I could see it offline I'm not sure I would like to buy it.
B00ISRCM76|5|Very nice fit. Breathes well
B00IUHHYTK|5|really nice,fit really good on me.
B00COPU6KS|4|It's was a great product but it was a lil to tight I understand it has to be tight but this one was to much lol .. But u decided to get a large and make my way down till I fit in it ..
B004DCAEXO|4|The jeans feel and look great. However the material is kind of thin but it's okay for the price.
B00WNRUPJO|3|Bottoms were too small while the top was too big... Wish you could pick different sizes for both
B000XZ6XZS|5|Love  that the hood is loose around the head, excellent fit.  Works great with rest of costume
B00PNINV8W|5|Love it. Very comfortable. Best bra ever.
B00AZ6SAHY|5|Sizing is accurate, and i was able to buy a larger size than neccessary so I don't have to worry about throwing them in the dryer. Material is not too thick or thin. Carolina blue is less bright than on a computer screen, which is what I wanted. Also got black heather. I'd stay away from the light gray; they will stain easily and be almost tranparent.
B00JDWG4OC|5|Wife's a size 2, fit her perfect. Liked them so much I ordered her another pair.
B00IYUOCM0|5|It's the missing piece for my wedding dress!
B009FXKYAY|5|I got these for my sis who loves pandas n i checked them out before i wrapped them we wear same size shoe. They are so cutecn comfy and she's going to love them.
B002USCHMO|5|It is strong even if it washes how many times.<br />Moreover, it is one of the goods to buy if there is an opportunity.
B0051HFHXW|1|The seems cut into your hips too much...
B007IEG6ZE|4|It's a cheap material, but does it job. Has a good puff, fit as expected and it worked great on my costume. I only used it once, so I can't tell if it's resistant, but it looks like it is.<br />I think it's just a little pricey for what it is, but after searching online, it was the best buy and it still is.
B00NB9PC9G|5|Excellent cap
B0029F1X2S|3|i received the red shirt today. the shirt material was thick and had a zipper all the way down the back. but, i found some problems. it came with 4 metal pips but there was 3 gold and 1 black. and to my knowledge that is not a rank in star trek. the picture showed 4 gold pips so that was disappointing.also the communicator badge that came with the shirt was scratched with some of the paint off.
B00NJ2HVEY|4|adorable hat but too small for a one year old.
B00IAZWZLY|3|sheer
B00SP02140|5|love love them they are so soft and stretchy they are so comfy!
B00UZV7F02|5|Cute top!! Looks like the picture
B000PYM96Y|5|A very well made shirt that gets lots of comments, Fine fit for a xx-large with little or no shrinkage
B007PPGCSW|2|LEE a very good, the fabric is comfortable, the price is very cheap, trousers legs mast, waist circumference, too lazy to change
B00O1CADTG|5|got these for my husband who's worn waffle knit thermals his whole life and loves them. I wear fleeced lined everything and I'm never cold so I took a chance. If I told him I was getting them he would have said no but surprise. I made him wear them to work one day as it's cold and he's outside 90% of the time.  He's loves them and I bought 2 more sets. I usually buy medium for him in everything and though it fits he prefers the large because the length of the arms and legs fit better.
B00VOJ83XC|5|I typically don't wear colored pants, but for the price, I figured I would give these a try. I like the skinny fit because it has a more modern/stylish look to it and looks great as a summer outfit with sandals or heels.<br />I've found that I can pretty much pair it with any color of tank top or tee and it looks nice. My favorite colors to pair with it are blue and black. I have a handkerchief style tunic that I just got that is blue with fringe and it accents really nicely with the yellow jeans.<br />I love the way these Silver Suki's fit. They're very comfortable to wear throughout the entire day and I don't have to worry about them shrinking in the dryer either.<br />I have really enjoyed wearing these yellow jeans to get me out of my comfort zone and into something new besides denim!
B00CJE5M3A|4|I really like this compression garment, it's nice and tight, however, it runs short in the bodice, which means it doesn't hold in the excess under arm chubbiness I, unfortunately have to deal with. This garment also has a large open crotch area, which is a must. In the past I purchased Marena or  Veronique in medium which has always fit perfectly.  I'll have to order a large the next time.
B00KDQE386|3|large fit
B001D1H6UW|4|This wig is delicate, but it looks great with a Wonder Woman costume.  Be careful with the lining - it's easy to rip, but it only costs $10-12 and you're only wearing it a night.  The lining is longer than usual, which makes it easier to wear if you have long hair you're trying to hide.  The top-knot is really poofy - very Winehouse.  I'd recommend stuffing the inside of the wig with tissue to keep the shape if you're storing it.  It has a tendency to flatten if you don't.
B000A2KA4O|5|Great item. Love them and they are good and heavy duty. Shipping speed was excellent and well worth the money. Will definitely be buying more.
B00939OI6G|5|Love it! Fast shipping! Everything I expected!
B00H1S7LDS|4|Oh I love this bra it's worth the buy.
B00P0DPWSW|5|It seemed small at first, but you have to get used to it.
B003BG4QZA|4|Reasonably priced, good quality, and fit great inside western boots. Would also work as a second layer of socks for hiking or working.
B00KSCQX4M|4|I was pleased with the purchase enough to order the same again
B00AKUUY6A|1|If your 5'4&#34; they will cover part of your rear-end. I hated them but gave them to a needy person..
B00VK0OGWW|5|I love it!
B00H5LN7H0|5|Purchased this for a friend of mine who is a huge 10th Doctor fan.  It fit her very well, and the shipping was pretty quick.  I would definitely recommend this item for any ladies that would like to get in on the 10th Doctor Cosplay!
B008SDW06I|4|The main thing wrong is the print location for XL.  It's too far forward so it's off.  Other then that, it's great.
B00CLD1AOY|5|Nice hat for golf! Keeps the sun out.
B002BSLCTW|5|I bought this item for a masquerade party, thinking it would be low-quality and would only last a few days. To my amazement, this is a beautiful hand-woven scarf that is quality-made. it was not only a highlight of my party with many people asking me where I bought it, but it has now become an item I wear regularly. I have hand-washed it and air-dried it twice and the colors are as vibrant as the day it came out of the package. For the price, it is an unbelieveable value. I have traveled all over the world and have purchased many indigeous textiles and know what I am talking about.
B004A7XY5W|5|I usually buy these at Walmart, but I can never find my size and white bikini underwear.  I love the fact that it is sold in bulk and all I want was white.  All I can ever find is briefs and those are way too high.  I'm young, not old, so I still like bikinis.  The quality is ok, but I also don't need thick cotton.  These are great for everyday use.
B006K3A0K6|5|This is the perfect gown for my son. I don't have to struggle pulling it over his head. So cute! Thank you
B004B8C2CQ|4|This is a nicely woven, cotton shemagh. It is for casual use and would not hold up well for use as everyday work wear. It is a scarf, not a tool.
B00JUETL7U|5|BUEN PRODUCTO
B00DWN87HU|2|not only are they over-sized, the leg holes are enormous. Worst still, there's no stretch to th eleastic leg holes and waist. Thisis not what to expect, given the price.
B00QYG0KGI|1|The fabric is cheap and this shirt would not fit an adult woman. When I received it, it looks like it would fit my seven year old niece. I asked to return it but because it ships out of China they said it would not be cost effective for me to send it back so I might as well just keep it. Now I have this piece of crap sitting on my floor. I can't do anything with it and its way to mature to give to her,
B000W5OUU4|5|Went to a halloween party and got multiple compliments about this costume.  Might consider wearing it as a dress to got out...
B002DPMMLA|5|My daughter is a Spock fan. Nice tshirt with good graphics.  Live long and prosper.
B00HU0OAI6|5|So cute. My son wore these on the day we came home from the hospital  (easter Sunday) they were adorable on his tiny feet!
B00KRJI4OS|3|The clors are more cream and black that white but I liked the fit and it will be perfect as a beach cover.
B00AY0JITA|4|Bought this as a gift for my husband. It shipped to me really fast and it matched the image. Very pleased with my purchase.
B00M56XZZO|5|As all the reviews say, this runs very small. I ordered 24 month for my 12 month boy and it fits just right. Easier on and off with the 2 zippers and the price is just right.
B00QM2S6O2|4|Very nice. I love them!! But the size runs small
B00BG9HKJ8|2|Despite ordering my normal size, it did not fit at all and I will have to return it. Will not re-order.
B004QXYPOO|3|They are somewhat larger than the size indicated, but my granddaughter will grow into them. I recommend going with a smaller size.
B004ROUWAI|1|Jewels are cheap plastic, sewn unevenly ad falling off, scratched, chipped, etc.  Material is thin and cheap looking and entry of arm holes narrow substantially compared to size of shirt.  Like a triangle top to bottom.  Colors are much more muted.  The greens are more creamy colored and the pinks are much more coral than red or pink.  I returned both colors. WW is notorious for sending damaged items and then charging you restocking fees and you have to waste your time getting it taken care of properly!
B0083WASZO|4|Bought 10 of these for the lineman on my sons football team. He uses it every day and it has held up well.
B0007YXUSI|5|I have tried many underwire bras over the years and this one is as comfortable as I have ever found. On many styles the underwire is too long in front and makes it look as if I have a third breast but this bra's underwire doesn't do that; it lies flat on my chest. It also gives good support and lift for an older, full breasted woman without giving her an odd shape or over spillage. I would recommend this garment to any woman who wants comfort and support.
B00GI1IBII|5|Awesome leggings!! These are the best post-pregnancy leggings!! So comfortable and make me feel way more confident!!!
B004M6XUI2|5|This is an excellent wallet. Great as a gift or for yourself. I was impressed with the material quality and the price paid for it. Its a must have if you change wallets often like me.
B00GGIOA5Q|1|Pants came with the legs litterly cut off!! Raveling everywhere!!<br />So upset!
B001CVG3W0|5|This item was as advertised. it was awesome and fufilling in every way. Will definitely shop with this seller again.
B00OSD53FC|5|Nice quality and nice colors.
B00WPKMHZ4|1|Wore once right after I received it. Disappointed the dye wasn't set. Keep in mind I never washed it before I wore it and it has only been rinsed after this photo. This suit is not meant for pools or hot tubs. I went in with 6 people and my suit was the only one altered...my other suits from target seem to be just fine. Hopefully Amazon will replace...bc this suit is so adorable!
B00FYEXD4W|5|Love it
B003QOURA0|3|The shirt was ordered as per instructions from our church of which you service all the time, however; the church logo was not on my shirt nor was an iron on logo included in the package.<br /><br />Would you please instruct me on how best to get this done or send me an iron on; the shirts are normally embroidered. I need this ASAP. The Church name is: \\"The Church Without Walls\\" ministry name is: \\"Mosaic Women Ministry\\"<br /><br />Thanks So Much,<br />Jerdine Williams
B00IU1UHYU|2|Thin fabric, needs ironing after washing. I'm tall with curvy hips and the waist on this skirt is way too loose, I will definitely have to sew an elastic in the top part to prevent it from sliding down, even though it fits tightly over the hips!! The length is perfect for me.
B005GINS3M|4|well he shirt is a liitle bit small for my original size (L), but it is a nice shirt, really confortable and great design.
B00BBNP10Y|4|The seller contacted me shortly after purchase to confirm my measurements and to ensure I ordered the right size (A+ for that). Lead time for delivery was several weeks after purchase since it was coming from China, but it came within 2 weeks (A++ for that).<br />Overall the material is light weight, stretchy and form fitting; the interior of the fabric is comfortable against skin (not itchy or stiff) and feels breathable when compared to a wet-look vinyl/pleather one-piece; the stitching is pretty standard and neat; the sheen and stretch to the fabric is as depicted on the model (it's got a great shine). There is a double zipper feature - one zipper at top, the other at the bottom/crotch - so if this suit is meant for dance team or costume purposes, the second zipper at the bottom will have to be anchored or secured with a couple of quick stitches to avoid any embarrassing clothing malfunctions.<br />So far, so good. Not sure of the longevity of the suit so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 for that reason only (and would recommend hand washing and line drying).
B00KTY08VI|1|These 2 Puma Sport Fleece sets that I just purchased smell like some nasty chemical. I have washed them 3 times and have had them in the sun all day and they still smell. This is the last time I'm buying Puma. I see they were MADE IN CHINA......FIGURES.<br /><br />I'm quite disappointed.<br />Grandma
B0046MAHRY|5|My husband loves this item - this is his second pair.  I love them too - he looks great in his beautiful<br />pj's.  ;)
B003CNRNES|5|I purchased this skirt as a work skirt for one of my daughters but it was too snug.  I suspected it might be too snug but then it does have a great deal of stretch, so I took a chance.  Both my daughters did not like the high waist style, however, my niece did like this look, so I believe it is an individual preference.  It's too bad it didn't fit anyone (too large for my youngest daughter, too small for the middle one) since I thought it looked very sharp and well made.  Recommend.
B003WR2X2G|4|Upon receiving these boots I was very excited about how awesome they looked, but was slightly disappointed that they were not the quality that I had expected. Had they been less expensive, thought, it wouldn't be a problem. Very cute and accurate sizing, just wish they were were made with better materials.
B0053H6IEC|5|I love this hat, goes well with about anything. I would say that if your head is bigger you're going to be on the last rungs though as it's smaller than most of my other snapbacks by the same brand.
B00KSKGDJO|2|didnt know what i was buying...
B00C9UP996|5|I wear one of these bras to work everyday.  They are comfortable and durable.  I have recommended them to people in my office and they too love them.  Try them, you won't be disappointed.
B005SS9KE6|5|i love the shirt but cant really see what it says. would someone be able to tell me so i can decide if i want to order it? :)
B00164KZ9A|5|This bra is not only very pretty the fit is fabulous. The straps can be rearranged in two more configurations,the bra is pure comfort. Sent to me packaged very pretty. I am not a full figured women so sometimes there is more bra than me,not with this bra. The straps are also very adjustable to size.
B008PBHLOE|5|Great hoodie 1 of my favorites fits good looks good exactly what you think it is definitely would recommend it
B00KMAM0E2|5|Good quality, nice fit
B0026K7L3Q|5|I LOVE THESE. I currently own the pink and the blue and plan to get the sliver. I wish they made more colors because I'd buy all of them! They look amazing, and nothing short of that. They are comfortable, and show off your butt perfectly!
B00GUPI0DI|5|Great
B00F4WT9CE|5|I really love it, the way it fits and the way it looks
B00JB5137E|5|I got a size bigger for the perfect fit. I love this jacket for church.
B00B82TGZY|3|The outfit is cute and does fit well.  The material is not the best and the shade of the pants is lighter than the shirt.
B00BVTUHHU|5|This swimsuit cover is cute, gives great coverage and fits great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing one
B008LY41Q6|5|Bought as a gift for my wife. She loves it and the color really is nice. I personally wish it was a little larger, but 'frog lovers' will enjoy it.
B000EDKGKW|1|This company refuesed to ship my item due to a pricing error on their part. I do not recommend companies who do not honor their advertised products and prices.
B00NHTYA2U|4|Even though this suit did not work for my boyfriend (barrel chest with broad shoulders does NOT work for slim fit, FYI), the quality was lovely. The finish was excellent and we were very disappointed that it didn't work for him. The fabric was high quality and the suit construction seemed to be fantastic. We have been shopping for suits for quite some time and this was by far the best quality we have come across in the $500 price range. If you (or someone you shop for) more of an average build or long and lanky, this suit is for you and it's fantastic! Buy it. :)
B00EZDE63A|5|Nice product and fast shipment.
B00D7YJ0M0|3|The waiste is too large.
B00HWHDS62|1|My daughter and I bought it, because it looked good on the images shown.<br />We regret buying this shirt, poor quality for the price. Won't recomend.
B0001YS124|5|exellent comfortable jeans.  Better still, the 28&#34; inseam means I wear them like they come.  Even a 80 year old man can put on six suspender buttons in a couple hours
B00DKSZLS0|5|We only buy Docker's (higher end) pants for my husband to wear to work.  They are consistent, wash well and hold their shape well.  Great product.
B00RX6ZNAG|3|6-9 month size fit my 3 month old. Quality of product was fine.
B008FSENRA|4|Love it
B008LOM16I|2|Way to small not sure who's 2xl they used but it was not u.s.
B00G0IVEM4|5|Fits great!  Doesn't shrink in the wash, great red color--one of my favorite shirts!  It fits more like an XL than other Doctor Who shirts that tend to shrink in the wash.
B00VDRPF2M|2|The top was too big and the bottom I could not even get over my knees. There was no give in the elastic at all for the bottoms. Definitely going to be a little more cautious when ordering clothing on Amazon. Be sure to read the reviews on products and if there is no review there is a reason for it .
B00CYRZTG2|5|Good quality. Wasn't expecting it to have a velcro back (was hoping for iron-on), but that was my mistake for not reading the description clearly. I'll find an alternative way to attach it.
B00QW71EFU|5|Product does as it is intended to do.
B00LIY02QO|5|So cute, well made and for the doll and child perfectly.
B005Q6O9DC|5|My son was dressing up like Steven Spielberg for a class project and this completed his Dreamworks director look.  I was really glad to find it.
B007JAA9LO|5|really cute, quality made costume that is easy to put on. this fits my daughter perfectly at 13 months and 21 pounds.
B00KCNQRZM|5|i have this and gat it fast good for my wife very sexy
B00VTBWCGO|1|Does not fit like the picture shows. Looks like pajamas in person.
B0006LTEPK|5|I spent 2-3 months looking for a good fit on pants, trying everything up to $130 pants from different brands. These ones did the trick for much less. I've bought 3 pairs already. The colors are great too!
B00J9UNG12|3|The jacket looked and felt amazing when I was wearing it. But the main problem is it was to large. I ordered it in 2XL measuring at 48-52 in chest and 41-44 in waist. Which was around my fitting range, but was larger than what I expected. I would not be comfortable wearing it on a normal occasion because it made me look double my size. The jacket overall was appealing and had good quality.
B00KLJIOBC|5|This is tank is beyond soft! Fits great & reminds me of shirts I had growing up but is a very modern & super comfortable style. The sides were a little open for me so I wear a black tank under & it is perfect for everywhere. How can you go wrong with Mickey? Just makes me smile.
B00JLDXP04|4|I am petite and this fits..but a tad too big. But super cute. Needed a small petticoat to go underneath to make it kinda pop and not be super flat. Overall...darling costume!
B006G8JBO6|5|nice short for baby boys and also quick dry.we used on three different (total three weeks ) holiday still looks new
B00K7C313E|5|Very comfy
B00FBD2G2Q|5|thanks
B00BGY41AO|5|My daughter and her best friend looked beautiful in their dresses! Very pleased
B008AY4D0G|1|Orange outter rubber part does not fit correctly.  Orange part is to big/stretched out.  Not worth the money.  Thumbs down.
B000BK4EII|2|I purchased this product to use with tank tops and when the weather is warm to feel free from a regular bra and straps for a while...........but this didnt seem to do much.  I am a C cup and this did nothing to give me life or cleavage and I did EVERYTHING as per the directions on the package.<br /><br />I was really disappointed
B0053XF87O|5|This product is both comfortable and pretty.  It holds me in, gives my waist that extra hour glass look that I like and the boyshort covers that like extra hip area.
B00PRJ1QUM|3|Shirt was ok but it was way smaller than it was meant to be.
B009X5DFNM|5|This hoodie was a gift & my grandson is very pleased. The decoration is nicely do e and the weight if the hoodie is just right, medium weight for warmth without bulk.
B001CVE6YM|5|I absolutley love it.
B00RH3G5J8|3|Too small as I expected for 9m baby
B000LUU662|5|All good things to say about this bra!
B00CE3BA3W|2|The shirt may be okay, but it arrived with the strap already separated from the shirt when I took it out of the package.  I knew I was ordering something low quality, as I just wanted it as an undershirt for nursing, but I would hope it would last longer than shipping.
B00NK0J4YA|5|Awesome product fits as expected and sexy love it and love the way it flutters on my body hot. Will buy more. Great size true to size.
B00AJLL31U|5|These my fav
B00LUUFC7A|4|Cute
B00FPHYDL0|3|Like the style, but ran small. I have always ordered an extra large in  PattyBoutik clothing, , and has always fit, but this was too small to be comfortable. I would say &#34;size up&#34; if you can .
B00KLXWK6S|5|LOVE LOVE LOVE IT
B00CIZZ6HM|3|Overall, not a bad dress for the money.  Because of the irregular stitching and slightly large size, I have to take it to the seamstress to have it corrected.
B00CWZAD8K|1|Had to send back. Took forever. Had to pay the shipping which was $25. Very scratchy material. Flimsy. Will not buy again. It hangs in the back of my closet
B00CTWAOYY|5|Fine quality and fits well.
B00ATEVKME|5|This scarf is WAY softer than I imagined it would be. Especially for the price. I LOVE it. Too bad it is a Christmas gift for someone else! I will have to add it to my wishlist now as well.<br /><br />Notes: It is a true infinity scarf. It does have a seam. One loop went past my waist (I am 5'2) and two loops fit just like the picture indicates.
B00FSB5VSM|5|These are nice. I'm disabled and can't handle buttons or a belt. This solves both problems. Also, they are light enough for hotter weather. Sweat pants are good for cold, but not when it's hot.
B009AMA450|4|love this coat, only get 4 stars b/c the sleeves are short. As long as I keep my arms down, im fine, but lift them up and they creep 2&#34; past my wrist.  People kept saying this coat runs big--it does not.  It fits perfectly everywhere but my arms-although I am tall 5' 9&#34;. Also, the color says navy or blue & its actually more teal very jewel toned- i happen to like that its more teal than navy
B00K1R8IHY|5|I received this kimono &#34;cardigan&#34;.  It was just what I was looking for.  Light, colors vivid, worth the money!  I wore it today and LOTS of compliments!  I would buy more if they offered in other colors!! :)
B009NIJ5BA|5|Nice
B003U5EYJ0|4|Love, love, love this wallet.  Fits perfectly into my clutch and has room for all my money and credit cards.
B00EPJ98KA|5|Comfortable and good quality for Oktoberfest!
B00MM1DP1G|5|I love this little outfit! The detail around the neck is adorable and the shirt is very soft. I would recommend it! I can't wait for my daughter to wear it.
B00HWROH1M|4|Fun underwear, more suited for sex play.
B005GVD7XA|5|I bought one for daughter and one for daughter'n love and they both love it. They say it is soft and warm.
B00DBWM7ZU|4|This dress is comfortable in general and for providing some amount of modesty while nursing. I appreciate that the bust is very forgiving and accommodates my current size H cups. The dress also drapes loosely so no clinging to my still-recovering-from-second-baby bod.
B00C2DJ8YC|5|Let me start by saying that if you have a clothing tape measure-this will make all the difference in making sure you order the correct size. You can find these at your local drugstore or fabric store. I didn't think I needed an XX-Large but I'm glad that I did because it wound up being the correct size for me.The first time I put this on was pure hilarity! After about 15 minutes I finally got it on and it sucked everything in and I was stunned! Even under a relatively thin, light colored dress it is undetectable! It's not so tight where I can't take a full breath but it's tight enough where everything is sucked in and nothing is moving. I wear this every day, all day and take off at night for a brief reprieve occasionally. I also use this with Slim Extreme 3D Thermo Active Serum. I will recommend if you do the same to apply the serum to the cincher instead on applying on the skin. I noticed that application directly on the skin the &#34;burn&#34; doesn't last as long. When applied to the cincher, you should feel the 'burn' for at least 4+ hours.<br /><br />After a week I managed to start using the second row (barely) and the squeeze is definitely more noticeable. So I'm preparing get the next size down. My tummy has always been the one thing I've had the most difficulty getting into shape. This cincher is the TRUTH only if you are prepared to be real with yourself and get the right size.
B00GB831ZG|5|I have an athletic build and Levi's 569 are perfect. Not saggy. Just right. Some very fashionable styles. Levi's are good for any occasion.
B001C4RSWG|3|Wasn't great, feathers starting coming off as soon as I opened the package, but then everyone at the party was losing feathers too  so maybe that's just how they are.  It worked fine for the night.
B000NMKDUW|1|it looks like there is a back on it but there isnt. it was advertised as a air soft vest but it definitely isn't since it has no protection. i think the seller should have more details about the item. they updated this item after i wrote them. They changed it so have more info.
B00JQRQJPI|2|T-Shirts are very large.
B00862D3ZI|4|The quality of the pant is great, but it doesn't fit true to size. It ends up being about an inch extra in the inseam. I just cuffed mine in the end.
B00584O374|5|I bought this outfit for my daughter and when it arrived was vastly impressed with the quality and overall cuteness of this outfit.  It is gathered/roughly pleated or ruched at the neckline, and the bow details are very securely attached (great when you have a child that is young enough to enjoy yanking on things-- my daughter is a toddler).  The picture on the website somewhat 'hides' the colour of the shirt in that it appears to look red-- in person it truly is a dark fuscia colour. The waistline is so very cute on a small child, and the material is warm, soft flannel-- great for cooler weather.  I can see my daughter getting a great deal of wear out of this outfit-- and she looks adorable in it!
B00Y41YM8C|5|I am a petite, size M to L, and the dress looks very nice on me.  It is large, but that is the way it is supposed to be.  I love it and plan to get more in other colors!
B00BMDAG1C|4|It fit as expected.
B00NHK07RG|3|The dress itself fits, but the sleeve were extremely too tight. I appears to be made for someone with very small arms.
B00MPVP91W|5|I wear a 16/18W depending on brand and the 2x was a little big, could have sized down.... Otherwise just as advertised/expected :)
B00I94YJOM|5|Second time purchasing this bra and arrived as expected.  Fit perfectly and is one of the most comfortable bras I've ever owned.
B008PAJBU2|4|Exactly what I'd expect from Tea brand clothing. Fine craftsmanship (most of the time, couple of issues with the brand in the past for basic tees and such.) Love finding this at a good price on Amazon. My daughter looks great in it.
B00B9BPU6I|4|I love the dress..should of brought it one size bigger...my daughter is small frame..so the dress just fit..she will only get to wear it one time..I wanted to get a few wears out of it...but its all good..I pass it down to my cuz baby
B00X90E53Q|5|Nice dress, fit perfectly, not to long, all lace back is nice and split is just rite. Thin material not to heavy and hot. Nice form fitted. Perfect for the summer.
B00OUCQO72|5|Wonderful choice! Well worth the money.
B00FL38PMG|5|Right when it arrived i tried it on and it's a perfect fit for me because I am petite so I ordered in size small which was the last one! Lucky enough to have gotten it cuz I fell in love once i saw this leather jacket on Amazon and it was a good price because most leather jackets are so expensive!! This one deserves to be restocked; I hope they make more from wherever they made these!!
B004R1IAWS|5|This breathable texture is really nice for doing sports.
B00UR8FF6O|5|Great tie! Wearing it today!
B00DZZPRAU|4|The product was as expected and so cute, though the unicorn had long black human hairs stuck all over it.  I had to pick 10-a dozen off so that was a bit gross.  None the less, it will make my niece happy
B00H3AR3KA|5|Very nice. Fits well. Nice quality. Good material. Pretty warm. Very good product!!
B00I5UUBXS|4|Great
B003835718|5|The tee shirts fit just the way I expected them to.  Very nice. They wash well too and dry well too.
B00GY70L1Q|5|So far, all that has been buy it as I expected.<br />This is what I was looking for. Thanks
B00FQ0YTB0|5|yes
B00CB26TA0|5|This saved me the trouble of trying to mix and match pieces. The set is truly nicely put together and is great quality- can tell it is from Europe and not the typical stuff we find in America. It was a great outfit for an occasion we had and we will use these again- even as separate pieces!
B00A418FWK|5|As expected
B00Q2FP7FU|2|Great wash- would have liked them if I could have fit into them.  I have several pairs of Joe's Jeans- all in size 28- and I couldn't even pull these up all the way.  They run VERY small.  Returning. :-(
B00KHWEJN0|5|Adorable...runs large
B007R6JPC4|5|Fast delivery :)!<br />Big backpack :D
B00F65OU5K|5|Perfect to workout in. Love it ! I'm a size 13 and I ordered an xxxl and they fit perfectly .
B00JEL6J6A|5|oh my God. This is my favorite. I was undecided to buy this dress since i don't wear much sleeveless dresses, but this one is a lovely one. I love the color, the material, the design and it gives you that bohemian look...I love how i look in this dress!!!
B00LNINFA0|5|most leggings on me are way too long , but not these! ordered 2 more pairs for work!! so comfy and cute (: love them! thank you!
B00D2LW7O6|4|Good quality and nice design.
B004UM85YC|5|Product received as advertised, fast delivery
B009DJCS7C|5|I like to wear a &#34;sleep bra&#34; at night, but I have had problems lately finding the &#34;right one&#34;.  This one is very soft, not too hard to get on, and I like the back on it.  I have found it to be very comfortable, but also fits snug, which is what I want.
B00VGLTNW8|4|I was glad I had read on other review that the suit ran small and ordered accordingly. I'm 5'7 130lbs and the large fits. I really like the suit, especially since I got it for such a great price. The only real complaint and it's just a little annoyance is that the fringe leaves black fuzz on me even after washing but it's not enough to keep me from wearing it. It was shipped to me very quick. I would definitely order from this boutique again.
B00AHIH9VS|5|These beautiful buttons look great and celebrate what makes The Doctor such a great enduring character for all of the ages...or in his case, for all your incarnations.
B00HMZU420|4|The vendor was outstanding - but these were way short - nothing like what's pictured on the website sadly. The quality was great - they fit around the waist just fine - but - I guess - being 5'10&#34; - the size 34's were just to short ...
B000PY2QWG|4|It is big, but that was expected based on the description. I am 5' 6&#34;, and it touched my heel. The material is quite thin, thinner than I was expecting. The only real issue I have with it that the clasp won't stay on. Overall not bad for the price. I would like to see the fleece kind offered in adult women sizes.
B004ZWG0NK|5|Great fit!  I'm 6'4&#34; with a 36 inseam, so I was skeptical that it would be long enough.  It is perfect and there's extra length in case it shrinks!
B001H4DPJQ|3|This case fit my iPhone 3Gs perfectly. It snaps right one. It also comes with an<br />insert for a docking station so you do not have to remove the cover to dock it.<br />There are a few things about this cover that I didn't like and ultimately made me chose to<br />go back to using my Case Crown cover. The first thing is the cover is glossy its very susceptible to<br />scratching. It was slightly scratched when I removed it from the shipping package. With its slim profile and glossiness it makes the iPhone almost as difficult to hold onto as if it had no case at all. My last complaint is its very difficult to<br />remove. I like to remove my case each day and clean my iPhone.<br />Again, going back to my Case Crown which comes off very easily, although is firmly attached to the iPhone. Plus it offers better side and corner protection than the elago does.<br /><br />I gave this product three stars because it is as advertised. But I would not buy it again. So far I am a fan of the Case Crown and would recommend that product over this.
B00JDYW1XI|5|Way cute
B0073ESIMS|3|THIS DRESS IS VERY NICE.  I CANNOT BLAME THE DRESS FOR MY WAIST.  THIS IS HIGH WAISTED AND TOO HIGH WAISTED FOR ME.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THE DRESS TO ANYONE OUT THER WHO READS MY REVIEW, HOWEVER BECAUSE IT IS REALLY NICE.
B00AA95SAI|5|The dress fit very well. A little snug but doable. There is enough sequin in there. Not too much not too little. Absolutely gorgeous.
B008O8MGBG|5|Awesome! Very sexy and classy looking! Perfect for my garter!
B007TI2STC|4|The fabric is really nice.. unfortunately i bought a bigger size since some said by a larger size.. but the pants is really nice.. i definitely recommend this pants...
B00SXBCALK|5|love it!
B00M94TCKY|1|Don't like the material its rough
B00GP1FZ5S|5|Love it
B00A9R2P7A|5|These were some pretty nice bow ties! I bought them as a gift for all my groomsmen for their rental tuxes because I cant stand clip ons. I had a bow tie that I paid $50 for myself and you couldnt really notice the difference. Fantastic product for the price!! Cant beat it
B00DVS2AMO|5|very good
B00KAD0W2S|5|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it, seriously never takes it off.
B00F0YIZN0|5|I'm 28and have a 1.5 year old son. I've always been small in the thighs and hips so I can fit into junior pants usually. I took a risk with this because I wanted more skinny jean pants that I can wear to the office without looking like jeans without the super high waist that seems to be a thing right now. So, I got the brown ones which are darker than expected--almost black--but i suspect they will fade out nicely.<br /><br />When I first got the package and tried them on they were a little tight in the legs. So, I washed them and hung them dry instead of  the drier. They were slightly more relaxed but still tight after that. I wore them anyway and, from the first day's wear, they relaxed to my form. Since then, then they've fit perfectly. Snug after a wash and then relaxed within a few hours of wear. These are my favorite non-jean pants right now. I'll be getting more in different colors.
B00FDP4SOQ|3|I bought a small for my wife, who was in her first few months of pregnancy. As some other reviewers mentioned, a small is more like a large. The design of the dress is nice, but she will have to tailor the dress to make it fit correctly.
B005LZQ0OO|5|Great selection and not to costly for growing child.  Great fit and wonderful colors.  Will purchase more in the future.  great gift ideas as well. Delivered on time and in time for birthday celebration.
B009YDTDUC|5|I got this evening shawl to go with a dress for the graduate student formal. It looked wonderful! I got many compliments on the ensemble. Be aware that it will not provide you with warmth, but is ideal for a warm to moderate evening. The event that I went to was outside and I was comfortable all evening. I should note that we were also dancing, so that also helped to keep me warm. I definitely reccommend this product. I will also say, that I followed other reviewers and washed it before wearing it. Finally, I have quite broad shoulders, and I was able to wrap it around me, you should have ample room with this shawl. I'm holding it in the picture because I thought it looked cuter that way. I hope this was helpful!
B002HJ2SOI|5|These are the first Savane Pants I ever owned; I am ordering more right away! Not only are they great pants, but, you can not ask for better service. I placed this order on a Tuesday and received the pants just two days later on Thursday with regular delivery options! I will be ordering from this person again....soon!
B00CDXMMXU|3|all fox things have a timed break over time they deteriorate after constant use
B00UNOJRXE|3|Did not like the material.  Not really soft like expected.  A little larger than expected.
B007RF6U8C|4|I like the rain coat its really cute with the dragon print however I was really hoping the liner was cotton but It's actually polyester.That's why I only gave it four stats.
B00O23CJD2|4|Positives:<br />~looks and feels like real hair<br />~color was spot on<br />~curls well in tact<br />~the netting was black (makes the netting less noticeable when the hair is parted)<br />~the bangs were very full and the netting does not show no matter how I parted them<br />~adjustable with hooks in the back<br />~comes with a wig cap<br /><br />Negatives:<br />~the wig was a little sparse around the top half of the back and on the ear flaps<br />~the bangs were very long (past my chin) but they could easily be trimmed
B0019RWWCW|1|Way too long & they charge for a return! Don't buy it unless you're a Giraffe
B0037KLF6S|5|I bought these for my 9 month old.  She has chunky thighs but they fit her perfectly.  They are long enough that she will still be able to wear them for awhile and the elastic isn't tight at all so they didn't leave marks.  They are a nice soft material and perfect with skirts or dresses during the crawling stage.  I came back to buy more for Christmas gifts.  Adorable!
B00VR2HBSE|5|so soft
B00B1ACNAS|5|Nice-looking western bomber-style jacket for 50 to 60 F weather.
B00JCQ9WWK|3|Buttons came off very easily
B0027WKHLQ|3|So this item is actually pretty decent for the price. I paid less than $10 for it, so I was expecting a VERY cheap product. But that wasn't the case at all. The material is nice and silky to the touch. Yes, it's not as glamorous as the Grand Heritage or even Deluxe editions of the costume. However, this is the only Rubie's version that is usually available in a size Small, and even that was a little too loose... so I don't have the option of the other two. I am 6' tall with a 29\\" waist and it fit pretty well except for the sleeves. They could have been 1/2 inch longer to be perfect. As others have mentioned, they were also slightly baggy. However, neither of these details severely detracts from the appearance of the costume. I actually had a lot of fun modifying it to make it better. I attached my own silver rank stripes over the dull ones that come on the shirt. I also bought a metal insignia pin to cover up the printed one... unfortunately, the printed one is bigger than the metal badge so it shows through a bit... otherwise this would have been a 4-star costume. The toughest part was removing the black dickie. If you don't mind fixing up a cheap costume to make it better, this really is a great start.
B00HSDEACG|4|good~
B00C50URMY|1|Way to small.  Ordered Xxl, and is equivalent to a large.  Sizing should be more accurate.  As explained on ad
B00B2G1D20|3|They fit fine, but the fabric is wearing away too quickly.
B003WYF9ZC|4|Just what I wanted great price arrived on time
B0018OHOPG|4|Ben using Levis shrink to fit for more years than I care to count, serviceable long lasting for me acceptable fit.
B00NQWMM3M|4|I like it alot
B009AMYRVW|5|Love it!!!! More beautiful  than the PICTURE! !!!!÷
B00E0KGZ5U|4|I got this in large and whilst it is a nice top I should have gotten the medium...but it is an easy fix...so no worries.<br /><br />The grey is a bit underwhelming but I will pair with lovely red and gold necklace and skinny jeans...<br /><br />All in all a very nice blouse...and you cant3 beat this price.
B005JJT6HU|4|Because the XXL coat I ordered from Japan was three sizes too small, I ordered a 1X coat from Roaman's.  The coat is beautiful,<br />but it's about two sizes too big.  Shopping online is a tough job.
B00CFHVHFI|5|I put this cover up on and fell in love with the fit, color and is super comfortable.  I have had several compliments and people want to know where I got it from.
B003YUU1M0|5|PERFECT AND A PERFECT PRICE! That is all I have say about that! It comes with every color headband and every color flower needed for all outfits. You can literally make a hundred different arrangements with them. Plus, they fit from infant until 12 years of age. What a bargain, and absolutely adorable! My daughter gets so many compliments and I have suggested this product to several people.
B00K8LZMMW|5|Super cute, love the color combo and love that I can mix and match with other onesies that I have for my son.
B009ZYPGL0|2|I love the design but it's way too long - not to the scale of the photo - the fabric is stiff and rough (not unlike fine grain sandpaper) and I have no interest in putting it up against my skin (maybe guys don't care but women do) - I have washed it in cold water and that removed most of the dye (they should ALL be pre-washed and softened OR you need to change the fabric) - I have a wonderful long Mountain Spririt sundress which I love but this is a big disappointment -
B001MXKF0O|5|Loved it on my girlfriend... she said it was comfortable and she is about 5'6&#34; with a very large bust... 125 lbs
B00FYF768K|2|Way too big around the waist for a medium. I know this is America but not everyone is obese. That's why there's XL and XXL
B000ISD1NW|1|Even though this didnt cost very much, the product i recieved looks terrible and feels even worse when you try to wear it.  The inside of the hook piece that goes over your hand is immediately sticky from all the glue that is smeared all over the handle.<br /><br />Definitely do not buy.
B00JH0RWYQ|5|I love this skirt!  Really comfortable and goes great with everything.  The fabric is very soft and drapes nicely, it fits me perfectly.  I am definitely planning on buying this in more colors soon, this is becoming a staple in my wardrobe!  If you are looking for a maxi skirt on Amazon, this is definitely the one to buy.
B00KH8T13W|5|We are saving this item for school, but my son loves it, and it seems sturdy enough for a  kindergarten age boy.
B00KHX18L0|5|I was very satisfied with this product. Overall it's good quality, the material is so soft, and the size fits good. I did have concern about the tops and bottoms being the same size but it fit great! I would definitely purchase more bathing suits from this company.
B00FS1XZ58|5|This shirt is awesome. When I wear it, I feel as if I have the power of He-Man pulsing in my chest. Great shirt material and size.
B00CFP6GRY|5|great
B00TT7RTHW|1|Very odd fit. I would not recommend this.
B004XFY4HS|5|Fit great! It shipped here in just 4 days.
B005A4NA6W|5|The Eric B is a great fit and looks great. With the inner lining it's a bit hot, though.
B00IKFWJLU|4|Bought this for my girlfriend.  We tried it on in a surf shop but they only had large and medium, which she usually wears.  Found it here in the small and was half the cost.  My girl loves it so win win.<br />It's a good color and hangs above the knees just above her butt.  It says juniors but this should be fine for a grown woman.
B00OZMNCOU|5|Very nice conservative shirt.  I bought it for my husband and I think he likes it.
B00EWOP1A4|5|These are wonderful bras. Very comfortable and the only ones I wear now.
B002R3OS7Y|4|I've gotten these both for myself, and as Christmas and birthday gifts for others. They're a great gift for women who you may not know well enough to be able to pick out a very personal gift, but for who you'd like to acknowledge.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- comes in a really pretty organza bag, looks lovely when presented as a gift<br />- the bigger scarf (it comes with two) is really great for the price<br />- colors are beautiful and vibrant<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- the smaller scarf that each main scarf comes with is poor quality and runs (like pantyhose) pretty easily.
B00HSE540M|4|I got the jacket with the matching pants, here are a few comments I received from friends:<br /><br />&#34;Are you going to a Kurdish wedding?&#34;<br />&#34;Where is the matching gold-plated chain?&#34;<br />&#34;You need more chest hair&#34;<br />&#34;Is this a costume?&#34;<br />&#34;Would look great in the Sopranos&#34;
B000HBODSC|1|First, the picture on this product is deceiving, and not what mine looked like. More importantly, I'm not even sure the product inside the container is actually Clinique Repairwear, which I've used for several years. Comparing it to what is left in my own Clinique Repairwear container purchased from a Clinique counter at a department store, the color is clearly different. Additionally, the texture is not thick and creamy like the product I am used to, and is instead watery, even after mixing. I will never buy an \\"unboxed\\" product again, and would caution others to do the same.
B00GM0RCIU|5|Life is too short to wear boring socks! These fit nicely and I love the colors!
B00H7BS714|4|Daughter Loves Them!  Quality was above what was expected!
B00ACIGU7W|5|Great
B003EIT1LY|5|I bought this shirt as a gift for my brother.  Shortly afterwards he landed a medical residency in Tucson, AZ.  Coincidence?  Hardly.  Best present ever? Definitely.
B00C4659FO|3|The color was true, the cloth soft, full length, so all of that good. Still this product is double the cost it should be.
B0037J7ZUY|2|cheap and flimsy. i'm 6'2&#34; so its too short for me and the way it grips does not give me confidence. the quality reflects the cheap price.
B00FXQ1UFA|4|The three T-Shirts on this page were as described and were as I expected. Fit,and color were perfect..Wear the t-shirts and like them..
B00MN7REYI|5|Love, love, Love!!! Fits as expected, but don't order too big. You don't want it loose. Looks incredible on!
B00FMXAR6C|5|Beautiful glove. Soft leather, well constructed. Good value for the money and fit true to size.
B009QA1928|5|I am 5'6&#34; 140 pounds 34DDD-28-36 and I am always skeptical of the one size fits most but I took the chance with this and I am so happy that I did. When I first opened the package I thought there was no way this was going to fit me because it looked like it was going to be way too tight as well as way too short but I tried it on anyway. It fit perfectly and I have ordered multiple colors and if you want to enhance and flatter your breast then wear a strapless bra underneath and all eyes will be on you.
B00ESYAZ0O|1|I brought this hat and its fugly I'm very disappointed because this hat doesn't look ANYTHING like the picture and it's too small I want my damn money back😠😠😠!!!!!
B00KZMD98I|4|I am 6'0&#34; and weigh 185 and the large size is slightly big on me. Other than that I like the coat.
B00CDIDD0Q|5|excelente producto
B003AU5WEG|1|You get what you pay for! The material is very thin and scratchy. The tags in the back of the neck will scratch you and the arms of the shirt were made for a person with small fore arms.
B00DYIH490|4|This set is pretty neat looking but the quality is definitely low, but what do you expect for that price? The suspenders will wear out pretty quickly. I suggest setting the size once and never changing it, because each change will tear up the elastic. Worth the price for something that you expect to wear out quickly.
B001AS6CWG|5|Sent me another model but ok
B00IK45Y0O|5|Loved this dress.. Got tons of compliments
B00PAA0Z28|5|fit very well i did not know how the medium what have fit thank God i got the medium and not the small .i love nautica clothes
B00C3AWTCC|5|I am very pleased with this purchase.  I keep one in my gym bag, and it is perfect for hot and humid locker rooms because it is light weight, yet comfortable.  I am 5' 6&#34; and weigh 158 lbs.  The Velcro straps are appropriately placed to fit me well.  Would like to have one for home also.
B00KB99X44|1|Way too small!
B003PC2MOC|5|Great shirt just know that it will be over sized. I ordered the size I normally would and the shirt was down to my knees. Didn't shrink in the wash either, so I just wear it tucked into my pants. Still a cool shirt.
B000N8Q2P6|5|I use these as work jeans whenever i'm tinkering on my own cars, they have held up well to slag from welding, getting grazed by broken cut off wheels, fiberglass resin, paint, axle grease, ect. They are amazingly resilient for the money. The belt loops accept a good thick belt and are spaced appropriately so they work well with several of my preferred holsters for CCW.
B00M7N9N7O|3|The shirt is very cute but I was slightly disappointed that the colors turned out to be neon pink and blue instead of pastel. Also it turned out to be more of a crop top than i expected. It got to my house within a week and fit me pretty well, although its really high up on the neck.
B006JAPP64|4|This belt is good quality and well made. You can take off the belt buckle if you want. I love it!
B00M7CHJW6|5|Looks better in person, I got lots of compliments and it was the bright gold I wanted for my outfit. I purchased a size larger than my normal size and it fit amazing. Exceeded my expectations.
B000UJC7FM|3|I actually returned mine and got a cold weather parka from LL Bean. It is much superior to this in quality and warmth, but cost 3x as much. For the price this is pretty good I guess...
B00GYI16G4|5|I was surprised how nice this dress is for the price. It looks great dressed down with a sweater, leggings, and boots. Or dressed up with just heels.
B00IRW8KLO|4|Love the shirt. Collar is bigger than I expected
B001S9ZW1O|5|Purchased these for my 93 year old mom.  Couldn't find any local that were good and also affordable.  She'll be ordering more.
B008172NOK|3|Stainless the first wearing and nothing worked to remove the stains
B008775JQS|2|I found the, uncomfortable so I gave them away.
B00TLB4V6I|5|Good
B00AHNI7GO|5|These shirts fit well, are comfortable, and of good quality.  The color hasn't faded and the fabric has not shrunken despite multiple washes.  I would recommend.
B002I55DT8|1|took it out of the bag and half the feathers fell off all over the floor. not worth the money
B00R25NHYW|4|Everything was as expected. Quick delivery, true size and true color.
B00LO3IIW4|5|My 3-year-old daughter loves it and will fit into it for years.
B00MP1ZG92|5|Great
B005LMUWW8|5|Because of the wide lace elastic band that functions like elastic but absolutely doesn't bind or grip tightly, this slip's waistband is very comfortable. I can't bear other slips with thin little elastic. They squeeze too tight and give me gas! Yuck! But this slip is comfortable which make me comfortable too! I have four already, but am still looking for a black 16 inch. This slip I'm reviewing is a 16 inch. I also have two 18 inch slips, which are longer (haha obviously!).
B009NV3STW|5|excellent i love it great quality
B00ATNZ3F0|1|I hate it<br />Too big<br />No one the pants where too wide i ment to get a slim fit size
B0001ZU8H4|5|I travel quite a bit and while I have never lost anything since locks have been forbidden or at least frowned upon by airport security the new tsa approved locks provide an added sense of peace of mind. Easy to use and no keys to remember or lose.
B008VPR8EW|5|Slinky feeling - - have to order more! Wish there were more color choices. On a cold night they feel wet.
B00HAZP7Q0|5|Love them! Super comfortable
B00WG4QXFY|1|Bad
B00FF1J6WM|5|Just to let you know that everything fited very well i'm very heppy as usual......<br />and i will continue to have bussness with you guysssss...
B008727P06|5|I absolutely love this costume!  I am 5'9&#34; 140 lbs and this costume was a perfect fit.  Warning.......if you wash this the blue metallic will come off!  I was devastated and had to purchase another, it was my fault.  the corset is adjustable in the back.  I originally found this at a local store for almost twice the $$$.  I highly recommend this
B00WQL9Q6K|1|Color is not the green you see in the picture its more of a bright yellow and the arms are very tight. 5'4 145lbs Med fit me but is very snug. Now very skeptical about items that come from China!
B00CHQ50C8|4|My boyfriend loved it although it was a little big on him. Still keeps him nice and warm when he takes the trash out when it's cold out! Good awarm material. I Would reccommend it
B00A3I5CR0|1|Big disappointment. Everything looked good in the description although the length wasn't stated. The waist was way too big. When I put them on they fell right to my ankles. A tag on the shorts said something like fits below the waist and hangs below the knees. Too bad that wasn't in the online description.<br /><br />I've had bad luck with shorts recently; I really have to go into a store and try them on to be sure they fit.
B009P4FB60|3|I guess if you are a thin person these would fit, but with it saying it is a 3XL I thought it would fit a bigger person, wrong. I am a size 22 and there is no way they would fit.  I sent them back and got a refund.  Runs very small in size.
B002LLCFXQ|5|Very nice product, shipped promptly.  Thank you.
B008IGHRYA|5|I love it!  It is so comfortable and looks great on.  I received so many compliments when I wore it.  Definitely a favorite with my husband, too!!
B0095GKUXM|1|not actually hidden socks as advertised- disappointing - these are ankle socks
B0016BVDLM|5|These are a great price and super cute!  My daughter loves them, and says they feel good!
B00HAV6T3Y|4|The skirt was alright and it fit perfecly but when I opened up the package it smelled bad. Really wish it wouldn't smell like that
B00O8RAXI0|5|nice!
B002VLW7E8|2|I don't need my 15 year old with Pot symbols on his gloves. I am sure the gloves do what they are intended to keep your hands warm. But the graphics I am not for, sorry we are not all in Colorado and agree with Pot smoking.
B00MPR5XX0|4|Hear from a person that bought these for years, she said there not that warm and you use different material now.
B00I815WWY|5|Beautiful skirt.  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I love that the skirt actually reaches my ankles.  As a tall woman, this does not often happen.
B009T5DQG2|5|I ordered the 34 GG and the band is a wrap-around. I wasn't sure how it worked, so I contacted the seller. Once you hit the GG cup, the band is a wrap-around and not just your traditional clasp - FYI. Its so supportive and cute. I've never been able to find a larger top that fit so well until this one. I also wear Panache bras too.
B004SK6EEO|5|i love it it shipped fast it is better then i had hoped i would and have told friends of it's quality
B00F4WT9B0|5|Loved it.
B00ARTOC1W|5|Very pretty sweater with ruffled collar, flower shaped buttons and embroidery.  Will be worn a lot since my granddaughter seems to find it comfortable.
B001JBNDLM|5|Difficult to find a true 35&#34; waist.  These briefs fit.  I always wore Hanes, but Hanes sizes are 32-34 and 36-38.  They were always slightly big or small, but Fruit of the Loom seemed thin and poor quality.  Thought I'd give them another try.  Quality of these Fruit of the Loom is excellent.  Recommend them.  Price is right too.
B00JGRRUMY|3|The fit is too small for a medium.  You need to order a size up or even two for it to fit right.  It is not sweatshirt material which would be thicker.  It is made of T-shirt material.
B00F1CRRW6|5|Shipping was fast, product was as described.
B00CF2VMQW|5|was a gift for my husband for his birthday! fits nicely, he loves it. 👍
B00HCO2UUA|4|This a really good quality kilt. I like it a lot. The sizing is a bit off and should be a little more flexible. A extra set of snaps would be handy. I am a size 38 pants, I had an extra large but it was too big, the large is snug. Otherwise I love it.
B00J6Q222S|2|The bottom of the skirt is odd
B00W0HQZAA|1|I felt like the quality was not very good.
B00ID4XSF4|4|This is a great product. The only discrepancy is that when the manufacturer finished  sewing the material, he/she did not bother to remove a lot of extraneous thread and strings of material. So we had to do that during the first wash. Otherwise, I like the fit and feel very much.
B006U1EM66|3|they are very warm and get the job done but I bought them because when I style my hair I don't want to put a hat on. However, they pinch and hurt my ears. If you wear them with a ballcap and the tops rest on the cap and not your head they're great.
B00IV60ZMS|5|SUPER cozy! I love them! They are a bit big, so I would recommend going down a size, I bought an XL, wish I would've gotten a L, but no biggie!! They're great quality, highly recommended.
B00UVAGCW4|5|thank the lord i bought these! looks amazing on my larger body. I am so happy about these!
B00BJNP2H8|5|Love the scarf and a great price!
B0066STTYI|4|Package came on time as always. The bodystocking looks awesome on my girlfriend and of course the open crotch makes love making very enjoyable. Definitely shows off her beautiful curves.
B00B80RGVW|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I have absolutely no complaints! The shipping was right on time and the material of the shirt is very durable! Plus it is really authenticated with the WWE authentication tag! I would definitely recommend this! It is AWESOME!
B00QDD352I|4|Nice quality for the price, going to buy several more colors. Very dense paisley pattern on the tie.
B00OLPHW5Q|5|Cute
B00CPWBE4C|5|I think every working man should have this accesories. It will. Help you to give back the look of your collars, becasue the collar stays that nirmally com with your shirts bend and give back look
B00O2XKJV6|4|Great love it
B002NPC2RY|5|Excellent Dockers jean. very good quality. I ordered Docker classic fit jean pants and got exactly what I requested. The order arrived on time. These jean are very comfortable.I love these pants. It fit just right and is worth the price. The color was exactly as in the picture.
B0048DY1V4|2|I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this item. It didn't fit very well as it was smaller than what the chart had said. It also didn't support me either. It was priced well and arrived in a timely manner though.
B00K5MXFXC|5|love it
B004FGMYN6|4|Seems fine, not yet used much
B00IR57G8E|5|This pats are awesome good quality and washable friendly no shrinkage. Love the pants just make sure to get a size 1 higher then ur regualer size to get that perfect fit.
B00A1PXYUC|3|Cute outfit but difficult to fit large bust
B00TR76WW2|3|For the price, these are great! The design is adorable and they are VERY soft! I'd definitely buy these again and I would also recommend them to anyone. I will make an update in the future in regard to how well they soak up spit up and if they last a long time.<br /><br />Edit - These bibs do not have any type of backing that is &#34;waterproof&#34;. It is all just a thin cloth material. If your baby drools a lot, the drool with soak right through and onto their shirt. We still got a lot of use out of them, but I had to either double up or change them out multiple times during the course of the day (more than the average). I wish liquids didn't soak right through the back... that was a bit disappointing.
B00457WW8M|5|I bought this for my daughter after her little girl was born.  I wasn't sure about the size but it fit perfectly.<br />she is very happy with it.
B004JF5XUY|5|VERY COMFORTABLE AND HOLDS ITS SHAPE AFTER WASHING
B00DT3QLMQ|3|Soft and luxurious, beautiful quality. But the sizing is way out of whack.  I ordered a 7.5, my size…I couldn’t get it on my hand!  According to their sizing, I would have to order 10.0!  I’ll be returning them, too bad!
B004J1D2HO|5|cool buckles originally sent the wrong buckle but sent me the correct one within days  It was exactly as it is shown in picture.  nice going cool buckles
B003UQBQWW|4|Very cute design and perfect for my first grader.  Plenty of room for all the homework, folders, gym shoes, etc..  We had her name embroidered on the outside pocket for a personal touch.
B00591HDO6|1|i like their shoes more wont buy a suit from DC again
B00H69OTIM|5|I think these are great!  Love the size assortment, the container to keep them organized, that they're not flimsy like most of the stays that come with shirts, and not hard on shirts like I think the metal ones are.  Very affordably priced, too.
B002974T2C|5|It fits a little big, but that was a good surprise. It gives a little growing room. It is even prettier than it looks online. Made very well, with great materials. I was worried when I ordered it because I'd never heard of this company,  but what a great experience. This coat IS lined with a soft cool material. I can't say enough about this product. It was a little pricey, but well worth the price and the wait.
B00A9S1GYC|3|Make sure you buy size that your daughter (or son...) will grow into.  Like their Carter clothes, these sizes run small.
B000BGWFT2|5|I love this robe set, the colors are beautiful and vibrant and the material is very soft and comfortable.
B003SRQNLM|4|I like this bi-fold.  It appears to be made from a premium leather and has a great texture.  It looks like a premium product.  Did not test the RFI protection, so I have no idea how effective it is.  Four stars because it is smaller than expected.  It is a standard size in dimensions, but it does not hold as many cards, etc., as other bi-folds I have owned.
B00CEVACTC|3|Like I said, these are better than nothing but not a whole lot better.Due to the type of material they seems to pick up the cold pretty easy.
B00AU4NYSG|5|good
B00NCDGHEA|3|sizing isn't perfect.  maybe works better on a shorter man. I am near 6' so if I get it in the right length , the collar drops too low.
B000N8X5I8|2|I had no idea that fabric could be this stiff. They remind me of those uncomfortable tough jeans from when I was a kid except I think these are stiffer.<br />I had to wash and dry them 5 or 6 times before they could be worn - just kept cycling them through with other loads of laundry. Even with all that washing, they are still stiff but they can be worn.<br />The cut is very full. I thought they would shrink up more than they did. It probably would have been a good idea for me to order an inch smaller than normal in the waist.<br />So -<br />They are ok.<br />They are more rigid than I'd like.<br />They will probably wear well and last a long time.<br />They will be worn, but I wouldn't want to purchase another pair of these.
B00LSV5PHI|5|This dress its beautiful! It fit perfectly. The lace detail made it so elegant.
B003XRP3FO|5|This was the perfect addition to the Steve Zissou outfit I made for my husband. Thanks!
B00M8EBF28|4|I received my order on time and couldn't wait to try it on.  I ordered one size up per the review on this item and it fit perfect.  Did not think the material was too thin but will see when I decide to wear it.
B00P0RCJNO|5|Wow! I'm 5'9 160 and the XL was flattering in all the right ways. Great material and arrived quickly. Totally buying the orange one too.
B00BNRYTKQ|4|I have no idea what &#34;slimming technology&#34; means, but these jeans are made of the softest denim, with just enough stretch and they really did make me look thinner.  I am a 12 and I've got hips, but the dark color and cut of the jean minimizes them.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they are realy long.  I'm 5'4&#34; and I would need to wear 5 inch heels to make them not drag on the ground.  I wish they came in diff. lengths.
B0002TOTME|5|I have been wearing Gold TOe Compression Support Socks for years for edema.  They work.  These socks fulfilled my need for new ones.
B009I51Y4O|4|I love the shirt! It was a little smaller than I thought, but I still wear it!
B0058GP6F0|5|My mom bought this pant as a gift from me to her, she wears it every day!!! Great product, good looking and comfortable
B00AN7HDGO|2|I ordered size small and it fits like a large or extra large. It looks like it would fit a big man. The design and color is too loud for me too. It has to go back.
B00EPDXQHM|4|It fits slightly smaller but the material is stretchy.  The material is also thin, almost see through The material has a nice texture to it, and wrinkles come out easily.  It looks nice, and is comfortable too.  I wore it to a renaissance fair and it got very muddy, but after a soak it came clean.<br />I received it sooner than expected.
B00K1LEWWA|4|Nice pj's .thay feel very nice to sleep in. Thay do run big.
B00KSGF10U|5|Good quality, very pleased with purchase.
B006QWJMG4|5|I love this shirt. It looks great with jeans,capris and cargos. The tank shapewear underneath is soft and stretchy. I was concerned it would be hot to wear in the summer but I wore on recent trip to the tropics and I was comfortable. I would love to by it different colors but I don't like pink.  For me it runs a little big though I wouldn't order a size down.
B00L3Y32DY|2|Got what I paid for.  Had to take out the pathetic bones and then was able to use it.
B00BR2KY92|5|Awesome shirt, there was a mix up and seller sent me what I wanted, ended up with 2 Maiden shirts! Can't get better than that. Great deal, great seller.
B00UHPEOK0|4|Nice shirt. Decent stitching, material, and design. Would buy more from this line.
B00R3O6WQM|3|To big
B00NPVI33M|5|Beautiful coat.  Nice fit. Came right away.
B00A4E7V0Y|2|Very tight/form fitting. I'm 5'9&#34; and 160lb. Ordered XL and returned it.
B0038M1XSK|5|My girl loves wearing this for her ballet class.  It fits perfectly, is very comfortable, and beautifully designed.  Would definitely buy again.
B0018P1WO4|2|The shorts themselves are fine as far as material, workmanship, etc.  The reason I only gave it 2 stars is because with Levi's you cannot trust the sizing.  A week before I bought these 505 shorts I purchased a pair of 505 jeans, both in size 32 waist.  The shorts were 2 inches bigger in the waist than the jeans.  I have noticed this difference between different styles of Levi's jeans many times before, but this is the first time it has happened with the same style.  I contacted Levi's customer support, and they basically blew me off - said it wasn't possible, that at the max there could only be a variance of 1/2 inch between jeans with the same sizes.  We have been led to believe through the years that sizing on men's pants, waist x inseam, is listed in inches. They are not! I have thought that those numbers are solely arbitrary for a long time, and verified my suspicions by googling it.  I bought the shorts online because they are next to impossible to find in stores, but will think twice about doing it again.[[ASIN:B001UQ6TSA Levi's Men's 505 Straight Fit Short]]
B00211M13K|1|I am a small person- but I cannot get these socks up over my calves without cutting off the blood supply. There is no elasticty in the sock so they are painful to wear and do not stretch. I am SO disappointed as I bought 6 pair for a Dirty Girl run team and no one can fit in them.
B0073ARU5I|4|Nice jacket and it came in pretty quick.
B00QIV1HLQ|5|good stuff for babies
B00CI077BU|2|can't wear it at all.  too small waist and too fluffy
B0088ERHI8|4|el vestido encaja con la descripción lo único es que el tipo de tela es muy decepcionada para lo que se describía, por lo demás, muy bien, el color y la forma que cae el vestido en los hombros me encanta
B00F1B8I5W|5|they run a little small but they are very cool
B00H7J2TRE|5|I like it.
B008QV880E|5|I bought this little dress for my two granddaughters to wear in their uncle's wedding. The dresses are well made and both little girls feel like they look like princesses!
B008YU8VJA|4|It is nice
B005J37164|3|I really like snazaroo face paint, but I would suggest going ahead and getting the larger size of each color.  This just isn't much paint.  And it was actually a lot dryer and harder to bring it to a paintable consistency.  maybe just because of the smaller size it dries out more.
B00DP8TVMM|5|Great value.  The jacket was a little loose around the waist but other than that it was great.
B00HX9ZJ70|5|Very cool in everything
B00W8PE3XK|5|I found these to be comfortable and ft well.
B0012OC57Y|5|this shirts is very good.
B00URX4QU0|5|Beatifull
B00JARJBZO|5|Good, well liked
B00BSXDMYO|3|Very thin material but you gt what you pay for.  I ordered the XXL as I have an 18&#34; neck and 35/36 arms. I find this to be big at an XL.
B00BBGO01M|5|BOUGHT FOR MY CO-WORKER; SHE LOVES IT AND ITS A PERFECT SIZE; SHES NOT ONE TO WEAR SCARFS BUT SHE WILL WRAP AROUND HER WAIST WHICH LOOKS SUPER CUTE ON HER
B00PG92JBS|5|This shirt is beautiful and soft and perfect for a yoga practice. I'm not sure why someone would complain that's it's too small. I ordered my size and it fit perfectly. I don't want a baggy shirt falling to my shoulders in down dog. It's supposed to fit snuggly so it doesn't ride up.
B002NQTALO|5|fit very well
B00SYB9B84|1|Very thin and see through!
B00R56X0P4|4|I feel like it's a little bigger than other Azules skirts that I've ordered.... The same size maxi skirt fits just right but this one is pretty loose.
B0092KLO04|1|bad!
B002ATVZE4|5|Even more than I expected.  Very fine pair of pants.  Additionally the front pockets are constructed properly so that I don't lose  small things out of them, like my pocket knife, every time I sit down in an easy chair!  And, lesser pants are not much, if any, less expensive!  I'll surely be buying more Dockers.
B00AY8M3U8|5|Fits 5 yr old daughter like a glove, even after 50+ hot wash/hot dry cycles. Nice touch with the zipper flap to avoid catching skin. I purchased another because it's exactly what I was looking for. Lightweight, all cotton, sturdy, adorable prints, survives hot wash/dry cycle.<br />I wish they would produce size 6,7 and 8 footed pjs!
B008CXUPTI|5|Amazon has EXCELLENT prices for Ike Behar shirts.  My son wore Ike Behar shirts often when he is going to semi-formal events and wears them during the holidays for parties.
B000685PV0|2|Definitely not one size fits all.  Way too bulky.  And way too big for the average woman.
B00C9XQ1HM|5|SO CUTE
B004W18S2K|5|The fit was perfect, great quality and made in the U.S.A. !
B00PUX7AXC|5|I love the color of these pants. I wore this to wprk with my Calvin Klein Khaki jacket and I received so many compliments. I wore a basic white blouse and some tan/khaki shoes with the pants. I love the fit. CK pants always hug my curves in the right places. I may order the blazer to make a suit of it. It comes with a belt and the fabric is light weight. It's great for spring and summer wardrobe updates.
B00THOFN3O|4|It's a fairly large wallet ... credit cards fit very tightly in the slots.
B005OTFNJA|3|I wear a six or an eight for my dress size, and I ordered a large coat. It is very tight across the chest. I am going to have the buttons moved, so it will not be so tight.
B00DQV3P0C|3|These are adorable, however they are tight fitting through the tummy and they only have three snaps down the leg which means big gaps .....probably needs four or more snaps for coverage.
B00GFTO3IU|5|My granddaughter loves them
B00MTAB170|3|Not bad for the price but I don't expect to be wearing it next winter.
B00SWT41OM|5|Very nice
B00JFGYM7M|5|nice colour. :)
B0007CKMO0|5|Very comfortable jeans!  Fast delivery and fit as expected.
B00GBUCX44|5|Great
B00FGGCL6Y|5|it was a hit size is as is did not had any problem i thought it was going to be big or to small as im always sacre of buying from the internet but this time it was a hit thank you for you been so perfect on the size it made it so easy and nice for me:) a++ on my book
B00CL7C2QU|2|Ordered size 10-12 for my averaged sized girl. It was very tight.
B000N86WHO|5|Its amazing what you can find on Amazon!! Got these for a stocking stuffer for my husband who is a serious \\"The Crow\\" lover. These are great!!
B00FY7VE9K|4|Great skirt, fits well and the material is of nice quality.
B00KG2WAIW|5|Cute and awesome for my Disney trip.
B00382OQXE|4|The fit is small. It is a good costume, even if it does fit a little small.
B00HQA1AP6|5|Hard to find a yellow shirt this time of year - it's nice!
B00M9655PI|1|Doesn't look or feel like the picture. Feels more like that rough lacey material that bows for packages are made out of.
B00NBSDMNU|4|Comes with super cute baby kangaroo, but... no button or anything to keep baby 'Roo in the pouch! Whoops! Super soft fabric, too.
B00DBRVA6M|5|FABULOUS
B00519BD9C|5|Must have during pregnancy...makes your bras more comfortable.
B00IZAKG2O|1|Did not match review for sizing as described. Pretty disappointing. Asian-style-sizing.
B00QKP068K|5|So cute, well made, and fits as expected.
B007KLZB74|5|Warm and a good<br />fit. Material is soft. I have not washed them yet so not sure how they hold up in washer.
B00RL3GTCM|5|so cute, fabric is high quality, print is adorable
B000TNDGXQ|2|This dress was only okay, so I returned it.  I wear a 12 and ordered the 1X because of reviews; I found it a bit large and probably could have gone down a size.  The big problem is the proportions, though: the waist is too high, the neckline too low, and there is no shape at the back or natural waist (there is a tie-back, but right under the bustline).  Overall it looked shapeless and blah.  That said, I thought the material was good and the rhinestones seemed sturdy.
B004NS16I0|5|This is his third &#34;Old Guys&#34; shirt.  Realizing that he'd just about worn out his first one, I turned to Amazon to find a new one. (We'd gotten the others at assorted tourist locations.)  Since he recently retired from the military and it was approaching the Fourth of July, I thought this would be a great fit for him.
B00FG37G9O|5|These are the only Camis I wear.....truly are one size fits most and are nice & long!!
B00OXPIAUK|5|I love my Hat!  I had read other reviews about the hat arriving smashed and I was prepared for the worst. Well I received my hat in a large bag (approx. 11x 14).  The top of the hat was smashed. I ironed a wet hand towel over the hat and it came out perfect. It took me all of 10 minutes to iron it. The hat is  beige in color which is exactly the color I wanted.  I don't have any complaints and for $10 this was a bargain.  I will be wearing my hat on a cruise.  Again, I love it.
B00W3IHLQ8|4|Thank you to those who wrote reviews on this dress! They gave me the heads up that it ran on the small side and therefore I should go one size up. I'm normally a medium so I ordered a large and it fit perfect! The belt however was too big and I had to make an additional hole for it to fit better. Other than that, I love it!
B006GMMITC|3|I only wish I would have ordered a c or d because my breasts are a little wide set to avoid pushing them together! Can't beat the price even if you're not sure.
B00Q6OK6A8|5|nice gloves
B00FE0G3VG|3|This is a little smaller than I expected… Even the size of ladies wallet.  Styling is very cute,  but it only has a snap closure  which pops open revealing the credit card slot.  Would only use this inside another person as this would not be safe as a clutch
B00HWFCIX8|1|Not as expected. These are not shorts. They go down to my ankles and I'm 5&#34;7 + bought a small.
B00PWZCW0Y|4|It's a bandana. It did come over-dyed and as I washed it and wrung it out in the sink, water was pink. After a few seconds of that, I dropped it in a vinegar bath for 30 minutes and it was fine after that. It is thin, like every other bandana I've ever seen. But it's perfectly functional. Dimensions were pretty spot on. I measured mine at 21&#34; x 22&#34; which is perfectly acceptable to me (advertised as 22&#34; x 22&#34; and sewing is not an exact science).<br /><br />One negative -- besides the over dying which is standard on these things: It is made in the USA, and that is good. But I don't see, feel or notice a quality difference in either the stitching of the edges or the quality of the fabric or the dye between it and Chinese-manufactured bandanas on sale for $1 at my local big box store. Look: Bandanas are not unique items. I get it. Expecting more from one than from another is probably a stretch, as they are known for their &#34;sameness.&#34; And in that regard, this is a perfectly fine bandana. I just find that it doesn't stand out, apart or above any others mass produced in other countries.
B00RD4M1GC|5|perfect fit and looks great
B002AMW6SU|5|I love The Splendid leggings!  I now own 6 pairs!  They are so soft and I can dress them up or down and wear them everywhere.  I am 5.3 , 117 pounds, and pregnant so I got the medium.  When I am not pregnant and weigh 110 pounds or less the small fits perfectly.
B00IS083N0|3|Be cautious when ordering, this is tiny.  It's otherwise very pretty.
B003YJBYPE|1|first time ever i got something i hated on amazon :( they are very low quality and break apart into little pieces causing a complete mess - just really bad low quality -
B00HRS5FWQ|1|I purchased this blouse as a Christmas gift for my sister, who is very fashion-forward. The shirt arrived timely, especially considering it came all the way from China. However, when it arrived, it was not at all what I expected. The material was cheap and stretchy, and it was far too small. It reminded me more of a Halloween costume than a blouse.<br /><br />When I went to return it, the vendor suggested that I keep the shirt and she reimburse me several dollars rather than have me go to the expense of paying for shipping back to China. I appreciated the gesture and agreed, but I have yet to see the reimbursement on my account more than a month later. Hopefully someone at Good Will will enjoy the shirt because, needless to say, it did not become part of my sister's Christmas gift.
B00BYSF3RM|4|I like the platex pantie I like a cotton pantie in the summer these sre so comfortable I recommend this product.
B00FO1RNKU|5|I live in Florida so I have several bathing suits and I FINALLY found one that fits my body shape perfectly!!!!  I'm 5'6&#34; and 115lbs.  M top and S bottom :)  LOVE LOVE LOVE Sheridyn!
B00RBL0NPI|5|Love this top! Pictures don't do it justice. The fit is awesome and it's easily dressed up or down. It hits me a little lower than in the picture, I got a regular size small, maybe should have gone with petite, I'm only 5'2, but I like where it falls below the hip. Love Trina Turk and the fact that Amazon carries this designer label.  Update: In response to the other &#34;reviews&#34;, perhaps comments regarding sticker shock should be kept among your friends and on other places online instead of the product review section. Why give a product you haven't physically analyzed a bad review solely due to being unfamiliar with a certain label's prices? Maybe I take it back and Amazon shouldn't carry designer labels seeing as how their audience isn't familiar with the proper etiquette and protocol of review writing nor the common price ranges for said designer labels.
B000WNQ4BY|4|I purchased these for minion costume and was pleased.  My son acutally wore them to play in an early snow (I hadn't updated snow pants yet) and they worked well for keeping him warm with long johns underneath.
B00CP8MA44|5|My mother is a big M&M fan and this T-shirt was a hit at her birthday party!
B00DQ5246Y|5|love the pants.  Just too small. Will reorder in larger size
B00A0L8TSY|5|These leggings are smooth and silky on the outside and fleecy on the inside.  They seem plenty stretchy and should be perfect to wear this winter.
B008L5F1LY|5|Love them great assortment
B000WLPWAK|5|Great polo - I highly recommend it. The material is very stretchy and light - perfect to wear during the summer.
B008BF5PLA|5|I use them all the time!  I love being able to use my phone while I still have gloves on!
B00L45HHIS|3|I ordered one size bigger than normal. Comfort of the jean skirt is nice. However, the quality of the garment is not as high as the cost should have been.
B003WJXKTO|5|Beautifully made. A wonderful addition to my prayer life. I recommend this item and seller. Didn't have any issues with shipment and actually received it BEFORE scheduled delivery date.
B00O7VMVNC|5|Sturdy stitching and nice colors
B00G51R92U|3|I'm no super model but its pretty sexy-after a minor adjustment. The lowest strap was way too big for me, but was quickly fixable. The lace bits thin so care's required. Not bad for the price, stuffs so overpriced elsewhere.
B00PT964GQ|5|Love it!
B00GHTMASI|5|Beautifully made shirt.  Very nice.
B001E0YYK2|5|This cowboy shirt was a birthday gift and the person just loved it. I got it in a timely manner, excellent quality, color, design, material, and the right price. I would highly recommend this beautiful               western shirt.
B0063IO5HC|5|These g strings are the most comfortable Ones I ownFeels like I'm wearing nothing but with the support.
B00DTW3N5K|5|My 3 year old loves it. I got the 5t and it fit well. He normally wears 4t, so the shirt runs a little small. But, its well made and the Velcro that holds the cape is strong.
B00B5PHXUO|5|I bought 8 of these bow ties in various colors for a lawyer friend of mine. I was a bit skeptical because it was such a good deal. Too good to be true??? Absolutely not, they were each well made and a great hit. My friend loved each of them. The shipping was a bit on the high end to get them in time for Christmas, but worth it.
B00NNPUICO|2|It's too small. I wonder it wouldn't suit for my daughter when the summer commes.
B009SKQ8OA|5|My grandson was thrilled to get this shirt and the quality of the fabric was excellent and the sleeve adornment perfect.
B004NE62UQ|5|I bought these bandanas to use for my windows as decorations. I put them over a lodgepole pine held up by horseshoes and they are my 'curtain'!!!  they were perfect for what I needed!!!!!
B00JOPC6JU|5|It is wonderful, it looks like a Valentino, I'm very pleased with my purchase and with the seller, My jacket  arrived today , it is really a short time.
B000N3X8XA|4|none
B000NRRNEQ|4|Gives great protection from the sun without overheating your head. Very fashionable as well.
B00S68191M|1|I ordered a medium and the dress fits me as a long SHIRT. It is TOO short as a dress. When my height is 4'11! That is quite absurd.
B00DFV2VYO|4|matches my dress real nice. looks and fit nice.
B003R7LD1I|5|They are soooo comfortable, and great for either casual wear or for working out.  They stay dry, and prevent foot odor no matter how hard you're working out.  I want to wear them all the time - guess I need to order more!
B00ILA7MYS|4|Nice quality shirt.
B005P0CTK4|4|This costume is super cute, it fits perfectly on top.  However, it is SUPER short.  I would not say that I have a long torso and I needed to buy some boy shorts to go underneath or let's just say it would be inappropriate.
B00LAF0R2U|5|I'm actually glad it is slightly bigger than most 2T sizes.  My daughter grows so fast that having it with room to grow helps.  The length was the only issue, so I hemmed it and can take it out as she gets taller.  She loves the PJs!
B00Z1GXPG4|3|you need other lengths
B00C179WAY|4|Very comfortable long sleeve T. Material is great, only a little static-y with no undershirt. Sizing is accurate and the sleeve length is proportional.
B00EP1FSUM|5|I like a wallet with windows for ID's . I hate tri-folds so this one is perfect!
B00HWNOWLG|3|BIEN
B00CXSN8MY|4|Runs a little small but not too bad. Others may want to get a bigger size to make sure it fits good
B00OAL0758|3|I Love The material its soft But in The waist is too small
B00FP39KJ4|4|Nice breathable cotton socks. Barely show from inside shoe unlike another brand i tried. Only wish they were a tad thicker. Would recommend.
B0078YZ7HW|5|This costume is so cute! It was well made and affordable. You can't see it in the picture but it has a really cute tail in the back.
B008ZAZ908|2|Way too oversize - mostly too long and feet too big.  It did not fit well and I could not make it work, so I had to return it.  It was nice and heavy, but the fit was too poor.
B00HK50EEK|5|I bought these for a friend and she says they fit well
B00DUNMGXI|4|Gave as a gift, person likes oversized loose fitting shirts, so it was nice to see that larger sizes were offered. Worked out great and the recipient loves it.
B00I4R3EV8|5|Verry good, muy bueno excelente atención. Rápida entrega
B00NK2DOQM|4|Nice shirt. Runs smaller than expected But Great transaction.
B00BT1FHC0|3|I bought these to match a pair of jeans.  I'm a &#34;depression baby&#34; so everything I buy just has to &#34;match&#34;.
B002IGN8JO|4|Very effective
B00XQLH6EI|5|I got this as a gift for my son in law. He is Dad to 4 daughters! He absolutely loved it! It is a cottonblend shirt so it's pretty soft fabric. Pre shrunk so no worries there. I got a discount on this product for my honest review and I really do recommend this shirt!
B004HEYOPM|5|I ordered these for a grandchild, and these are just beautiful shirts.<br />They fit  perfectly and they are very well made.<br />The uniform shirts look adorable on her, as they are more girlie than than the uni-sex shirts.<br />I would recommend. We ordered red,purple,green,gold and navy. I would order one size bigger so that they can wear longer, but that is just me. They are true to fit, meaning what size you order and are wearing now, that is the size. Kids grow fast.
B00J3ATICE|5|I love my pirate goggle!
B004U4QKZ6|3|These shorts look really good straight out of the packet, yet after one wash there were alt least two loose threads and they looked a bit rough.<br />Impossible to iron properly will need to have them dry cleaned to bring them back up to spec.
B00QTKUJJC|5|These are loose in the leg but they work just as advertised
B00DVMFBJE|5|I love this comfy jacket. It was a perfect layer for me to take out on sails. Fits perfectly!
B00RGH04S8|4|only gave the product 4 stars because it's a little too large for me. I went by the sizing chart.  I would go under two sizes if I was ordering it again. I would just say the product itself is nice well made and I did have an option to return it but I just chose not to. I would buy it again 2/3 sizes  smaller than what I thought it would be from their sizes chart
B00PZKV1T4|5|Although the shirt was smaller than most mediums should be, CafePress went out of their way to send me an appropriate shirt size for the intended gift I was to send. Highly recommend purchasing through CafePress.
B00BMQTZ7K|5|AWESOME
B00BHLF07E|5|Wore for a Halloween party Good quality.
B00BVU88QG|5|Love this classy/stylish wallet great quality for a great price u wont regret:)
B00K1B1JA8|3|The top was a lot smaller than the bottoms and I think they will shrink. I would buy them a size larger than you need.
B00BXOBQO6|5|good deal....
B00FBL2BZ0|5|Really nice pattern and material. Washes great.
B000PYNW7Y|5|My mother-in-law has lost strength and dexterity.  We were beginning to lose hope of ever finding a bra she could fasten and wear comfortably.  Then we found this one.  A great product, need more like it
B0099LDB48|5|This outfit, as wellas, theother ones I got ftom Little Loved Ones are just amazing! They are of the highest quality and very darling for little girls.<br />I was also very pleased with the care in packaging. Each outfit I received was wrapped in tissue and then placed in a bag to ensure they were protected. Little Loved Ones :OVES the liitle ones for sure! I definitely recommend buying from them. You won't be disappointed!!
B00B8F73CY|3|Beautiful scarf but too small for the purpose I need it for. I purchased as a hair scarf for my natural hair. I had to return.
B001K2Q6ZK|5|Love the shirts, soft and comfy, but not too thin like many plain t-shirts nowadays.  Also won't shrink too much like other cheap t-shirts.
B00LYTBA78|5|Fits very well, snaps easily. I like the way it fits.
B00CH5TGTM|4|Warm and cozy
B008COIQR0|3|I went ahead and bought the \\"multi\\" because I was under the impression it might be different then the one described and pictured as \\"green\\". The costume arrived and it is the exact same one pictured in BOTH options. There is no way to contact the seller and I would have liked to email them and ask them what the difference was before wasting even $3 more than I needed to. As far as the costume goes, it looks just like the picture and it fit everywhere except the cuffs on the sleeves. I litterally had to cut them at the seam and luckily I found a similar colored fabric at Joann's which I plan to add an inch and a half of extension to each cuff. The pants that come with it are hideous so I went ahead and bought brown tights which I personally think looks much better. So: If you buy this costume, save yourself $3&change and buy the \\"green\\", and buy brown tights to go along with it.
B00BU4TOVG|4|When purchasing this dress I figured it would be good for a few upcoming occasions but I was surprised how much I liked this dress and have worn it more than expected. It fits nicely and is constantly earning me compliments. I'm not a &#34;dress girl&#34; but this is one I will wear.
B00BP4KBHW|5|SUPER cute cardigan. Unlike any other I have come across. Love the color, fit, and feel. Wish there more colors available. I would definitely purchase more.
B000UA2LHU|4|Nice & comfortable belt for the price you pay, great buy.
B000KGKFWW|1|This didn't last more than one use. Beautiful, rich color, everything good until they run and get destroyed in a second. (I put them on wearing gloves and still they ripped really fast)
B00BJOL48I|5|Best socks I've ever owned
B0019I2FDW|5|I purchased this band in black and white - it's perfect (trust me - I bought a few other brands, too - this one is superior). Stretchy and snug enough to keep my pants up and the open button concealed, but also soft and comfortable to wear.     I started using these around 16 weeks, and now at 30 weeks I'm still wearing pre-pregnancy pants - thanks to these bands!
B004DSCLC0|4|Ok
B000SKLTI4|3|My husband has always worn Wigwam over the calf socks. We thought we would try the Hanes because they are half the price. They stay up just fine. He misses the thicker weight of the Wigwam and says these just feel too &#34;thin&#34;. He also mentioned he did not care for the toe fit, but it might be fine for others. He's going to stick with these, but we will be going back to Wigwam with the next order.
B004WI9B7E|4|I think it's a great value for the money spent. Must admit that it could look cheap and on the lower scale of corduroys but the value and the looks for the money are there.
B00G5JITKS|3|When i bought these jeans i also bought a pair of Lucky 481 relaxed fit jeans. The difference in size is outrageous. Straight leg to relaxed fit shoudl not have this much difference. These jeans feel tight and almost fit like my 36X30 jeans. I bought 38X30 so i coulf have a little more room. The 481 relaxed fit are so loose that they would fall off without my belt on. Theses 221 straight legs are a little tight for my taste. Very weird since they should be 2 inches in the waiste larger.
B00453ER48|3|Definitely fits SNUG for being &#34;true to size&#34;... Cut short at the bottom as well. The buttons, tough to see in the photo, were many and tacky looking. Ended up giving this away to someone.
B00L2YXI9I|5|my son looking forward to wear this shirt
B00SGN0QW0|5|My granddaughter loves this dress,  I have it fitted for her.  But she loves it.
B00P6M2QPE|5|Received on time and fits as expected.
B00L9WZ652|2|Runs pretty small. The sleeves were really short :(
