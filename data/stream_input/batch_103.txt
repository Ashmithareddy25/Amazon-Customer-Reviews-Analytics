0671034065|3.0|Mr. Perfect was a great book for me--for about a third of the way through.  <br />I've never read a book of Ms. Howard's, with so much humor.  And I enjoyed the byplay between characters, especially Jaine and Sam.  How Jaine  and Sam meet, is for me, the most enjoyable part of the book.  But, romance  occurs swiftly (there's no romantic conflict) and the murder/mystery  occurs.  It's at that point in the book, where it falters, for me.<br />If you  find one of your best friend's been murdered--do you feel like making  love...as fear and possibly murder, surround you.    The sex scenes are  sexy, and well done.  But they occur too     soon, too frequently, given  the circumstances.<br />Sam's a typical Linda Howard hero...BIG, handsome,  alpha and sex-driven.  Jaine's gifted with a smart mouth, brains,   beauty...And, I did enjoy them as a couple.  The secondary characters are  interesting; (including the murderer) but there may have been too many of  them to give any individual attention.<br />The mystery will be a  surprise...and there is a feeling of doom (when the comedy or sex isn't  going on).  I guess, this is a very mixed review....
0792157850|5.0|Well, Temple Of Doom is not quite what RAIDERS was, but still a highly entertaining film.  What I can't stand most are the people who hate this film simply because of the fact that it is a sequel, or should I say  &quot;prequel&quot;, as the events in TEMPLE OF DOOM take place two years  prior to the events in RAIDERS.  The story is a little different this time  around; instead of battling nazis, Jones is battling a pegan colt after the  legendary shonkara stones, replacing (but not outdoing) the search for the  biblical ARK OF THE COVENANT.  The characters are a little more shallow in  this one, but far more convincing than anything by today's standerds (i.e.  TITANIC).  The villians are even a little scarier, especially  blood-curdling are the many SHEVA worshipers, who insist on using small  children as slaves to recover the lost stones.  The scene inwhich a man's  heart is literally ripped out from his chest was enough to inspire a PG-13  rating, which brings me to my next point.  Those of you out there who  insist that this film is too violent for children, I urge you to go to your  local cinema, and experience something far worse than what this picture has  to offer.  I hate to admit it, but I've seen some DISNEY films even more  violent than this film, and I'm actually kind of suprised at the  controversy this film developed.  All and all, TEMPLE OF DOOM hits it right  on all the elements.  The story is captivating, though less so than  RAIDERS, the acting is fine, film editing is impecable, production design  is extraordinary like RAIDERS, the visual effects were enough to garner an  academy award, the sound effects where once again phonomenal, and the music  score is actually much more deverse in my opinion, than the one featured in  RAIDERS.  What I like about this score is how the RAIDERS MARCH is utilized  so many times, and crammed in to so many situations...it adds much more  flare to the film, and is one of JOHN WILLIAM'S greatest musical  acheivements.  Now available in widescreen for the first time, the print is  impressivly clear, and is definatly well worth the purchase, at least until  the dvd release comes out.  This is actually one of the first films I  watched when we got our surround sound system.  It sounds superb in dolby,  for a vhs, and the action often passes from left to right, subwolfer, and  above.  Once again, another great action film from LUCAS and SPIELBERG,  followed by a rousing sequal.  Most memorable scenes would have to be the  opening night club scwabble over the antidote, the creature feature dinner,  the sacrificial heart removing sequence, Mine Cart Chase, and the grand  finale bridge crossing scene, very, very, impressive.  HIGHLY  RECCOMMENDED!
078062565X|5.0|&quot;King Kong&quot; has a magic all its own, untarnished by age or the development of better special effects.  Even today, there is a warmth and humanity to him missing from every last CGI monster around.  The movie  packs an emotional wallop that hasn't diminished either.  When Kong falls  to the ground, and Denham intones the immortal &quot;Twas Beauty killed the  beast,&quot; I still get choked up, even though I've seen the movie over  twenty times since I was a kid.  The acting is deliciously over the top,  Fay Wray is still the century's greatest screamer, and Kong is still the  saddest, most powerful ape ever put on film.  My daughter is three years  old; she recently watched this and the original &quot;Mighty Joe  Young&quot; with me, back-to-back.  She was mesmerized, and so was I.  A  classic for all time, no doubt.

630179513X|4.0|The Back to the Future trilogy is a great series, but I think part 3 is the weakest movie of the series. Of course, it has a lot of things incorporated from the other two, but it has some new things, too. Part 3  is, basically, a western because 80% of it is set in Hill Valley 1885.  Originally, Marty was just going to go home in the DeLorean (which is in a  hole underground and has been for 70 years,) but now he must save the Doc  of 1885, because he will die in 7 days. When he goes back there, he finds  out that Doc Brown has a GIRLFRIEND! But he also has crashed the DeLorean  and the fuel leaked so now he can't go back. But Doc of course finds a way-  the train will push the DeLorean until it gets to 88 mph. But first Marty  must save Doc from the western outlaw Biff (another Biff, called Buford,  who is hilarious again) and he must save himself. By the way, Marty calls  himself Clint Eastwod, and eventually they name the ravine after him. Will  Marty save himself and the Doc one more time? Will they get back to 1985?  How about Clara, Doc's Girlfriend? Find out in the conclusion of this great  series.

B00000J7J4|1.0|This album finds a once great guitarist trying to find an audience with the wrong people.  He wrongly aimed for the pop-trash, MTV, radio-play bulls**t.  I believe that he may still be a great guitarist and might be  able play excellent music, but this CD doesn't support that.  If you want  hardcore Santana: Santana 1, Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanserai, and Love  Devotion Surrender (with virtuoso John McClaughlin) are highly recommended.   But those who disagree with me can keep jerking-off to their Britney  Spears s**t and never know what great music is.
B000002HIK|3.0|I am a huge fan of RDJ album, Come to Daddy, and Windowlicker, but &quot;I Care..&quot; has really never struck my fancy.  Just lately I've begun listening to it a little more, and it's starting to become listenable  again.  It contains none of the drum and bass elements of his later stuff,  and is more along the lines of intelligent dance music, at least i think it  is.  If older aphex, autechre, u-ziq float your boat, than this is probably  a good bet.  But if you love his later works, it's probably just better to  avoid this.
B00003CX59|4.0|As with all of Burton's films this one is visually stunning, dark, cartoony and with gothic atmosphere. Burton has certainly proved himself of being an original filmmaker and his films carry his stamp. And with all his  visual flair, 'Sleepy Hollow' is one of his best looking films, beautiful  costumes and sets are brilliantly captured by truly impressive  cinematography. But as a film, it is a lot of fun; spooky, funny and  exciting. Johnny Depp, who has collaborated with Burton in many successful  films, is excellently cast as the bumbling Ichabod, he is funny, heroic and  makes for a very likable hero. Christina Ricci is also great as Ichabod's  love interest, a great characterization and a slight change of pace from  all the heavy stuff she did on 'The Opposite of Sex' and in 'Buffalo 66'.  In fact the casting was impressive all around, but casting Christopher  Walken as the headless horseman, that was inspired casting. It's hard to  think of anybody else in the role, even if he is only in a few scenes he  sure leaves an impact as always. Excellent foggy atmosphere and a truly  brilliant score also help. The numerous frightening attacks by the headless  horseman are highlights, besides being technical marvels, they are exciting  and scary. The only flaw with this film is the ending, Burton made a  violent turn from being a fun-house romp to a serious mystery. And the last  fight with Ichabod and the headless horseman is a little too action-heavy.  That brought down the film a little but not too much, it still remains  entertaining and fun. Extras: Martin Landau, who won an Oscar working with  Burton in 'Ed Wood', has a cameo at the beginning of the film. From a scale  of 1-10 I give this film a 7!
038533348X|5.0|this book is more than a gretawork of literature. this book has a heart and soul. beyond description.
6305718903|3.0|'Stigmata' shouldn't be billed as a 'thriller' and much less as a 'horror' film. It is more like a modern melodrama with a heavy dose of religious subject matter, nice performances and some nice editing but unfortunately  not much more. The subject matter is sure to stir up some controversy but  that could easily be done be reading the basic ideas in a book, a film is  made to entertain and deliver something whether it's tears, laughs or  scares. While not a very bad film, 'Stigmata' just doesn't score in any  cinematic genre, it tries to swing violently between them but never scores.  Patricia Arquette, as always, fails to make an impression but gets the job  done well enough. Gabriel Byrne gives the best performance in the cast and  decided to play it mellow, which is a good thing and we never get weary of  his character. The main problem here is that explores subjects it couldn't  possibly tackle. Basically, it stirs up some intriguing and controversial  ideas but leaves you wanting. And also the filmmakers added some blood and  violence near the end so the audience would get their moneys worth but  ended up bringing the film down. It also has a heavy dose of 'The Exorcist'  on the 'scary scenes'. And also the ending is dull and unsatisfying. It  ultimately feels like a half-baked idea made into a movie. From a scale of  1-10 I give this film a 5!
630349255X|5.0|OHmiGAWD flawless. This is a MUST have. My roomate and his boyfriend and I are all watching this just transfixed. Anybody remember Koyanisquazi or however you spell? A similar kind of visual onslaught.<br />This film is very  powerful......<br />GET IT
0671578855|5.0|Being a long time reader of Ms. Bujolds work I was very excited when the book came out..not having expected another for some time.  So I was somewhat disappointed with the slow start of the novel.  But confident that  Ms. Bujold would continue in her habit of writing excellent books with a  lavish touch of humor and a wry sensible wisdom I bent my eyes to the page  and continued...<br />What a MISTAKE! Shortly afterwards..perhaps 1/4 to 1/3  of the way into the novel it did the usual trick that Miles Vorkosigan  books perform...it grabbed hold and wouldnt let go for love, money, or lack  of sleep. Needless to say...I finished it in one night.<br />The book picks up  perhaps 3-6 months after the last book left off..at this point while the  novel *might* be understandble from a stand-alone point I wouldnt count on  it..go back and read the others..starting from Shards of Honor...or if  you're pressed for time from Warriors Apprentice...trust me..you wont be  sorry you did. Whee! Run-on sentences are so much fun!  At any rate Miles  is preparing for two distinctly different campaigns..the wooing of Ekaterin  Vorsoisson, a young widow introduced in the previous book, Komarr, and  plotting his assault on the bastions of power..namely inserting himself  into the political process of Barrayar.  Taking on either of these tasks  might be considered foolhardy for your average human being..and taking them  both together sheer hubris..but if there is one thing Miles posesses it is  hubris.<br />The book then wends its way through the slow build-up..starting  to pick up speed as Miles attemps to woo Ekaterin..without telling her  about it.  This tactic brings about a crashing defeat..ushering in the  second half of the book. At this point the action begins to pick up..Mile's  courtship of a widow whose husband's death he was involved in having  attracted the notice of those he is politicking against.  This..combined  with two very touchy subjects for the upcoming Council of Counts brings  matters to a head.  Ivan..Mile's cousin..always before portrayed as a less  than stellar officer in the Emperor's service is fleshed out a bit more in  this book...giving you a closer look at Ivan's inner self..with some  surprising results.  Mile's clone-brother also returns and adds some of the  necessary levity the yarn..lightening the mood and adding another thread to  the plot.<br />Readers who have read the entire series including Shards of  Honor and Barrayar will be particularly amused by one scene involving Mark  and his intended..Kareen Koudelka. All in all A Civil Campaign was an  excellent book with the sole complaint that it was a little bit slow in  starting..but the ending is emminently satisfying for those who have been  following Miles throughout the series.  As usual a must read by Ms. Bujold.
B00000K44W|5.0|I lost my vinyl version of this one a long time ago -- glad to see I can replace it on CD. This is one of Tull's most underrated releases; it followed the all-but-unfollowable _Songs From The Wood_ and just never had  the impact its predecessor had.<br /><br />Too bad. There's great stuff on  here.<br /><br />The title track is some of the band's best musicianship ever --  John Glascock's bass actually _sounds_ like the clomp of horses' hooves and  the thunder of the gathering storm. (By the way, this album was Glascock's  last recording with the band before his untimely death. He's always been my  favorite among their bassists.)<br /><br />There's also &quot;One Brown  Mouse,&quot; an old favorite of mine -- Ian Anderson sounds great, growling  along and harmonizing with himself in fifths.<br /><br />And there's  &quot;Weathercock&quot; -- featuring Anderson's soaring flutes over a  thumping backbeat in what may be _the_ quintessential Jethro Tull  instrumental break.<br /><br />I could go on, but enough from me. I'm going to  order this CD as soon as possible, and any Tull fans who don't already have  it should probably do likewise. This is some of their best work.
B000002KBU|5.0|This was my fortunate introduction the music of Joni Mitchell, and this stripped down, initmate set of songs still gets regular play in my tape deck. The rhythmic acoustic strumming, and 'barely there' percussion that  introduces &quot;All I Want&quot; is a distinctive, inviting intro to the  LP and sets the tone for what will be a very personal emotional journey.  Throughout this sterling song cycle, Joni lays her soul bare in such  beautiful, loving tunes as &quot;My Old Man&quot;, &quot;Carey&quot;  &quot;A Case Of You&quot; and my personal favorites: the gorgeous title  song, &quot;A Little Green&quot; and &quot;The Last Time I Saw  Richard&quot; , songs so rich in detail they seem to place the listener  right in midst of what's going on. The sound and overall tone of the album  is understated and serene. With only the sparest of backing ( acoustic  guitar, mandolin or piano ) Ms. Mitchell's pristine, shivery soprano is  right out front where it should be, forcing you to hear and feel every  word. This is the album that made the world sit up and really pay attention  to 'singer/songwriters' for the first time. &quot;Blue&quot; remains a  highwater mark in pop music.  A welcome addition to your collection.
B00004U2G4|5.0|There must be a law forcing everybody in this world to have this TERRIBLE ALBUM in their collections!  Its like The Bible, so simply, so strong, so fine, so bizarre. Check out the staff: Jeff &quot;Im in fire&quot; Beck,  Rod &quot;I drink a bottle of scotch before&quot; Stewart, Ron &quot;I like  to dance over my bass&quot; Wood, Mick &quot;I shot your heart&quot;  Waller, and Nicky &quot;I played with everybody&quot; Hopkins. This is  really a Dream Team, and think about the year it was recorded and still  sounds great. All young guys. All great musicians. And together they made  one of the bests album recorded ever! Since I bought it in 1990 I simply  cant stop hearing it. You must do the same. Trust me.
630280082X|5.0|the combination of old school blues lore and modern storytelling helps  bridge a gap in music that has often been to large to cross. it's a story  about the roots of music and the will of man to aquire the spirit of music  and the ability to play it right.
B0000025IE|5.0|After Stained class and Hell Bent for leather... It came this beautiful Masterpiece from the most powerful Metal band ever... This is the following of a group of great albums... Although it is the most comercial album, it  doesn't mean is so bad. &quot;Breaking the law&quot; and &quot;living after  midnight&quot; are songs than anyone of the Metal-fans would recognize...  &quot;Rapid fire&quot; is a speed song that grabs the attention of  anyone... Grinder is the almighty song, I think the most underrated song  here is &quot;The Rage&quot; Good enough to be one of the best  &quot;United&quot; and &quot;Steeler &quot; are songs that makes this album  complete. &quot;DOn't have to be old to be wise&quot; is the only weird  song here both I like it anyway.<br />So... If you're looking to be a Judas  Priest fan... Let this be your first... You'll know what everyone know...  and let Defenders of the faith be the second... You'll find yourself being  caught by Judas all mighty strenght... METAL GODS IS THE BEST SON OF THE  ALBUM!
B000003NA4|4.0|This is Diana Krall's tribute to love.  She is at her most intimate here, as a lover expressing herself through a full range of emotions, with some of the most romantic music ever written.   At times, playful and coy, at  other times, sad and lonely, her interpretations of these classic songs are  always brilliant, leaving the listener wanting more.  Her ability and  confidence, for example, to take a standard like Gershwin's, &quot;They  Can't Take That Way From Me&quot; and bring out nuances missing from even  Astaire's version puts her in the first tier of song stylists.  This is  music for the loved and the lovelorn.  We all have our personal &quot;Love  Scenes&quot;.  These songs speak for to anyone willing to listen.  And to  love.
B0000025RQ|5.0|As a great fan of Judas Priest, I have to consider this a great album. With classics like &quot;Electric eye&quot; and &quot;YOu've got another thing coming&quot; this album express itself like one of the best on the  Judas's story.<br />I have a little inclination about &quot;Take these  Chains&quot;, &quot;Fever&quot;, Riding on the wind&quot; and Screaming for  vengeance&quot;. The best songs in the album...<br />I want to say that, even  if they aren't as heavy as in British Steel or Defenders of the Faith,  Judas themselves show a lot of talent on this one.<br />Grab it, listen it and  then... You will be catch by the same feeling I got when I listen to  this.<br />&quot;You've got another thing coming&quot;
B00003CX59|5.0|I saw, this it was good and alittle scary it's not based, on a true story.....but I liked, this movie good.....
B0000025CP|4.0|Maybe I'll get killed as I say that I'm a great fan of Judas Priest and I give this 4 stars. Let me explain.<br />If this CD had been my first one, it would've gotten 5 stars, but OK let's get this review.<br />It's a great album  to begin as JP fan, it has good sound and lyrics, and I ove songs like  &quot;Exciter&quot; &quot;Saints in hell&quot; and &quot;Beyond the realms  of death&quot;... and if you're looking for heavy tune... forget it! The  rhytm is great but not as heavy as Painkiller... This is a masterpiece of  the Metla gods, and I think thye have done it well. Their beginnings were  totally amazing... as this CD<br />Buy it and learn how to be the best...  whitout the needs of Heavy sounds (Doesn't mean it has to be bad)<br />Enjoy
B00003CX59|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is an excellent movie.  Johnny Depp is wonderful and charming with his light touches for comic relief - constant fainting and feeling sick to his stomach.  He is perfect as Crane.  All the actors did  great, especially Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman.  You'll get  a kick out of him, great make-up.  <br />This movie has to be one of Tim  Burton's best. Nothing like Mars Attacks, which was pretty bad.  This is a  very sophisticated movie, with a perfect amount of suspension, action,  romance, and humor.  And the plot takes a nice twist and the mystery behind  the Headless Horseman is surprising.<br />I definitely recommend this movie.   It's really entertaining and it appeals to all types.  Give this movie a  try, you'll like it.
0671047272|5.0|I loved listening to this book.  The author did an excellent job, and the story keep my interest from beginning to end.  I hated to see it end.
0452279178|4.0|When I started reading the Dark Tower series, I was really into it. It was awesome. Number I,II,III. Amazing. Then I get to Wizard and Glass. I was so into the story that was going on, I didn't care what the main character's  past was. The flashbook is at least 8/10's of the book. It took me awhile  to get past the begining of the flashback, then it just comes out  INCREDIBLE. The book is great. I just think the flashback is a little too  long. Good Job King!
B00000099Y|5.0|When Tool released their second disc, Undertow, in 1994 they broke through into a more mainstream crowd (thanks in part to the sucess of &quot;Sober&quot; with the eerie video for it).  Now Tool has shown their  growth in Aenema which gets even freakier and wierder than Undertown.  &quot;Stinkfist&quot; is a song although censored by MTV is really about a  relationship.  &quot;Eulogy&quot; shows a new side of Tool and features  Maynard talking about the exisistance of Christ and he writes his lyrics in  such a way that it's hard to even tell if he is for or against the man.   &quot;H&quot; is I think about abuse and features an awesome rythem section  backed by Adam Clayton's great rythem guitar parts.  Sonically, &quot;Forty  Six &amp; Two&quot; and &quot;Hooker..&quot; are great with the  intstruments and vocals coming in at perfect times.  &quot;Aenema&quot; was  all over the radio here in NYC a couple years ago and is still played a few  times still today.  The most bizarre and best track is the last one  &quot;Third Eye&quot; which starts out slow but then goes into some of the  most amazing vocals I have ever heard.  Even if you aren't a fan of heavy  music, this CD will please you because it shows that this band sees music  as a true art form, not just a commercial thing, and these four fine  muscicians are right on tact on this CD.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Short and sweet: the transfer for this DVD is gorgeous. You know how good the film is, now see how beautiful it can look. The bountiful supplemental material will further enhance your appreciation of this classic. My only  complaint, and a greedy one, I'll admit: the &quot;outtakes&quot; are too  brief. Where's all the footage of the shark going wrong? This is a must-own  DVD.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's quite difficult to write a review for one of the greatest albums of all time, but from the disillusioned reviewers out there that claim this album is \\"not that good\\" or \\"a waste of money,\\" I felt obligated to point  out just how wrong they are.<br />First of all, this album is a CONCEPT album  so you cannot say, \\"Take away the art work and funky packaging and all you  have is some music.\\"  This is a piece of artwork, so the album liner,  cover, and artwork are all part of a presentation.  I might add for you  Beach Boy fans that the Sgt. Pepper artwork is a hell of a lot more  interesting than the bunch of farm animals hanging around on \\"Pet Sounds,\\"  but hey...some guys swing that way.<br />Second, this album is not for the  song-selecting few out there who are trying to get a couple of radio hits  for their collection.  This album was meant to be listened to from start to  finish, or more precisely, from \\"here to there.\\"  The ALBUM is meant to  move you, not a particular song or song(s), so don't start griping when you  have to skip to \\"track 3\\" every time you pop in the album.  Stick to your  greatest hits collection for the radio play, buy this album to experience  it.<br />Third, you've GOT to wonder why this album is still causing a ruckus  30 years after it was released.  Ask any kid today who the Beach Boys are  and they will respond, \\"don't you mean Beastie Boys...?\\"  Compare that to the  fact that the shelf life of today's bands is about 2 weeks and you'll  realize it's quite a feat.  Yet 3 decades later this album is still as  timeless as the day it came out, and still as applicable to today's society  as it was to the 60's generation of hippies.<br />Finally, I expect to get  some flaming emails from those of you who happen to hate The Beatles, like  the Beach Boys, or just like farm animals.  But if you're just mailing me  to gripe about how much you hate \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" don't bother.  That's why  used CD shops exist....
B000002NBY|5.0|I was 11 when this album came out, and my mom was always a huge fan of Paul Simon, so I grew up listening to him, but I'll never forget the first time I heard Graceland, we were on a road trip across America and this  album so exemplified what true American music meant. This is truly a  magnificent album, a classic which should be in everyone's collection. This  album is flawless and flows beautifully from song to song. Sheer  perfection!
B000002U9K|5.0|The entire album is full of lyrical and lush sophistication. Defined New York City and London in the 80's. Who can forget &quot;Opportunities&quot;? The quintessential Reagan era anthem for a young, motivated urban based  generation. This CD ooozes big city oppulence, fashion and bittersweet  alienation. &quot;Two Divided by Zero&quot; sets the stage. One can imagine  hearing it while riding a cab in from JFK, excited about what new  adventures await in the city. &quot;West End Girls&quot; is the greatest  dance tune ever written. This worldwide hit still has a mesmerizing power  over people. Can you name anyone, electronic fan or not, that didn't like  this song? Listen to the lyrics on these songs. They're still relevant  today. This CD is like a soundtrack for the fast pace lifestyle of the  worldwide urban set. A classic, truly dead on. Established the Boys as the  genius' they are. Tennant's lyrics are truly something to behold and Lowe  knows how to put together the best eurodance pop. They've defined the  scene.
1891252089|5.0|I have taken one of David's Ashtanga workshops and left awestruck -- he so wonderfully explains not just the &quot;how&quot; of doing each asana, but the &quot;why&quot; and the spirit of practice linking them. So, I had high  expectations for his book, and it did not disappoint. The explanations and  illustrations are clear and comprehensive, and it perfectly captures his  charismatic, down-to-earth, very approachable teaching style. I consider it  my textbook reference for the Ashtanga series of Sri Patabhi Jois. It's the  next best thing to actually attending one of David Swenson's workshops.

B000006TRV|5.0|Roger Waters proves the world his lyrical genius through this album. Other rock stars write songs: Waters puts years and years of mental anguish into two CD's of the most solid music ever created. The soaring sonic and lyric  picture created by the magic combination Roger Waters haunting vocals,  David Gilmours amazingly influential guitar work, Nick Mason's steadfast  bass contribution and Richard Wright's percussive backup has made this  album and instant classic. However, in the midst of Waters' amazing lyrics,  the musicality of this album must not be forgotten. David Gilmour plays  some of the most amazing solos ever recorded in &quot;Comfortably  Numb&quot;, and the sonic picutre created in &quot;In the Flesh&quot;  leaves a chill and a vivid mental picture in one's head for quite a while.  All in all, this record is a must have for anyone who appreciates music in  any context.
0783229887|3.0|This &quot;chuckie&quot; movie was by far the funniest. Wasn't as scary as the first 3 but it was good. I'm a fan of scary movies, and I know a scary movie when I see one but this was not one of them. So If you want to laugh  alot and maybe get one scare this is the movie!
B00000K19E|1.0|Heavy handed new age metaphor drowned in a blinding overkill of special FX. Really clunky script, too. Stereotype characters from casting central,  horrible cliches trying to pass as archetypal figures: Joseph Campbell's  &quot;The Hero With a Thousand Faces&quot; as visually interpreted by a  fifteen year old boy with a &quot;QUAKE&quot; fetish. Totally masturbatory  shoot out sequences too, hard to believe that this film hasn't been  skewered by the public in light of all those school shootings.

0425173755|4.0|This is a very good book. Very interesting. Ingenious soulution. A bit boring at times but still very good.
6304143184|5.0|THERE ARE NO OTHER WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS INCREDIBLE FILM OTHER THAN IT HAS TO BE THE GREATEST FANTASY EVER FILMED.  IT HAS A STORY WHICH IS TIMELESS AND WITH FABULOUS DIRECTION, ACTING &amp; ALL PRODUCTION ASPECTS  INCLUDING JOHN WILLIAMS BEST MUSICAL SCORE. I AM A GREAT FILM BUFF, YET NO  FILM HAS EVER MADE ME FEEL SO MUCH EMOTION AS E.T. ALSO I'VE ALWAYS FELT IT  WAS A GREAT SHAME FOR E.T. NOT TO HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST  PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR BACK IN 1982. IT WAS 100X BETTER THAN gandhi (did  I spell that correctly? Ah, who cares) I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE RERELEASE IN  2002 AND ALSO CAN'T WAIT UNTIL IT COMES OUT ON DVD.  I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND  WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN FOREVER.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE, YOU  HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE MISSING. I KNOW THAT THE CHILDREN OF TOMORROW  WILL ALSO FEEL THE SAME WAY. A GREAT FILM!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Wow! This cd has lots of cool dance songs. It also has Britney  talking in between each song. I especially enjoy her second single &quot;Lucky&quot;. It's a classic pop song. She has matured a lot since her first album. Her  music is less teeny boppery than the previous ones. Come on...you know you  like listening to her songs, too! It's worth it.
6301404440|5.0|After buying the video, and watching it three times in two days, I still want to see it again.  I remember taking my sister to see it the day after I saw it for the first time at the theater.  This is a roll-down-the-aisles  funny movie.<br />    Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is called in to spy on Roger  Rabbit's (voiced hilariously by Charles Fleischer) wife Jessica (voiced by  Kathleen Turner).  The pictures he takes of Jessica are assumed by most to  be the cause of Roger murdering Marvin Acme.  But there's one catch.  Roger  didn't do it.          Judge Doom (Christopher LLoyd), the menacing villain  and residing judge of Toontown is hot on his trail.  Through it all, we see  an enjoyable send-up of private eye movies, and a cast of thousands of  stock cartoon characters from the 30's, 40's and 50's.  <br />    Don't miss  the sizzling singing number when we first meet Jessica Rabbit.   &quot;That's Jessica Rabbit! &quot;  The singing, by the way, is not  Kathleen Turner, but Amy Irving.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido has a beautiful voice, which reflects the mysterious, majestic music. The guitar strings and percussion blends perfectly well with Dido's vocals. I've heard her song &quot;Here With Me&quot; used as a theme song in the  awesome show &quot;Roswell&quot;. I also heard her song &quot;Honestly  OK&quot; appear in &quot;Popular&quot;, and her song &quot;Thank You&quot;  appear on &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;. If you like Jewel, Sarah Mchlachlan,  or Alanis Morissette, get this spiritual, relaxing cd now.
B000003TB6|4.0|This is a fantastic album. It balances the elements of Jazz and Hip-Hop with a great proficiency, and the use of instruments is almost innotive. The emcees can flow too, and... Well, just buy it!
B000001Y79|5.0|Not knowing anyone who doesn't own this, or love this, is not surprising. Tragic Kingdom is what brought No Doubt up the charts, with the classic ska ballad Don't Speak. A lot happend to the band during this album including the band's jealousy of Gwen being the only one noticed. As you listen, you can actually hear the true closeness this band has. This album in particular heads toward a rock-edge, with enough trumpets to explode the sound system. What makes Tragic Kingdom noteworthy is the bands adorable, yet rock-hard tune, and the incredible, fun-loving band itself.
B000008H1Y|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best of Tull. I can't pick any one song as my favorite, they all are great. The innuendos found throughout the album are extremely entertaining. The strength of the songs is amazing, the  entire album rocks.<br />I don't think I know of 2 Tull albums that really  sound the same so you can't compare this to Aqualung or J-Tull.com, it  stands on its own.<br />I love this one!
B000007SPT|4.0|i get quite disapponited after my great expectation of the latter projects of This Mortal Coil coz they can't never reach the prime time in [It'll end in tears],which's so beautiful like a work from otherworld,maybe the main  reson is that the best song in the album is featuring Liz from CT. but  Kangaroo is also gorgeous.
B00000GAIW|4.0|&quot;Snot is running down his nose...&quot; Who can forget Aqualung? Everything about the song is memorable, as are &quot;Locomotive Breath&quot; and &quot;Cross Eyed Mary&quot;. There are songs on this disk  that are almost as good as those 3 that never get the airtime they deserve.  &quot;Aqualung&quot; seems to be the disk that gets most people hooked on  Tull. It has a pretty good range of song types- from the hard-hitting  &quot;Aqualung&quot; to the introspective &quot;Wond'ring Aloud&quot; Ian  and the boys really show their talents on this one.<br />Concept album,  organized religions role in society, blah blah. If you're in to digging out  the meaning of songs, this album will give you plenty to work with. If you  just dig really GOOD music, this album will give you plenty to work with.
B0000042H4|2.0|Whatever people say, I can't help feeling that Culshaw wanted to &quot;conduct&quot; these recordings from the control room. All his tricks, editing and balances are very tiring, the truth is that the Ring doesn't  sound like this at all in the theatre. This recording made Solti a famous  conductor, but why DECCA chose a little known conductor from Munich in the  first place? There were LOTS of great conductors active at the time&gt;  Klemperer, Knappterbusch, Szell, De Sabata, Monteux, Kubelik, Kempe, etc. I  second those who prefer Bohm's cycle, it is quite simply a more honest  performance, and it shares some of Solti's best singers.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I don't have the words to describe this disk. It was kind of strange the first couple times I listened to it, but it kept getting better and better. 10 years later I can still listen to it for days on end, if only my Ricky  Martin loving wife would give it back to me...
B00000K501|5.0|I first saw this video in my friend's dorm room after yet another exciting game of Snowboard kids and fell in love.<br /> Pyrotechnics, Drums and Guitars!  What more could one ask for? Listing to the CD is fine but  nothing is quite like experiencing Rammstein except for actually attending  a concert. This is a must for anyone who likes Industrial/Heavy Metal/Goth  music.
B0000029DD|5.0|I don't throw that title around lightly.  Unlike the many people who label albums as such after hearing the album twice and noticing that it's &quot;really catchy&quot;, I have put a year of thought into this judgment.   Nor am a narrow-minded rock classicist who refuses to acknowledge that any  music made after 1975 could compare to the few &quot;masters of rock 'n  roll&quot; (and we all know who they are).   Jeff Buckley had the voice of  an angel, but that angel knew how to rock.  Whether he was singing about  the trials of love (Lover, You Should Have Come Over) or existential dread  (Grace) he infused every song with firey honesty.  VERY rarely does an  artist have such an intimate relationship with music; an almost symbiotic  relationship, where he controls it completely and yet he becomes  emotionally possessed BY it.  The highlights of this album are difficult to  name, because every track shows a different side of this musical genius,  but the songs that affect me the most are &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;,  &quot;Grace&quot;, and &quot;So Real&quot;.  I won't delve into the  particulars of the songs and arrangements, but if you don't already own  this phenomenal album, you are truly missing out.
B00002Z88D|5.0|This was my first Metallica album... Actually I bought this album first for a friend who was a Metallica fan (and this was the only one he didn't have). Then I bought a copy for myself.<br /> I love the sound of this album  as I've told my friends before There is something about the sound of  violins and guitars. My favorite songs on thios album are &quot;Sad But  True&quot; &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot; &quot;Of Wolf And  Man&quot; and &quot;Hero Of The Day&quot;
B000002UAU|3.0|Okay. People really need to stop and think about the very important distinction that one must make between 3 key terms: &quot;innovative&quot;, &quot;influential&quot;, and &quot;excellent&quot;. Because they mean very  different things. Were the Beatles innovative? Absolutely. It is the  general consensus of pretty much everyone that they changed the face of  popular music. Were they influential? Of course! Everyone from Bruce  Springsteen to Suzanne Vega was influenced by the Beatles, and it does show  in many subsequent artists' creative output. Now, were they  &quot;excellent&quot;? That's a tough question, because people have been  touting them as a rock superlative for so long that we've stopped really  *listening* to the music. I sat down and really LISTENED to Sgt. Pepper,  with a critical and analytical ear, and I must say that the Beatles [in  comparison with much of the music made SINCE they disbanded] were simply  alright. Now before you rush to click the &quot;this review was not  helpful&quot; button, hear me out. I acknowledge both their influence and  their innovation, but the reason I appreciate it so much is that it paved  the way for other artists to pick up WHERE THEY LEFT OFF. Did the Beatles  experiment with different sound textures? Yes, but later work done with  more sophisticated sound equipment was both more complex and more sonically  rewarding (i.e. Nine Inch Nails, Kate Bush). Were their lyrics  philosophical/interesting/original? Well, to a certain extent they did  advance beyond their early lyrical simplicity, but they NEVER wrote a line  as poetic as Joni Mitchell, as mystical as Peter Gabriel, or as expressive  as Ani DiFranco. Now down the basics: musicianship. Were they good  instrumentalists? Hmm...they could play just fine, but there weren't any  Keith Moons, Eric Claptons, Jaco Pastorius', or Van Halens lurking behind  those English suits. Could they sing? Sure, Paul McCartney had a nice voice  and John Lennon could carry a tune(although it was rather rough at times)  but they couldn't hold a candle to the likes of Jeff Buckley and Michael  Jackson, who would come along many years later. In short, the Beatles were  a decent group of musicians who wrote many catchy, occasionally innovative  tunes and DID in fact change popular music forever. But they merely set the  stage for GREATER things, and people must acknowledge that Sgt. Pepper,  despite being a unique recording *at the time*, is simply not that special  in comparison with things that have come along since. Now, you will  probably dismiss this review as the rantings of someone who doesn't know  what they're talking about, but do me (and yourself) a favor, and really  stop to think. Forget about your nostalgia and the musical dogma that  surrounds that matter, and be brave enough to suggest that the Beatles are  the the end-all of popular music. &quot;The Most Influential Album of the  20th Century&quot;?  Quite possibly.  &quot;The Greatest Album of the 20th  Century&quot;? Don't be absurd.
B00004W5UA|4.0|Who do you identify with more - Jack, the insomniac office drone who hates his job, but can't escape, who loves IKEA furniture but hates himself for it, or the mysterious Tyler Durden, by day a soap salesman, but by night  someone much more subversive? This movie was billed as being about  fighting, but its really about the human soul and the box of  conventionality in which we keep it locked. Here's what Tyler Durden has to  say: 'We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We  have no great war, or great depression.  The great war is a spiritual war.   The great depression is our lives.' For Durden, consumerism and the  American dream is the enemy. The film asks whether there might not be a  crazy free spirit, an urban terrorist, an unabomber, in each of us, and if  there is, what we are going to do about it. If cancer sufferers can have  their own self-help groups, what about modern-life sufferers? What will  allow us to actually feel the pain of modern existence?

0783240287|5.0|The entire production is fantastic.  My children and I watched it repeatedly and I find myself humming, singing, and whistling the tunes throughout the day.  The songs are fabulous, the sets are great, and the  story is timeless.  I would recommend it without reservation to any family.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie just blew my mind.  It is my all time favorite movie with a  great storyline, and awesome action scenes what more could you possibly  want.  Unlike many other movies I have seen this movie really makes you  think. And it was even better when I saw it at my friend's house on DVD!   This is the kind of movie I could see over and over again... I've already  seen it 8 times!  If you haven't seen the Matrix... you should, this is a  movie you won't want to miss!
006016848X|5.0|Since I do not know what happened to my last review, I will attempt once again...this book is not for everyone. It is for the average person. That means you may fall outside the &quot;norm&quot; and not be the typical male  or female. <br />But if we talk about averages, men (typically) are the hunter  gathers, that is why we (women) dont understand when men don't feel like  talking. (Hey you dont gab when trying to take down a wildebeast! )And  women are the chatty ones, what else would you do sitting at the bank of  the river, washing out loin cloths or stirring wildebeast bones in a pot  over a fire? This book goes right back to those good old days,(using  today's work or home life as the example).... when that was essentially  what the average male and female did on a daily basis.  If you feel you or  your loved one doesnt fall in that range, no problem....but that is the  average norm!  And as we all know, some of us do not fall in the norm all  of the time..But hey, its a fun read and it will disturb you on how  accurate it discribes &quot;most&quot; men and women and the relationships  they have. I say disturb, because that is what this book tends to do, it  really is eye opening.
B00004THAY|5.0|Every once and a while you can find a CD that really stands out from the rest.  The combination of two great guitarist on one CD makes this one a stand-out.  By the end of the first time you listen you realize this is  your new favorite CD.  The sound of both musicains is distinctive, and  listening to the relaxed style of play it is hard to imagine they captured  this in a studio,and not on a front porch, backstage, or convertable.  The  playing is clean, the mix is right, this is a great CD.
B0000203YT|3.0|Movie was done well, the acting was wonderful, but the story was not what I would have paid to see.<br />Number one rule for me with movies is: I can be honest on the writing and acting, in this case, both were at least 3 stars,  but in this case, I didnt like the characters. Shakespeare plays an  adulterer, who is estranged from his wife and children, who falls for the  lead female character. I am not fond of characters who have those low moral  standards.<br /> My husband took me to this movie, because he had heard it was  a good date flick, well, not really, unless you find men who are cheating  on thier wives romantic and attractive. So that did not make him a highly  desirable male character for me to enjoy the story.<br />Much as I did not  enjoy the English Patient, I feel I must at least enjoy the character or at  least like them, in order to enjoy the movie or story. Otherwise it ends up  being a non moving event.
6305807086|3.0|Didn't everyone get so excited when this was released at the movies? - what a unique film, so different from all the other guff out there, one that makes you think and sends its director's profile into the  stratosphere.<br />It's probably worthwhile now to give it a second look and  see if it does stand up - wait for it - it's not bad but hardly the classic  it has been made out to be. Warning - Spike Jonze is not the saviour of  American cinema on the evidence of this film. I know this won't endear me  to those people who love the film and have been waiting for this second  coming (those same people who lauded a certain Mr Tarantino until he came  out with his segment of &quot;Four Rooms&quot;) but while it does have some  nice touches it does have many drawbacks.<br />So let's get the bad stuff out  of the way - it's way too long and the sub-plot with the wrinklies doesn't  work - a bid to add some excitement to the film. I'm sorry but Cameron Diaz  in that fright wig doesn't work either. I am a huge fan of Ms Diaz's work  but this isn't her best. The streak of misogny doesn't help the film  either, and this isn't just being politically correct. While Ms Diaz does  deserve to be told off for that wig, locking her in a cage goes way  overboard. Finally John Cusack just really gets on your nerves - I just  wanted to give him a slap.<br />Now for the good - and despite what I have  said there is still some - John Malkovitch for example. He sends himself up  superbly and anyone that has an image of him as a surly actor will surely  have their opinion changed. The scene where he enters his own head is  inspired and this gives me hope that Mr Jonze does have a future.  Malkovitch surely deserved a nod at the Oscars but the Academy probably got  confused - nominate a man for playing himself, for goodness sake? However  Catherine Keener did get a nomination and I just hope more of the  movie-going public discover this wonderful actress.<br />So there you have it  - a film that has been hyped to the gills, does contain a few excellent  touches in what one hopes is a successful career for Mr Jonze. But the  greatest film of the last year.....I think not!m that has been hyped to the gills, does contain a few excellent  touches in what one hopes is a successful career for Mr Jonze. But the  greatest film of the last year.....I think not!
B000002LCI|5.0|I bought this album in 1987 and was utterly amazed by it. Each time I listened to it, I felt like I was being taken on a dark journey of images and places I've never known or seen before. I still remember how much I  anticipted DM's next album &quot;Violator&quot; and felt slighty  dissapointed with every other DM album thereafter because although they had  some great songs, they never provided the journey that this album does. The  only other album that comes close is Black Celebration. I have every single  DM album and single on this planet but I'd have to say that this is the  only one I pull up from time to time -- and love every second of the  journey it takes me on.

I reluctantly read it, not realizing  how much it would change my marriage!  We were both surprised by the  results!  My husband and I have since decided this would become a standard  wedding gift in hopes that others we know may have the same opportunity to  improve their marriage as we had.  This is a fantastic book!

B00003BE32|3.0|S&amp;M is obviously one of Metallica's best efforts.  The band and the  orchestra make a great collaboration; it's a must-get for any Metallica  fan.  One small piece of advice: get the CD, not the video, unless you  really want it.  I mean, the video is a bit useful; it gives you a taste of  the intensity of a Metallica show, and is cool the first few times you  watch it, but overall you'll be a lot happier with the CD, which never gets  old (duh, it's a Metallica album).  The video does get old pretty quickly,  for 3 reasons (all of which pretty obvious):<br />1. Not-so-great sound  quality.  Can't hear the bass.  CD is a lot crisper.<br />2. The CD you can  travel with (i.e. take it to school and stuff like that).  The video, of  course, is restricted to home use.  And if you're like me and are the only  person in the family who doesn't mind Metallica you may have to resort to  just watching it when you're the only person in the house (unless you have  a VCR in a seperate private room, but that still doesn't seem to stop  complaints).<br />3. The CD lets you skip tracks so you can listen to any song  you feel like, and again, the video doesn't let you do that, unless you  want to fast-forward and rewind the hell out of the tape.<br />So in the  long-run, the CD's are a better deal for S&amp;M.
B0000024RZ|4.0|Like much of Dylan's earlier albums, this one contains songs that are very political (the title track, and Only A Pawn In Their Game, which speaks with bite of racism), tragedies (The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll), and  war (With God On Our Side).  But like many of his albums, there is humor  and some aspects of love songs (Boots of Spanish Leather).  Always a voice  to hear and songs always worth hearing.
B00004U45G|5.0|These guys mesh together and make these songs sound fresh.  If you have interest in either of these bands (Crowes or Zep) this won't disappoint!  Hope to see you at one of the shows, I'll be there, if you can't buy this  album and play it everyday!
1559409010|5.0|Monty Python's Life of Brian of Nazareth is as magnificent as it is misunderstood.<br />I saw it when it hit theatres, despite picket lines.  The  pope of the time pronounced it &quot;Blasphemy&quot;.  I'd like to send a  little grateful prayer to his late holiness for helping the film more than  any other advertising could have ever done.  If he had taken the time to  actually WATCH it - he would have seen (as the Pythons say often in the  intoxicating commentaries in the DVD version) that it was HERESY - not  blasphemy.  <br />It lampooned the Church, and hyper-zealous ditto-heads that  equate THEIR own flavor of church with God.  &quot;I'm NOT the Messiah -  HONESTLY!&quot;...&quot;I say you are, my lord, and I should know!  I've  followed a few!&quot;<br />THE most believable and respectful portrayal of  Jesus of Nazareth is in this film!  He looks Jewish - for the first time in  a film i ever saw!  And when people at the outside reaches of the Sermon on  the Mount instantly misinterpreted His Beatitudes that just sums up 98% of  the religious grandstanders, coat-tail-riders, and wannabes!  &quot;Blessed  are the CHEESE makers?&quot;  &quot;It's not meant to be taken literally,  it refers to all manufacturers of dairy products!&quot;<br />Now.  IF they had  made the film like the first few formative ideas they had for the project  (from the admittedly irreverent &quot;Jesus Christ - Lust For Glory&quot;)  then i could see SOME of the outcry making SOME sense.  As it is, they just  totally failed to &quot;GET it&quot;.<br />Besides.  It takes equal oportunity  fatal stabs at politics!  Listen to Reg, the leader of the PFJ!  (or is it  JPF?)  As you do, sure thoughts of devisive religious groups (sorry  Southern Baptists) ARE inevitable... but i counsel that you look at the  political and historical aspect as well!<br />This is my favorite film.  Of  all.  End o'story.<br />Anyway.  The DVD is worth ten times its price!  The  Lost Scenes are worth double the price(i recommend watching them in  reverse order, they &quot;get better&quot; that way).  The commentaries are  an absolute must-have for fanatical Pythonians! Sue me, Monty Python is my  equivalent of the Dallas Cowboys (or whatever team(s) sports fans collect)!   Yes, i DO have Monty Python Trading Cards! Very proud of them.<br />The point  is - GET THIS DVD! Then - if necessary - buy a DVD player to watch it on!
B00003W8NM|5.0|There is a need to avoid ruining this film for the unfortunate souls that haven't challenged themselves with it!  So the trailers and even some of the word of mouth lead me astray.  I too thought it was probably going to  be &quot;Top Gun meets Toughest Man In The World wrestling&quot;.  The  trailer did have touches of brilliance from the Tyler monologues, so i  didn't dismiss it.<br />What made me finally go was that it was added to the  Midnight Movie list of my local Landmark Theatre, the Inwood in Dallas.   I've only seen ONE &quot;bad&quot; film there, and even it was  enjoyable!<br />CAVEAT - PLEASE beware of setting people up with too high  expectations, like i did!  I was telling everyone it was the best film of  all time.  Sue me.  I was under the influence or brilliance, and genuine  originality.  But as a result some of my friends had what i call the  &quot;Fargo&quot; experience.  (If i hadn't heard how Earth-Vaporizingly  Magnificent Fargo was, i would have probably enjoyed it immensely.)<br />Fight  club is outstanding.  But if they mentally multiply Citizen Kane by Dr.  Strangelove, stir in Life Of Brian to taste, and subtract (shudder)  Starshi* Troopers... they may actually be disappointed.<br />*Side Note* -  (like the rest wasn't &quot;side&quot; enough) i convinced my dear friend  to enjoy this movie with my help.  She has completely lost her vision in  recent years, and so i rented it, and paused it to answer questions and  supply crucial visual cues.  I needed to be able to discuss it with her,  and i felt uniquely qualified, or at least willing to help her  &quot;watch&quot; it.  She loved it.  I had learned my caveat at that  point.<br />So.

B000002U8G|5.0|It is commonly believed that Pink Floyd first achieved greatness with Dark Side of The Moon.  There is no disputing the fact that Dark Side was a groundbreaking album, and is probably Floyd's greatest, but Meddle deserves  the title of &quot;Breakthrough&quot;.  While Dark Side, Wish You Were  Here, and The Wall each have brilliant concepts and are on the whole  probably better albums, Meddle has a unique quality to it that is lacking  in all other Floyd albums.  And then, of couse, it has Echoes.  Echoes is,  in my opinion, the greatest Pink Floyd song of all.  I do not look at it as  the last of the space age psychedelic trip outs, and the first sign of  Floydian brilliance, but as an enormously succesful blend of the wonderfuly  eery works of their past, for example, Set the Controls for the Heart of  the Sun, and the future harmony displayed in songs like Time, Shine On You  Crazy Diamond, and Comfortably Numb.  I agree that Dark Side was the album  in which it all came together, but Echoes was the song in which everything  under the sun was in tune, and it's beauty and the wonder it inspires will  never be eclipsed by the more popular and well known successes.  Meddle is  essential to any Pink Floyd collection.
0783225970|5.0|This is the best film ever made.
B000006TRV|4.0|The Wall is album that has spawned a small cottage industry, from movie, to books, to an elaborate series of concerts to a live album of those concerts.  Lost in all of that is the album contains some of Floyd's best  music.  The album's production may be the real star as the listener is  treated to a sonic symphony complete with sound effects. The songs merge  into one another seamlessly. This album is basically a Roger Waters' solo  album as David Gilmour is the only other Floyd member to perform.  Waters  explores familiar Floyd themes of isolation, paranoia and mental madness.  The beginning strech from &quot;In The Flesh?&quot; to &quot;Mother&quot;  might be the best Floyd has ever recorded.  The album drags a bit in the  middle as some of the songs are a bit extreneous and rework early themes.  This middle section keeps it from being a five star album.  The album picks  up again with the FM Radio classic &quot;Comfortable Numb&quot; until its  conclusion of &quot;Outside The Wall&quot;.  Although the album has some  flaws, they are small ones. It is a great record and worth a listen.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones really out do themselves with this album.  Affirmation is a c.d. full of emotion that lets listeners know they're not alone.  this c.d. can really reach out and touch your heart!
B00000255F|5.0|Born To Run is the album that took Bruce Springsteen from a struggling recording artist who was almost dropped by his label to simultaneous covers of Time &amp; Newsweek.  All the hype surrounding the album is justified as  it is a brilliant collection of songs.  From the opening haromica on  &quot;Thunder Road&quot; to the closing of the mini-opera  &quot;Jungleland&quot;, Bruce tells us about Wendy, Terry, Mary, The Magic  Rat &amp; Barefoot girl and we hear their stories.  Most of the songs deal  with escaping one's dull and dreary life for something better.  The means  of escape are the highways and backstreets.  &quot;Born To Run&quot; is an  all time classic and I get chills up my spine everytime I hear the opening  riffs.  &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; tells of the origins of the E  Street Band.  &quot;Meeting Across The River&quot; is underated and when  Bruce played it on his recent tour, it got huge applauses.  The production  has the a big sound to it.  On some songs it sounds like a hundred  instruments are playing. Bruce wanted a Phil Spector Wall of Sound feel and  the album achieves that goal.  Jon Landau, his future manager, said after  seeing Bruce in concert in 1974 that &quot;he just saw the future of rock  'n' roll&quot;. Born To Run helped fulfill that prophecy.
0790729644|5.0|Eastwood hands up his hallmark performance both as an actor and director in Unforgiven, a film that offers an unblinking examination of the myth of the old west.<br />There are no heroes in this film. Hackman, Eastwood,  Freeman, and Harris all portray reformed or semi-reformed  gunslinger/murderers, each of whom have found their own way to deal with  the dark pall their past acts set over their lives.<br />Everyone gets set on  a collision course when a young prostitute is savagely slashed by an irate  cowboy. She survives the attack, and the punishment handed down by Sheriff  Little Bill (Hackman)is so inconsequential that the other Bordello girls  (led by Francis Fisher) place a bounty on the head of the cowboy. Munny  (Eastwood's character) hears of the bounty after being contacted by a brash  young gunslinger the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), a relative of one of  Munny's former outlaw friends. Munny is eventually drawn into the murder  for hire scheme, with dire consequences for all involved.<br />Eastwood,  Freeman, Hackman, and Harris all hand up great performances with a  supporting cast that strikes just the right notes. There are no &quot;man  with no name&quot; characters in this film. No unbelievably brave  characters set against a dramatic western skyline. Instead, Munny is  plagued by guilt and regret, and spends more than a little time blaming his  wife's premature death on his past ways. Munny has to focus on the fragile  existence of his two small children on a failing hog farm to scare up any  enthusiasm whatsoever for this mission, and Eastwood's performance of  Munny's half heartedness in this regard is superb.<br />This film has been  criticized for its' ending, which has been said to give in to the very  western mythology that it was trying to de-bunk. However, I don't see it  that way. The violence and the threats of violence are gratuitous, but they  usually are when fueled by alcohol and grief. These scenes fold neatly into  the story line without hitting any false notes.<br />Easily one of the top ten  Westerns ever made (it's in my top five). Strong buy.
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance is perhaps one of the most perfectly crafted works of modern music. It is a fine example of music completely transcending the commonplace and the mere mortal into a realm of never never land.  Incorperating the musical genres of folk (And It Stoned Me), jazz (too many  examples to list), soul tinged gospel (Crazy Love) and Tin Pan Alley (Come  Running), Van perfected his ecletic celebratorary approach to music with  this album. Every cut is a masterpiece that can either be enjoyed on its  own merits or as part of a larger whole. Whether enjoying a sentimental  reflection, a romantic evening or simply a restful respite from the noise  and confusion of the world, Moondance is the perfect work to help your  &quot;soul and spirit fly into the mystic.&quot; a 10 out of 5 stars. It is  that good.
B00000JCB2|3.0|I really like Limp Bizkit.  I realize that they have some odd tendencies and Fred Durst is a goofy white boy, but I can't help liking their songs.  When they all come together, they are a really great band.  Songs like  Nookie really demonstrate their ability to synthesize great music (the part  that really makes the band, which is seemingly overlooked by everyone) and  tight, often thoughtfull lyrics.  This album has several songs that are  instant classics.  The aforementioned Nookie, N2Gether (w/ the amazing  Method Man), Re-Arranged etc. are everything that is good about the  band.<br />The problem with this album, as opposed to their stellar Three  Dollar Bill Y'all album, is that there are a lot of tracks that are just  clunkers.  Perversely, on this album, LB both advance and diminish their  sound.  On the tracks that move forward, the listener is treated to pure  joy, on those that don't, the listener forgets instantly, at best or is  otherwise pained.<br />This album is overall worth the purchase if you are a  Limp Bizkit fan.  Unfortunately, not everything is as good as Nookie, so if  that is all you know, you might be dissapointed.
B0000027RK|5.0|A lot of times these days we find that Bands are becoming less and less skillfull on their instrument and sounding more and more alike. Pearl Jam is an extremely original and extremely talented band. Ten (by far their  best CD) is absolutely amazing. Eddie Vedder uses his rich baritone voice  to make the beautiful lyrics he writes powerful and pronounced. The  melodies of the singing are very innovative and the guitar and bass are  orginal, complicated and well meshed. The guitar solos stand out and  literally capture your focus to how cool they are. Guitarists will  appreciate this album and those who have lost faith in modern rock will  gain some back. Run to get this album.
B000000HTO|2.0|I'm kind of torn on this album. It has moments of sheer brillance and greatness, but in large part epitomizes why progressive rock faded from favor. It forgets that music ultimately needs to be musical - a simple  rule, but one that this album frequently forgets then remembers which makes  this album a somewhat frustrating listening experience (this is a rule that  the mighty Yes frequently breaks as well). Flighty lyrics thrown over  multi-instrument riffs doesn't necessarily make music. If you want to hear  a more \\"musical\\" progressive rock album, try Transatlantic's  SMPTe. Also, if you want to hear what a Hammond organ is capable of, buy an  ELP album, or better yet, see Keith Emerson live in concert. This album  will stay in the collection to see if it improves with continued listening,  but it doesn't get any more stars.
630204135X|5.0|Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece, and among the handful of greatest films ever made.  Unlike so many other great films (\\"Citizen Kane\\" comes to mind) however, it is a difficult movie, one that works on so many different  levels that it is virtually impossible fully to appreciate it with a single  viewing.  It rewards multiple viewings, with each new viewing like another  visit to an increasingly familiar locale that continues to surprise and to  reveal its terrain in new ways.<br />Definitely a film worth seeing,  discussing, mulling over, and seeing again.
6305537798|5.0|1.  The actors actually look like they belong in high school.<br />2.  The script doesn't make teenagers sound like \\"Clueless\\" clones and actually maintains some of Shakespeare's wit.<br />3.  The cast has strong chemistry  which lends a pleasing, and surprising, naturalness to their  performances.<br />4.  The movie doesn't feel like a commercial for Maybelline  or Calvin Klein.<br />5.  The main characters aren't sugar-coated; there's  something charming yet detestable about all of them.<br />6.  Julia Stiles can  dance.<br />7.  Heath Ledger can sing.<br />8.  The movie tries less to simplify  high school as a battle between good and evil and more as a struggle to  gain independence and a sense of self.<br />9.  There's nothing overly preachy  here (i.e., don't be mean to dorks, beauty is on the inside, etc.).<br />10.   Freddie Prinze, Jr. isn't in it.
6304508611|5.0|&quot;Carrie&quot; is one heck of a movie. It's horror and drama all wrapped up in one. Sissy Spacek plays the timid Carrie White, a girl who is tormented by her classmates, and abused by her religious fanatic mother,  Margaret (Piper Laurie). No one likes her, except for her gym teacher Miss  Collins (Betty Buckley), but after a terrible prank in the girls locker  room, one of the pranksters, Sue Snell (Amy Irving) feels sorry for what  she did and asks her popular football player jock boyfriend Tommy (William  Katt) to ask Carrie to the prom. He agrees and for once, the audience is  happy for Carrie, seeing she is having a great time at the prom, but the  evil Chris Hargenson (Nancy Allen) decides to pull a prank on Carrie that  proves all too deadly. This film is fantastic. It is a cross between drama  (the first half) and complete horror (the second half). The weird thing is,  you really do feel sorry for Carrie! The way she is tormented by her  classmates and her mother is awful, but the viewer knows about her new  &quot;powers&quot; and she really makes use of them during that prom! By  the way, in case anyone is confused by this, Carrie was imagining her  classmates laughing at her, they really weren't. Based on the novel by  Stephen King, it spawned numerous imitations and was followed by a sequel  23 years later.
B00000JJQK|3.0|When released in 1966, this album got as high as no 10 on the charts, and faded from the top 40 after 21 weeks.Wouldn't it be nice got to no 8 , and God only knows got to no 39. This is o.k., but only just that! This album  is not a earth shattering release. The beatles &quot;sergeant pepper&quot;  no 1 for 15 weeks and on the charts for 63 weeks was a earth shattering  event! Listen to this if you like, but when your ready to move on ,  sergeant pepper, rubber soul, abbey road, revolver, the white album, dark  side of the moon, led zeppelin 1-5, and on and on await you!
0393307050|5.0|It's hard to believe I only discovered the Aubrey/Maturin novels last fall. Since first reading &quot;Master and Commander&quot;, Jack Aubrey &amp; Stephen Maturin, their shipmates &amp; their families, have come to  seem like members of our family to both myself &amp; my husband!<br />If  &quot;Master and Commander&quot; is your introduction to the novels of  Patrick O'Brian (as it should be), it may take awhile to become accustomed  to the formality of the language. Think Jane Austen at sea, &amp; you'll  have some idea of their flavor. Pretty soon tho, the action will grab you  &amp; the pages will turn faster than you thought possible! Just make sure  to savor the humor that infuses so many of the interactions &amp;  observations; you'll be laughing out loud without even realising it!<br />Just  be warned: if you buy this book it will probably only be the beginning for  you.  There are 20 Aubrey/Maturin novels in all, plus numerous books (the  best by Dean King) that will provide maps, nautical &amp; historical  definitions, recipes etc. to help you more fully appreciate every aspect of  Patrick O'Brian's creation. You'll want them all. You will want to check  out some of the excellent web sites that elaborate upon these novels.  You'll even find yourself reading biographies &amp; histories of the  period! In short, when you buy &quot;Master &amp; Commander&quot; you are  starting a whole new hobby! Enjoy!
B00003CX59|5.0|Johnny Depp is brilliant! I consider Sleepy Hollow the best Tim Burton Film ever created. It's original and packed with suspense and gore. I wanted to see Sleepy Hollow in theaters but never got to. If you'r like me  (i love horror)I would highly recommend it. Sleepy Hollow rules! Although I  do have five words of cation: NOT for the weak-stomached.
0684867621|5.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan and have read as many of his books as I can get my hands on.  This story was one I couldn't put down , it's the only one I have read from begining to end without putting it down.  I couldn't  wait to see if this little girl would overcome the odds facing her on her  &quot;journey&quot; through the forest. It's not quite a horror book, but  as many true fans would know of Stephen King's books it doesn't have to  involve supernatural things to be great.
0312952813|4.0|The Black Ice was my 5th Michael Connelly novel. I ran out and bought it after I finished The Black Echo. I thoroughly enjoyed The Black Ice the whole way through. I thought that the idea and concept of the plot was very  neat. The ending is the thing that shocked me. This book had to do with the  smuggling and production of a drug called Black Ice. It links the plant  down in Mexico with some murders in the Hollywood/ LA area. That means  Harry Bosch is on the case, and that's a good thing. This was not my  favorite Connelly novel but close to it.
0780628551|2.0|Like many viewers, my expectations were low. It's a shame. Some good performances are really wasted here. Johnny Depp is truly creepy as his face twists into its more intense form while the movie drones on. Most of  the secondary actors were pretty good (esp. Donna Murphy and Joe Morton).  Charlize Theron was not enough to carry the movie though.<br />The plot was  ho-hum, and it was paced poorly. None of the relevations were surprising,  or interesting. The &quot;twist&quot; ending was executed poorly. Some  pretty high lameness all around.<br />Only get this if you are a big fan of  the principal performers.
0780631153|1.0|Help!  What was this movie's ending about?  Please someone TELL ME!
B00004SCX6|2.0|ok is it just me or is this cd full of tasteless 'singing'? all the fast songs have the same beat as 'oops i did it again', especially 'what you see is what you get'. and whats up with 'dear diary'?  it sounds way childish.  the only good songs on here are 'lucky' and 'what you see is what you get'.  'satisfaction' is the weirdest song. full of 'uhs' and funny sounding  growls. hate to say it but her 1st cd is much much better
B00004HYLF|5.0|I used to play cuts from this on college radio some 20 years ago, and the grooves were white back then.  There was nothing like this - nothing more inventive, trippy, or creative on the market.  Now getting the CD (finally)  some 20 years later, it sounds just as fresh as day 1 - this was serious  jazz fusion, and paved the way for other artists like Jean Luc Ponty and  Brand X to explore the outer ends of jazz/fusion. Thanks to classics like  this, the roadmap was laid out and all fusion lovers lived off it!<br />This  CD was a true groundbreaker, and is hard to even classify this as 'jazz',  as, even 20 yrs back, this crossed the barrier.  If you want to hear where  a lot of great non-traditional, jamming, off-meter session music came from,  this is IT.  But, heck, this CD simply is a wake-up call to all the dung  that jazz has been buried under due to modern radio (smoooooooth jazz).  If  ya love hot instrumentals in a not metered tone, this CD is a MUST!
0553573403|5.0|Having just finished reading AGoT, I can honestly state that I have very rarely read a fantasy as imaginative and daring as this one.  I have read lots of fantasy (Tolkien, Williams, Donaldson, Feist, Weis &amp; Hickman,  Goodkind, Jordan, Eddings, ad nauseum.), and this stands out from the  crowd.<br />The storyline is incredible and always keeps you guessing.  Martin  will do whatever it takes to further the story in a realistic way.  As so  many reviewers have stated in the past, there is a moral greyness  surrounding the characters that adds interest to the story.<br />You may  have noticed that in the title, I stated that this book was not for  everyone, and indeed, it is not.  If violence and/or sexual situations make  you uncomfortable, then you may find this book unsettling.  The violence  and sex are not gratuitous; instead, they help show you the realities of  the world as it was. I have no problem with this, but I have seen several  reviewers who are looking for an escape to a happy fairy-land fantasy,  which this most definitely is not.  Also, if you enjoy having every  character in a novel capable of levelling a city with a thought or tossing  fireballs about like confetti (i.e., The Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth  books, among others), then you will be disappointed; the magic in this book  is subtle and mysterious, to both the characters and the reader.<br />I have  read only three other works of Fantasy that are on par with Martin's work,  and they are Tad Williams' Memory, Sorrow and Thorn Trilogy, Donaldson's  Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, and of course, Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.  Of all of these, Martin's works remind me most of Memory, Sorrow and Thorn,  which he claims was part of his inspiration for writing in this genre.<br />Martin's prose is extremely well written, with the descriptions bringing  things to life in your mind.  The dialogue is also brisk and clever.  The  story is told from multiple points of view, which adds suspense and flavor  to the story, as well as allowing the author to bring each character to  life, making us love them sometimes and hate them at other times.<br />If you  are sick of bloated and repetitious fantasy where everyone is omnipotent  and characters are static and boring, pick of A Game of Thrones and its  sequel, A Clash of Kings - I promise that you won't be disappointed.ense and flavor  to the story, as well as allowing the author to bring each character to  life, making us love them sometimes and hate them at other times.<br />If you  are sick of bloated and repetitious fantasy where everyone is omnipotent  and characters are static and boring, pick of A Game of Thrones and its  sequel, A Clash of Kings - I promise that you won't be disappointed.
B000002O51|5.0|I've never heard of a band waiting 8 years for there next release unless they broke up.Boston's third album is just as good as the first two,but Boston fan's hated &quot;Amanda.&quot;I love the song,and it was a huge  hit,but everyone thought they sold out with this number.&quot;We're  Ready,&quot; is another one of my favorites from the album.Its like  Boston's telling us after 8 years there back.&quot;Cool the Engines&quot;  is a fantastic hard rock song,and all the rock stations played this one  alot when the record came out.This was the last huge album for Boston.All  it took was three great albums to make there mark in rock and roll music.
B000002H97|1.0|Up until 1990 there was a great band called Metallica with some of the most inventive and original hard music ever. Then they decided to become more vanilla, appeal to what MTV wanted to play instead of what the band  was about. Tired overused riffs and songs that pale in comparison with the  ones that came before, this album only really appeals to those who feel  whatever MTV played must be great. Metallica fans who had been there since  the beginning were stabbed in the back. I found it ironic that in an  interview Hetfield was asked how long-time fans probably felt about them  after this album was released. He said 'They probably hate us'. He was  right. This album showed that the band was in it for the bucks, and not for  the music any longer. (A theory only made stronger by the recent Napster  ridiculousness). So if you can't handle hard-core rock and need something  more mainstream, by all means get this record. If you are true to the genre  avoid it and all the garbage that has followed it and purchase Kill 'em  All, Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice for All. Those  are worth every penny. But not this.
B0000025C0|5.0|&quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is another  Masterpiece.The overdubbed guitar's,and Tom Scholz production is equal to Boston's last record.The first single,&quot;Don't Look Back&quot; is wonderfull,but my favorite song  is &quot;A Man I'll never be.&quot; Brad Delp has one of the greatest male  voice's I've ever heard in my life.Its ashame this will be the last Boston  record we will hear untill 1986.By taking so long between albums,Boston  lost alot of fan's,but there next record was worth the wait.
B0000041Z6|3.0|Yes, pretty clear sound. I didn't care much for Mr. Solti's interpretations though. His first, third, and fourth symphonies are weak. I did especially like the sixth, seventh, and eighth though. I thought they  were somewhat acceptable for Mahler, especially the eighth, which is the  best in the box.<br />The performance of the first is weak and somewhat fast.  Solti obviously couldn't accomplish anything here, and decided to zoom  through with little effort. The second wasn't bad. His third is somewhat  choppy. The solo parts fly through muting the percussionists. Some  instruments which are played really have no use in the orchestra. They'll  be playing while a more powerful brass sound throws them off. Or Solti  would space them off because he didn't know what to do with them in the  first place. The whole thing really was a tad sloppy. Not too bad. Alot of  conductors have been lost conducting this sophisticated sympony. The fifth  and sixth were okay. Some instruments really didn't have a significance in  these performances by the way Solti conducted though. I enjoyed the  seventh. Even more than Bernstein's seventh. The night to light theme seems  to shine more in this performance. And of course, everybody know Solti's  eight is the best of the best. The ninth came up sounding well. According  to my score of three stars, the excellent London/Decca sound job deserves  one star, one star for the second and seventh symphony performances, and  one star for the eighth symphony performance. If all these performances  were more distinguishable and qualified to Mahler fan tastes, I may give  this set a four.

0385495315|5.0|I read the book from cover to cover in one sitting and then eagerly dashed to the website to learn more about the cipher challenge that author Singh poses to those of us who think, gee this seems easy, I could take a crack  at it. From Egyptian hieroglyphics to Elizabethan intrigue to modern-day  Internet encryption, the book eloquently covers the ways in which humans  have used codes and ciphers to conquer and cover up their activities. While  I was vaguely aware of the Rosetta Stone and the role of Navajo codetalkers  during the War, the book made me realize how complex the field is and how  slow the progress has been over centuries to refine and evolve these  secretive methods of communication. Singh's style is never stuffy or dry. I  will be sure to read Fermat's Last Theorem.
6305537798|5.0|Well yes I admit, there was no masquerading as teachers, there was no food deprovation, but the main plot points of Shakespere's classic the taming of the shew where still there (at least in the beginning) and I find that 10  things I hate about you is a very good movie. The sotryline is very funny  and the music is amazing. Letters to Cleo put on a great show! If you like  romantic comedies go see this movie!
0792833201|3.0|Poltergiest was alright. The only scary part was the part with the clown, but other than that it wasn't all that great. The Blair Witch Project was scarier than that. But it was neat and scary for it's time.
B000002J2D|5.0|&quot;And Then There Were Three&quot; is one of Genesis' very best albums. It was a big departure for the band, certainly--no more Steve Hackett on guitar, the band shrinking down to a trio (hence the album's title), and  the inclusion of more songs than on previous albums, and *shorter* songs at  that. But, oh, what songs! Some of my all-time favorite Genesis songs are  found here--&quot;Down &amp; Out&quot;, &quot;Snowbound&quot;,  &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, &quot;Deep In The Motherlode&quot;, &quot;Many  Too Many&quot;, &quot;The Lady Lies&quot;, and of course, &quot;Follow You  Follow Me.&quot; The whole feel to this album just sweeps me away, and the  band's musicianship, with Tony Banks' dreamy, lush keyboard work leading  the way, is top-notch, too. Of course, Phil Collins' first-rate drumming  &amp; vocals remain in a class all by themselves, and credit must also be  given to Mike Rutherford for picking up the guitar here with great gusto  (he'd been mostly the group's bassist prior to making this album). It  must've been just as challenging for him to take over for Steve Hackett as  it was for Collins to take over for Peter Gabriel at the microphone, but  Rutherford does it brilliantly, displaying for the first time his *own*  powerful, unique sound &amp; style on lead guitar. I know &quot;And Then  There Were Three&quot; went over some fans' heads. Some fans saw the album  as &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; for Genesis, because it broke the  band away from their &quot;prog&quot; past, and sent them on the road to  Top 40 hits &amp; record sales glory. Yes, this was their most commercialy  accessible album up to that time, but it still contains all the sweeping  atmospheres, moods, and musical chops of earlier Genesis. The number of  band members may have shrunk &amp; the running time on the songs may have  shrunk, but NOT the incredible power of the band's music.If I have to name  my favorite album from the band's 1978-91 era, I will happily say &quot;And  Then There Were Three.&quot; I think all the Genesis albums that have  followed this one are great, but &quot;And Then There Were Three&quot; is  definitely my favorite from the Phil/Mike/Tony line-up.
B000002NG7|5.0|With this amazing and undescriptible album, Faith No More ends his productive and breath-taking career. This was thier perfect final album. With the keyboards from Angel Dust and the guitars from King For a Day,  they made their most balanced CD. The songs are so impressive, that can't  be defined with words, you just have to listen to them. But, anyway, I  would like to talk about every song of the album with just one word for  each one:<br />- Colission: Speed. - Stripsearch: Loneliness. - Last Cup of  Sorrow: Thick. - Naked in Front of the Computer: Hardcore. - Helpless:  Acoustic. - Mouth to Mouth: Oustanding. - Ashes to Ashes: Guitar. - She  Loves me not: funny. - Got that feeling: Scream. - Paths of Glory: Darkest.  - Home, sick Home: Strange. - Pristina: death.<br />Their second best album  (their best is Angel Dust).
B00003Q43A|1.0|Where do you start with this heap of junk? The dreadful dialogue, the pig of a plot, the insult to you intelligence.... where?<br />We should be able to watch a film and accept it for what it is - being far-fetched shouldn't  mean that you can't sit back, suspend your disbelief for two hours and have  a good time. However, to do that with Independence Day is simply asking too  much of any (semi-)intelligent person.<br />The start of the film is promising  and from the word go the special effects are awesome and at times  breathtaking. Special effects though do not a movie make and it doesn't  take long for the plot to start to fall apart. The coincidences start early  and continue to mount up with a speed bordering on the insane.... ie, only  guy in the world who deciphers the coded countdown signal (forget NASA and  all the billion dollar Russian and American military spy satellites, this  guy works for a TV station!) just happens to be the 'ex' of the President's  assistant which gets him access, yadda, yadda, yadda.... give me a break!  And of course, that's just the start. I could effortlessly use up all 1,000  words of this review taking the plot's outrageous coincedences  apart.<br />Other questions.... why would a ship suspend itself over LA... to  crush the militarily important Hollywood movie industry? How come the  governments of the world couldn't work out the Aliens' intentions were  hostile when they'd positioned themselves menacingly over all of the  earth's strategic hotspots and made no effort at all to make contact? When  that 14-mile wide spaceship crashed at the end why didn't flatten the base  below (remember, the one it was hovering over to destroy) and why wasn't  there an earth tremor that went off the richter scale when it's billions  and billions of tons of weight crashed from the sky.... so many questions  and so few answers!   <br />The coincidences are so contrived, as is the  dialogue, and the plot so dreadfully predictable that it becomes an insult  to the intelligence and is simply impossible to enjoy... unless your brain  hurts when you try to think for yourself or you have a mental age of 14 or  below... or if you are 14 or below!<br />It's all a shame really because the  effects ARE terrific and this movie COULD have been so much more. I love  the sci-fi genre but this is a poor addition to it.<br />Even if I could have  voted for no stars at all I would still have given it one. The DVD extras  are good and it's only fair to say that. If other films went to as much  trouble then we'd all be a lot happier with our DVDs!<br />Great package,  dreadful film with no credibility whatsoever (and that's saying something  for a scifi film!).... I just pray they don't try and make a sequel.
B000002LRX|5.0|Well, I bought this album back in 1993, and since then, it's the only album that I've heard that never, ever, has bored me. Every song of the album is so spectacular, and yet so different from the others, that I can't choose one to be my favorite one. The album, itself, it's my all-time  favorite one. You have to listen to it to know what I am talking about. If  you are a metal fan, or a funk fan, or a rap fan, or a pop fan, or an  alternative music fan, or just a good music fan, this is the album for you.  ....
6305308659|5.0|While this starts out as your typical comedy movie it rapidly changes to something really wonderful.<br />I own the Region 2 version of this DVD and I'm not quite sure if there's differences with the Region 1 version but I  must say this DVD has a lot of goodies.<br />The usual 'Making Of',  biographies, interviews etc. And the video for Across The Universe by Fiona  Apple. Which I'm rather fond of. <br />Okay the movie itself: As most of you  know, 2 90's kids get zapped into a TV show. While this could have been a  lame concept, I mean it's been done before, it turns out quite lovely.  <br />As the 2 main characters explore the fantasy world of a 50's comedy, one  wants to keep things as they are, the other is bored and annoyed with the  'goody goody' world, and has an unusual effect on the makebelief world. She  exposes the characters to new ideas and customs and ends up changing the  whole fabric of their world. Here the FX come in. While initially the world  is Black and White, since it's a 50's TV show, the people that change turn  to color. What happens? You end up with mixed colored and black and white  scenes. It's spectacular to see.  I should stop here with the synopsis or  else I'll spoil the movie for the ones that haven't seen it :-) So to end  this:<br />The comedy is not over the top and the storyline is never lost and  there's a good message in the movie. Combine that with fantastic special FX  and a great musical score and you have a great movie. Change is the basic  theme of the movie.  Change as in opening your mind and being an  individual. And about the fact that a lot of people that reject  individuality and other ideas. <br />Go see it please. It's simply amazing
0425170349|2.0|The first half of this novel will not disappoint fans of Mr Clancy's previous thrillers.   The prose is tightly written (as usual) and the plot intriguing.   As expected after Executive Orders, Jack Ryan has reached his  `use-by' date.    He's the President.  He's saved the world from  devastation (nuclear, biological and financial).   Tom can't really wring  much more out of the character because he's already `been-there done-that'   -and come out the other side, still the cool, smart, moral man's man.    He's got nowhere left to go, except to fade into obscure statesmanhood.    So the main characters in this novel are John Clark and Ding Chavez.   For  that reason, I approached this novel with caution, wondering if they were  really broad enough to bear the weight of the book on their own.   They  are.     <br />It is not the characterization, or action that kills this  novel.  It is not the controversial plotline of environmentalists so  radical as to threaten the survival of the human race.   I've read far more  bizarre things than this, and still been happy to go along for the ride.     <br />The problem here was research, or perhaps a lack of it.   It stopped the  novel dead, particularly when the action moved to Sydney for the Olympics.    The Australian setting could have been any large city in any  English-speaking country.   The only reason we knew it was Sydney was  because Tom told us.    (I've got a vague memory that he even refers to  Melbourne instead earlier in the book)    The one or two small details he  drops into the story, like the road the Rainbow team takes from the  airport, are incorrect.   The Olympic site could have been nearly any large  sporting arena, but not the real one at Homebush bay.   The few Australians  we meet are washed-out photocopies of British army officers, with dialog to  match   I've heard of Australians calling men `blokes', and `guys', but  never `chaps'! Similar errors of detail occur earlier in the book, with  mistakes on the location of Hereford, and the speed limit in the UK.  <br />These are not major criticisms of the novel, whose prime focus centers  on John Clark and his Rainbow organization, but whenever I read a Clancy  novel now, even when I re-read the earlier ones, I will be wondering just  how much is well researched, and just which details he couldn't be bothered  to find out, so made up instead..   <br />It's hard to believe that a writer  of Mr Clancy's obvious experience and talent, would let such a poorly  researched book loose in a genre so preoccupied with detail.
0780625129|1.0|I submitted a review of this before - But it must have gotten lost somewhere.<br />American History X struck me as far too preachy and devoid of reality. The film is set in Venice Beach, California. A kind of tribalistic  environment where hate = survival. The story basically begins with a young  high school student named 'Danny', a fledgling Nazi Skinhead played by Ed  Furlong, who has submitted a glowing review of Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf'.  This ,of course, sends everyone into fits. As such, a Black councler named  'Sweeny' decides that Danny, in typical self-righteous fashion, must think  along more acceptable lines and therefore must submit a report on Civil  Rights - and the tone of the movie is set. (Why is it that Hollywood thinks  Blacks are synonymous with superior wisdom?)<br />The heartbeat of the story  revolves around Danny's brother 'Derek', a Nazi skinhead who is well played  by Ed Norton. Derek gets sent to prison one night because he violently  prevented the theft of his property: He kills a Black who was trying to  steal his truck. The roots of this attempted theft actually goes back to a  basketball game in which Derek and his friends defeat a group of Blacks -  Typical Hollywood fantasy. Anyway, In prison Derek does the right thing and  joins the skinhead gang inside. However, Derek soon finds himself along  side a Black laundry worker who 'wins' Derek because the Black guy just  misses sex so much. Of course Derek soon turns his back on his skinhead  comrades and they promptly rape him in the shower - Very ugly.<br />This rape  actually causes Derek to become a goody-goody - Unreal. Here is a man who  argues his ideology with passion, conviction and intelligence. I'm sorry,  but it's going to take alot more than this for him to change. The next  thing you know, Derek is trying to convince his brother Danny that  everything they stand for is 'wrong'. <br />The film does have some strong  points. There are flashbacks in black &amp; white that are somewhat  effective and a very good performance by Fairuza Balk as Dereks girlfriend.  But along with all the ghettocentric view on 'wasted potential' you could  want, American History X is one big obnoxious preachfest.
B00004STPT|5.0|This CD conveys so much with the beautiful vocals by Lisa Gerrard (end of #2, #5, #15-17) as well as with some of the powerful battle scene tracks (#3, #13).  I have been listening to this CD for over a month straight now,  I still don't get tired of it!  I'd recommend it to anyone, it's awesome!
0399143904|5.0|This is one of my favorite Clancy books. Jack Ryan gets thrown into the Presidential seat through a horrible accident, and from that moment he stays focused on his beliefs and morals, vowing not to become a politican.  Everyone around him is doubtful of him surviving the pressure, media  attention, and ability to lead our country. Ryan immediately takes charge  in his own honest, caring, humble ways, and starting with the Secret  Service agents, he quickly begins to command respect, and loyality.<br />They  (S.S agents) know this guy is different from other politicians they have  had to protect and although he makes it difficult for them to keep him  secure. They understand Ryan isn't doing things for future  &quot;votes&quot;, but because he CARES.  As he becomes more popular, an  ex-vice president decides Ryan's all wrong for the job he feels should be  his. Fear of terrorism begins investigations through FBI/CIA/NSA, and in  true Clancy form, a totally diffrent plot is beginning to develope across  the other side of the world. Ryan brings his militay perspective into play  with the developing terrorism information surfacing. World leaders and  terrorists beware! Ex-Marine/CIA Agent Jack Ryan Has a temper and you dont  want to be on the wrong side of that!  Clark and &quot;Ding&quot; are  superb (as usual) and the attention to detail that Clancy brings to his  stories keeps it all to REAL! The mix of ruthless killing and family  values, honor and deceit, religion and extinction, helps to make this book  very hard to put down for long. Tom: Keep em' coming !  Lets get these  remaining &quot; Ryan&quot; and &quot;Clark&quot; books on the silver  screen.  Thumbs up Mr. Clancy!
6305892946|1.0|This is the worst installment of the trilogy. Scream 1&amp;2 were good and scary because they redefined the movie genre. Scream 3, on the other hand, takes all the movie cliches that were intelligently avoided in the first  two films and crams them into 2 hours of nonsense. The characters here are  so stupid I actually wanted them to die. I mean, if you and a friend were  in a huge mansion in which a killer is on the loose, would you split up and  would you each go in a separate direction? I didn't think so... But the  people in that movie don't seem to agree now do they?
B00000IAU3|4.0|A lot of people have compared Dido to Sarah and Beth Orton.  They seem to forget Dolores Riordan, but I swear that the song &quot;My Lover's Gone&quot; sounds like Riordan to the tee.  Nevermind that though.  What  Dido has created is an airy album, heavy on the atmosphere, smooth on the  vocals, and as smoky as they come.  &quot;Here with me&quot; is beautiful.   &quot;Hunter&quot; only seems to open the door wider.  &quot;My Lover's  Gone&quot; is sullen yet so smooth.  &quot;Thank You&quot; the cut which is  heard in Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; is just as melancholy here.  The cuts  from &quot;Stan&quot; hardly sketch the rest of the song.  &quot;No  Angel&quot; is sharp and sexy.  I could go on and on.  This is the kind of  cd to slide in when lounging, sipping wine, and soaking in a lover's  essence.
B000000OMB|5.0|Here's an album that, despitre being disliked by its natural &quot;early adopters&quot; (progressive rock fans) as well as the mainstream press (who mistook it for a progressive rock album and exhibited their normal  knee-jerk prejudice against that particular genre), yet still went on to  sell millions of records!  It simply demonstrates that sometimes music  stands on its own merit, despite the efforts of some to knock it  down.<br />Asia had the makings of a progressive rock supergroup, with  veterans of ELP, King Crimson, and Yes making up its membership.  Hopes  were high among prog fans (who didn't have much to shout about during the  genre's &quot;dark days&quot; of 1982) that this band would carry the  torch. But when they heard the shorter, radio-friendly songs and  &quot;arena rock&quot; trimmings they were horrified. It wasn't prog, and  the shock of that realization was so great that they never gave it a  serious listen.  To this day, many progressive rock fans unfairly consider  Asia to represent the low point of the genre.  <br />On the other side, the  music press (who by that time despised progressive rock, largely out of  their own ignorance and fear of intellectualism) branded Asia with their  tried-and-true label of &quot;pretentious&quot;, based solely on the band's  provenance. Again, they apparently never listened to the music.<br />How can I  be so sure that both camps gave Asia a bad rap without giving it a chance?   Simply because it's great music!  No, it isn't prog, but as a prog fan I  stil find much to enjoy here, from the fnely crafted songs to the excellent  production, and most of all the superior musicianship (even if the band  isn't really challenged by the material).  No, it isn't the disco-pop of  the late 70s, but if the critics had given it a chance they could have  heard the gems contained within.<br />But in the end, the true judges - the  fans - won out, and this album became a worldwide sucess. It stands the  test of time well, and is highly recommended.
B000002A3T|5.0|It is often difficult to judge what is better than something else. This is extremely true in the case of Pink Floyd's music. Take a listen. Piper sounds nothing like Dark Side,Dark Side sounds nothing like The Wall, and  The Wall sounds nothing like the Division Bell. But these three albums in  my opinion best represent Pink Floyd at what they do best. In the case of  The Division Bell, Gilmour's soaring guitar, Wright's hypnotic keyboards,  and Mason's heart thumping drumming are still second to none. They are  trully the most talented musicians ever. The album constantly makes me cry.  Why? Because it is still amazing that a band that begun it's journey more  than thirty years ago still has new magic and mystique to add to music.  Barrett,Gilmour,Mason,Waters,and Wright along with a select few others  (Lennon,Mercury) will eventually become the Beethoven's and Mozart's of the  twentieth century. Quite simply put there is no one better than Pink Floyd.
0671034065|5.0|While every woman knows there is no such animal as &quot;Mr.Perfect,&quot; Jaine and her friends one Friday night make up a list of qulalities just in case. What starts out as fun, turns into murder, as some one is taking  exception to the Ladies of the List. Fast pace with great characters, Linda  Howard has penned another great summe read. Where last years &quot;All the  Queen's Men&quot; provoked controversy, this new selection with promote  envy over Sam. Everyone should have such a next door neighbor. He and Jaine  bring neighborhood relationships to new and sexy heights. This is a  wonderful way to end a very lack luster summer reading time. Lucky for us,  the best was saved for last....a MUST read.
6305165912|4.0|Commercially, &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; seemed a victim of heightened expectations, following the mainstream success of the Coen's &quot;Fargo.&quot;  That's a shame in a way, but it's also a testament to  the artistic integrity of the Coen brothers: They didn't yield to the  temptation (pressure?) to duplicate the formula of that earlier work in  order to simply bring in the dollars.  Good for them.<br />&quot;The Big  Lebowski,&quot; while certainly more loose in structure than  &quot;Fargo,&quot; succeeds largely on the strength of its often  wickedly-funny exchanges between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.  Anyone who  has known a &quot;Dude&quot; in his or her life will likely be won over by  Bridges' portrayal.  Also, Goodman's performance was a real revelation to  me, as he absolutely owned his role.<br />If I were to rate the movie based  purely on how much I liked it, I'd peg it at five stars for sure.  But hey,  I'm trying to be somewhat objective here: &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;  won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for folks who don't mind a rambling  stroll through a story line instead of a guided tour, it's worth a look.
B000009O8A|1.0|This movie is 100 minutes of nothingness.  Those who lambasted it might have overeacted; those who praised it were surely misguided.  The fact is  this movie is a complete waste of time -- both in watching it, and in  giving it a split second of thought afterwards.  Some of those who find  themselves liking it seem to like it because &quot;well, it wasn't as bad  as some critics said.&quot;  What a compliment.<br />This movie will satisfy  NO movie fans.  Fans of exploitation horror flicks will surely be  dumbfounded by the filmmaker's inept attempt to inject  &quot;seriousness&quot; to the material.  Those who looked for violence a  la Scream or Friday the 13th will be disappointed by how little the amount  and uncreative the effort.  Those who hope to see some soft-core  pornography will surely be let down (in more ways than one) because the  realistic way those rape scenes are filmed simply isn't designed to  titillate the viewer (those who enjoy watching them must be sadists or  potential rapists).<br />Some praise the realism of the rape scenes  (attributable to Camille Keaton's all-too-real performance as the victim)  and the supposedly feminist subtext in the scenes where the victim kills  her rapists for revenge.  But let's get real here.  Does the movie back up  these important real-life topics with any semblance of substance and  intelligence?  It sure as hell does not.  The story is of moronic  simplicity; long, meaningless scenes fill the gaps between the rapes and  the revenges.  The director simply counts on the mere images of a woman  being raped and her rapists being maimed and killed to fulfill his highly  questionnable purpose.  Such shallowness inpires the viewer to think: why  should I CARE?  And I didn't.<br />To see an example of a serious, artistic  film about a woman's rape and her rapists punished, one should check out  Ingmar Bergman's &quot;Virgin Spring&quot;.  Director Meir Zarchi could  have learned so much from it.
0060926317|5.0|I decided to write a review when'I read about the conspiracy surrounding this book. For me reading it has been a wake  up call. I get to see how irresponsibly I have lived, and still do, while people far away with no  connection to me have been holding the world together with their  consciousness. That the contents are genuine can be vouched for by the  touchstone of ones heart, one knows this to be truth, not for sensation.  Thank You Marlo Morgan for pointing out a way home.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Maiden displays a good mix of their best sounds..from Piece of Mind to Seventh Son.  Uniquely, my favorite tracks come later on the CD...(Track 9) Out of the Silent Planet, and (Track 10) Thin Line Between Love and Hate.   Great songs!  Nothing quite as memorable as the Trooper or Rhyme of the  Ancient Mariner, but, this mix of music works!  Maiden has always had that  tight sound that nobody else can mimmick.  The thump of the bass guitar and  drums is carried on throughout Brave New World, making the listening  experience...very, very enjoyable.  Welcome back boys!  See you on tour  with Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-l-ford!
B000002GBB|5.0|THE BEST ALBUM BY ANYONE PERIOD<br />'Message/Lords of the ring' and 'Pieces of eight' are in my top 10 songs by anyone (not just by Styx)- 5 stars<br />'Renegade', 'I'm OK', and 'Blue caller man' are all strong 4 stars- excellent<br />'Queen of spades' A good 3 1/2 or a weak 4 stars very good<br />'Sing for the day' a good 3 stars B to B+<br />'Aku..' and 'Great white hope' C+ to B-<br />One thing that sets Styx apart from all others is where most groups add instramental solos in the middle of their songs (usualy after a couple verses & choruses)before coming back with the final chorus, they basicaly  just play a bunch of razzle dazzle on the guitar, keyboard ect. just to prolong the song. Styx puts as much thought and creativity in the instramentation as they do the song itself.<br />(my next favorite album - Roxettes 'Have a Nice Day')
B00000294R|5.0|Big L was one of the best rappers that has ever lived. His lyrics explained things, such as in the song &quot;Ebonics&quot; he tells what all of the ebonic words mean. He told stories in his rhyms. Every time that he  had a concert of people hurd him they got excited. This album starts the  legacy of Big L. Big L: R.I.P.
0780622642|5.0|I first saw this movie on video when I rented it. I loved it! The VISUALS  in this thing are excellent. Yet, they don't match the stunning visual  vistas of The Phantom Menace. The story is a little weird, but it's Ok. It  also offers humor in the right places. The critics bombed this, but I loved  every minute of it. I recommend ths SUPER FUN movie.
0446677450|5.0|I first glanced through this at a bookstore, and just couldn't put it down. It flashed upon me that I had been programmed from birth to not be rich just because of the things taught by parents, the school system and  other non-rich friends and media.<br />This books delves into the mindset of  the rich, and hence by applying these principles in our lives, we should be  able to change our whole logic and understand money better. It all makes  sense now, the main idea to learn is &quot;Don't work for money, make money  work for you&quot;.<br />Hey, I always thought my house was my biggest asset  until I read this, and I now realise that is not so, and I agree with him  too. Some of his other advise is not very applicable to where I live, but  the key is understanding the way money (taxes etc) works.<br />I recommend  that you also get his free audio tape and the videos on his website  (Richdad). They made the information much clearer.
6305291489|5.0|This movie is one of the best I've seen. I'm 14 years old and I've seen plenty of movies, but this is one of the best. To me this is better than the original. The directing is great, the acting is superb(especially  Lindsay Lohan as Hallie/Annie). The chemistry between the characters in  this one os better than in the original. The cinematography is very  good(such as in the scene on the yacht, a very romantic glow)and the camp  on the lake. I recommend this movie definitely.
6305537798|5.0|I think that of the teen movies that have been out recently that this one is definitly worth watching. Sure some of the characters are stereotyped, but that's to give it a more universal feel. The plot of this movie has  been done before but this time around it is given a new twist. Sure dad's  everywhere don't want to see their daughters grow up but how many of dads  make them where &quot;the belly&quot; before going to a party? One of them  most outstanding things about this movie is that they cast real teenagers  in the roles instead of twenty something actors who haven't been in high  school for 5 years. The cast does such a good job that I like this movie  more every time I watch it. So if your looking for something to make you  laugh out loud then buy this film!
630575067X|5.0|This is a great movie for the family. It has no bad language in it, so it's Ok for little ones. It has no gory violence, not even bloody. The VISUAL EFFECTS are worthy of an award. Theed especially looks great. When  will George Lucas ever release this on DVD? The visuals are worthy of the  crystal clear quality that DVD offers. If you like the original Star Wars  films you will like this. The visual effects in this continue the trend  that A New Hope started. To summarize this, the movie is excellent  entertainment. And as I said above, it's Ok for the little ones. Nothing  offensive in it at all. I recommend this.
B00000G3PA|1.0|A typically relentless, attention-deficit-disorder spectacle from Michael Bay (\\"Bad Boys,\\" \\"The Rock\\"). An asteroid the size of Texas threatens Earth. Oil driller Bruce Willis and his trusty team of misfits (including  Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck, and Will Patton) are sent up to land on the  rock, drill a hole, drop a nuke into it, and blow it up from within. The  movie is a trashy combo of \\"The Dirty Dozen\\" and \\"The Right Stuff\\" - I  would say \\"cheerfully trashy,\\" but there's nothing especially cheerful  about Bay's hyperactive, insecure style that treats the audience like  morons, and the script makes almost no sense despite the work of many  uncredited hands. Still, it was Touchstone's biggest hit to date,  outearning their previous record-holder \\"Pretty Woman.\\" Aerosmith's awful  ballad \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" was actually nominated for an Oscar.  Thank God it lost.
B0000029AP|5.0|This certainly is Aerosmith at its best. &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; are still awesome songs, some 25 years after its release. But don't just get it for those songs, every song is great.

0783117388|1.0|The premise of this show is to portray shallow characters, leading empty, meaningless lives in an urban setting. There is little if any discussion of  the important things in life- spirituality, family, or anything beyond  immediate gratification through sex and relationships with other shallow  characters. If you truly find this show meaningful, and somehow related to  your life, you need to reexamine your priorities and values.
B00000064G|5.0|Yes, I'm another one of those people who heard the title track first on the VW commercial, which is especially embarrassing because I don't drive and I particularly hate car commercials. But I couldn't get the song out of  my mind, so I finally tracked down the artist and ordered the album, got it  in the mail today and am on my fourth listen already...<br />The acoustic  guitar coupled with Nick's voice is so utterly captivating, yet relaxing at  the same time - you simply must listen to understand.
B00003CX59|5.0|This movie has some of the best Cinematography I've seen. I really was surprised that this didn't win the oscar for Best Cinematography. The story is creepy and weird, but good. The characters are good too. I recommend  this to Tim Burton fans. Don't let the little ones see it though, the  decapitations are grisly enough to scare them into thinking it's real. This  is not for little kids. See It. That comment doesn't include youngsters of  ages 11 and under.
B000002J1I|3.0|Levelset: Certainly the worst Yes album released in the 70s, and for completist fans only. If I were anxiously waiting for this record back then, following the virtual perfection of Going for the One, I would've been disappointed indeed. And a lot of reviewers remember that  disappointment now. But this record is 22 years old, and in the context of  Yes' catalog is worthwhile on a number of levels. Like Black Sabbath's  Technical Ecstacy and Never Say Die, this is a record which probably should  not have been released; was the result of lackluster writing, lackluster  playing, and really bad production; and features songs which in some  respects are almost charicatures of the band's previous work. Wakeman is at  his most calliope-esque annoying here. Howe is slashing away at his The Les  Paul and his butchered Broadcaster. Anderson is at his most new-age  nauseating. Squire discovered direct-to-board flanging and compression for  his bass, not necessarily to his benefit or ours. Yet at the same time,  there are interesting sounds and even a few memorable hooks here. Some Yes  albums are really worthwhile listening experiences as such. When I first  discovered Yes, The Yes Album, Fragile and CTTE were, themselves, a way to  spend an afternoon. Tormato is far (far far) from that level of  interestingness or even quality, but as a car-changer disc is actually very  listenable. It's interesting to me as a long time fan to hear the boys  struggling to pull off a decent album and failing. With the thin, very dry  production, the album (even remastered) has an almost demo-bootleg feel to  it. And think about it. If this material were only available as a boot,  half the people whining about it as a CD would be paying $50 to own a  copy. As unreleased demos you'd find this fascinating; as an official album  you find it an abomination. Relax. There's good Yes music here, just not  essential Yes music. And as for the cover, I do think Dean's work is part  of the Yes essence, but I also am a huge fan of Storm Thorgerson and  Hipgnosis. I like the cover a lot, including the BOC-esque band photo in  leather jackets and ski glasses.
0064407667|5.0|What a book!  Snicket is amazing.  I cannot believe the bad reviews that this book has been given by other readers.  Obviously they are not capable of handling sarcastic humor.  IT IS FUNNY!  If you go into this book  expecting it to be a typical funny book, be prepared for something  different.  It is dismal and unhappy and because of the way Snicket deals  with the situations, very, very funny.  All four books are at the top of my  recommended reading list (I am a children's librarian).  Enjoy, and keep  waiting for the 5th volume to come out!
B000002KB8|4.0|WITHOUT THIS HEAVY METAL ALBUM IT IS HARD TO TELL HOW HEAVY METAL WOULD BE TODAY OR IF IT EVEN WOULD EXIST. NOT ONLY IS IT THE FIRST OF BLACK SABBATH'S 6 CLASSIC ALBUMS WITH OZZY, IT IS THE FIRST OF HEAVY METAL. IT  WASNT LED ZEPPELIN OR DEEP PURPLE THAT STARTED HEAVY METAL IT WAS SABBATH.  AS FOR THE ALBUM, IT STARTS OUT GREAT WITH 5 SOLID TRACKS( BALCK SABBATH,  WIZARD, BEHIND THE WALL OF SLEEP, NIB, AND WICKED WORLD) BUT THE LAST ONE  LOSES STEAM. MAYBE IF IT WASNT FOR THE  BEAUTIFUL COVER ILLUSTRATION I  WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 3 AND ONE HALF STARS
0140185232|5.0|In our relativistic age it is becoming increasingly hard to find a faith/religion. Society is destroying tradition and has yet to offer a suitable replacement. In The Razor's Edge Larry Darrell is a man seeking a  practical way of living. Unable to devote himself to a particular philosopy  or religion he continually seeks. The Razor's Edge is that tale.<br />After  reading I was amazed at the reflection I saw between Larry, myself, and my  friends. Larry is trying to accomplish what all of us are trying to  accomplish. Call it what you want, peace of mind, religion, personal  philosophy, we are all searching, trying to live life right. Recommended.

B000000WF0|5.0|Scanning through the track list of this gorgeous album reels in memories of lush rock and roll music that is reflective, transcendent and bountifully melodic, with confessional lyrics that speak of starting anew after living through a sordid past. Well, not all the lyrics are like that. \\"Come On\\" is a rollicking, high-energy tune that seems to encourage a debauched night out, while \\"Bittersweet Symphony,\\" \\"The Rolling People\\" and \\"Catching the Butterfly\\" just seem resigned to what we're handed here on Earth. But \\"The Drugs Don't Work,\\" \\"Space and Time,\\" \\"Lucky Man\\" and a few other tunes from \\"Urban Hymns\\" indicate a singer looking for a new direction in life. Perhaps it's not all that surprising The Verve called it quits after releasing this CD.<br /><br />Many used to wonder if all the songs on \\"Urban Hymns\\" were as top-notch as \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony.\\" The answer is yes, though with its sweetly stirring violin section (originally performed by The Andrew Oldham Orchestra from an old Rolling Stones album), \\"Bittersweet\\" might qualify as the most memorable single from the 1990s, and is certainly hard to top. (At the time, singer Richard Ashcroft called \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" the best Rolling Stones song in 20 years, since Mick Jagger and Keith Richards laughably received the credit for writing it, due to the Oldham Orchestra violin within the song.)<br /><br />Even the more tame tunes on \\"Urban Hymns\\" have a larger-than-life presence, due to a melancholy, echoed chorus that's repeated in an Oasis-like fashion, and meaningful lyrics that tug at the heartstrings. More prominent, though, is the loud, psychedelic wall-of-sound heard on \\"Space and Time\\" and \\"Weeping Willow\\" (the former song sounding just like a U2-penned gem with Bono on vocals), and the grooving bass line and wah-wah guitar sound by Nick McCabe on \\"The Rolling People.\\" (McCabe, it should be noted, is a formidable, atmospheric guitar player who is deeply missed since The Verve called it quits.)<br /><br />From lazy and hazy rhythmic grooves to over-the-top, distinctive bombast, \\"Urban Hymns\\" is beautiful from start to finish, and each song has something to say, both lyrically and through an arsenal of amazingly layered sonic creations. Sure, some of this music is a bit of a downer, but listen to the poignant \\"Lucky Man\\" sometime and see if you don't view your own little world in a more positive light.ythmic grooves to over-the-top, distinctive bombast, \\"Urban Hymns\\" is beautiful from start to finish, and each song has something to say, both lyrically and through an arsenal of amazingly layered sonic creations.

B000002UBU|5.0|Amazon.com is selling this CD for a price far below its value!  McLean's most famous song (for which this CD is titled) is not the only great music on this CD.  After one time through the CD, the listener will be captured  by the beauty of the lyrics of Vincent, the sentimental feel of Winterwood,  and the stirring eeriness of Empty Chairs and Babylon.  McLean is at his  best on this Cd!
B000003RCY|5.0|A friend introduced me to Rammstein.  He played Du Hast for me, which I found to be a great song, so he copied me a tape of the album 'Sehnsucht'.  I gave it a listen and thought it was pretty good, but wasn't too fond of  Till's growling (back then I wasn't used to odd singing styles, that's  probably why), but it grew on me; I now realize that his vocals fit perfect  with the music.  So one fine day at Hastings I decided to give them a  chance and buy a CD of theirs.  I almost got Sehnsucht (which I still have  yet to get on CD) but I decided on the last minute to get Herzeleid, their  first album, since I already had Sehnsucht on tape.  I took it to school  the next day and listened to it between classes, and it was so good!  I  found it a lot different than 'Sehnsucht': less keyboardy-techno stuff,  tighter, heavier guitar playing, and much fatter bass-lines - check out the  bass playing in Das Alte Leid!  Then compare it to the bass interludes in  the title track from Sehnsucht and Du Hast- WEAK!   No offense to the  songs- they're great- I just think some of the songs would sound better if  they crank the bass up a few notches.  Let's take a look at the songs:  Wollt Ihr Das Bett In Flammen Sehen- nice horror song, I like the screaming  after each line.  Cool, eerie keyboards and thumping drums. Der Meister-  always enjoy a good speedy song, this is definately one. Weisses Fleisch-  this is, in my opinion, Rammstein's nastiest song lyrically (by the way,  you can find English translations of Rammstein's lyrics around the net.   They're confusing, and  scary! ).  But I don't mind that, it's got a cool  tune which makes it a good song. Asche Zu Asche- cool keyboards.  I love  the guitar riff! Seemann- the best mellow, ballad-type songs usually come  from heavy metal bands.  This song proves that. Du Riechst So Gut- cool  riffs and everything, but severely lacking in bass. Das Alte Lied- I like  the backing vocals and the keyboard melodies in this song. Heirete Mich-  creepy. Herzeleid- very fun.  My favorite song on the album.   Laichzeit-  my favorite keyboard performance by Rammstein (on this album, at least).  Rammstein- a nice, simple closing tune. Well, there you have it.  Bottom  line: buy it.
B000002U84|5.0|Some of these songs I hadn't heard since I was 14 (pre-CD days for me)...but amazingly enough still remembered ALL the lyrics! These songs are classic...They had their own sound and still do...but the songs on this  album I believe are by far their best...its almost if they have gotten  better with age...not your typical 80's sounding music...they were  definitely in a class all their own back then....listening to these songs  now is like discovering the fab 5 all over again &amp; Simon's voice is  heaven!
0316777722|4.0|I took this book with me on a plane trip and found myself laughing out loud!  I hope the people next to me didn't think I was crazy.  A couple of chapters fell flat with a dull &quot;thud&quot;, but the majority of the  book was quite entertaining.  I was amused by how he is able to rank on the  French culture without coming off as an entirely arrogant American.   Remembering how I felt in Germany having studied the language only two  years, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; really hit home.  David Sedaris  is able to describe situations we can all relate to, and then put is own  unique twist on them.  I'm now inspired to read &quot;Holidays on  Ice&quot;.
044651652X|1.0|I read this book because I was tired of seeing it all over the place and assumed that there was something there.  I closed it 2 hours later, having finished it in that amount of time, wondering how many poor trees had to  die to print this soap opera.  Children find out that their mother had an  extra-marital affair on their father while they were at a country fair,  having left her behind to pick up a wandering photojournalist and they find  the romance worthy of celebrating?  Yeah!  That is reality for you. I am  sure there are loads of adult children hoping they found out that their  mother was living a lie their entire lives!<br />Sorry, but I still regret  wasting the time on this book.  And I won't see the movie, even on video,  because I have already wasted enough time on this sentimental fantasy.  I  would rather read a Harlequin novel.  At least then I would have been  forewarned and without excuse for wasting my time.

B000002U8G|5.0|This album is truly Pink Floyd's breakthrough.They use the same fromula here as they do in Dark Side Of The Moon.The expiremental sound effects are great and Gilmours guitar is as powerful as ever.Plus all 4 members have  big roles in this album, unlike the Wall that is mostly Waters songs.It  also spawned 2 of pink Floyds most popular songs One Of These Days &amp;  the psycedelic space jam Echoes.Plus 2 underatted gems the acoustic/sound  effects oriented Pillow Of Winds and the riff oriented Fearless.San Tropez  &amp; Seamus are both blues oriented songs the band used to perform in the  early days with Barret.All in all this is great Floyd.
B00004TL2N|5.0|Listening to Bruckner, or being an honest &quot;Brucknerian&quot;, is one thing. Commenting on a new interpretation or performance in a manner that is more demonstrative of one's personal musical knowledge rather than  expressive of the work itself, is quite another.<br />The new Boulez  interpretation, as well as the Vienna Philharmonic performance and the  sound enginnering and recording, are absolutely fantastic. Yes, the Haas  version is a little different from the, for my taste, overpopular Nowak  variance. They are both worth listening to, as are most performances by the  Karajans, Barenboims, Walters, etc.    This release is absolutely a MUST in  any Bruckner fan's collection (and there is nothing wrong with owning four,  five or six renditions of the same piece).  Sometimes over-analysing works  of art, especially the kinetic variety like music, borders on  over-analyzing!<br />Buy the disc and play the hell of it, and enjoy!
B000003S5G|4.0|&quot;Moon Safari&quot; is a terrific album, and I would highly reccommend it to anyone who's into electronica. Although I prefer the sad beauty of &quot;The Virgin Suicides,&quot; this is equally good.
6302413931|5.0|Because I will be teaching Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS to a group of advanced seniors in high-school in the spring for the first time, I decided to revisit Coppola's Vietnam version of the story after having reread the  original. Although I did not serve in Vietnam, I was an impressionable  child who remembers vividly the LIFE MAGAZINE Decade-in-Review issue from  1970, flush with images of the war; the six-o'-clock television news  footage of combat; the daily &quot;casualty&quot; count; and all the rest.  (If you lived through the period yourself, you know just how much more  there was.)<br />For me, APOCALYPSE NOW captures brilliantly the mood of the  time of the Vietnam War. It captures the feelings I used to get reading  about Me-Lai or the Tet Offensive, or the feelings from just listening to  friends talk about their brothers' experiences when they returned home. It  reminds me of W.D. Ehrhart's brilliant memoir VIETNAM-PERKASIE, of Michael  Herr's DISPATCHES, etc. And it truly is faithful to the spirit and  structure of Conrad's river-journey narrative.<br />Students today are several  steps removed from the horror which is war. APOCALYPSE NOW preserves the  spirit of that horror. We must not forget; we must not repeat.
B00004TL21|5.0|Already we have the \\"Album of the Year\\" in White Pony. The Deftones live up to expectations and deliver a solid collection of emotional and jaw-dropping masterpieces. Every track hits the marks without a single  filler track, which is difficult to achieve in today's music when every new  album tries to fill up the 74 minutes allocated on the CD. <br />Opener  Fieticeira hits the ground running with Chino in fine vocal form on this  old style Deftones song. Cool rhythms and heavy-soft dynamics make it  instantly recognisable. Digital Bath, which must become a single in the  future, has Chino hitting the high notes. The potential live favourite  Elite is 100% heavy that uses a vocoder giving a demonic robot effect. It  is the least dynamic track on the album that is also the heaviest song the  band has ever recorded. RX Queen is the most melodic and futurist track on  offer with a crazy drum loop and dirty guitar line. Scott Weiland of STP  helped with the vocals and harmonies. Street Carp is classic Deftones with  an instant riff. It sounds like the lyrics are being made up on the spot.  Teenager will draw some raised eyebrows as it is mostly acoustic with Pink  Floyd-y keyboards. Teenager was originally a Sleep side-project song that  was too good to hide away. Knife Party creates images of violence and is  one of the album's many highlights. Korea was the first song written for  the record, which is clear, as the typical Deftones formula is given a  though workout - a real grower. Passenger is the one with Tool's Keenan  about a car journey. The chorus is probably the best on the record and the  longest. Change is the first single and rightly so as it is also the best  track on White Pony. It is the closest the band have come to recapturing  the magic of Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away). Pink Maggot starts off spacey  and slow with just vocals and guitar. It ends up a triumphant anthem about  being the coolest kid in school. Bonus track The Boys Republic continues  the tradition being just as strong as the album tracks. Worth purchasing  the Limited Edition version for this track alone.  So there you have, an  album you can put on repeat listening and not get bored. White Pony is not  as heavy as previous releases which will put off a few fans - but so what,  it's the songwriting that counts not how loud the guitars go.
B00003Q43A|5.0|The movie is mindless fun, we all know that. But the f/x are awesome, and the extras alone on this DVD are worth the price!

The second disc is chock full of behind-the-scenes features that  rival any DVD I've seen yet! A bargain!
0553275569|5.0|The Right Stuff is a facinating and accurate depiction of the saga of the Mercury astronauts.  Tom Wolfe really does a wonderful job of making both an interesting factual presentation of history as well as a colorful  portrayal of the lives of those directly involved.  The stress on the wives  of the pilots for example gives one the untainted look at these incredible  ladies composure and character that is seldon captured in other historical  novels.  The astronauts and pilots themselves who were regarded as more  than human by the press of the period, are also portrayed very artfully in  this often candid expose' on their often carefree regard for the dangerous  jobs they constantly undertook.  These men and women truly had the  `Right  Stuff' at a very unpredictable period in US history: the dawn of the space  race.  High pressure situations continually kept all those involved on  constant edge.  This book carries you from the testing flight testing years  at Edwards airforce base where Yeager is the king, through the Sputnik  challenge and the American failed rocket testing early on, and finally  arriving at the eventual successful space flights themselves.  Throughout  the book is the ongoing weave of eager and relentless reporters, a  clamoring nation of people demanding immediate success, as well as the  political  pressure through three presidential administrations all piled on  the shoulders of those connected with the program.  The pressure cooker  builds as the story progresses, and the explosion of success takes everyone  involved by surprise including the astronauts themselves.  This is an  incredibly unique period in US history depicting the first astronauts who  were idolized in a time when the nation truly needed heroes for its own  personal pride.  These men restored patriotism at a time when the feeling  was considered lost.  Additionally Wolfe covers the early years of the  space programs development, including the Air Forces success with the X-15project which was over-shadowed by the popularity of the Mercury program.  The Mercury program's success sparked the later Apollo and Gemini programs  almost immediately after the first flight with Alan Shepard.  The sudden  success of the NASA space program created a silent upheaval in the national  brotherhood of pilots that is brilliantly detailed by the author giving a a  full picture to the reader.  One really gets the full practical viewpoint  and daredevil gallantry of the test pilots in this book that is seldom  touched elsewhere.  In addition to that the author describes the beginning  of the space program and the early positioning of power within that reveals  an almost complete upheaval at times by its early architects (scientists,  engineers, pilots, and all) and finally settling into a sensable orderly  structure in the later years. This book truly sheds light on the early  years of the NASA space program and gives one the candid look behind all  the fanfare showing what really was happening outside of the public eye.  Tom Wolfe completes a very tasteful coverage of the lives of the people  involved and the evolution of the exploration of the new frontier with this  exciting work. I found the later movie that followed the book to be very  much in keeping, however there are many details that are left out of the  movie that are covered in the book.  This alone makes it a must to read.  parts of the story that were unable to make it to the big screen was the  flight of Wally Shirra and Scott Carpenter.  These two flights alone had a  great deal to do with setting the future direction of the space program.  This is one you will enjoy as it will capture you interest from the  beginning and leave you with a sense of national pride at the bravery and  true pioneer spirit of all the people involved.  You will be amazed as I  was at the out-pouring of affection these men generated on America during  this period.  A stunning portrayal of a unique period in American history.  All in all a great book to read and enjoy.  I am very grateful to Tom Wolfe  for having written such a novel, as this was a story that needed to be  told.
B00004TL21|3.0|`Inconsistent' and `lackluster' are the first words that come to mind when I think of `White Pony'.  It's ironic as well because it's STILL worthy of 3 stars, maybe 3 and a 1/2 to push it. Finally, FINALLY after a lot of  anticipation the Deftones have made their 3rd release.  Chino and company  have taken different steps for this album though.  Steps for change.  With  their new production, the band has ventured quite far from their aggro',  rapcore/metal roots to bring us a more, commercial, melodic sound that is  laced with many techno-electronic effects with intentions of bringing a  more diverse emotional-trance experience.  Now there's absolutely nothing  wrong with change, especially since it's easily noticeable that the  Deftones put a lot of effort into making this change a good one.  Expanding  their wings call also be condoned since the rapcore/metal sound has flooded  the market like hurricane, and will probably die quicker than `Caverichi'  jeans, 80's hair, and women's platform- heel sneakers. However, effort and  change doesn't always encompass excellence.  And the group itself, always  being a batch of decent performers they are, fell short of it with the  latest release.  It's not that the album is bad or anything, it's just  leaves much to be desired compared to the Deftones level of ability.  <br />To  sum up `White Pony' as a whole, aside from `Feiticeira,' `Digital Bath,'  `Knife Prty' (that's the way it's spelt on my CD cover, wondering if it's a  Typo) and `Change,' there's nothing from the album that easily stands out.   As mentioned before, some songs are better than others. `Feiticeira' is a  good opener, well constructed, Chino making use of his awesome vocal  talent, but just a tad lacking in the lyrical department. `Digital Bath' is  even better, a mood swing inducing melody full of the emotion that made the  `Tones so popular.  With 2 opening ballads like that, anyone would think  that the album would get better from there.  And it nearly does with  `Elite', which `bleeds' of the Deftones of old but falls away from interest  with its redundancy.  From this point, is where the album begins to wane a  slightly.  `Teenager' is a slower ballad, with nothing special about it  aside from the techno effects.  Chino doesn't add anything to the track  either, instead of using his vocal ability to draw any emotion out of the  music, he just comes of as whispering and mumbling the entire way through.   `Street Carp' and `Rx Queen' are about the same, certainly not ballads -  but lacking in the emotion that I'm used to getting from the `Tones.   Shockingly, `Passenger' is much like the songs just mentioned.  How could  you go wrong with the explosive voice of Maynard James Keenan howling on  one of your tracks? It's sad, because `Passenger' isn't as good as it  should be.  The song's difficult to get into do to the fact that it flip  flops in tone and structure constantly making it come off as disjointed  accept for the near mid part where Keenan cries out \\"I'm your Passenger\\".   For the most part though, it's sure a thing that the group doesn't need  Chino to scream, grunt, and holler like he did on the album's predecessors.   You don't need that to emphasize emotion or to get your point across.    But mumbling, whispering, and breaking out into pointless screams doesn't  bring anything exceptional to `White Pony' either.<br />Aside from the  disappointment in Chino's vocals, the album's biggest let down are the  lyrics.  \\"The machine takes pictures of us\\"?  In many of the tunes, aside  from this line from `Feiticeira' (And `Korea' is even worse), the words are  just pointless, lacking substance, and much them make little sense, if any  at all.  They aren't all mediocre though, the album does have some saving  graces like `Change' and especially in `Knife Prty', which are both all  around great tunes worthy of the Deftone's name and hype.          The last  thing that should be mentioned is the musicians' instrument work. It's last  because it's the most forgettable.  The guitar and drum work is good, even  with it being as toned down as it is from their previous work, but aside  from new techno effects, the showmanship brings nothing innovative to that  ever so hard to set `table` that we all know as `originality'.  In  conclusion, with all this considered, this 3rd installment by the Deftone's  is NOT a bad effort by any means.  An underachievement - yes.  Overrated  band - no. What can be concluded about the `White Pony' record is an  excellent idea for a band venturing into something new.  It's just poorly  executed.  To sum up `White Pony' in just two words, call it `baked beans'.   Mom puts them on your plate, and you just eat `em.  You don't like `em,  love `em, or hate `em. They are just there.  You just eat them and don't  think anything of `em.  It's almost as if they say `ignore me'.  You just  eat `em.

B000002AH7|4.0|This music is the best example of classical music meets jazz. The music is played with great subtle power. There is deep feeling in most every track. My biggest complaint however is the bass is extremly low in the mix, my 120  watt B&amp;W subwoofer is the only thing that saves this terrible problem.  Why do so many old jazz albums suffer from such problems. Some people  believe that the bass is the most important part of the rhythmn section,   why do such an injustice? The music is so good it should get 5 stars but  with the reording being sub-par, I do not see it. If you have a subwoofer  turn the bass up and discover the real way to hear this materpiece.
0679721037|3.0|John Hersey has written a powerful novel of the Hiroshima bombing and its aftermath. To show the horror of nuclear holocaust through the eyes of the survivors is the best way to convey it. The 6 survivors documented in this  book where extraordinary people who went on to do something with their  lives instead of being bitter. The story that was the most inspiring was  Dr.Fujii and how he helped others. Then after the war, he enjoyed life to  the fullest and helped many foreigners as well. The sad thing was that even  though they had nothing to do with what happened to them , the survivors  were shunned even by their own people for being &quot;hibakusha&quot;. To  know what that is, you have to read the book. So I encourage whoever sees  this review to read the book.

I have the audio version read by Bryson and this adds the extra dimension of his  witty personality.  This guy would be a fun to travel companion.  Highly  recommended!

B00000J2KX|5.0|This movie is my favourite movie ever, closely followed by Monty Pythons meaning of life. It is so amazingly eerie and haunting, with some truly terrifying scenes. The music adds to the haunting effect it gives. It keeps  you awake for days Nicholson and Duvall are very good, with nicholson's  performance being a classic of all time. Lloys is also very good for an  actor of his age. (This is his only movie) I wont tell you the storyline as  to wreck it for you if you have not already seen it. If you have read the  book it is only loosely based on the book but believe me it does not  detract from the movie.<br />Hope this helps (rent it or buy it)<br />A  Classic<br />Thanx

6305905401|5.0|Wow, it's great to finally see some positive reviews. I was afraid that my Johnny Depp fans and compatriots were the only people that really adored this movie.<br />I saw a preview for The Ninth Gate way back in July '98 and I  was entranced then. I saw it the day it opened and the week after as well.  I was shocked to see how many people were confused, disappointed, or both.  I understood it just fine and I was completely enthralled with Roman  Polanski's excellent use of cinematography, landscape, fine acting talent,  and a great screenplay. This movie, combined with Sleepy Hollow really have  turned me onto Johnny Depp's amazing talent.<br />It's still rather surprising  to me that, as a fairly staunch non-denominational Christian at a fairly  young age, I am so entertained by a movie about conjuring up Satan and  laden with a bit of sexual content and a tad of swearing but I just can't  help it. The mood is just so appealing. I reccomend renting this movie just  for the chilling introduction and opening credits. Combined with Wojciech  Kilar's goosebump-conjuring score, Johnny Depp and Frank Langella's amazing  performances, and Polanski at his best, it all turns out to be a  fascinatingly frightening.<br />&quot;I think within the first three minutes  of a Polanski film, you feel some kind of uneasiness, a sense of  instability in the center of your body. He's the king of that...I like  [Dean Corso] because in the beginning when you really dislike him, he's  bad. But when you grow to like him at the end, he's in fact worse.&quot;  --Johnny Depp in Wicked magazine, Spring 2000

B000002LMK|5.0|I don't think there could have been a more apt title for this CD.  This CD was my introduction to the world of Neil Young.<br />I had probably heard heart of Gold on the radio, but it hadn't registered.  Country Home was the  first of his tracks that I listened to.  I was really stoked, I had some  inkling that he was a well known guitar player, but I was not prepared for  this.  He proceeded to play both melodically and insanely - at once.   Furthermore, he seemed to have little over concern about whether or not he  sung a dud note.  What a man.  What guts it takes to do that.<br />The songs  here are really cool, slightly country-ish, but with none of that boring  sheen.  The CD powers through from track one, barely resting. It only  slightly drops the pace for days that used to be (which it has been noted  sounds suspicously similar to Dylans/Byrds My Back Pages).<br />The only  spoiler I feel is track ten Mother Earth (natural anthem) nice sentiment  really, and very timely as it would have come out just as the scare about  the ozone layer reached its height.  However, the song sounds almost as  corny as a real national anthem (i do hate them...all of them...sorry  patriots).<br />There are many special moments on this CD.  My very favorite  track is Love and only Love  - how does a song with such a cliched title  work so well?  This song draws out to around 10 minutes, lots of nasty  guitar solos.  <br />On a personal notes, I had played guitar for about two or  three years when a came upon this CD.  It completely altered the way I  approach guitar playing, it showed me that there need be no rules and that  the slickest sounds don't have to be the best.  Neil's approach is much  more primal...and FUN.<br />This is a CD to hear LOUD.  It's beauty is its  ugliness.  I really think that this CD keeps alive the rock'n'roll  tradition better than any CD i've heard in the last decade...big statement?   Maybe, maybe not...
B00004U8H4|5.0|The length of a theatrical run does not dictate the greatness of a movie. Just look at such high-quality entertainment goodies like Disney's  &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, or the lamentable &quot;Pokemon&quot; features. These  have been in theatres for Ages and, creatively speaking, leave much to be  desired. I can recall that in my area &quot;American Psycho&quot; was in  theatres for less than two months: I wouldn't expect otherwise because of  the subject matter. I personally saw it three times in theatres, and was  hoping to see it more but it left. On one of these occasions, there were  ten other people with me: a couple in their thirties, two ladies in their  seventies, and a couple in the back in their late forties. I was the only  one laughing. When you're dealing with controversial subject matter, it is  to be expected that the Masses (who support films ranging from the  delightful musings of Mary-Kate &amp; Ashley Olson to the melodramatic  heavy-handedness of &quot;Titanic&quot;) neither appreciate nor enjoy such  non-mainstream fare. For enthusiasts for the book, one cannot expect that  it be too directly translated, otherwise, like the little known  &quot;Castle Freak&quot;, it would have to go direct to video, if that. To  those who think that you need to have read the book to understand it, maybe  if you only have half a brain, than yes. I saw it without having even seen  a trailer (much less reading the book) and saw it for what it was: a  chronicalling of the turbulent times of a fed-up man's life. Having read  the book, I can appreciate the subtle combinations of the pontifications on  Bad '80s albums with memorable scenes like Jared Leto getting axed to death  (with &quot;Hip to be Square&quot; playing in the background). At its  weakest, it is an inconsequential Fun movie, at its best, it really has  something to say about the identity of the modern successful man.

B00000JCB2|4.0|I thought this cd was an impovement over their first cd. The first cd is too repetative. This one has a lot of different kinds of things on it. There is the rap song &quot;N2Gether Now&quot; with Method Man. And there  are some pretty heavy songs like &quot;Nookie&quot; and &quot;Break  Stuff&quot;. &quot;Nobody Like You&quot; is a little different but it's  still a cool song with KoRn's Jon Davis and Stone Temple Pilot's Scott  Weiland. &quot;No Sex&quot; is a slower, more mellow song that features  Aaron Lewis of StainD. And then there is the Tool sounding &quot;Don't Go  Off Wondering&quot; which is one of the best songs on the cd. Buy this if  you like Limp Bizkit, KoRn, STP, or Kid Rock

078324228X|4.0|The most startling revelation about Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane' is that this true-life account of middleweight champion Ruben `Hurricane' Carter turns out to be more about the glories of writing than of boxing. In  fact, almost no time at all in the film is dedicated to chronicling the  details of Carter's fighting career but rather to the attempts made by him  and others on his behalf to prove his innocence in a murder case that  resulted in his serving a nearly 20-year long prison sentence.<br />The  sympathies of the filmmakers clearly lie with Carter, although a number of  people have, since the release of the film, challenged some of the film's  reliability and veracity. As one completely unacquainted with the facts of  the case as they initially played themselves out, I am certainly in no  position to adjudge the authenticity and accuracy of the film. As a piece  of drama, however, `The Hurricane' generates an impressive amount of  interest in the viewer and even attains emotional greatness in a few  scenes. Because the film is trying to come at the story from so many  different angles, it occasionally feels a bit like a patchwork - part  boxing film, part prison drama, part investigative thriller, part  inspirational feel-good drama - rather than a completely unified work of  art. And, understandably, the film is more successful in some of those  areas than in others.<br />The first half of the film is pretty standard issue  stuff. We get, perhaps, a somewhat overly sketchy portrayal of the events  in Carter's life before the fateful night in Paterson, NJ when he found  himself the prime suspect at a murder scene. We see Carter as an 11-year  old boy getting in trouble with the law for defending himself against a  pedophile who turns out to be a well-respected and highly placed figure in  the local community. This incident introduces him to the Paterson sergeant  (Dan Hedaya) who plays the Javert to Carter's Jean Valjean, dedicating his  life to seeing that Carter never lives his life outside prison, hounding  him out of a misguided sense of self-righteous zeal - an obsession  aggravated by the galling fact that Carter has since gone on to achieve  international notoriety in the ring. As in many of the early sections of  the film, the writers Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon fail to portray the  incidents in Carter's life in a well-rounded, totally believable way. We  find it hard to understand just why this one black child - among a vast  number in Paterson one presumes - would fire up this sergeant's passion so  intensely. We also are rushed along through Carter's early stints in  prison, his time in the military, his rise to fame in the boxing world,  sometimes with little more than voice-over excerpts from Carter's novel to  inform us of how much he has learned and changed from his experiences. The  script is so jumpy at times that we never feel we get to know much about  the young Carter at all.<br />Luckily for us, this is not all there is to `The  Hurricane.' The writers and director wisely enlarge the canvas of their  story to include the teenager, Lesra Martin, whose contact it was with  Carter, languishing almost forgotten in prison, that ultimately set the  wheels of justice rolling that would lead to Carter's eventual release. And  herein lies the real emotional core of the story. Lesra, a near-illiterate  inner city boy from Brooklyn, living with some benevolent white liberals in  Canada, purchases an old copy of the autobiographical best-selling novel  Carter wrote in prison - the first book Lesra has ever read - and becomes  so caught up in the similarities to his own life pouring off the pages that  he decides to write to Carter in prison. A warm relationship develops  between the aging convict and the budding youngster which eventually leads  to Lesra's introducing Carter to his mentors who then take up the cause of  getting Carter's case overturned. The highlight of the film is clearly the  mesmerizing, emotionally riveting first encounter between Lesra and Carter;  we sit spellbound as the two hurting individuals grope tentatively towards  one another, each seeking that connection with (and recognition from) the  other on the common ground of their parallel life experiences that they  need so desperately. As the two discuss the liberating effect their writing  has on both of them, the film becomes a glorious paean to the power and  might of the written word. It is a truly unforgettable  scene.<br />Unfortunately, the film only achieves that gripping emotional  power a few times afterwards and in each occasion it is the connection  between Lesra and Carter that brings it about. The three Canadian activists  who take on the case for Carter's innocence remain underdeveloped as  characters. We wonder how they can afford to leave their jobs in Canada and  dedicate themselves exclusively to Carter's cause. And why are they always  together? Do they have any other relationships in their lives or have they  taken a vow of celibacy to go along with their social crusading? Their  successful attempts to unravel the mystery of what really happened on that  night in 1966 are interesting on the level of historicity but these  sequences weaken the emotional drama at the film's core. Since we do not  get to know these characters as fully fleshed-out human beings, we watch  these scenes with an attitude of detached disinterest rather than intense  emotional involvement Perhaps, the story of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter is too  diverse a one to be successfully encapsulated even in a film that runs an  impressive 146 minutes.<br />I realize, of course, that I have not yet  mentioned Denzel Washington's impressive performance as Carter. He  literally holds the film together since there is virtually no scene in  which he is not present. This tour-de-force role allows him to run the  emotional gambit from sullen rage and explosive fury to warmhearted  tenderness and stoic idealism (and how many 40-something actors could still  convincingly portray a man in his early '20's)? Equally impressive, though,  is young Vicellous Reon Shannon's work as the disadvantaged but ever  idealistic Lesra. Together these two extraordinary actors take `The  Hurricane' to impressive emotional heights. This is their film all the way  and it undoubtedly does `The Hurricane' himself proud.smerizing, emotionally riveting first encounter between Lesra and Carter;  we sit spellbound as the two hurting individuals grope tentatively towards  one another, each seeking that connection with (and recognition from) the  other on the common ground of their parallel life experiences that they  need so desperately.

0385493622|4.0|Since mathematics books cannot presume that the general audience knows much about mathematics, this author, to his credit, gives all of the prehistory and the history of Fermat's problem before describing the historic proof by Andrew Wiles.<br />Unavoidably, however, these histories are  infected by a certain bias in favor of narrating the history of mathematics  as the history of Great Men.<br />For this reason, Singh presents Pythagoras  as a demigod...despite accounts of barbaric behavior by  Pythagoras.<br />What's missing is the account of mathematics written by a  French mathematical collective of the 1960s, Bourbaki.  Bourbaki narrated a  history of mathematics which acknowledges that in a sense Pythagoras,  Euclid, and the other Great Mathematicians built not only on their named  predecessors but also on what the Greeks might call &quot;praxis&quot;:  everyday life in which anonymous people created mathematics in order to  solve problems.<br />Because of this, Singh essentially indoctrinates the  reader into a world view that looks down on practice and is overly  enchanted by what happens at centers of mathematical research...of which  Princeton is one.<br />To his enormous credit, Singh does show that the very  structure of mathematics means that contributions from the margins, from  the Japanese work on which Wiles based his proof to Indian mathematician  Ramanujan's work, are essential to progress.<br />However, the narration is of  a one-way flow.  Babylonian and Sumerian bookkeepers and farmers evolved  concepts of number and measure in what nowadays would be called &quot;just  in time&quot; fashion.  They did not evolve zero or negative numbers  probably because their social organization was static enough to avoid the  need for credit (this is speculation.)  Zero and negative entered European  mathematics, it appears from most narratives, at the moment when the  increasing economic impact of voyages of discovery (such as that of  Columbus) required more sophisticated mechanisms of credit...including  bankruptcy and carrying negative balances.<br />This work is taken by  mathematicians at the summit.  Descartes did not invent negative numbers:  he showed instead where they could be modeled.<br />What is missing is a  reverse flow.  Singh ends with Wiles' real accomplishment.  What troubles  me is that the accomplishment is really the end of a story.  Not only of  amateur mathematicians laboring to solve the problem in isolation but also  of people, such as the young Andrew Wiles himself, who are inspired to  enter mathematics by the very idea of an unsolved problem, which to the  young mathematical mind is similar to the unexplored areas of maps.<br />We  can only admire such passionate purity as Wiles'.  But we need also work in  applied mathematics and similar passion and imagination in the teaching of  mathematics.  <br />The very way in which Singh's proof was announced by the  media including the New York Times was infected with postmodern American  end-of-history triumphalism, a mood which simply ignores growing  mathematical illiteracy (along with poverty and disease) and which sharply  separates the teaching and the application of mathematics from pure  math.<br />For example, we have no socially accepted way of reviewing computer  programs used by government and by industry for transparency and for  correctness whereas pure mathematics has the review process for its papers.   This is a growing problem if we accept Harvard law professor Lawrence  Lessig's contention that &quot;the code is the law.&quot;  <br />The sharp  distinction between pure and applied mathematics, reinforced by the Dead  White Male narrative of the history of mathematics, creates, in my view,  math anxiety which is the reason for massive failure in math and for poor  implementation of software.<br />Without at all discounting Wiles' achievement  or Singh's clear exposition of a very advanced part of mathematics, we can  also point out a world view which creates both Fine Hall (Princeton's math  department) and math anxiety.  I teach math and programming, and what fires  the gifted student is not triumphalist news of solved problems: this  narrative is hegemonic.  What fires the gifted student are books (even if  out of date, and published by Dover) with uncharted waters.<br />So many  mathematical geniuses start their careers with fascination with huge  numbers or with Quixotic quests to square the circle that we need to  emphasize, in all the hoopla, that in mathematical terms, there probably is  a nondenumerable number of unsolved problems remaining.  But the  triumphalist narrative is more like Arthur C. Clarke's short story The Nine  Billion Names of God, and self-infects with a message to the tyro that he  or she was born too late, and should hie on down to the technical institute  to learn mere programming.<br />Ordinary people cannot do pure mathematics and  most contemporary mathematicians get their ideas endogenously...from other  people in the field.  We've evolved beyond Euclid getting inspiration and  ideas from a farmer plowing a field.  But I look in vain in Singh for any  mention of possible application to social problems (I don't look for  application to defense.)  This aporia in Singh is part of the overall  presentation of solved problems at the summit, which, for an unknown  reason, allow us to ignore the problems of everyday life.<br />The question,  of course, is whether my view, that the skills of the pure mathematician  have any application whatsoever to the problems of society, is correct.  In  the latter days of Bertrand Russell, the author of Principia Mathematica  (having essentially blown it if either David Hilbert's formalism or  intuitionism are correct) called on mathematicians to focus on the real  possibility of nuclear war, but today the fashion of laissez-faire excludes  anything resembling the procedures of mathematics, pure OR applied, from  the solution ofsocial problems.<br />The trouble with this fashionable view  is that even if we cannot solve the riddle of justice with an equation, the  fashionable view throws the baby out with the bathwater, for missing in  discussion of social problems are not only mathematical methods other than  simple, and usually wrong, addition and subtraction of large sums for  defense and laughably small sums for human needs: also missing is the very  idea of a committment to truth.  There is in other words a high wall  between Wiles' absolute committment not only to truth but to line by line  verification, and the words and behavior of people educated in  non-mathematical subjects at Yale and at Princeton.  The  self-deconstructing words of Yalie George Dubya Bush come to mind.<br />We're  teaching only the maths guys the idea of a committment to truth (the  committment which caused Gottlob Frege to so movingly recant his life's  work in the logical foundations of arithmetic.)  Despite the real worth of  postmodern theory, properly understood, we're teaching the non-maths guys  and gals deconstructive nonsense which exhibits an ideological lack of any  committment to truth, such as a Politically Correct article I saw recently  which called the GI Bill &quot;racist.&quot;  Fortunately, men like George  Dubya tend nowadays to blow off this nonsense with intense partying but its  very existence replicates in them an opposing lack of a committment to  truth, the example having been set. <br />We live in a society in which  despite the real parallels between computer programming and mathematical  proof, American computer programmers are (according to a 1994 essay by  computer scientist PJ Plauger) almost childishly sullen when their work  (which has far more impact on everyday life than Fermat) is subject to peer  review.  American programmers behave like the way Pierre de Fermat behaved,  treating knowledge as a trade secret and taking a regressive pleasure in  creating confusion.  The result is a massive shift towards importing  programmers from India, modern-day Ramanujans who in my experience are real  gentlemen and who have the humility exhibited also by Andrew  Wiles.<br />There's a plaint in GH Hardy's A MATHEMATICIAN'S APOLOGY that (at  his 1930s Cambridge) the best and the brightest (&quot;Cambridge  Apostles&quot; like John Maynard Keyes and Anthony Blunt) did not regard  mathematicians as public intellectuals, like them.  Modern mathematicians  still feel this resentment at times.  They would do well to ponder that one  mark of the public intellectual is concern for the public good and the ways  in which one's work might enhance that good.  Pure mathematicians do, in my  view, ask to be ghettoized precisely by their desire to work in such thin,  clear air.  <br />But owing to triumphalist discourse which (in the darkest  possible view) presents the solution of Fermat as subconcious *ersatz* for  the solution of social problems, real mathematicians who enter applied  mathematics seem to be the inferior term in a binary opposition.
B00003CWRX|4.0|Corporate whistle blowing makes for ideal storytelling material, coming fully equipped, as it does, with many of the raw elements of great drama. For who can resist the spectacle of an Everyman underdog, driven by a  courageous sense of personal righteousness and love of humanity, laying his  integrity, his livelihood, often even his life itself on the line in the  pursuit of truth and justice?<br />Based on real life events, in which  &quot;60 Minutes&quot; compromised its journalistic integrity by buckling  under to pressure from the tobacco industry not to run an interview with a  whistle blower, Michael Mann's &quot;The Insider&quot; provides a solid,  often gripping and always interesting drama that works on several levels  simultaneously: as an expose of the shocking moral turpitude occurring at  the upper levels of many of our nation's corporate structures, as a view of  the life-and-death power struggle that takes place in a legal system awash  in corruption and mind-boggling complexity, and as an incisive examination  of two men's epic struggle with morality and ethics and the exigencies of  doing the right thing in a world where doing the wrong is often both easier  and more handsomely rewarded.<br />Russell Crowe stars as former tobacco  executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, who, upon being fired for no accountable  reason by his company, agrees to tape an interview for &quot;60  Minutes&quot; on which he plans to expose the tobacco industry's secret  practice of enhancing the nicotine-based addiction levels in cigarettes. Al  Pacino plays &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer Lowell Bergman, who befriends  Wigand and talks him into granting the interview. As `60 Minutes' itself  succumbs to the pressure of the corporate entity, the film becomes,  essentially, a study of TWO whistle blowers, for Bergman, every bit as much  as Wigand, must question his commitment to the company he has so long  served and admired. While the two cope with their ever increasing moral  dilemmas, the real life drama plays itself out, as Mann casts a scathing  eye on corporate malevolence, judicial malfeasance, and, above all,  journalistic timidity and compromise. Admirably, Mann never takes his focus  off the human drama at the core and he is assisted in that by the first  rate performances of his two lead actors. It is no wonder that Mike Wallace  has denounced the film in no uncertain terms as a libel and a fraud if  there is indeed any truth to be found in his depiction herein. Embodied by  an unctuous Christopher Plummer, the character hardly qualifies as a pillar  of moral courage and rectitude.

One  glaring technical error does, however, stand out. At one point, while two  men are carrying on a telephone conversation, one in Kentucky and one in  Mississippi, we can see clearly that, in one shot it is nightfall and in  the other bright day.

0767819594|2.0|Hailed as the modern day version of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;, &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; failed miserably with audiences and critics alike for the hopes of a sleek, sensual update of the classic original.  This was merely another teen movie, the only difference being that there  are gratuitous sexual references and racy stunts by Sarah Michelle Gellar  and Selma Blair in their infamous screen kiss, tongues and all. Yes, Ms.  Buffy herself is quite a promiscuous deviate as Kathryn Merteuil (think  Marquise de Merteuil, played by Glenn Close in the stunning original) in  this movie, licking her cocaine spoon and gambling with her high-standing  reputation as an irrefutably sound and urbane young lady. Then there's Ryan  Phillippe as the lead male, Sebastian Valmont (John Malkovich's role as the  self-absorbed Vicomte de Valmont), made immediate family of Kathryn by  their parents' marriage. He is a blue-blooded spoiled brat who effortlessly  takes advantage of younger impressionable girls and flicks them to the curb  with nary a regret. He is a charming cad, charting his territory carefully  and fooling everyone with his innocuous and well-mannered guise.<br />  Kathryn's and Sebastian's relationship with each other is not quite close  to platonic, being that their slight sexual attraction to one another gives  the audience the willies. However, they soon make a deal, show their  civility in a firm handshake and begin to conspire like brother and sister.  This is where the premise of the story begins and it starts with the  souring of a doe-eyed ingenue named Cecile Caldwell (de Volanges - Uma  Thurman's naive portrayal), played by underground talent Selma Blair.  Cecile is a gullible youngster whom Sebastian easily seduces and drags on  his invisible chain of habitual deception, only to lose his prospect to  another indecent and illusory connoisseur.<br />  Sebastian's truly immoral  prowess doesn't surface until Kathryn picks his seemingly unobtainable  goal: a young virgin named Annette Hargrove (the equivalent to Michelle  Pfeiffer's Madame de Tourvel). A firm believer in abstinence before  marriage with a nationally published essay to prove it, Annette arrives in  town visiting relatives and rooming in their lush mansion whilst Sebastian  prowls her chambers, working his black magic to rob her of her only virtue.  She proves at first to be resilient and opposing to his magnetic appeal,  but like all silly girls, eventually falls prey to his false pretenses. In  obtaining the trophy of the contest, Sebastian realizes he's not going for  the gold anymore but honestly loving Annette instead. In the end, his pride  overwhelms his desire to confess his true feelings. Not only does he suffer  the agony of defeat, but ultimately he loses what matters most.<br />  The  only thing I find redeeming about this movie is its hip soundtrack,  featuring artists like Blur, Counting Crows, The Verve, and Skunk Anansie.  It blends a great deal of talented artists in the alternative genre, giving  this immature film a cool, stylish flow. I also enjoyed watching Joshua  Jackson ham it up as the flaming gay acquaintance Blaine Tuttle, prodding a  macho, closet-gay boyfriend who insists to his college buddies that he's  straight as an ironing board. Well, a straight stick is crooked in the  water, and so is the vision for this film on all sides of the mirror,  especially in the department of direction. Roger Kumble was obviously  masterminding with a pre-pubescent slant when he cast this film because  both female leads are nearly adolescent in their appearance, highly  attractive and visibly well-endowed. There is also no realism involved in  any action of this movie and it's highly suggestive of what he thinks teens  crave for an ultimate fantasy lifestyle. Sure, I wouldn't mind owning a '56  Jaguar Roadster, but this film is unrealistic in the way it makes its  characters seem superhuman and overly mature. Nobody that age acts like  that and never will. It's just not palpable.<br />  If you want an honest and  true version of 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses' with class and sensibility, then  opt for Malkovich, Pfeiffer and Close. You definetely won't be smirking  when you watch some real adult actors work the camera.hat and never will.

0060926317|5.0|This book is one of the most influential works I have ever read.  Through her story, Marlo Morgan opened my mind to the awesome oneness of all life on this planet.  It is through her recognition of our fundamental  connection to nature and to the eternal, boundless energy of the universe  that Morgan's journey transformed her.  She succeeds in making the reader  appreciate the potential for both personal and global transformation  inherent in realizing that connection.

0671034065|4.0|This book was definitely worth waiting (and shelling out hardcover bucks) for.  Jaine and Sam are smart, strongwilled and sassy.  The interchanges between them are hilarious and hot, but not long enough.  Their characters  were not as completely developed as I might have liked, likewise their  relationship.  Perhaps it is because I liked these characters so much, I  just really wanted to see more interaction between them. I don't now if the  story just happened to turn out that way, or if Linda Howard is starting to  take the trend that some of the other Romance novelists have taken-less  relationship and sex, more adventure and danger.  I hope not, because we  all know that when we settle down with an LH novel, we are in for a steamy  read.  That is why I give 4 stars and not 5. <br />This was still one of  Howards' best.  While the romance between the characters is a bit of a  whirlwind (commonly found in Howards' work), there are no sappy,  stereotypical, aged moments.<br />The interactions between the group of  friends and even family members were great also.  Very humorous and also  realistic.  <br />This is and at the same time is not a typical Linda Howard  book.  Nonetheless, it is wonderful.
0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess warns us of what the future holds in his outstanding book &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;  This book became a classic when it was first published over thirty years ago.  The movie, which starred Malcolm  McDowell and was directed by the late Stanley Kubrick, has developed a cult  following.  <br />Alex, the protagonist, is the leader of a small gang in his  town.  He lives in a world where the hell-raising kids take over the night,  while the adults are at home glued to their TVs.  He steals, vandalizes,  rapes 10-year-olds, and much more.  He gets caught eventually and is sent  to prison for murder, where he hears about a new rehabilitation program  which he is eager to join.  However, rehab is far from what he expected,  and has some serious side-effects.  <br />Probably the most brilliant thing  about this novel is it's language.  Burgess invented a slang which Alex and  his friends (or &quot;droogs&quot;) use.  It's called Nadsat (which means  &quot;teen&quot;), and is widely based on Russian.  It takes a while to  pick up, but it's not all that difficult (there's an unofficial  Nadsat/English dictionary at clockworkorange.com).<br />The problem is, a lot  of people dismiss both the book and the movie and put them in the  &quot;violent, tasteless, shocking and corrupting&quot; category.  These  people have to see beyond the violence and realize this is clearly a work  of art.  This edition of the book includes the 21st chapter which has a  different (surprising, perhaps) ending (different from the first American  release and the movie).<br />I truly recommend this book to anyone.  It's  better than that Harry Potter junk anyway.
B00002Z88D|2.0|I am a die hard Metallica fan, but now I think it is time to die. The idea of symphony and metal is pretty good, but it is not adequately represented in either of these two CDs. Hearing my favorite songs mangled by Hetfield's  quickly turning geriatric voice far from impresses me, and it seems that  the classical side of the music is just an accompaniment. If the classical  part of the music were just taken out, then there would be little  difference. The long and short of it: unless you want to hear Hetfield moan  like an 80 year old into the mic, don't buy this one.

What more could you ask for ? But how could they have gone so wrong with  the last two albums? Just get this before anything else, then MG...that's  all the Oasis you will ever need.

0671034065|3.0|I've read everything Linda Howard has written (I think) and was anxiously awaiting her next hardback installment.  This was standard Howard fiction, but somehow it just wasn't as good as I expected, given her past  work.<br />The dialogue between the main characters was snappy, and the  general plot was good, with a twist at the end.  My dissatisfaction stems  from the lack of character development and relationship development between  hero and heroine.  Jaine goes from hating her neighbor to sleeping with him  in the span of about 100 pages, with little contact, conversation or  interaction between the two of them.  And you get the feeling that you  don't ever really know what the neighbor, Sam, thinks or feels.<br />Not a bad  book, but one that I'd wait for in paperback before buying.
B000025APX|5.0|Fine death metal with a psuedo-atmosphereic and even black edge to it.  The beautiful guitar melodies and harmonies are great.  The drumming is tight as hell.  The vocalist is quite versatile, his voice rangind to a low  growl to a higher shriek.  The listening experience creates a mideavil  milleu that brought me back the dark ages.  When reading along in the liner  notes(the vocals are great, but uncomprehendable), the music tells stories  of battle and such. As for the vocal converation(check the previous  reviews), there are few points to be made.  Yes, if you don't like screechs  and grows, then maybe this isn't for you.  But, this doesn't mean you must  abandon metal.  Bruce Dickenson(you should know who this is!) may possibly  be the greatest metal vocalist ever.
0446677450|5.0|I read this book about a month ago, and I am ready to read it again!   If you have come this far in considering purchasing this book, then you probably are seeking knowledge about making more money.  This book changed  my entire way of looking at money and my financial situation.  Since  reading the book, I have taken active steps forward in changing my personal  financial situation.  The first step was keeping an open mind and being  willing to change.  Mr. Kiyosaki's simple yet descriptive style and a  lifetime of personal experience, energized me as I read and I couldn't help  but be affected.  I encourage anyone who is not satisfied (financially) to  read this book.  I checked it out from the library, and once finished, I  bought my own.
0671042858|2.0|Stephen King is a writer who has ripened with age. He no longer writes horror stories, but humanity stories. We saw glimpses of it in his earlier work, but as he has gotten older, so have his novels.<br />He wrote a book  about a decade ago titled &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;. That book, about a  woman who is strapped to a bed for four days without rescue, is almost the  same novel as &quot;Gordon&quot;. A woman is alone with her thoughts,a  woman needs a figure to get out of the mess( in this case tom gordon, in  &quot;gerald's game&quot; her long time friend), each women is stalked by a  mythical, terrifying god-like figure, and each goes deep into the main  characters mind to find resolution to what ailement they might have(  trisha's mom and brother's fighting,in Gerald's Game her sexual abuse). In  &quot;Gerald's Game&quot; it's like somebody dared KING to write a novel  about a woman tied to a bed; in &quot;Gordon&quot; it's like somebody dared  the authour to write a novel about a girl trapped in the woods. If you read  both novels they are incredibly similar.<br />With that having been said, the  book isn't entirely bad. There are parts that are very good, but a climax  where a walkman is thrown at a bear that has been stalking a girl through a  swamp....please! Gordon I must say is nothing more than a wast of an  afternoon. A deep love for baseball is the best part about this book, but  even that is not enough to redeem it.
B000002O3I|5.0|Howlin' Wolf was the greatest blues singer of the Memphis/Chicago axis. No hyperbole - fact. He was also the second greatest blues songwriter of the 1950s (Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon, after all, share top billing there).  And this package of his first two albums are all the proof you'll need,  except for damn near everything else in the man's catalog. What makes these  two albums as important as they are is that they also served as one of the  basic texts of rock's rediscovery of the blues in the 1960s - particularly  for the like of the Yardbirds, their erstwhile lead guitarist Eric Clapton,  the Rolling Stones, and Cream, who made &quot;Spoonful&quot; one of their  signature pieces from the outset and probably sent a host of folk scurrying  to the source. What they discovered, if they were open enough, was perhaps  the least reconstructed of the Delta-Memphis bred bluesmen who fed the  Chicago blues scene. More than Muddy Waters or Sonny Boy Williamson,  Howlin' Wolf kept the balance between the Delta and Chicago even-up and  never let his root get too far from his tree. And riding the top, of  course, was that singular voice and phrasing style, the one which more than  any bluesman to follow Robert Johnson suggested both menace in the light  and the sun beneath the darkness. This disc is probably one of the ten  absolute requirements for any serious blues library. And it is dated not  one bar.
6305537798|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and thought it was so funny.  I went back to see it again in the theater a few days later.  Heath Ledger is great in it, not to mention his unforgettable smile!  The combo between Julia Stiles  and Heath is great on screen.  I recommend buying this movie because it's a  great modern-day Shakespeare comedy that the whole family will love.  I  know I do!
6301942647|5.0|This has to be without a doubt one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen. I think the visuals alone are a reason to own this movie. Admittedly I didn't understand the meaning behind all the stories, but that  did not hinder my enjoyment of this film. Yes, it is a little slow moving,  and if you don't like subtitles athen this is not a movie for you. However,  give it a try, you may be greatly surprised.     Also look for Martin  Scorcese in the fifth story.
B00003Q43A|2.0|Allright, check your brains in at the door because where this movie takes you it'll be a liability.  Aside from that, portions of the movie are humorous and there is even some good cinematography in certain places.  The  characters are likeable but completely unrealistic except for Judd Hirsch  who is simply horrible.  All its faults aside, this movie is a great way to  kill off a couple of hours.  I never did figure out why the alien in area  51 was so quick to announce his clan's intentions rather than lulling the  government into a false sense of security.  Then again why should that  bother me, it's perhaps the smallest hole in the plot.<br />  What really  stinks on this DVD though is the audio.  I was supremely dissapointed by  the lack of quality.  Compared to the Matrix it is garbage and compared to  many other movies it's plain bad.  Frankly, this has been one of the most  unimpressive audio efforts on DVD in recent memory.
031286504X|5.0|If it werent for Jaws, the genre that we know today would not existed. And if it werent for I am legend,by Richard Matheson, Stephen King and Clive Barker would be writting god knows what. Cause I Am Legend, a book about a  guy who is trapped in a world of vampiers is amazing, storyfull, scary,  paranoic and it has everything that a good novel needs. Bram Stokers  Dracula is still the best vampire novel, but I Am Legend is right behind  it. Thank you Richard for this great book (i think even vampires enyoed it  :))
0790734850|5.0|&quot;LA Confidential&quot; takes detective film noir in a different direction-something I didn't think could be done.  Director Curtis Hanson stated that he wanted the focus of this period piece to be on the  characters and dialogue rather than the locations, clothing, cars, etc.  I  think he got it right for the most part, but the cinematography is so  spectacular that you can't help but notice the backdrops against which the  scenes are set.<br />The acting performances in this picture are for the most  part first rate:  Guy Pearce plays the ambitious Edmund Exley to  perfection, Russell Crowe is superb as tough guy detective Bud White, and  Kevin Spacey (one of my favorite actors of all time) turns in a stellar  performance as the hip narco detective who also acts as a consultant on a  Dragnet-like TV series.  Strong performances by James Cromwell, Ron Rifkin,  and the ubiquitous David Strathairn round out the picture.  Although I  liked Kim Basinger, I thought she was cast more for her look than for her  acting skills.  She played the role of a Veronica-lake lookalike prostitute  quite well, but hers didn't look like a performance any other competent  actress couldn't have pulled off.<br />The DVD version of this picture is more  full of features than any other title I've owned thus far.  It includes a  documentary about the making of the film which includes cast interviews and  clips of Crowe's and Pearce's screen tests.  There's also a location map  that tells the viewer about each of the major locations where scenes were  shot, cast bios, a promo for the soundtrack (featuring some very good early  50's jazz courtesy of Chet Baker and other artists of the era), and the  movie can be played with just the soundtrack running.  Be warned-the  features that come in the DVD version take more time to watch as the movie.   But it's well worth the time!  &quot;LA Confidential&quot; sets a high  standard in terms of what studios should include in DVD's of their  pictures.  Are you paying attention, Hollywood?
0848806808|5.0|A highly comic romp with the English gentry, you know, those fellows of Eton, living in Manors (and having impeccable ones,I am told), with little to do but receive social approval for whatever they do; all with the  quietly dignified, prescient aid of their butler. Pleasant enough, but P.G.  Wodehouse masterfully parodies the upper crust and their sometimes foolish  pretenses as he skewers one Bertram \\"Bertie\\" Wooster (\\"A lesser man, caught  in this awful snare, would no doubt have ceased to struggle; but the whole  point about the Woosters is that they are not lesser men.\\"); often through  the verbal and psychological ingenuity of  \\"Jeeves,\\" the almost obedient  servant who masters the master  (\\"I fear, sir, that I was not entirely  frank with regard to my suggestion of ringing the fire bell\\").<br />Wodehouse  (who belongs with those other two-initialed humorists of the era, A.J.  Leibling, S.J. Perelman, and T.E. White) created icons and, perhaps, an  entire genre through Bertie and Jeeves. The dialogue is, as they say,  splendid: Droll and dry, understated yet preposterous.  Perhaps nowhere  else have the strictures of etiquette been exposed with such wit:  \\"A touch  of salmon?\\" \\"Thank you\\" \\"With a suspicion of salad?\\" \\"If you please.\\"  Wodehouse manages this satire through the first-person narrative of the  object satirized-no mean feat, what?  (You may find yourself uttering  Wodehousian English phrases for a few days after reading this.)  The plot  is a bedroom farce without the bedroom, with lots of the usual twists and  turns, but the ending is a little too neat. One reads Wodehouse, however,  mostly for his delicious language, his assortment of odd, engaging (and  oddly engaged) personalities, and, above all, his adroit sense of humor and  timing.  Right ho! Highly recommended.
B000000OAC|5.0|1977 was the year punk and disco exploded on the pop scene.  It was also the year that Queen's fellow rock dinosaurs Pink Floyd sang about pigs,dogs and sheep (as opposed to sex, drugs and rock'n'roll), Sun worshippers YES  came up with &quot;Going for the One&quot; with an album cover of a naked  man gazing at a tall building ...whatever Mr. Anderson meant by that,  Genesis thought the timing was right to release a double live album  featuring a 25 minute ditty about a SUPPER that is READY for  consumption...and Led Zeppelin did not have any new albums to offer  whatsoever.<br />No wonder, then, that The Sex Pistols and their spitting  likes as well as Serious-groin-problem-bros Bee Gees had an easy task of  topping the charts.  The world had been fed on heavy prog rock as main  course for a whole decade, and now wanted some light dessert to ease up on  the digestive system.   <br />Sure, Queen could have released their &quot;A  Night at the Opera part III&quot;(more Marx Brothers titles anyone? ) and  join the brigade of  &quot;boring old farts&quot; as the prog rockers were  called by the late 70s.  But having covered most themes in the art rock  book, i.e. mad prophets, adventure, pseudo religious &quot;good vs.  evil&quot; themes and science fiction they instead simplified their  approach and delivered a no nonsense and refreshing hard rock album that  was more in tune with the new musical directions of the times.<br />&quot;News  of the World&quot; was leather rather than silk and ballet. The Stomping  &quot;We Will Rock You&quot;, the ultra heavy &quot;Sheer Heart  Attack&quot;, &quot;Fight from the inside&quot; (which somehow makes me  think of the colour black)and the steamy &quot;Get Down Make Love&quot; sum  up their raunchy new styles very nicely.<br />Pomp is of course still here,  but in controlled proportions, in the shape of the lone tongue in cheek  &quot;We are the champions&quot;.  It just functions SO WELL sandwiched as  it is by &quot;We will rock you&quot; and &quot;Sheer Heart  Attack&quot;.<br />Ballads like &quot;All Dead All Dead&quot; and &quot;My  Melancholy Blues&quot; have a bitter taste to them rather than sugary, the  latter sounding  naked and lonely as opposed to previous album closers by  the group which were mostly pomp and circumstance.<br />Pop tunes are  inventive and differ greatly in styles.  &quot;Spread Your Wings&quot; has  Queen written all over it...irresistably catchy chorus. &quot;Who Needs  You&quot;, features wonderful spanish guitar runs from Brian May as well as  a playful Freddie Mercury.  Then there's &quot;Sleeping on the  Sidewalk&quot; which has groove to last a whole blues  festival...<br />&quot;It's Late&quot; proves that there was still some heavy  progrock left in them, epic in proportions as it is.  However, instead of  multilayered vocal mid sections or guitar orchestras for that matter, you  get pure and true heavy metal thrown in your face somewhere in the middle.   Furthermore, a simple love story makes the framework of the piece.  No  madmen in sight.<br />If you are new to Queen, News of the World is definately  an essential FIRST.<br />Other musts?  One idea for a newcomer to the world of  Queen could be building a collection by getting one album from each  &quot;stage&quot; (as I see it) of their prolific career:<br />1. 73-74 Heavy  Metal: Queen II 2. 75-76 Art Rock: A Night At the opera 3. 77-79 Hard Rock:  News Of the World 4. 80-82 Pop/Funk: The Game 5. 84-86 Pop/Rock: A Kind of  Magic 6. 89-91 Hard Rock revisited: Innuendo<br />Then you could start  &quot;filling it up&quot; by sticking to whatever personal preferences you  may have in musical styles (HM, pop, disco...), or follow my excample:BUY  EVERYTHING IN SIGHT! <br />Finally one plead to EMI: PLEASE, PLEASE RELEASE   &quot;EARL'S COURT 1977&quot; !
B000002VQQ|5.0|Sheer intensity!  One may hear hints of her in a few musicians, but there's only one Patty Smith.  She set the standard, yet remains an original.  <br />This is a concept CD, but the concept is musical, rather than  lyrical.  Beginning with the dissonant chords and long tonal lines of  \\"GLORIA,\\" Patty Smith goes on to punk-ture the rock landscape in about 43  minutes of tone poetry, screaming vocals and snarling guitar. It's the  musical equivalent of \\"Howl.\\" <br /> A few songs, or fragments of songs, are  somewhat melodic and playful, almost teasing.  While these are \\"easier\\" and  sound great, the CD is most notable for its shredding power, and the sound  of the most original female voice in rock.  Great support on guitar and  drums. Intense and poetic, yet somehow unaffected and sincere, she makes  the spoken/sung lyric not only compelling, but credible. <br />In many songs  it sounds like the rhythm might slip out from under the vocals and go on in  an entirely different direction.  There's something going on here!   Beautifully recorded and mixed, the voicings are distinct, both melodic and  dissonant.  Someone may observe these days, \\"that's been done before.\\"  It  probably has--by Patty Smith.  Highly recommended.

B0000021RB|5.0|The Chicago Transit Authority (later, just Chicago) got off to a great start with their first album.  They didnt officially choose a name for their band and just wanted to be reffered to as Chicago, the place they  originated from, because they wanted their album to be about the music, and  it sure is!  Their album's hard hitting and horn blowing mix of sounds  became definitive of the name Chicago.  The best part of the album is the  way all the band members come together, with their instruments  complementing each others sounds to make a real masterpiece.  It's rough  and hard but within limits that make the album so great.  Unlike later  albums where band members go off in their own direction, everyone works  together to make the songs work.  The album is truly about the music as  indicated by limited lyrics, just the right amount.  Not a single a track  is a let down. The listener becomes fully engulfed by this double album  set.  The only pity is that Chicago didn't stick with their cutting edge  sound; with subsequent albums deteriorating into the late 70's.  Chicago  Transit Authority is the greatest Album ever produced by Chicago and  possibly the greatest Album of the late 60's.
0679746048|5.0|When I picked up this book, I asked myself, \\"Do I really want to hear about a suicidal person?\\"<br />Well, I jumped in, and the answer is yes! This is a highly affecting and unique book, about people in a mental ward. It's structured a bit like a novel, rather than a slice of a real life, but the great writing style and unembellished characters make it all the better. The girl with an obsession about laxatives and chicken is my sister's favorite.<br />I'm not entirely certain what \\"Borderline Personality\\" means, but I don't really need to. It sort of is clear from the book itself.<br />This is funny, disturbingly precious, full of the kind of warped insanity that many, many people feel during their lives. Before any judgements are made about people with personality disorders, they should read this book to see inside their minds.
B00004THAY|4.0|&quot;CLAPTON RULES!&quot;  As a huge Clapton fan, I say that a lot.  After listening to his newest album, a collaboration with blues legend B.B. King, I'm considering changing that to &quot;CLAPTON AND KING RULE!&quot;   Simply put, this is a very good blues album!  The album opens with the  kickin', blues-rock title track and the magic continues from there.  One of  my all-time favorite blues songs in particular, &quot;Key to the  Highway,&quot; makes an appearance on this album.  This is a cool,  laid-back, acoustic version of the song.  (For the BEST version, though,  check out the version on the 1970 classic &quot;Layla and Other Assorted  Love Songs&quot; by Derek and the Dominos, which clocks in at over 9  minutes!)  Another highlight is yet another laid-back, acoustic version of  &quot;Worried Life Blues.&quot;  (Again, the BEST version can be found on  Clapton's 1996 &quot;Crossroads 2&quot; 4-CD box set.  For those who can't  afford the set, it is also available on the 2-CD &quot;Blues&quot;  collection, also by Clapton.)  But not all the songs are re-done versions  of my favorite Clapton tunes; &quot;Help the Poor&quot; can best be  described as a &quot;swampy&quot; blues song, kind of like what you'd  expect to hear out on the bayou.  Excellent!  But even at (6? 7?) minutes,  it isn't long enough!  For me, the album kind of peters out from tracks 9  thru 11 (hence, the 4-out-of-5-star review).  While those songs ARE good, I  think I need a little more time for them to grow on me.  The album ends on  a BEAUTIFUL note with the WAY too short &quot;Come Rain or Come  Shine.&quot;  I was truly disappointed when it (and the album) ended!  To  sum, this is a very good blues album, released by two of the greatest  blues-guitar legends.  Clapton is a longtime &quot;friend&quot; of mine,  but I hadn't really listened to much B.B. King.  I think that's about to  change as a result of this album.  I hope you, the reviewer/listener make a  new discovery or two as a result of listening to this jewel.
B000002UJQ|5.0|The first time I listened to &quot;OK Computer,&quot; I listened for close to five or six hours.  I was taken in from the start with &quot;Airbag.&quot; If you listen to this CD straight through, it almost  reminds you of am early Pink Floyd, the way that the songs flow together  perfectly. In the same respect, this could be compared to the Beatles  &quot;White Album,&quot; being that in itself, it is also a masterpiece,  that was ahead of its time, when first released. Every song on this album  has its place, and is equally as good as the ones before and after it.  Every song gives off a separate vibe, that carries a different emotion. The  computer effects on &quot;OK Computer&quot; are fantastic. You have to be  able to tolerate what some would call &quot;noise.&quot; But if you are  open to new things, and musical concepts, you'll love it. There are so many  messages sent through this album, and can help you get through them with  just listening to one or two songs. Its almost like going to a therapy  session with your CD player. In my opinion, this album is one of the  greatest Alternative albums of all time! (And, I don't use that phrase  often!) I own almost every import, video, and album put out by Radiohead,  but I am looking forward to their newest album to come out in October of  2000. I've heard Johnny has some amazing solos!
6305903182|3.0|This is addition to the film is the concluding part of the SCREAM trilogy and although I would have preferred more deaths and more of the original cast members to be killed, this final installment still keeps you jumping  out of your seat. This &quot;Final Act&quot; is not as good as it's two  predecessors but it is still an average finish to a good trilogy. In my  opinion the first &quot;Scream&quot; was the best and the following films  did not live up to the first film.  I think that &quot;Sream3&quot; was not  as good as the others because it was not as original as the first film and  everyone was comparing it to that because &quot;Scream&quot; re-defined  teen-slasher films. However, if you are not interesed in the film i would  definately say that the DVD is excellent. The extra features include  several deleted scenes, outtakes (which include some very funny scenes with  David Arquette! ), a Creed music video, a special &quot;making of&quot;  all three Scream films, a commentary with the man himself Wes Craven which  is very good, and plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied. All-in-all if  you like the Scream films then you will like this and if you don't you will  still have a good DVD in your collection!
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album is heavy beyond heavy, and the band is quite possibly the most aggressive band in the world of metal (or any other type of music for that matter). I recommend this album for those who can appreciate music that's  extreme, intense, severely energetic, and overflowing with anger and  energy. I would also say the album is quite original too.
6305363668|5.0|When I started to watch this movie, I thought is was going to be a non-stop action film with guns and explosions like Die Hard or Air Force One, but when I watched the whole movie I found out that I was very wrong.  <br />I am a big fan of action movies, and if you've seen Blade Runner, you  would think that I was very disapointed with the movie. Even though there  wasn't a lot of action, I still liked it. In fact, I loved it. <br />It was  pure genius. The acting, script, and the special effects were absolutely  marvelous. The plot was a little hard to follow, especially without the  narration that was in the origanal but didn't make it to Director's Cut.  But one of the good parts about that is that the Director's cut made you  think. It isn't one of those movies where you know everything right from  the beginning. Basically, it's a dark, mysterious, gothic, science fiction  movie in the deepest sense. <br />The setting was wonderful. The camera pans  around a lot on the city shots so you can see a lot of the dark, futuristic  Los Angeles in the year 2019. <br />Along with The Matrix, Star Wars, and  Alien, (yet another film by director Ridley Scott) Blade Runner stands out  as one of the best science fiction films ever made.
0786860707|5.0|I have, for several years, been a member of various computer animation lists, and that's where I'm coming from with this review. This is the one book which has consistently come up on those lists when dealing with  general issues (the Principles of Animation, etc), simply because it is the  best. It is not the best tutorial book, since it is not written as a  tutorial: it is a history of Disney. If you want a tutorial on computer  animation, go elsewhere. But that will probably NOT be as much help to you  as reading this book, because after reading this, you will be inspired. I  think this is why people are so religeously fervent when speaking about it  - not because they found it useful for the large number of techniques and  tips which are slipped in throughout (though very many of them are out of  date or not applicable in the computer animation world), but because the  book inspires. I thought it was expensive, but after I bought it and read  it the first time, I realised it was cheap at the price. It is gorgeously  produced, and filled with colour pics and examples of what it talks about.  Worth buying if you are into animation, or if you are interested in the  history of Disney.
6305364648|2.0|This film has some great scenes and everything but then goes off on this anti-women tangent which just goes on and on... This whole sub-plot about the cheating wife and the revenge taken upon her... .... This stupidity causes no less than  the setting off of an atomic bomb in the USA - somehow easily glossed  over?  And the level of anti-Arab sentiment is just beyond belief. I am  not an Arab myself but I couldn't take watching the stereotypes of  &quot;Arabs are all terrorists/fanatics&quot;, etc. A shame overall as it  did seem to have some worthwhile potential...
6303855466|5.0|This is a very funny movie about two English cartographers who create a stir in a small Welsh community by declairing the community's prized mountain, a hill. I loved this movie. If you like Hugh Grant or Colm Meaney  you'll love this movie. I give TEWUAHBCDAM, *holds up hand like a little  kid* FIVE STARS!
B00000JGHM|5.0|A fascinating story. Ultimately the thief and the detective chasing him are pretty much the same type. Using similiar methods. The detective teams up with a SERIAL KILLER (Wayne Gro in the film) and a car thief in order to  &quot;get&quot; to his main objective - the big time thief. Pacino as the  detective embraces the mother of the murdered prostitute and comforts her,  but later works with the killer... who is ultimately very justly killed by  - De Niro the thief. Life shows us that right and wrong is very, very  ambiguous. This is not something you are taught in school. I was taught  that right and wrong are absolutes. This is why my young mind appreciated  Star Wars so much. Darth Vader was evil and even said it himself,  &quot;join the Dark Side&quot;. Obi-Wan was loving and good. The hassle is  that life isn't this way and this film, HEAT, remarkably shows that fact.  The truth in the &quot;big city of LA&quot; or in reality anywhere, is that  everyone makes choices and good/bad or right/wrong are only shades of grey,  not absolutes.
6301971582|5.0|This Movie is the best. It takes place in the future where people live in domes and are killed when they turn thirty by people called Sandmen. Logan is a sandman and he goes on a mission to find out where escaped people  (Runners) go by becoming one himself. This is a great movie and you should  buy ten copies of  it and give them to your friends. I give Logan's Run  *Eats five Whoppers* FIVE STARS!
0802136834|4.0|The Six Wives of Henry the Vll is a good read. I read this book not to long ago and it gives all the information on all six of his wives. Reading this book gave me things I never would of known if I hadn't read it. At  some parts of it got a little boring,and sometimes described things a  little to vividly but for the most part it was very interesting.
6304415346|4.0|I am the biggest ST fan in the world and I loved this movie. Frakes is a good director. I liked how the Enterprise crew went back in time and helped Cochrane carry out his warp flight and how the Borg tried to stop them but  couldn't. The only downside to the movie is that it's targeted to the  &quot;dumb crowd&quot; and also that it's about Picard and Data. Am I the  only person, or do the rest of you want the rest of the crew in the movie?  I give ST: FC *Marks a four on top of Picard's head* a four.<br />PS. the  drunken Deanna scene was the best part.
0780625129|5.0|This movie is about a man called Derek, he is a nazi.  And you see how he and his brother are dealing with his family.  His brother are following in his footsteps all the time.  But one day something happends, and he realize  how stupied it really is, and tells to his brother(Edward Furlong) how  horrible he had it in Jail!   But will his brother do as he now?  This  movie is so great, that I couldnt really describe what I felt after coming  out of the cinema(yeah this time it was cinema for a change), I was just  stood there, and thought  &quot;WOW! &quot;.  Edward Norton, IS INCREDIBLE  GOOD in this movie, but so is his younger brother(E.Furlong) they are both  in a class for themself. And it deals with problems that probably always  will be there, it shows how people get tricked by listening to others, how  parents can have an effect on their childrens, with hatred chat about  people with other color of their skin ect. SEE THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW!   IT IS A MUST!
0688170528|4.0|Excellent look at the torment of two families and their children, when things turn out to not be as perfect as they seemed on the outside
0375420525|5.0|When I first started reading this book, I was like &quot;Eh, okay, whatever&quot;.  But as I progressed, I found it hard to put down.  When I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.  I also found myself taking it  with me wherever I go just in case I'll have an extra few minutes.  The  thing I like the best is the typeset-- it keeps changing as the house  changes.  Crazy, but brilliant.  Definitely one of the best books I've  read.
6305558167|4.0|I really liked this movie on every level but one. It had the gutsy, down and dirty look of the middle ages and was a classic retelling of an age-old tale. The movie had excellent performances by all, but what really held it  up even more was the magnificent cinematography<br />My only real quibble with  this movie is the extremely choppy use of the classical music pieces in the  soundtrack. I am a strong believer in the old saw that sound makes a good  movie really great. Well, the little snippets of well-known classical music  thrown in here and there was sometimes rather grating. The musical pieces  used are well known and mostly Wagnerian. Letting them run a bit longer  when they were used would have greatly enhanced the movie. As it is, they  only served to make the movie seem choppy in spots.<br />Make no mistake: this  is a great movie, a real collectible.
B0000035E7|5.0|This is for the real rock fans.  This CD is a must buy for the real Nirvana and rock fans, it is a staple to our generation, it is unadaltered and it's purest form.  There is so much I want to say about this CD but I  cannot formulate it into words.  So much emotion, so much agony, this CD is  for the people that remember Kurt Cobain, and love his legacy.  All of  Nirvana's CD's were so full of emotion, this is a must buy cd. I have  listened to all of Nirvana's cd's over 1000 times, (honestly, no lie) and  Inever get tired of them; because the lyrics have such a deep meaning, and  show Kurt's truly tormented soul. There is no one single song that is good;  EVERY single song they made was good. It's such a shame that only a few  cd's could be recorded of the best band ever - Nirvana.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Anyone who rates this bad didn't get it.  What a great mix of documentary &amp; drama style, mixed in with Crowe and Pacino's awesome performances.<br />This movie tackles several serious &quot;today&quot; issues  with realism without preaching too much, like many Hollywood films  do.<br />Great job!
6302779278|5.0|This is a brillient film with 2 great talents coming together to play the main characters. Actor Kevin Costner plays Frank Farmer, The Bodyguard &amp; singer Whitney Housten,plays famous popstar Rachel Marron. She starts  being pestered by an obsessive fan who has turned nasty and started sending  threatening letters, so Frank farmer is employed to protect her, against  her wishes. But she finds herself falling  in love with him, &amp; after a  lot of nasty incidents is glad that he is there to look after her. Kevin  Costner &amp; Whitney Housten both play their parts very well, with great  chemistry between them. There are  great Whitney songs such as, her no. 1  single &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;  &amp; &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;  &amp; &quot;Queen Of The Night&quot; There is also a good supporting cast.  Its a film I have seen many times &amp; never get tired of &amp; I`m sure  if you buy it you will feel the same. One of the best films of the 90`s.
B000002Q7Y|4.0|I would love to see this particular band return to its former popularity. They are so talented and gifted (and underrated).  For those folks who might be just discovering Kansas, a tip: Most of Kansas' musical gems never  made it to the airwaves.  The real masterpieces are hidden in their albums  of earlier years and sadly escaped the credit and acclaim they deserved.  &quot;Power&quot; while not Kansas' biggest commercial success, highlights  and displays one of the finest lead vocalists in rock history, Steve Walsh.  Buy this CD if only for Steve Walsh's vocal performance on the track  &quot;Can't Cry Anymore&quot; an incredibly passionate song about the pain  and disappointment of a failed relationship. This is one of the most  emotionally and intensely moving ballads I have ever heard.  Don't be  surprised if you are moved to tears!  While the rest of the songs may not  be &quot;classic&quot; Kansas, they are highly enjoyable nonetheless.   Check out the rest with a fresh view, and you will appreciate the  versatility and variety in this highly musical effort.
B000002H2H|5.0|Fade to black and creeping death alone is worth buying the album, but every song on it is good.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I can't understand why this band is popular, they are just another dime a dozen &quot;RAGE&quot; band.The good thing is that they will meet the same fate as all the eighties hair bands....an early grave!
B000002H97|5.0|98% of everyone who listens to heavy metal owns this album.  Even if you don't have the cd you've probably already heard half the songs on it anyways. Its a very good cd and if you don't already have it go ahead and  get it now because your going to end up getting it sometime before you die.   METALLICA RULES
0440213525|4.0|Excellent legal thriller with a young boy as the center point of the story.  Excellent entertainment to spend time reading or watching the video.
B000002MTU|5.0|I think a lot of you guys are missing the point about this album. One guy said &quot;he is far from being one of the greatest traditional electric bluesman&quot;. That should be plainly obvious. Eric Clapton is not a  traditional bluesman. He's a rock and roll musician all the way, who was  deeply influenced by the blues. He's great at playing the blues, but Muddy  Waters he ain't. Remember that Clapton is NOT a Mississippi-born country  boy who grew up playing guitar in the cotton fields. He's British. He grew  up a world away from blues culture. From The Cradle, in my opinion, is not  bad at all for an Englishman. Heck, it would be pretty good for a  Mississippi/Chicago native. With From The Cradle, Clapton is not trying to  pronounce himself as the second coming of the blues. He's just paying  homage to the music and the musicians which deeply inspired his playing.  Even B.B. King himself said that Clapton is one of the best blues players  in the world. And if B.B. King doesn't know soul when he hears it, then no  one does. <br />I agree that the music of B.B., Robert Johnson, John Lee  Hooker, etc is much better blues than this. But this album should not be  compared to &quot;real blues&quot;, the same way that a tribute album  should not be compared to the music of the original artist who is recieving  the tribute. <br />Great album. If listening to this CD doesn't make you get  down on your knees and worship Clapton, then you'd be better off listening  to Britney Spears.
1878424319|4.0|My biggest complaint about this book was that the author offered little or no information about how to use this book in our everyday lives. I noticed that the author had commented on the book after I had reviewed it,  describing how to put the book into practical use.  I found this  information very useful and wondered why he did not include this in his  book.  If he had included this in his book, I would have given it 5 stars  instead of 4. The author should consider adding this info into the book  when it is reprinted.  The information appears on the Amazon page for the  book, under the published reviews for the book.
B00004T8RK|1.0|This CD is without a doubt the worst Pearl Jam effort I have ever heard. I've read reviews that advise listening to it several times before you judge it however, once was honestly all I could handle. For those of us who have been listening to Pearl Jam over the years, they have often included the occasional out of tune, slightly off key track in some of their albums but this sounds as if disharmony and for lack of a better word \\"weird\\" ho-hum effects were the goal. Get back to basics Eddie........<br />Ask youself this, \\"When was the last time I heard anything from this album played on ANY radio station?\\"
1577311523|5.0|I've been looking for this book a long time, down many dead-ends.  Usually, \\"simple\\" = shallow, and \\"profound\\" slides into wordy.  The book should be printed highlighted! Every sentence in it is  powerful.  Direct without being harsh, he makes a lot of our mind-based  beliefs look the nonsense they are, and impossible to continue.
0312853238|5.0|Ender's Game is an awesome start to an incredible series of books! If you don't think you like sci fi books, don't let that stop you from reading Ender's Game.  It's unlike any other sci fi book out there.  The storyline  grabs you and keeps you hooked, but the best thing about this book is the  characters! You really get to know them and become engrossed in their  lives, then you can't wait to read the other books in the series to find  out what happens next. I've read these books several times and I always  enjoy them.  Check out Card's other books, too. They are all great!  Also,  keep an eye out for the upcoming Ender's Game movie!
B000002U82|5.0|in 73 i was 13 and listening to my new  stepbrothers records on headphones while he was at work. after a few forgetable ones, i tried the black one  with the prism on it. my perception of  music has never been the same.           here was an album that speakes to me,like none other. closing my eyes,  i saw any colour i liked. i knew that as soon as i had the time and money,  i would be on the run to get my own great gig in the sky. perhaps i am  brain damaged, but in 27 years, nothing has ever eclipsed this album.!               millions love this album,some people hate it. decide for yourself  if you are one of us, or them.                     p.s. pink floyd has sold  an average of 1 album every 8 seconds for 36 years,   15000000 devided by  36 dv by 365.25 dv  24 dv by 60 =7.92 per minit.            dsotm has sold  1 copy every 34.09 secs  for 27 years. if nobody else on earth had ever  bought a copy, it would still be my favorite. and no, 5 stars is not enuff.
6300183971|5.0|Dune is one of my all-time favorite movies. It's hard to take in and it moves slow, but is worth it in the end, especially for Sting's final scene.
B00004KD1L|4.0|I like it.  Not super boring/repetitive.  If you like Kruder and Dorfmeiester, GA will do you just fine.  Is it me, or does &quot;Chicago&quot; have a funky little Prince guitar thing going  on?<br />Enjoy your day!
B000022TSY|5.0|The VHS version does not do justice for hopper/fonda's masterpiece work.  DVD all the way.  I couldn't believe how 'new' it looked when i saw it for the first time on widescreen/dvd.  This was always a favorite flick of  mine.  It is a classic.  Yer basic story of 'drug-dealin' buddies, sell  their stuff, make money, get bigger bikes and go cross country on two  Harley's during the era of &quot;Beautify America&quot;, a time of  revolution and peace, love rock and roll.  Rock and roll: Easy Rider has  one of THE best soundtracks as well; Steppenwolf's &quot;The Pusher&quot;  and &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; fit the scenes QUITE well.  The Byrd's  &quot;I wasn't born to follow&quot;, The Band's  &quot;The Weight&quot; and  Jimi's &quot;If Six Was Nine&quot; made their marks in history by their  musical impact in this film.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper portray Wyatt  (Capt. America) and Billy (the Kid) in this biker/western cult classic.   &quot;Gotta get to Mardi Gras, man!&quot;.  Luke Askew plays an awesome  hippie/guru head of a hippie haven located in the middle of the desert.   Jack Nicholson &quot;George Hanson/Blum-blum-blum-tang!&quot; plays a 'well  educated' lawyer tryin' to get outta jail....it all flows together so well.   The movie starts off with Wyatt and Billy snorting cocaine, then they  smoke grass then they drink wine/liquor and then they trip in the gravest  of places...a graveyard with two 'whores' from that house mentioned in that  Animals song.  After the first time I saw this film, i was inspired to go  out and make my own...I may do so, someday.  I think what makes this a  classic flick, the fact that when it was released we had wars going on in  Vietnam and at home in the US of A, between protestors and government.   This flick avoids government and Vietnam war, just the war between mellow  peace bikers against an irrate southern USA culture.....but it goes for the  sex, drugs, rock and roll....cornerstone of any nutrious-best movie of alltime.....This dvd version also features the making of the film which is  interesting to listen to Dennis, Pete, Luke and other writers and crew  about the troubles that made Easy Rider the classic that it is.....
B0000060LT|5.0|The Ufkoko-EP, released between Horse Stories and Ocean Songs, was devided in to two pieces. The first song, To Aster!, sounded rough and uptempo, while the rest of Ufkoko sounds far more modest and the songs seem to  contain more color.  In Dirty Three-terms, To Aster! is a live-song;  from the beginning on, the band had left their quiet, emotional songs at  home, whilst playing on tour, to bring only the rougher, mostly climaxed  songs with them. Even on Horse Stories, there are some 'live'-songs, even  some songs that had accompanied the Dirty Three on tour for years and were  begging for a place on the CD. Despite of the high quality of those songs,  they don't seem to stimulate the album to become a coherent whole, and  that's an important criterion for the quality of this kind of music.   On Ocean Song, these properties are better worked out. Being introduced by  the loose, improvisative play of the guitar (Mick Turner) and the violin  (Warren Ellis), the songs seem to be rolling off a hill, accompanied by the  almost melodic sounds of the drum, played by Jim White. To where? To the  ocean, because that's where all things are going to happen this time. In  contrast with the previous recordings, not only the songtitles or the  beautiful paintings by Mick Turner follow the theme - every single song  seems to be drowned in the blue of the sea. A dark shade of blue of course;  the Dirty Three are not here to tell us about the joy of the world, they're  here to tell help us when we are having a sad time.  And we are,  twenty-four hours a day.
6303168507|5.0|Great work and great job by all. Spielberg did another greeat movie expierence by me. I really liked this tremendously! Wow what a movie this is!
6305892806|5.0|After reading all of Austen's novels, I do consider myself a pretty ardent and faithful fan.  And of course I have long waited eager anticipation for Rozema's daring adaption of Austen's most controversial and complex novel.   I can assure you the after-taste of my fist viewing was quite nameless.   First of all, no film should be condemned for being discursive from the  book, and Rozema should definitely be applauded for what she attempted with  this classic. The original novel is the darkest in theme among Austen's  known works, and Rozema has a keen eye for the sparks lurking in the  darkness of Mansfield Park and she captures them well with her camera and  her dialogues. At times however, one feels the political aspect of slave  trade is rather too patent, yet the arguments do provide a fertile ground  for the character Fanny Price to blossom.  Frances O'Connor subtly takes  away the painfully shy, clumsy country girl and presents us a revolutionary  young woman of the new ages.  The rest of the cast is brilliant as well and  they fit nicely into the niches painted by Rozema.  Some say Austen would  be rolling in her grave for the bold liberty Rozema takes: Sir Bertram's  unexplored sexual exploits, virtue of wealth, and worth of love for  example; but all works out for modern viewers who are more or less tempted  by the same conceptual doubts, be it 2006 or 1806.  So don't call me an  infidel for giving this &quot;rebel&quot;, brow-raiser 5 stars, only a true  admirer of Austen's spirit can probe to such depth and uncover the courage  of Fanny.  After all, Austen was a rebel for her age, and through Rozema's  witty script, superimposing Austen's own toiling youth against Fanny's  literary fancies, are we able to sigh in relieve and curtsey in response to  the towering strength of one woman.

074350061X|5.0|This book was by far one of Mrs. Howard's best endeavors. Her witty style and comic characters kept the story fast-paced and exciting. The complexities of the plot pulled me in and kept me reading until I finished  and left me marveling at the ending. Mrs. Howard's style of writing in this  book made it one of the best I've ever had the pleasure to read. This story  is about four friends who come up with a list of what makes the perfect  man. Although it started out as a joke, the list quickly made it's way into  the news. Unfortunately, a man who is not so perfect takes exception and  murders two of the friends, and one of the friends, Jaine, enlists the help  of her policeman neighbor, Sam. As the plot unfolds, the two fall in love,  but can Sam prevent the killer from ruining that love?
B000002L5I|5.0|When I heard the samples of the songs I was amazed on how coll they were. My new favoite singer is Kenny Wayne Sheppered.
B00004U8H4|5.0|I seem to be one member of an elite group of people who absolutely LOVED this film. Upon seeing AMERICAN PSYCHO in a sold-out theater, it was painfully obvious to me that most of the movie-goers in there were  expecting something along the lines of SCREAM. A crumby slasher flick. A  story which displays a number of gruesome and well-thought out deaths. A  story where there is a hero. A story which ends happily ever after. This  movie had none of the above, which is what made it such a fantastic and  original film. Despite the graphic violence portrayed in the novel by Bret  Easton Ellis, most of the killing is off-screen and left to the viewers'  imagination. But the slaughter is also accompanied by fabulous black  humour. In fact, I can't remember the last time that I laughed so hard at a  movie (and was looked back at like there was truly something seriously  wrong with me). Mary Harron does a fantastic job directing this movie and  her decision to cast (and stand behind) Bale as Bateman is nothing more  than perfect. *Some may know that Harron temporarily left the directors'  chair when the studio told her that Bale would be replaced by Leonardo  DiCaprio. The film was almost given to Oliver Stone, but came back to  Harron when Leo decided against the role...THANK GOD! All-in-all, AMERICAN  PSYCHO is flawless. If you've got a taste for humour which is black as  night, a knowledge of 80's pop culture and if you know just a tad about  serial killers and the fact that they can indeed be that handsome man next  door, you'll EAT THIS MOVIE UP!   Enjoy!
B00004S8Q9|5.0|This is the best out of the three Badlands CDs. It basically sounds like a live recording in a studio, free from stacks of overdubs and effects. When listening to this CD, you can imagine Badlands playing onstage in a small  western saloon making the floorboards shake. As American as baseball and  apple pie, this CD delivers.
B00000373U|5.0|Well, before I heard this CD I'd never even heard of Elliot Smith. I borowed it off my cousin and it was great! Speed trial's and alameda are just the start, it get's better all the way through. But to top it off, the  last song, say yes is great. His liquid smooth voice coming out over the  great guitar work is just brilliant. Any one who's contemplating getting  this CD, don't think twice, it's great. I strongly recomend it if your a  fan, but if your not, it's a great introductory.
B00004TH83|2.0|When I first bought this album, I thought I was gettimg the next Cher or Madonna.  I mean the track &quot;I Will Love Again&quot;, is really hot right now.  It has that &quot;Believe&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot; feel to it.   So I honestly thought the whole cd had that type of style.  To my  disappointment, Lara Fabian is just a carbon copy of Celine Dion.  Nothing  unique, nothing original.  Buy the single you'll get some really awsome  mixes.  But don't waste your time or money, unless you like that mushy  kinda stuff.
0553275976|4.0|Tom Wolfe's kinetic style of writing takes some getting used to. He piles words on top of words, images on top of images, flinging them all at the reader with a fastball pitch. The pitch, though, is well-thrown. <br />Wolfe's  subject is New York City during the 1980s. He touches as many groups as he  can -- wealthy Upper East Side socialites, tabloid journalists, criminals  and burnt-out agents of justice in the Bronx, cut-throat sleazy lawyers,  unscrupulous Wall Street stockbrokers... No class of people escapes having  its faults exposed in Wolfe's sharp, accurate prose.<br />Wolfe is sociologist  first, novelist second. He probes the psychology of all these disparate  groups and finds a common denominator: selfishness. All people are out for  themselves no matter who is destroyed along the way.<br />At the same time he  satirizes the dark side of the human experience, Wolfe makes it impossible  to hate any of the characters. There is no true villain in this story. As  readers, we are left with just the uncomfortable sensation of recognizing  human nature's ugly parts.<br />&quot;How much differently would you act in  this situation?&quot; is Wolfe's implicit question. There are no easy  answers.
B00000K2SC|5.0|If you choose this movie hoping to see non-stop action, you might be a little disappointed. While The Matrix boasts a number of shoot-'em-up, kick-'em'-in-the-head battle scenes further illuminated by the next wave in  special effect technology, this movie also a number of thought-provoking  questions as to the nature and existence of reality itself.<br />The action  gives the film its blockbuster appeal, but the meat of the story lies in  the philosophy behind it. I read in the newspaper that a college somewhere  in the eastern U.S. taught a class about The Matrix's philosophy on  reality. If you're not looking for something that will challenge your own  world view, this movie's not for you.<br />But if you want something that both  makes your heart race and the wheels of your mind turn, accept no  substitute. The Matrix has no equal.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I LUV  this Cd!  She's not so  &quot;Look I'm Miss  lil' innocent Bubblegum pop diva&quot;  anymore !I thought her first album  was Ok but this Cd  is so good!   Lucky is got such a good beat!    &quot;What u see is what u get&quot;  is so infectus!   I was humming it all day!
B00004UEDR|5.0|Sandra Bullock is the industry's favorite girl next door, much to her own well-reported chagrin.  But there is just something about her that exudes &quot;next-door&quot; charm, whether or not she supports the label's  overuse. Maybe it's because she's such a gem of a person, especially  compared to the coldness of many of today's big stars.<br />So when you are  about to see this film you will anticipate that it be light-hearted, not  serious, in other-words, totally Sandra.  But the only thing light-hearted  about the movie are the circumstances several of the supporting cast  members get themselves into. Sandra plays this alcoholic with all of the  angst she's got. And it's a heck of a lot more than anyone would have  pegged her for.<br />So is she depressing to watch like this? Yes and no.   Depressing because, based on those nasty preconceptions us lazy viewers  have, you're waiting for her to jump out and say &quot;Just kidding!&quot;  throughout the movie - her usual style - and, to everyone's surprise, she  really doesn't.  She gives every ounce of credibility and intensity to a  role that many would like to write off simply b/c it is too hard to change  one's preconceptions.<br />I am so excited when I stumble upon a performance,  such as this one, that allows me to deepen my respect for an actor.  Sandra  has deepened everyone's respect with this role.  She is a consummate  professional actress: She plays every role as if it were herself and only  herself on the screen.<br />And hey, even if it IS only acting, she fooled me  . . .
0671034065|5.0|Someone really needs to talk to Linda Howard about keeping her readers up all night!  Mr. Perfect did it to me again--I could not put it down!  Ms. Howard had me hooked into the story in the first few pages.  Her writing  has always been a good read, but this book is a heart-stopper for anyone  who has ever compiled a list about the perfect mate.  Jaine Bright is  another memorable Howard heroine--gutsy, brainy, and a little quirky.  Sam  Donovan is wonderful, even if he does wake up his neighbors at 3:00 in the  morning!  As for Corin---he is someone I don't want to meet any time soon!    Thanks, Ms. Howard, for another great night, even if I didn't get any  sleep!
0783240503|1.0|Donny Osmund is fantastic. But I would never let my children watch this video. I can't believe how the women are portrayed in this production --  obviously there are none in the story, so the women can't be anything but  chorus members. But that doesn't mean they have to be chorus members from a  burlesque show. Jacob even gets seduced by a sexy dancer! Was this  necessary?  Especially in a show marketed to families! The production was  overdone, and I don't care if the man IS Richard Attenborough, he can't  sing. How about hiring singers for a musical? What a radical idea! Anyway,  if you like the show and want to share it with your family, buy the album  and go see a local production. Too bad this was such a lost opportunity.  Especially considering what a wonderful Joseph Donny made . . .
B000003TA4|5.0|As with the Beatles being the greatest band of all-time I think their is equally little room for argument with Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; being hailed the greatest albulm of the 90's. Not only is its impact impressive,  the albulm itself achieves a rare feat of having each one of its songs  being completely listenable. When you pop this CD in your car, the only  thing that'll distract you is your cell phone- not having to worrying about  skipping the next few songs to get to a good one. From its huge hits in  &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Come As You  Are, and &quot;In Bloom&quot; to the more fan-favorite songs of &quot;Drain  You&quot; and &quot;On a Plain&quot; Nevermind comes strong and stays  strong. If you don't have this record in your collection, then you  definatly have a huge gap in 90's music that should be filled with this  classic.
B000002H38|5.0|Truly her best effort as a while as far as consistancy and charm.  Here, Ms. Baker's voice is slightly more timid, adding an innocence that makes an interesting contradiction with her mature smokiness.  The songs, in the  end, seem more airy and she uses the melodies as floats to weave her  beautiful stories.  I would count as faults the last track, &quot;Watch  Your Step&quot; and the length of the disc. (Who can get tired of listening  to her? ) Otherwise, buy it and finally have all that a true R &amp; B  listener would consider classic.  It truly is a classic.
B000002BFZ|3.0|In looking through the Pearl Jam Catalogue one quickly finds that their first (and I would argue, best) albulm, &quot;Ten&quot;, stands out as a sonic anomaly. While &quot;No Code&quot; has some very good songs on it  like &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;, and &quot;Off He  Goes&quot; this albulm really marks the band's movement toward darker, more  moderate rock hues. While &quot;Hail, Hail&quot; just flat out rocks, songs  like &quot;Who You Are&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; show exemplify the fact  that Pearl Jam has changed its sound considerably over the past few  alblums. This albulm is indeed not a bad one indeed, but compared to what  Pearl Jam has produced in the past, besides Yield, it may be its weakest.  As the last three PJ releases have shown the die-hard fans continue to love  the band througout its musical progress (?), but many other listeners  within the mainstream have clearly left support of the band. Everyone will  admit the band's sound has changed and &quot;No Code&quot; can be seen as  either the first revolution towards this end, or the start of the band's  overall devolution.
0395925037|1.0|....Historians should read Shirer's biography or &quot;Rise andFall of the Third Reich&quot;.  The problem with this whole&quot;Hitler in his own words&quot; thing is that this isn't an organized manifesto at all. It doesn't even qualify as a decent rant. It reads like what it is, a transcribed series of demented monologes dictated by *der Adolf* while he was cooling his heels in jail after the failed Munich *putsch*.  Sure it's all in there, the Holocaust, the war, the whole schmeer, but who can wade through the morass of turgid prose to find it?  Who would want to?  Imagine reading a transcript of fifty drunken, disjointed, endless *speils* by your racist old uncle against Jews, bankers, Communists and whoever else he had decided to hate that day.  That's what it's like--no, it's worse, imagine if the transcript had been translated from German. <br />Whatever your reasons for wanting to read &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, there are better uses for your time.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Finally, Matthew Bourne's innovative production of Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE is available on DVD. This is not a camp send-up of the balletic war horse,  but a modern, freshly imagined telling of a tale of enchantment, betrayal,  disenchantment, and release. What most people already know about this  production is that the swans and cygnets are performed by male dancers,  that the choreography emphasizes the aggressive rather than the graceful  movements in swans' repertoire, and that the story is heavily freighted  with Freudian implications as it shows a young prince's efforts to break  free of his mother's hold (she's part Merry Widow and part Cruella deVil).  The viewer who tries to analyze plot points too carefully is heading toward  frustration and confusion. (For those who just can't let it alone, there's  a helpful on-screen synopsis you can jump to whenever you need it.) The  best way to enjoy this production is by focusing on the choreography and  the dancing itself. Adam Cooper's nameless Swan is powerful, persistent,  and unapologetic. He could be the prince's alter ego, his embodied desires,  the id, or just about anything else you'd want to ascribe to him. He woos  son and mother with equal conviction. Besides the moments when Cooper is on  stage/screen, the choreographic hightlight of this production for me was  the dance of the cygnets (pas de quatre). This is a moment of levity in  every production of SWAN LAKE, but more so here where the mischievous  antics and curiosity of the cygnets are played for all they're worth.<br />The  other thing worth commenting on is the quality of the filming of this live  performance. I have usually been disappointed by ballets on  film--presentation is often static, or feet and hands get cut out of the  picture, or the camera goes in for a close-up at a point when something  significant is happening in the choreography. Given the trade-offs,  Adventures in Motion Pictures has done an excellent job of capturing all  the key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and  montages. The colors are rich and expressive (the dance of the swans by the  lake is bathed in a haunting nocturnal blue). And best of all, the film is  completely free of the annoying halos and bizarre shimmerings that always  seem to make their way into filmed stage productions.key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and  montages.

0812550706|5.0|I picked up Ender's Game on impulse because I'd heard so many gret things about the book.  I was hooked from page one and barely put it down until I was finished.  The plot is a creative one, and extremely well written.   Ender is an interesting character, as are his siblings, Peter and  Valentine.  They are all deep, and easy to sympathize with.  (Peter took  some warming up to, as others can verify, but in the end, all I could feel  was pity for him.)  The ending left me hanging, and I raced to find the  others.  (If you want to know how I felt about those, you'll just have to  go to their review sections.) All in all, a wonderful book.  Read it soon!

B000002OMN|1.0|The original &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; held a certain perverse fascination to it.  Overblown.  Overwrought.  Amazingly pretentious and totally devoid of any trace of humor or spontaneity.  Listening to it was  sort of like watching an accident that you can't prevent.  You know it is  going to happen, you know it is going to be awful, yet you can't stop  yourself from taking part.<br />So when Meat Loaf's career nose-dived after  the album exploded in 1978, it was fairly inevitable we would get the  sequel, and in 1993 we did.  The problem is that by then the whole gimmick  had gone from being bizarrely fascinating to being downright unpleasant.   This is almost a note for note remake of the first &quot;Bat&quot; except  for the fact that it is even more unpleasant, and doesn't hold that  horrific appeal.  The songs are bad (understatement) the arrangements  bombastic and the whole project is lacking a trace of charm.  Forget it.
B00000IL1K|5.0|This album is beautiful.  I was fortunate to see Ms. Brightman's Eden concert last year and I was totally blown away.  When I listen to this cd, images of the concert are in my head.  Ms. Brightman is an awesome  performer and I love her wide range of styles.  I am an eclectic person and  I love albums with different kinds of songs and this one is the best!  I  can't say enough good things about it.  I love all of Ms. Brightman's  albums.  A true Brightman fan should not go without this one or the video  of her concert.

B00004STPT|5.0|Excellent.  I was so hesitant about buying this, because I thought it would get really irritating - but it hasn't.  It is amazing music to drive to and you can even sing along with the big tunes.  YAY!
B0000025BL|2.0|There is something almost perversely fascinating about &quot;Bat Out of Hell.&quot;  It isn't very good music.  In fact it is mostly pretty horrid.  Yet it is almost a situation in which it is so bad that one can't stop  listening to it.  There is the occasional listenable melody, the always  painfully overwrought lyrics, and the embarrassingly overblown production.   Somehow it all adds up for the perfect music for masochists.
B000002IOW|4.0|Rolling Stone Record Guide said about the Beach Boys' album &quot;The Beach Boys Love You&quot; (released in 1977) that it was the band's last gasp at brilliance.  They followed that by stating, &quot;After that album  the trap door opens and BOOM!,&quot; obviously referring to all subsequent  Beach Boys efforts.  Well, the exact same thing could be said about the  Rush album &quot;Presto.&quot;  Before &quot;Presto&quot; Rush had released  two disappointing albums in a row (&quot;Power Windows&quot; in 1985 and  &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot; in 1987) and seemed to be in serious decline  both artistically and commercially.  However, 1989's &quot;Presto&quot; was  a smashing, out-of-nowhere success.  Rush very effectively switched to a  lighter, more melodious musical approach.  Also, Neal Pert's lyrics came  down to earth a bit, and Geddy Lee finally realized that sometimes less is  more in terms of singing (*Note: I wish Michael Bolton would learn the same  lesson!).  Anyway, there are some wonderful songs on this album, including  the title track, &quot;The Pass,&quot; &quot;War Paint,&quot; and &quot;Red  Tide.&quot;  But, perhaps not surprisingly, it was a last gasp rather than  a rebirth.  Their follow-up to &quot;Presto,&quot; &quot;Roll the  Bones,&quot; was lame, as were all subsequent Rush releases.  This is one  album, though, that anyone could be proud of owning.
6305327084|5.0|This movie is a true gem.  The acting by the entire cast is wonderful, the setting rings true and the script is just right.  Watching this movie, I kept thinking to myself how, even in the face of situations that were  highly implausible and with dialogue that is impossibly polished, the  characters were all believable.  Each character struck me as a real person,  with real motivations and fears and desires.<br />Ms. Portman, with her  precoscious acting, truly steals every scene she is in, but Mr. Hutton is  more than her equal to make their scenes believable, yet not creepy or  disturbing.  My only complaint, in regards to the actors, was Mr.  Rappaport, who was somewhat over the edge.  Nevertheless, I would be lying  if I did not know at least one person like his character.<br />A phenomenal  movie, that is great for guys, girls and couples.  My highest  recommendations.
0679735259|5.0|Though criticized for it sensationalism, Dispatches owes its power to the fact that it is not a mere iteration of the facts of battle, but a bold, and successful, attempt to transport the reader to the moment, leaving one  with the eerie sensation, as the last pages turn, that one has indeed been  &quot;in country&quot;, and is just heading home.<br />It is Herr's ability to  capture the essence of war that led his contemporaries to acclaim  Dispatches the best book written about war, any war, ever.<br />If you are  unfamiliar with the Vietnam War, reading a straightforward primer before  Dispatches will enhance your appreciation for it.

This is the sound of the beating of your  heart, the erratic flashing and pulsing of the illimitable electrical  explosions that drive your neuro-muscular behavior, the indescribably  delicious waves of life that cascade over you with each precious breath.  These four beautiful gentleman somehow merged into a powerfully frank and  expressive musical force that transcends all intellectual, musical, and  poetical forms from which it draws and delivers unadulterated primal  existential truth.  This isn't merely music folks, it's nothing less than  the magical fabric of life itself!

B000002UVZ|5.0|If you read the critics, they cite Murmur or Document as REM's best albums.  But this is one of the few times that the critics are absolutely wrong. There is no question that Murmur is a great album, but it is not as  accessible as Pagent.  And by the time Document came out REM's sound had  become very commercial.  But Pagent lies in that wonderful but exceedingly  rare territory where songs are richly textured and complex but highly  accessible.  Very few bands have ever been able to pull this combination  off.  This combination of complexity plus accessibility make it an album  that can be listened to over and over.  I think its the only album I own  that I've listened to over 100 times, and still find fresh. That's why I  rate it my favorite album, and the most underrated album I know of.

6304609825|5.0|Sleeping Beauty has ALWAYS been my very favorite Disney movie! It's just wonderul! I'm not sure why this is my all- time favorite since I like so many other newer Disney movies that are computer generated and technically  advanced  and everything- but over all this one always topped them. I think  that may be because Sleeping Beauty is my favorite fairy tale as well.   Also this movie has a charm  and a sweetness that is heart warming and  simple. Besides- doesn't every girl dream of those kind of fairy tales-   happily ever after with your very own Prince Charming? And I think that  somehow we are able to partially live those dreams through movies like  this.  This old favorite is still a favorite today!
B000002H6C|4.0|Every once in a while, maybe two or three times a year, I find myself stuck in a certain mood that necessitates listening to \\"... And Justice for All\\" everyday for a week straight. I don't consider myself a speed-metalhead by any stretch of the imagination (in fact, this is the only speed metal material I own). But there's something about this album that periodically grabs me from my usual alterna-pop-rock/funk-Funk-FUNK listening tastes, and lets me get my aggressions out.<br />From the epic lead guitar lines of \\"Blackened\\", which morphs into its killer opening guitar riff, you know that any delusions of grandeur the band may be harbouring aren't delusions at all. The grandeur is real. For the most part. I find the sudden volume shifts that begin the title track (from ominously clean guitar strums to brawny riffage and back again) almost comical. That being said, the song is a monster. Odd tempo shifts and key modulation underscore impressively aggressive and bleak shake-your-fist-at-the-man lyrics.<br />\\"One\\" is a startling achievement. It simultaneously manages to achieve some semblance of pop-song (dare I say it) beauty, while detailing some pretty tough anti-war imagery. \\"The Shortest Straw\\" is a headbanging burner, crashing and thrashing with no remorse. \\"The Frayed Ends of Sanity\\" takes the introduction's blatant 'Wizard of Oz' rip-off (foreshadowing The Black Album's \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" using the melody from West Side Story's \\"America\\") and turns it into a journey through the psychosis of man's dementia. \\"To Live Is To Die\\" is a great showcase for the band's tight chops. It segues from a lilting intro, through an endless series of heavy sections, to a mid-song near-symphonic interlude, through more crunchy riffs. The vocals (such as they are) finally come in around the seven-minute mark, and are gone in an instant. It is a remarkable achievement, and fully shows the samurai sword-like musicianship that the band wields.<br />The problem I've always had with the album is the flat production. Each song exists only in two-dimensions, and sometimes it's hard to breathe with such a dense concentration of guitar-bass-drums. What happened when Metallica went poppier was not only less of a reliance on eight-minute epics, but a lusher production style, where the distinct instruments could be appreciated on their own.<br />Otherwise, a great sixty-five minute trek through male angst, that leaves me feeling refreshed and cleansed on the other side. Speed metal as catharsis indeed.

0380788624|4.0|In essence this book is predictive historical fiction.  In exploring the 20th century history of cryptography, Stephenson weaves a tale of how the modern computerized world has found itself on the brink of a global  economy.  <br />There are two plots here.  The children of the World War II  cryptography plot are involved in the modern cyber-business plot.   Stephensen ties the two plots together very well.  Secrets revealed in the  World War II plot become plot elements in the modern day plot.  <br />The  modern day plot involves the establishment of a data haven.  Since the book  was published, data havens seem to be emerging in reality.  <br />The  characters are quirky and interesting.  They are not all techno-geeks.   Indeed one of the most interesting is a hoo-rah marine.  <br />One word of  caution.  This book belongs, in part, to the 20th century magical realism  school.  There are mystical plot elements and a magically wise character  that spans the plots.  Perhaps a better phrase, considering the  technological focus, would be mechanical realism.  (If you did not like the  &quot;drummer&quot; part of The Diamond Age, you will be bothered by these  elements.) <br />In all, I heartilly recommend this book for the strength of  its writing and for the freehand manner in which ideas are splashed acros  the pages.
6304510861|5.0|For many of you who saw Lost Highway, the meaning and interpretation of  the film has eluded you.  If you are anything like me, you spent hours  reviewing the movie, thumb on the pause button, notebook in lap!  The  beauty of the film truly lies in it's mystery.  It is a work of art, and as  with any artistic expression, the piece is left open for interpretation by  all.  Each persons opinion or conclusion neither being right or wrong.  My  original ideas included comparing Renee Madison/Alice Wakefield (Patricia  Arquette) to a modern day Eve, working with the devil/mystery man (Robert  Blake) as she lured the men in the movie into sin.  My other major theory  was that the main characters in the movie at one point sold their souls to  the devil, and he held total control over their fate, drawing them into his  den and forcing them to do his dirty work, i.e. porn, murder, etc.<br />Well,  my interpretations were all well and good, but I was interested in what was  going through the mind of David Lynch and Barry Gifford when they wrote the  movie.  I did a little research, and this is what I found...<br />Night  People<br />The idea for this movie came to David Lynch while reading a book  by Barry Gifford called Night People.  In the book, Barry uses the term  \\"lost highway\\" and those words sparked an idea in David's head.  From this  early point, David knew he wanted to make a movie about the unknown.  He  contacted Barry, and they set out to write the movie.<br />Murder<br />If any of  you are wondering if Fred actually killed Renee, the answer is yes.  Fred  lived in constant fear of loosing Renee, constant fear that she was  cheating on him, and most importantly, constant fear of her past.  He loved  Renee, but at the same time hated her.  Whenever he saw her, he saw her  past.  Sex with Renee was a torturous reminder of her experience in porn,  making it impossible for him to even finish.  Eventually, he just snapped.   If you watch the movie again, pause it atthe point where he  watches the  final video tape, and jog slowly over the portion where we see Renee's  body.  You will see what kind of anger and rage exploded inside Fred when  he killed her.  Her torso is ripped apart, her upper and lower body are  completely separated and her hand is cut off and lying on the bed.   Continue to jog slowly and you will see Fred stare directly into the camera  with a piercing, maniacal gaze.<br />Psychogenic Fugue<br />Psychogenic fugue is  an existing mental condition in which the subject, wanting to escape  reality, creates a new reality inside their head.  The person will create  new friends, a new job, a new home, everything.  Pretty much the entire  movie takes place within Fred's head.  When the movie opens, Fred has  already killed Renee and he starts creating an alternate reality.  He  infuses his own reality with tiny portions of the truth, so some of what we  see is actually based on fact, but the majority is what Fred is creating  inside his own head.  A very important line in the movie is when Fred and  Renee are explaining to the police why they don't own a video camera.  Fred  says he doesn't like them, that he \\"would rather remember things his way,  not necessarily the way they happened\\"  <br />When Fred is imprisoned, his  mental illness kicks into high gear.  He is on death row, and any hope of  escaping his nightmare (his real life) is lost.  He is stuck in this cell  until his death.  His only way out is to completely escape to a new  reality.  This is when he essentially snaps and in his own mind, he takes  on a new identity, Pete.  The rest of the movie is him trying to live a  life he finds more attractive.  He is a young, good-looking guy, who has no  trouble getting any woman he wants.  Then he meets Alice (a now blonde  Patricia Arquette), his alternate version of Renee.  <br />But, Fred is so  sick, that even in the reality that he is creating, Alice becomes a product  of his paranoia, eventually turningon him, declaring \\"you will never have  me\\" while they are having sex and then getting up and walking away.  This  is the point in the movie, in the desert, when Fred decides to abandon this  alternate reality and he reappears and Pete disappears. <br />The last scene  of the movie is Fred being chased by the police down the highway as he  begins to transform again, just like in the prison cell.  This reality  didn't quite work out the way he wanted it to, and now he is out there  somewhere, living a new life again.  Let's hope this one worked out for  him! &amp;#61514;<br />Robert Blake<br />The mystery man is truly the most  fascinating aspect of this movie.  In my opinion, he is Fred's idea of the  devil.  He has supernatural powers and he feeds off the sins of mortals.   The scene at the party is one of the creepiest movie scenes I've seen, yet  at the same time it is hilarious.  The way the music and party noise fade  when the mystery man and Fred walk up to each other created a bizarre and  surreal exchange.  Another great scene of the movie is when Mr. Eddy and  the mystery man call Pete together.  \\"Yeah Pete, I just wanted to jump back  on and let you know I'm glad your ok!\\"  Click.  That was great.  And of  course, I can't talk about the great scenes in the movie without mentioning  the \\"tailgating\\" scene.  Robert Loggia (Mr. Eddy) is a  master.<br />Conclusion<br />Keeping in mind David's use of psychogenic fugue as  the main characters mental illness, the movie is actually very simple.   Watching the movie again, keeping this all in mind, is an entirely new  experience.  The first several times I watched it I was intrigued by the  puzzle.  Now, watching the movie, I can relax, stop trying to figure out  how everything relates to everything else, and watch what is actually  happening.  I suggest, if you are a fan of the movie and haven't seen it in  a while, or if you learned some new things here, then go back and watch it  again.  You will realize more than ever that David Lynch is brilliant, a  master of the avant-garde.

Bryson's account of the land down under (from  an undoubtedly American perspective) is the best I have ever read. The book  is also filled with hilarious episodes, fascinating history, and tips on  which cities to see and which to avoid. One could easily plan a trip of  their lifetime based just on the experience and insight in this book.
0783222955|5.0|I first saw this wonderful movie after rushing out to buy the novel to read before the movie finally came out later in the summer. I was just a teenager still in high school, but immediately loved the movie, which I  have seen countless times since. Gregory Peck is probably the single  greatest reason for the movie's smashing success, although the entire cast  does a terrific job in bringing this momentous story to the screen.  In  today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to how explosive,  provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape was in the early  1960s when the movie hit the screens. Yet despite the sizzling if subdued  sexual content and the divisive issues surrounding the movie, it quickly  became the movie of the year, winning Peck the Oscar for his incredible  portrayal of rural southern lawyer Atticus Finch.<br />No doubt it is the  character of Atticus Finch who deserves most of the credit for the novel's  enduring popularity. Seldom has such a quietly heroic figure been so  favorably and memorably described in such loving detail in an American  novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the highly principled and somewhat  befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level best to raise his two young  children alone in the midst of the deep South during the early years of the  Depression. As daughter Scout remembers, there was little that Atticus  couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And, as played by Gregory Peck,  this thoughtful, moral, and courageous man became a model of modern  American manhood for all who read or watched his story unfold. Of course,  the other characters are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described,  and the way in which the importance and relevance of the mockingbird  parable is sown into the web of the story at a number of different levels  with a number of different characters is also one of the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book.<br />Whether considering Tom Robinson,  Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place. Indeed, we watch with growing affection as  Atticus increasingly relies and depends on their black governess, and are  amazed by the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well. On  the other hand, we watch as Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat people of  color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment of human  beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any particular  place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the characters  of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To Kill A  Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely seen  and appreciated as a modern American classic.cout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we all come to better  understand the ways in which all the individuals' stories and fate are  intricately and inextricably interwoven with each other and into the fabric  of a particular time and place.

0061020710|5.0|If you're a fan of Douglas Adams, then I heartily recommend Terry Pratchett.  &quot;The Color of Magic&quot; was his first Discworld novel, and while not necessary to understanding the rest of the series, it helps  you to understand the history and background of Discworld, and is a great  read in and of itself.  Pratchett has an irreverent sense of humor than  fans of British humor should appreciate.  The story revolves around  Rincewind, the worlds worst magician, who can't seem to remember any  spells, Twoflower, the world's first tourist, who looks at the world  through rose colored glasses, and his Luggage.

B000025SUE|5.0|A great artist is one whose talent is growing just as much at the end of his career as at the beginning. At the end of a life of unparalleled mental and physical debauchery Chet Baker created music with everything he had  left in him and nothing less. His tempo is incredibly slow and the music  laid back so far you almost think he's going to sleep. But that's the point  - the art that he had all of his life - the amazing tightrope that he  walked with his timing. He combined his sense of time and rhythm with an  old man's emboucher and voice and made some of the best music of his  career.
044100590X|5.0|This is a lousy sci-fi book. There is no space travel, no robots, practially no aliens, ray guns, space ports or any advanced technology whatsoever. However, it's essentially the best story to fit into just one  book I've been fortunate enough to encounter. The plot takes you to a  distant world, far separated from us in both time and space, to the home of  the Atreides family. They are nobles of some sort and have been comissioned  by the Emperor to govern the planet of Arrakis, home of the mysterious  spice, a substance with many miraculous traits. From here the book brings  you right into the intricate plots surrounding the family Atreides and  their adversaries, all surrounded by an environment that speaks more of the  middle ages than the future.  <br />Well, I would be lying if I didn't admit  that every now and then an ornithopter or a las-pistol enters the scene  (alright, there _are_ ray guns), but this only serves as a backdrop to the  vivid characters of the book, in my opinion the strongest side of the book.  I grew attached to them from the first line they appeared and I felt close  to them all the way through the story.  <br />If you havn't read this book  already, I suggest you pick it up right away. I've yet so talk with any  litterate person who didn't at least think it a fair read. If you've read  it before, I still recommmend you buy this particular printing. It's nicely  set on good paper with a very stylish cover. Personally, I think I'll  schedule it for another reading in a year or so.
0790734060|5.0|Amadeus is not just a movie for fans of his music, or for Academy Award collectors, it is a film for everyone. Children may not be easily included, since it has some adult language. But otherwise it is a masterpiece. Milos  Forman has made this film not just a historic/biographical/comedic and dark  film, it is an inner look into jealousy and mediocrity. The real star is  not Mozart but Salieri, who is &quot;looking from inside the bars of the  cage of genius.&quot; Salieri is tortured and made insane because for  years, his music goes into oblivion while Mozart's lives on for ages. It is  sad, we sympathize with him and are horrified by him. This film is'nt  entirely factual in some respects.. but it is in many. Mozart did have an  affair with an opera singer, there are speculations about the Salieri  incident and he was commisioned a Requiem by someone mysterious. It is  entertaining. Hear the music.. laugh (it is funny ) Frau Webber is a riot  as his mother in law. Wonder on poor Salieri's fate and be awed by the  music of a legend. Get the soundtrack... Fantasy Records with the Great Sir  Neville Marriner conducting.

It is a fairly short story about a man travelling in extremely cold conditions who falls in a creek and, in order to stay alive, has to build a  fire.  It by itself is a great story, but along with &quot;White Fang&quot;  and &quot;The Call of the Wild,&quot; this is just an excellent book for  anyone who likes life and death struggles and, well, dogs and wolves.
B00004THAY|2.0|I'll start by saying, yeah, this album is alright.  But, saying this is the best album from either musician is absurd.  First of all, for the most part, this is NOT a blues album.  There are far too many pop leanings for  this to be a real blues album.  If you want blues from Clapton, get  &quot;From the Cradle.&quot;  If you want it from B.B. get &quot;Live at  the Regal&quot;, &quot;The Best of B.B. King Vol. 1&quot;, or even the  recent &quot;Blues on the Bayou&quot;, but do not get this.  Yes, the  remakes are of great songs, but they hold nothing on the originals.  And I  wish they did just keep it simple.  I've been looking forward for some time  to hearing these two get together, maybe drums and bass, maybe a hammond.   But they have to go full out (like Clapton always embarrasingly does) and  include all the doofy keyboards and session players that really aren't much  more than gratuitous.  However, neither of the stars are exactly peaking at  this point either.  Clapton's voice is almost embarrasing, he just doesn't  cut it as a convincing blues singer, doesn't have the boom or the growl.   He really ought to have stuck to guitar.  B.B. (and as a huge fan of his,  it pains me to say this) is slowly becoming more of a ballad singer than  the gutsy blues man that sang &quot;Don't Answer the Door&quot; so many  years ago.  His guitar playing doesn't have all the punch it once had.  He  seems like he's really settling into routines now.  I've seen him live  twice in the last year, and he just doesn't have the energy he used to when  everything he sang was seminal.  I mean, &quot;Marry You&quot;?  C'mon  guys.  For shame.  The album has so many bright spots of inspiration, but  then they're deflated by some lousy pop injection.  Clapton produced the  album, that's where those come from.  Everyone seems to be obsessed with  the fact that this &quot;blues&quot; album has gone to the top of the  charts.  Sad state of affairs when this is thought of as the best blues  album or even best album ever.  Even sadder, perhaps, is that I think this  review will change anyone's mind.  Hey, if you want to hear real electric  blues, get anything B.B. did for Bihari or up until 1966, go for MAGIC SAM  (my personal fave), Jimmy Rogers, Robert Jr. Lockwood, or Sonny Boy  Williamson.  But, if you want a pretty little pop-blues album that will  allow you to ignorantly say (as so many do) &quot;I've heard a blues album.   I know blues.&quot; then by all means, purchase this.  It's difficult to  put B.B. down like this, he's such a hero to me, but this album warrants  it.  He's made worse, but he's made a WHOLE LOT BETTER.
0783237979|5.0|I recently rented the video and my daughters (12 and 10) and I watched it about 4 times in two days (my girls watched it more). They finally convinced my 11 year old son to watch it and he enjoyed it also (although  he was embarrassed to watch it around me!). My daughters loved Jacob Brent  as Mr. Mistoffolees (&quot;Presto!&quot;) as well as Munkustrap, Vicoria  and the Rum Tum Tugger. Oh yes, and Skimbleshanks, Mungojerrie and  Rumpleteazer, and....Well, they really loved the whole thing. They watched  the credits after every viewing so they could catch all the names of the  cats (even the chorus cats). I saw Cats on Broadway in 1988 (age 21) and  was enthralled. My husband hated it and I know other folks who hate it but  I say...pooh. It isn't meant to be high art. Just really great  entertainment. I doubt  T.S. Eliot meant for his book of poems to be any  more than entertainment for fellow feline lovers. I wish Cats was still  playing on Broadway so I could take my kids. I will have to wait for it to  come back to Providence. We can't wait to get the DVD for the extra  features!

In the ultimate  paradox, we find out that it is John's best friend (Michael Bein) who is  actually John's father.<br />Ok, we're in the second movie and now  Schwarzenegger is one of the good guys, sent to protect John as a child as  the T-1000 (a morphing bit of liquid metal that can take on any form) comes  to kill John as a child since the attack on his mother didn't work.<br />The  plot has a billion holes in it... why didn't they just send back a  termiator back to the 1800's a kill John's great, great grandfather  instead. It would have been impossible for people of that time period to  have a defense against the terminator. The terminators have to use the time  machine in the nude, even though they're entirely metal on the inside...  sorry folks, that's just stupid. I could go on all day about  inconsistencies in the story, but I'm still giving this film 5 stars.<br />The  action is so fast and the acting so believable, it's not until after the  movie is over that you even notice these inconsistencies. This movie  abounds with special effects eye candy, exploding cars and tons of bullets  and fight scenes.  This movie will never get old. I've watched it several  times and it never ceases to be entertaining. This series really opened up  a new genre in sci-fi &amp; action and in many ways it's timeless. Edward  Furlong presents the most convincing performance of a troubled youth who  has grown up without a male role model and looks up to the loyal, yet  emotionless terminator who has come to rescue him and his mother.<br />There  is a lot of violence and tons of language, so this isn't recommended as a  family film... but for sci-fi, special effects junkies, this movie fills  the bill.a lot of violence and tons of language, so this isn't recommended as a  family film... but for sci-fi, special effects junkies, this movie fills  the bill.

0790729989|1.0|I was in angst how to rate this film... my knee-jerk reaction was to give  it 5 stars because of the realistic portrayal of a sick serial killer and  the incredible acting by every member of the cast.  The film was finely  filmed and put together and the acting was flawless, but on the overall  star meter I have to ask myself, &quot;Would I ever recommend this film to  anybody, anywhere, under any circumstances?&quot; And the resounding answer  is &quot;No!&quot;<br />I saw it a few years ago when so many people made  such a big deal on how good it was. And good it was indeed, but it has to  be one of the most sick, disturbing films I have ever seen. I continued to  ask myself, &quot;Why?&quot; Why would anyone feel compelled to make a  movie like this?  It offers no solutions, no social redeeming values, it  doesn't educate, it just reviles and sickens and brings out the worst in  humanity.  I've seen some sick &amp; twisted films before, but never have I  felt so covered with mind filth as when I finished watching this horrific  nightmare of a tale that is too real in light of today's violent society.<br />Kevin Spacey is bone-chilling as he portrays the sick serial killer who  is out to dispense judgement to those who commit the seven deadly sins. His  twisted, perverted mind is very like that of a real serial killer who has  their own perception of right and wrong, not realizing how deceived they've  become.<br />The search to find the killer keeps you on your toes, but the  ending is very predictable and the movie itself is a disgusting heap of  violence, blood, sinew and twisted sexual perversion.  I have got images  dancing around in my head since seeing this film that I can not remove. If  I had known how awful this experience would have been, I would have avoided  the film altogether.<br />Film students and horror &amp; mystery buffs may  still enjoy it (especially if they have cast iron stomachs) and fans of  Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey will not be let down by their masterful  performances -- BUT I feel compelled to warn anyone who has yet to see this  film... THINK, think very long and hard if this is a film you feel like you  can not live without seeing. Frankly, I would have been better off as a  human being had I not seen it, and I certainly could never watch this  again.  To say the least, this is not a film for kids... but in my opinion,  it's not a film for people of any age.be let down by their masterful  performances -- BUT I feel compelled to warn anyone who has yet to see this  film...

He finds a lock of  hair from a young widow's (Karen Allen) dead husband and uses the genetic  material to take on human form.<br />When Jenny (Karen Allen) sees the  visitor, she is cut to the quick. Here is man she loves, but wait... he's  dead!  Jenny finds herself torn in a million directions - she dearly misses  and loves her husband, and his likeness is standing right in front of her,  but she knows it's not really him... at least not on the inside.<br />Despite  the obvious differences, the fact that this alien visitor looks exactly  like her late husband makes her defenses break down little by little so  that she actually begins to see the kindness of the person inside.<br />The  plot changes from her being his captive to becoming his protector from the  government and military fast on their heels and evolves into a romance of  sorts. It's nothing like what you expect, but even the most stony hearted  individual will find this moving and endearing.<br />The ending is  unforgettable and something you'll want to see over and over again. This is  definitely John Carpenter's best work.
B00003IPFK|5.0|Simply one of the greatest Westerns ever, maybe THE greatest, in the class of Red River, My Darling Clementine, The Searchers, Once Upon a Time in the West, The Wild Bunch, Unforgiven and Mann's Last of the Mohicans (if that  counts as a Western), with a deathless performance by Duvall that  overshadows everything else the first time you see it, until the second or  third time you see it and then you realize just how fine Jones is too.  But  I've been reluctant to replace my video copy with the DVD, given the  controversy about the DVD's quality (though I've been seriously flirting  with buying it anyway because the film's so great and the video was never  that technically terrific in the first place, and sooner or later the  videotape will disintegrate...) and now I have more a question than a  review, that maybe someone out there can answer:  it appears from the above  date now listed as the release date for the DVD version that the DVD that  was released last February has perhaps been pulled from the market with a  new release set for October.  Is this the case?  Does anyone know why?  Are  they imporving the quality of the disc after all the flack on it?

His  acting is exquistite as the tortured soul who longs after his lost love and  lusts after the taste of human blood.<br />Post-Lagosi vampires in cinema have  always seemed to get the best of the good guys, but in this film taken from  Stoker's 19th century novel, good does triumph over evil. Copola endeavored  to stick with older cinema effects and he did a superb job. There are some  scenes that you will never forget ... a marriage between simple effects and  creativity gone wild... especially when the elder count's shadow  acts on  its own accord. More suave than gory, but there is gore... this is the best  production of the tale of Dracula since the invention of color film.  If  Anne Rice's spin on the vampire tale is more your speed, this film will  probably not be up your alley. Violence and sexual inuendo make this a film  not suitable for kids.
0393037010|5.0|The first in Patrick O'Brian's twenty-volume \\"Aubrey-Maturin\\" series, \\"Master and Commander\\" is both a compelling narrative and a fine foundation for the books to follow.  In the first decade of the nineteenth century,  British naval officer Jack Aubrey is promoted to his first command of a  warship, the sloop \\"Sophie\\".  He befriends an eccentric physician, Stephen  Maturin, and convinces him to sail as ship's surgeon.  What follows is a  sort of odyssey, a linear narrative as the Sophie cruises the  Mediterranean, capturing cargo ships and fighting French and Spanish  warships.  O'Brian has a wonderful, mature prose, a spare style that omits  repetitious detail while allowing characters and events to describe  themselves and leaving the minutiae to the reader's imagination.  His  complete ease with nineteenth century maritime affairs, from the idiom to  the equipment is wholly convincing, yet never patronizing.  Readers  familiar with neither the sea nor the era will be swept along for the ride.  Aubrey is heroic, but three-dimensional.  He is flawed and sometimes  unlikable, courageous yet occasionally frustratingly inept.  Other  characters are drawn with equal attention to detail and humanity.  This is  a fine book, a wonderful sea story.  Norton's newly-released edition of the  entire series is attractive, and the books continue to please.
B000002KKS|5.0|With Ozzy out of the picture and fans left hanging, wondering &quot;What's going on?,&quot; 75% of the band needed something more than a jump-start to get the band back on an even keel.  If you believe that a 10, 000 amp  electric shock constitutes a &quot;jump-start,&quot; then this 1980 release  is sure to please.<br />Ronnie fills the void perfectly.  His tone and range  meld eerily with the sludgy, darkness-driven energy of Black Sabbath.  The  title track is a seven-minute sludgefest that builds from a mellow stroll  through the meadows to a blistering assault upon Hellgates.  Power ballads  &quot;Children of the Sea&quot; and &quot;Lonely is the Word&quot; reveal  an all-too-rarely-seen side of the earlier Black Sabbath that serves as an  essential counterpoint to the incredibly heavy framework that made the Sabs  famous.  &quot;Neon Knights,&quot; &quot;Wishing Well,&quot; and &quot;Die  Young&quot; are the obligatory speedsters, even though the latter is  reminscent of Queen (?).  Filler is present in the forms of only two songs,  &quot;Lady Evil&quot; and &quot;Walk Away.&quot;  Ironic, isn't it, that  both of these middle-of-the-road tracks deal with rebellious or otherwise  unorthodox women?<br />All in all, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; is the album  that helped Black Sabbath regain the past glory, and they managed to hold  onto said glory for a total of four years, before everything fell apart on  &quot;Seventh Star.&quot;
B00002MZ2C|4.0|This CD wasn't as great as i thought it would be. You'd probably be better off with their first self titled cd. The stand out tracks i thought were testify and sleep now in the fire. The others are just a big blur to me.  enjoy.
0446677450|3.0|I took the book out of the library (as a previous reviewer suggested).  There are many how-to-get-rich books in print.  All of them seem to take one or maybe two ideas that could be part of an over all strategy and base  the whole book on them.  This book isn't really any different.  It isn't a  comprehensive investment guide.  It's a couple of good ideas immersed in a  great deal of motivation.  Motivation is great, but hard facts are what's  needed to keep you going after the motivation wears off.  This book is  scant on them.  If you need something to get you going, then great, this is  the book for you.  If you need something to keep you going (like actual  financial advice) after the euphoria of trying to strike it rich wears off,  then look for some solid financial planning books.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Although this CD is a lot more rap than thier first cd, it still has some heavy riffs.  like break stuff (although it is very overrated) is a pretty good heavy song. And n 2 gether now (featuring method man as if u didn't  already know) is an alright rap song (with the over use of the F word which  made it popular oddly enough) so  suggest this CD be bought but don't  expect it to be too heavy.
B000001Y79|5.0|This CD is definatly one of my favriote CDs of all time. The music is catchy and happy and it makes you want to get up and dance! I love evert song from Spider Webs and the ballad, Don't Speak, to Excuse me Mr. and the  title track, Tragic Kingdom. Believe me his is No Doubts best album of all  time! If you like ska, oh hell if you llike music in general buy this CD!  Really it's that good!
B000002NFM|5.0|This is one of the greatest electronic cd's I've ever heard. The only track on here that i didn't find that great was mindfields which is also on the matrix soundtrack. Some of my absolute favorites on this are Diesel  power, serial thrilla, Firestarter, and Breathe. I hope whoever buys this  CD likes it just as much as i did.
B00000BKE0|3.0|Because of &quot;Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot; and &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, this CD is worth buying if you can find it Used or in the bargain bin.  These are 3 very good songs that are underrated  because they happen to be on a very subpar album.  The production on this  album is also very good.  Unfortunately the rest of the songs on here are a  waste of time.  They range from boring to purposely stupid (&quot;Holy  Smoke&quot;? ).  Program tracks 1, 7 &amp; 10 and then go listen to a  better Maiden CD like &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much. Although i lot of people are crying about how they sound different and they sold out a bit (which i also find true) we just gotta live with it.  Some of the songs i enjoyed were pretty fly for a  white guy, kids aren't alright, feelings, y don't u get a job, walla walla,  and she's got issues.  I hope u can handle their somewhat new sound unlike  some other weiner reviewers and enjoy this cd like i did.
B00001ODHH|5.0|See this? This...IS THE FUNNIEST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN!  Ol' Bruce is supberb in this film, which is a nice welcome due to the seriousness of the last two. I recommend this film to anybody who wants a quick laugh. GROOVY.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is pretty good despise the losers who just listen to all the small things and adam's song non stop.  There are much better songs on the CD like the party song (kinda crazy), and goin away to college, and what's my  age again. I like adam's song and all the small things is ok but when  people cry everytime they here adam's song or think all the small things  should get a grammy and dumb stuff like that it makes the band look bad. i  wonder what ever happened to their old style?

0448060191|5.0|When I was a little girl, I didn't read very much, so I read this book the first time as a teenager.  I don't think I would have liked it so much, if I hadn't.  It was the first novel I'd read in a long time, and has been my  favorite book ever since.  The movies don't do it justice.
B00003CX6P|5.0|THIS MOVIE SCARED ME. I WATCH ALOT OF HORROR MOVIES, BUT FOR SOME REASON THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE SCARIEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN. WHEN TOM HIT'S JUDE LAW'S CHARACTER IN THE FACE WITH A OAR. NOW THAT WAS SICK. RENT THIS  MOVIE
0375707972|5.0|I found this book absolutely beautiful.  The story left so much for the imagination.  I just found it so romantic in a way, yet sad at the same time.  This book changed my way of thinking.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This Movie was a suprise, and it is one of the best movies i saw in a long long time. but acording to the rules , I can't talk about the movie..  :-)   well worth your time to see this one..
B00000JGEH|3.0|I saw this film in 1984 when it came out, and now own it on video, despite the fact that this is one of the worst films plotwise I've ever seen.   The character development (there is none) really doesn't get you going.   If  you're willing to put aside the fact that we're supposed to root for Linda  Hamilton, who's an inept waitress, or the stereotypical black cop handling  the investigation, or the weird roommate who never takes off her Walkman,  the action still somehow manages to keep you going.  At points it's just  too easy.  You sit and think at the end, why didn't they just do this in  the first place?   Still, for some reason I like this film, and chances are  you will, too.
0671034065|3.0|I loved Mr. Perfect until the first murder.  It went downhill from there.  Sam and Jaine were funny and sexy.  Jaine was very realistic with her attempts to stop cursing.  The list, however, would not in real life  generate such buzz.  I found that part very unrealistic.  I would've  preferred more jaine and sam sparring.  They got together way too fast.  I  reccommend the first half only.  Then put it down.
6305627347|5.0|It boggles my mind how many people have been offended by this film and even walked out of it at the theater. This film is one of the best satires I've ever seen.  At a time when Hollywood comes under fire for poisoning  the minds of children (which to a large extent,I too believe) takes the  issue and goes to the extremes.   Every possible sacred cow in 1999/2000  America is taken on.  The fact that these cartoon characters use foul  language too often scares away people who really should sit and examine  what it is the film is trying to say.  Also, the songs in the film are  surprisingly well-written.  And here I'm talking Rodgers and Hammerstein  quality, even though the lyrics may sound at first like they were written  in a men's locker room. Songs are well-integrated into the plot.  I didn't  stop laughing when I watched this film and you probably won't, either.
6305358567|4.0|'Elizabeth' is a movie along the lines of 'Braveheart'- a fantastic spectacle that plays fast and loose with the historical facts in order to make a good show.  Although I found it sorely lacking in the historical  accuracy department, the mood, feel, scenery, costuming and lighting come  close to atoning for that.<br />Taking place at the inception of Elizabeth I's  reign, you're transported back to Elizabethan England.  We're privy to some  of Elizabeth's most intimate moments, and watch as she grows into an unsure  young girl into a competent ruler, who ultimately becomes one of England's  greatest monarchs.  <br />The acting is superb, save for an over-the-top  portrayal of a middle-aged, ill and hysterical Queen &quot;Bloody&quot;  Mary.  Cate Blanchett eerily resembles the real Elizabeth, and delivers  what should have been an Oscar-winning performance.  The supporting cast  does an admirable job as well, and all should be congratulated for the  apparent ease with which they endured being attired in Elizabethan-period  clothing!<br />All in all, the scenery is fantastic, the costumes  breathtaking, the music haunting, and the acting first-rate.  The only  thing which I found annoying is the disregard for real history- which, in  this instance, is even more compelling than the 'fact based fictional  movie'.  Some stories need embellishment; that isn't the case with  Elizabeth's.  Yet despite that, this movie stands on its own and shouldn't  be missed.
0800185218|5.0|Be thankful there's a cleaner, crisper picture than in previous versions of the film, because the poor quality of the earlier prints takes away from the enjoyment of the film.  They don't make films like this anymore, but  they should.  Each of the main characters is very well-defined and  well-acted, as you watch the British and Japanese commanders in a clash of  wills, and the American POW who comes back to destroy the bridge adds an  extra twist of suspense.  Good storytelling, good direction and acting.   Great film.
B00003CX6P|4.0|This movie was definitely a shocker ! It was absolutely not what I expected. Was this good ? Yes and no.Here's the good part:  The previews and ads led me to believe it was another typical film about someone  assuming the identity of another for wealth, power and the girl.I was under  the impression that Ripley was not only after Dickie Greenleaf's life but  his girlfriend as well.Instead, Ripley has another hidden agenda. For those  who have not seen the film, I refuse to divulge what Ripley's real sinister  intentions are ! <br />The bad is that the film ended with a feeling of an  unsatisfying closure. However, I'm sure it was done so as not to follow the  all too typical ending where the villain gets his just rewards ! It almost  had an undertone sub-plot feeling of Single White Female as well with a  Hitchcock twist...
B00003CXFU|4.0|We remember Julia Roberts for her megawatt smiles in Pretty Woman and romantic comedies like My Best Friend's Wedding. But never has she been  more feisty, intelligent in the gritty Erin Brockovich and with director  Steven Soderbergh from Out of sight, the movie is glossed up with excellent  cinematography from Ed Lachman, a strong and sexy plot, and stauch  supporting cast. No doubt, the star vechicle is Roberts in which she play  an intelligent waitress who sue a company and summoned an astounding  compensation for toxic pollution in which contamination plagued the town of  Hickley, California. There she emerged to be the talking point by beating  against corporate dominion. <br />Julia Roberts hones her acting and has never  been better. No doubt her megawatt smiles are put to good use for this one,  with those moulding apparel to flaunt boldly her figure. But behind the  cloak of independence lies a resonant human drama. Roberts faces the  breakdown of her family as a single, raising her children, and there in  lies a pillion rider neighbor Albert Finney and her refreshing chemistry  with George in the attorney firm.<br />It is her affection, her will and  strength that bolsters the drama and Roberts handles the emotional scenes  with maturity. It is a believable drama which explores the human heart, the  triumph against evil and the vulnerable woman's center. The video release  makes it a must-watch and is definitely a keeper. You cannot miss Erin  Brockovich.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Eminem does it all in this album. It's definitely the sickest album I bought yet. He straight out says what he wants and doesn't [care] what anyone thinks about it. He even puts deep messages in his songs. He  critizises himself and disses anyone who just happens to come across his  mind. Some his songs like 'Kim' can shake you up so much you wake up at  night havin' nightmares. He does what he does in such a way that, even if  you are not a particular fan of Hip Hop you should check it out. Although  as bad as he disses homosexuals, some women and his fans he mentions 'relax  guys, i like gay men' , 'half the stuff i say i say just to make u mad' and  'i'm just playin' ladies, u know i love u' in his songs. He talks about his  life and how he can't stand being blamed for every little crime someone  else commits and mocks his prosecuters. He centers all his anger into his  music and Slim Shady comes to show in his music. When he puts a message in  his songs he turns into Marshall Mathers again. Eminem puts his part down  as the rapper who is totally crazy and straight out doesn't [care]  what his fans his family or the law thinks. Swiching around between these  alter ego in his songs makes it even more interesting to see which  Character will be represented next. So check it out even if you normally  don't listen to Hip Hop.
0679720200|5.0|If we set the  reference point of judging books on the effect that they have on the readers life then this book is the book of all books.<br />I read this book when I was 20 years old as a freshman. I was still searching for  the meaning of life (still do) , my place in the world and also a light at  the end of the tunel that I could follow. And man, what a blast..... It  took me half a year to overcome it. I lost interest in life, I became so  passive and numb that nothing really mattered. I almost dropped out of  school. Camus book reveiled to me that there are really no answers out  there, no purpose , no treatment and for that reason NO ACTION should be  taken.<br /> All of our agonies and strugles for the truth of our existence  that we desperetaly radiate to our universe just simply bounce back. There  is noone out there to answer.And for that reason our existence itself has  no meaning. It is absurd (paralogos in Greek) !<br /> I guess I took every  word of the book literally. Now, after many years from the first reading I  have come to terms with the absurdity of life, I know that there is nothing  that I can do, but at least I will try to live a good life whatever that  means. The book in retrospect made me a little bit wiser but I cant afford  to follow it. It is self destructing.<br />So be careful with this book, it  could be a time bomb. That is the magnitude of its brilliance. A  masterpiece.
B00003CXAR|1.0|I have a Sony DVP-CX850D and a Harmon Kardon 750, both DTS compatable. When I try an select the audio channel it only plays 2.0 and not 5.1 DTS. There is something wrong with this dvd!

I'm talking abou the fact,that finally we have a blues album at the top of Amazon's ranking.And...what an album!   The world now,have the privilege to hear one of the most  exciting,sensual...hot rythm of music ever created...THE BLUES!  With this  sensational album,the 'teacher'B.B. King and his eternal 'pupil'Eric  Clapton,bringed to all us together one of the best blues albuns ever  released,and certainly all of those people that was not familiarizated with  the blues,have now a great chance to be plugged......eternally plugged with  this marvellous rythm!  THE BLUES LIVE!
630451087X|5.0|I often think that David Lynch starts by creating his films by producing the soundtrack, then adding &quot;some visuals&quot; and the story evolves from it in an organic way. This certainly appears to be the case with  &quot;Lost Highway.&quot; If you liked Twin Peaks: Fire walk with Me for  it's general level of weirdness then you'll love &quot;Lost  Highway&quot;<br />The film is more coherant than Twin Peaks - less strange  stuff for the sake of it. The symbolism is much more subtle and grafted  onto the plot. It's a terrifying film, not because there is anything in  there that is gory but it's so quiet, dark and moody that you get an  uncomfortable feeling watching it (now *that's* directing). <br />The story?  Well, it's difficult to explain and makes Dune seem like &quot;The  Waltons&quot; in comparison. As Lynch puts it, it's about a man who  experiences a 'psychotropic fugue' to get away from his current  existance<br />The soundtrack is simply staggering and I don't just mean the  music. Lynch seems like the only director who actually USES sound to his  advantage to tell the story, scare or horrify the audience. The music is  terrific, I bought the album straight after seeing the video, David Bowie,  Angelo Badalamenti all in one.<br />Along with the Twin Peaks movie this is  Lynch's finest work (yes, it's better than Blue Velvet). Make sure you see  it in Widescreen too!
B000002KBH|5.0|Though completely different than their live work, this is undoubtedly the Dead's best studio venture.  Listing greatest hits from the album would be futile; they're all incredible.  A must-have.
B00000JJQK|5.0|Although the choice of 'greatest album ever' is widely debatable and certainly a product of one's subjective determinations, one should isolate the works by themselves and analyize them accordingly. The issue here isn't  whether or not Pets Sounds is a better album than Sergeant Peppers or vice  versa, one would be doing a great diservice to both musical sides. Let the  albums stand alone, take them for what they are worth at face value as  opposed to what one's allegiances dictate. With that aside one will be able  to fully realize and appreciate art at the top of its form.
B00003Q438|5.0|The Abyss is probably James Cameron's most underrated and greatest film. Not only did he direct the impossible senario of an almost complete underwater film, he also managed to show one of most intense character  films in recent history.<br />Rather than focus on the &quot;aliens&quot; as  the monsters or threat of the movie, Cameron instead showed what  monster-like qualities humans posess. It wasn't what people wanted at the  time. They thought they were going to get another &quot;Aliens&quot;  underwater. But as you gradually take in this film, you realize it has ten  times the intensity of &quot;Aliens&quot;.  Please, please, please get the  DVD version so you can see the Director's Cut of The Abyss. It is nearly 3  hours in length, but adds so much more to the story then before. This is  one of the gretest movies ever made, and should be viewed the way Cameron  cut it on the special edition.<br />PS. Ask any fan of the film. This movie  has quite possibly the most intense, well acted scene in movie history.  Once you see it you'll know.
B000002UB6|5.0|The &quot;Let It Be&quot; Project wanted to show the world how a band made an LP.  This was an excellent concept.  Unfortunately, Apple Management (eh, the Beatles) should have featured a band like Badfinger.  Face it, by  1969, the Beatles weren't the same bunch of loveable mop-tops that they  were in 1964.  Instead of a solid, cohesive unit; the Beatles were very  much into their own genre.  Sadly, by 1969, the Beatles were only a  &quot;pro forma&quot; band.  The movie &quot;Let It Be&quot; clearly shows  a tired, confused, and; at times, annoyed band trying to recapture past  glories.  &quot;Let it Be&quot; is a very sad movie -- It not only shows  the end of the Beatles.  But, more importantly, it shows the end of a  friendship.  <br />     This now takes us to the Let It Be music.  The story  goes that John Lennon was so thrilled about the work Phil Spector did on  his solo LP, that he gave Spector the tapes for the &quot;Let It Be / Get  Back&quot; sessions.  Phil Spector took some liberties with the LP.   However, most of the tracks are still pretty much unaltered by Spector's  orchestral music.  The fact that the Beatles weren't in the best of moods  during these sessions is a testimony to there greatness -- they managed to  put together a fairly decent LP amidst all the controversy.  <br />The opening  track, two of us, is the last time John and Paul harmonized together.   This, in itself, is a piece of Beatles history.  George's offerings,  &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; and &quot;For You Blue&quot; further show's  Harrison's maturity as a song writer.  &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; is a bit of  a rock-waltz.  &quot;For You Blue&quot; is British Blues that would make  John Mayall take notice.  My favorite track on the whole CD, however, is  Get Back.  This track features a good rock beat, solid performances by all  -- especially Billy Preston, and John's final comment: &quot;. . . .I Hope  We Passed the Audition.&quot;  These words will live on forever as a bit of  rock-n-roll irony.    <br />All right, granted, some of the music on this CD  was nonsense -- such as One After 909 (I always hated that song).  But, for  the most part, this is a worthwhile CD.  No, this is not a &quot;Cardboard  Tombstone&quot; for a great band.  In many respects, &quot;Let it Be&quot;  was a new beginning -- a rebirth -- for John, Paul, Ringo, and George.
6303471714|5.0|This is one of the best work out tapes I've ever used.  It's challenging, fast paced and when you're done the first 45 min workout you'll know that you've done something to change your body's appearance.  I saw slight  changes in my triceps, legs and abs in about a week and a half which  motivated me to do it even more.  One great thing about the tape is that it  offers a short ten to fifteen minute workout for days that you still do  want to work out but are tired or don't have a lot of time.  I highly  recommend this tape to healthy people who want to get their body toned up.   Remember, if it's too hard at first when you're doing all those crunches...  just tell yourself &quot;I'm going to end up looking like Cindy&quot; and  you'll find the strength to keep going.
B000001ES9|3.0|If, like me, you listened to a lot of the other Rush albums before purchasing this one, you may be in for quite a shock. It is VERY different from the classic Rush sound. That is not to say that it is bad, not by any  means. It is just not on the level of classics like 2112, MP, PW, and  Kings. Not that we should expect it to be, of course, it is Rush's DEBUT  album, without Neil. So, although the music is still pretty strong  throughout, the lyrics are not up to par. Instead of the deep meanings we  have the usual testosterone-driven rock songs. So, I will judge the best  cuts by their music: Finding My Way, What You're Doing, and Before and  After are all good songs. But the songs with the extended jam sections,  Here Again, and, of course, Working Man are excellent songs. They show the  musicianship that Rush would later become known for. This is a good ROCK  'N' ROLL album, but, for me at least, Rush really began with Fly By Night.
B000003TAR|5.0|How do you follow up a great album like nevermind?  Make an album the rocks even harder.  I was expecting good, but not that good.  How can you resist rock anthems like &quot;Pennyroyal Tea&quot;  and &quot;All  Apologies&quot;  And &quot;Tourettes&quot;  must be the one of the best  songs ever to bang your head too.  This album contains a lot more guitar  effects such as pick slides and scratches and feedback, which adds to its  destructiveness.  A GREAT ALBUM
B00004SCX6|1.0|Do you think that Britney Spears really has something to say. Other than make someone elses music, and dance someone elses steps what makes her important. I can understand and appreciate the teen idol image, but what is  this saying to impessionable kids. &quot;I'm not that innocent&quot;  indeed. In 5 years no one will care, no one will remember. After she  realizes her choreographer rips off everyone from Michael Jackson to  Madonna (by the way, who are true artists), and after she sings all the  songs probably written by the same guy who does NSYNC and BB (cuz they all  sound the same) she'll realize Hey! I have money and don't need this  anymore. This whole Boy band, teen idol phase we're going through is  nothing more than a special Where Are They Now? episode on VH1 in 5 years.
0446777013|5.0|SUGAR BLUES William Dufty<br /><br />I read this book in 1975 when I was 28 years old.  I had given up sugar for a year (100%) about five years prior to reading this -- which is what prompted the interest.  I had come to the realization that EVERYTHING had sugar in it and I proceeded  to even make my own ketchup (with handy instructions from Weight Watchers  -- in 1971 they were just a mere dot on the map with products only -- no  advertising that I remember).  I used to carry around their salad dressings  so that I could eat out and still maintain my good nutritional habits.<br /><br />I  continue to come across this book on my bookshelf, and have taken up to  reading it again just to see what the inspiration was.  Sugar still  remains in my diet - removing it 100% now would be tough -- even though I  have an excellent health and exercise  regime.  Now, at age 53, even though  I still weigh the same and wear the same size clothes as I did 30 years  ago, I am prepared to cut back again on the excess sugar....it becomes more  difficult to maintain the weight and physique as time goes on, so removing  excess sugar would be a beneficial thing to do right now for my 50+ year  old body.<br /><br />Everyone who loves sugar, knows that once they start eating  (candy, baked goods, etc.) -- i.e., beginning from Halloween and ending  after Christmas, that their system seems to then REQUIRE more and more --  that suddenly eating candy (sugars) everyday becomes a staple diet item.  I see it happen every year, if I don't make a CONSCIOUS decision at the end  of summer to NOT get caught up in the cycle. That approach has worked for  me -- just being constantly aware.  However, after coming across another  review here, I am going to read  \\"Get the Sugar Out...501  Ways....\\" as it sounds like that's what is needed now for inspiration  to continue on my path from 30 years ago.

630518299X|5.0|Jim Carrey in a triumphant performance as a man living his life on an island surrounded by 'actors' who manipulate his life which is broadcast worldwide as a popular TV show.<br />Ed Harris superbly plays the producer of  this show.  He creates a world in which the Truman character is trapped by  his own fears.  This premise produces the film's best satirical moments.   For example Truman must be kept on the island, for the show to continue.   So when Truman heads to a travel agency to inquire about an airline ticket  to Fiji, there are posters of burning planes plummeting from the sky on the  walls.<br />Once Truman begins to figure out that his life is being  manipulated, Carrey shines with a combination of poignancy, manicness, and  a wide range of emotion.  Truman faces a choice of freedom vs security,  self-determination vs fate, and truth vs denial.<br />This role proves that  Carrey's sympathetic and vulnerable roles are funnier and stronger - much  like his earlier role in *The Mask* or Bill Murray in *What about Bob?* or  *Groundhog Day*, as opposed to just being obnoxious.
B00004TH6O|1.0|I am disgusted. This is an atrocious piece of garbage and many have been suckered into the pathetic trap posed by the bands new lable, Interscope records. Is it any wonder why Queens sound so poppy and &quot;Avant  Guard&quot;? Is it any wonder why more people find it (rated R) so  &quot;great&quot; after a bunch of money grubbing honchos at Interscope got  their hands on the Queens? Il tell you what happend, everyone got together  at the company and said &quot;we can't sell the Queens for what they are so  lets put a hodge podge of different styles on the ablum and take the heart  and soul of this band out and turn it into a popular money maker that some  40 year old hipster at rolling stone will condone as inovative and sit back  and enjoy the ride&quot;.      Yes, I know it does not sound like Kyuss but  the funny thing is I did not expect it to be; I expected it to be like the  Queens: inovative hard and bluesy. What I got was a Ween C.D. Yes thats  right if I had to compare this monstrosity of warmed over commercial clap  trap to anything, its the ever ridiculous Ween brothers. Save the dough on  this, go into the 99 cent bin and pick up a Ween C.D. or better yet wait  two years until &quot;Rated R&quot; is in the same bin and pick it up then.        To prove a point, look at all of the comparisons that are being made;  &quot;oh its like old nirvana, screaming trees, pearl jam,. Ect. The great  thing about the band previous to this was you could not compare them to  anything. They were unique and refreshing in a world were every guy who can  play a &quot;C&quot; chord over and over gets a record deal. Now they are  just part of a huge pathetic monster record executives pawn of to 15 year  olds as &quot;cool alternative rock&quot; to turn a quick buck. I'm almost  sad but if this continues, the queens are dead to all that used to love  them. but if you are a 14 year old who has the latest &quot;Our lady  peace&quot; album go for it my man. If you are as heart broken as I am or  want to defend this garbage , email me at Rugbyokb@aol.com I would love to  hear from you
B000002MP2|5.0|In this album which had no less than 5 radio hits, greenday mixes powerful pop/punk riffs with melodic bass lines and great drums.  Dont claim to like rock unless you have this album
6305609691|5.0|This is a visionary film. Rather than showing you the loss of innocence or youth (Platoon/ Full Metal Jacket), this movie begins in madness. The madness of a soldier who has seen too much, and been in the War way too  long.<br />Everyone's performances in this movie are incredible. Sheen is  brilliant in the lead role. Duvall, Brando, and Fishburne are equally  impressive, but it is Hopper who gives the final section of the movie its  bizarre manic state.<br />I can understand why Apocalypse Now is not always  ranked above other fine Vietnam war movies like Platoon. It is simply too  horrific. It's so far detached from what civilians thought happened in  Vietnam that this movie almost appears as a Fantasy. It's a hard movie to  watch but definatley a true cinimatic masterpiece.
6304907648|2.0|Sigourney Weaver is a criminal psychologist terrified into seclusion by a run-in with sicko serial killer Harry Connick Jr. When young women start turning up dead in San Francisco, Weaver is recruited by chipper detective  Holly Hunter and partner Dermot Mulroney to catch the killer, who is  apparently mimicking famous serial murderers. This tense but cold and  reprehensible thriller has as little feeling for the victims as the killer  does; it's just a high-toned slasher flick given unearned weight by  Oscar-winning/nominated actresses. It's nowhere near the same league as  &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; or &quot;Seven,&quot; both of which  were about something other than cat-and-mouse games.<br />Recommended, with  major reservations, for fans of Hunter and Weaver; fans of Connick, on the  other hand, may want to skip this if they want to preserve their image of  him as a nice guy with a smooth voice and a way with the ivories - he's  pretty damn convincing as a vicious redneck psycho, and the way the movie  leaves you with him staring blankly at you for 2 or 3 minutes during the  end credits (it's not a freeze-frame, either) is a bit unnerving. In fact,  his face staring at you is scarier than any of the preceding 2 hours.
B000031XCR|5.0|When I first listen to Celine Dion's voice for the first time I thought she sounded like an Angel; I couldn't get her out of my mind. During this decade we had seen a singer capable of singing in any rhythm, like  when  she sing &quot;Conga&quot; of her dear friend Gloria Stefan in a special  broatcast for Television or &quot; The First time ever I saw your  face&quot; singed by Barbara Streisand several years ago. This new album  brings back her all time favorite hits and incorporate new songs and music  that gets into a new generation of fans that want to listen to a good  singer.
0792838068|5.0|I found this film very hard to watch. Not because it is a bad film but because of the material with which it deals and the strength of the portrayal of that material.<br />Nicolas Cage plays Ben, a man who is on the  way down and who knows it. He loses his family and his job and the only  thing that he has left is drinking. Finally, destroying everything that  remains of his old life, he takes his severance pay and sets off for Las  Vegas with the simple intention of drinking himself to death.<br />There he  has a chance encounter with prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue) and they are  drawn together. All that Ben needs is a person who will not reject him  because he is a drunk and who will not try to get him off the bottle. Sera  needs Ben too. She needs a man who wants her for more than just sex or the  money that it makes.<br />Oddly, for a relationship involving a prostitute,  sex hardly enters into things. The reason is simple. Alcohol is deadening  Ben to the extent that he is not sexually interested in Sera. This is the  one thing that strains their relationship. Ben never asks Sera to stop  working but he makes sure that she knows that he does not like it. Sera  cannot understand how Ben can want to be with her but not want her  sexually.<br />Finally, Sera realises something about Ben. When he told her  that he intended to drink hiumself to death, he was being more serious than  with anything else. She asks him to seek help. This precipitates a string  of events that breaks them up but they are reunited for a tragic finale in  which both finally get what they wanted.<br />Cage puts in a truely  outstanding performance as Ben. Watching him gave me the same feelings that  I have had when watching a friend get too drunk, too often. He really is  totally convincing. Shue is good but her performance is overshadowed by  Cage.<br />The final reason that the film is so compelling is the source  material. The film is based on a book by John O'Brien who killed himself asfilming began. Director, Mike Figgis finished the film as a tribute and  O'Brien's father is reported to have described the story as his son's  suicide note.
B0000024JN|5.0|This very important album broke the Beastie Boys through to mainstream acceptance. This is a minimalist album compared with the heavily textured Beastie Boys albums that followed. <br />What I like about this album, is that  the Boys are talented rappers and musicians and it shines through. Some of  the beats, electric guitar and samples are cheezy but much of the sampling  is very clever. The strongest points of the Beastie boys is here in a very  pure form, great rapping, clever rhyming and integration of the rapping  with the samples. Their syncopated rapping form was heavily influenced by  RUN DMC but had already developed into something new and entirely theirs.  <br />The cheese factor here was due to the sense of Beasties Boys' senses of  irony and humour as well as Rick Rubin's clever production. Fight for your  right for instance was intended as a joke song, but got taken literally by  the masses as a great party song, which was surely Rubin's intention. <br />If  you like the Beastie Boys you have to have this album. It is fascinating  and songs like Paul Revere show off their incredible rapping and rhyming  skills in a minimalist setting.
0385334206|5.0|Vonnegut has pulled off another classic with this one, alongside Cats Cradle, a great book, and others I have yet to read. The author uses Kilgore Trout who he uses also in Timequake, but in &quot;Breakfast&quot;  Trout seems to fit in the story more and the story is more planned and  assembled for this earlier work. But the Trout in this one and Timequake  are both in different universes of the author's invention because trout die  in 1981 in this book but he is alive for the timequake in the 90's.<br />I  like the idea that all characters, major and minor, have equal impact on  the story. The cast of characters makes the story simultaneously funny and  sad.<br />As for the content: I am totally against censorship and  politically corectedness, but being a member of the generation that follows  'X', my brainwashed mind could not help but cringe at some of the phrases  used. Never mind that, though. Everything, the language, the drawings,  everything in the book worked artfully.
0792844939|3.0|Before I saw New York New York, I never knew anything about it! Maybe it's because I am only a teenage girl, or maybe because I am not a huge Martin Scorsese fan.. But I never really knew about it.. and I knew my parents had saw it.. But I never really asked them what was it about.. And one night I  was watching t.v. and it was on! So I decided to watch it.. and I really  did like the beginning.. just watch and see.. Liza Minnelli is a beautiful  actress and her voice is even more beautiful.. and Robert De Niro is a very  talanted man.. But I wanted to kill his character! lol.. (just watch and  see) I did enjoy this movie.. but then I began to lose intrest.. possibly  because the beginning was exciting.. that some how i expected more.. But  the acting is excellent.. and Martin Scorsese's directing was also great..  I think if I might of had a greater intrest to watch it.. I might of  enjoyed it more.. But this movie is worth your time.. and possibly you may  have full intrest through out this movie.. it doesn't hurt to relax, get  confy, and watch it!
B00004TJTS|5.0|A very touching film for all ages.  Great story telling and wonderful acting brings this wonderful tale to life.  A story every one can relate to. From a town hero, who runs away when he was afraid, to a lonely boy who  just needs a friend.  My Dog Skip has everything you every wanted and more.   <br />The picture on the DVD was prefect.  Sound was great.  I love the  deleted scenes (even more heart warming scenes, including one by 'Forest  Gump' author Winston Groom.)  This movie is a sure bet!
B000002TP7|5.0|This album is very special. There is a return here to the Beastie Boys hardcore roots, as well as an exploration of live instruments mixed with rapping. There is also a mellow and even mystical side to band that is  exposed here, they have flute samples and my favourite is the Tibetan  throat singing. I can hardly believe it but despite all the styles involved  in this album it still flows and is listenable all the way throughout. I  found the production of this album great, you can tell that the Boys had a  lot of creative control on the album and really demonstrated their mastery  of music. I love albums like this that break people's preconceptions of  music and styles. <br />This album let the world know that the Beastie Boys  are unclassifiable and can do whatever they want and make it musical. This  is a must have for anyone that can appreciate rapping along side other  styles of music.
0553213105|5.0|One of the best novels I have ever read.  Jane Austen speaks out in mild but effective comical terms on the stupidity of tradition throughout the eighteenth century. Her main themes address the problems of true love,  money and the importance of family life. She does this through the  narrative of her highly regarded heroine Elizabeth Bennett. Through the  love and devotion to her eldest sister we see Elizabeth at her best  fighting for the interests of her family and connections. A wonderful novel  of two sisters and their struggle for true love in a society with pecuniary  worries and stations.
B000031XCR|5.0|Always I thought that the songs need have some meaning to like me. Because I like find a sense in everything  that I do or I heard. The songs of Celine Dion, leave you fly in your mind the most increible feelings.  Feelings about sadness and hapiness to. She interpreted every word with a  force amazing in her voice. I think that she is relly good singer of our  times and have she is  privilege for God. If you dont know her music  still, please, just do it. Go to see the life of the diferent ways, and I  sure, that you will going feel diferent after heard this music and  probably... change your life.
6305910103|5.0|STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN (it didn't have the II in the title when it first came out) is far and away the best Trek film.  William Shatner gives his best performance as Kirk, and Ricardo Montalban is incredible as the  revenge obsessed Khan.  The story is excellent and well paced, mixing small  doses of humor in just the right places.  The special effects are the best  of the series up to INSURRECTION, and Nicholas Meyer's direction is  excellent on all levels. The DVD transfer of the film is beautiful - by far  the best version of the film visually.  Sadly, however, the only extra we  get is the original theatrical trailer (and it's not exactly a spectacular  trailer - I seem to remember another trailer that was better...).  They  should have restored the film to include the footage seen on ABC when they  broadcast the movie back in the 80's.  That version has several extended  scenes that help make certain angles in the story make more sense.  They  also should have done a documentary on the making of the film, like the  documentaries on the James Bond DVD's.  All that may yet happen, but until  then this is still an excellent transfer of the original film, in it's  original theatrical form.  STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN is still most  die-hard Trek fans' pick as best Trek film, and I would agree with that  sentiment.  Even though the lack of extras is disappointing, I would  recommend this DVD to both Trek fans and non-Trek fans alike.  One of the  best Science Fiction films of all time.<br /><br />(Update: An extended edition of Star Trek II ended up released as part of the 2-Disc Star Trek special edition series that Paramount released a few years ago.  It is a great set, and is definitely a, \\"Must have.\\")
0192834290|5.0|One of the first Victorian sensation novels where Collins inspires a creepy effect for his unexpecting readers. Unsolved mysteries at the end of every chapter often shock and trouble you immensely. Prepare to be stunned  by Collins' slight comedy in the character of 'Mr Frederick Fairlie' and  the unfailing strength of Laura and Marian. Full of mystery and suspense  that induces a rollercoaster drop effect in your stomach at success, or  makes you cold as never ending obstacles are layed in the struggle for  happiness. A must for any reader!
B00000J7J4|2.0|This album is a mixed bag. Four tunes (Yaleo, Love of My Life, African Bamba and Smooth) are exceptional and worth the price of the album. However, I found the other tracks to be very uninspired and lacking in the  powerful but tightly controlled energy which generally hallmarks Santana's  music and performances. They are not bad from a technical perspective, but  they don't really groove.
0684833395|5.0|This is an excellent book chronicling the experiences of an American bombardier in WWII with objections to sacrificing his seemingly infinitesimal self in order to win a war.  The prose is stirring and  although the vocabulary can be difficult at times, it forces your mind to  create a vivid picture of the scenes.  The hilarious characters make you  laugh out loud.  My favorite scenes were with the two CID men with Major  Major and the scene where Yossarion pretends to be a man who died in the  hospital for the family of the victim.  It was seemingly almost entirely a  comedic piece until the last thirty pages, in which the reader arrives at  the startling revelation that nearly all of the enormous cast of characters  has died.  Though it took me a long time to finish, I would gladly read it  again.
B000031WD8|1.0|The plot?  Let's get laid  (while using Durex condoms and drinking Mountain Dew.)  THAT'S IT.  Hollywood says they arent responsible for the  moral decline in society...yet they frequently put out films like this with  underage drinking and sex.  Im only in my early 20's, so its not that I'm  an old you-know-what, but I really think this film puts alot of bad ideas  and values into kids' heads.  As far as the movie itself goes, the dialogue  is entirely cliche and stupid.  I know that all high school kids are not  like the ones portrayed here, but Hollywood wants to make you think so.  I  would give this negative stars if I could.
B00004T9VY|5.0|With this album, Cat Stevens was heard all over the United States. The song that did it was &quot;Wild World&quot; but others, such as &quot;Father And Son&quot; and the title track are also very fine. Stevens  has a fine voice and the songs he writes dig deep into your soul. This  album highlights all of that.
B00004TH83|5.0|This is a fabulous album.  All I can say is, Celine, I wouldn't stay away too long if I were you.  If you love Celine Dion, you'll love Lara Fabian.  She has a beautiful, strong voice, and sings with such strength &amp;  feeling.  Buy it, you can't go wrong!
B000031XCR|4.0|First, Iwant to tell that iam not expert in Celine Dion s music. My contact with the singer is not old. That is why I am going to express my humility opinion about this famous singer. I want to begin saying something  about her talent. I feel she is very talented and has a good voice. I am  sure she have worked a lot in order to improve her skills until having that  bautiful and atractive voice. In addition, the orchestra is great and  sounds very good. She has included interesting instruments, in an  extraordinary mixt between acustic and electric ones. The CD is tecnically  excelent: the melody is good worked and the rithm varied.  About the mesage  or topics she sings, I want to say Iam very happy because she transmits  good ideas about important things in the human life.
B00000064G|5.0|Surprisingly, it wasn't the VW advert that got me into Nick Frake, in fact, I don't think I've ever seen that advert. However, i did discover his music from around about the same time as the advert was being aired. I was  recomended to listen to Drake when scouring the internet for information on  Syd Barrett, and saw Drake's name pop up somehwere. Anyway, i downloaded  'Pink Moon' from Napster... and a few days later, i went out to buy Five  Leaves left, which I found highly enjoyable, and got better with each  listen.<br />Well, recently, I bought Pink Moon (the newly remastered edition)  and the music totally encaptivated me from the very first listen. The stark  harrowing simplisity of just Drake's vocals and acoustic guitar totally  moved me, so much. I knew before i bought the Cd that it was only 29  minutes or so... and i thought this would deter me somewhat, but it has  taught me that music does not have to be long to be good. I cannot say that  there is even a slightly bad song on this album, as every cut is so  captivating.. and you can really sence the lonelyness of Drake's state of  mind when this was being recorded. Highly recomended!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|WOW. I'll admit i almost didn't get this cd, and I would have missed out on some get songs if i didn't. This cd goes from falling into love (i knew I loved you), to trying to convince someone to take a chance on love (crash  and burn), to having problems in the marriage (two beds and a coffee  machine) in about a hour. There is not a bad song on this cd. It's got the  'gotta get up and dance' songs and the slow love ballads of &quot;I knew I  loved you&quot; to a broken up couple tryin to be friends again (I don't  know you anymore). Not to mention &quot;Gunning Down Romance&quot; which I  can't describe in words without making no sense cause of the emotions they  put into the song. Great cd, not at all a waste of money buying it.

READ it!  again and again and again. It's a keeper this one.  Yup! Ms Howard's books of late have been less than....well...up to  par...for a lack of a better word, but she redeems herself with Mr Perfect.  My only wish was the book could've been longer...with the characters  fleshed out more...specially Sam! So what are ya waiting for?  Witty  dialogue (though some might take offense...like as if we don't hear it in  everyday conversations!) great storyline, engaging protagonists and Linda  Howard. Don't hafta say more.
B00000JPYQ|4.0|If you're looking to get into UFO, a fine 70's British hard rock act, then this is a great place to start. All the essentials are here, especially my favorites &quot;Rock Bottom&quot; and &quot;Too Hot To Handle.&quot; This  is another one of those records along with Kiss' Alive, BOC's On Your Feet  Or On Your Knees and Rush' All The Worlds A Stage, and Nugent's Double Live  Gonzo that will stand the test of time of what a great 70's concert  experience was.

B00000AFWW|4.0|If all pop music was of the same quality as the pop music on Celebrity Skin, then people wouldn't have all freaked out when they discovered Hole had made a pop record. <br />Not that floral imagery, tales of summer crushes  and killer hooks are all that Celebrity Skin has going for it.  The music  is still plenty heavy.  Courtney still screams a lot, but now she takes  singing breaks in between.  Her lyrics are as brilliant as ever, sweet(?)  in some places, and down right vicious in others.<br />If your only exposure  to Hole has been the songs on the radio then the answer to your questions  are 1. Yes the whole record is that good and 2. No you won't regret  spending your hard earned money on Celebrity Skin.

0064407667|5.0|Okay, I thought that a book about bad things that happen to a few young children couldn't possibly be good. It couldn't possibly be interesting. And it DEFINITELY wouldn't be enjoyable.<br />Boy am I an idiot.<br />The  Baudelaire children are a trio of orphans who lose their parents early in  the book, and end up being shifted to the miserly accomodations of their  Uncle Olaf, a thoroughly despicable character who comes after Saruman and  the White Witch for hateability. He wants their money, which they are not  allowed to have yet, and treats them horribly.<br />The characters, except the  Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, have very little character  development but somehow end up being fully believable and playing on your  emotions precisely how the writer intended. The writing style is nothing to  write home about, yet manages to be witty and descriptive--I could  practically see the events being talked about, and the characters as  well.<br />In a word, this book has the quality of being a wondrous story  without overdoing the detail and things like that.<br />Does it have a happy  ending? You can find the answer at the very first page. This is a dark  story, dark but excellent. If your children want a happily-ever-after  story, I would advise not having them read this--it will only depress them.  But if your children are not disturbed by a more realistic story, then they  will love this.
B000006045|5.0|without the above two tracks will be four stars,i think Liz is more compatible than Tracy for massive atttack,&amp; fortunately Mezzanine is another big stripe after the masterpiece of &quot;blueline&quot;. this is  an album not to be missed not only for trip-hop fans but everyone
B000002JS6|5.0|Quaint by today's death/satan/devil/suicide rap music, this little gem popped up on my radar screen when I was a pizza-faced sophmore in high school. The music spoke to me immediately. I was suffering from all the  typical teen angst then..i.e., hated my parents, saw no hope for the  future, couldn't get action in a woman's prison with a fistfull of  pardons,etc. But these guys from Australia changed all that, at least for  45 minutes or so. Considering the alternative pop offerings of the  day...REO Speedwagon, Journey, Molly Hatchet, this album was like Hitler  showing up at a Bar Mitzvah....indescribable, but you had to see (or hear)  it for yourself. Every tune here kicks it hard, but none harder than  &quot;Shake A Leg&quot; with it's driving bass-line and scratchy guitar  grind, I pictured myself as a low class juvenile delinquent fighting on the  streets, even though I was living in a New England boarding school, wearing  a tweed blazer.
B000002J09|5.0|...and she's buying the stairway to heaven. With these timeless words, the quartet of Plant, Page, Jones, and Bonham cement their status as one of the greatest bands of all time. Led Zeppelin IV, a.k.a Zoso, is definitely the  best production of the group's career. Never before and never again did  they find the perfect mix of blues, rock and roll, and the unique Zeppelin  air that are all present here.  Black Dog is a great rock song, with an  unforgettable Jimmy Page guitar riff coming in between bursts of Robert  Plant's unique voice. Rock and Roll is a timeless tune by the band,  reflecting on the demise of the great rock and roll music. Battle of  Evermore is a unique song, a ballad actually, about the seemingly  neverending Celtic Wars. Stairway to Heaven...need I say more? Misty  Mountain Hop, Four Sticks, and Goin to California are all great songs, but  can't compare with Stairway and Black Dog. When the Levee Breaks shows the  band's blues roots in a very cool song that doesn't get much recognition as  one of the best Zep songs, but I think it deserves to be up there. This is  the best record from one of the best, and definitely most original bands of  all time. Zeppelin never sold out, and always did something different.  That's something that can be said of far too few bands today. Buy this cd.  Your view of great music will be changed forever.
B00004T8RK|5.0|When i first heard this album, i was ready to put it away never to be listened to again. Then, I listened to it again. Then, I listened to the album the whole way through while lying on my bed staring blankly at my  ceiling. When it finished, i got up from my lazy stupor and thought,  &quot;I like this now&quot;. So in conclusion to my long drawn out story,  this album grows on you. Basically, don't compare it to other Pearl Jam  records, because you will fail horribly.
B000000WCV|5.0|4 years ago, I was walking around the campus of Ohio State University and I went into a record shop.  In the little headphones on the wall, this album was playing.  I liked it and so I bought it.  I play it at a few  parties and everybody starts to like it--people are playing it at parties  from their own copy.  Now, 4 years later, I've listened to a lot of  hardcore dance music and Daft Punk is still way up on top.  Reviews  describe it as low-tech but good.  I describe it as a record that had more  thought put into it than 99% of others I've heard.  It's intense.  I  recommend it all the time.  Listen close, you'll probably hear it mixed in  to the music at the techno clubs where you live.  &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; is  the worst song I've ever heard though.  -Kyle6036@aol.com
B0000035E7|5.0|this is nirvana's most raw and hard album. its alot better than nevermind. which was a little to harmonized and to mainsreamed. and if your more of a fan of inutero than nevermind you should like bleach. anyways this album is  by NIRVANA you know its going to be good.
0517548232|5.0|This is a great primer that should be read in all schools.  Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here.  Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how  to think logically about economic issues.  And, of course, how you think is  the basis for what you think.  Even the casual reader will take away an  ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad  premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect.  Economics in  One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a  lifetime.
0790733900|5.0|This movie ranks as one of my TOP FIVE of all time. Classic Paul Newman! Of course! &quot;No one can eat 50 eggs!&quot; and &quot;What we have here is a failure to communicate!&quot; Some of the best lines in this flick  ever.  George Kennedy, what a role he plays. Keep your eyes peeled for  several familiar characters, who later became stars, such as: Ralph Waite  (Papa Walton) and Joe Don Baker (Walking Tall).  I can't say enough about  this movie, I could easily talk about it forever. The ensemble cast, the  storyline, the prison, the road gang, the heat, that song about the plastic  Jesus.........If you like Paul Newman, and you have not seen this  film....BUY IT NOW!
B000000W5B|3.0|Regardless of what anyone says about this album, it has &quot;Winter&quot;, one of the best thing the band ever did. &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Star Star&quot; are great too, but the  rest is filler, albeit filler performed only as the Rolling Stones can.
630575067X|2.0|The Phantom Menace is an OK movie. The special effects were good and the overall story was ok, but where did that GREAT suspenseful story go that was in the original trilogy? In my opinion there were too many special  effects that took away from the story. There were more annoying creatures  in this movie than in the original trilogy. The drama and the romance that  was in The Empire Strikes Back especially is not at all there in episode 1.  There was too much focus on the special effects in episode 1 rather than  the story.
B00000DGE0|5.0|An awesome album; I can listen to it for hours on end.  NEVER THERE rocks the house, and the remaining tracks are awesome as well.  It's like moss - it becomes beautiful and grows on you if you will let it.
0897500482|5.0|When I first ordered TOJKD and the &quot;Bruce Lee's Fighting Method&quot; books , I did'nt know that Bruce was not only a super-gifted martial-artist , but also perhaps the greatest innovator of modern martial-arts since Sun  Tzu or Myamoto Musashi !<br />I soon learned it , as any knew reader would  too. &quot;Tao of Jeet Kune Do&quot; made me feel like i've been struke by  lightning in first read! So many enlightments , and such indepth look on  EVERYTHING that makes a martial-artist an efficiant fighter!<br />Bruce lee  was a kinethetic genius , a very intelligent person , a gifted  martial-artist , and an avangard-thinker - You will never think the same  about martial arts practicallity again , and the change is for the better ,  believe me.<br />A mixture of philosophy and down-to-earth tips , remarks  concerning being better than you are now , and more than that , makes this  one of the greatest martial-arts books ever written.<br />A MUST FOR THE  ANALLITIC/SCIENTIFIC MARTIAL-ARTIST.
6300214354|5.0|&quot;Top Secret!&quot; is a hilarious spoof of the WWII adventure movies, except that it takes place in the 80s.  It takes a few viewings just to catch every sight gag.  WARNING: Do not eat or drink anything while  watching this movie.  You will either choke on it or spit it out on the  floor or TV.  This movie is that funny.  <br />The Zucker/Abrahams/Zucker trio  had yet another hilarious film under their belts with &quot;Top  Secret!&quot;  Where else can you see Omar Sharif get sprayed with ink from  a gag flower, charred with an exploding cigar, and get splattered with  whipped cream?
B00003CXA6|5.0|Although based on the novel The Killer Angels by Michael Shaara, the story follows the facts of the Battle almost to the letter.  This movie inspired  me to visit the Gettysburg National Hitoric Site.  I have been back twice  and will go back again and it is amazing to witness the actual sites and  recognize them from the movie.  This movie shows how close the Union came  to losing the war as well as why certain mistakes led to the war continuing  for 2 more gruelling years.  Do not be swayed by the length of this movie  at approx. 4 hours as there is enough intrigue and action to keep you  riveted to the screen to the last.  The only reason I can tell that this  was considered a novel instead of an actual historic record is the dialogue  and the fact that it tries to delve into what General Lee and the other  characters were actually thinking during the 3 day battle.
B000002HD5|5.0|The pride of Ohio's River Mecca, the Whigs let it all hang out on this stellar SubPop (Nirvana, Mark Lanegan, Sprinkler) release. The unbelievable  bravado of frontman Greg Dulli is matched only by the funkiest bandmates  since Morris Day's The Time. Touchingly depraved running the gammut from  drug abuse to sexual orneryness, this album has it all. An AP top 100  Alternative Album, this record is a must own for any serious devotee of  indie style rock. One listen to the painful and truthful strains of  &quot;Be Sweet&quot; or the addiction anthem &quot;Fountain and  Fairfax&quot; and anyone who has been out all night in the last decade will  be sold. The Whigs clearly studied the Rolling Stones, Curtis Mayfield,  Prince, Husker Du and Gang of Four because never has their been a rag tag  bunch of loveable hooligans to find the funk, blues, alt-rock and timing of  this band. And they love fellow Cincinnati bad-boy Pete Rose, the only  person in Ohio who could probably outlast 'em at the bar of your local  strip club. An amazing record. Check out some of their other stellar  releases, including &quot;Congregation&quot;, &quot;Up In It&quot;,  &quot;1965&quot; and the rocking &quot;Black Love.&quot;
B00000IOSU|4.0|I am a new listener to Sarah McLachlan. So, this compilation, a reflection of some of her best songs, works for me. I enjoy the strong , emotional vocals as well as her passionate timbre. And she has a great group of  musicians enhanching her voice.<br />These tracks are an eclectic collection  of well arranged, well mixed, music. &quot;I Will Remember You&quot;, is a  live version here &amp; puts me right in her concert audience. &quot;Ice  Cream&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; were a pleasant surprise for me.<br />A good  CD--especially for new fans of Ms. McLachlan.<br />Thanks for your interest  &amp; comments--CDS
B000002UJQ|5.0|Listen folks, it is simple. Radiohead do not care if you like them, in fact they would prefer it if you didn't. But despite their deserved pomposity, you should definitely like this band and particularly this album. From beginning to end, Radiohead sets the bar as high as nearly any alternative band has ever set it. \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"Exit Music For A Film\\" go from nervous quiet to gut-wrenching emotional in about 10 seconds. From Sesame Street chirping to chaotic textured guitar effects this album runs the gamut yet maintains a continuity not seen since Pink Floyd. There is a reason why every critic on the planet chose this as album of the year. And if you like this one, you will love their second long player \\"The Bends\\". I cannot say enough about the great heights to which this band has already soared and I await with great anticpation their next release ... . A must own worthy of as many stars as your scale allows.
B0000071J0|5.0|This is a very important prog rock album. Sounds a lot like ELP. A remake in English exists, with lyrics by Peter Hammill (I haven't heard it). Still, the Italian version should be the best one.
B000023VR6|5.0|Well I must admit that when I knew Dr Dre had a new album, I didn't expected it to be like this, because when the last album was good, you don't expect the next album to be as good or even better. But listening tot  his album was great, I really enjoyed it. I think that this album really  proves that we really shouldn't forget about Dre. There are a lot of good  songs, and what I like too is that there are so many songs on the album. I  think that with this album Dre really proved that he's still very very very  good!
B000031XCR|4.0|I found this CD to be an excellent one, 'cause it contains marvelous songs of the past decades, that expressed in Celine's voice, certainly takes you back to the essense of life and love.  <br />Certainly, we will miss her, and  will anxiously wait for her return.<br />Adrián Dixon
6300181278|3.0|This the first of Universal's horror cycle was haunting mesmeric gothic chiller in its time. Now it's stale and dated no thanks to the pedestrian direction of silent filmaker Tod Browning. The first twenty minutes are  superb set deep in the Transylvania with its excellent cobwebbed castle and  creepy characters, but the second part set mainly in the drawing room of Dr  Sewards sanitarium are yawn inducing. But try to put this aside and enjoy  the inimitable Bela Lugosi in his greatest role by far. His voice, gesture  and stature make him a perfect Count, and no one else since has has exerted  such a mesmeric power over the audience. Even when seen today and the  opening lines spoken by Bela &quot; I am Dracula &quot; have you rapt and  you believe him. Lugosi was simply born for the role. Unfortunate the film  wasn't better. Dwight Frye is delightful as the deranged Renfield. But the  other members of the cast are somewhat annoying, most notably the iritating  David Manners who played many a romantic lead in numerous Universal horror  films of the era. Helen Chandler as Mina isn't much better. But after all  this was a landmark film and will never be forgotten thanks to Lugosi.
B00003CWRX|5.0|The team from &quot;Heat&quot; (1995) strike back with an extraordinary piece that tackles on the issues of tobacco and the power of media. Important decisions are made, sometimes not too ethically, putting the  whole issue of media objectivity and transparency in the spotlight.<br /> As  for Mann, his shots, sometimes stressing due to their closeness and speed,  sometimes soothing due to their slow motion, deliver the message loud and  clear.<br /> Pacino's acting brings no new surprises: he's awesome once  again! You'll recall in particular, when you see it, the scene where he  delivers his lines to 60 Minutes's anchor, Mike Wallace, Don Hewitt (CBS  Senior Exec. Producer) and CBS News president. He'll move you with his  force and the passion he puts to accomplish his mission in the movie (which  I don't want to spoil).<br /> Simply put: one of 1999's best movies.
0800196767|5.0|This movie is a wonderful look at the brilliant child of a used car dealer.  Every minute of the movie was full of charm. If you have children or are a child a heart, get a copy.
B00002E233|5.0|Much more movies about animals terrorizing people are being developed. Much like Lake Placid sharks get smarter and start wrecking a floating lab shutting down controls and such. The cast is pretty good. You think LL Cool  J wouldn't be a good adsdition to the cast but surprisingly he is a very  funny and smart chef who loves his bird. This movie has a little humor and  nonstop action which isn't much worse than Jaws. It is more of PG-13 movie  than R but the swearing supposidly makes it R.
0064407667|5.0|I work in the children's section of a bookstore, and I've been eyeballing the Unfortunate Events series for a while now.  As someone who is completely sick of the Harry Potter phenomenon, I found the Snicket books  quite appealing.  (Actually, I couldn't finish the first Harry Potter book,  but I'll give it another try.  I promise.)  <br />The events in the book are  interestingly hard to place in time. The setting is uncertain; there are  horse-drawn carriages as well as automobiles in the streets, but Violet,  the eldest of the orphans, wishes for an inventing lab with computers.  The  last scene of the book takes place in a theater that reminds a reader of  something from Agatha Christie.  The drawings look like something from the  1910s.<br />The elusive quality of the author is also interesting, in contrast  to the high-profile of J.K. Rowling.  There's uncertainity that a Lemony  Snicket even exists.  I loved the little hints the author left about  himself throughout the book, and the references to a deceased woman named  &quot;Beatrice.&quot;<br />I also liked the fact that the children in the book  are like real children; they aren't overly cutesy, nor are they shown to be  stupid.  They are inventive, but not infallible.  At the same time, the  book isn't about real life.  It's still a fantasy, and I enjoyed that.   This is definitely a book worth reading, for adults and children alike.
6302373921|5.0|I've been a fan of Depeche Mode since I bought &quot;music for the masses&quot; in my college days. I had never seen the group live until their last tour for the &quot;Singles&quot; album and in preparation for  that, I rented this video, only to be blown away by the performance. I  turned my TV up really loud during &quot;Nothing&quot; and had to get up  and dance to &quot;Everything Counts&quot;, the big finale. I've become a  much bigger DM fan because of this film, which shows the guys during the  time when stardom was theirs and superstardom was just an album away.
6305807086|5.0|This movie is very funny, and as importantly, very original. Spike Jonze's directorial humor is perfectly aligned with the script, and he pulls off even the most challenging scenes successfully.<br />Likewise, the actors are  also up to the task of being believable or sympathetic in the midst of all  the absurdity. As almost everyone knows, this movie is about a character  finding a portal into John Malkovich's brain, and it takes a lot of skill  on the part of everyone involved in the film to make the movie as good as  its premise.<br />John Cusack is great as the down-on-his-luck puppeteer who  goes to work for a bureaucratic company whose most distinguishing  characteristic is its location on the half-height  &quot;seventh-and-a-half&quot; floor, where everyone has to stoop  over.<br />Catherine Keener is also excellent as Cusack's foil, a hard-nosed  opportunist who tempts Cusack away from his wife (an unrecognizable Cameron  Diaz) and stops at nothing to realize her own fantasies.<br />The film is  filled with metaphor, but is rarely heavy-handed. The chief metaphor  involves Cusack's roll as a puppeteer, whether with marionettes, or the  body of Malkovich. It turns out that almost every character wants to  manipulate another character to achieve his or her own goals.<br />Director  Jonze does a nice job of intertwining the visually fantastic (the portal to  Malkovich, the 7 1/2 floor, etc) with the utterly real (the New Jersey  Turnpike, Cusack's street corner puppet box), so you never get too far  removed from the reality of the characters' relationships with each other.  In other words, Jonze creates a fantastic world but keeps you connected to  the people who live in it.<br />Jonze's best moments come near the end of the  film, which I'll try not to spoil -- one involves a flash back sequence of  an animal, and the other involves two characters travelling through a third  character's memories. As far as I know, nothing like it has ever been done  on film before, and both are done with a sense of humor that belies their  genius.<br />This movie is one of three or four in 1999 that I think will be  remembered for changing the direction of film away from all the &quot;Pulp  Fiction&quot; knock-offs that dominated the late nineties. The success of  movies like this, hopefully, will encourage film makers to have a bit more  confidence in their audiences.<br />The disc has several extras, though it  lacks a commentary track (which would have been the icing on the cake). Two  of the extras are extended segments of programs that appeared on television  within the film. (In other words, a TV in the movie was showing something.  These extras are full-sized, full length versions of what the TV was  showing...A similar thing is done on the Criterion Silence of the Lambs  DVD). Another extra is a 20-minute or so exploration of the puppeteer  &quot;pulling the strings&quot; behind the scenes of the film. It serves as  a good introduction to a field of entertainment you probably haven't given  a lot of thought to lately.<br />Another extra is a brief, parodic interview  with the director while he's driving his car. It's a good for a laugh or  two, though he (purposely) doesn't offer much insight into the film. One  other extra feature is footage of an extra who had to drive her car in the  background of a shot on the NJ Turnpike, along with a couple of dozen other  extras. It's shot with a shaky camcorder by, and is entertaining because  the girl is really funny, although, again, it doesn't really tell you much  about how this movie (or any other movie) is made.<br />Finally, there is a  brief segment of a guy with a camcorder (the same guy who did the other two  extras) interviewing &quot;aspiring puppeteers&quot; about the movie at  it's premiere in LA. Very brief, and will make you laugh once.<br />The sound  and video quality are fine. The movie does not have a particularly  demanding soundtrack.<br />All in all, this is a greatmovie, one which will  probably be considered somewhat significant a few years from now, and the  extras on the DVD are good, though not great.
B000000FG8|5.0|I had this CD years ago when I was a kid but got rid of it a few years ago. Just recently all my CDs were stolen and I had to start from scratch. One of the first CDs I picked up was Operation Ivy and I forgot just how  good this CD is. It is meaningful, fast, powerfull and generally amazing.
068815333X|5.0|PRAYERS FOR RAIN             Dennis LeHane             Harper Torch - May 2000             ISBN:  0380730367              Buy a Copy <br />            Karen Nichols is a very pretty young lady who has a problem with a stalker,  so she turns to Boston P.I. Patrick    Kenzie to solve her problem. Kenzie  and his sociopathic sidekick and guardian angel, Bubba Ragowski, solve  Karen's problem    very quickly and he figures that he has heard the end of  Karen Nichols. But six months later he hears that she has jumped    naked  off the observation deck of Boston's Custom House and that she was drugged  up when she jumped. The fact that this    did not fit in with his  impression of Karen and that she had called him shortly before her death  and he never returned her call    made Kenzie feel compelled to look into  what went wrong in the last few months of her life. With the help of Bubba  and    Angie Gennaro, they uncover that Karen was into drugs, prostitution,  had some dreadful family secrets, and a madman that    knows how to  manipulate the minds and lives of his victims until suicide was a welcome  relief.  As the plot twists through    layers of old deceit and current  corruption, the victims multiply while the killer remains elusive,  protected by the terror he    inspires. <br />    Prayers For Rain is well  written with dialogue that is gritty and true to life. The scenes are so  vivid that the hair on the back    of your neck will stand straight on  end--a real page-turner from the beginning to the outstanding ending. This  book has graphic    violence and the darkest of dark humor. The villain in  this book is one of the slipperiest and most evil characters you will ever     read about. <br />      Pam Stone
B00000ILE7|3.0|This movie is OK. It isn't as good as the second film and definetly isn't as good as the first film. <br />PROS: Nice atmosphere and suspense, pretty scary, great ending<br />CONS: Bad script, bad alien effects, too profane,  some bland acting<br />BOTTOM LINE: It's OK. The third best in the series. A  few slightly redeeming qualities that keep it from being the worst in the  series.
0800128052|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Every aspect of this movie is just so good. I'll start with the cast. Seant Astin plays the incredible role of Rudy. One of the best roles for Sean Astin ever, and a very good  performance. Jon Faverau, Charles S Dutton, And Ned Beatty support, and are  the best for the role. David Anspaugh, great directing. The music by Jerry  Goldsmith is flawless, excellent score, I have yet to see one better than  this one. This is a true masterpiece. Great movie for everyone.Highly  Recommended!
B00001SIES|4.0|Muse are a three piece band with a passion for music! Go see them live on stage and you will see why!  I saw them and COLDPLAY at Wolverhampton civic hall in the UK on june 4th.  MUSE live is something to be seen all the album songs are re-kindled into there live incarnations!  Huge powerful  chords followed Sunburns intro on guitar!  it has to be heard to be  believed. The best part of this album is the lyrics. Call me mad but lyrics  mean music the key lyrics in Showbiz include: <br />&quot;royal canadian  blended the spicy aroma had mended me&quot; <br />from the track  &quot;Sober&quot; hey check out Muse's website   if you don't believe me!  and then we get  &quot;it burns inside of me&quot; as the highlight of the song!  Hmmmm a  unique style of lyrics i would say !  Check out the album and listen  carefully to the lyrics you'll fall for  them!
B000002U9Y|4.0|This album is an album of transition.  There are songs that are experimental, phycedelic, and progressive.  Floyd always was and always will be experimental.  But they were phycidelic with the great Syd Barrett.   This album has every kind of music they ever wrote. It is great but lacks  in the way that the band tries to sound like Syd and that hurts the album a  bit.  this is the first time (that i am aware of) that Roger writes about  war and the loss of his father in Corperal Glegg.  Great song..all rogers  contributions are wondeful.  Saucerful of Secrets is great..most are  amazing. Great album recomended to all who enjoy any era of the FLOYD
0060196122|5.0|I am crazy about this book. In fact...I am crazy about life. And thats what this book want to let you know...if you think you dont belong to this world, or if you arent sure about it, read this book. It will make you  love life. Ill say this is a great lesson to anybody that seeks advice to  give up stress, depresion, or sadness. Nothing worth stop your life. Keep  on living and sharing with those you dont even know. Something else: if  you have read other books from this author, this may be surprising,  specially the way he talks about sex. Great book!
B00003Q43A|3.0|I wasn't going to buy this film, but finally decided, what the hey, it's time for something gratuitously stupid, and the DVD package offered som einteresting extras (and had a very positive rating for its technical  qualities.)<br />Well, it's big, loud, and stupid, as ever, and no matter that  the special edition adds a few bits that help make some of the idiocy a  little less idiotic -- this is not saying anything to complement the film,  believe me.  The key to enjoying this film is in sitting back and letting  it roll over you -- Emmerich and Devlin mention THE TOWERING INFERNO as  their inspiration, and it's easy to see.  Remember, all those Irwin Allen  disaster flicks appeared to have been made by people with oysters in place  of brains.  The greatest regret for me is that the destruction of Los  Angeles isn't more prolonged (one of the key selling points of VOLCANO for  me.)
6305531412|5.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released (in Australia) for ages now, and I have been thinking about buying this DVD version, but I have decided to register a protest vote against Disney and the tactics they  appear to be using to make the world a sanitised artificial place by  censoring anything that does not agree with their world view.<br />It was  pointed out on a local TV show that Disney spent millions on their lifelike  CGI dinosaurs and yet they have no 'waste removal organs'. How lifelike is  that? <br />If enough people refuse to buy their products (especially the well  informed DVD buying market), then we may be able to force them to release  more complete versions of their old classics. Register a protest vote  today!
0380973464|5.0|This book grabbed my attention from almost the first page. Even though it's huge I read it in just under a week. The amazing story weaves through different times while still connecting within itself. I got a lot to think  about from reading this book and it's full impact has probably not set in  yet. Highly recommended, especially if you like his earlier work. (Snow  Crash, for example.)
B00001OH7P|5.0|Many reviews go on and on about the song lyrics /story line/ comparisons to other Bowie albums/ etc, etc... Here's the truth. This is one of the best Rock Albums ever made. Enough said.
0792140923|5.0|This movie was probably the 2nd one which seemed to establish Tom Hank's acting talents.  Hanks plays Forrest Gump, the simpleminded hero with a heart of gold. It seems like he's able to go anywhere just by running (and I mean anywhere and everywhere).  Robin Wright plays Jenny, Forrest's longtime sweetheart (who has a habit of coming in and out of Forrest's life) and Gary Sinese plays Lt. Dan, whose dreams to die on the battlefield are shattered as Forrest saves his life. The soundtrack covers a long period of time from Elvis Presley's &quot;Hound Dog&quot; to the Byrds' &quot;Turn, Turn, Turn&quot; to Bob Seger's &quot;Against the Wind&quot; along with Alan Silvestri's lovely background music (I'll comment further on the soundtrack in another review). The movie spoofs periods of time including Watergate (&quot;There seems to a problem with the lights at the White House; you may want to investigate&quot;), antiwar protests (&quot;In Vietnam,...&quot; then something &quot;goes wrong&quot; with the mike), and a reference to the &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; slogan.  Forrest also seems to become an inspiration to Elvis Presley and John Lennon.
B000002IP1|5.0|I have had this album since the day it was released. Over the years, I have read many reviews that either praise or down play this record by Phil. It is a classic album. It is filled with songs that connect with everyone's  lives. Most of the cd is ballads, but they are excellent and well written.  The lyrics are amazing. You have to realize that this is not a Genesis  album. It is all Phil. It is more of an adult type album, thus the title  &quot;..But Seriously&quot;. If you do not own it, I highly suggest it to  you.
6305897786|5.0|This is truly a &quot;thinking mans'&quot; horror movie.  Those who don't &quot;get it&quot; now never will and should probably stick to the more predictable genre films that don't require any thought on the viewers part.   The fact that so many viewers did not understand the ending has me  wondering if they paid attention during whole film or were they waiting for  some great CGI effects...or perhaps a good old fashioned run of the mill  American explosion.  Now for those of you who are sure you are  intellectually equipped to...heaven forbid think and figure out the ending  with the numerous clues Polanski presents, you are sure to have an  entertaining evening and perhaps even a intellectually stimulating  conversation with your friends.  This is great film intended for those who  walk away from the big budget hollywood movies feeling like they were  insulted.

B00004BZ0V|4.0|No need to repeat what everyone says, we already know it's just a singles compilation, not a 'Best Of'.  For the beginner who wants to get away from Limp Bizkit/metal-rap thug mentality, this is one of the good places to  start.  Here, they'll see that attitude and talent can mix, without the  fake bad-boy posturing getting far too common now.  If you start with this  CD and really like it, make sure to get the debut or 'London Calling' (or  both) since there are many other great tracks on those CDs.  Dive into  'Sandinista' at your own risk - sorry guys - there's only a short album's  worth of good material from that bloated mess.  'Combat Rock' is OK if you  find it at a cheap price.  To sum it up, this is a good CD to start with -  yes Virginia, it does have a reason for existing!  Otherwise, someone might  think it all started with Bizkit/Korn/Kid Rock/Papa Roach, etc.
B000001Y79|5.0|This is the best cd ever made in history-my opinion.  If you don't have this cd, you have to get it right now.  Trust me, if you liked &quot;Don't Speak&quot; and &quot;Just a Girl&quot;, you'll love the whole cd.  Make  the right choice, GO FOR IT!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Recently saw Metallica at Tattoo the Earth Tour in NJ. To say you need to see them live, is the understatement of the millenium. But listening to them live can be extremely good, too. I'm pushing 40. I like all kinds of  music. But this thing has been in the CD player for a good two months  running. For me, the highlight comes at the end as they finish  &quot;Battery,&quot; and James Hetfield hollers to the crowd: ARE YOU  ALIVE!  .....HOW DOES IT FEEL TO BE ALIVE!     After a few hours of  Metallica, the answer's in your pounding heart and the the hairs standing  up on the back of your neck.   I can't think of a band in the last 15 years  this outstanding. WOW!
B000031XCR|5.0|The first time I heard the lyrics of this song, I liked it.  I agree with them, if you love somebody, you want to give everything to this person without any restriction.   You must be able to give comprehension, support,  friendship, help, love, your feelings, etc.  If you don't be able to do  that, how do you love?  When you love somebody, do you put limits?  The  singer expresses these feelings so well.
B000002L9B|5.0|The album doesn't let on to the fact that the movie is a comedy which is cool.  Also, the tracks are banded together like \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and Prince's other masterpiece \\"Lovesexy.\\"  The beauty of this album will show you that the break-up of Prince And The Revolution was a really BIG DEAL in 1986!!
0395925037|5.0|Adolf Hitler was one of the most loved men of the 20th Century. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; we learn about the author's childhood, the collapse of Germany in 1918, the founding of his National Socialist German Worker's  Party and the abortive Beer Hall Putsch of 1923 which sent Adolf Hitler to  Landsberg Prison where he wrote his famous book. The author goes into  detail on policy questions which will later be realized just before and  during the Second World War. The book is said to be very prophetic in that  sense. Any rumors of the difficulty in reading the work or the poor writing  are false; it is easy to read and highly interesting. In short, this book  is a must for those wishing to gain a more thorough understanding of German  National Socialism and its creator.
B000005HLV|5.0|The greatest black metal album ever!It is creepy and violent from the opener funeral fog 'til the closing song that gives the name to the album. The singer, Attila did a great job, unleashing a macabre guttural voice  that I repute no. 1 in black metal. A must have for any true norwegian  black metal fan
0440234743|4.0|When I started this book, I couldn't put it down since it starts with a dying billionaire who writes a will where he leaves everything to Rachel, a daughter about whom his lawyers, the media and his family know nothing  about.  I couldn't wait to read the chapter where his selfish ex-wives and  children discover that they receive nothing, and they have many debts to  pay off due to their greed.  This leads Nathan, a lawyer and in rehab, to  go to South America in search of the heiress.  Will she accept the money or  not, and why? There is much adventure as Nathan and some friends he just  met go with him in search for this missionary.
0060920084|3.0|I first read Bill Bryson's &quot;A Walk in The Woods&quot;, detailing his experinces on the Appalachian Trail and was eager to read more of his works. While I found this book entertaining and humorous, I was mildly  disappointed. At times I found myself laughing out loud. Mr. Bryson has a  wonderful wit and sense of humor. But as the book wore on, I became  somewhat bored, much like the author himself. He was searching for the  perfect small town in America but all he found was an endless stream of  commercialism and neglect. Traveling through 38 states, he comments on a  few wonderful and enchanting sights but mostly complains about over  development and the lack of decent food. OK, we get it, but sorry Bill,  that's America. I don't care for the commercialization either but he  constantly beats a dead horse. He focuses on too many negatives and fails  to accentuate the positives. This is a wonderful country and the people and  scenery are all part of the unique tapestry that is America. He seems to  speed on through his journey and fails to stop and smell the roses. He  appears more interested in getting back to England than sharing meaningful  insights of small town America.

0800184327|3.0|I watch this the first time just last summer. Knowing that there would be latin music, dancing, etc... which I love. There was that. Go check out Albita, one who sings in the club! (I just saw her in concert, and she  rocks!) To go for the story, I really couldn't tell you what it was. There  was nothing profound about it, and the plot seemed elementary and boringly  basic. The only thing this movie accomplished for me, well then for  Chayanne also, was the purchase of his newest cd (which is kind of old  now), Atado a tu amor. wow he is hot and has a good cd!  He made the movie  worthwhile! I thought the movie was a bit tacky, but I know some love it. I  loved Chayanne's shyness in the dancing studio, even though I knew he could  dance and sing. The whole part with his father was not that great. This  movie wasn't a total bomb, but it just wasn't something that you could see  over and over again, (unless you just watch Chayanne)!:) enjoy!

B000002HRE|5.0|This cd is the twin of LOAD! Fuel and Ain't my Bitch are very much the same just like Low Man's Lyric and Mama Said (they have the same feel). I think the Unforgiven 2 is better then on The Black Album. Carpe Diem Baby,  Devil's Dance,and Fixxer are some of my fav songs. The only one that I  don't really care for is Better then You. Anyways, It's a great cd!
B00003CXDV|5.0|i think the movie should be a big hit<br />i like the movie a lot i rented a copy from a video<br />store a month a go it is funny

B00004TH6O|5.0|I picked up &quot;R&quot; because I'm a fan of Chris Goss and the Masters of Reality, and I just can't stop listening to it. Each track is unique and varied, but fits together as a whole. QOTSA remind me of other bands such  as Stone Temple Pilots and Screaming Trees, but are very different from  them as well. It's hard to describe the feel of the album, but it is  definitly worth repeated listening. One of the best rock albums to come out  this year.
6302862949|4.0|Ok, so White Nights is not THE greatest film of all time, but it is still a good movie about friendship, love, and the loss of one's freedom.This is worth seeing just to see two of the greatest dancers of modern times  together onscreen.

0441172717|5.0|As a child, I was first exposed to Dune- the movie. I liked the film, even if it was too strange and complex for me to fully grasp. But when I grew older, I found the book and I was truly amazed. Never before had I read a  book so fancifully detailed in its plot, descriptions, and characters;  Frank Herbert created an entire world, a masterpiece of imagination.  Muad-dib's struggle still holds me spellbound to this day, even after  hundreds of readings. This novel is a true work of art -- one of the  shining stars in the history of science fiction.
6305531374|1.0|Do you remmber the classic Halloween films? Well this movie made no sense to me because after Halloween 2 Michael's skin was burnt to a crisp and in Halloween 4-6 his skin stayed that way.If you have burnt skin can that go  away? Another thing that didn't ake any sense was did laurie ever menchion  that she had a daughter that was killed by Michael?

I mean I love the realistic perv. scenes just like the rest of the people... but surely you can't be talking about art in  &quot;Salo&quot;! Having said that, I am the proud owner of the VERY RARE  Criterion Collection DVD which is the full uncut version with improved  picture  and sound (I would give a 3/5 for the picture and sound in  DVD-terms but much better than any VHS cut I've seen).
B00001PE4D|5.0|A wicked, yet devishly delicious retelling of the classic French novel, &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses,&quot; &quot;Cruel Intentions,&quot; starts an all young cast, a modern setting, and revenge only as a bunch of  well-to-do kids can contrive. Sebastian Valmont (Philippe) wages a bet with  his stepsister Katherine (Gellar) that he can deflower the newest girl at  their prep school, Annette, (Witherspoon). If he loses, Katherine gets to  keep his car. If he wins, Valmont gets to have Gellar, the object of his  lust.<br />In his pursuit to win, Sebastian teams up with a very effeminate  friend (Joshua Jackson) who helps him blackmail a footbal player hiding in  the closet to find out who is badmouthing him to Annette. Mix in  Katherine's determination to get even with her ex-boyfriend by ruining the  reputation of his new, yet naive girlfriend Cecille (Zelma Blair) by  getting her involved with her African-American violin teacher, and you have  the recipe for revenge ala Upper East Side, Manhattan.<br />While the film's  dealings with such themes as lesbianism, homsexuality, drug use, and racial  dating make this a film for mature teenagers and/or young adults, the film  nonetheless was one of the best films of 1999 in my opinion. The DVD  version, which also contains the original theatrical trailer, associated  music videos, and deleted scenes are an added bonus. The ending where  Annette gets her revenge is a classic.<br />Keep an eye out for Swoozie Kurtz  as Sebastian's therapist, and  Tara Reed (&quot;American Pie&quot;) as her  daughter and the first victim of Sebastian's headgames. Christine Baranski  is simply wonderful as Cecille's overprotective mother, and both Philippe  and Witherspoon are so convincing as lovers, that their relationship  continued even after filming was complete (they're now married and have a  young daughter). <br />Whether you rent or buy this film, &quot;Cruel  Intentions,&quot; will provide you a with a wickedly enteratining dramathat stars some of today's up and coming actors.
B00004STUL|4.0|if one is looking for an action/comedy, cop-buddy movie, this is the one.  lawrence and smith are definitly very funny in this movie and you can tell they had a blast making it.  <br />this is micheal bay's movie directorial  debut and he directs it with flash and style... there is energy and  excitement in each of his shots.  the plot is cliche, the story  predictable, the characters are poorly defined.  even bay admits the script  wasn't the best.  but its the performances turned in by the main actors and  bay's visual style that makes what could have been a standard lethal weapon  rip off into one hell of a fun movie.<br />as a side note, mark mancina's  score for this movie is among the best I've heard in an action movie.  he  has fast paced pieces for the action scenes and slow, beautiful music for  the scenes involving emotions.  without his music, Bad Boys would have been  a little less enjoyable.
6305428050|5.0|In the tradition of the &quot;Goonies,&quot; Elisabeth Shue shines in her first starring role as Chris, whose day starts out on a bad note. After her boyfriend cancels their date, Chris decided to babysit for a couple who are  in dire need for her services. In care of charges, Brad and Sarah, Chris  believes this will be an ordinary job, however trouble comes knocking,  first when Brad's pest of a friend, Daryl comes to stay over, and then when  Chris' best friend is stranded at the bus depot in downtown Chicago.<br />What  follows are a series of madcap adventures that take these suburban kids  into the heart of the city. After their car's tire goes flat, the Chris and  the kids must find a way to find their way back home and go help her friend  at the same time. However, when they run into a car-theft ring  headquarters, their night won't be the same again.<br />Featuring a wonderful  cast including many actors unknown back then (Penelope Ann Miller as Chris'  friend; Vincent D'Onofrio as the mechanic, etc.), &quot;Adventures in  Babysitting,&quot; marks the directorial debut for director Chris Columbus  (&quot;Home Alone&quot;; &quot;Stepmom&quot;; the upcoming &quot;Harry  Potter&quot; film adaption) who does an excellent job of making this film  work. His ability to stretch character limits works well here, as he is  able to place the kids in nearly impossible scenarios. The most memorable  scene in this film that captures Columbus' imaginative directing features  Sarah scrawling the windows of the towering building in downtown Chicago  where her father works at night. As she scrawls the windows in fleeing from  a member of a car-theft ringleader, she sees her parents at their party  from the outside. Who could have thought of such a funny way of seeing your  parents at the wrong place and wrong time?<br />Similar to other amazing  average-day adventure films such as &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off,&quot;  and the &quot;Goonies,&quot; - &quot;Adventures in Babysitting,&quot; is  still as entertaining today as it was over a decade ago. Truly this is one  of the late 1980's hidden comedic gems.
B000000I0H|4.0|This was the only Oldfield album I never listened to much on vinyl as I always preferred the wonderful live version on 'Exposed', so seeing it available newly remastered it seemed like a good time to become  re-acquianted. I still it find less inspiring than the live version -  particularly parts three and four - with too many weedy sounding keyboards  and sparser instrumentation, especially during moments when the huge band  on the live version would generate an awesome crescendo of sound. Having  said that, it is still a very good, and often mesmerising, piece of music  and happily the sound quality of the HDCD remasters is excellent and a huge  improvement on previous CD's. <br /> This is more than can be said for the  shoddy packaging, though,  which applies for all the remasters I have  purchased. The covers are very poor quality - almost like colour  photo-copies giving the appearance of a pirate bootleg - and the booklets  are cheap and flimsy. The booklets come with specially written liner notes  which are excrutiatingly banal and full of errors. For example, the notes  repeatedly make reference to the inclusion of the track 'Guilty' which does  not even appear on the album, and never has. On the album 'QE2' the writer   claims that the title track takes up the whole of side one (it appears on  side two and at only seven minutes long could never have taken up the whole  side of any album). <br />If an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite  number of typewriters could write the works of Shakespear then I reckon it  would take half a dozen monkeys with a packet of crayons to write better  sleeve notes than this. Surprisingly, the guy responsible was brave enough  to put his name to this drivel.<br /> Elsewhere, the tracklisting for the  album 'Crises' completely omits one of the tracks and the small print for  'The Killing Fields' indicates that I am actually listening to 'Five Miles  Out'. These examples (I'm sure there are many more) are not just small,  petty errors, but whopping great errors than even a cursory proof reading  could have avoided.    The one redeeming feature is that if you collect all  the new remasters a tubular bells image will appear on the spines,  providing, of course, that you put them in the right order.<br />Kudos for the  those responsible for the remastering then, but shame on Virgin for the  awful packaging.
6304779356|5.0|As one of two teenage vampire movies released in 1987, (the other was the miserable &quot;Near Dark&quot;)&quot;The Lost Boys,&quot; is a hip, modern retelling of the vampire myth set in a Southern California setting.  Brothers Michael (Patric) and Sam (Haim) are the newcomers to the small  seaside town of Santa Clara, which is known as the murder capital of the  world due to the mysterious disappearances of many town residents.<br />At the  town's amusement park, Michael gets himself involved with a gang of  vampires, who appear as normal street punks. Meanwhile Sam, meets the Frog  Brothers, who run a comic book store at night, but are vampire hunters by  day. After Michael himself becomes a vampire due to drinking the blood of a  vampire, he is determined to find a way to save himself, the girl he loves,  and his family from the impending danger that lurks them.<br />Directed by  Joel Schumacher (&quot;Batman Forever,&quot; &quot;Batman &amp;  Robin,&quot; &quot;Flatliners,&quot; etc.), the film's appeal to teenagers  is due to its young cast, great soundtrack, and great, yet campy storyline.  Dianne Wiest is excellent as Michael and Sam's mother, and Kiefer  Sutherland in one of his first major roles is wicked as David, the leader  of the gang. <br />Keep an eye out for a pre-&quot;Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent  Adveture&quot; Alex Winter as Marco, one of the vampires. This film also  marked the first collaboration of the two Cories, Cory Haim &amp; Cory  Feldman, in a string of movies they made together in the 1980's  (&quot;License to Drive,&quot; &quot;Dream A Little Dream,&quot; etc.) that  capitalized on their teen-idol status. Reportedley, Jason Patric (who is  Jackie Gleason's grandson) hates it when fans mention this movie as one of  his best works, but the truth is it still remains one of the late 1980's  cult classics.<br />If you like a funny, yet scary movie in the same tradition  as &quot;Scram,&quot; then check out this movie. It gave me many memorieswatching it on DVD as it did when I first saw it at the theater.
6305892806|4.0|\\"Mansfield Park\\" is probably my least favorite of Austen's novels, especially with its plain, dull heroine, Fanny Price.  I also watched the video series of it, made years earlier than this version, and  found that series very faithful to the novel. I found it hard to get beyond  the plainly unattractive, placid heroine. So I didn't like it very much  either.  This newest version is a more modern adaptation with a markedly  different heroine, one who resembles Elizabeth Bennett of \\"Pride &  Prejudice\\".  I liked this version much more than the novel or the  earlier video series.  However, it still comes in behind the newest  versions of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" (Colin Firth) and \\"Sense  and Sensibility\\" (Emma Thompson).<br /><br />I enjoyed the slave trade wealth of  the family being brought into this film as well as (cousin) Tom's stunning  drawings of the abuse of slaves, which Fanny discovers while he is ill. For  the first time, I found Fanny's love interest attractive.  This is her  cousin Edmund, a future clergyman, played by Johnny Lee Miller, who is  already a film heartthrob.  The romance of the piece is a lot more  believable with such attractive leads at the heart of it.  The father of  the family, acted by playwright Harold Pinter, is a much darker character  than he is in earlier versions.  This is a plus to this version as well.  Austen purists may have problems with this film version but everyone else  should give it a try.  My husband, who is not a Jane Austen fan, liked this  film better than the other film or video versions of Austen's works so he  would probably give it a 5.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0385486804|5.0|This is a poignant, compelling narrative about Chris McCandless, an intelligent, intense, and idealistic young man, who cut off all ties to his upper middle class family. He then reinvented himself as Alexander Supertramp, a drifter living out of a backpack, eking out a marginal existence as he wandered throughout the United States. A modern day King of the Road, McCandless ended his journey in 1992 in Alaska, when he walked alone into the wilderness north of Denali. He never returned.<br /><br />Krakauer investigates this young man's short life in an attempt to explain why someone who has everything going for him would have chosen this lifestyle, only to end up dead in one of the most remote, rugged areas of the Alaskan wilderness. Whether one views McCandless as a fool or as a modern day Thoreau is a question ripe for discussion. It is clear, however, from Krakauer's writing that his investigation led him to feel a strong, spiritual kinship with McCandless. It is this kindred spirit approach to his understanding of this young man that makes Krakauer's writing so absorbing and moving.<br /><br />Krakauer retraced McCandless' journey, interviewing many of those with whom he came into contact. What metamorphosed is a haunting, riveting account of McCandless' travels and travails, and the impact he had on those with whom he came into contact. Krakauer followed McCandless' last steps into the Alaskan wilderness, so that he could see for himself how McCandless had lived, and how he had died. This book is his epitaph.

0060916540|4.0|An amazing tale of courage, fortitude, and a desire to live, despite dire circumstances. The author, Joe Simpson and his climbing partner, Simon Yates, ascend a perilous section of the Peruvian Andes. Near the summit,  tragedy strikes when Joe, up over 19,000 feet, falls and hits a slope at  the base of a cliff, breaking his right leg, rupturing his right knee, and  shattering his right heel. Beneath him is a seemingly endless fall to the  bottom. Simon reaches him but knows that the chances for Joe to get off the  mountain are virtually non-existent. Yet, they fashion a daring plan to to  do just that.<br /><br />  For the next few hours, through a snow storm, they  work in tandem, and manage a risky, yet effective way of trying to lower  Joe down the mountain. About three thousand feet down, Joe who is still  roped to Simon, drops off an edge, and finds himself now free hanging in  space six feet away from an ice wall, unable to reach it with his axe. The  edge is over hung about fifteen feet above him. The dark outline of a  crevasse lies about a hundred feet directly below him.<br /><br />Joe couldn't get  up, and Simon couldn't get down. In fact, Joe's weight began to pull Simon  off the mountain. So, Simon was finally forced to do the only thing he  could do under the circumstances. He cut the rope, believing that he was  consigning his friend to certain death. Therein lies the tale.<br /><br />What  happens next is sure to make one believe in miracles.

6305363668|1.0|The first time I saw this movie, it was in a theater. And what a movie! I saw it three times in a single day: The first time to &quot;hear&quot; the story Deckard was telling me. The second time, to &quot;hear&quot; the  dialogues. And the third one was to savor the imagery of it. I wanted to  see it once more that day but there was no other run then. Deckard  narrating the story was what made this movie unique: it was not a mere  science fiction, it was a story someone from a (probable ?) future was  telling me, citizen of the past (his past), warning me about loosing the  faith or trusting too much in Science. There should be a place for humanity  as shown by the last replicant while in his &quot;time to die&quot;. I felt  like I was inside Deckard's heart and soul while he was narrating his  story, trying to explain why he killed and why he did not feel good  killing, but doing it. And now, Ridley Scott just &quot;killed&quot; that  aura the voiced over version had. Scott killed the soul of this movie (if  you saw Babylon 5, which uses the same &quot;narrating&quot; approach, you  will understand why B5 is so special). No matter he goes deeper in his  version (who indeed wanted him to go deeper ? Not me, for sure), he missed  completely the point. I am trying to find the voiced over version. And if  you are considering buying this: see it first, see both versions, then buy  it if you like. I doubt you would not end up wanting to buy the voiced over  version. And if Harrison Ford made it really bad for he didn't want to have  the movie voiced over, well, he should watch carefully the scene where the  last replicant is &quot;loosing his moments like tears in the rain...&quot;  :^)
B00001NFCY|5.0|I had heard Creed before this cd came out but I never cought when the radio said that One and My Own Prison were by creed.  I then heard Higher and I thought that it was a great song but I wasn't sure if I'd like the  whole cd.  Eventually What if came out and I loved it.  I went out and  bought the cd the day I heard what if and I am so glad I did.  It is one of  my favorite cds, and creed easily became my favorite band after Red Hot  Chili Peppers.  All of the songs  are awsome and could be a hit on the  radio.  From the Opening track &quot;Are you Ready&quot;, it's almost  asking you if you're ready to hear a great cd,  To the last track  &quot;inside us all,&quot; which is an excellent end to this cd,you are  enjoying every minute.
B00000IMCW|5.0|This is a brilliant horror film.  If you like horror films and haven't seen this one, you're in for quite a treat.  By far the best and most fun of George Romero's &quot;Dead&quot; triology, this is also, in my opinion,  the best horror film ever made.<br />Four survivors of a world-wide  yawning-grave zombie plague hole up in an abandoned shopping mall and fend  off the mindless swarm of zombies that pose a threat to their continued  existence.<br />Romero does a terrific job of constructing an equally creepy  and adventurous atmosphere.  Being a child of the seventies, some of my  earliest memories are of wandering around large shopping malls in tow of my  mom.  Place has always been an important thing for me, and this movie is  definitely a movie with a spirit of &quot;place&quot;.  This movie touched  something deep in me the first time I saw it when I was about 14, and I've  loved it ever since.  There's plenty of wonder, adventure, fun, and humor  to balance the film's apocolyptic creepiness and bright-red comic book  gore.  I also love the love-of-film-making which makes itself so evident in  the film's camera angles, editing, choice of music, and montage shots.<br />It  would doubtlessly be terrifying to truly be one of the last few people left  on the face of the earth with warm blood flowing through your veins, but  there's something about imagining banding together with a couple of friends  and taking on a world of zombies that seems so...well, so fun.  &quot;Dawn  of the Dead&quot; makes it seem like it might just be the time of your  life.<br />An excellent film, maybe not perfect in all technical senses, but  clearly making up for any flaws with an abundance of style, mood, and  substance.<br />I just hope George Romero decides to release another version  of this DVD including a commentary track, as he did with the recent DVD  relases of his other great films &quot;Knightriders&quot; and  &quot;Martin&quot;.  Of course, I also hope his name will be returning to  the big screen sometime soon.urning to  the big screen sometime soon.
0312958455|4.0|The Last Coyote was my 7th Michael Connelly. I found The Last Coyote just as good as the rest of them. The only bad thing is that they portray Harry Bosch as a drunk, loser, cigarette-smoking slob in this one, which he  isn't. I loved the plot the whole way through and was, like always,  surprised with the ending. I really didn't see why the author named this  book &quot;The Last Coyote,&quot; I feel that were better names for the  title than that. Overall, another winner.
B000001IPP|3.0|Lets Go is Rancid's worst CD, but that doesn't mean its not worth buying.  There are a lot of forgettable songs on here that sound the same, but tracks like Nihilism, Radio, and Salvation make anyone who doesn't have  this album seem like a retard.
B000001E8S|5.0|I will refer to the last line of &quot;slug&quot; to define U2 ...don't want to stay the same ... It is no secret since 1991's Achtung Baby that U2 have been bending borders and breaking rules. on 1993's Zooropa U2 sat back  and relaxed and reinvented themselves in a way that most rock groups  cannot. Only the radio fans of U2 would see that U2 took a leave of absence  between 93 and 97. But thru alot of soundtracks and side-projects U2 stayed  active. one of those side-projects being Passengers : Original Soundtracks  1 a collaboration between U2 and Brian Eno. This is not a mainstream hit,  but I think it should be. This is very meaningful and moving music and it  deserves recognition. From the very start of this record you are thrown  into an unknown world of ultraviolet masterpiece. Songs like  &quot;slug&quot; and &quot;your blue room&quot; just have you begging for  more. but the songs like &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot; and &quot;Corpse&quot;  just leave you wide awake for anything next. What do you get ? you get a  humourous Bono chant in &quot;elvis ate america&quot;. the last 3 tracks  are very beautiful and shows you that Eno did most of the work and U2 were  just the Passengers taking a ride with him. I look forward to the new U2  album in October, and if you have heard any of the new U2 songs. Then you  should hear alittle bit or Passengers in them.

0140277447|5.0|In highly readable book which is not meant to malign an entire people or culture, but rather to record a little-known history, Iris Chang presents an account of the events that occurred in the city of Nanking, China,  during World War II.  Beginning with a brief history of Sino-Japanese  relations and some  insights into the Japanese culture, Chang proceeds to  tell about the Japanese invasion of China and atrocities perpetrated both  on Chinese soldiers and civilians by the Japanese forces occupying Nanking.   In conclusion, she relates how Japan to this day has not taken  responsibility for those atrocities nor has atoned for them.<br />THE RAPE OF  NANKING is a detailed and well researched chronicle of a situation of man's  inhumanity to man and  an important lesson in history.  It must made more  public despite Japan's attempt to cover up the facts of what truly  occurred. Some of the barbaric torture that the Chinese victims were forced  to endure at the hands of the Japanese and the speed at which it occurred  make the systematic murders of  Nazi Germany seem tame by comparison.   Chang tries to understand how any individual or group of people can become  so completely insensitive to life as to perform unthinkably barbarian  attacks and murders and then go on to live an otherwise normal life and  never be held accountable for past animal-like brutality.  She paints a  clear picture of what happened to the Chinese population of Nanking at that  point in history in an attempt to prevent such tragedies and waste of human  life from ever happening again.
B000023X9W|1.0|If you are looking for the same quality of music as Zuma, Tonights the Night, Freedom, Ragged Glory, Harvest, or Rust Never Sleeps, leave this one on the shelf. I have listened to this CD in excess of 10 times and there is  not one song or even one phrase of one of the songs that sticks in my mind.  It should be renamed &quot;Neil Does Muzak&quot;. None of the songs have  any bite, wit, scathing social commentary, or humor that is Neil's  trademark. Was this released due to contractural requirements or as I said  in the title of the review, &quot;Neil, did you lose a bet?&quot; or what  happened here. To sum up this release in one word - DISAPPOINTING.
630587493X|5.0|My 8 year old grandson loves this movie and I love not only the movie but the probing conversations we share after seeing the movie.  <br />Robin Williams performance is perfection and the pace of the movie is thoughtful.   It allows children as well as adults to truly query themselves on the  trial and tribulations with living for eternity and love of family and  spouse.  <br />Bicentennial Man demonstrates how you earn privleges by  learning/showing responsiblity.  The development from robot to decision  maker is much like the path a child to adult takes.  We found the robot  learning about himself uplifting and encouraging,  reminding us that we can  learn by our mistakes.<br />I strongly recommend this movie for the family.   It will give you precious moments for years to come.

B00004WG2X|4.0|This adaption of Jane Austin's novel was beautifully done.  The leading actors performed wonderfully, with a theatrical-type presentation.  Had I not first seen the film adaption of this movie starring Colin Firth, I  would have probably have given this film a 5 star. The later is done more  in a &quot;movie&quot; format as opposed to a &quot;theatrical&quot; one  and, as such, had more freedom to develop the characters.  All in all  though, this film is a memorable and enjoyable way to spend a weekend  evening!
B000000WGL|5.0|In a hundred years, maybe two, but certainly someday, people will finally acknowledge Keith as the most significant musician and musical ambassador of our time. The man who wrote &quot;Satisfaction&quot; stated when he made  &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot; that he was &quot;trying to grow this music  up.&quot; I'd like to thank him for recognizing the limitations of the  genre (it's his genre!) and being artist enough to do something about it.  Keith's not the only artist trying to &quot;grow up&quot; rock and roll (I  think Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello, to name two, succeed at this), but  not too many spring to mind. When &quot;Talk is Cheap&quot; was released,  Charlie Watts moaned &quot;Keith's gone and made the album we've been  trying to make for ten years.&quot; Charlie was no doubt right. &quot;Main  Offender&quot; is well worth your time too.

0790738139|5.0|I was in love with Titanic and agreed that it should have won every award it did....that is untill I saw L.A. Confidential. This movie blew my mind. The plot was fascinating, an inside look of the workings of the L.A.P.D in  the 50's. The directing, cinematography, all of the designings were  astounding. Its also one of those rare films that the script pretty much  stick to the novel. The acting was flawless, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe  (in a powerhouse performance) and Guy Pierce were all overlooked at Oscar  time. It truly is one of the best movies of the 90's, right up there with  American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List. If you havent  seen this movie yet, go out and rent it, and I doubt you'll be  dissapointed. However, I must warn you that the begining is a little slow,  but it soon picks up the pace....pay attention or else you might not get  the ending.
B000002W5J|5.0|While the Airplane's lustre has dimmed considerably since its psychedelic heyday, more than any of their albums &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; has remained fresh.  Not as overtly political as &quot;Volunteers&quot; or as  jaggedly innovative as &quot;After Bathing At Baxter's&quot;, this album  still can transport the listener to a particular place and time without  twinges of embarrassment at its naivete. The songwriting is perhaps the  Airplane at its most focussed and the performances are free of the mannered  affectations that would mar later outings.  Grace Slick is at her least  strident, Marty Balin is at his most tender and the rest of the band  service the needs of the songs instead of their own egos.  In fact, this is  Balin's last album as leader and chief songwriter.  From here on in, its a  ruthless democracy, but &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; is so rich  because  of his contributions.  &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Comin' Back To Me&quot;  are two of the finest (and most haunting) love songs produced by any rock  group in the 1960s.  At the same time, the  band's hardest-rocking numbers,  &quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot;, &quot;She Has Funny Cars&quot; and  &quot;3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds&quot;, are also his.  It was Grace Slick,  however, who hit radio paydirt with &quot;White Rabbit&quot; and  &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;, which contains the most ferocious guitar solo  to ever assault the Top 40.  Naturally, she became the visual focus for the  group and to Balin's chagrin.  Some filler slightly lessens the impact of  the album's second half, but the best songs, the aforementioned ones, plus  the instrumental &quot;Embryonic Journey&quot; are wonderful.  This album  also has a sleek, echoey Hollywood sheen due to commercial producer Rick  Jarrard that, contrary to the band's opinion, actually contributes to its  haunting, timeless quality.   This is a must-own, classic rock album.  Why  RCA has not remastered this album, as it has the rest of the Airplane  catalogue (even their awful final two albums) is beyond me.  If you've got  the money, find the RCA Gold Disc version which is considerably cleaner and  includes both the stereo and mono mixes of the album.
0800116917|5.0|No one was a more masterful film maker than was David Lean, the British director who brought us such unforgettable classics as \\"Bridge Over the River Kwai\\", \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" \\"\\"Ryan's Daughter\\", and of course, \\"Lawrence  of Arabia\\"(see my reviews of all these films). The cinematography is always  spectacular and breath-taking, and one has to agree with the comments of a  previous reviewer that here the desert plays a well-scripted supporting  role in the unfolding drama that was T. E. Lawrence's experience during the  First World War in Arabia. Lean always focused his films on the ways in  which individuals and their personal characteristics clash and meld with  the larger social, cultural, and historical surround in which they are  located, and so each film is a particularly captivating study of the  specific dynamics of each such situation. Each of these films is also a  well-choreographed and photographed excursion into the topography, climate,  and landscape of the geographic location in which the drama unfolds. The  eyes and ears are always delighted by what Lean displays.<br />Here young and  bookish Lawrence is faced with the unenviable and unlikely prospect of  trying to unite the multitude of Arab Bedouin tribes in support of the  Allies in the regional warfare associated with WWI. The film captures this  unlikely and somewhat quixotic personal odyssey most memorably, and a very  young Peter O'Toole is masterful in his edgy portrayal of the enigmatic  Lawrence as a time-trapped romantic caught by whimsy and circumstance in  the most mind-boggling adventure of a lifetime, an adventure that broke all  the rules of convention and upper-class British expectations.<br />He meets  his match with other characters played by Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, and  Sir Alec Guinness. And in capturing the comically mismatched skills,  expectations, and romanticism that Lawrence launched into the larger  picture of what was going on, by viewing his personal odyssey in the  context of the much larger cultural framework of Arab ambitions,  jealousies, and cultural differences, we are magically transported into the  strange and marvelous world of the desert and all the romance and mystery  of that region.  Viewing each of David Lean's splendid and classic films  is a treat and a privilege; no one was as prolific, as consistent, and as  engaging a storyteller as he. Lawrence of Arabia is one of his finest  films, and as such represents a wonderful standard of excellence in  storytelling and film experiences. Sit down and relax, for you are in a  master's hands.

B00003Q43A|5.0|ID4 DVD By: Heather Wadowski USC Grade: A+<br /> In 1996 one film stood out during the summer blockbusters-- \\"Independence Day, \\" or \\"ID4\\" as it has come to be known. It had everything to make it an instant hit and a  classic for people to enjoy years down the road: a touching story, engaging  characters, humor, lots of stars, even more explosions, and something most  big blockbusters forget to include... a plot.  Now, for its fouth  anniversary, \\"ID4\\" is being released on DVD. And, just like the movie  itself, it is coming out with a big bang.   \\"ID4\\" the DVD edition is  flawless and extremely entertaining. It shows that just when viewers  thought \\"ID4\\" couldn't get any bigger, it still has some explosions left to  please us all.  \\"ID4\\" the DVD is a 2 DVD set featuring: the original  \\"ID4,\\" \\"ID4\\" the special edition release with 9 minutes of added scenes,  commentary by Roland Emmerich and Dan Devlin, theatrical trailers, TV  spots, the original biplane ending, production stills<br />gallery, an \\"ID4\\"  game, special effects commentary by Academy Award winners Doug Smith and  Volker Engle, and more. All and all this adds up to hours and hours of  \\"ID4\\" fun.  Even though Independence day is over and done with,  celebrate our freedom with the cast that's thought of every Fourth of July;  The cast of \\"ID4.\\" For Sci-Fi fans and especially fans of Will Smith, Bill  Pullman, Vivica A. Fox, Randy Quaid and Jeff Goldblum, this is a must-have  DVD.
B000002KEV|5.0|&quot;A song called 'Highway Star'&quot; With those five simple words, Ian Gillan introduces what has become the best live performance ever captured.  This is my favourite live album.  It captures the peak of the British Heavy  Metal Era of the late 1960's and early 1970's in so many ways: Ian Paice  precision drum solos, Roger Glover as steady a bassman as any; Paice and  Glover earn special credit for mixing and producing this historical  document of sound; Jon Lord commanding the Leslie Organ whose powerful  sound not only anchors the band but also relishes in that unique keyboard  instrument which was lost to the synthesizers; Ian Gillan whose range and  forceful vocal delivery defined what a male rock singer should be.  Often  imitated in countless hairspray bands of the eighties.  Ritchie Blackmore  way out front with an arrogant swagger that extols the excesses and  adolescent brashness that is the driving force of Rock and Roll.  However,  unlike many others, Blackmore's act has substance as time has proven him to  be father of countless garage bands echoing the heavy three chord opener of  Smoke...; speed thrash heavy metal heads such as Yngwie Malmsteen credit  Blackmore as an influence, you can hear his flurry of single string and  chromatic solos punctuating the solos of metal in the eighties and early  nineties (cf Mettalica, Megadeath, ...).   The individual talent alone  would be enough however, even that is overshadowed by how Deep Purple  operates as a unit.  Blackmore and Gillan trade note for note, in a call  and respone at the end of Strange Kinda Woman that must be heard to be  believed.  Glover and Paice hold down the rhythm like a locamotive.  The  contest between Lord and Blackmore has the energy of great athletes  competing.  Think Byrd and Magic.  These guys imitate each other, provoke  each other, and blend together to create a defining moment.   If you are  interested in what British Rock and Roll was all about in the seventies,  this album will be interesting to you. &quot;God Bless you and Good  Night.&quot;
B00003CXFV|5.0|Erin Brockovich By: Heather Wadowski USC Grade: A+<br /> There is only one thing wrong with Julia Roberts' latest hit \\"Erin Brockovich\\" and that is that the film was released at the wrong time.  \\"Erin Brockovich\\" is  the perfect film to sweep the Academy Awards if only it was released around  the holidays. It is a touching movie that stays as real to real life as it  can. Similar to real life, the only way to get through the rough spots is  to laugh, and writer Susannah Grant knows this. Even during the film's most  depressing and down moments, humor rises to lighten the mood and entertain  the audience.   Julia Roberts gives her best performance to date as  Erin Brockovich, and she alone makes the movie. Albert Finney gives a  wonderful performance as well as Ed Masry, the boss who hates to love Erin.  His performances definitely deserve a nod come Oscar time, while Roberts  deserves not only a nod, but the gold.  Based on a true story, \\"Erin  Brockovich\\" is the story of a desperate single mom who takes a job in a law  firm to help put food on the table for her kids. What she ends up  discovering though are connections between a power company's abuse of toxic  chromium and the sick town locals who have been drinking the poisoned water  supply.  The DVD also includes deleted scenes, production notes,  spotlight on-location, theatrical trailers and \\"Erin Brockovich: A Look at  a Real Life Experience.\\"  If there is one film every movie fan should  see it is \\"Erin Brockovich.\\" Even with all the great summer films out in  the theaters right now, this one still beats them hands down. So go out and  rent the film that should sweep the Oscars before everyone else runs for a  copy, \\"Erin Brockovich.\\" It is a touching story, a great comedy, and a  tear-jerker... in other words it has something for everyone.

6305903182|5.0|The most terrifying scream is always the last one, or so \\"Scream 3\\"proclaims. Surprisingly enough though, the ending to Kevin Williamson's clever trilogy doesn't let viewers down-- even without Williamson scripting  the final chapter.  From the opening scene fans of \\"Scream\\" and \\"Scream  2\\" will be shocked and pleasantly surprised at who lives and who dies. And  although the ending is your typical cheesy horror film conclusion, it fits  \\"Scream\\" perfectly. After all, this wasn't just any old horror franchise.  This horror series cleverly made fun of its own genre and trilogies while  scripting together an engaging and intriguing plotline that kept viewers  guessing to, appropriately enough, the very last scream. Written by Ehren  Kruger, \\"Scream 3\\" is the perfect ending to the horror franchise that  brought back scary movies in the `90s. Clever, funny and suspenseful,  \\"Scream 3\\" leaves the rules that ex-Scream star Jamie Kennedy clued viewers  in on in the original \\"Scream\\" at the door.   Neve Campbell, David  Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette return for the final chapter of the  \\"Scream\\" series, but this film is Arquette and Cox-Arquette's alone. While  viewers should care about Campbell's character and whether or not she  lives, viewers will be cheering for the ruthless TV reporter Gail Weathers  and the dopey Deputy Dewey the whole time. Hopeless romantics will also get  caught up in whether or not the two on-again off-again, real-life duo will  end up happily ever after like they did in real life.   As though the  film wasn't great enough in the theater, the DVD just adds to the whole  \\"Scream\\" experience, giving away not only the alternate trilogy ending, but  also giving fans a chance to see deleted scenes and out-takes from all  three \\"Scream\\" films. Additional DVD features include the Creed \\"What If\\"  music video, theatrical trailers, and commentary by horror master Wes  Craven.  So sit back with a friend or loved one, turn off the lights,  and get readyto laugh and scream one final time. You won't be  disappointed.
0440219078|4.0|The Giver, a story focusing on a controlled world, with young Jonas being the major character, keeps the reader turning the pages.  However, I wonder how much more or less eager I would have been to keep those pages turning  had I not seen &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, &quot;The Matrix&quot;, or  &quot;Pleasantville.&quot;  If you are considering reading this book and  have seen those three movies, imagine a world that combines all of those  movies.  A world that to most is seen in black and white(Pleasantville), a  world where pills are taken to maintain the present state of  awareness(Matrix), and a world where all seem horribly unaware of an  entirely different world outside the one in which they live(Truman).   Having seen those movies made me aware in advance what otherwise might have  been great surprises in the story.  From minor hints and foreshadowing, I  could pretty much guess what was going to happen next..there were no real  surprises.  Of course, I am not saying that this book is a rip-off of the  big screen, the book predates each of the afore-mentioned shows. The story  ended in a manner which begs a sequel, leaving more questions than answers.   Some have criticized the book for some vivid descriptions concerning  infanticide, but I've read far more gruesome details in my daily newspaper.   Overall, my main thought the entire time reading the book was that I've  heard this story before..but that is in no way any fault of the author.

6303212379|5.0|so many years. I loved this movie as a child and I am still in love with it now. It has all the adventure a person could want as well as plenty of comical characters to lighten the mood. This movie will definitely reach  classical level in the coming years because the story of children hunting  for treasure is a timeless adventure that everyone can relate to. If you  are an adult and you watch this film it will sweetly remind you of those  times when you once believed that finding the lost treasure of a notorious  pirate was still within the realm of reality. It's a great movie all  around.
B00004U3UG|1.0|While I love Army of Darkness more than life itself, I was hugely let down by the Director's Cut DVD. Not only is it woefully short on extra features (no theatrical trailer, no cast / crew bios; to be fair, there is  director's commentary and a storyboard function that's sort of neat, but  not -that- neat), the shortcomings are many.<br />The &quot;extra  footage&quot; is negligible, split up into several 5-second blips that  you'll likely only catch if you've seen the movie ten times or more. Some  of the best lines (&quot;Good.... bad...I'm the guy with the gun&quot;)  have been stripped in favor of less-funny replacements (or just stripped),  and the new ending, though I've seen it previous to buying this edition, is  a good portion less entertaining than the theatrical ending.<br />This would  all be OK by itself, but there are some -terrible-quality issues with the  DVD - during any portion involving stop-motion, the picture quality simply  tanks -- there's huge purple lines at one edge of the screen, and the color  gets so dark and muddy that it's actually inferior to VHS. the color and  quality snaps back whenever there's -not- stop-motion, so it feels like  you're watching two different films, twenty years apart, haphazardly  spliced together. It's extremely distracting and impossible to get over.<br />Having rushed to buy the Director's Cut, I now find myself wishing I'd  just bought the &quot;vanilla&quot; theatrical edition instead... my money  would not have been wasted. I am sorry and disappointed to advise you not  to purchase the Director's Cut.
0670824399|5.0|With all the talk of the new Harry Potter series, I find it essential to bring attention back to Roald Dahl. I love the Harry Potter books and give them all 5 stars.  However, I also realize many themes from Harry Potter  have been covered by Dahl years before.  After reading Matlida as a young  child, I went out and tried to read any and all Dahl books.  They are  wonderful pieces of work and inspire.  In an age where Harry Potter is  becoming a classic, let's not forget the books which paved the way for  Rowling.  Matlida and Harry Potter are both great books, both classics.
B00003BDXG|5.0|it's a shame this DVD is not anamorphic - but just having it in widescreen after watching the VHS p&amp;s version with HEAPS of footage taken out is enough for me to thoroughly recommend this dvd - such a moody film, the  soundtrack is perfect - the leonard cohen song starting during the opening  'Regency' logo gives me chills every time!
B00003CWTH|3.0|Magnolia <br />Magnolia, P.T. Anderson's 2000 follow-up to his  very strong 1997 effort Boogie Nights (which launched  the by now very successful film career of one-time  disco rapper Markie-Mark Wahlberg) is a confident,   brazenly directed piece of Altmanian-Scorseseness that  keeps the tempo  pounding, the effects coming, the actors  Heroding, and the old melodrama  successfully dripping  for three or so odd hours. It is brave, fearless,  ambitious,  gonzo filmmaking that puts most of 1999<br />to shame, and seems  alongside a movie like DiCaprio's The Beach (new on video this week) a  dollar to a donut.  It is heartbreaking for me to say, therefore, that in  the  end Magnolia fails, badly, and though more worth  your while,  probably, than all but five other films you  can name made during the last  year, simply because it  points ahead at the coming artistic success of a   talented director (which Boogie Nights also did,  unfortunately), Magnolia  is an uneven, derivative,  and obviously written corn-husk doll dressed up   to look like Barbie. <br />There isn't a storyline as such. If you are  familiar with  Boogie Nights or the ensemble films of Robert Altman  (and  here I'm talking Nashville or, even more so, Short-  Cuts) then you know  the idea: here are a bunch of  seemingly un-related characters--a game show  host (Baker  Hall), his wife (Melinda Dillon) a dying old man (Robards),   his unhinged wife (Moore), his empathetic nurse (Hoffman),  an infomercial  uber-stud (Cruise), a wacked out drug  addict (Walters), a dim but  good-hearted cop (Reilly) who  is in love with the wacked out drug addict,  who is also the  game show host`s daughter, a child genius (Jeremy   Blackman) with family issues, and an ex-child genius  (Macy) in love with a  brawny bartender--and part of  the fun, ostensibly, is figuring out how  they all connect  in the end. And connect, of course, they do, but to   reveal these connections in this review is to disservice  the film of one  of its most effective powers. <br />But there are many powerful moments of  acting and  direction in Magnolia that I can mention. PT Anderson, and I am  nowhere  near the first person to have said this, is an actor's director.   He trusts them invariably to do their thing, and seems  loathe to stop  them. Hence, and thankfully, we have  Julianne Moore laying down some  serious character work  as a goldbricking wife with a change of heart; John  Reilly  turning leaden morality into a kind of suave sophisitication;  Tom  Cruise lampooning, very effectively, his  cocksure,  macho-man image as  cartoonish self-help guru Frank TJ  Mackey; William Macy as the man who  passed his prime  at age eight; and finally, pitching in around the  corners,  we have the Phillips, Baker Hall and Seymour Hoffman  (regulars,  along with Moore, Reilly, Macy, and Melora  Walters, in the Anderson  stable), who lend a grace and  dignity to the histrionic melodrama swirling  around them  in the pages of Anderson's script. <br />But Magnolia is, in the  end, Melora Walters' movie,  and if she is an unknown name to you (if you  haven't  seen her bit part in Boogie Nights or her strange, early  turn  alongside Chris Elliot in the execrable and under-  rated Cabin Boy) then  you really ought to tune in and  watch her go. Her character, an  egregiously wronged  and unstable daughter in a script full of familial  (and-all-  too-familiar), movie-of-the-week sin, becomes the  uncanny  center of a chaotic, mutinous sideshow. Does  she hold the film together?  Somehow, through her  conviction and her commitment to the sometimes   two-dimensional script, yes, she does. The film's  most memorable scenes  (and for me, the most well-  acted) are hers, and with her slight frame,  her hair  as strung out as her character, she wades into the  maelstrom and  passes through re-forged, unharmed,  and ready, one hopes, for a full-time,  successful  career. If somebody out there besides PT <br />Anderson doesn't  take Melora Walters seriously,  well, somebody better had. <br />But it is the  writing that does Magnolia in, as PT  Anderson panders to obviousness (the  child-genius  tells his father, \\"You have to start treating me better,\\"   and in a case of incest/molestation that did, or did not  happen, the  camera focuses on a nightmarish painting  on the victim's wall, and zooms  into the caption, \\"But it  really did happen.\\"). This was much the same  fault  Anderson made in Boogie Nights, which, when you take  away all the  hair-pulling, camera bravado, and jumping  about, becomes a darker kind of  after-school special  in which boy does good, boy does drugs, boy gets  strung  out, boy gets clean, and boy does good again. Obviousness  is a  problem Anderson will have to watch if he's going  to make good on his  promise of auteurism, a promise  which his &quot;style&quot; fairly screams  out. In order for me  to put him alonside Spike Jonze or David O. Russell   (1999's Being John Malkovich and Three Kings,  respectively), he'll have to  show some restraint,  learn to keep (as in Boogie Nights) the penis  hidden  from the camera and (as in Boogie Nights  and Magnolia) trust his audience  to do some  imaginative work on their own. He wants to show  us everything  (which can be good; Magnolia's  breathtaking, climactic, revelatory final  sequence  testifies to this); but most of the time he ends up  treating us  like t.v. baby knuckleheads, like horses  in need of the proverbial carrot.  The dramatic  frame, which enlists a television-like Believe it or  Not  format in order to excuse the rest of the  movie, is largely  throat-clearing, a useless,  nervous energy expended for the audience's   benefit (and therefore stylized pandering). PT  Anderson is in a tough  place, at once making  shadows like he might be the next auteur du  jour,  but then again too interested in being a  box-office success. He's going to  have to  decide, and soon, whether he really wants  the money or the blood.

6304712936|5.0|Amadeus is best watched and heard on DVD. The sound is clearer so  the miraculous music is heard PERFECTLY. The picture is more rich and colorful so you can enjoy every detail of the opulence in Vienna, the elegant  costume and opera sceneries. The story is magnificent. Milos Forman's  greatest work. We pity and feel terrified by Antonio Salieri. We laugh  along with Mozart's famous   laugh. Despite the darkness in Amadeus, there  is humor. Frau Webber is comedic as Mozart's mother in law. Particularily  funny is the scene when she is scolding Wolfgang and her increasingly  annoying voice turns into the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic  Flute. The mock opera in the &quot;common&quot; theatre, the Vaudeville is  very humorous as well. There are little things that make Amadeus a great  film, not excluding the greater things. There is a beauty to the music, the  showiness of the Emperor's palace, the opera houses with those blazing  chandaliers. DVD makes Amadeus more cinematic and more enjoyable. Sure..  it's an old film.. a lot of people would'nt care for it. But still.. there  is a greatness to the film of the fall of the world's greatest composer and  the music ! &quot;Music like has never been heard before&quot; Sir Neville  Marriner does a glorious work in the soundtrack. The Requiem focused in the  end is a masterpiece. The scenes of Mozart's death is awe-inspiring. See it  for yourself and enjoy a classic.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Well, she may not have the best voice and she certainly isn't pretending that what she is doing is art, but that's part of her charm.  &quot;Oops!...I Did It Again&quot; provides listeners with musical fluff.   Easy on the ears and very danceable, one of its most endearing qualities is  that Spears seems to know that what she is doing isn't groundbreaking.  She  doesn't write her own songs (with the exception of the musically weak but  heartfelt Dear Diary) and her vocal talents do not exceed those of most  randomly singing teensters, but she's having fun and taking listeners along  for the ride.  This album is great to walk or exercise to and if you're  willing to take a stand and admit that you like her, it's excellent party  music as well.
6304765231|5.0|Director Alex (Dark City) Proyas deserves credit for the finest comic to film adaptation so far. A dark and haunting film, The Crow tells the tale of a man who returns from the dead to avenge the murder of his beloved. The  actual crow in this film is his link, and his source of power, between the  world of the dead and the world of the living. Wonderful preformances all  around and the fact the film doesn't flinch from the violence that  heightens the drama makes The Crow an all time classic. But the thing that  stands this film apart is the death of the lead star Brandon Lee. It is  ironic that he was killed while playing a charater that that is killed only  to return, if briefly, from the dead.<br />It is this fact that makes The Crow  a much more dramatic and darker film. It gives everything in it an  undeniable sence of melancholy.<br />A must purchase.
B00000J7J4|4.0|... and who went for all the commercialism. I'm not sure, when you have some great music, why that aspect (ie, creating a viable moneymaker) should matter. I can honestly say I don't like the hip-hop elements much at all,  here, and I wish they weren't present... going from 'Smooth' into the mess  that is the intro to 'Do You Like the Way' is just unsettling, to say the  least, but as it gets into the meat of the music (and back to the guitar),  it becomes stand-able. I'm completely wild about the Latin tracks, tho I  know many consider some of the big names in this to be 'selling out' to the  Caucasian market (what a shame this distinction ever has to be made),but I  am enjoying them all tremendously and am thankful they want to make music I  will listen to and buy. 'Put Your Lights On' w/Everlast is pretty amazing,  and this is from an old lady who does NOT listen to stuff like this! If  they can leave out the hip-hop the next time around, the CD will be even  hotter than this one, if such a thing is possible. I can't wait to put this  into the Bose in the car!
6304613199|1.0|'Jurrasic Park' is a landmark film, one of the best adventure films ever made and one of the greatest FX films of all time. Then comes the sequel - 'The Lost World'. This uninspired hack job of the wonderful book is an  insult to the magic of the first film. Boring characters and a decidedly  unoriginal plot, which includes the King Kong rip-off sequence in which a  T-Rex is running amock through the city, makes this one of Spielberg's  worst films. I, like so many people, was simply devastated by it. Not even  the great FX could salvage it. Avoid this movie.
0590353403|5.0|What a fantastic book!  You don't have to be a child to enjoy it,  heck, I'm a 30 year old Muggle who loved this book. It was really enjoyable to read about the complex char and getting to know &quot;Harry Potter&quot; language. *LOL* I can't wiat to read the rest of the series.

B000002NHN|5.0|I first started listening to Loreena Mckennitt's music about 7 months ago. My first CD I got was &quot;The Visit&quot;, since that time I have purchased several others.  For some reason, &quot;The Book of Secrets&quot;  was the last album I bought.  That was a mistake.  As soon as I got done  listening to her mysterious &quot;Prologue&quot;, I was entranced in  wonder.  How can such Music be produced, except by Loreena.  Every song in  this CD I love!   Usually when you get CD's (as with her other albums), I  always have some songs I don't care for as much as others.  But each song  in this glorious album fills the soul with such glorified happiness and  fulfillment that you have to listen to it again and again.  This is Loreena  Mckennitt at her very best!  From the Prologue to Night Ride Across the  Caucasus, this CD is filled with a Celtic flare and an Inspiring  English/Middle Eastern touch.  It revives you.  I also want to comment on  the lyrics in her songs.  If you get this CD (as with her other albums),  make SURE you read the lyrics while she is singing.  The meaning and the  story in them is wonderful.  The Highwayman for instance, is a beautiful  sounding song with a majestic/hearty english awe about it.  But just read  the lyrics and you will see that the song is a love song that will touch  your heart, and make you cry.    I could go on and on about this CD, but  will refrain.  My favourite track is, of course, the Mummer's Dance!   That  song is the best that Loreena has ever done!  I think the readers of this  review will get my point...BUY THIS CD!   It is Loreena Mckennitt at her  best!
B00000ICD9|4.0|This film had so many possibilities.  Remember all those flying people?  We see several nuns on the steps near the water, but none of them were flying.  It would have been a hoot to see Sally Fields in a cameo of her  &quot;Flying Nun&quot; character.
6301966562|5.0|What else can I say that hasn't already been said?  This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  Love the music and the sappy but romatic storyline!<br />Can't wait 'til the price comes down so I can add it to my  video collection... when might that be... hmmmm?
0783226888|5.0|The Jackal is a great action movie, though some of my favorite scenes are more humerous than action oriented. Particularly a scene where Bruce Willis' character and another fellow test out a gattling gun. I thought  that other fellow was absolutly hilarious and really made this movie for  me. Unfortunatly with these older collectors edition movies, then tend to  cost quit a bit more, but I think the extra cost is worth it. This movie  has a lot of twists and turns for someone who hasn't previously seen it,  but once you've seen it a couple times, it loses the shock value, and just  becomes a cool action movie. This is definetly a movie I would recommend  adding to your dvd collection.
031218087X|1.0|In the mood for suspending my belief, I packed &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; on a trip to Orlando and was amazed at how all those Orlando attractions now attained a level of incredible plausibility.  Ostensibly  the story of how a computer programmer creates a virtually unbreakable  code, the eponymous &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;, setting off a  global-manhunt for the only conceivable key, the novel never grows out of a  great idea, never offers remotely plausible or even appealing charachters,  and never creates any tension.  By the end, when secrets are revealed, what  should be  major plot twist has long been undermined by plot contrivances  and fake charachters.  I should have seen the warning signs - the Author  describes the NSA in terms of how many Americans are aware of it.  In one  swipe, the author identifies his readers by their ignorance of the setting  and insures us that much of our suspense will thus rely on our not having  seen &quot;Sneakers&quot; or &quot;Good Will Hunting&quot;.  <br />Further  complicating things is the ends by which the author neglects the cause of  pluasibility:  The denizens of NSA headquarters are so dim, it's  inconceivable that they'd be able to run an ISP, let alone the most  sophisticated code-breaking computer in the world.  Our hero is a bookworm  in somewhat adequate shape, but the author presents no credible reason to  explain his survivability against one of the world's deadliest assasins;   The assassin is a bit of a cheat himself - using a PDA (?) to phone in his  kills before their dead.  Once it becomes apparent that the key to  &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; might be engraved on a ring worn by its  creator, prolongoing the hunt for the code-key, the author fails to create  sense that the hit man might be better off tracking down the ring than our  hero.  Instead, and for reasons unknown, the assassin remains forever  two-steps behind.  Much of the tension of &quot;Digital Fortress&quot;  involves just that - the hero tracking down the mysterious code-key ring in  Spain, and boy it gets tired fast, with the hero tracking the ring down  from one owner to the next.  But plausbility isn't what the author is  looking for.  <br />By the time that &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; reaches a  climax, I couldn't care whether the NSA would be destroyed by the killer  code, mostly because the author had by then changed from telling a story to  giving a pitch for some splashy action movie, making the novel's Hollywood  aspirations annoyingly clear.  Throw away the key!
080017948X|5.0|I thought Bill Murray was the perfect person to play this role, and I think its one of the funniest movies I have seen. The idea of having to live the same day over and over again is a great setting for Bill Murray's  talents to shine. I love all the situations he puts himself into, for  example the numerous suicide attempts and how he eventually learns anything  and everything about everyone in the entire town. If you haven't seen this  movie yet, definetly go check it out.
B000002KHY|5.0|This is a great CD. Makes me mellow and makes me remember the past. Sometimes best of albums are the best buy. Get this one. And I do not personally know cydneyday but I kinda like her reviews. I read her profile  after that nasty comment from some reviewer. He must not get it. I like her  personal touches not just saying whats on the cd or in the book. She seems  okay to me. Stay mellow and buy James Taylor today.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjork is the next Madonna. In 2000 and beyond, we will probably see and hear Bjork as much as we have Madonna. Post is Bjork's first flat-out masterpiece. Song such as &quot;Army of Me&quot; and &quot;Enjoy&quot; boil  will all the rage of eighties metal, only Bjork traps them in techno  cocoons and demands that you find the beauty in the metallic scraping and  electronic beeps. &quot;Hyperballad&quot; is her best song yet, a paranoid  techno lullaby with beautiful strings and pounding drums backing her lovely  voice. Any fan of alternative or dance music must own this CD. I have  listened to this album so many times and it never gets old. It just gets  better.
0679735909|4.0|Possession, labeled a romance, is certainly that.  But it is also much, much more.  The book is a tremendous undertaking of style and verve, a romance on two levels, and a bizarre detective story all rolled into  one.<br />The main characters of Possesion are Roland Michell, a true academic  and Maud Bailey, a researcher, but the stars of the book are really the  long-dead R.H. Ash and Christabel LaMotte.<br />In Possession, Byatt gives  much attention to minor detail.  In fact, her detailing is so subtle that  many nuances may be missed on a first reading.<br />Byatt's writing is  beautiful and filled with simple, descriptive language and gorgeous  imagery.  The majority of the story is rich in both metaphor and allusion,  with the following passage being a prime example:  &quot;One night they  fell asleep, side by side, on Maud's bed, where they had been sharing a  glass of Calvados.  He slept curled against her back, a dark comma against  her pale elegant phrase.&quot;<br />Most of the chapters in Possession begin  with a fictitious work by Ash or LaMotte, but Byatt has not only written  them well, she has fashioned each so that it is in keeping with the  character of its fictitious author.<br />Ash and LaMotte are both of the  Romantic period, yet Ash is more open and free than is LaMotte, who writes  with obvious rhyme and rhythm.  It is this--Byatt's ability to create so  many different writing styles for each of her characters and fit them to  the character so perfectly, that makes Possession come to life for the  reader.<br />Possession is not a straightforward narrative, however.  Much of  the story is told through the letters of Ash and LaMotte, again,  beautifully crafted by Byatt. It is through their letters that we really  get to know Ash and LaMotte as well as Roland and Maud.  The knowledge  gained in the past relationship between Ash and LaMotte allows the  present-day relationship between Roland and Maud to come to  life.<br />Possession is a storyof lost romantic love and, as such, it may  seem, at first glance, to be just another trite book on a trite and  overly-written subject.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Byatt  has conferred a freshness of outlook on Possession that makes it unlike any  other novel of failed romance and love gone wrong.<br />Roland and Maud are,  without a doubt, two quite ordinary people.  But Byatt has given them  something quite extraordinary to do.  These two would-be lovers are  actually on a quest, and their lives, as well as their love, seem to mirror  and parallel Ash and LaMotte's in more ways than one.<br />But all is  certainly not smooth sailing for Roland and Maud.  Roland has Val, his  live-in lover to deal with and Val, unlike many an &quot;unwanted&quot;  lover is not a woman to be summarily dismissed.<br />What really makes  Possession sparkle and sets it apart from any other typical romance is the  connection Roland and Maud have to the past and to Ash and LaMotte.  This  adds a mystical, almost surreal, quality to the story that could have so  easily turned maudlin in the hands of a writer less talented than Byatt.   Byatt, however, intertwines past and present with perfection and keeps the  reader spellbound with the suspension of disbelief.<br />A few passages  containing expletives seem out of place in this otherwise dazzling novel  and really seem beneath the obvious talent and ability of a first-class  writer like Byatt.<br />Byatt has titled her novel perfectly.  The word,  &quot;possession,&quot; crops out several times throughout the story:  the  possession of the stolen letters, the possession of the lovers to each  other, the possession of the past to the present.  Byatt obviously began  working with the motif of possession in mind.<br />While certainly not of the  romance genre, Possession contains enough romance to satisfy even the most  voracious.  The characters are creations of tremendous depth and we find it  easy to love them or hate them or pity them, but never dismiss them.<br />The  intertwining plots work on many levels and work so well that many readers  will often find themselves wondering if the story is purely fiction or  based in reality.<br />Finally, the beautiful writing captures and holds the  reader's attention and adds to the fantasy that is unfolding.  Although  some readers might find the many letters and poems contained in this book  distracting, they do enrich the story and lend a depth that would  definitely be lost had Byatt failed to included them.<br />A finely-crafted  novel of parallel lives and parallel loves, Possession is, for the most  part, a lyrical look, not at what really was, but what so easily could have  been.
B000001E7V|4.0|Tricky is a genius. He a musical puzzle consisting of all different types of musuc (hip hop, jazz, rock, techno, soul, folk). This combination adds up to a wildly flavored mix of urban masterpieces, perfect for headphone  zone-out times. His voice is raspy and damaged, but it only makes his music  better. His music carries undertones of darkness and even homicidal mania,  but Tricky pulls it off in a somehow beautiful way, thanks in part to his  femal vocalist, Martine. It's a fantastic album for anyone interested in  finding out what the REAL future of alternative music sounds like.

B00003CWTI|4.0|Paul Anderson, like Brian Singer, is one of todays most important, watchable directors. While I didn't think this movie was as good as his opus Boogie Nights, I still feel that it was 99% beter than most of the  stuff that was released in 1999.I can't fathom why some people, critics  included, found this film hard to understand. In a way, it had one of the  simplest of plots of Anderson's movies. It just threw a lot of characters  at you. But once you get past the introduction, with its kaliope music and  swirling camera angles, the film settles in to the simple, beautiful story  of reconciliation, showcased in 3 vignettes; that of Jason Robards family,  that of Baker-Halls family and that of Bill Macys story. To say that the  acting by everyone, down to the children, is superb would be redundant, as  Anderson utilizes many of the same actors from his 2 previous, wonderful  films. Back again are the incredible talents of william H Macy, Baker-Hall,  Julianne Moore, Seymour-Thomas,John Reily and many more that once again  show their acting prowess. More credit to them, is the fact that the same  director keeps using them in his films, yet we keep getting different,  unique chacracter portrayals each time. On board this time, in addition,  are most notably Tom Cruise and Jason Robards. Cruise was once again again  ripped off by not getting the best supprting actor oscar ( I wouldn't want  to have been the one to try to determine who was a supprting actor &amp;  who was a lead actor in this film!). He desrved the oscar here, giving a  magnetic performance with such jumpy electricity not seen from Cruise since  the Color of Money. Robards was also incredibly effective, given his  charcaters state of being. Robards has been under used in the 80's &amp;  90's, and we quickly remember some of his best, past performances (such as  in Johnny Got His Gun) while watching this movie! Along with the  &quot;regulars&quot;, director Anderson gives us a truly moving movie that  tackles depressing subjects while never pandering to humanity's baser  nature, which is something that a lot of 1999 films were guilty of (  American Beauty, Boys Dont Cry...). The only thing that keeps me from  giving this 5 stars is the bit of the silly, Biblical plague-like ending  which attempted to unite all of the plot threads. I don't think that that  was neccessary. I thought all of the stories and characters stood up nicely  on their own. I can't wait for the DVD release to see if there's anything  that Anderson left on the cuting room floor( you might think that thats  impossible with a 3 hour movie, but check out the 9 deleted scenes from  Boogie Nights DVD, and that movie ran over 2 &amp; 1/2 hours!)
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight was the first fantasy novel I ever stumbled upon at the bookstore shelf and I could not have hoped for a better introduction. 8 years and 20-odd Dragonlance books later, it still stands  as the best. Without going into too much detail, suffice it to say that the  world of Krynn is the most well-conceived in all of fantasy literature (and  that includes middle-earth). The most amazing thing, though, is the depth  of the characters and the way that Weis and Hickman can make even ordinary  conversations between them spellbinding. Not to mention that Raistlin is  probably the coolest character ever. If you're looking for a good  introduction to fantasy literature then look no further.
6303426468|5.0|My boyfriend thought it was both funny and compassionate. Although neither of us particularly cared for twins, there was something hillarious about a pregnant man who is played by an actor usually associated with all of the  &quot;Macho action roles&quot;<br />In all fairness, I don't think it would  have been the same if they had Devito or even a smaller built actor in the  role. Because the casting was psychologically atypical for a  physiologically atypical movie, it made all of the difference in the world.<br />Myself and many other women flocked to see this movie (even if we were  still single and childless) because of the fantasies. Although wearing the  &quot;Pregnancy suit&quot; must have not been easy, one can applaud  Schwarzenegger for taking on the role---a move probally not appreciated in  some (but thankfully not all) segments of his fan base.<br />This is  problally by far one of Arnold's few movies that plays on female non-sexual  fantasies. It is also the best movie to rent around that certain time.
052594527X|3.0|Once started, Girl With a Pearl Earring is difficult to put down.  There are no quirky characters or exciting plot twists, yet you are drawn into Griet's world, and want to know what becomes of her.  The book can be  easily read in a weekend, and is perfect for a short &quot;escape&quot;.   While there was little about the book to ponder after putting it aside, it  is a wonderful book for anyone curious about art or history.
B00003CXCS|5.0|I have not yet seen the DVD of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but I know it has a ton of thing, when it will be coming out Aug 29, 2000. I have ordered a copy of the DVD from amazon.com  The movie is timeless because of  the music it brings into your life, just like the songs do. It's full of  happiness and joy and most of all it shows the love of a family and the  care that they show for one another. I have seen the VHS tape and watch it  at different times when it has aired yearly on NBC. It's a great musical  for the entire family. If you have not seen it yet, buy a copy before it's  too late. It's the greatest gift of all, if you are looking for a family  musical! Buy it for your friend or for yourself today!
B00004TH83|5.0|I love Celine Dion and Barbra Streisand, so when I read the reviews of most other customers about Lara Fabian, had to order this cd RIGHT AWAY!   She is just wonderful.  She's just starting, and she's got IT already!    When comparing her to Celine Dion now, it is unfair.  Celine had a  fantastic voice then, and the &quot;polishing&quot; came as she sang, along  with the self-confidence.  This young lady has got to have a great future  in music with her voice. As one of the comments I read said--&quot;she  sounds a lot like Celine&quot;, but she's got her own style already. She's  singing in my car when I drive to and from work, and also at home when just  relaxing!    Thank you Amazon, and your customers comments.  Hurry out  with another cd, Lara, before this one wears out. You are GREAT!

0780631153|5.0|It took some convincing for me to actually go to a theater to see a movie with Tom Cruise in it. But i did, and it was one of the top best decisions i've made this year so far. I could never understand why i hear this movie  being called &quot;boring.&quot;  Magnolia had me laughing, angry, and in  tears. Julianne Moore's angry pharmacy scene was fantastic and powerful.  With the movie's brilliant variety of characters, you will find someone to  relate to in this movie. Magnolia gives its audiences subject topics that  we all deal with at some point of our lives, directly or indirectly, but  nonetheless we are faced with these topics: death, abuse, adultery,  nonexistent relationships between relatives, drug use, insecurity, the  desire to always succeed, and the yearning to find someone who will love  you unconditionally.  I probably forgot to mention some stuff because just  thinking about this movie gets me feeling like i'm still in the theater.  All these characters have obvious flaws that they bring to the screen with  realness.  This isn't about Hollywood glamor and wealth.  Magnolia has such  an eerie, breathtaking way of making you feel at home.
B00001YXH5|5.0|After I bought Saltinbanco and Nouvelle Experience (both from Cirque du Soleil), I like Quidam as the best of the three. My autistic daugther enjoy these videos and can mantain her atention for a lot of time. I thing she  would recomend the cirque du Soleil videos if she can talk.
B00003CWLF|3.0|OK widescreen lovers, time to jump all over this review.  This was a passable movie and I probably would have bought the DVD.  However I have learned that the aspect ratio is 2.35:1 widescreen.  I can tolerate the  1.85:1 but I have to like a movie a lot before buying something which  wastes half my TV screen.<br />When are they going to stop forcing this  ridiculous format down our throats and give us a choice of ratios?  You  know darn well they are producing a 1.33:1 version for VHS so it's out  there.  I don't quibble with those who want to see the movie &quot;as the  director intended&quot; and there was some beautiful scenery which would  suffer in a pan-and-scan format.  However I don't think any director  intended us to have to watch their production at the size offered by most  TV's (under 54&quot; projections) anyway.<br />Give us a choice!   The  producers are jumping the gun on the available TV technology.  By the time  the 16x9 TV's are out in any numbers, the DVD as we know it may be  obsolete! <br />I don't know about you, but for any &quot;good&quot; movie,  the aspect ratio(s) offered are a deciding factor for me - scratch this one  off my list.
B00004THAY|5.0|Put these two gifted artists together and you can only have musical magic!  There is not a wasted cut or guitar lick!  The two voices are unique yet complementary!<br />Only drawback:  Should have been double-length to match  the stature of these greats!

B0000039PW|5.0|&quot;Ready to Die,&quot; is by far the best rap album ever. There is, nor will there ever be another album that comes close to this album, or the legacy accompanies it. Notorious BIG shows why he earned the title  &quot;King of New York&quot; on this amazing compilation of hard tracks.  The songs range from the street life; murder, drugs, and robbery, to the  ladies;pimping, loving and friendship to the challenges of life in the  Ghetto. The lyrics on this album are the best I have ever heard. Incredibly  clever, humorous, and vivid is an understatement! If your looking for an  album that you can just play through because each song has unique and tells  vivid story, &quot;Ready to Die&quot; is the album your looking for.  Notorious BIG is the greatest rapper that will ever live, and this album is  why.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is the World's Greatest Rock and Roll band doing what they do best. They blend blues, country, r&amp;b, and even gospel and it still sounds like Rock n Roll. Who's Next is the only album that even compares with this  one. The thing that makes it all so much better is the live emotion that  resulted from a good portion of it being recorded in Keith Richard's  basement. It almost feels like it is something from some garage band not  caring about money but just wanting to make amazing music. I'll have to  admit, it didn't take that well at first, but for me, a lot of Stones stuff  didn't. Now, after listening to it over and over, like the rest of the  Stones stuff, I love it. It is more of a complete album than any of there  other releases. Although Rip This Joint, Rocks Off, Sweet Virginia,  Tumbling Dice, and Happy are among my favorites, after a while, you begin  to realize that it is meant to be played start to stop or not at all.  Amazing album that everyone with a pulse should own.
0385484518|5.0|This is the kind of book that one must revisit at least once a year.  The first time I read it, I closed the book with a feeling of awe and enlightenment at the final revelations and lectures of Morrie.  Mitch  Albom's historical record of an amazing teacher's final months and final  struggle with a dibilatating disease showed sensitivity and bravery rarely  found in fiction or non-fiction alike. But, in order for the lessons of the  book to truly work their wonders, I believe I will reread this book every  couple months, just to remind myself how special life really is.
6305897786|1.0|This film had such great potential.  It started to be a very interesting story that I couldn't wait to see get fully developed... unfortunetly it never did and just ended in a VERY POOR way.  <br />I don't think that I have  seen a movie that takes me from wow this is cool to what happened... what a  waist of money.<br />I think the review from tokieyasu says it perfect... and  I paraphrase...<br />&quot;To be honest the ending stinks.<br />Again what is so  horrible about this film is that for over an hour and a half this film is  very good. It is a great film that piques your interest. I could not wait  to find out what this book was and why it was so important. And what does  the film do with this intelligent plot and our interest? The film breaks  down into a poorly acted and stupid ending.<br />What a waste of a movie that  was almost very good.&quot; --tokieyasu
6305537798|5.0|It was really cool! Reason why I love it:<br />01. It was funny, even though alot of swearing.<br />02. Julia Stiles is hot, and can dance!<br />03. I love Larisa Oleynik.<br />04. Great music<br />05. Cool stars!<br />06. Andrew Keegan  gets what he's asking for! <br />SO GO RENT IT!
B00002ND77|5.0|This in my opinion, is without a doubt, Spike Lee's best. This movie is very long, but, I don't think that you could get all of Malcolm's life into the big screen if it were a 5 hour movie.   Great story-Great video-Great  audio (for this type of movie), uplifting, and very sad. This is one movie  I could watch a million times and it would still move me.

B00004RHZU|5.0|This CD explores love, hate, and the instances when the two are wrapped into one.  Stop Falling and Let Me Let You Know are the two slowest, sweetest, and most honest songs on the CD; she sings of how she's not  looking for someone perfect, but real love.  Split Personality examines her  conflicting emotions of love; in other tracks she urges everyone to  &quot;make their own rules&quot; and sport their real selves.  Her voice  never waivers in this awesome CD.

B00004SCX6|1.0|Sorry Britney, but this CD is just like the first one!  If you're not sure you want to buy this CD, let me give you some advice -- DON'T DO IT!   All of her fast songs are the same and so are her poorly sung ballads.  This CD  makes me wonder why some people just can't see (or should I say hear?) real  talent!
B00003CX59|5.0|I don't think this movie deserves 5 stars. I deserves 6!<br />Starting with the dark, yet beautifully filmed scenery, great stoy and wonderful acting, I don't think it could have been done any better.<br />Johnny Depp shows great  talent, and it everything I invisioned Icahbod Crane should be. He speaks  well, looks adorable =) and is able to inject a little humor in certain  scenes. And who can beat all that fainting? Christina Ricci is almost  unrecognizable. She is carries herself rather well, with a lovely voice to  follow. Young Masbeth also does a great job, as does the rest of the  cast.<br />This acting combined with great scenery and a great script makes a  great movie. The action scenes are filled with tension and humor. Leave it  to Tim Burton to create such a beautuful and humor-filled movie.
1573225517|5.0|Not only is this book about commitment, it also is about being wrapped up in yourself, unable to accept that you aren't the only person with tastes.  I handed this book to someone I saw as similar to the protagonist, though  without sympathy or feelings for change, and he totally missed any hint of  that.  Aside from that taint, the book is excellent in satirizing us men's  inability to grow up and become rational mates.  Someday, ladies.
0552137030|5.0|Excellent book. There are other excellent books by Terry, but read this! It's worth it. You'll be glad you did.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Probably America's most controversial rapper makes one hell of a return.  I really wasn't too big of a fan of Eminem's Slim Shady LP.  Sure, it was ok, had a few good songs.  Marshall Mathers on the other hand is anything  and everything a rap fan can ask for.  <br />It still has all the profane  music in Slim Shady, but it is different profane music.  Eminem bashes  parents who aren't guiding their children well.  He bashes boy/girl bands  and homosexuals.  He really offends... everyone.  He has a point though  that parents shouldn't let their children listen to this stuff.  He is  never racist though.  My favorite tracks are Stan, Who Knew, The Real Slim  Shady, Marshall Mathers, Drug Ballad, and also Criminal.<br /> Last and  definently not least.  If you are a parent DON'T buy this for anyone under,  say 14 (thats even pushing it).  Even the edited version is probably bad.   If you are dumb enough to buy this for kids, Eminem has all the right to  bash you he wants!
0345409671|5.0|I must say this is Anne Rice's best novel. It was very interesting to read that Lestat was afraid of Something or Someone for once! I thought Rice's(or shall we say Lestat's or Memnoch's) depictions of Heaven and  Hell, and the Creation were interesting. Sure, if we attended Sunday school  or practice Christianity we heard this a million times. But this is  different. It has a twist to it. It is from the Devil's point of view, and  Rice makes the Devil seem, well, not as evil as we think he is.<br />This book  makes you think about your views on Christianity, or any religion involving  any god. On a whole, this book was wonderful, and I reccomend this book to  anyone, especially Anne Rice fans.
0345418336|5.0|But I loved the whole damn thing.
6305807086|5.0|Despite quite a few stinkers, 1999 turned out to be a great year for variety at the movies. Think back on some of the unconventional films you wouldn't have expected to see in a cineplex 10 years ago:  &quot;Dogma,&quot; &quot;Magnolia,&quot; &quot;The Blair Witch  Project,&quot; &quot;Three Kings,&quot; &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;...While  I'm not a fan of all those films, they at least tried something new, and  &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; stood head and shoulders above the crowd  as the weirdest, most original film of the year. And, to these eyes, the  best.<br />Entire cans of alphabet soup have been spilled trying to describe  and praise the movie. Let me just praise the DVD. First of all, it contains  the movie. Always a good thing. It has the trailer, which hooked many of us  the moment we saw it: &quot;This looks completely twisted. I have to see  it.&quot; It has the complete video documentary of the career of John  Horatio Malkovich, Genius Puppeteer. It has a strange interview with Spike  Jonze and an even stranger visit with one of the movie's extras. It even  has a segment on the real-life puppeteer who did all the puppeteering for  Cusack in the film. It also has the complete video documentary on the  history of the 7 1/2 floor. What more could you want? <br />If you saw and  loved the movie, you need to buy this DVD even if you don't have a DVD  player, just so you can take it out once in a while and look at it and say  &quot;I have this on DVD.&quot; If you do have a DVD player and you saw and  loved the movie, but you haven't bought the DVD yet, you're just being mean  to yourself.
0446310492|5.0|This book is the number 1 best book on my list and should on yours. It very touching and makes you think a little.
B00003CWTI|4.0|This is one of the better films of '99, but nonetheless overrated and hardly deserving of much rigorous analysis.  If it wasn't encumbered by pretentious symbolism and a feel-good stench that becomes pervasive by the  last few minutes, the simple storytelling ability and innovative narrative  structure would make it a superb work. <br />Very believable characters are  Magnolia's greatest strength.  Despite the wide range of social class and  personality, every character has human weaknesses and strengths--no one  figure stands out as a hero, except perhaps a loyal hospice nurse (Phillip  Seymour Hoffman).  I was struck by the (chilling) realism of the  relationship between whiz kid Stanley, mature beyond his years and his  greedy, childish father.  <br />The plot works well enough when left to  itself, but the director makes the mistake of rushing to tie all the ends  up after most of the action has occurred.  The stories were solid enough on  their own!  And like too many recent films, the soundtrack adds nothing  (sometimes even obscuring dialogue and real noise), and seems to be merely  a vehicle for promoting new artists.<br />Finally, the attempts at a larger  message don't work at all; quasi-cryptic phrases repeated mechanically by  different characters, the strange precipitation (funny, but not profound),  and weather forecasts don't seem to combine effectively for any unifiying  theme.
0385333846|4.0|This was a book I bought after hearing about several of my english teachers and peers rave about it. They claimed it was wonderfully written, excellent satire, and funny, so that is what I expected. The problem was  that as with many overly hyped things they can not live up to your  expectation. There was good news with this book, however, it was very  intriguing and unique. The style of writing, the story itself, and the  characters are all quirky and engaging. It is a very quick read and a book  that once you get started you will not want to put down. The problems I had  with it, however, were that it was very disjointed (which as you read it  you will understand the importance of it, though you may not like reading  it)and after I was done I didn't really care about any of the characters or  the story--it is behind me down and I will not be going to all of my  friends telling them that this is a must read.    All in all, I think this  book is one you should get from the library, read in an afternoon and  return. It is not one that you will need to have around your house because  you will never have to reference it again and while it is enjoyable it  would be one that would have made me happier to have borrowed that  purchased.
B000031EGV|1.0|Chris Van Allsburg's brisk, haunting storybook is turned into yet another Robin Williams vehicle about getting in touch with your feelings. Williams stars as Alan, a guy trapped for 26 years in the magical board game  Jumanji. When orphans Kirsten Dunst and Bradley Pierce find the game and  roll the dice, they release Alan as well as various marauding beasts that  flatten the sleepy suburbs. The movie gives Alan a cold father who comes  back to haunt him in the form of a psychotic game hunter (both are played  by Jonathan Hyde). The hunter, one can't help noticing, has a big gun.  Freudians should have a field day with the movie: It's crammed with  phallic/vaginal threats, plus constant images of cathartic violation. The  animals, demolishing suburban propriety, are primal therapists.<br />Bonnie  Hunt turns up as Alan's now-grown-up childhood sweetheart, who must spell  out the movie's subtext: The stampeding beasts, and Jumanji itself, are  manifestations of Alan's repressed anger at Dad. Why spend $65 million and  thousands of hours sweating over computers to make a banal fable about the  hazards of bottling up your anger? The animals do put on a show, but some  of them -- particularly the lion and the monkeys, the ones with the most  articulation in their features -- look jerky and plasticized. In format,  &quot;Jumanji&quot; is a mild retread of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (the  director, Joe Johnston, is supposed to direct the third &quot;JP&quot;),  complete with the nuclear family of the guy, the woman, and the two  parentless kids who all come together while fighting or fleeing from  computer-generated critters. It was said to be too scary for kids, but the  scariest thing about it is that it took three guys to write a screenplay  this repetitive and psychologically glib.
B000002A33|4.0|This album is pretty good. While this band are supposedly labeled to hard rock, it's more mellow than angry(unlike some of the other Seattle grungers). The music is very soft, relaxing and hypnotising while still   being able to make you move your two feet. Mark Lanegan's smooth, mellow  vocals combines brilliantly with the acoustic but rapid guitaring. The  songs sound more like tunes and each tune makes you drift away some place  different each time you hear it.There is't a one weak song on the album the  ones which immediatly catches the eye are the wonderful 'Halo of Ashes',  'All I Know', and 'Gospel Plow'.                                                                           On the negative side, this album is slightly  overproduced and Lanegan's voice can be inclined to become boring if you  spend a long period of time listening to it. It's an album that you could  listen to for a half an hour either in the morning to wind you up or in the  evening to wind down and relax.                                                                                           As I havn't heard any previous  work from the Screaming Trees I cannot make any comparisons but I can say  that as a novice to the band I'm impressed, money well spent and that I'm  looking forward to hearing more of their stuff.
B00003CWTH|1.0|What an piece of garbage. Terrible, over-the-top acting, stupid and offensive characters, abundant profanity, drug addiction, pyschoses, wailing, knashing of teeth, biblical plagues, misery, sorrow, regret, yada  yada yada. A 3-hour paean to over-indulgent, narcissistic directing. I want  my money back.
B00003CXDU|5.0|For anyone who has liked Star Trek or laughed at people who do, this is a must-have.  GalaxyQuest is a very well-written spoof of Star Trek and goes over every detail, from actors working the convention block to &quot;I am  not Spock.&quot;  Grab it.  Rent it.  It's simply that good!
B00003CXAR|5.0|I was excited when this terrific movie finally made it to DVD, even more excited to know that was is available in DTS. Well let me tell you now that this DTS version is super. The quality of this movie is excellent in every  way. The sound is 100% better now than it ever was complete directional  sound and pwerful rear speaker output. Bass response is very good and deep.  The picture is presented in it's original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and it looks  good. The color quality is sharp and very focused. We all know what the  story is about so if you have DTS in your home theatre go and get this DTS  version. There are extra features on this disc including the making of JAWS  and trivia. Very well produced DVD and it looks like it was made yesterday.  Thanks Universal and a thank you to Steven Spielberg. A treasure to keep.

0792153367|5.0|To describe this movie in one word.....: you really can't.  This movie has so many sides to it.  The characters, the plot, the emotions.  All of it is drawn together flawlessly into a timeless classic.  I loved this movie.   Audrey Hepburn was fantastic and should have gotten an Oscar.  All other  actors including the Japanese guy put out performances that were  outstanding.  I have never, ever, felt so good after watching a movie than  I did after watching this.  Whether you get DVD or VHS, you will love it  and cherish it for many years.  Definately recommended.
6305858764|3.0|I entered this movie with high expectations as the book is very highly spoken of.  The characters were somewhat shallow, and I did not find Matt Damon particularly believable as a murderer.  His actions come out of  nowhere and you just don't see or feel the psycho that is obviously lurking  beneath the surface.  The few scenes where you do see it seem staged.  Gwyneth Paltrows talents were not put to good use; you hardly get to know  her character.              Still, the movie has an eerie tone to it and  builds suspense effectively; if only it had led to a more satisfying  ending.  The scenery and sets were stunning, and the music added to the  creepy ambiance.
B00004SCX6|1.0|No, no, no! I strongly discourage you from buying this album! This girl may have some talent but it is no apparent on this CD. With her huge lack of writing credits and her odd vocal range why would she want this to reach  the public. It offers no portion of her true-self, seeing as she only  co-wrote one song. I'm sorry I cannot recommend a CD with such a horrible  cover song as 'Satisfaction' - it was done great in the Julia Roberts movie  'Satisfaction' aka 'Girls of Summer.'  The entire album reaks of bubble gum  trash re-engineered to make the listener think it's something new. I can  only Britney will soon stop tossing us ABC (already been chewed) material  and offering something original and from her own mind.
0671034065|5.0|This book was well worth the hard cover price.  Once I picked it up I could not put it down.  The dialouge was so witty I was laughing out loud.  I even read some of the better conversations Jaine and Sam had to my  husband and had him laughing.  I love the fact that Linda Howards  characters are hot!   I get tired of the tepid love scenes in other novels.   I agree with one reviewer that the murderer was a bit easy to figure out  but other than that I have to say that Mr. Perfect was just about PERFECT!
0783246641|1.0|Well here we go with some originality. A &quot;comedy&quot;, or is it a satire, about the Eighties. In my opinion it's merely an excuse for bloodletting and Christian Bale to strip down all the time. I found it's  intellectual content to be shallow, acting to be marginial, and it's  moralistic overtone to be questionable. First of all why does it require  death and violence to be a satire on America in the Eighties and second of  all since when has multiple homicides been humorous? Looking over the  reviews I'm not sure what I found to be worse. the fact that so many talk  about the laughs that broke out during the murders or the folks who go on  and on about the Eighties soundtrack and clothes. Perhaps the real  statement about the American way of life should be the lack of reaction  that this movies didn't invoke from people. I dare say we aren't so far  removed from the Romans as we may think.
0790729628|5.0|A must for believers in the universe that includes William Gibson, Samuel Delaney, Robert Heinlein and Thomas Pynchon.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD need not be taken seriously and you definetly have to 'get a sense of humor' (which Eminem suggests in Who Knew)before listening to this. This CD is way phat and has unbelievable ryhmes. I agree that it could be  percieved as offensive by many, but this CD is so full of hilarity and wit,  it cannot be passed up. The songs have many references to inappropreiate  things, but if you listen to this with a sense of humor, it is definetly  the most enjoyable Cd yet to have come from the head of this phenomenon.
B00000I8UE|5.0|Before listening to this album, listen to the original &quot;Blue in Green&quot; from Miles Davis' &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; album at least a dozen times.  Listen enough so that you begin to anticipate every note from  his trumpet.  Then, and only then, listen to Cassandra's version (Sky and  Sea) on this album.  You'll appreciate it that much more.  Also, get  Cassandra's homage to the blues, Blue Light 'Til Dawn.
6305537798|2.0|The writers do a terrific job of setting up the premise of a high school so ruled by cliques that it even has a sizable cowboy crowd, and the actors--Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, Larry Miller, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and especially Allison Janney as a wisecracking guidance counselor--are as charming as they could possibly be. Unfortunately, the writers--having taken \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" as the template for their story--run out of direct parallels to Shakespeare early on, and they can't replace them with anything except the usual, tiresome teen-movie cliches and leaden, disposable dialogue. Worst of all, Janney--whose presence really enlivens the early scenes--disappears before the movie is half-over. This movie was a big disappointment to me, but I wish nothing but great things for these wonderful actors.
B000009RC2|5.0|Head music from some of the biggest heads in the world of music.  Blistering guitar, haunting rhythms, visionary melodies.  This might be the greatest album I've ever heard.  These gentlemen, unlike many musicians out  there, truly know what music is for.
6305905401|3.0|This movie had so much potential.  Unfortunately, it never lived up to it.  It was almost emotionless.<br />Johnny Depp plays a suave antique book dealer that excels in screwing people moneywise.  He always gets his book.  His  reputation leads an equally unscrupulous book collector Frank Langella to  seek out his services.  The service he wants him to perform, is to examine  the companion copies of his own rare book to determine the fakes.  Once  this can be determined this book collector wants to own the original at all  costs.  His stress on this extreme is clear, that he would expect Johnny  Depp to kill to obtain this book for him.  He won't take no for an answer,  from Johnny Depp either.<br />The attraction to this book, is that it is  proported to be co-authored by the devil himself and the possessor, would  if properly used gain supernatural (or in this case subnatural?)  powers.<br />The premise was wonderfully set up.  On top of that, the book  that Johnny Depp is entrusted with was apparently obtained in such a  fashion that the owner would kill to get it back.  Unfortunately, Johnny  Depp's character finds this out only at the death of his partner.  His  partner's death amazing resembles a tile in the book.<br />The promise of  this story, is never met, even though, it has many twisted insights: the  mysterious girl on the train, the tiles matching the various deaths that  follow, etc.  But, they are presented in a matter of fact way that there  is no build up of suspense or tension in any fashion.  At one point in  time when Lena Olin's character steals the book from Johnny Depp, Frank  Langella kills her to get it back.  There seems to be no sense or horror  to the killings.  Nor any retribution considered.  One small thing is the  European scenery is beautiful.<br />The main finding Johnny Depp's character  adds is that the books, are all partial fakes.  Each one has non-Lucifer  signed tiles and only by taking the real tiles from each of the books, is a  full set possible.  Of course this happens.  But, not completely.  Frank  Langella's character thinks he has and by taking them to a site (a really  neat abandoned castle in Europe, that's significance is never revealed)  ends up self immolating in a show of omnipotence.<br />Johnny Depp escapes  and his &quot;floating&quot; mystery girl tells him what went wrong and  nudges him to find the key to gain this power himself.  You end on the note  of Johnny Depp reentering the castle where Frank Langella toasted  himself.<br />This movie had so much potential that was wasted, the insight  that all 3 books needed to make up the sum of the single set of real tiles,  the mysterious deaths of the previous owners, etc.  However, there was no  sense of depth from the characters.<br />Johnny Depp's character was so  matter of fact about the deaths happening around him, you would think he  was a hard bitten Army captain rather than an antique book dealer.  His  entire sense of strain was portrayed in alcohol bottles and cigarettes.  Frank Langella's role, as usual was over the top power hungry maniac  wearing a bad set of glasses.<br />Lena Olin's character was a little more  involved, but not much more so, with her playing a not so grieving gold  digging widow, who's dead husband's last living act was to part with a book  that she cherished.<br />The floating mystery girl, according to other  reviewers was Roman Polanski's wife.  Gee, I wonder if her eyes really  change color like that, and what did that mean anyway?  Shades of Pia  Zadora?f the books, is a  full set possible.   Of course this happens.  But, not completely.

6305807086|5.0|As a concept, this movie floored me.  I think the concept of a marketable portal into someone's mind needs to be explored further.  As a student of self-reference (see Douglas Hofstadter's works for more info), I  belly-laughed at the concept of Malkovich entering his own portal.  The  result was fabulous.  A silly movie, but one I will watch repeatedly.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This album has been out for months, but I just bought it this weekend. I don't know why I avoided it for so long. Perhaps it was the fact that I was mildly disappointed in &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; after wearing my  &quot;Bloodsugarsexmagik&quot; tape out. <br />But after hearing cuts from  &quot;Californication&quot; such as 'Other Side', 'Scar Tissue', 'Around  The World' and 'Californication' on the radio, I broke down and bought it.  <br />And boy am I glad I did. This is among the best CDs that I have bought  in a year. Where I was disappointed with the latest from Everclear for its  weak song-writing, the RHCPs have put together a masterful album.<br />Anthony  Kiedis has never been better, showing a full range of vocals, solid song  writing in this mix of funk and mellow ballads.<br />The four previously  mentioned songs are solid, and I also really like 'Easily'.<br />The only song  that hasn't grown on me is 'I Like Dirt.' Maybe it's the title I can't get  past. I don't know. But the rest of the album is great.<br />After slipping  some on 'OHM', they have recaptured the magic that made 'BSSM' such a huge  smash.
B000005HBI|5.0|I came to this album with the perspective of a blues fan.  I'm an avid collector of old country blues recordings.  I was instantly converted, and I'm now a devoted Cassandra Wilson fan.  Nobody covers Robert Johnson and  Son House quite the way she does, she completely captured the original  haunting essence of Death Letter and Hellhound on my Trail without doing it  anywhere close to verbatim.  Very interesting and beautiful takes on  &quot;Tupelo Honey&quot; and Joni Mitchell's &quot;Black Crow&quot; as  well.
B00000JCRH|5.0|When I put my money down for this CD, I was a bit uneasy about it because I wasn't sure how much better it would be than the original &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; CD, which I already own.  The first thing I did was to listen  to &quot;Disposable Heroes&quot; on the original album, and then I listened  to the same song on the gold disc, and I must admit I was amazed at the  superior quality.  As I listened to the song I was impressed by how clear  on crisp the song sounded and how glad I was I decided to get the CD.  For  those of you who love the album and want to hear it in the outstanding  quality it was meant to be heard in, add this one to your shopping cart  immediately, you will not regret it.  If you are the type of person who  does not appreciate good sound you may not be able to tell the difference,  but a finely tuned Metallica ear will easily be able to tell this CD is  worth the buck.
B00004SCBG|5.0|This album, start to finish, is one of King Crimson's finest pieces of work.  The songs stand alone just fine as individual pieces, but the album is greater than than sum of its parts.  Highly recommended.
B000044U4B|5.0|I am going to keep this short and to the point.  &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; is an amazing album, but you haven't really heard it until you heard it on the gold disc.  The superior sound quality takes this  classic album, and let's you hear it the way it was meant to be heard,  clear and without defects.
0152023984|5.0|One of my favorite short books, this is more of a short story or a children's story than a real novel. All the same, it's so beautiful that sometimes I have difficulty reading it.<br />A man has crashed in the desert, and out of nowhere a little Prince appears. The Prince talks to him and  keeps him company, while also telling him of his travels. The Prince is  truly charming, a wise little boy who captures the heart immediately, and  his stories and observations have the otherworldly quality of a dream.<br />At  the same time, there is a sadness that permeates the book-somehow I felt  that it could not end happily, and that made this story all the more  precious.<br />This is a book that is shoved with the children's literature,  and I believe that it is often overlooked by adults who would benefit from  the simplicity of the Little Prince.
B00000ILDE|4.0|As with Director Cuts, the version we all saw in the movie theatres is not the intended director's vision.  Often the director, under pressure from the Studios, deletes scenes to  reducing the length of the film, to speed  up the action, to provide improved continuity, etc.   <br />Most of the time,  the cuts are smart moves (the Sixth Sense deleted scenes come to mind), but  in this case, (also in Cameron's T2 SE) these cuts did nothing to slow down  the plot.<br />Scenes include: Ripley in a hologarden, Meeting Newt's brother  and parents, the sentry guns in play and others.  Cameron tacks on an  additional 17 minutes (only in Dune and The Professional have more minutes  been added on..IMO)that provides additional texture (not plotline).<br />Also  there is a THX transfer that is magnificent and the anamorphic widescreen  is a treat to watch.  You know that you are watching a DVD,, rather than  VHS.<br />If you are looking for an sci-fi/action movie in the tradition of  Predator, Aliens is a superior choice....Rating B+
B000002HRE|3.0|I've been listening since the 'Ride The Lightning'. I don't think Load/Reload albums are bad albums by any means but I still wouldn't call them sell-outs either.  Sure, any band needs support of its fans, but it  shouldn't be the other way around of the band catering for the fans' needs.   When Load came out, I was just as disappointed as those who still moan  about it today, but unlike a few, I grew to understand what they're doing  at this period in their careers.  After their never-ending touring in  support of the the black album, they simply had nothing left to prove, they  were simply on top of the world.  They just needed to *try* something  different, not for the fans but for themselves.  If you just go around  trying to please people then that's a pretty sad existence. But then  they'll always be those who'll argue stupidly that &quot;bands like Pantera  (excellent band), Slayer (used to be good) etc are doing things for  themselves but they haven't sold out.&quot;  well maybe they are, maybe  they aren't but then not everybody wants to do exactly the same thing.   There is such a thing called CHOICE.<br />At the end of the day, Metallica  have the advantage since the music belongs to THEM and they can do what  they want with it.  Those who want Kill 'Em All for every album - start  your own band!  Those who still moan...  get a life!  It's just music...  noise even!  I hardly think it affects your life that much.
630503723X|4.0|Strange...I have the full 92 minute version (with French Subtitles) and it is made by Fox Lorber.  Anyway, that is the movie I will review...<br />Sylvia Kristel knows what female sexuality is.  She does not have a fantastic body  and her face looks typically Dutch, but she has this mystical look that  most women nowaday have no clue about (Catherine Deneuve has this same  look).  She plays the now experienced Emmanuelle (from the first movie),  who now has a new husband and lives in Hong Kong.  <br />There is little plot,  and the movie is based on a series of vignette sexual encounters, but the  European soundtrack and exotic locations are so sexual.  If there is a  movie to put anyone in the mood, without being obvious, this is it.  I feel  that it is better than the first one, which was very seventies, raunchy and  had artsy dialogue.  <br />The DVD is still pretty bare, but the transfer is  very good (absolutely neccessary for such a visual movie).  Sound is  average, but hell, I read much of the dialogue anyway (I absolutely love  the emmanuelle song).<br />So, you want to a little raunch in your collection,  skip Pamela Anderson and all those fake blondes and try this erotic gem  that will show you the true meaning of sexiness......Rating: B
0380002930|1.0|I don't believe this, some of the people here gave a bad review and then some of these fans insult that person and his/her opinions. the jerks! How dare you people to not respect other people's opinions. Besides, they have  a good point. this is pure fantasy. talking rabbits. and they're right, I  wouldn't want to read about what rabbits call their pooh, wether rabbits  really pooh or not, I don't care, that doesn't mean I want to read about  it, and I also don't want to read about how rabbits copulate. There are  plenty of books about talking humans that aren't pure fantasy. why don't  you read those?
B00004TWZG|5.0|I admit, I am a Professional junkie.  I got a copy of the bootleg VHS tape from a Japanese Laser and have worn it out.  Not only was the US version good, the &quot;version Integrale&quot; Full Version of the movie is even  better.  The movie was cut to appease the MPAA not because it is brutal, or  because it showed blood, because it showed Natalie Portman:<br />1. Drinking  Champaign<br />2. Going on hits (she does not kill anyone)<br />3. Foolishly  trying to seduce Leon.<br />4. Sleeping in the same bed with Leon (fully  clothed).<br />Silliness aside, this is a SERIOUS movie.  About a  &quot;cleaner&quot; played by Jean Reno (from a character concept taken  from &quot;La Femme Nikita) who is in bondage from a local mob guy.  He  goes on all the dangerous hits and this has detached Leon from normal  society.  He also has the guilt of his ex-girlfriend on his shoulders.  The  introduction of Mathilda to his life uproots and disturbs him.  However, it  also forces Leon to become human again.  It is facinating to see him regain  his humanity.<br />When the DEA kills the family next door, Mathilda is  rescued by Leon and becomes partners.  Natalie Portman makes her screen  debut and it is a powerhouse.  She takes a real risk playing the street  tough Mathilda because she is a bad@ss, yet on the verge of becoming a  sexual woman.  Many youths would have screwed up this role majorly, but  Portman handles it like a 10 year veteran (she was only 12-13 when doing  this movie, reminding me of another youth who took a risk in a movie when  she was that age...Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver).  Gary Oldman is the over  the top DEA Agent, Stansfield.  He takes this role with real  relish.<br />While this movie looks and feels French, that is not a problem.   It is a cool movie, and the relationship between the detached simpleton  Leon and Mathilda is magnetic.  I felt real sorry when Leon lets Mathilda  go to save her life at the end of the movie.  I recommend this movie to  action movie lovers and even those who have to watch movies with this  person...Rating A-
B000023X9W|4.0|ALERT!  DIE HARD NEIL YOUNG FAN HERE!  COULD BE BIAS UPON THIS REVIEW!<br />Definately a great album if you enjoyed his past albums such as &quot;Harvest,&quot; &quot;Harvest Moon,&quot; and &quot;Unplugged.&quot;   It's not Neil when he performs with Crazy Horse, nor is it when he's with  Pearl Jam.  But there's definately the great Neil Young songwriting spirit  alive here.<br />To go even more biased here, I recieved the CD the day before  my grandfather passed away, so now all of the sudden &quot;Good to See  You&quot; becomes the song that I associate with my grandfather.  Then  again I'm sure all of you will find someone to associate this song with,  whether or not it's someone you lost recently or someone you just see once  in a while.<br />Down to the final song where he sings the lyric &quot;my  software's just not compatible anymore&quot; still gives you that NY sense  of humor that we've grown to love over the years.
B000002JS6|5.0|If you haven't bought this record yet, then obviously you are new to rock. AC/DC's power chords have become their trademark, and with a large following in virtually every continent the band is one of the most  recognized hard rock band throughout the entire world. 'Back in Black' is  the album that brought about the peak of the aussie band.<br />Largely known  for its classical tracks 'Hells Bells', 'You Shook Me All Night Long' and  the title track, this record's other 7 songs are a great listen as well,  thanks to the great song-writing of the Young brothers. Making his debut on  this record as the new vocalist for AC/DC is Brian Johnson, whose voice is  now one of the most recognizable voices in rock. Angus Young's  simple-but-awesome combinations of just a couple of power chords rock the  speakers, and the the true rock lyrics that talk about sex, alcohol and  rock 'n roll make the songs complete.<br />'Back in Black' has sold well over  16 million copies in the U.S. alone, and stands as one of the best rock  albums of all time. This album is a great introduction to hard rock, as it  is the best record of one of the best rock bands of all time.
B000001ESJ|5.0|i was a huge rush fan after i heard &quot;all the world's a stage&quot; so when this album came out i listened and fell in love with it right away. i saw them on this tour also and i still can't find words to describe how  good it was. every song on &quot;farewell to kings&quot; is a masterpeice  and to me &quot;closer to the heart&quot; is one of the best songs ever  written!
B000001FY9|5.0|I had been a loyal fan of Bob Marley for years when &quot;Legend&quot; first came out. I honestly did not think that anything could be better, but I was definitely blown away by this CD. The soulfull and incredibly  beautiful live version of &quot;No woman no cry&quot; is sure to hit a soft  spot with all fans. It is the best Marley collection to date, and I am glad  to see how this CD is helping to introduce newer generations to the  wonderful legacy of Marley's music. He definitely left us too soon...his  music is for the ages.

B000005J56|5.0|A Great Cd, I like Cuban music. But I must say, I do not like other people picking on real reviewers. It is  not the Hispanic way. Amigo, your ignorance is showing. Here in Texas we would brand you an ingrate. But back  to the music. Passion abounds and we in Texas love passion and everything  BIG. This CD is big on musicians from Cuba and NY who show thier passions  with their words and movements. A great buy.

0062502182|5.0|No matter where you are in the journey of life, you instinctually know where you stand, not in relation to others, or in physical space, but in reference to following and achieving your dreams.  All to often dreams and  their pursuit is repressed, as security and predictability are clung to.   <br />The Alchemist is an elegant tale of a boy who forgoes the safety and  security of remaining in the village in which he was born and raised.  With  the blessing of his parents, he decides to purchase a flock of sheep and  see the country.  Life as a shepherd is rewarding, for a time.  It's  predictable, and fulfilling, yet a recurring dream leads the boy to believe  there is more to life, than remaining a shepherd.  After consulting with a  gypsy and a king, the boy decides to sell his flock, and embark on a  journey to find treasure in the Egyptian pyramids (his dream).  The ensuing  journey forces the boy to dig deep within himself, to trust his intuition,  make the most of some less than ideal circumstances, and most of all the  believe in himself.  Numerous people, and encounters, including war, and  the woman of his dreams, build his character, and ability to trust his  intuition throughout the journey.  The treasure he reaps is the reward of  trusting himself, pursuing his dreams, and having no regrets throughout the  journey of life.<br />The Alchemist touches on issues faced by many people.   It is a story about following a dream, and living w/o regrets.  It's about  having the courage to step into uncharted territory, outside the safety of  the familiar, and embark on a rewarding journey.  If you are holding back  in life, feeling that you are capable of much more than your present  reality, pick up a copy of this book, and give it a few hours (which is all  it'll take you to read it).  It'll make you think, make you dream, and just  maybe give you the courage trust yourself, follow your intuition, and  realize those dreams you know you are capable of achieving.

0671034065|4.0|I almost didn't buy this book because I was so disappointed in Ms. Howards last book, All The Queen's Men, but I am very glad I did!  The romantic and sexual tension is back in Mr. Perfect and the interactions between the hero  and heroine are great.  I kept reading much later than I should of just  because I wanted to see what would happen between the two of then next.  I  finished the book in one sitting, which is something I haven't done in a  very long time.   Jaine is probably the best heroine of all of Ms. Howard's  books so far, and I loved all of the secondary characters as well.  Both  Jaine and Sam, the hero and heroine, have their flaws, but that is what  made me like them so much.  The mystery was way too easy to solve, but for  me that's not really the point of reading the book anyway, but rather to  see the relationship develop between the hero and heroine.  It did not  disappoint!   My one real problem with the book is picky and has nothing to  do with plot or characters, etc.   But in the discussion about birth  control in the book, it was never mentioned that you should wait until you  have been on the pill for a month for it to be effective as birth control.   Sam and Jaine made a big oops with that one.  Like I said picky.  But I  would hate for someone who doesn't know this to read it and think it would  be o.k. to be intimate with someone that soon after going on the pill and  being &quot;safe.&quot;
0060977493|2.0|I took my time to read this book, for I wanted to relish it in totality. But frankly it did leave me a bit disappointed and wanting some explanations. As a story there is really not much.More of an autobiography  of Ms Roy. So then if one is not looking for a touching gut wrenching story  then the language and imagery should leave you touched. Here too I could  only get mixed feelings. At times it was good and honest. At others just  confusing and plain boring. It seems that the author has strung together  disjointed passages from her life. Each chapter starts well then ends up in  a web of confusion. The vision and world view of a child does come through.  BUT...so does confusion!  Maybe that is what publishers wanted. Yes this is  different no doubt,yet one cannot call it emotional or touching. So I can  at best only give it two stars. One can read one book of this type,however  to read more will be indeed sheer drudgery. There is no real happiness in  the lives of any of the characters. And no joy conveyed thru the writings.  So in all this is just above average.
630522885X|5.0|Some reviewers on this site have blasted this transfer for low video and sound quality.  Frankly, this caused me to hesitate several months before plunking down the cash to see this.  Since the art house revival scene is  dying out and you would never find this in the local Ballbuster, I realized  that this was the only chance I had to see this movie--by reputation an  overlooked classic.<br />I hit the play button last night with a certain  trepidation, mentally preparing myself to view a badly worn relic.   Fortunately, the &quot;low technical quality&quot; rumors are much  overblown.  Yes, this is a 45 year old color film that did not see loving  restoration in its DVD transfer.  Nonetheless, color, resolution and sound  rate a B or B+, but you would have to be a churlish obsessive to complain  about it.  The miracle is that you can get this film at all in eminently  watchable condition.<br />I suppose Oedipal elder abuse was a good publicity  strategy for establishing street cred for the new wave, but Lola Montes  provides convincing evidence that the French movie landscape of the early  50's has been unfairly denigrated as a musty dead end.  Lola Montes is a  high energy, exuberantly theatrical, cinematic tour de force on the same  exalted level as Rules of the Game or Children of Paradise that testifies  that the old wave went out in a blaze of glory, not sclerosis.
0783117388|5.0|I received the box set from my brother for my birthday.  When I removed the gift wrap my first reaction was why on earth would he give me these!   When I finally sat down and watched the first tape, all I could think was  that I was so glad there were two more tapes to watch!  I believe that this  is the funniest, most realistic, well written and just downright  entertaining show to come out in a long time.  I'm hooked!  I can't wait  for the second season to come out on tape - in fact, I've already hinted to  my brother that he can give me that for my next birthday!
B00004RHZU|5.0|This CD is the best new release I've heard in ages! She isn't trying to sound like an already established female artist. She sounds like herself and it sounds wonderful. She has a very powerful voice and an equally as  powerful message. I personally am a little exhausted from all the dreamy  love ballads on the radio, Pink states reality...we need a lot of that.  They are not playing her nearly as much as they should here in Columbus,  Ohio but hopefully that should change. With a voice like that, Pink is not  opening up for the right groups, as a matter of fact, she shouldn't be the  opening act for anyone, she needs to tour alone...that's just how good this  girl is.
6305897786|3.0|I found this movie very gripping. I found many of the concepts facinating. Many of the characters are captivating and very well thought out. Every character has hidden agendas and mystery. However for all the movies  greatness it fails at the end. Nothing is explained and there are not  enough clues for the audience to make their own minds about it. Almost  seemed that they got to the end and didn't know what to do. A brillant  movie that is let down at the end.
0788811355|5.0|I saw this file in a Second run theater that smelled like the sewer overflowed and flooded the place.  But it didn't matter because the movie was so excellent that I didn't even know I was there.  <br />I can't even  figure out what it was that I loved so much about the movie.  I expected it  to be some stupid romance chic flick.  But at the end of the movie I just  couldn't get over the feeling that it had touched on a part of my soul that  I rarely get to see.  It's a long movie and if I had my way, all movies  would be 3 to 4 hours.  There are times in the movie that are a bit slow,  and there's not really any major action in it.  There is some history  (though I don't know how accurate it is)  Mostly it just the feeling I got  that endeared me so much to this movie.  It's so charged with emotion  throughout.  The feeling of loss and acceptance becomes your own when you  really put yourself there.  I think that's what makes this movie great- the  ability to be there riding in that plane as it crashes, walking across the  desert with the knowledge that everything you care about is depending on  you.  <br />It's a beautiful story and though I don't usually care a bit about  awards, I would give this one my award for superb execution of a story that  tore at my heart and pulled tears out of my cold and controled exterior.
B00000J2KX|5.0|First of all, i must state quite simply; this is probably the greatest most epic horror movie EVER. I have never been more scared during a movie then I was during this. Sorry, but halloween, Jason, Freddy, and all their  clones just dont frighten me. This is TRUE horror, suspense at it's  greatest. It is IMHO Nicholson's greatest performance, he is PERFECT. And  the set design is UNBELIEVABLE!  Ok, now for all you people who think  this movie doesn't compare to the book or whatever, first off the bat, the  book hardly scared me, if anything i thought King's book was cheesy. This  movie frightened me and put me in a state of awe that the book couldn't  touch. OK, this movie was not supposed to be exactly like the book. If it  was, King would have written the screenplay. He didn't, Kubrick wrote the  screenplay. They are very different in their morals and in their beliefs of  human nature. This movie is more realistic then the book. And yes, even at  the beginning of the movie Jack is supposed to have that glimmer of  insanity, he is an unstable person recovering from alcoholism. BUT he is  still a good father and husband.There are so many themes I could touch on,  but I won't even bother. Just know that this is a completely different  entity then King's 'masterpiece', as all you people call it (haha).It is  much superior. Kubrick truely is a genius.....
B00004T9UF|4.0|it all started out as The Real Slim Shady being the song that i bought the album for then i realized some awesome songs on it like Stan, Kim, and criminal and now im hooked and cant stop listening. True that Eminem is not  the most talented person on earth and his music even though it is mostly  negative cooments just makes me so happy inside just screaming out the  songs in the car or whatever getting all that anger out. It feels great and  the CD is a great one and anyone that loves to scream their lungs out  around the house or in the car.you will love this one I SWEAR. :)
B000000WF0|5.0|I bought the tape on whim while shopping for my mom's birthday because I loved &quot;Bittersweet Symphony.&quot;  I listened to the album, but I didn't really pay attention to what it was trying to tell me.  Then, a few  months later, I was a dark period in my life where I felt that no one else  could understand me. To put it in the simplest of terms, my heart was  broken. I was really bored one day, drowning in my own misery, and I  decided to put in Urban Hymns just to have something to listen to.  By  chance, &quot;One Day&quot; was the song that started. And I can remember  clearly how good it felt to have someone sing &quot;one day maybe you will  love again - love that never dies&quot; I listened to the entire tape that  day like I never ever listened to it before. I wanted to slap myself in the  face for not realizing what was just gathering dust on my desk, would  actually turn out to change the way I look at life.  It was as if Richard  Ashcroft knew exactly how I felt about things in life, like he sat in my  head and just picked those thoughts out.  It is the soundtrack of my life,  and I recommend it to anyone who is curious about The Verve, or those who  have been long time fans.  I'll admit that I think &quot;History&quot; is  the greatest song they've ever done, but with this album, I love every  song, and that is rare for me.  I still sometimes cry whenever I hear  &quot;One Day.&quot;  This album has songs that one can totally jam to, and  songs that can bring you to tears five minutes later.  My absolute  favourite on the album though is &quot;Weeping Willow.&quot;  I don't  exactly know why, but &quot;the pills under my pillow, weeping willow, the  gun under your pillow&quot; part totally gets to me.   This album is  beautiful, and if I were stranded on a desert island with only a radio and  one cd this would be the one I would bring.  I finally had the cd given to  me as a gift because I literally wore out the tape.  But anyway, buy this  album, you won't regret it, and check out some of The Verve's other stuff.   Plus, Richard Ashcroft's solo album is very good also.  Not quiet  &quot;vervy&quot; but I am in love with it. If I could give it more than 5  stars, believe me I would.
B000000W5L|5.0|&quot;Exile on Main Street&quot; is one of the very few timeless masterpieces in the history of Rock music. It is an album that is as relevant in our youth as in our old age, but for many different reasons  that only the &quot;friendly experiencer&quot; can discern.  <br />&quot;Exile&quot; is unique among Stones albums because Keef's vocals  can be heard along with Mick's on many of the tracks, creating a sense of  community that permeates the album. The styles of music represented are  widespread (e.g., country, rock, ballads, etc.), which gives the album a  dynamic texture. In addition, it features Mick Taylor, whom along with  &quot;early&quot; Clapton (not the Babyface/Elton John/Billy Joel-style  adult contemporary Clapton of modern times) I consider to be the finest  non-Hendrix guitar player in rock history. Finally, there is desperation,  inspiration,and exaltation in Keef's playing on this album. His riffs  during the chorus of &quot;Soul Survivor&quot; are transcendent--so strong  and so well-placed amidst the triumph and tragedy of the music.  &quot;Exile&quot; is like taking a trip down the dirty boulevard, with its  bizarre cast of characters embodying the truths and lies, pains and  pleasures, and faiths and disillusionments that marked the post-60s  intellectual and spiritual climate.
0788821075|5.0|A brillant, feel good, romantic comedy, featuring Richard Gere as a very handsome &amp; rich successful  businessman. Julia Roberts plays the prostitute he picks up &amp; he makes her an offer that she can`t resist,  which entails her being his plaything and  he also wants her to partner him  when he has business functions, &amp; in return he offers to pay her a vast  amount of money to stay with him for the week. she ends up staying longer  then that as they fall in love. The film has a magical, cinderella style  ending. The sound track includes, of course the title of the film  &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; &amp; &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;  Its   wonderfully lighthearted with lots of humour &amp; great chemistry between  the 2 stars. Its sheer ecapism.
0688170528|5.0|As a high school teacher, I thought this book might be interesting.  Instead of just a teenagers' novel, I found a book I couldn't put down!  The characters are believable, the story line riveting, and the ending a  shock.  As an adult, you will be reminded of your childhood and teenage  years.  As a teenager, you can get a feeling of what it might be like to be  the living member of a suicide pact.  A must read for teenagers, teachers,  and parents of teenagers
B000001FA4|5.0|I can't believe all the Elvis Presley and America bashing that goes on here.  EPA is the emotional highpoint of the album for me and one of my favorite U2 songs, period.  Certainly it's a difficult track.. but I like  it. =/
B000006CCG|5.0|My First and definetly not last WASP cd.  It ruled and I encourage anyone who likes metal to buy this they will not be disapointed I promise!
0684833395|5.0|This book is more about people than it is about war.  It is more about life than it is about death.  It is more about Yossarian and Nately (and his old man) and Sheisskopf and Major Major than it is about World War II.   Hell, I even took my username from my favorite character in this book (as  well as literature universall), Milo Minderbinder.<br />I have heard from many  that Heller has not approached this brilliance since.  He once, when asked  why he had not written another novel as good as Catch-22, said, &quot;Well,  nobody else has either.&quot;  That just might be true.  This book made me  look at people with all their quirks and their inconsistencies and try to  laugh instead of argue.  It helped me look at our world with a smile and a  laugh insead of a frown and a spoonful of critisism.  Parts were hilarious,  parts were poignant.<br />Its story is far less important than its character  (as made evident by the format).  In every character you see something in  yourself.  In Yossarian I saw much of what I would like to have the guts to  do.  I saw common sense.  It was also a manifestation of Orwell's famous  quotations, &quot;Sanity is Not Statistical.&quot;  <br />Read this book:  laugh, cry, think, be enlightened.<br />{{{milo}}}
B000009RC2|5.0|Synergy is where the result is greater than the sum of its parts. Here I believe is the beginnings of a great musical synergy. I still find this music challenging, running a the whole range of emmotions. They way the  guitar searches upwards and outwards, from a scream to a whisper, The  record that turned me on to the violin in modern music. Although I feel  Jerry Goodman played more difficult violin passages with the flock, here it  is just right. Cobham's drums I marvel at, to keep the grove, and with such  intricate patterns. Rick Lairds bass lines are not always the most  obviously spectacular, but they give a great foundation to this great  music. An emmotional roller coaster, always yearning for something beyond.  Many may not like this recording, but it is still revolutionary, and still  great.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I consider myself fairly versed in the world of music.  I own every Beatles CD, have every Zeppelin song on CD, love the Velvet Undergroudnd, Mahavishnu Orchestra, The Clash, etc.  This CD puts them all to shame.   This CD changed my perception of music.<br />This CD literally showed me how  brilliant and how emotional could be.  My favorite album used to be  Sergeant Pepper, but that pales in comparison to this.  This was literally  a revelation.<br />When you buy this CD (and you must), turn off all the  lights and listen to it over and over again, savoring every texture, every  change in melody, every one of Thom's passionate moanings.  You will be  captured.  When people ask me what my favorite song is, I say OK COMPUTER.   The album flows so well and carries its themes so coherently (despite being  very diverse) that it seems like a song itself.  Taken together, songs one  and two and songs four and five are just sublime.  Paranoid Android is  breathtaking.<br />I love the Bends as well, but that is not as consistently  brilliant.  For those Radiohead lovers out there (I know we are a  passionate bunch) I recommend Neutral Milk Hotel, Built to Spill, DJ  Shadow, The Velvet Underground, Godspeed You Black Emperor, Sonic Youth,  etc.<br />IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO BUY IT.  YOU  WILL NOT SURVIVE UNCHANGED.<br />{{{milo}}}
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the true masterpieces, of modern special effects.  Want proof?  Check out the Neo vs. Morphious fight scene, it's amazing!  My next question is for the people responsible for American Beauty being named the  Oscar for best movie, how could you?  That movie, pales in comparison to  this classic.  That's about it, so now press order now, and get a copy of  this fabulous movie!
B00000DHZJ|4.0|Jimi Hendrix is the greatest guitarest of all time.  In every way.<br />The music on this CD is all amazing and his virtuosity is evident from the first track.  I'm particularly partial to &quot;Voodoo Child&quot; and  &quot;Little Wing,&quot; but then, what am I saying, they're all fantastic.   In fact &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; might be the best of them  all.  Jimi played guitar as if it were the song instead of separate from  the song to show off as many noted guitarists did.  He became the song.   <br />The reason I gave this only four stars?  You are doing yourself a  horrible disservice if you don't listen to Jimi live.  It is spellbinding.   I (naively) considered Paige the best guitarist before I heard Jimi on the  Woodstock CD.  Him being himself and playing from the soul is incredible.   Each note is so spontaneous and so powerful.  <br />Buy this album, but also  buy a live one.  Both are essential to understand the genius of  Hendrix.<br />{{{milo}}}
B00002Z88D|1.0|S&amp;M will buy Lar$ and co. another private jet and a few gold-plated toilets for their castles I'm sure, as ANYTHING released by Metallica will be healthily lapped up by their legions of blindly devoted sheep. Metallica  isnt doing anything original here, literally hundreds of rock 'n' roll  bands have done this before, and sadly (and expectedly) Metallica  contribute absolutely nothing to this form of expression. I would even  venture to say Metallicas hideous effort only debased the whole concept of  a rock band performing simultaneously alongside an orchestra. The San  Francisco Symphony itself sounds completely independent of the arrangements  Metallica play, and likewise. This results in extreme annoyance, for old  classics like Master of Puppets and Battery are butchered unmercifully at  the hands of the musics noisy and unfocused nature. It will literally make  you cringe, and possibly send you into violent convulsions of repugnance.  Jame$ desperately tries to sing like a professional vocalist, but doesnt  have a voice, so that is another major detraction. He should go back to  growling. Kirk carelessly committs several atrocious guitar mistakes,  notably in the solo of &quot;One.&quot; Lazy Lar$ plays like a dehumanized  drum machine as always, without an ounce of soul or interest. As a  functionable unit, Metallica fails miserably. The symphony plays fine, but  ultimately the obscure compositional accompaniment and Metallicas  lackluster exertion prove detrimental to this pitiful excuse for an album.  How long can this band rape the corpse of their past legacy?
B000001FS3|5.0|If I were to be stranded on a desert island with my discman and only one cd, this would be the one I'd choose.  I first heard this album when I was seven, too young to understand U2's politics and too young to be aware of  how quickly this album rocketed them to superstardom.  Ever since that  time, they have remained my favorite band.  The emotion of 'One Tree Hill',  'Exit', 'With or Without You', 'Mothers of the Disappeared'... Okay, the  whole album is touching and raw and beautiful.  And if you understand the  politics behind them, they are that much more significant.   There may have  been a U2 backlash in the years following this album's release, but no one  can deny the artistic merit of 'The Joshua Tree.'  There are great rock  anthems on this album, which, together with the softer songs form an  interesting landscape.  The songwriting is impeccable, and the music  remains unparalleled.  The only other album that I would consider as  competition for this one would be 'Actung Baby'; the darker side of U2's  sonic imaging...
067144901X|5.0|I bought this book for my 4-month old son, because I think that this is the stuff he can relate to, rather than books with more words. The fact that I am a fan of Sandra Boynton's greeting cards did not prepare me for the sheer delight of this book. It's genius! The baby responds to the easily recognizable sounds, the background colors of the pages, and who knows what else: he starts wriggling in anticipation as soon as i put the book in front of him. For grownups, this book sounds like Dada poetry, it's like an inside joke, and you can't stop laughing at it.  Once I went back to work, I would call home and recite parts of it, and he would laugh and call \\"Mama!\\"  I'm going to recommend it to everyone I know who has kids. It's a delight!
B000002KHB|5.0|&quot;Machine Head&quot; is Deep Purple's one true masterpiece of an album, and not just because it contains the band's best known song, &quot;Smoke on the Water.&quot;  This album, along with &quot;The James  Gang Rides Again&quot; and &quot;Fire and Water&quot; by Free are the best  hard rock albums available circa 1970-71.  The Purple has never sounded  better or more original than they do on this album.  The songwriting is  first rate, and in addition to &quot;Smoke,&quot; the album contains the  Purple classics &quot;Highway Star,&quot; &quot;Lazy&quot; and &quot;Space  Truckin'.&quot;  Because of its consistency, I would buy it instead of any  of the Deep Purple anthology albums available.  This album is a must have  for fans of 70's rock.
0767804503|4.0|Camelot has captured the romantic attentions of many arduous fans throughout the years. And who could resist Julia Ormand, Richard Gere, and Sean Connery as a cast of bright stars revealing a modernized version of  King Arthur?<br />One of my favorite scenes in this rich and textural film is  when Richard Gere (Lancelot) quenches Julia Ormands (Lady Guinevere)thirst  by sensually contriving a waterfall of vibrant green leaves dripping onto  each lower leaf and falling deep into her parched throat.<br />You may think  you have read and seen enough about Camelot. Trust me, in this version, we  learn more about Lancelots background, his inner demons and pleasures.  <br />Just a glorious adventurous romantic film.<br />Thanks for your interest  &amp; comments--CDS
B00000163G|5.0|Tupac Shakur is my best rapper,musician etc.His album &quot;All eyez on me&quot;was the first I heard.all eyez on me is tha only double cd with no intro or interlude.it gives you about 27 tracks of quality lyrics by just  one man.compare it to life after death which is just a party album with no  true sense.this cd should be used to rate other hip hop albums as a tribute  to this genius(2pac).
B000002I27|4.0|I paid little attention to the Doors in 1967. Jim Morrison, with his skin-tight leather pants, white silk shirt open to the waist, and pretentious \\"ain't I such a stud\\" theatrics may have titillated 15-year old  girls; but it did nothing for me. It wasn't until about a decade later that  I looked back, and found Strange Days unrivaled and compelling. Instead of  focusing the sound of Strange Days on the guitar, the electric organ is the  centerpiece. Ray Manzarek plays both lead and bass organ like a rollicking  circus musician (When The Music's Over). Manzarek's work (almost)  overpowers Robby Krieger's guitar. I say \\"almost\\" because Krieger's style  is brilliant yet modest: he delivers these exquisite chords answering  Manzarek's every line. Note the tasteful keyboard/slide-guitar on  `Moonlight Drive.' Krieger is also in fine form with bending strings (Love  Me Two Times), and the haunting bass line of `You're Lost Little Girl.\\" And  John Densmore's drumming is far from \\"generic\\" (catch the drum rolls on  `When The Music's Over). Despite their superb musical talent, the band is  hardly noticeable, and easily overlooked.<br />Jim Morrison, with his booming  voice and stage swagger, is in command. The band reinforces Morrison's  every utterance. Morrison is an invincible seducer, and the band adds drama  to his lyrical adultery. Strange Days is dark, moody and (as advertised)  strange. A line from the opening track (Strange Days) sets the tone: \\"Hear  me talk of sin/And you know this is it.\\" Couples follow Romeo and Juliet's  example (Moonlight Drive), horses are drowned (Horse Latitudes) and little  girls blossom into mature women (You're Lost Little Girl). Strange Days  ends with the 11-minute epic `When The Music's Over': Morrison's passionate  warnings are loud enough to be heard in China.<br />Technical Note: \\"Digitally  Remastered\\" is often a marketing ploy, and \\"remaster\\" doesn't necessarily  mean \\"better.\\" The overall sound quality of my 1985 Electra \\"remaster\\" is  good. Emphasizing the high-end (percussion) results in added tape hiss, but  the level is acceptable. I'd rather have the \\"hiss\\" than DBX \\"pumping.\\" The  bass guitar notes are solid, and Morrison's voice is clear and distinct.
0782008372|1.0|This is the worst transfer I've ever seen on DVD.  It is a shame that such a great film, and has been ruined.
B000002L80|4.0|To date (1985), Little Creatures is Talking Heads worst Post-Punk/New Wave album, and their best Pop album. I guess they decided to stop speaking in tongues, and start speaking in, gosh, \\"melody.\\" For the first time, I can  actually sing along to songs like `Little Creatures' and `Road To Nowhere.'  The material is catchy (Television Man), bouncing (Perfect World), and  funny (Stay Up Late). Surprisingly, the vocal choruses are \\"pretty\\" (And  She Was, Creatures Of Love). The old \\"ever present\\" driving bass guitar  rhythms are still here, and unless David Byrne hired a ringer, Tina  Weymouth has never sounded more innovative (Give Me Back My Name, The Lady  Doesn't Mind). `Give Me Back My Name' and `The Lady Don't Mind' are weird  and spooky enough to remind me that I'm still listening to the Talking  Heads, and not Hanson. And isn't the concept of `Little Creatures' (no, not  spiders, but \\"kids\\") bizarre? The album answers the terrifying question,  \\"What would happen if I let David Byrne babysit my 3-year old?\\"  The answer  - \\"I wanna make him stay up all night\\" (Stay Up Late). Talking Heads  followers might say that the avant garde of riffs and grooves have \\"sold  out.\\" Bologna - what could be more subversive than playing with rug rats?
B00003CX59|2.0|One has to wonder just how Tim Burton sees the world around him.  If his movies are any indication, it is a dark and gloomy vision.  His movies always reflect this and Sleepy Hollow is no exception. This film consists  of a clumsy story thrown together from the remnants of a demolished  Washington Irving classic.  Assuming you can see though its typically  Burton-esque fog of gloom, you will find some good actors struggling  within.  The script is sophomoric and the direction directionless.  Johnny  Depp's Ichabod Crane, despite the actor's considerable talent, is reduced  to Burton's version of an inept Sherlock Holmes.  He is even forced to don  more Burton hardware, making the transition from &quot;Edward Scissor  Hands&quot; to &quot;Bobby Binocular Eyes&quot;.  Out of the darkness rides  &quot;The Headless Horseman&quot; (head played by Christoper Walken) upon a  vaporous explanation that is a cross between Dracula and the Witches of  Eastwick.  It is always unfortunate when Hollywood distorts classic  literature, but Tim Burton seems to have raised this vandalism to an art  form.  What will be next?  Tim Burton's The Yearling?  If so, they better  get the fog machines started and dark fabric on order now.  Oh, and don't  for get the black deer.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is a great cd! I have all five Green Day cd's and this is buy far the best. I love every single song on hear! You MUST buy this album, you have know idea what your missing out on!
6304913176|4.0|Starship Troopers isn't your typical action film. Sure, it looks the same as all the other action/sci-fi movies out there, but to tell you the truth, it really isn't. Starship Troopers is more then just an action film.  Comedy, love, (sort of) and a bit of drama make this not your typical shoot  em' up sci-fi/action film like Predator or Aliens. <br />Starship Troopers has  A LOT of action. If you like action movies, you can't go wrong with  Starship Troopers. The thing is, even if you don't like action films that  much, this still has a lot of different genres mixed in. Its humorous,  dramatic, and... I hate to say romantic, but in a way it is a little. The  special effects are the best yet. The space ships and the arachnids look  great.<br />The bad thigs are that there is a lot of graphic violence and  gore. Another bad thing is the sex/nudity. There is a lot in the film, and  some of it is not even relevant to the film. (The shower scene.)  <br />Overall, this is a four-star movie. It's a great action/sci-fi film, but  is flawed by heavy violence/gore and irrelevant sex/nudity. Worth watching  at least three times.
630521610X|5.0|Unfortunetly I saw Scream 2 before I saw Scream, so I knew who the killer/killers was/were. Even so I was still surprised by seeing who was the next to drop. The Movie starts out with Drew Barrymore making popcorn  and the phone rings and it's a person out to try to kill her. He has her  boyfriend outside tied up and asks her trivia questions about scary movies.  I don't want to give away the end of that though. The next day at school  the cops and reporters (one of which is Cortney Cox, later name is Cortney  Cox Archect) are all around because of the incident the night before.  Through the movie Cidney Prescout(Neve Cambell) is being terrorized by a  killer. She starts to suspect her boyfriend Billy Lumous. Her friend Randy  explanes the rules to survive a horror movie. Later at a party the tention  builds up some much until the movie ends. So watch this movie; it's the  begining of a great Triligy.

B00004T9UF|5.0|...  i love this boy, hes holdin it down hard core for the midwest and im in love w/ this album. the slim shady lp was tight and the marshall mathers lp is even better, my favorite song  has to be who knew or kim. he has a great way of releasing his frustrations  through his music and i respect him for that. vanilla ice gave white  rappers a bad name, but em came and cleared that up fast. i listen to all  kinds of music, from nsync to eminem to metallica and everything in  between...well...everything but britney spears cuz shes a whore...but thats  beside the point, eminem really got me into the whole hip hop thing and i  really like it, and i really like eminems syle.ay, just buy the  CD and you can't go wrong. But beware, the return of Ken Kaniff is pretty  sick but still hilarious.ngsta rap production.  How does it stack up to Em's  debut?  At points, The Marshall Mathers LP surpasses Slim Shady, most  notably on the aforementioned &quot;Kill You&quot; and the virtuosic  &quot;Stan&quot;.  Unfortunately, towards the end it begins to feature  other less talented rappers and the tone shifts to brainless profanity and  straightforward violence.  It's too bad the the freshness of the first few  tracks couldn't be extended for the entire album (Perhaps due to the 70+  minute running time).  Still, I liked more than I didn't and I think that  some critics are being a bit too harsh.  The most important thing is that  even if eminem's lyrics slack off a bit, he's got amazing vocal talent.   While clearly no &quot;Slim Shady&quot; this one's still a worthy purchase.
0805062971|5.0|This is an excellent book that reads at a very fast pace. The lines are crisp, acute, slick and to the point of RIGHT NOW! This book explores the perils of man at the end of the twentieth century, what makes him tick, or  not, and why or why not. It is Orwell-esque in a political manner and  Hemingway-esque in the field of the thoughts of worth of life.

B00003Q438|3.0|First off I love this movie, and this DVD set is excellent.  This is not the reason for the 3 star rating, this is more of a rating of the DVD itself, and not the content.  I purchased this DVD thinking it was an  anamorphic transfer (enhanced for 16x9 or widescreen TVs).  IT IS NOT!  I  repeat, it is NOT an anamorphic transfer.  If you are a serious DVD  collector this should get your dander up.  And those people who are  casually collecting...as soon as you buy a TV that has 16x9 mode, this disc  will not look any better.  I am angry that the studio and Cameron allowed  this to happen.  Especially Cameron that is so touchy about the  &quot;craft&quot; of making movies.  He should be throwing a fit that this  DVD is non-anamorphic like I was when I put it in my player!  Now the  studio is gonna put out yet ANOTHER version that will be enhanced for  widescreen TVs, and I'm tired of playing that game.

B000002KIC|5.0|This quote from the Band is featured in the liner notes, who would give up touring after this sendoff (except for occasional reunions).  The Band plays some of their biggest hits here- like &quot;The Night They Drove Old  Dixie Down&quot; (as sung by Levon Helm), the jaunty &quot;Up On Cripple  Creek&quot; (which opens this set), the passionate &quot;Stage Fright&quot;  (as sung by the late Rick Danko), the soulful &quot;The Shape I'm In&quot;  (as sung by the late Richard Manuel), and &quot;The Weight&quot; (which has  been featured in TV commercials and films like &quot;Easy Rider&quot; and  &quot;The Big Chill&quot;).  They are joined by Bob Dylan (&quot;I Shall Be  Released&quot; and &quot;Forever Young&quot;), Joni Mitchell  (&quot;Coyote&quot;), Eric Clapton (it's a treat to hear him play  &quot;Further On Up The Road&quot;), Neil Young (&quot;Helpless&quot;),  Neil Diamond, Van Morrison (who sings an impressive rendition of  &quot;Caravan&quot;), Ringo Starr, Paul Butterfield, and Muddy Waters  (whose classic &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;, incidentally, almost didn't make it  on the film version of this concert).  All original Band members are  featured here- Danko, Helm, Manuel, Robbie Robertson, and Garth Hudson.  If  you like music from the folk-rock or blues-rock eras, you'll love The Last  Waltz.
0790729652|4.0|Well, this movie is overall an intense film experience despite a few problems.<br />The main problem of this film is the plot and story. It's basically non-existant. The film pretty much sets up the origin of the  Joker and he kills people until Batman stops him in the end. No plot  twists, nothing.<br />Another problem with this film is the lack of Batman  scenes.  Other than the opening sequence, which is done only to introduce  Batman, the only time we see Batman is when he needs to stop the Joker.  This film could be better if they simply showed more time in the batcave,  with either Bruce training or doing detective work. Also, they could have  gone for a little more action in the hand to hand deptartment.<br />But,  nevertheless, this film continues to be a dark spectacle, largely due to  Burton's vision. He creates a shadowy, gothic world where criminals seem to  be of the most vicius and evil type. Paticularly the Joker character, who  the film focused on despite the title. Nicholson's portarayl of the Joker  is right on target--both frightening and funny at the same time. Keaton's  Batman, despite the obvious physcial problems, was also a very intriguing  character we never got to learn about. His Bruce Wayne dark and tormented,  sitting in the shadows, reflecting on his past. His Batman brutually  intense, as if expressing himself violently was the only release from his  pain.<br />But what really makes this film for me, is that when they do show  the Batman, he looks dead on. Almost at one with the shadows, dark,  brooding, and mysterious. You almost never see those eyes, they are covered  in shadow the whole time.

B00004U8H4|5.0|After looking over the reviews for American Psycho I felt I'd put my two cents in. I see that some people felt the movie was sub-par and others felt it to be a Christian Bale tour-de-force, while others either liked or  disliked the adaptation to the big screen, and still others who seemed like  they didn't get the message at all. I didn't read the book before seeing  the film. It has been my experience with most books that they don't end up  making better movies. I liked American Psycho because I knew that it was a  satire of American culture in the 1980's. The film delivered a satire that  showed the extremes of our culture and also mocked it. I found the film to  have multilayers, which is a good film in my book. Plotless, not exactly,  perhaps simple, but not plotless. Here is a man who works on Wall Street.  He has no social life of his own, no ideas that are his own, no feelings  that are his own. He is breaking down mentally living in this sterile  condition in which emotions are severly downplayed, ignored or ridiculed.  What's next? The next logical step the main character takes is to kill a  transient--who he states he can't relate to. He goes on to attempt to kill  some hookers and some co-workers. All for the sake of feeling alive, of  feeling individual, of having or making some meaning out of his life. Since  it is a satire of the 1980's &quot;me&quot; culture, Patrick Bateman and  his world underline this culture to its fullest and then exaggerate it. I  thought it was well done. I can't think of any other movie that so  eloquently and intelligently mocks the 1980's culture and society. Of  course, this was only a slice of America during the 80's and not the whole  story. Christian Bale turned in a fine,  stilted/controlled/obsessive-compulsive/calculating performance of a  character that slowly breaks down and snaps under the pressure of having to  live under the oppressive circumstances he encounters. I thought it was  well directed and acted as well as written. I also have a tendency to like  films that have some element of social commentary/human condition to them.  But, people will see what they want to with any film and there are plenty  of other interpretations that can be applied to this film. I just think  it's original and re-watchable, and years from now some people will refer  back to this film as a trendsetter, because I'm sure there will be other  films that reach a wider audience that deal with the same themes touched  upon here. Oh yeah, I noticed that some reviewers didn't understand the  chainsaw scene and how no one could notice him running down the hall after  the hooker...well...isn't that just another example of the 1980's  &quot;me&quot; culture? If everyone is so absorbed in themselves, as they  supposedly were in the 80's, then no one would notice a naked man with a  chainsaw running down the hall after a hooker would they? Excellent  metaphor. Certainly worth a video rental.l as written. I also have a tendency to like  films that have some element of social commentary/human condition to them.

B00000IPAX|5.0|I handnt heard of Blink 182 until I heard All the small things on MTV, and absolutely loved it, I brought the single and the other track Dammit on the c.d. was also excellent. So I decided to buy the album to check it out  properly, when I brought the album I couldnt stop playing it, the songs on  the album are very addictive and you cant help but sing them all the time,  I also found that the songs never become boring. My favourite track on the  album is All the small things, though I like them all, Going away to  college has stronger and more passionate lyrics than the rest, and the last  track Anthem is the sillyest, though if you can understand it it is also  very funny. Blink 182 have often been accused of their music sounding the  same, im not saying it does but I think this gives them more originallity  and more style than most other punk/pop bands. I love the album it is by  far my favourite album of all time and if you like the sound of Blink, then  I suggest you go out and buy this album.

Great Cast too, Jaime Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, and Art Malik  support in this great movie. Great sound on the DVD also, and the picture  is flawless. The Action sequences are fantastic in this movie, my favorite  being the bathroom shoot out, great scene. All in all a fantastic movie by  James Cameron. Highly Recommended!

Superman II brings the magic and awe of the comic-book hero to our screens in the same, lovable mood as Superman: The Movie. The scenes between Lois and Clark Kent  as he tries and tries to persuade her to be with him are compelling. Gene  Hackman returning as arch-villan Lex Luthor and Terence Stamp as General  Zod make lovable enemies that will make you laugh and cry till the very  end. Highly recommended. See it!

B000002UA2|5.0|I understand perfectly if you are in need of more because I was hurting bad for a few weeks.  I had basically worn out all of my Floyd discs and didn't know which direction to go from there.  I own most of the Floyd  discs prior to this one and I bought this  just in case it was going to  give me more of that awesome Floyd sound.  I honestly didn't think it would  with it being a soundtrack from 72' and all but I am amazed.  It is a mix  of old Syd style along with some Dark Side.  Not too suprisingly it reminds  me of 71's Meddle which more than took care of my Floyd cravings when I  bought it a couple of months ago.  I will enjoy this one for a few months  and go on with my search.  I have yet to buy More,  Momentary Lapse,  Ummmagumma, Relics and Pros and Cons.  My favorite tracks on Clouds are  Childhood's End,  Free Four, Stay, Wot's....The Deal and Obscurred By  Clouds.  Every song is really good except maybe the very last one titled  Absolutey Curtains.  It is odd to say the least with all the chanting at  the end?   This album will not dissapoint unless you are looking for more  radio played Floyd songs.  If that is all you are interested in then go and  get Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, The Wall and Momentary Lapse Of Reason  because those are pretty much it as far as radio played songs for Floyd go.   If you want to branch out a little if you already own those for albums  then go with Gilmour's 78' solo-self titled, 71'-Meddle, 83' Final Cut,  Rogers 87 solo-Radio Kaos, Roger's 92'-Amused To Death and the newest  Floyd(gilmour) studio cd,  94's The Division Bell.  I do not recommend  anyone skipping over any Floyd release but in my opinion weakest ones are  Gilmours 84' release About Face, Nick Mason's solo stuff and 67's Piper At  The Gates Of Dawn.  Oh yea I almost forgot what I am here to say,  OBSCURED  BY CLOUDS-------------------&gt;GET IT

B000001GOZ|5.0|I started my discovery of Mahler's music with this symphony, in this recording. Suffice it to say that it has marked my musical life in a way I hadn't experienced before, and never have felt since. Of course, since  then, I have listened to at least six different other versions of this  work, nothing comes close, even by the big names (Bernstein, Haitink, Solti, Barbirolli don't touch it, in my opinion -as per a reader's comment, I indeed stand corrected: Bruno Walter never recorded this opus). Boulez has a majesty here, a so perfect understanding of this  work, that it won't probably ever be topped. The tempi are incredibly  precise, and the music flows at exactly the right pace. The march-like  feeling of the first movement is quite implacable, and all the textures and  layers of sound are clearly marked, yet I've seldom heard anything that coherent in an orchestral piece. The coup de grace, for me, was the  Andante, which, quite simply put, defines beauty in music. It touches genius, on part of both Mahler and Mr Boulez, which, as this cycle goes on, happens to be the most pertinent Mahlerian conductor out there.<br /><br />Those that say Mr Boulez is cold and shows no emotions are simply  off course, they didn't get it. There's a rather large nuance between \\"dry and analytic\\" and being precise. Precision is something to wish for if we are to understand the work to the last of its intricacies and subtleties...<br /><br />Buy this record without hesitation.  There's no chance you'll be disappointed.
B00004TWZG|5.0|I don't need to write much about this movie. It is simply a classic. If you don't own it, buy it now. It is well directed and you couldn't ask for  a better performance from the cast.
B00004STPT|5.0|The best score I've ever heard! If possible, I would have given it ten stars. The music has so much variety. From the powerful battle music to the more soft, sad music near the end of the film. It's indescribable! It's now  my favorite score (for now). And I believe that will be the case for quite  a while. I love the heroic themes Hans uses in tracks 3 and 13.<br />Before I  bought this soundtrack, I heard rumors that Hans Zimmer had copied the  music of Holst's Mars: The Bringer of War. After purchasing the soundtrack,  I compared the score of Gladiator to Holst's work and found that the music  sounds similar, but is surely not the same piece of music in any way.<br />I  only wish this CD was more complete. It is missing much of the film's  score. And the only regret I have about my purchase of this CD is that I  didn't buy it sooner. Now I listen to it almost everyday.<br />I recommend  this to anybody who loves a great score that can change your mood from  rough, barbaric battles to the soft strings and women's vocals. I sertainly  enjoy this 61 minute - 38 second masterpiece.
0446677450|4.0|The author gives an example of a conversation he had with a stellar writer where he states that he is a &quot;best selling author&quot; and not a &quot;best writing author&quot;...  This is definitely the case.<br />The core  concepts are very sound.  He doesn't fall into the trap of selling his  approach which is excellent -- but encourages the fundamentals which I  like.<br />Overall, I found this audio book very interesting, but I was bogged  down by the ramblings that didn't always support the point.  I felt that I  was listening to someone do a talk from an outline versus a well thought  out and structured discussion. (Kinda like this evaluation.)<br />The  fundamentals are sound.  Let your assets take care of your needs.  All  things are not assets...  Read the book to get the whole scoop, but those  were the key learnings for me.

What am I talking about this entire CD just flat out Rules!  Although its the blues, each  track has a distinct arrangement and wonderful interplay between the  guitars.  The pianos, bass, drums, and background  vocalists/instrumentalists all add special stylings.  Eric and BB both are  in fine form vocally as each of them sings with a ton of emotion.  This CD  has found a permanent home in my CD player and all of you should follow  suit.
0060920432|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and before reading it I was not sure if I would understand the psychological writtings on what &quot;flow&quot; is.  I was incorrect in my assumption.  <br />Mihaly's writting is very  understandable and insightful.  I was amazed at the author's extensive data  collection from hundreds of thousands of different people where they  similarly described what &quot;flow&quot; experiences meant to them.  Where  their everday life became more satisfying.  <br />If you enjoyed this book  another book you might like is called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T  WORK&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. Eventhough I wasn't sure what  &quot;flow&quot; meant before reading Mihaly's book, after reading it I can  honestly say I have many &quot;flow&quot; experiences in my life and that  is a direct result of  reading the Kanes' book, listening to their tapes  (check out the Principles of Transformation-it's great!) and attending  their seminars.  For me the Kanes' book is a practical guide to living in  the moment where life has become miraculous and satisfying on a day in day  out basis.

Everyone became slaves etc. etc. And one  man who strived to be a hero of his clan gets thrown back into the cage he  was brought up in. The message this book carries holds many similarities to  our own! This book can be boring at first but trust me, it's one of those  classic novels that you must read. Chinua Achebe wrote this book  beautifully! And I think he deserves recognition for it!

But ST2, ah ST2, that had Ricardo Mantalban giving William Shatner's scene  chewing a run for it's money.<br />In fact, Shatner is relatively subdued for  the better part of the movie. His Captain Kirk is feeling his age and faced  with an estranged son that would prefer to remain estranged. Lost love and  missed opportunities, and a tight reign from director Nicholas Meyer (Time  After Time, ST6), help keep Shatner in check.<br />Also marks the screen debut  of Kirstie Alley as Lt.

0790729725|4.0|GOODFELLAS invites comparison with the first two GODFATHER movies (forget  about Godfather Part 3!)  I found it more authentic than the GODFATHER, but  nowhere near as good a plot.  What was especially more authentic was the  fun that these criminals had as they whacked folks.  It made them far more  menacing.  The GODFATHER always struck me as so un-humorous as to be  unrealistic.  Marlon Brando set the tone with his over-lugubrious lead role  (badly thought out, I've always believed).  The result was that GODFATHER  is a kind of corporate movie--intrigue in the business world, except that  the business they are in is crime.  Of course, what makes GODFATHER 1 and 2  among the greatest movies of all time is the superb plots that grip you all  the way.  GOODFELLAS doesn't really have much of a plot, because it is  based on the true life confession of Henry Hill.  After seeing GOODFELLAS  (for the third time!) I read Nicholas Pileggi's WISE GUY, the book upon  which the movie was closely based.  If you've seen GOODFELLAS, by all means  read the book: it tells you more.  In addition, director Scorsese missed a  big bet: he ends the movie as a kind of cautionary tale--Hill winds up in a  dreary Federal witness protection program.  The real life story by Pileggi  has a much more satisfying ending, which is worth quoting in part:   &quot;Today Henry Hill and his wife live somewhere in America.  As of this  writing he has a successful business and lives in a $150,000 two-story  neocolonial house in an area with such a low crime rate that garden-shed  burglaries get headlines in the weekly press.  His children go to private  schools.  He and Karen have their own cars, and she has embarked on a small  business of her own.  He has a Keogh plan....  Henry is so carefully  guarded and his new identity is so vigorously protected by the US Marshal  Service that even the Internal Revenue had to whistle when they tried to  dun the old Henry Hill for his back taxes.  Thanks to the government for  which he works, Henry Hill has turned out to be the ultimate wiseguy.&quot;   My bottom line: see the movie AND read the book.

B00003CX7L|5.0|TOY STORY 2 is one of the exceptional examples that sequels can sometimes outshine its predecessor. With the same cast including Tom Hanks (Woody)  and Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen), TOY STORY 2 unravels the  bittersweet fate that traditional toys will one day be obsolete, replaced  by commercial computer games and toys. Such is the miserable past of  Jessie, a cowgirl doll, the product of the famous toy catalogue now  deserted by her owner. It makes a satire at the overconsumerism of today's  world and strikes a compromise between nostalgia and leaving behind the  past. Woody and Buzz through their adventures matures their thinking,  knowing that friendship is the everlasting key and are dignified to serve  their purpose. <br />Buoyant and energetic, the rambunctious cast with the  sparkling dialogue and great music pumps up the movie with gloss and  unexpected humanity. Despite the computer animation, the plot relates to  the human life, and for all the marvels of technology dished up with Randy  Newman's music including the Oscar-nominated piece &quot;When she loves  me&quot; wins over the audience with its human drama. The exciting  cirumstances at the Airport runway, saving Jessie from the clutches of an  evil toy dealer are all realistically executed.<br />A family movie that is  entertaining and conveys value is hard to come by. It is definitely a  keeper in the VHS format and like a favourite toy, it will be a long time  before you decide to  chuck it away.

It is completely unoriginal, completely stupid (no voice changer can steal someone's voice so you can  talk just like they do.), and all in all, a complete representation when a  studio wants to milk a good idea for money. The &quot;revalations&quot; in  this movie are so queer and unnessacary, when are people going to realize  you dont have to explain every little thing in a movie, you dont have to  somehow tie everything together. So, if your a fan of in your face, no  holds barred, ground breaking horror, stay away. If you like predictable  hollywood soft &quot;horror&quot;...be my guest.

B000006YMP|4.0|When ABBA split (v. quietly in 1982/3), the two amazing singers who gave the band its identity and vocal magic, took very different career paths.  Frida bravely opted for a harder-edged rock sound while Agnetha kept to the  Bright'n'Shiny Pop side of the fence.  This, her first international solo  album stands out as her best.  Everything was working:  the bright pop  songs, the look and, of course, Mike Chapman's glossy production (previous  credits include Blondie's biggest hits).  Agnetha was in great voice -  in  fact, she would not shine as brightly on her subsequent solo albums.  But I  digress....<br />The stand-out tracks include the rock-lite 'Can't Shake  Loose'.  Penned by Russ Ballard, (who also wrote Frida's terrific hit 'I  Know There's Something Going On')  it became Agnetha's biggest US hit,  reaching #29 on the Billboard chart.  The title track, written by Mike  Chapman &amp; Holly Knight is another little gem.  Agnetha wrote one song  for the album, a gentle ballad called 'Man'.  While it's not a masterpiece,  it has real charm and the acoustic guitar &amp; hammond arrangement  compliment Agnetha's beautiful voice very well.<br />As with most solo outings  by singers with famous bands, there is a fair amount of genre hopping,  albeit the most lightweight in each category.  There's  rock ('Can't Shake  Loose'); blues ('Take Good Care Of Your Children'); calypso (the rather  tedious 'The Heat Is On'); 60s pop (the throwaway 'Mr.Persuasion'); and  Manilow-esque balladry ('To Love' - a tad cloying, maybe).<br />But here's  the surprising thing....  Agnetha always shunned overt sexuality in her  image, preferring to cast a more romantic light on things.  Yet this album  almost casts her as a career strumpet.  Take the the tousled  Bananarama-in-a-brothel cover shot (where our Aggie seems to give us the  'come-hither') for example.  And what about the sub-'Je T'aime' panting on  the awful 'Stay'...  Plus, the middle section of 'Wrap Your Arms Around  Me', where Agnetha breathlessly exhorts her man as follows: 'circle your  hips... that's the way... that's the way'.  Given the importance she places  on integrity, I'm just surprised that Agnetha indulged a style that is so  much at odds with her persona.<br />Still, 'Wrap Your Arms Around Me' is, to  my mind, Agnetha's best solo album. If you like your pop light, frothy and  middle-of-the-road, give this one a whirl.e', where Agnetha breathlessly exhorts her man as follows: 'circle your  hips... that's the way... that's the way'.

Two of the most played tracks from this  album, I Wanna and Marry you are his.  With my upmost appreciation of these  two stars, one should really check out the source that these already  successful performers are profiting from.  If you like their rendition of  these two tracks your going to love Doyle Bramhall II. Just giving credit  where credits due.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|What a triumphant return to form this is for Maiden!  I never thought they'd come out with a great album again.  But BNW completely blindsided me.  When was the last time you heard IM sound this inspired?  Every song  on this album smokes.  Great production and low-key, restrained  song-writing.  It literally sounds like it came out from the early 80s.   I'm glad that Dickinson and Adrian Smith are back; at last!  One of the  best metal albums of the year!

B00000ING2|4.0|This movie features a brilliant storyline, and being directed by the same filmmakers who would later bring us 'The Big Lebowski', it was sure to please.  The movies fast-paced style is a very pleasant change from the  average fare on the market today.  This is a movie to buy, because you will  want to see it over and over again.  My one complaint is that the DVD  version doesn't provide any &quot;extras&quot;, and as stated before the  quality is only mediocre...I was definetly expecting more from this.  But  all-in-all, it is a must-have for your DVD collection!
B00000JPH5|4.0|I first saw this movie when it came out. I enjoyed it very much, mostly because I was 16 at the time and was a major Bowie fan. I liked the somewhat love story between The Goblin King (Bowie) and Sarah. Now 14 years  later, my children ages 7 &amp; 5, watch this video at least twice a week.  We also own the soundtrack, which they sing along and can tell me every  part that the song or music pertains to in the movie. Everytime Sarah has  that hallucination with the Cinderella theme, my daughter calls me and  says, &quot;Mommy, your favorite part is coming on! &quot; In a weird way I  find that part romantic. It was disappointing that this film received  lukewarm reveiws and box office receipts when it came out. Thank God for  home video! I feel it is one of Henson's best.
6305807086|1.0|Unfortunately, we're so desperate for an interesting movie these days that people can be tricked by pretentious pieces of fluff like this film.  A clever premise does not a good movie make.  Jonze cut his directorial teeth  on music videos, and this film, with its complete lack of three-dimensional  characters, dramatic structure, or any emotion whatsoever, reflects that.  Don't let your psuedo-intellectual friends trick you into thinking that you  have to like this movie, because you don't.  It's a waste.
0446525537|1.0|Three pages into this book, I found myself checking to see if it was age-specific for teenyboppers, or published years ago, before Sparks hit his stride in Time in a Bottle or The Notebook.  The poor, amateurish  writing was extremely disappointing.  I did finish the book, first because  it was just a few pages and I read it in a couple of hours, but secondly,  to see if there were any surprises in the ending.  Unfortunately there  wasn't.  I will be much more cautious in purchasing any of his future  books.
0385484518|5.0|Before I heard about this book, I never read, unless I had too. All I read was the Newspaper, and magazines. Then I saw this book. I was simply stunned about how Mitch Albom tells the story of himself and Morrie.  I  can't really base this review on comparison with other books because I  haven't read lots of other books. This book is simply amazing, I found my  self reading during classes, at work, and any time I could. When I didn't  have it in my hand, I would wait untill the next break to read it again.  I  recommend this book for a reader who has just started or is regular reader.
B00004TDTO|4.0|I bought this DVD without seeing or hearing anything about it....just an impulse buy. I am very glad that I did. I hadn't seen the movie in a long time, and thought I pretty much remembered it all.  Upon watching it,  however, I was surprised by how many times i was startled...almost as if  I'd never seen it before.  It truly made me appreciate how far ahead of its  time and how well done this movie was.  Highly recommend it to  anyone....even if you've seen it 100 times!
B000002HMH|2.0|Anybody that says that Metallica sold out with THIS album overslept the time since &quot;Puppets&quot;. &quot;Justice&quot; and the &quot;Black&quot; Album where major sellouts, but at least they were great  ones with tons of brilliant songs. &quot;Load&quot; is just bad - and I  mean not bad in a way a &quot;Kill 'em all&quot; fan would say it. REALLY  BAD. Metallica never cared much about their fans and their expectations (  they still don't do - ask Napster ) but the resaults were always good  albums. Here this line of good albums ends. Not one song that is worth  mention, Metallica are faarrr below the standards they have set for  themselves ( with all of their previous albums ). Did they ever need to  copy from other Bands until this album? No, they didn't have to, but songs  like &quot;Bleeding me&quot; are OBVIOUSLY more than inspired by Alice in  Chains. Did they ever put out songs that sounded the same? No, they didn't  but &quot;Load&quot; sounds the same all over again. We as Fans are forced  to follow Metallica in their own boredom of success and have to listen to  the poor resaults of a Band that doesn't think it's neccessary to write  good songs. I will try to predict something: Metallica will keep on making  records like this, and bore us to again until they are 532 years of age.  They have forgotten about their fans and think they are great enough to  live without their support. Support of people that sang &quot;Disposable  Heros&quot; with them. Support of people that made them what they are.  Support of people that tolorated their development until now. Even if  &quot;Reload&quot; is slightly better than this, Metallica's tombstone is  &quot;Load&quot;.
6303418287|2.0|Hugely disappointing adaptation (?) of Mary Shelley's classic novel. Even more so because so many talent was involved and a much better film was expected. Kenneth Branagh, England's wonderboy whose adaptations of  Shakespeare (Henry V, Hamlet) are extremely good and portray the explosion  of a fresh and intense new talent. Unfortunately none of that survived  here. Not as much fun as the original Universal 'Frankenstein' movies with  Karloff, and not even a trace of campiness is added. Even though Branagh's  way over the top performance could be considered campiness or simply  shameless overacting. DeNiro is a weird choice to portray 'the monster' and  even though he's no Karloff nobody can blame him for trying. Helena Bonham  Carter is surprisingly unhelpful. Ian Holm and Tom Hulce, both extremely  talented actors, are both unimpressive in their roles. This versions of  'the monster' and 'the bride' are a lot more hideous to the point of making  the audience uncomfortable and not to mention nauseous. Dizzying non-stop  camerawork and a thumping even distracting score don't help much. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!
0792833201|4.0|This movie is great Family-Fun. It's entertaining but not gory ( nobody dies within the whole movie ). The music is also very haunting and the characters are likeable and natural. I think the only Problem is the  visualisation of the mega-supernatural thing coming from the kid's chamber.  Somehow, all the magic and atmosphere the movie builds up in the first half  is blown away by the somehow silly-looking skull. But it had to be done  somehow and it doesn't keep the movie from being good. The tree- and clown  attacks are highlights as well as the Parapsychologist's hallucinations  with the meat. The film has a really beautiful photography, just check out  the scene where the boy is on the tree and sees the storm coming on the  horizon. Well done, indeed. The first sequel is also watchable, it actually  explains the story better than this one ( In the End I found myself asking  &quot;why all this&quot; ) but it lacks the suspense of the original.  Again, good with a few little weak points.
0679735909|4.0|I have just started Posession and, I must admit, it took me a while to warm up to Byatt's stilted writing style.  Some of the introductory matter was a bit tedious, but necessary.  Once the plot got rolling about 50 pages  into the book, I started getting more and more involved.  Definitely worth  the effort!
B000007T1M|4.0|I would give it 5 stars, except that radiohead's OK Computer exists, taking my 5 star rating for itself.  SOD is very good.  I enjoy hard rock, but can't stand the repetitive sound of most metal bands.  system of a down  found the right mix of power and grace, which makes it sound that much more  powerful.  can't wait for another album.
0060273224|5.0|When a lady at the bookstore handed this wonderful book to me i was a litte reluctant to start it because i had never heard anything about it before. The first time you read it is much different than the second, and  both times are great. When i first started it, i was confused, but i loved  the writing style. At all times some adventure is happening, and Garth Nix  gives you enough information to know exactly what is happening, but not  make it predictable. I loved being introduced to all the new magic and  people. I especially liked the lazy, sarcastic Mogget.I think it is a great  book, and if the heroes were younger it would rival harry potter.  I was  surprised and dissapointed to see that there were only 137 reviews for this  book, when Harry potter 4 has almost 3,000 reviews and has been out for 3  weeks. I think that everyone should read this book because you read the  book in two ways. You can read it and love the story and adventure, or you  can love the dark, evil scary side of the story and think about its ties  into real life.I highly reccomend this book.
B0000024RQ|5.0|This was the first Bob Dylan album that I ever heard, and I was transfixed.  His unique voice, coupled with the strong and passionate lyrics, all moved me and made me a fan for life.  It all starts with  Blowin' in the Wind, then the powerful and raging Masters of War, to the  funny and bitter \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" to the lovely  \\"Corrina, Corrina\\", and the bizarre and funny \\"I Shall Be Free.\\"  Funny,  passionate, and full of the political protest songs of the period, this is  one of Dylan's best.
0671034065|5.0|Excellant, kept me laughing.  The heroine was delightful and real. The hero was believeable and charming.  Enjoyable read.
0440180295|1.0|This was the WORST book I have ever read in my life!  I would'nt even give it 1 stars, I would give it -11! If you are thinking about reading this book I suggest you not. This book was very confusing, and it had no plot. I  think that there are to many good books in this world to be wasting your  time reading this horrible book!
0792151712|4.0|The full power of modern cinema brought to bear on a story of a ship reputed to be unsinkable. The soundtrack, camera work, production design are all first rate, quite marvellous in its evocation of bygone days. A  young man chances his way on to the ill-fated ship and meets the beautiful  Rose (Kate Winslet). The story unfolds of how these young people fall in  love against the background of the imperilled ship and wishes of a class  ridden society. As she is crammed into her corset and cumbersome dress,  though beautiful and refined, Rose is unhappy and wants to break free and  be herself. Young Jack is fresh from the world and an artist to boot. He  offers a view of life denied to the young woman who has everything for the  asking except the freedom to express herself. So on the ship of dreams a  passionate romance is engendered and tragedy follows as the ship sinks into  the icy Atlantic Ocean depths, taking two thirds of the people on board.   God rest their souls. A finely crafted picture, over long and sad, this is  an engaging story.
B000001Y5X|5.0|With songs like dope hat, lunchbox, get your gun, and my fave dogma this is simply put their best album the only thing dragging it down at all is the phone ringing on n on n on n on n on n on n on at the end of trak 13
0767817710|3.0|Yep, no doubt about it - Sharon Stone has carved out a place for herself in the history of film. Because of her performance in The Quick &amp; the  Dead? Course not! Because she 'stuck to her guns' (forgive the awful pun)  and brought Russell Crowe into the American film scene via TQ&amp;TD! Why  give a generous three stars? Hackman's campy villain? Nah! DiCaprio's  cartoon popinjay? No way! It's simple - they're just for Russell. His  appearance is the one &amp; only merit this film can claim. And to think  the producers &amp; studio suits didn't want him!  His performance is  1)totally subtle, 2)therefore entirely believable,(Check out the expert  gun-slinging!)and 3)oh, so sexy. Why did only the Australians rate a  version including the reputedly WHITE-HOT love scene between himself &amp;  Ms. Stone!  Yet another bad decisions by the &quot;suits.&quot; Crowe's  reformed preacher makes it worth sitting through all those endless scenes  in which he does not appear. You find yourself yearning for one more  glimpse of those flashing green eyes. Alas, there are just too few.
014028009X|5.0|Once I got used to the diary format, which annoyed the traditionalist in me, I was utterly engrossed in this book.  First and foremost, this is certainly a book that more women than men will appreciate.  I wouldn't  dream of recommending it to my husband, but my best girlfriend, in a  heartbeat!  Any woman who has ever had weight woes or relationship woes  will feel Bridget's pain, despite her frequent attempts to drown her  sorrows in what turns out to be one too many nightcaps and she ends up  paying for it somehow!  The honesty of a story with someone speaking so  bluntly about their shortcomings (binging, smoking, drinking,  relationships) is refreshing, then reality hits when she makes excuses for  her behavior in the same breath.  Haven't we all done that from time to  time?  Through it all, the reader is sincerely rooting for Bridget to  succeed in all areas, crossing fingers to hopefully see her to a triumphant  end.  So much fun, you'll no doubt be entertained!
0156711427|4.0|A book can be read and enjoyed (or despised) on many levels. I enjoyed &quot;A Passage to India&quot; because of its authentic historical flavor and largely accurate portrayal of the English colonial mindset. <br />&quot;A Passage to India&quot; is essentially a trial of attitudes. These include the prejudice and disdain of the British toward their Indian colonial subjects, the fear and confusion the British experience when confronted by a cultural and artistic sensuality that vastly contradicts their own, and the hatred a victim feels toward his antagonists' entire race. The British accord the Indians with an inferior status and consequently are unable to treat them in a just or fair fashion. As a result, the British legal process becomes more of a persecution pageant than an instrument of justice. Similarly, the British cannot accept or comprehend the sensual quality of Indian art and culture. The stiff, repressed Ms. Questead is overwhelmed by her exposure to the erotic paintings of the Mahabara caves. When she experiences a mental collapse, the British assume that her condition is the result of sexual molestation and falsely accuse Dr. Aziz of this crime. When Dr. Aziz is acquitted he develops an implacable hatred not only for the British but also for his own attorney. Dr. Aziz's attitude is a direct response to his persecution and in this sense is, itself, a product of English colonialism. <br />Eventually Dr. Aziz realizes that he must judge and accept English people on a personal and individual basis. To accomplish this, his attitude toward them must be based on his direct experience with individuals, not on either party's identity as a European or an Indian.
0375703764|5.0|... six long, scary, obsessive nights spent curled up in my hotel bed (I was out of town on business). This book... How do you explain it? Every time you think you know what it's about, another layer peels away and the big black onion you're holding begins to terrify you in totally new ways. In the long hours between midnight and morning, I found myself checking the dark corners of my hotel room just in case some small part of this story had escaped its pages and invaded my world. During each day, I could feel the book itself calling to me across the distance between my client and my hotel -- I left the book in my room so I would not be tempted to read it all day long (and probably get fired). I am not a person normally captivated by thoughts of the supernatural, but this book made me want to go out and buy a tape measure to make sure the room I was in wasn't getting larger. Read the book and you'll understand...
B00000JCOV|5.0|I first heard Wait and Bleed on the Scream 3 soundtrack and from that moment on I knew I had to have the CD.  After getting the CD, all I would listen to is Slipknot.  I now love every single track on the CD, but Wait  and Bleed is still my fave.  The heavy guitars, the pounding bass, and the  magical vocals that Corey provides are just outstanding!   And because of  all this I really must say: Now this is music!   <br />P.S. I would like  to find Slipknots first CD, Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat, so if you have it or  know where I can find it, please email me!  ( ColdComfort@2die4.com )
6305897786|5.0|Just wanted to point out that there were a lot of special effects in this  movie.  People keep saying there were any effects used.  If you listen to  Polanski's audio track, he tells you about all of them.<br />&quot;What's  wrong?  The Devil won't show up?&quot;
0783240236|5.0|Although the it was originally filmed in color, I first saw the Bird many years ago in black and white on television, and it was completely terrifying to me as a youngster.  Perhaps it's just personal perspective,  but watching the movie in color doesn't have the same impact - the black  and white effect adds an  ominous and shadowy texture that enhances the  fear and tension that slowly builds through the film.  The documentary on  the DVD on the making of the Birds was excellent although it was somewhat  shocking to see how much the actors have aged, especially Rod Taylor.  My  recommendation is to watch the movie late at night with the color turned  off, and enjoy one of Hitchcock's best.
B00004STPT|4.0|I love this soundtrack...great for driving and cleaning the house. Very moving and intriguing.
B000002IHD|5.0|This is possibly the best rock and roll outfit when they were on, Otis Redding &amp; The Stax studio and stage band behind him (Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s, more or less), and it is proven here and on &quot;Otis Redding  Live In Europe&quot;.  It's right up there in quality of rock and roll art  at its highest and greatest form, worthy of inclusion and must for those  buying only the best, whether it includes Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of  Moon&quot; or the Stone's &quot;High Tide, Green Grass&quot; or  &quot;Revolver&quot; by the Fab Four, as well.  <br />If you'll only try one  Otis album, make it this one;  although British-only released &quot;Dock of  the Bay/The Definitive Collection&quot; (Atlantic CD #9548-31709-2)is a  good second choice. There is no filler, and no weak whatsover tracks on  Otis Blue, and the songs are well-sequenced.  A VERY exciting album, very  inspired.  A PERFECT album.  A most essential album for any comprehensive  collection in rock and roll.  Comparable by way of soul recording  comparisons too, with the quality of Smokey Robinson's &quot;Going To A  Go-Go&quot; or Marvin Gaye's &quot;What's Going On&quot;. Don't hold back,  make it part of your collection.  And if you can find the Mobile Sound Lab  Gold Disc version of &quot;Otis Blue&quot;, go for that without hesitation,  too (they chose the correct one single disc to provide that treatment to).     The greatness of this recording can send shivers down your spine.  You  will never, ever second guess yourself for spending money on this one, I  guarantee you;  even if some of your purchases never lived up to their  billing, that won't be the case here.
6305892806|5.0|When I first saw this film, it bothered me a bit that it wasn't faithful to Jane Austen's original. But upon reflection and a few more viewings, I fell completely in love with it. Rozema has made a remarkable achievement,  seamlessly blending Austen's novel, letters and journals into a more  compelling story, while also adapting it for modern sensibilities. While I  love the novel, the film Mansfield Park tackles so much more than the  &quot;manuevering business&quot; of marriage and societal mores that  Austen's novels are singularly concerned with. It harshly examines the  strict limitations that women, especially poor women must endure and takes  a rare look at how slavery benefitted the British Empire.  All this serious  stuff aside, the film also has plenty of comedic moments. The dim Mr.  Rushworth and his bouffant provide some laughs, as does Fanny's attitude  toward courtship, balls and her money-grubbing cousins. And don't miss the  doped-up Lady Bertram. The entire cast is excellent, and Frances O'Connor  and Jonny Lee Miller make a sweet and aesthetically pleasing couple. For  all us girls, Miller and Alessandro Nivola make an already great film even  more of a pleasure to watch.   The only Austen film to which this measures  up is Sense and Sensibility (though I adore all the films, of course, being  an Austen buff). The costumes, the cinematography, the breathtaking shots  of the English countryside and of course the beautiful soundtrack round out  this rich confection of a movie. Watch it now!

B00004SCX6|3.0|Ok you got so many people saying her last album was bubblegum music and this one is not. So because this girl comes up stage and struts around as usual singing something, more girl power, &quot;I'M NOT THAT INNOCENT&quot;  (not that we ever thought she was innocent) makes her better and less  bubblegum. Are you kidding? Lucky is the most pathetic song I've ever heard  in my life! Who on earth has a name like Lucky and obviously we have to be  put through what Lucky's been doing.  I can't get no uh-satisfaction. I am  guilty as sinned for such a song, I was curious so I downloaded it, perhaps  expecting her to growl a bit, keeping the guitars, but no dice. Instead we  got a smooth, infested by Britney's syrupy voice remix, destroying what WAS  a good song. Ok ok..if you're a fan and love pop it was good, but whoever  says and is looking for deep lyrics, don't go looking this uh-way.

0380799006|5.0|As the oldest of four siblings, I can say quite honestly that now that I am an adult I am good friends with my brothers and sister. Even so, I truly wish that my parents had found this book when I was a kid. So much damage  and hurt feelings could have been prevented! The techniques are presented  in an easy-to-understand fashion and the cartoons illustrate examples that  parents will recognize from real life. The chapter on dealing with your own  wounds from the past was incredible. Perhaps the highest praise I can give  this book is to say that before I read it, I was extremely scared to have a  second child, but now I can approach that eventuality without fear.
0780625129|5.0|This movie was a very thought provoking movie, it leaves you with a sense that this would have happened to the family whether their father was killed or not from the way that he inflicted his thoughts towards racism towards  his family. It was a very emotional movie as the boys never really had a  chance at a normal life without racism being a big part of it thanks to  their father. Also, &amp; lastly everything goes around in a circle, if  it's not whites being racist towards the blacks, it's the blacks being  racist towards the white's. And because a white kid looks at black kid  funny or vice versa things in somones life can be dramatically changed  forever...
0060207051|5.0|I read that &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; was a great book for bedtime.  I discovered it was just fabulous.  My daughter, who is two and four months old, absolutely loves this goodnight book.  She knows practically all the  words and we read it everynight.
6305470464|4.0|When I rented this, I didn't really expect to enjoy it all that much.  However, I watched it and found it really endearing.  In all fairness, some of the plots are much more entertaining than others in this film.  The most  entertaining is between Ryan Phillipe and Angelina Jolie.  The romance  between them is incredibly jaded and innocent all in the same instant.   There are some incredibly emotional and well acted scenes between them that  are incredibly endearing.  The movie does have its weaker elements, but all  in all, it has a strong plotline.  All of the characters eventually become  intertwined at the end for what is a charming ending to an extremely  entertaining movie.
0440224764|5.0|Grisham's work keeps getting better and better. As lawyers-turned-authors go (and you could name any &quot;professional&quot; who leaves their former careers to write fiction), Grisham is in my opinion, THE best of the lot.  The Partner focuses on Patrick Lanigan, an attorney in a small partnership  in the South. Patrick builds a house of cards with deft sleight of hand,  absconding with $90 million of the firm's money that he knows the firm was  going to collect for a fraudulent case.<br />Patrick disappears for four  years, while the firm hunts him down, never seeming to get any closer to  him or leave any trace of where he has gone to next. Strangely enough, as  clever as he has been, his pursuers finally manage to find him in a small  Brazilian town, and after capturing him, begin to torture him slowly to  make him reveal where the money went. Patrick safeguards himself through  his attorney and lover, leaving the details of the money's whereabouts and  transfers to her.<br />Despite his legal acumen and planning/foresight, this  proves to be Patrick's undoing in the end, but I won't spoil your reading  by giving away much more than that...<br />All in all, this is one of  Grisham's best novels, a very intense and gripping tale of dishonesty at  many levels. Grisham subtly suggests that although a person may  &quot;win&quot;, crime does NOT pay, even if what you do is significantly  more righteous (or less dishonest, as the case may be) than someone  else.<br />Be prepared to burn the midnight oil on this one!<br />Peace out.

6304712499|2.0|I was shocked as I watched this film on my home theatre the first time. Not because the film was actually good.. no it was still terrible. Not because the extras were interesting... no, hearing Todd McFarlane rant and  rave about how he &quot;knows what is cool&quot; and is the world's savior  against the evil capatalist corperations (Ironically, Mcfarlane himself has  BECOME exactly what he used to hate so much). Not because the video was  good.. no, it's mediocre. An industry standard.<br />But that SOUND.<br />The  sound is what saves this disc for me. It's what turned a rental into a  purchase. This is the best use of surround channel sound that I have ever  heard. The rear channels (in which I ALWAYS love to hear playing. I hate it  when they're only used for ambience), as well as the subwoofer is going  almost constantly. The sound is what kept me interested from start to  finish. <br />It was almost worth it to the point that I was just about ready  to turn off the Tv and just listen.

The albums made by this configuration are really the only  ones worth serious attenion.  &quot;Volunteers&quot; shows a hard-rock band  at its peak: vibrant, committed singing and powerful, unrelenting  instrumental suppport.  If there were ever any doubts that the Airplane  wasn't a rock group, the grungy, ear-splitting music contained on this CD  should silence them.  By the way, the sound has been cleaned up as much as  possibe, given its original murky 1969 production. The album opens with  &quot;We Can Be Together&quot;, a clarion-call to arms for a generation  proclaiming its liberation from the shackles of the past and looking ahead  to a Utopian future.  Kaukonen's guitar is a piercing fourth voice joining  the vocal trio of Slick, Balin and Kantner in one of their most forceful  vocal performances ever.  The album closes on a similarly stirring note,  Balin's and Kantner's title track (sharing the same guitar lick as &quot;We  Can Be Together&quot;), which is a declaration that the revolution is at  hand and we will all have to take a stand.  The late 1960s sloganeering and  moralizing is made palatable to a modern audience through the sheer power  of the Airplane's conviction.  We are swept up in their vision.  There is  another powerful performance in &quot;Wooden Ships&quot; (better known to  audiences through the first Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash album) that features  soaring vocals on a decidedly dark vision of a post-apocalyptic society.  Other stand-out tracks are solo numbers such as Kaukonen's moving rendition  of the traditional &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; with beautiful wah wah guitar,  Balin's soulful version of Kaukonen's &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;, and  Slick's bizarre motorcycle/sex song &quot;Hey Frederick&quot;. Although I  don't feel &quot;Volunteers&quot; is the best album the Airplane ever made  (there are some terribly dated tracks such as &quot;The Farm&quot; and  &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;), in many ways it is their finest hour,  encapsulating just about everything of which the group was capable and  finally crystallizing their sound and identity for the Woodstock Nation. It  is a powerful experience, but for neophytes, look to &quot;Surrealistic  Pillow&quot; or &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; for a more approachable  introduction to this unique musical collective called Jefferson Airplane.
B000002U9Y|2.0|This album isn't awful - it's just nothing incredibly special. Meddle, Dark Side, Piper, and Wish You Were Here are all 5-star monumental albums. Ummagumma, Atom Heart Mother, Animals and The Wall are also very good in  their own way. But this album just isn't that great. If you're new to  Floyd, DON'T buy this. Floyd fanatics who think all of their albums are  brilliant are blind in their worship. Floyd is a great band, but this is  one of their mediocre moments.
B000002H6C|5.0|Heavy Metal icons Metallica's fourth album, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, is their most balanced to this point.  Lacking the weak points of previous albums, (such as Leper Messiah from Master and Trapped under Ice from Lightning)  JUSTICE is hard driving from the reverse-recorded guitars at the opening to  Blackened through the bullet speed lyrics of Dyers Eve and at all points in  between.  Unlike previous albums, JUSTICE has only one true signature song,  the sometime-ballad, sometime-aggression fest title One, which might be the  best song Metallica has ever recorded.  The title track, though extrmely  long shows some of the most intricate music ever.  The moving tribute to  former bassist Cliff Burton, To Live is to Die is one of the band's best.  The only drawback to this album is the somewhat limited bass that comes  through.  This is a tribute to the band's lack of comfortability with new  bassist Jason Newsted, who replaced Burton.  Newsted does an quality job  where he was included, but some songs including the title track and One  scream for more integral bass parts, and would pick them up in later live  shows once Jason became a major part of the band.  Buy this album, and bask  in its glory, its heavyness, and its excellence.
0802130208|5.0|I'd heard this book described as social satire told from the perspective of an educated man reduced to selling hot dogs on the streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. I knew the author committed suicide and I was  expecting bitter commentary on the absurdity and corruption of the world  that later drove him to it.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  CONFEDERACY  OF DUNCES is NOT a suicide note.  It's actually rather gentle at times.   Despite undertones of desperation and tragedy, it presents a world in which  even misfits have their role because the chaos surrounding them is  necessary to disrupt complacency and pretense. <br />It's more a New Orleans  novel than a French Quarter novel.  The quixotic hero, Ignatius Reilly,  lives uptown with his mother in a middle class neighborhood.  His pathetic  pre-hot dog employer, Levy Pants, is in industrial Bywater.  Both those  environments receive comic examination along with the French Quarter.   There is a delightful complex of subplots involving a well-intentioned  policeman, a neglected business, a pirate costume and Ignatius' enthusiasm  for founding outlandish political movements.  Almost every character  introduced gets a larger role.  Ignatius' shortcomings are as serious as  those of the people complicating his life and suspense arises from concern  that he will be ruined when the various subplots' inevitably collide.   However, there are also surprise saviors here. <br />The gay party in the  French Quarter is the weakest part, constructed from once daring  stereotypes that now seem dated and narrow-minded.  This slows the novel's  last half somewhat but not enough to wreck Toole's narrative.<br />Don't let  phrases like &quot;literary masterpiece&quot; put you off.  (It is that-  there's some G. B. Shaw, Jonathan Swift and especially Oscar Wilde behind  this, I think.)  It's a great book because it's the work of a master  storyteller.  This tale can capture anyone.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica's S&amp;M, is an outstanding synthesis of metal and classical, two styles which have more in common than most people realize.  This 2-cd set has not been given proper credit by many Metallica fans who feel that  some of the songs where wussied to fit with the symphony.  I however do not  feel that way.  In most songs the orchestra is not a prevalent sound, but  if you're a first time Metallica buyer who is unsure if you can handle  thrash metal, don't buy this first.  Some of Metallica's heaviest classics,  like Master of Puppets, sound relatively tame because the band defers to  the crowd to sing quite a bit of the lyrics.  Other songs however, are at  their best, like Fuel, which always has and always will belong as a live  song.  One, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Memory Remains sound amazing as  well, and Nothing Else Matters is more interesting with James' new  compilation of speaking and singing verses.  The lyrics are a bit difficult  to understand if you're new to Metallica's world, as James voice has  improved, but he also plays with it more, a treat for hardcore fans.  This  is NOT by any stretch of the imagination a best of CD with such classics as  Fade to Black, Sanitarium, Creeping Death, and Seek and Destroy missing,  but it does give a very good look at the band's more recent endeavors with  the Black Album and Load extremely well represented.  This is still an  outstanding album, but it belongs in the collection of a metal fan who  knows the real sound, and it's even better in the hands of someone who's  experienced a Metallica concert.  If you don't fit these criteria, I humbly  suggest listening very careful to Enter Sandman and Battery to truly  understand this classic band.
0792836014|4.0|I think this movie is the best look at Elvis up close and personal it shows him before and after his show. Although I must say it is a little too one sided, as it depicts Elvis as a great showmaster. All in all I think  this DVD really is worth it's money and a must have for anyone that  remotely likes Elvis.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is one of the best albums in the history of music.  Not just metal, ALL music.  From the comparably light classic guitar intro to Fight Fire with Fire to the grandiose drum crashing end to Call of Ktulu, this album  shows Metallica's full range of musical composition, speed guitaring,  growling lyrical genius, and an impressive array of concepts.  The title  track is a fast and aggressive look at an electric-chair execution,  complete with the plaintive moans of 'I don't want to die'.  For Whom the  Bell Tolls shares billing with One (of the later released Justice album) as  Metallica's best song, and moves you from its opening of Church bells to  the drum solo at the end.  Fade to Black, a  slower and more soulful song  about suicide and depression, is one of the band's best, and shows Kirk's  full guitar ability.  Trapped Under Ice and Escape are comparatively weak,  but are still solid metal songs, if not good ones that are merely under  rated.  Creeping Death however, is amazing.  Taken from the Hebrew story  about the final plague in Egypt, its pure adrenaline pumping sound has made  it a crowd favorite for years.  The die die chant between the 2nd and final  verses truly makes the blood flow.  The album closes with a powerful and  intriguing instrumental, The Call of Ktulu.  Many don't give this song its  due for its complexity and the adrenaline rush it can give as it shifts  gears from a low octane opening, to a speedy heart, and ending in a series  of cymbol crashes and power cords.  All in all, worth buying for any price,  and a must own for any metal fan.
B00004U30D|5.0|American Beauty is a riveting, disturbing, and brilliant portrayal of the complexities of human emotion. Superb acting by Kevin Spacey and Annette  Bening. It is a movie which inspires thought and debate. Not to be missed ,  it should be seen more than once as there are so many levels to  investigate. A marvelously engrossing and intelligent film.
6305910103|5.0|I admit that I watched the original Star Trek series when it was aired  (who didn't?), and caught the occasional re-run, but have never been a  die-hard trekkie.  When I saw &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; I  actually left the theater in the middle -- it seemed more like an  opportunity for the Star Trek crew to swear at each other and have  meaningless dialog than to present a story...then came &quot;Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan,&quot; even the title is a winner...while the first star  trek movie's title had to convince itself that it was indeed a motion  picture.<br />The powers that be behind Star Trek II made a masterful decision  by tying into one of the original Star Trek episodes for the premis of this  movie.  They brought original Star Trek fans back to the theater, and  created a new set of fans at the same time.<br />This film is a pleasure to  watch.  Ricardo does a great job as the anti-hero -- you may actually find  yourself secretly rooting for him.  This movie has plenty of action,  adventure, tough times, plot twists, and a fun story line.  Kirk and co.  find almost more than they bargained for when they accidentally run across  the genetically superior Khan and his clan again.  And what about those  little sand crawlers -- EEEEeeewwwwwwwww, now that's entertainment!   Nothing like a hazardous invertebrate to spice up your day, eh?<br />If you  are even a casual fan of sci-fi you will enjoy this film.  Give it a look!   It's well worth the price.<br />5 stars from a non-trekkie<br />Have fun, and  &quot;live long and perspire.&quot;<br />Alan Holyoak
B00000J7S8|5.0|This is not one of those cheesy &quot;romantic nights&quot; CDs.  However it will serve the purpose very well.  A friend of mine first purchased this CD as a gift to send to his father in Australia.  He listened to it, loaned  it to me, sent it to his father, and his mother loved it so much she took  it for her auto.  So now between us, we have purchased 5 copies.  It is  great music for all kinds of settings.  I love to sing along when I am  stuck in traffic.  It puts a smile on the faces of those around me.  She  has a exceptionally pasionate and sexy voice.
B00000G3PA|2.0|A couple of years ago the movie groove-thing was Robin Hood, in 1998 it was meteor and comet impact disaster-rama with shows like this one and  &quot;Deep Impact.&quot;   While this will doubtless raise the rancor of  lots of so-called sci-fi fans, this movie really stunk!  Am I ever glad  that I saved my theater ticket $ and waited for this show to come out in  the video stores.  <br />The story line was completely unbelievable...give me  a break, NASA, which has a huge cadre of excellent engineers can't come up  with a better plan than a hard-living, hard-hat oil man who has no problem  with running around his own off-shore rig shooting a shotgun at his best  worker!   Then, NASA gives up control of its resources to him, not to  mention one of its flights, to allow completely untrained oil workers to go  into space!   I won't even mention the extremely dark side of the whole  film.<br />This whole movie was about two things and two things only: special  effects and making money.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with making money, but  if you're going to spend some to make some, why not spend it to get top  notch special effects that show things that have a chance of being  scientifically and technologically possible, and that don't slam the  intelligence of the audience.<br />The acting was barely passable (and I kind  of like some of Willis' other shows) and the premis was awful, but the  worst thing about the film was that it required absolutely nothing of the  audience than that they hand over their cash and let their minds go  blank.<br />By contrast &quot;Deep Impact&quot; which also came out in 1998  was, in my opinion, a far superior piece of sci-fi than Armageddon.  It had  character development, more believable on-earth developments, and while the  off-earth action was still a major stretch, the FX wasn't the tail that  wagged the dog...there was better acting, better story line, and more real  emotion involved.<br />So, why did I give Armageddon 2 stars?  Thereason I  gave &quot;Armageddon&quot; two stars was that some of the special effects  were pretty cool to watch, but that's it.  Sorry.<br />I'm sorry that not  every film, CD, or book is worth 5 stars.  You may not agree with my view  on this film, but that's one of the beauties of the Amazon.com customer  review forum -- to share ideas and thoughts.<br />Be careful out there!<br />Alan  Holyoak
B000003H2Q|5.0|The previous reviewer obviously hasn't listened to this album very much, perhaps he started from the end of the record and then didn't want to listen anymore!  <br />There are no death growl vocals on this album, except  for the very last track, that was included as an extra on the digi-pack,  and I think it was more a wish from the record company than the band that  this older song should be included. Not that I mind personally, Aaron is  the greatest, wheter he uses death growls or sings with his one of a kind  regular vocals. <br />BTW, this is probably my favourite album of all time!
B0000025DV|3.0|And so it came to pass ... if &quot;Face The Music&quot; was the ignition, and &quot;A New World Record&quot; the lift-off, then this album,  &quot;Out Of The Blue&quot;, sees the Spaceship ELO at full throttle.  Destination : Global Superstardom.   In 1977 Jeff Lynne's unique sound of  orchestrated rock reached its zenith with the relase of this sprawling  behemoth of a double album. The beautifully illustrated sleeve of the  exterior and interior of a giant spacestation floating high above the Earth  and the lavish, intricate, portraits of the (frankly hirsute) band inside  are as well known as the music. Complete with full lyrics, never before or  since has an ELO album looked so darn good. Musically, Lynne goes all out,  and tries to outdo &quot;A New World Record&quot;... and for me anyway,  fails to do so. A lot of people will disagree with me - the high points on  this album are indeed as good as anything Lynne has ever done : the mighty  &quot;Turn To Stone&quot; single thundering along on its heavy synth-bass  opens the album; the catchy, airy &quot;Sweet Talkin' Woman&quot; follows  it up; the AM radio friendly fodder of &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; (with its  gloriously overdone, pompous one and a quarter minute coda !); the cracking  &quot;Sweet Is The Night&quot;; and who could forget the grandiose closing  track &quot;Wild West Hero&quot; - absurd, cliched lyrics - but  the sweep  of strings during the chorus are possibly my favorite ELO Moment. But  before I get carried away in the rush of sentiment, there are quite a few  lows on this album too. For a start, it's too long and there is a fair  amount of filler liberally sprinkled throughout. &quot;It's Over&quot;,  &quot;Starlight&quot;, &quot;Believe Me Now&quot; fail to impress, and if  &quot;O.O.T.B&quot; is ELO's equivalent of The Beatles' &quot;White  Album&quot;, then &quot;The Whale&quot; is Lynne's &quot;Revolution 9&quot;  : self - indulgent and boring. The &quot;Concerto for a rainy day&quot;  side seems to go on for ever. &quot;Jungle&quot; is just plain dire -  &quot;Chooka chooka hoo la ley&quot; ?  Please. The production and mixing  are spot on  however, courtesy of the great Mack, and the orchestration on  this album is as good as it ever got. Supported by a then state-of-the-art  live stage show, complete with lasers (first time they were used for  concerts) and a giant spaceship rising from the stage, this album logged  something like two years in the charts, and propelled ELO to heights of  fame that they would never manage to recapture in their later career.  Close, Jeff, but no cigar.
0790743132|5.0|A film of striking emotion that's scatheing as well as entertaing. Bogey at his best. A great film.
B000002U84|5.0|&quot;Rio&quot; was my first Duran Duran album and I've been hooked ever since.  Duran Duran's theme for their music is &quot;sex and science fiction.&quot;  &quot;Rio&quot; is true to their mantra.  In addition to  &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;, don't miss the  artristry of &quot;Last Chance on the Stairway&quot; and &quot;The  Chaffeur&quot;
6304119046|5.0|Perhaps the greatest film of all time. A film briming over with emotion- pure emotion, not some canned emotion as in some movies. When you see this film for the first time it is like being hit with a brick against your  head- the story, the sound, the camera work, the acting, and the shear  genius of Welles emitting off the screen.
B000002I2G|5.0|This fourth album by The Doors, \\"The Soft Parade,\\" is probably their most ambitious album (though not necessarily their best).  For this one they brought in a full orchestra to add strings and horns to their already  definitive sound.  The highlight of this one is the title cut, \\"The Soft  Parade,\\" a four-part offering that begins with an almost wistful feeling  and escalates into blood-pumping, straight out rousing rock, played over  Jim Morrison's cryptic and enigmatic lyrics (Catacombs/ nursery bones/  winter women growing stones/ carrying babies to the river).  Also included  is the poetic \\"Wishful Sinful,\\" a song somehow benignly disturbing when you  consider the darkness of the message that emerges from such a lilting  melody:  \\"Wishful, sinful/ wicked blue/ water covers you/ wishful, sinful/  wicked you/ can't escape the blue.\\"  There's a promise of freedom (but at a  cost) in the anthem-like \\"Tell All The People (Can't you see me growing/  get your guns/ the time has come/ to follow me down).\\"  The most well known  cut from this album is \\"Touch Me,\\" with lyrics by Robby Krieger and an  interpretation by Morrison that is open to speculation.  More equivocal  lyrics accentuate \\"Shaman's Blues (Did you stop to consider/ how it will  feel/ cold grinding grizzly bear jaws/ hot on your heels), during which  another Morrison persona emerges, one apparently close to his heart and in  being with his connection to the earth.  A call to the youth of the world  to step forward and take charge of their destiny is the subtle message of  \\"Do It,\\" while the eternal quest for freedom of mind and soul come to the  fore in \\"Wild Child,\\" which ends with the cryptic \\"You remember when we  were in Africa?\\" which helps to fuel the myth that Morrison \\"pulled a  Rimbaud\\" and actually disappeared into the Dark Continent in 1971.   Rounding out \\"The Soft Parade\\" are \\"Easy Ride,\\" and \\"Runnin' Blue.\\"   Listening now to this album from the distance of years, Morrison's insights  and attitudes seem every bit as powerful now as they did then.  When all is  said and done, this was a guy who had a lot to say, and he is much more  than the voice of a generation gone by; the songs here are further proof  that The Doors were, and are, a force to be reckoned with, and their impact  on society and a world diminishing in size and resources daily is still  being felt.  There are those who would dismiss rock n' roll out-of-hand,  and it's time, perhaps, for them to listen to The Doors; for the words and  music here can put a whole new spin on things.  After all, it's all a  matter of perspective.  And great music, which is what this album provides.
6305627347|5.0|This is the movie i ever bought.
B00000I0XW|3.0|I am a great fan of Sarah Brightman, especially viewing the &quot;One night in Eden&quot; DVD. She has such a beautiful stage presence and her voice is pure angelic.  However, the quality of this CD leaves a lot to be  desired.  I think the recording is collection from the old masters, and the  sound just is not very clear.  The sound has no definition and there is a  lot of boom to all of the selections.  Believe me, it is not my audio  equipment.  I don't think I will be listening to this CD much, despite the  beautiful songs on it.
6301871952|5.0|Note: does contain spoilers.<br />In my honest opinion,Gremlins 2:The New Batch,is a brilliant sequel to the original Gremlins.It's also the perfect  example of how a sequel should be done.We once again have a brilliantly  written story that's very tight.The Gremlins are back,this time taking over  a Manhattan SkyScraper.There much deadlier and nastier than in Gremlins  1.They drink mutagenic chemcals that cause them to mutate into very nasty  creatures.They transform into mutant spiders,Gargoyles,and one even gets an  ability to talk.The Gremlins once again employ some weaponry,including  chainsaws,machine guns,and dental drills.The special F/X are absolutely  spectacular.The Gremlin F/X are awesome,and the mechanical F/X themselves  are great.The music is magnificent, and the film NEVER gets boring.Director  Dante is even more experienced and stronger here,giving the film an very  well made and hard worked feel to it.There are plenty of in jokes and  gags,so expect to be in stitches throughout the entire thing.  Overall,Gremlins 2:The New Batch is an excellent and HIGHLY entertaining  follow up to Gremlins 1.It's also the perfect example of how a sequel  should be done.Buy it now!<br />Rated PG-13 for some menacing violence and  brief language.
0780629450|5.0|I must admit with many, Branagh was hard to take at the start as  Hamlet.  Although fantastic as a Shakespearean actor, he wasn't my favorite Hamlet.  With that aside, this is a wonderful production.  Although Helena Bonham  Carter is my favorite Ophelia, Kate Winslet was fantastic.  This full  version was a welcome interpretation of this timeless tale.  I couldn't  review this film extensively (for reasons stated below) but I can say this  is the most memorable Hamlet yet! And Alas! there is finally a widescreen  VHS version!  I was lucky to have seen this film in it's full version (4  hours and in 70mm) in the theater.  I really haven't seen it since. Why?  Because it was in 70mm, a &quot;pan-and-scan&quot; version would be  horrible!  The sets were breathtaking!  Some people may not know this: but  not only was this film in limited theater release but the 70mm true version  was even more in limited release.
0790742705|4.0|Note: does contain spoilers.<br />Gremlins is very coolmovie.Although it's somewhat dated and the sequel was a lot better,it's still a very cool movie that's well worth checking out.The story is very well written and highly creative.A Dad spots a cute lttle furry animal named Gizmo,who's from a weird line of creatures called Mogwais.He wants to buy it for his son Billy,but Gizmo's owner won't let him have Gizmo.The owner's son snatchs Gizmo and gives him to the Dad.The Dad is told a set of three rules that he must follow no matter what. 1,keep Gizmo as far away from water as possible (this includes anything with liquid).2,keep him far away from bright lights.And 3,never,ever feed him after Midnight.Billy receives Gizmo as a Christmas present.He accidently spills water on Gizmo,which causes him to spawn other Mogwais.One night,all of the Mogwais (except Gizmo) break a very important rule.They eat chicken after Midnight.This causes them to transform into scaly,vicious beasts who wreak havoc on Billy's hometown,Kingston Falls.The mutant Mogwais are called Gremlins.They attack people,hold Bartenders hostage,drive construction vehicles,and even employ some weapons in the process,including chainsaws,six-barreled pistols,and tennis ball serving machines.The special F/X are great.Although their a bit corny compared to some of the other monsters we see Today,they still are very well done.The Gremlin F/X are very cool. (...) The acting is very good and convincing.The direction from Dante is very tight and solid.Overall,Gremlins is a simply good movie. Although the sequel,Gremlins 2:The New Batch was much better in my opinion,I still liked Gremlins 1 very much.It's just somewhat dated.On a side note,although Gremlins is targeted towards kids,it's pretty violent.The Gremlins look really scary and nasty,and there's even some gore (this includes some human characters who dies during the Gremlins rampge on the town). It's a very nasty and scary movie for young kids,but older kids(9+) probably won't be too scared.<br />Rated PG for some violence and very mild language.
B000002HNR|5.0|Listening to this album for the first time during my experimentation days, 16 years old through a killer pioneer stereo, brought back to the states by a Vietnam Vet, truly altered my perspective of life, and how we are  controlled and manipulated,on all levels.<br />Listen to this album loud, as a  feeling human being, not a critic, and perhaps it will change your life,  and your perspectives. Read Morrison's book the Lords and the new creatures  for a even heavier intenser trip.
0451169514|3.0|The Movie version is superior to this in my opinion. The book is too long, and some parts are unnecessary. I liked how they handled the confrontation scenes in the movie more than those in the book, because nothing beats the  movie's sewers. For much better Stephen King, read Bag of Bones, The  Shining, Christine, and Salem's Lot. Skip out on Cujo, The Running Man, and  It.
079073463X|4.0|I am not a fancy movie critic, but I know what I like and I like this movie.  There are very few movies that leave a lasting impression on me, and Ladyhawke is definitely one of them.  The story, music (no, it is NOT  disco-medieval) and acting is haunting, funny, romantic and hopeful.  This  was the first time I  ever saw Michelle Pfiffer and I remember thinking how  beautiful and perfectly suited she was for this part.  Rutger Hauer is  absolutely dashing as a knight in black and they make a perfect pair.   Matthew Broderick provides a wonderful balance of humor and support for the  2 cursed lovers.  I have loved this movie for 15 years and it still remains  one of my favorites.  The location and scenery is absolutely beautiful.   Like I said, I'm not some fancy movie critic, looking at every aspect of a  film.  But, I can say this:  It was one of the best films put out in the  80s and I still recommend it to friends when the topic of old movies comes  up.  If you're a romantic at heart, you'll love this movie, I promise.
B000003RCY|5.0|all that i can say is wow. i had absolutely no idea that this album would be this awesome! well, for one reason, this cd is diverse, which gives it more appeal than it's younger brother, Sehnsucht.to give you an idea, i'll  review each song. Wollt ihr das Bett in Flamen Sehen: good song, fast,  repetive and long. Der Meiser: a great fast paced metal type song with some  added keyboards. Wiesses Fleisch: one of the best ones on there, very hard,  and very fast. a good example of RAMMS+IEN at it's best!Asche zu Asche:  well done, and repetive, yet very cetchy. Seemann: THE best ballad type  song i've ever heard. even though it's slow, it's very well written. Du  Riechst so Gut: very techno, very metal. very good! Das Alte Leid: dark, a  bit slow, but never the less a great song. Heirate Mich: kinda dark, yet  cetchy, and diverse. Herzeleid: awesome. very metal, and a great keyboard  solo. Laichzeit: very similar to Du Reicht so Gut. also resembles  Eifersucht from the Sehnsucht album. Rammstien: an awesome, but wierd song  talking about the airshow crash. lyrics are a bit gross, but never the  less, wonderful. if you want to see any more lyric translations, almost  every RAMMS+IEN site has 'em.
0440180295|1.0|O.K., I read it, but I literally have no idea what this book is about.  And I'm not reading it again to find out either.  Apparently, people like almost anything in life, which is really a sad commentary on the human  condition.
0440219078|3.0|What a great book!  I had a very hard time at the first of the book.  I did not know how in the world I was going to get through the first four chapters when it is setting everything up.  As soon as I hit the fifth  chapter I could not put the book down.  It was so entriguing.  It was all I  could do to keep reading to find out what happened to each character.  I  really feel like everyone that has a chance to read should start today. I  have recommended it to many people so far.  She is a very intelligent  writer.
0684800713|1.0|Let's start with the characters of the book.  They drink beer, they eat, they smoke, they sip coffee, they chat, they sleep, and then they wake up and start the whole process over.  They really don't do a whole lot more  than that and you've got to wonder why anyone would willfully chronicle  this.  They sound like early twenty-somethings on the party circuit (and we  all know how profoundly interesting that time of our lives was right?).   I'm sure there's a lot of symbolism and all of that other neat stuff  lurking beneath the surface of this story, but it's so dull, you find  yourself asking &quot;who cares&quot;?
B00004SZWE|5.0|Stevie Wonder was a superstar by the mid-seventies. He had finished a series of marvellous albums with \\"Fulfillingness...\\" in 1974; his intentions explicit in the title. He then worked long and hard on raising his own  lofty standards, negotiated an incredibly lucrative new contract with Berry  Gordy, and finally launched this double LP in 1976 by playing the entire  thing at a Motown Board meeting.<br />To be honest, I didn't like \\"Songs...\\"  much at the time. I thought it suffered from the \\"single LP spread over a  double LP\\" syndrome. The sound was surprisingly poor. The sleeve also  annoyed me, with a surprisingly unimaginative design and Motown printing  the stupid \\"Collector's Edition\\" sticker ON the cover!<br />It grew on me.  Sure, the tracks, on the whole, are longer than Wonder had done in the  past. Maybe a few are drawn out, but in the main, he needed the space to  expand.<br />And did he expand! The scope of this work is just awesome. The  first disc was, in a way, not much different from his other 70's albums. It  started with the usual straight-forward song (\\"Love's In Need...) and side  two kicked off with the obligatory funky number (\\"I Wish\\"). In between, he  gave us all sorts of tasty fare, even throwing in a Frank Zappa meets Chick  Corea's RTF jazz-rock piece, \\"Contusion\\". What was especially noticeable  was the fact that where Wonder had tended to DIY in the past, he now used a  cast of thousands, giving many of the songs on this album a huge, majestic  sound. This approach was especially evident on the second disc, which  extended his vision even further than the first. \\"As\\" sounds like a fitting  finale, except that Wonder then tops it with \\"Another Star\\"!<br />As if there  weren't enough ideas on this double disc, he also throws us four others  with which he's been amusing himself (originally on an included E.P.). One  of these, \\"All Day Sucker\\", sounds so fresh today as to be scary!<br />The  double digipak is great. The sound is much better, although it grates on  \\"Isn't She Lovely\\". Sensibly, the E.P. has been added to the end of the  second disc. And they removed the dumb sticker! \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\"  is a classic from an awesome talent. It is, unfortunately, a peak that even  Wonder would never scale again, although by this time he had given us more  than enough to keep him in our hearts forever.
0440180295|5.0|I read this book on a recommendation from my history teacher. I was kind of hesitant at first, but the story just grabbed me. I personally think Vonnegut is trying to say three things. 1) Humanity in whole doesn't  change, so war is inevitable 2) You have to do the best you can to prevent  war 3) Even during war, morals still exist One of the premises of the book,  is that history, past and future is fixed. We are like little bugs trapped  in amber, we can't escape. But I don't think Vonnegut is really saying we  have no free will, I think he is talking about society and what society  does and it drags us along, however unwilling, and we just have to do the  best we can.  For those of you who haven't read it, the story goes as  follows. Billy Pilgrim, an ill-prepared chaplains assistant, becomes a POW  for the germans and witnesses the bombing of Dresden. Several years later,  he is kindapped by aliens from the Planet Tralfamadore, who live in four  dimensions. It also tells about his life twenty five years later. the three  strories are wovwn together, becasue supposedly, the Tralfamadorians taught  Billy how to time travel and he does so. I won;t spoil the rest, for those  of you who haven't read the book.
B00000IWVS|2.0|Freud would have been proud of Martha Argerich, for her playing rarely transcends raw lust, and the necessity to sublimate it in said 'virtuoso' playing...don't look for any philosophy/poetry here, for it is neither a  broad world-view, nor a profound insight into the human  condition...escapist, sexual nonsense.  I suppose this sort of thing is  necessary, but why not tune into Radio 1 for a few cheap pop songs, instead  of enduring the depressing experience of Argerich demolishing Chopin's  sublime 3rd sonata, or perhaps you prefer her desecration of the  scherzo...it's your choice.
B000002J03|5.0|As stated in the title, Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band of all time (tied with the Beatles, I believe, but I actually enjoy listening to Led Zep more).  This is just an indisputable fact, because of the depth and  breadth of their songs, and their unsurpassed musical ability. Speaking as  a psychotherapist with a Ph.D., I have to say that those reviewers out  there who say negative things about Led Zeppelin need to get their heads  examined!
0767903854|3.0|Bryson's descriptions of Australia are fascinating and evocative at his best.  Unfortunately he's not always at his best, but in a pub whining about the obvious under the pretense of discovering local character.        I'd compare &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; to a fantastic Lobster  Thermidor sauce with mostly stale cheerios lurking down under, and a few  bits of succulent lobster to keep you in the hunt. Occasionally there's a  delight to savor, but mostly a disappointment that so much potential is  wasted.      Case in point:  Uluru/Ayers Rock gets a few pages because  Bryson couldn't read the scale on a map and didn't make overnight  reservations.     I also found it odd that while Bryson freely spouts  opinions on the Aboriginal Australians and their part (or non-part) in  Australian society, apparently he couldn't be bothered to talk to someone  of Aboriginal heritage. Guess they weren't in the restaurants &amp; hotels  he frequented except to leave their artwork.     Lazy writing.      But at  least he shared stromatolites.
B000005PMN|5.0|I have this movie and it is one of my favorites of all time. It is short and sweet with no extra &quot;rubbish&quot;. Please see this sweet movie!
6304119046|2.0|OK, this was an important film for its time -- noone can dispute that. It revloutionised the use of the camera amd the use of space in the mise-en-scene. But the thing is that the story is just unbearably dull! The  characters are too hammy and look like they are acting and fail to get the  sympathy of the audience at any time. Kane is a jerk who has about as much  self-understanding as a two year old kid. How can most people relate to  him? if you are really into the history of film or cinematography, this  movie is of immeasurable importance and it should be studied. But if you  just want to see a good movie with characters that you can relate to and a  plot that is interesting, go elsehwere . . . this fiulm is all art and no  soul.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This album is a hit cuz' eminem be singin' from the inside the lyrics are from the world around him its jus like lookin' around and singin' bout what you lookin at but thats jus like what eminem is doin' he is singin' bout  the stuff around him, those who like rap i recommend this cd to them...
0805017305|5.0|I always wondered how the Native Americans ended up on reservations.  Why did they give up there land?  Why didn't they just live peacefully with the whites?  Why did they end up on the worst land in the nation?<br />This book  answers all those questions and more.  I am saddened by the amount of  treachery involved in the treaties with the Indian tribes.  I had never  heard an account told from the tribe's perspective before and wow!  Is it  ever different from the history taught in school!<br />This book is a hard,  emotional read and worth every second.  I also greatly enjoyed the pictures  of the Chiefs and others involved.  There are some truly beautiful  portraits.  I would say if you only read one book about the settling of  America read this one.
0345409671|2.0|A good enough novel from another author perhaps, but from Anne Rice?  It feels as if she has straight jacketed herself in the mythic laws of both her own vampire history and those of the christian church.<br />Too much  retelling here and not enough new content.<br />Lestat has descended into  neurotic paranoia, as well he might being pursued by the devil, but who  wants to read about a nervous wreck?<br />Gone is the suave charm of the  vampires as instead of being the hidden power amongst mortals they chitter  and whine and are changed from being beguiling into wretched pathetic  uninteresting characters.<br />Does Lestat's final state indicate redemption?   Is his wound at the hand of Memnoch and his understanding of the suffering  in hell a way for he himself to be redeemed?  Is he a more extreme form of  Roger or even Uncle Mickey?  I was left not caring, Lestat is transformed  from a fiery star into a vapid lilting weasel spouting pastel philosophy.
0425163407|2.0|I've been a fan of Patricia' Cornwell's books for some time, and this one just not up to her usual level of quality.<br />The book has a wonderfully interesting idea regarding the MO of the killer, but dissapointingly, this  idea along with the character of the killer, is not really developed to the  extent that you expect from earlier Cornwell novels.<br />Most of the book  revolves around sub-plots of the relationships between the many characters  that have become part of Kay Scarpett's life over the series of Novels.  Unfortunately  this comes at the expense of the story about the villain and  the crimes.<br />My preference is for the earlier, leaner, Kay Scarpetta books  that concentrate on the murder mystery, the science of forensics, and the  interplay between Marino and Kay.
B00004TR2G|5.0|The year was 1975 and the film was JAWS.  A film that had more than its share of problems being made.  Finally, after Speilberg and Co. finished the film they showed it to a test audience.  The response was so, so.  As  producer David Brown said, &quot;Johnny Williams still had not added his  music.&quot;  Speilberg said that &quot;half the success of JAWS is do to  the score.&quot;  Can you imagine this now classic film without this  terrific music.  Finally the complete score is available fully re-mastered.   Everybody knows the shark theme.  It is classic.  Strings that start of  slow and build as a sense of danger increases.  You're hearing it in your  head right now.  But, what really makes this score is the music that  accompanies the last third of the film as the Orca hunts (or is hunted) for  the shark.  The music is amazing and builds such a sense of tension that  one can barely sit still.  This is a soundtrack that no film buff should be  without.  It COMPLETES a soundtrack library.
B000002UYZ|5.0|this is the greatest beatles collection u can have!  it brings back all of the oldest memories of my child hood in albama... if you like the beatles, you have to have this one!
B00003CXFU|5.0|This is an Oscar worthy performance by Julia Roberts. She portrays Erin Brockovich...a lady who has no money to spare. This film was done so well  and I give so much credit to Julia Roberts because she not only portrays  Erin, but she acts like she is the real life Erin Brockovich. Sometimes  actors play real serious in films, and Julia is one of those people. Sit  down relax...and enjoy this story because you will love every minute of it!  5 stars all the way!
B000000OA6|5.0|It's been nearly 10 years now since Innuendo came out. I bought this CD the day that Freddie Mercury passed away in November of 1991. I listened to Innuendo for days on end trying to sort out the feelings of loss and found  within the songs Freddies pain, sorrow and eventual longing to be freed  from the ravages of AIDS that had destroyed his body but not his spirit.  That longing and eventual acceptence of his own mortality is taken further  in the followup CD Made in Heaven, which is also a fantastic album. For  Queen fans, this caps 20 years of great music and as a fan for most of  those years, Innuendo and Made in Heaven prove that this group still had  the ability to stir my soul. Queen will always live on in the wonderful  music.
B000002UAX|5.0|This would be the first Album I would buy if I was starting my Beatles collection.Everything in music is on this one record.From the Beach Boys sound,&quot;Back in the USSR,&quot;the sexual,&quot;Happiness is a warm  gun,&quot;to the hard rock,&quot;Helter Skelter.&quot;I got this album  after I read &quot;Helter Skelter,&quot;about the killing of Sharon  Tate.Charles Manson thought the Beatles were telling him to get ready for  the African American's taking over the county with songs like &quot;Littles  Piggies,BlackBird,Sexy Sadie,&quot; and of course,&quot;Helter  Skelter.&quot;My favorite cuts on the CD are &quot;Dear Prudence,&quot;  (John wrote this for Mia Farrows sister while they were in India.)&quot;The  Continuing story of Bungalow Bill,&quot; (with Yoko Ono singing  backup.)&quot;While my Guitar Gently Weeps,&quot;( Eric Clapton on Guitar)  and the weird,&quot;Revolution9.&quot; (when the voice comes in and  says,&quot;Number9Number9&quot; play this backwards on your turn table,and  its says,&quot;Turn me on Dead Man,Turn me on Dead Man&quot;) I did this at  a party once,and scared the hell out of one of the girls.After you play  these two CD's,the last song you hear is Ringo's,&quot;Goodnight.&quot;Its  almost like the Beatles telling us,&quot;I hope you enjoyed our two hour  party.Please come back again.&quot;I know I have over and over again.
B000002UDB|5.0|The amazon.com reviewer states that this cd/lp sounds more like a collection of singles rather than an album, and there is a very good reason for it, for that is exactly what Magical Mystery Tour is, for the most  part. The Beatles never went into the studio to record what would  eventually become MMT, rather, this album is based on an ep (extended play  disc) originally released in Britain along with the television film, with a  handful of previously released singles added to the mix for the creation of  a &quot;new&quot; album. In fact, this &quot;album&quot; was not even  released in Britain until the late '70s, being available only in America  and parts of Europe. <br />     Having said this, it must be added that the  product is remarkable. On the old lp, the songs for the British ep  constituted the first side (which is now the first six songs on the cd) -  the strongest cuts being &quot;I Am the Walrus,&quot; &quot;Fool on the  Hill,&quot; and &quot;Blue Jay Way.&quot; &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; was  inspired by an actual event, friends of George Harrison losing their way in  the &quot;fog upon L.A.,&quot; but as with any Harrison song of this period  the outward lyric conceals (sometimes subtly, often explicitly) themes  related to his growing mysticism. &quot;Fool on the Hill&quot; is more  melodic McCartney, evoking a sense of inexplicable isolation without the  obligatory trace of anxiety often present in this kind material (as  conceived by lesser artists). THE masterpiece of the old ep/lp  &quot;A&quot; side is Lennon's &quot;I Am the Walrus,&quot; a Lewis Caroll  type surrealistic journey that contains everything from transcendental  mysticism (&quot;I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all  together), Dadaistic word-play (&quot;Semolina Pritchard climbing up the  Eiffel Tower&quot;, &quot;goo goo goo joob&quot;), Carollian non-sense  verse (&quot;elementary penguins singing Hare Krsna man you should have  seen them kicking Edgar Allen Poe,&quot;)  surreal social  commentary(&quot;corporation tee shirt stupid bloody tuesday&quot;)  Daliesque weirdness (Yellow matter custard dripping from a dead dog's eye)  and Shakespeare (the snippet of the BBC broadcast of King Lear at the end  of the song). Musically the song is organzied chaos, driven by Lennon's  powerful singing and channeled by George Martin's savvy production. In all  of rock, there isn't a song like it - and very few songs that can come  close to its overall power. The remaining &quot;ep&quot; songs, &quot;Your  Mother Should Know,&quot; &quot;Flying,&quot; and &quot;Magical Mystery  Tour,&quot; round out the remainder of this segment of the cd. Of the  three, the latter is the best song, a delightful spontaneous romp inviting  the listener into the experience, somewhat reminiscent of the opening of  *Sgt. Pepper*, but not quite as musically memorable.  &quot;Flying&quot; is  pleasant enough, but the closest thing we get to filler on a Beatles album.  &quot;Your Mother Should Know&quot; also fits that description, a smooth  melody, and quite inoffensive, but only a mild prelude to the great song  that follows it (&quot;Walrus).<br />    Side &quot;B&quot; was cobbled  together out of a collection of previously released Beatles singles, going  back to late 1966 (&quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields  Forever&quot;) and running through the Summer of Love (i.e., the summer of  1967, represented by &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; &quot;Hello  Goodbye,&quot; &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot;). &quot;Penny Lane&quot;  is a McCartney masterpiece, Paul's reverie about his youth in Liverpool.  Few songs match the images that Paul conjures about the sights, sites,  smells and sounds of his younger days, all of which is weaved around  another perfect McCartneyesque melody. &quot;Hello Goodbye&quot; is another  song that is mostly Paul, and while it is not nearly as good as &quot;Penny  Lane&quot; or &quot;Fool on the Hill,&quot; it helps the album move along  in the transition from John's incomparable Walrus into the rest of the  record. &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot; is another effective piece from  Lennon, combining elements of whismy, doubt, confusion, hope, suffering,  and ambition in a way that only John Lennon at his best could. &quot;All  You Need Is Love,&quot; is yet *another* masterpiece (that word might be  overused if applied to other groups and albums, but not here with the  Beatles - for it often seems that &quot;masterpiece&quot; and &quot;Beatles  song&quot; are almost identical terms) - John's anthemic testament to the  spirit of the times, a song of great dignity, optimistic sincerity,  hope-filled exhortation, and unbounded compassion. With this song the  Beatles culminated an artistic process that began with &quot;The Word&quot;  (Rubber Soul, '65) and &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows (Revoler '66), running  through the album *Sgt. Pepper's*, and reaching it's denoumenent with this  beautiful expression of humanity's great potential for love. This might be  the best song ever written by the Beatles - but there is other candidates  for that accolade, and one of them can also be found on this very disc.<br />    &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; was conceived by Lennon in the  latter part of autumn, 1966, and brought into the studio as part of the  project that would become &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club  Band.&quot; The Beatles intended to include this and &quot;Penny Lane&quot;  on the &quot;Pepper&quot; (can you imagine?), but when pressured by EMI to  get a single out (to quell rumors of the Beatles disbanding), the Beatles  decided to finish both songs and release them together on 45rpm in January  of '67 (this in the wake of their stunning announced &quot;retirment&quot;  from touring a few months earlier). This is a true example of a  &quot;double A&quot; single, both songs so great that neither is really a  &quot;B&quot; side piece. While both songs are among the Beatles best, of  the two, it is &quot;Strawberry Fields&quot; that is truly extraordinary; a  sonic masterpiece (again) that introduces unprecedented sounds, musical  phrasings, lyrical musings, and overall structural beauty that remains to  this day one of the most creative landmarks in the history of music (and I  mean music of *any* kind). If *Sgt. Pepper* is the most important album in  rock history, this is the most artistically important song, and not only in  the history of rock, but it might be the most important song of the  post-WWII era (only time will tell in the end). Like Paul, John also takes  us back to his youth, but in a way far different from his songwriting  partner. The mood and emotion evoked in this piece are beyond my poor  powers of description, it is truly a song in which one can get blissfully  lost. (I also recommend listening to the three takes also available on  Beatles Anthology 2, disc 2, for a sense of the songs development and  structure). Strawberry Fields Forever embodies Beatles artistry - and as  such is a song without comparison (what other song resembles it?) and with  few peers (numbered on the fingers of one hand). There is nothing but  dream, magic, and  truth in Lennon's great achievement, and for this reason  alone, *Magical Mystery Tour* as we have it today is an essential recording  for any lover of any kind of music.<br />    If you don't have it get it, when  you get it, listen to it carefully, especially &quot;Strawberry Fields  Forever,&quot; &quot;All You Need is Love,&quot; and &quot;I am the  Walrus.&quot;
B000022TTS|1.0|&quot;Titanic&quot; is a film that wants to be an epic like &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; or even &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. When I saw it I couldn't  believe that people actually thought this was good cinema! Come on! The  acting wasn't even near top noch, the story a total blow, script really  nothing! Even the soundtrack was just, oh too simple! And I love James  Horner! The special effects were very good but otherwise this is just a  &quot;wannabe film&quot; that actually got somewhere.
B000001Y5X|4.0|While the other bands of the time (KoRn/LimpBizkit/FearFactory) were more concerned with how they sounded as opposed to what they said, here is a band who puts a great deal of thought into their lyrics and still sounds  good too. <br />Listening to the lyrics on this album, they might not make a  lot of sense, but it's really easy to take the themes presented in this  album to another level of depth. This album prides itself for being a  self-proclaimed showcase of American Family Values and Morals. Which is not  only interesting, but ironic in that... there are none!<br />Unlike KoRn, both  the sound AND lyrical content of this debut are self-evolving and  shapeshifting in amusing and awe-striking ways.<br />Intense. Notable for  references in audio &amp; video relating to the 1971 family film WILLY  WONKA &amp; THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY and for an audio include of Mink Stole  losing her mind from John Water's film DESPERATE LIVING following the  silence on #13.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This is a AWESOME cd I listen to it 24/7!  My boyfriend is the one who got me started on liking Eminem!

This is Totally the BEST  CD in the world!
6305311463|5.0|This is one of my favourite films! I can't believe some of the reviews  other people have posted. Armageddon is everything an action film should  be. It contains suspense, fast paced action, great special effects, a good  soundtrack along with other elements.<br />There is nothing wrong with the  plot, just because its improbable that an asteriod could destroy the earth,  doesn't mean it won't happen! I like the characters, they all have their  unique characteristics. And who said the film has no emotion? You must have  a brick for a heart! When my sister watches this film, she always cries at  the end when Bruce Willis gives his &quot;goodbye&quot; speech to his  daughter.<br />You need to stop looking at this film and picking out all the  &quot;holes&quot;, just clear your mind and sit and watch this highly  entertaining visually impressive film!<br />Enjoy! :)
B000002UW1|5.0|Maybe it is due the success of Automatic and Out of Time that this album remains largely forgotten by those in the know. However, this release blazed the way for the band's prolific future offerings. It set the trend  for the masterpieces to come and gave the band the necessary exposure that  they so dearly needed. This can, in part, be attributed &quot;The One I  Love&quot;, the band's first #1. Back this up with &quot;Exhuming  MacCarthy&quot;, &quot;Finest Worksong&quot;, &quot;Disturbance at the  Heron House&quot; and the ever popular &quot;End of the World...&quot; and  the magnitude and splendour of this album becomes clear for all to see.  This goes beyond being an album that is only of importance to fans of the  band, this is a piece of rock and roll history. Enjoy!
B00000G3PA|3.0|This was an absolutely great special effects masterpiece.  Check out the scene where the train station gets blown to bits, the demise of the empire state building etc.  The sound is brilliant and the images are crisp and  clear.  The only problem that I had was that so many things went wrong.   Shucks, I mean at the end of the movie so many things had gone wrong on the  astroid that it was a pure miracle any of the crew survived.  What I also  liked was that it kept me emotionally hooked in through most af the show.   If you like scf-fi, Bruce Willis and the lot, it's a must have.

B00004T1C8|4.0|The kids love this accessory to their wooden train track. I was not aware just how loud it was when I purchased it, and may not have bought it if I  had known. However, the kids absolutely love it, which makes up for the  ear-ache it gives everyone else! And I know that the kids will play with it  for years to come, unlike other more expensive toys. An ideal present to  give your friends' kids, just to see the annoying reaction on the parents'  faces when they hear the noise.<br />On the design-side, it looks great, but  would have benefited from the &quot;walkway&quot; on the top of the tunnel  being the right height to have allowed ascending and descending take to be  laid on it, i.e. like a bridge. It is about 5mm too low for this, which  frustrates the kids.
B000002MU3|3.0|After releasing Auotmatic for the People, Monster is a let-down. Yes, it was going to be very hard to achieve as much with this release as the previous, but the new direction that the band has taken here is  disappointing. They have cast aside all that made the previous three albums  special to take on a bold new approach and it was a failure. Although there  are winners like &quot;What's the frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Strange  Currencies&quot; and the moving tribute to Kurt Cobain &quot;Let me  in&quot;, these tracks are diamonds in the deep rough.
0393312836|5.0|Only a complete fool could write this off as an excuse to write about rape and ultraviolence. This is at heart a genuine attempt at black [and sometimes subtle slapstick] comedy. The film is a terrible interpretation  of this excellent book, and just to correct one reviewer, it was not banned  for copycat crimes or anything of the sort. It was *WITHDRAWN* by Kubrick  himself after his family received death threats. The book is an essential  read and the Nadsat language is easy to decode; you must read this book.
B00004THAY|1.0|Riding with the King....  Yes, and not listening to what I'm doing. Why the hell didn't these two call it: Earning money without work? Two names, making you believe in big things to come. But, no way. It's only two old  men and a lack of new ideas. We all know that Clapton is not god anymore  and B.B. King will not be the one re-inventing the blues. But we love them  for what they are. But there was really no need for this CD. I can only say  that I wish I kept my money.

B00000I8UD|5.0|why am i never surprised by the utter brilliance of david sylvian? DEAD BEES ON A CAKE is lush and beautiful. as experimental as ever in different genres (jazz, blues,east indian), sylvian has yet again woven a gorgeous  tapestry that is sensual and lovely. you might call this a follow up to  SECRETS OF THE BEEHIVE, albeit more mature and full of hope. this one comes  highly recommended for those days you want to relax by yourself, or on  those days when you are lazing in the arms of your honey. WONDERFUL!

B00004U45G|5.0|I came to the album as a huge Zep fan and a person who liked the Black Crowes but wasn't too familiar with them beyond their hits.  I came away with a great appreciation with the Black Crowes.  One of the most  overlooked facets of Led Zeppelin was how subtle some of their music was in  places.  For example, John Bonham, who will always be sorely missed, could  do so many little things on the drums.  The Black Crowes are extremely  talented and provide a lot of umph (that's a technical term) I haven't  heard since Appetite for Destruction.<br />The selection of songs is  wonderful.  A lot of Zeppelin songs one doesn't hear too much on the radio.   Besides &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, these  are the Zep songs I love but don't get overplayed.  The raw energy in their  performances is evident.  Jimmy Pages has his licks back.  He sounds like a  man rejuvinated  by his mates on the project.  The old blues tunes come off  well and are fun.  I am especially fond of the rocking version of Oh Well,  which was a Fleetwood Mac tune. <br />This album just plain rocks.  I miss  hearing good guitaring so badly in today's whiny post-grunge, alternative  world, and this sorely fills that need.  Buy it if you love fun, rocking  music.
B000005L86|5.0|If you collected the best cuts from all of Bob Marley's records, this one would still top it.  Why?  First of all, the production by Lee 'Scratch' Perry, is sheer genius even though it was recorded on a Teac 4-track  machine as late as 1976! You feel like you're getting pulled into a cave by  the mixture of spacy ambience and monstrously deep bass and drums.  Second,  the vocals by Cedric Myton and Roydel Johnson are beyond genius, they're  magical, like a combination of Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye floating in  outer space.  Third, there's a defenite all encompassing good humor or  'postive vibration' underlying things even when the lyrics are quite  serious.  It doesn't try to drive its point home with a hammer but rather  convinces all the more effectively with the unrelenting beauty of the  music. I repeat, you cannot do better than this record if you like Reggae  and Soul music.
B000002G7E|5.0|Many people have spoken of the strong influence that the Velvet Underground had on other musicians and groups.  While true, this is a bit misleading, because there has never been an album, and will never be an  album, quite like this one.  Not even other celebrations of demented noise  that came after it, like Eno's Here Come the Warm Jets, or certain tracks  from Smashing Pumpkins' Melon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, can do more  than come close.  The vicious squall of &quot;White Light/White Heat,&quot;  which refuses to die even as it is fading out, sets a tone which barely  lets up for thirty-five minutes.  The sturm-and-drang of &quot;The  Gift&quot; and &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; barely prepare you for  the scream of &quot;Sister Ray,&quot; which hasn't aged a day.   Paradoxically, my favorite song may be &quot;Here She Comes Now,&quot; a  strange little oasis in the middle of this electric storm. Yet even this  slower song has frayed nerves, as if it were afraid of being crushed by the  monstrosities around it.  Unforgettable.
0446677450|5.0|If you find finance and business books boring, you will love reading this book.  Reading Rich Dad, Poor Dad is like reading a thriller.  I couldn't wait to find out what happens next, what new knowledge will spring up.  I  was willing to stay up until 4 AM reading, not easy with a 15 month old. In  fact, I finished Rich Dad, Poor Dad within a day.<br />The chapter on Assets  and Liabilities is worth the price of the book.  Knowing what I know now, I  know I will recover the cost of the book.  Frankly, I feel I will recover  or earn quite a bit more.<br />Rich Dad, Poor Dad is a worthwhile purchase.   It provides a lot of information.  I may not choose to be a big game player  just yet, and the information allows me to start small if I choose.<br />Right  now, I'm thinking:  I can definitely minimize my liabilities and enhance  some assets.  I will, however, have to work on paying me first.  I know I  should do it, but it's hard to practice.  I'm working on it though.<br />Jenny
B000002HMH|4.0|It's June 4, 1996, and the second I get home from school, I'm off to buy my copy of Load. I get home, pop it in (after noticing all the differences in the album's art and layout, etc), and give it a listen...<br />At first, I really liked it. But I didn't like it because I thought it was a high quality album. Quite frankly, it was a matter of &quot;Hey, this is Metallica...it has to be good.&quot; So I liked it.<br />After listening to Load and only Load for a couple months, I basically stopped lying to myself and took out ...Justice and Puppets. Load sat with the rest of my CD's for the next couple years, only dusted off occasionally when I go through one of my &quot;Metallica&quot; stages (when I have an uncontrollable urge to listen to Metallica and only Metallica).<br />In the past four years, my taste in music has changed quite a bit. And while I still think Metallica is the best band out there (and has been since the early-80's), I will take out an album by Failure, Elliott Smith, or The Flaming Lips before I listened to Megadeth or Pantera. So now, for the first time in 4 years, I'm able to give my fair and objective opinion of Load, without saying &quot;It's good cuz it's Metallica&quot; or &quot;It's bad cuz it ain't heavy enough.&quot; <br />My review: Load is a solid record.<br />Beyond that, there's not much I can say that hasn't been touched on in the last 253 reviews. All I can say is that I listened to it last night for the first time in months and months, and it blew me away. I suppose the shock value of &quot;Oh my God, this is really different&quot; is gone, and all that's left is the music. <br />And the music is good.<br />Take it for what it is, I suppose. You don't compare The Division Bell to Dark Side Of The Moon, and you can't compare Load to Master Of Puppets. Look at it as what it is, make your mind a clean slate, and listen to it beginning to end...you may be pleasantly surprised.<br />Now I can see that Load is a great album. It only took me four years to realize it.
6305905401|1.0|I was holding this movie in high hopes before I saw it. Now I wish I wouldnt have wasted 2 precious hours out of time that I can never bring  back. From the very beginning the movie presents a goofy undertone and it  never stops. By the end of the movie all you have, as Roger Ebert says, is  unanswered questions and unquestioned answers. It seems that everything is  conveniently placed for the characters main benefits. Like the mysteriuos  blonde woman (who you never find out who she is). The movie is slow and  dull. The dialogue is cheap and completely unoriginal. The vague shots in  the movie have no symbolism whatsoever. And the ending, hah dont get me  started. The movie makes no sense and it seems like it didnt need to make  any sense. Thumbs down.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mocking Bird has a timeless quality -- people of various generations and cultures have embraced it. This is -- without a doubt -- one of my all-time favorite novels. I marvel at Harper Lee's  amazing language and compelling story of Atticus Finch and his two  children, Scout and Jem. Atticus has decided to defend a young black man  accused of raping a white woman. Set during the Depression in Alabama,  defending Tom Robinson is not an easy task. The whole town is against what  he's doing. Lee touches on some very sensitive subjects, like the caste  system, separation based on class and racism. I love the fact that the  story is told through the eyes of Scout and Jem -- the children talk with  honesty, humor and innocence. Also, I am awed by Atticus's fatherly warmth  and family values. With great characters and a tender story, To Kill A  Mockingbird is an everlasting treasure that should be read more than once.
6300269639|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! Great suspence, great  characters... and the final part is simply incredible! Do you remember the  moment when our hero saw the Mig 31 (it seems part Mig25 and part SR71!)  for the first time in the hangar? It was a shock for me! And I hope you  remember also the great videogame (lasergame) based on the movie... A  cult!!!
B000002H5I|4.0|This has to be one of the most unique CDs in my collection. Every song is good and Tracy's Chapman's beautiful,down to earth voice greatly expresses them. This CD is probably best known for  Fast Cars which is a good  song,but in my opinion,not the best on here. That title would have to go to  Talkin 'Bout a Revolution or Baby Can I Hold You Now. This album even has  an acapella track called Behind the Wall which Tracy Chapman does an  excellent job with. So why did I give it 4 stars? Every song is good(no  need to skip tracks)but with the exception of maybe Talkin 'Bout a  Revolution and Baby Can I Hold You Now,there aren't really any outstanding  tracks. Yet,for any music-lover,you haven't experienced true musical  expression until you've heard Tracy Chapman.
0451160916|5.0|Here's the deal with The Shining:  It's Mr. King's best.  I've read all his novels from Carrie to Pet Sematary (The Talisman is next on the list), and The Shining beats them all.<br />I don't usually get a very overwhelming,  sustained scare from any novel, even from &quot;the Master of Horror.&quot;   With The Shining, however, I literally could not read more than a few  chapters at a time without some sort of break, and several deep breaths.

0671578855|4.0|Bujold's Vorkosigan series is one of the best things going in science fiction.  This entry is lighter, less serious, and somewhat less exciting than others.  While not reaching the heights achieved by classics such as The Warriors Apprentice and Vor Game, this book still entertains.  While at  times the book strains to achieve a consistent tone, it is filled with  humor, well-drawn characters, and Bujold's trademark epigrams.<br />If you  haven't read the other Vorkosigan books, I wouldn't recommend starting  here.  If your not sure whether you'll like this book, the publishers web  site has 10 chapters online...

B00004THAY|5.0|if you like either artist, you can't help but become infatuated with this body of work. most albums contain one or two songs that you rarely listen to because they may not be as appealing as the rest.  it won't happen with  this cd.  every song oozes with the soul of mr.'s king and clapton.  empty  your 5, 50 or 100 cd chambers and only insert this one in the player.  once  you play it, it's the only one you'll want to hear.
0060975768|5.0|This outstanding account of the first major battle between American and North Vietnamese forces in the Vietnam War tells in gut-wrenching, eye-watering detail what close combat is all about. Authors Hal Moore and  Joseph Galloway (Moore commanded the 1st Sqdn., 7th Cav., one of the two  squadrons involved; Galloway was a journalist on the ground with Moore)  have prepared a carefully researched, well documented account of U.S. and  North Vietnamese actions at Ia Drang Valley in the fall of 1965.  Importantly, they have drawn not just on American sources and their own  experiences, but on official and personal accounts of their former  enemies.<br />Ia Drang featured the new U.S. battlefield concept of  airmobility and the North Vietnamese decided to give battle in a desperate  attempt to find out the best way to deal with American helicopters and fire  power. When Lt. Col. Moore and the 450 troopers of his 1/7th Cav. air  assaulted into a small clearning in the Ia Drang Valley they were  immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese regulars. The fighting  that ensued consumed Moore's squadron. The enemy increased his forces and  applied even greater pressure on the Americans, and a sister unit, the  2/7th Cav., was chopped to ribbons. Enemy losses were extraordinarily high  ... a price they were willing to pay to learn the lessons that would serve  them on future battlefields.<br />The North Vietnamese did learn. They  adjusted their tactics and modernized and increased the number of rocket  propelled grenade launchers carried by infantry units. Additional heavy  machine guns and anti-aircraft weapons were laboriously brought down the Ho  Chi Minh Trail to beef up defenses in future operations. By summer 1970,  when a division of North Vietnamese soldiers surrounded airmobile troopers  of the 101st Airborne Division at Fire Support Base Ripcord, they were a  different enemy.<br />By 1970 the Vietnam War was a different war as well. In  1965 there was support forthe war at home and Moore's men went into Ia  Drang to win, and win they did. By 1970 U.S. forces were being withdrawn  and the ground war was being turned over to an increasingly capable South  Vietnamese military. At home, support for the war effort had waned terribly  and political will was lacking. U.S. units increasingly became  casualty-shy. Even so, the battle for FSB Ripcord (see Keith Nolan's  &quot;Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970&quot;) was as  complex and deadly as that at Ia Drang. But in the end, the 1st Cavalry  Division held their ground and the 101st did not. A clear sign that the war  was, for all practical purposes, over.<br />Read Moore's and Galloway's book  ... give copies to friends and relatives ... it's a classic that will stand  the test of time. Then remember the words of A. E. Houseman after the  bloody struggles of World War One: &quot;Life is nothing much to lose, but  young men think it is ... and we were young.&quot;
B00004SCX6|5.0|Granted, Britney doesn't have a great, diva-like voice like Whitney or Celine, she does have a way to get you to love the songs after listening to them. You may not like every song, but you will enjoy listening to her sing  it. She has a fairly strong voice which she uses to her advantage on high  notes, but some of her long notes are whiny. If you like music with quick  beats, get this CD!
B00000JMQE|5.0|this goes on my top fantasies with Dark Crystal, The Hobbit, Howard the Duck, The Last Unicorn, Labyrinth, Wizard of Oz, Neverending Story, City of  Lost Children, Big Trouble in little China, Terry Gilliam's Brazil,  Stargate, Legend, Who framed Roger Rabbit, Black Cauldron, and Conan. for  anyone who is a fan of these Movies should check this one out, it's very  entertaining and fun as well. it maybe too scary for little Children but  enjoy.
B00003CWTH|1.0|Although many people gave this movie 5 stars I don't even want to give it 1 star.  This was the most mixed up movie I have ever seen.  It jumped all over the place, I did not understand what was going on, it was very weird.   I have see hundreds of movies and I can usually find some good in a movie  until I seen this one, which I could not force myself to watch until the  end.
1573225517|5.0|High Fidelity is one of my favorite books. Unfortunetly, the movie came out and will probably discourage people from reading this very funny book. If you're a male in your late early 30s, this is a must read, as you will  surely releate to the main character of the book.
B000005IRG|5.0|Television's Marquee Moon is considered by many to be one of the greatest albums of all time. It is. Although it almost sounds similar to punk on the surface, especially with Tom Verlaine's vocals. This music, however, is far  too complicated to be punk music. Being a musician myself, I can fully  respect the talents of the band. Their lyric and music writing is  outstanding. That's part of what makes this album great. There other part  is the songs themselves. This album isn't just an hour of incredible guitar  work and lyrics. Songs like Marquee Moon, Torn Curtain and Friction are  epic songs that are so involving, its hard to do anything else while you  are listening to them. All eight songs on Marquee Moon are like this. This  is easily one of the all time great albums, and very essential listening to  anyone.
B000002L68|4.0|The weird backwards-sounding ending to &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; with the rain and chanting vocals is actually another &quot;song&quot;!<br />If you play this part backwards (which I did back in the 80's on my dad's  turntable - remember those?), it says:<br />&quot;Hello.  How are you?  I'm  fine, fine, 'cuz I know that the Lord is coming soon.  Coming again  soon.&quot;<br />These words are sung to a very strange tune in an erie,  almost unsettling harmony of voices.  Haunting and unforgettable!
0316777722|5.0|If you've never read David Sedaris, or heard his radio pieces (often featured on National Public Radio) then start now.  A friend of mine recommended him to me and he is one of the funniest authors I have ever  read.  He views the world from a perspective that not only have most people  never heard, they've never even conceived of it.  To some, he might seem  crude or offensive, but he is also sharp, witty and unique.  He writes  about topics that one would never expect to find an essay on, but he always  hits the nail on the head.  I recommend him to everyone, no matter what you  like to read, because there has to be an essay in here that speaks to you.
B000002TQV|5.0|Maybe the most emotionally powerful rock album of the 90s. Critics realized their mistake by not giving the band their due when this was released, so they jumped on the bandwagon for the very good, but not great,  OK Computer. The Bends is a faultless collection. The climax to the title  track makes my head spin. They will be hard-pressed to top this album for  the rest of their career. I hope they do!
B000002KBH|5.0|The thing to remember is that Garcia was, first and foremost, a bluegrass musician, so much of American Beauty, as well as his recordings with David Grisman and Old &amp; In the Way, I think, truly displayed him in his most  natural element.  A lot of &quot;heads&quot; get hung up on Jerry's hippie  image.  They overlook the fact that he absolutely idolized Bill Monroe, for  the simple and misguided reason that the two weren't exactly soul brothers  in terms of lifestyle.   At least three songs here belong in the history  books as classic musical Americana.  They are &quot;Friend Of the  Devil&quot;, &quot;Truckin'&quot;, and, one of the simplest and most  elegant songs of the era, &quot;Ripple&quot;.  I mean, how many people do  you know who can resist humming along when these are played?
6303997198|1.0|I know this is a film for women, but I also know there must be some women out there who see this for what it is: overly sentimental schmaltz to the point of ridiculousness. Meryl Streep plays the Italian-American housewife Francesca and Clint Eastwood plays the free-spirited photographer Robert. Streep spends most of the film crying. I'm not joking....there are about 5 10-minute scenes with her silently in tears to the obligatory piano/violin soundtrack. Clint does his best to act like he loves her, but it's not too convincing. And the film is framed as a flashback by Francesca's son and daughter, their badly-acted soap opera subplot and their nadir personalities nauseating this reviewer. Robert tries to get Francesca to \\"come away with me\\", but, you guessed it, she has a family to consider. Their relationship borders on pathetic. One thing I know; I wouldn't want to \\"come away with\\" the emotionally unstable Francesca.<br />Dirty Harry/Blondy does not belong in this terrible waste of film. And Sophie made the wrong Choice to lower herself to this. Then again neither of these great actors have done anything significant in the last 10 years. Another Streep film even worse than this, believe it or not, is Falling in Love with Robert Deniro with basically the same plot as Bridges.  And if you want to see a great Clint (out of control) romance see Play Misty for Me.
0553212737|3.0|If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do  not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get  between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST  ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).  <br />Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story  and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was  written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television,  or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of  us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at  times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too  subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not  derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth  Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have  read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got  Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together  each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know  when I'm going to be finished. <br />And this is coming from someone who  studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't  share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood  them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).  <br />Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and  her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be  experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However,  a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You  must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push  through some dialogue that runs longer than one page. <br />As for what the  book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)
0783228422|5.0|High Plains Drifter stands as a testament to the spirit of the art-film Western, and carries the Sergio Leone inspired existential qualities within  it.  The Stranger (Clint Eastwood) rides into a corrupt town full of  cowards, blows some of 'em away, and takes advantage of a luscious female.  I consider it a misinterpretation to call what Clint does rape.  His  character basically treats people exactly the way they deserve, and this  hot blonde in effect approached him, not vice-versa.  As Bill Curtis (who  played a munchkin in the Wizard of Oz) says, she tries to kill him because  she loved the sex, but afterwards he ignored her.<br />Ambiguities abound in  the film.  Is the Stranger the ghost of the marshall that the town had  killed?  The film implies this, hence he knows a lot more about the  townspeople then he lets on.  Also contains an impeccable understated  performance from Verna Bloom.  At the heart of all this is sweet revenge,  and the Stranger gets it good.  Ranks with The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,  Once Upon a Time in the West, and the Hired Hand as one of the all time  great Westerns.
6304383827|4.0|If you're not a Jane Austen fan, but enjoy a contemporary romance-comedy flick, this movie is a must.<br />Granted, the first few minutes are tedious: there is much information to cover to get you up to speed, and if you look  at the directing, it looks as if only one camera was used to film the  opening (there are no close ups or different angles). But hang tight.  The  fun is just beginning!<br />Paltrow plays a delightful Emma, endearing and at  the same time madening. Northam plays a wonderfully reserved but passionate  Mr. Nightly. Play close attention to the scenes when they're together,  catch his phrasing, subtle eye movements, his body language around her. He  is in pain and you can feel it! Oh, Wonderful! Just what a romance should  be.<br />As others have mentioned, Miss Bates is wonderful, as are Mr. and  Mrs. E.- I, also, found the Harriet Smith character dull, and Jane Fairfax  seemed to have stepped into the wrong movie. But all in all, for those of  you who are non-Jane-Austen-Purists, you will find yourself delightfully  surprised. <br />By the way, my brother recommended this movie to me back when  it was still in the theater. He really liked it (went with the wife). And  his favorite movie last year was The Matrix.
B00004U30D|2.0|After watching David Lynch's masterpiece A Straight Story I had the misfortune of sitting through American Beauty.  I liked Kevin Spacey's  performance, except for his idiotic monologue at the end.  This is one of  those movies that make me talk back to the screen, with insulting remarks.   Move it along, director!  Shoddy work can't be excused by inventive plot  twists.  Yes, it's politically correct to dislike the ex-marine who smacks  his kid around, collects guns, and is a hard nose, and sure it's easy to  take the cheap shot at this caricature and call him a closet queen.  You  may think this is cutting edge, but I think it's just a cheap shot at an  obvious target.  I couldn't stand the movie before most of this happened,  so my dislike goes deeper than just this.  This is just not a quality job.   The director just did a lousy job.  That's my reaction.
B000002MZ9|5.0|I've been listening to Neil's music for twenty years, and this colloboration with Pearl Jam ranks up there with Tonight's the Night, Rust Never Sleeps,Harvest MoonI and Ragged Glory.  Lyrically, Neil continues to  confront America with all of its ugliness.  &quot;Need distraction.  Need  romance and candlelight.  Need random violence. Need Entertainment  Tonight&quot; he sings on I'm the Ocean.  Truth be Known is a rueful dirge  that reminds me of &quot;Lookout Joe&quot; on the (hard to believe) 25 year  old Tonight's the Night.  Is Neil singing about a burnt out drug victim  like Bruce Berry?<br />Pearl Jam rocks just as convincingly as Crazy Horse,  and give many of the songs a nervous edge, especially on Big Green Country  and Song X.  It would of been fascinating to hear this group revitalize the  sour &quot;Time Fades Away&quot; on this album, but that is sheer  nitpicking. A must for Neil Young listeners, ancient and new.
0790720434|5.0|The Secret Garden is my all time favorite film of its genre. It's a family film, but it is not just for kids.  The story is simple enough for children to understand, yet complex enough to keep adults interested. <br />One of the aspects of the film I like best is the cinematography.  It is visually striking, and the direction was excellent.  I can't say enough about the emotions evoked by the visual excellence of this film.<br />The acting was superior, especially Kate Maberly's portrayal of Mary Lennox.  But all the actors did a superb job.  They were very believable. <br />The sound track is also superior. The haunting melody of &quot;Winter Light&quot; graced many of the outdoor scenes. Sung by Linda Ronstadt as the closing theme, it remains one of my favorite musical compositions.  The interplay of the background music with the film's stunning visual beauty makes this movie a true work of art.<br />When the movie first came out in theaters, I took my 8-year-old daughter to see it.  She liked it fine, but I fell in love with it and have been in love with the film ever since.  I'm a man in my late 40s and I'm not ashamed in the least to admit that I simply adore this enchanting family film.  From its intriguing beginning to its highly emotional end, the film is perfect.  Enough said.

But my ultimate faith in her talent paid off.  This book was heaven.  The characters were funny and irreverent. The story  was interesting and caught me up in the &quot;who&quot; in &quot;who done  it.&quot; The only problem with this novel..... it came to an end too darn  fast.

0201626632|4.0|Feibelman has done a great service for future scientists in writing this book. Although a quick read, it's dense with good advice for budding scientists, whether they be at the grad student, postdoc, or assistant  professor stage of their careers. For example, he advises against showing  an outline at the beginning of a talk because it is as superfluous as it is  ubiquitous. (See the review by Gregory McMahan for more specifics.)<br />The  only shortcoming I find with the book is its focus on high level research.  As a top scientist at a government lab, Feibelman directs his comments to  those whose aspirations are similar to his. Not all of us who do research  aspire to, or can, be tops in our field however. If you're looking for a  book that tells you how to balance teaching and research or how to survive  in different types of academic institutions, for example, a better choice  would be Tomorrow's Professor by Richard Reis. Feibelman focuses only on  the research side of the coin however.<br />Still, the book is excellent and  can be useful to anyone whose career includes scientific research. I only  wish I had found it earlier!
0800139151|1.0|This movie was awful.  I laughed occasionally at the over the top camera  work, but that was about it.  <br />I'm not sure if the creators of this movie  were attempting to film drama, action, or romance.  They failed at all  three subjects, none the less.  <br />I wish there would have been better  dialog, more devloped characters, a better plot, and better flow in the  story line.  The only character I wasn't annoyed with was that of Russel  Crowe's.  Unfortunately, they didn't give him much to work with in this  script.
6305897786|3.0|Considering the quality and variety of characters portrayed by Johnny Depp over the years, I fully expected another great performance. Unfortunately for me that was not the case. While I expected a strong script, I received a weak one. I found myself correctly guessing what was going to happen next on too many scenes. This movie did not keep me in suspense at all. Therefore, I rule it out as a suspense or a thriller. The movie trailers portrayed it as a horror film which is what I expected and wanted to see. But in the end I asked myself, &quot;What happened? Is that all? Wait a minute, there must be more.&quot; The Johnny Depp character was portrayed with a lack of emotion and complete disinterest. I felt as though Mr. Depp were in a hurry to get it over with. He did nothing whatsoever to impress me with his 2 dimensional portrayal. In several scenes he happens accross the murdered bodies of acquaintences, and has no real emotional reaction whatsoever. C'mon, Johnny! At least pretend you're upset. Jeez! In fact the only character portrayed with any real emotion and feeling was the Frank Langella character and we saw much too little of him on screen, alas. And while the movie itself was wonderfully filmed, I was left feeling empty and hollow. It was as though someone had all this extra money laying around and said, &quot;Hey Roman!&quot;(Roman Polanski) &quot;I got all this extra money laying around. How's about making a movie?&quot; The continuing &quot;buildup&quot; left me waiting for a great conclusion only to be left wondering, &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; In short I feel as though 2 hours of my life have been stolen from me. And I was left asking myself, &quot;What was the point of this movie?&quot; I had no answer. I expected more, much much more from Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski. Maybe next time guys...
B00002SWEM|3.0|Enjoy the &quot;just-okay&quot; audio of this DVD, and buy the CD for the better journey through some very moving music. The subtitles are cheap and sometimes difficult to read. The story is engaging.<br />Briefly, this DVD is  a gripping documentary of the condition of Cuba. The faded pastels on  crumbling buildings...beautiful ocean waves crashing over  seawalls...streets with huge potholes filled with water, the skyline  obscured with laundry lines. The real story here is what bad shape that  country appears to be in....
6303921248|5.0|My mom received this movie for Christmas, and I thought it would be a really boring movie . . . but one boring afternoon I decided to try it out.  I was immediately hooked.  I stayed up until 2 in the morning just to  finish it.  It is the best movie I've ever seen, and it prompted my to read  the novel.  The acting was superb, and the music is wonderful.  I ordered  the soundtrack and the book &quot;The Making of Pride and Prejudice.&quot;   I recommend this movie to anyone.  The six hours will just fly by!
6305807086|5.0|1999 was the best year in movies I can remember. granted I'm only 23 and don't have that many years to go by, but 1999 was incredible. Sixth Sense,  3 Kings, Fight Club, American Beauty, Blair Witch, etc etc. And the most  original of them all, Being John Malkovich. This movie is strange, just  plain strange.  A puppeteer (John Cusak) is working for a filing company on  the 7 1/2 floor of a building (yes, you read that right). He finds a door  that goes into the mind of John Malkovich. After 15 minutes, he's shot out  of John's head onto the side of the NJ Turnpike. Makes perfect sense right?  In order to enjoy this movie, you better check your rational thought at the  door.<br />Oh man, what a ride. This movie challenges everything we've come to  expect from cute little cookie cutter movies that come out of hollywood.  Thank god some people out there still have the courage to make something  completely different. I applaud everyone involved in the making of this  movie, you all rock.<br />The DVD is even stranger than the movie. The extras  here are bizarre at best, including a page with nothing on it. There's  isolated versions of the movies shown in the movie(strange), an interview  with the director(stranger), and a 15 minute car ride with an  &quot;extra&quot; as she rambles on and comes across as a complete  psycho(strangest).
B00004THAY|3.0|While the songwriting, playing, and production on this record are impeccable, there is something missing... soul. Where is the grit of some intense playing on this record? I know that B.B. King AND Eric Clapton can  really play and sweat, but this record sounds as if they we're sitting back  in the studio and spouting out a record with the least amount of grease as  possible.<br />Otherwise a fairly good record.
B00000294R|5.0|The beats simple but great.The ryhmes are legendary and L&quot;s delivary is brilliant. This is a hip hop classic that every true hiphop fan should own.this album is raw with thumping beats and the stellar posse cut  graveyard shift.It has to be one of the best albums i have ever  heard!
B0000256E1|5.0|in Reply to the other review, Don't hate me, the person that wrote that was totally wrong about it, the translation according to the reammstein home page... is officially You Hate Me, and it is actually about a wedding, and the rough translation is, You hate, you hate  me, you hated me to say and i did not obey.
0425152251|3.0|I found this novel to be hugely entertaining and very easy to read. Many times, people are put off by the idea of philosophy because they think that anything having to deal with it must necessarily complicated and almost  incomprehensible for the average human being. This novel helps break down  some of these barriers in a very nice way. I do think that this bool should  be taken as it is: only an INTRODUCTION to philosophy. It largely skips  many things and just gives a very slight overview of many philosophical  currents. This is an entertaining work that will surely pique the curiosity  of many young readers...it's greatest strength.
B000001GQP|5.0|Powerful, romantic, intense, decadent...all to the nth degree.  All beautifully recorded for 1968.  Will spoil you for any other version.  When I first it I wanted to cry out, &quot;how come no one told me about this  before! &quot;  Well, I'm telling you all.  'Definitive' is certainly I  word I would use.
B000005HLV|1.0|i bought this album, hoping it would live up to the hype. well if you are impressed by drums and lightning fast songs, i guess you'll like it. i mean all you hear is the drums, the guitars are horrible, the guy can't sing,  and the recording is horrible. i don't see the big deal, i think it's  because they were one of the first bands to do it. if they came out now, no  one would care. people say dimmu borgir betray black metal, oh no, a band  with talent, that's not black metal. but no one says mayhem did, but  helhammer is in kovenant, with who else but members of, dare i say dimmu  borgir. look at the new album anyway, it's almost as bad as this one. all  it is is a bunch of guys, (one who looks like snoop doggy dogg) ranting on  and on about satan. they are no different than chrisrian groups that rant  on and on about god.
B00003CWTI|5.0|P.T. Anderson, has, to put it bluntly, changed my life.  He changed my life by making this exquisite, beautiful epic of eleven interwoven, powerful, and stunning characters.  When I first saw this film, for the  first time in my life, I felt compelled to sit though all of the credits  becuase it was so spectacular!  <br />People have said enough already about  the plot line, so I'll skip that.  What I will speak about though are the  characters.  Many say what makes a film good is if the characters are  larger than life.  I now and forever disagree.  What made this film so  exceptional was that the characters ARE life.  Every single one of them  thinks they are invincible.  They all have pain and suffering in the lives.   They all experience emotion that we, the audience, as normal people,  relate to becuase we feel the same emotions.  For instance, when we are  confronted that someone we love is dying, we torture ourselves with grief.   When we have a dark past, we lie to protect ourselves from pain.  When we  are alone, we feel lonely.<br />Magnolia, though only nominated for three and  won no Oscars, is something that can't easily be awarded because to us, it  hits too close to home and we hate to face the realities of death,  loneliness, addiction, and love.  Certainly this film deserved many Oscars  (Cruise especially because I usually despise him as an actor)--Melora  Walters was so honest as Claudia.  Jason Robards proved that even as a  bedridden old fart we still have regret and issues to face.  Julianne Moore  (my favorite actress) proved once again that she can take on any role given  her (this is probably my favorite performance from her).  And P.T.A.--What  is there to say about P.T.A.?  He is surely one of the most honest and  controversial filmmakers today, and I can only hope that his career  blossoms with Magnolia, definitely his best film to date. <br />P.T.A. has  courage to show us what life is, and for that he should be commended.  He  admits tohis sources of inspiration (i.e. Altman especially), and you can  tell by the outcome of Magnolia, Boogie Nights, and Hard Eight that he is  not going to settle for anything less than the truth.  For that, as well,  he should be commended.  It is now my goal to make films, because of the  beauty of this one, and Magnolia is surely not only my favorite film, but  also the one closest to my heart.

0767903854|3.0|Bill Bryson, In a Sunburned Country (Broadway, 2000)<br /> availability: it's on the bestseller list innit?<br /><br />I originally encountered the writing of Bill Bryson in a small article he wrote for National Geographic  on the Orkney Islands a year or so ago. By the time I had finished the  article, I was (and still am, to an extent) seriously considering  relocating to the Orkney Islands. Well, I've now finished In a Sunburned  Country, Bryson's travelogue of Australia-- and I never, ever want to go  there.<br /><br />Bryson gives us the world's forgotten continent (really, how  many of you who don't live there can name Australia's Prime Minister?),  mixing personal experience, history, and bewilderment in roughly equal  doses. While the history does bog down in places, I found myself--  especially in the book's first section-- glad that I was the only person in  the room while reading it, since I might well have been committed  involuntarily for laughing so hard in stretches. The most disturbing thing  is that I was laughing about the sheer number of things in Australia which  are capable of killing human beings. This is not a place you should go if  you fear death. &quot;The sea snakes are especially unnerving, not because  they are aggressive, but because they are inquisitive. Stray into their  territory and they'll come to check you out, all but rubbing against you in  the manner of cats seeking affection. They are the most sweet-tempered  creatures in existence. But cross them or alarm them and they can hit you  with enough venom to kill three grown men.&quot; Not only will the  unfriendly creatures kill you, the friendly ones will as well!<br /><br />Those  who have read more Bryson than I have hastened to say that this is a less  humorous book than his others. I'm not sure I could stand the others, for I  might die of asphyxia before reaching the end of chapter one. This is good  stuff, funny most of the time, sobering on rare occasions, and always  edifying. And don't be concerned if you forget three quarters of what's in  here by the time you're finished, including the name of Australia's present  prime minister (or the name of the silicon-tipped grass I've been wracking  my brain for for a week now). According to Bryson, there's something about  Australia that causes people to forget it exists, so as long as you  remember there are seven continents on this planet, you're ahead of the  game. ***ng. And don't be concerned if you forget three quarters of what's in  here by the time you're finished, including the name of Australia's present  prime minister (or the name of the silicon-tipped grass I've been wracking  my brain for for a week now).

0060920084|3.0|Yes, this is a funny book.  Bill Bryson is funny, but his editors give him too much leeway.  If you want to write about small town America then get off the Interstate Highways!  And when you do get off the highway do not be  surprised if staying in a motel with a superior attitude does not cause  each town to open its secrets to you and invite you in.  Fact of the matter  is, the reason he comes across so many surly people in his travels in  America or England is probably because most everyone he meets doesn't like  him.  It was with amazement that I read his &quot;revelations&quot; about  how the interstate highways are all the same.  Well, duuuh!  I think with  even the smallest foresight one would realize this and a good editor very  quickly would say &quot;Uh Bill, can you get off I95 sometime?&quot; part  way through his trip.  If you want a true travel story about a funny guy  travelling through small town America, read &quot;Out West&quot; by Dayton  Duncan - small town America is still out there.
6305627347|5.0|This was a great movie!  It's one of my favorites.<br />It starts out with Stan rounding up Kenny, Kyle, and Cartman to go see the Terrance and  Phillip Movie, but can't get in because it was rated R. then they pay a bum  to get them in and the movie teaches them to swear a lot.  All of the kids  in South Park (and most in america) see it and Kyle's mom rounds up all the  mothers in South Park and they all arrest Terrance and Phillip for  corrupting america's youth.  this leads to war between the U.S. and Canada.   Kenny does die in it and they still show him throughout the  movie.<br />Anyone who loves South Park or is just into twisted humor should  get this movie.  The price is right!  I have the movie but not the  soundtrack.  The soundtrack looks good and I will eventually get it.  But  just buy the movie!
630562285X|1.0|i can't believe all the positive reviews people have written, possibly the original producers of the movie.  besides the fact that zeta-jones is the worst actress i have ever seen, not to mention a low-class welsh beauty  whose fame has faded away already, the plot is predictable and ridiculous.   the scene where we have to watch her walking thru the laser security was  excruciatingly boring, in the meantime old connery is drolling on himself  and groaning.  not to mention the ending where they end up together, my  god, it was unbelieveably bad.  i'm a big james bond fan and wanted to like  this movie, but it really insulted my intelligence.  please save yourself  time and money and skip this one.
3822884979|5.0|&quot;Most of the art work displayed in this book,&quot;The Great American Pin-Up&quot;, is that of some of the best influential pin-up artists of our time. I believe that the creativity (then) is what makes the impact on what  great pin-up art was (and still is) all about. From my point of view as a  pin-up artist myself, that Vargas, Petty, Elvgreen, and so many others, are  the reasons for my influence on the way I draw and paint the female form. I  think that is how pin-up art should always be appreciated, respected and  remembered even in the way of today's standards.&quot;  Peace, Jon Hul
B00003CX7L|5.0|I love the way the Disney Co. writes their movies.  Kids love them and think they are funny, but there is a lot of adult humor in most of them as  well.  Toy Story 2 is a good example.  It's a fun movie for  &quot;children&quot; of all ages.
B0000060NF|5.0|I bought this when it was originally released on vinyl and have had to replace it so many time as people (so called friends) have borrowed it and not returned it.  MPG was way before his time in Mercy Mercy Me. The range  of his voice is so vast and instantly recognisable, his spirit lives on in  his music and in my heart.
B00003CWL6|2.0|An odd &amp; terribly depressing movie whose only consolation is the unreality of the characters. The lovable drug dealer was a particularly  unreal Hollywood creation.  Do you have neighbors like this?  Move.
B0000074CU|4.0|Taste were better than even Rory Gallagher's die hard fans credit them. Maybe the rhythm section wasn't always able to stay with Gallagher's blues fancies, but when they had it locked in they were capable of some subtly  incendiary music. It earned them the opening spot for Cream's farewell gig  at the Royal Albert Hall, London, and by the sound of what they were caught  doing here, for the most part they deserved it.
0671034065|1.0|By the time I'd finished the first nine chapters, I had it with the crude characters. Perhaps some will find the humor laugh-out-loud funny, but I prefer humor that is more intellectually appealing and I want characters  worthy of my sympathy. Unfortunately, this book provided neither. What it  did provide was the premise that &quot;crude is cute.&quot; <br />This was the  first book I'd tried by Linda Howard. Most likely, it will be the last.
B00000331V|4.0|Well, it ain't &quot;Full House&quot;. (What IS, might we ask?) But it's still as incendiary as R and B got in the mid-1970s. And compared to this, all the other big-selling live albums of that usually sorry decade just  shrink to dust and slink away in shame. I mean, these guys made the likes  of Lynyrd Skynyrd, Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band, and the rest seem  like run-through rehearsals. This isn't exactly the cream of the J. Geils  repertoire (you're going to line up &quot;Detroit Breakdown&quot; against  &quot;First I Look At The Purse&quot; or &quot;Whammer Jammer&quot;?), but  you still wouldn't trade one cut from this one for every last riff of  &quot;One More From The Road&quot;.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is the most Pearl Jam album that Pearl Jam have released yet. With music and lyrics written by every member of the quintet, we finally have a complete effort from one of the most talented bands of the 90's. While not  as &quot;hard&quot; as some earlier albums, Yield breaks out on occasion,  but at the same time, very easily can slow down, and simply flow from note  to note, word to word, song to song.
031286504X|5.0|Rarely do I pay attention to the fanfare on a books cover, but Dean Koontz is right on the money calling I Am Legend &quot;the most clever and riveting vampire novel since Dracula.&quot;  A scientific twist on the  vampire myth, with a great ending.  Read this and you'll see why Matheson  is the well from which so much modern horror flows.  Matheson makes you  feel like you're the last normal person in a world overrun with vampires.  I don't know what was the bigger reason in my tearing through this in one  night...the page-turning suspense or me looking for an excuse to not turn  out the lights that night!  Also check out the short stories &quot;The Near  Departed,&quot; two-and-a-half pages that will cut you like a razor's edge,  &quot;The Funeral,&quot; a comic twist on the vampire genre, and  &quot;Prey,&quot; basis for the terrifying tiki doll with a vengeance story  from the old &quot;Trilogy of Terror&quot; movie (I had almost gotten over  my phobia of tiki dolls that movie gave me until I read this!).
B00004T8RK|5.0|Continuing their evolution from Yield, the band puts out another album that brings us ever closer to the true Pearl Jam. With contributions from every member this time out, the listener gets to see and feel what the  lyricist was thinking at the inception of the song. With the near perfect  mix of rockers, ballads, and mid-tempo grooves, Binaural is one of those  rare cd's that you can put on and not have to worry about skipping the  occasional lemon. For the true beauty of this record, listen with two ears.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby outdid himself with this one!  He shines! This album has the most eclectic assortment of music I have heard from one artist in a long time! This also shows how versitle Moby can be! This is a must have! Rock On!
B0000027RL|5.0|This is one of those rare &quot;must own&quot; records. Nearly every song is an anthem that will take you back to the early 90's. Eddie Vedder sings with an unbelievable amount of emotion and conviction, while Stone Gossard  shines with some of the most memorable riffs of the decade. While not as  complete as some of their later work, this record is just plain great to  listen to.
6305892946|3.0|When I went to see this in the theater, I was all hyped up! I was so excited to see what the ending was going to be like. What a dissapointment!  There is still a few good scares and jumps here and there but no surprise!  Kill this one, kill that one. Blah blah blah. I was hoping something  irrational was going to happen! Oh well, Still 3 stars for me.
0425104052|4.0|The book is what I would call an intriguing tease.  Doyle creates a mood throughout the whole book that keeps the reader sitting on the edge of their seat.  I would definitely recommend this book for those readers who  like a good mystery.
B00000JCOV|1.0|What the hell is the matter with you people?Did Daddy not play with you when you was a little boy.Why so angry?Someone would have to be pretty mad to spend 15 dollars of someones hard earned cash on this.What the hell?
0808511122|3.0|This book by Von Daniken is certainly fascinating to read.<br />This book is mainly about the existence of other creatures besides human beings. I can say that the author was able to present certain ideas that will certainly  make you think and say: &quot;Oh yeah! Why didn't I think of that?&quot;  The pictures inlcuded in the book also helped prove his theories.<br />One  part that really made me think was about the Great Pyramids of Egypt. He  questioned how the people from way back were able to build those pyramids  and stack them one by one in a perfectly shaped triangle when they have no  tools or whatsoever that they can use to build those great structures.<br />On  the last part of the &quot;novel,&quot; Von Daniken began doubting the  existence of God. This made me react a little because I believe that no  person can or should doubt the existence of the Lord. This was the main  reason why some people from about a decade ago began talking about the  book. This is the reason why I only rated this book 3 stars. On the other  hand, this book was really entertaining and will surely make your minds  work.
B000002HRE|4.0|This was the album that did it for me.It made me appreciate truly one of the best rock bands of the 20th century.From the moment I heard &quot;The Memory Remains, I could hardly wait to get to the record store and pick it  up.Every song on this one is good and &quot;The Memory Remains&quot;,  &quot;Unforgiven 2&quot; and &quot;Fuel&quot; border on great.Now, I have a  bone to pick with some of you so-called &quot;die hard,  Metallica-used-to-rock-until-the-black-album-when-they-sold-out-but-Master-of-Puppets-still-rules!&quot;people.I  am sick and tired of ignorant 30 and 40 year olds who are stuck in the  80's.A place in time when music was arguabley at its worst (with the  exception of Metallica and a few others).Its funny how fans like me, who  first bought Load and Reload, like ALL of Metalica albums while you guys  want to live in the past remembering a time that no longer exists.I hate to  rain on your parade guys but Metallica makes music for no one else but  Metallica.They are 35 and 40 year old men who have grown up and broadened  their music.With every album they have stretched sonic boundries that they  havn't before.Metallica has grown up and I suggest you  40 year old  headbangers do likewise.
080018789X|3.0|Whilst half an hour too long, this is a romantic comedy of the sort that  went out of fashion in the 1950s (in which Cruise's role would have been  played by Cary Grant). The story is pure formula, with nothing to surprise  or shock the viewer. The plus points are the quality of playing by the  entire cast and the well-observed moments of comedy and pathos. Cruise and  Zellweger work well together, and Gooding Jnr provides likable support.  Nothing to write home about, but engaging enough in its own way.
B00003CX95|5.0|Braveheart is not a documentary and was never intended to be.  It is about myth and legend.  It is an epic that uses a historical background to tell  us a story about the struggle for freedom against oppression and tyranny  that is just as important today as it was in Scotland in the Middle  Ages.<br />People who are hung up on the minutae of historical accuracy are  missing the story that the storyteller is trying to tell.  Great epics use  history as a background to tell an engrossing tale.   This is a tradition  that dates back to the Iliad and beyond.  Hollywood didn't just invent  this.  <br />The story of William Wallace is perfect for this type of  storytelling.  Wallace himself is something of a mystery to historians and  most historical knowledge of him is based on narrative poems and tales told  through the generations.  There really isn't that much that historians know  about him other than that he was a violent and charismatic leader who led  Scotland to a great victory over England in the battle of Sterling Bridge  and was eventually executed in London.  Most of Wallace's  &quot;history&quot; is based primarily on speculation and studying the  legends about him that have been passed down through time. <br />This is  fertile ground for a writer and filmmaker to use a broad brush to paint a  picture of Wallace and his life and times.  And Randall Wallace and Mel  Gibson did this brilliantly in Braveheart.  Just enjoy the film and the  story that it tells and don't get hung up on whether or not every detail is  historically accurate.

B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is possibly the sweetest album ever made by a group.  This is one of the few albums I can put in and listen to more than one song.  Dookie has 9 or 10 songs that are great to listen.  Even the tracks that are not  my favorite are ok to listen to.  If you only buy one green day album this  should be it.
0451193881|5.0|this is a great book! if you are into horror books, this is the ultimite one!  you cannot put the book down once you start to read it your so scared! it has a great storry plot.
B000001DTM|5.0|Okay, so I can see how, if you were captivated in the '80's by the soft sound of The Joshua Tree and the earnest politics of the band, this album could throw you for a loop.  Equally, if you were put off by U2's explosion  into the mainstream, you might be sceptical.  On the other hand, if you  have an open mind and a desire for an album that is worth listening to the  whole way through, Achtung Baby is more than worth the price of admission,  so to speak. This was NOT the beginning of the end, the sellout, as some  critics might have you believe.  The 'sturm und klang' industrial intro to  'Zoo Station' (my personal fav) is only the beginning of an album that has  MORE heart and soul in its lyrics (if that's possible) than its predessors.   I admire U2 for the exact thing that they are often derided for: their  willingness and ambition to change.  Sure, they could have made three more  Joshua Trees, been successful perhaps, but they wouldn't have been creative  and people wouldn't have liked them any more for it.  I enjoy Achtung Baby  and Joshua Tree equally, for the reason that they are about GOOD MUSIC, not  following the leader.
B00000DMJF|5.0|A great piece if you like forgettable tunes in the vein of Savoy Truffle, Wild Honey Pie, Good Night, and on, and on... (this record is &quot;Long, Long, Long).  The only salvagable song (USSR) has an admitted Beach Boys  flair to it.  But, since the cover says &quot;Beatles&quot;, I give it five  stars, like everyone else on this page.
B00002ND77|5.0|Spike Lee's malcolm X in my opinion is one of the great fil Bio pictures  of the 90's. It's easily Spike Lee's most ambitious effort to date. The  film scope is expansive. The story ranges from the streets of Boston to the  city of Mecca. The films look is very rich, with vibrant colors and sets.  The cinematography is excellent as usual from Ernest Dickerson who goes  into his usual bag of visual tricks. Malcolm X has a look that's all of  it's own. It has the look and polish of a big studio movie. There's even a  dance number that's a sight to see. The cast is impeccable.  Stand Out  performances go out to all of the cast. Al Freeman Jr. is a virtual clone  Elijah Muhammad. His role should have at least earned a nomination for best  supporting actor. Delro Lindo also stands out as the wicked number runner  West Indian Archie. Angela Basset providesample support as Betty Shabazz.  And Albert Hall is splendid as the ficitious Baines. Hey even spike lee has  his moments althought I think he should've skipped out on this shot. But  the real star of this movie is Denzel Washington. His performance simply  breathtaking. He is Malcolm X. He utterly becomes him down to his  mannerisms ,speech patterns, he even look more than a little bit like him.  I think this was his best on screen  performance that should have earned  him an Oscar. Talk about robbery. His performance simply towers above the  rest of the cast. <br />In a fair world this movie should've won  at least  three or four oscars. But unfortunately many in the hollywood community  refused to give Malcolm X a fair deal. So unfortunately the movie (with the  exception of best actor and best costume design) was virtually shut out of  the Oscars. Politics.<br />Arguably Spike lee's best film, although Do the  right thing is very close. It's a wonderful sprawling oddesey of the life  of one of the most influential Black leaders of the 20th century.
B00000J7J4|4.0|A little something for everyone.  It was a nice balance of Carlos and his guest artists.  The Lauryn Hill track is one that radio slept on, but is a tight track.  I also like &quot;Maria, Maria&quot; despite the fact that  radio tried to play the hell out it.
630575067X|2.0|After all the reviews on this one, I won't spend much time with it.  Here it is:  (1)What a waste of Liam Neeson's talent!  I know nothing about his character.  (2)Darth Maul was pretty worthless as the villain.  Other than  one incredible fight sequence he did nothing to impress.  (3)The pod race  that people seem to think is so great is straight out of Ben Hur.  (4)That  Jar-Jar Binks annoyed me throughout the movie and apparently will be around  for the next one.  That should keep me away from there!  I wouldn't give  this one any stars at all if it weren't for the special effects which are  very well done.  But I don't watch movies for special effects.  I watch  them for entertainment.  And this one mostly just annoys.
B000005S31|5.0|It's interesting to think that this is the album that Lou Reed made directly following &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;. He must've really gotten something out of his system, because &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot; still stands as one of his most beautiful achievements. Reed has rarely seemed so genuinely interested in having his voice and spirit heard as clearly as he does on this outstanding statement of renewal.<br />The songs are all first-rate, from the sublime title cut to the harrowing imagery of &quot;Kicks&quot;. Reed's signature lyrical touches abound, even on the sunnier songs, like &quot;Charley's Girl&quot; (&quot;I said 'If I ever see Sharon again/I'm gonna punch her face in'&quot;) and &quot;Crazy Feeling&quot; (&quot;And you, you really are a queen/And I know 'cause I've made the same scene&quot;). &quot;She's My Best Friend&quot; - a leftover from the Velvet Underground days - is totally at home on this disc, which Lester Bangs once jokingly referred to as &quot;Lou, the Moonlight and You&quot;.<br />That wouldn't have been such a bad title, actually. The tender side of one of rock's greatest voices is the focus, with Reed delivering possibly his best vocal performance ever. With its spare, understated arrangements that give his musings the necessary room to breathe, &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot; is a real jewel in Reed's catalogue.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is one of the better blues albums I've heard in a long time. EC plays and sings on the left channel, while B.B. is doing his thang on the right channel. Makes for an interesting mix! Niether artist tries to out-do the  other, which is refreshing , considering the fame and fortune of each.  <br />Best tracks, in my opinion, are &quot;Worried Life Blues&quot;,  &quot;When My Heart Beats Like A Hammer&quot;, the title track, and  &quot;Ten Long Years&quot;. The other tracks are fine as well.<br />But this  tape, CD, or Vinyl. It's definitely worth the price of  admision! <br />&quot;When you get up in the mornin', I want you say  BLUES!&quot;   -Son Seals.
0671034065|4.0|Great quick read... I've read every Howard book out there and was very pleased to see her go back to her original writing style.  Interaction between her main characters has always been the important ingredient in her  early books and she doesn't dissapoint here.  Let's see more like this in  the future.
B00004U45G|5.0|An excellent live album that lives up to it's expectations. With the addition of the Black Crow's guitar foundation, Jimmy Page was able to faithfully reproduce several Classic Zep tunes in a live venue. Many cuts  from Physical Graffiti are difficult to reproduce live due to the fact that  Page used so much over dubbing in the original recordings. A live  performance was impossible... until now.<br />The Black Crows add a fresh raw  sound that could never be accomplished by any session player attempting to  simply back up Page. It was a match made in guitar heaven. Although the  recent Page/Plant work is an art work in it's own right, the Page/Crows  work was a necessity to express the rich and warm soul that exist in the  early Zep Rock/blues work.
B00000JCOV|5.0|IVE HAD THIS CD FOR OVER A YEAR.  WHEN I GOT IT ALL MY FRIENDS NEVER HEARD OF THEM.  NOW THEY ARE ALL SLIPKNOT FANS.  WHATS NOT TO WORSHIP?  GREATEST MUSIC  AND STAGE SHOW AND COSTUMES!   I HAVE ABOUT 50 HARDCORE CDS AND THIS  IS THE BEST.  CLOSEST TO THIS IS SOULFLY.  SERIOUSLY THIS CD IS SO  GREAT.   THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN NOT LIKE IT , UNLESS YOU ARE INTO 80S ROCK WHICH I  DESPISE.  GO OUT AND BUY IT!
6305126062|3.0|Thsi movie was okay, but that's about it.  It was SO long(almost three hours), and it has to be a pretty good movie to get away with that length, and the Horse Whisperer just wasn't there.  I love horses, and I love  romantic movies, but the plot just moved too slow for me and the ending  just isn't very conclusive.  They never tell us if Grace's mom and Tom  Booker end up together or if they decide to stay away from each other, and  that really bothered me.  Some people really loved this movie and I  understand how, but I just didn't like it that much.
0783241542|4.0|I thought American Pie was very funny, had just enough sex jokes, and had good actors, but eventually, it got tiring. Even though the jokes were  funny, after a while they just kept coming in no order at all. After about  40 minutes, it seemed like the movie was trying NOT to entertain, but test  the audience, and see how much raunchyness they can take. Although most of  the movie was jokes, and not events or plot, the ending and actual events  that weren't one big joke, were very entaining, and never dull. I recommend  this movie to people who like raunchy jokes, and don't need a plot  throughout the movie. In that way, it's sorta similar to Scary Movie, which  is MUCH funnier.
B0000256KE|5.0|It wasn't until Roxy released their next album -- Stranded -- that we fully realised what a masterpiece 'For Your Pleasure' was.  Nor did we appreciate how important Eno was until he had left.  I would disagree with  some of the comments made by other reviewers of this album, in that it is  the long tracks of what was side 2 of the LP -- Bogus Man and For Your  Pleasure --  which showed what the band was capable of creating, when given  the space.  There are some short, catchy numbers on side 1 -- ie Do the  Strand and Editions of You -- but in the end, these can pall.  Ferry wrote  weird lyrics and played a mean piano -- most of the piano on Stranded is  his -- but I don't believe he wrote many strong melodies.  Increasingly  Ferry would do cover versions of songs by stronger writers for his solo  albums and subsequent albums by the reformed Roxy.  Appreciating Roxy was  all about their arrangements, their camp weirdness, and the perpetual  enigma over why they could never retain a bass player for more than a  couple of records.  When Bob Harris introduced Roxy on the UK's &quot;Old  Grey Whistle Test&quot; TV show at the time of this album's release, he  said something like &quot;Now this is a band I really hate.&quot;  He just  didn't understand.
B00002Z88D|2.0|It is true, someone may have noted this before, but the berkeley community thearter is on Berkeley High's campus. I know I was their, they took over half are school for nearly all of april '99. Was not to much of a hit with  the students, though jerks to us and their is not to much of a metal  community at BHS, most students are rap fans ( I am not)

6303212263|5.0|Why don't they make movies like this anymore? I recently saw this film on  AMC in it's letterbox format. Everything is just about perfect. The  casting, the story, and the characters. The special effects hold up  extremely well today(the destruction of California for example). However,  two things really stands out in this film. It has a sense of wonder and  spirit. The movie actually has quite a few moving movements(Superman's  failure to save Lois in time and his reaction to his failure is very  heartbreaking). All this and the impeccable Christopher Reeve, quite  possibly the best Superman ever. His looks and performance as Clark Kent  got him the part, but as Superman, nobody can come close(Dean Cain of Lois  and Clark is number two on the list). Richard Donner's(Lethal Weapon  movies, Ladyhawke) best film. Watch, and you will believe a man can fly.
0393317552|4.0|Overall a fine book; well worth reading.  I learned more about the history of man from 500,000BC to 4000 BC in this book than in the rest of my life put together.  The overwhelming global perspective this book makes it even  more valuable.  Truly a fine description of many of the core formative  elements of society.  <br />The books bends over backward to avoid any taint  of racism.  However, Mr. Diamond oversteps his bounds when he claims that  he has resolved all issues that deal with how racism arises.  I wish that  these issues were as easily resolved.  The older deeper issues that arise  before the foundation of human society still exist.  And Mr. Diamond's smug  self importance taints an otherwise fine book.
6300268993|4.0|Not as spellbinding as Superman 1(but pretty darn close),this is  nontheless a very entertaining film. The fight in Metropolis is about as  good as the filmmakers could do considering the technology of the time. The  tide of battle recedes constantly, with Superman's experience of his powers  and the need to protect the citizens of Metropolis against the ruthless  zeal of the three villains. The most jaw dropping part of the battle is  where Non and Superman go at each other in the sewers. In tis scene they  show only the street view, with only loud punch sound effects and quaking  citizens and street. Very exciting. However the most moving part of the  movie is when the villains throw a bus at Superman. He doesn't emerge for a  while, and the citizens of Metropolis, believing Superman dead, start to  charge the supervillains as an act of revenge. How many superhero movies  have scenes like that? The Kryptonians are perfectly cast, and Christopher  Reeve, as everybody has surely heard by now, is the only Superman.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is really one of the best box-sets of Greatest Hits of any group ... hey, it's QUEEN! <br />From the heartbreaking melodramic songs like &quot;Save Me&quot; and &quot;Who Wants To Live Forever&quot;, the great  pop songs like &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;, great R&amp;B like &quot;Another  One Bites The Dust&quot; and to the fist-pumping rock songs like  &quot;Hammer To Fall&quot;, &quot;Now I'm Here&quot; and &quot;I Want It  All&quot;, this is really an album to get in your collection, wheater  you're a fan of Queen or not.  I'm just sad that &quot;Tear It Up&quot;  wasn't put on the album as well.<br />BUY BUY BUY
6305558167|5.0|Although now a bit dated, this movie continues to impress. The imagery and  cinematography, classic strengths of John Boorman, are spectacular --  ranging from the dark and gory battle of human conflict to the lush beauty  of nature. Added to this rich visual feast is an excellent score of  classical music. This is one of the most nicely shot films you will  experience.<br />Nicol Williamson's portrayal of Merlin was critically  acclaimed, and was my first introduction to this versatile actor. Helen  Mirren gives her usual strong performance. (There is also a short  appearance by Patrick Stewart of Star Trek fame, if you care to track those  kinds of things.)<br />The story is full of symbolism of mans' struggle to  balance nature against progress, wrapped up in Arthur's relationship to  &quot;the Land&quot; via Excalibur. While many will find the symbolism and  imagery tiresome (again, manifest in most Boorman films), I found it to  bring depth to the overdone and overplayed Arthurian legend.<br />Warning: the  gore factor is fairly high.
0140067477|1.0|Somebody has to bash this book and I guess it's going to be me.  Now get this straight before I saw anything: I like Pooh and I like Taoism.  I don't attack the subject matter of this book.  However, I attack the style,  misrepresentation of religions (other than Taoism), and the  misrepresentation of Pooh in this book.<br />Although I can see this book was  intended for young adults, I find the style condescending, as if Hoff  thinks he's speaking to the uneducated masses waiting for enlightenment.   There is definitely the feel of being taught by a teacher in elementary  school as one reads this book.  Furthermore, while some might find the  childishness of Hoff &quot;delightful&quot;, I found it nothing of the  sort.  I thought the book was boring and tedious.  I don't know why people  enjoy this book when there are real philosophy books out there, like the  wonderful &quot;Zen and Art of Motorcyle Maintenence&quot;.<br />Most  disturbing about this book was its misrepresentation of other religions and  its general condemnation of non-Taoist thought.  For a young-adults book,  I've never seen pages so loaded with mind-narrowing prejudice!  His  treatment of Buddhism and Confucianism are ludicrous and disturbingly  inaccurate.  I'll leave it to the reader to find the obvious discrepencies  between Hoff's imaginary philosophies and the real philosophies he attempts  to describe.  Further, I've never felt so insulted by a book as this; his  virtually says that all scholars are fools.  Does everyone passively accept  that being enlightened requires ignorance?  I sure as heck  don't!<br />Finally, Pooh was the unfortunate mascot Hoff manipulated to give  credibility to his views.  Hoff would ask a question to Pooh and Pooh would  respond by condemning certain schools of thought.  The real Pooh would  never do that!  Pooh is a simple and non-offensive character who gets along  with the world because of both of these qualities.  In short, I was morally  offended by thisbook many consider to be a classic, and I think Hoff  should have learned some lessons from childrens' books with good messages  before he wrote this loaded polemic.
6305531412|4.0|Zemeckis hybridized the too-adult world of Ralph Bakshi and the  too-juvenile world of Looney Toons and make Roger Rabbit &quot;just  right&quot;. Mixing the cartoon zanyness of classic Disney and Looney Toons  shorts with the film noir hard-drinking detective and the very adult  Jessica Rabbit was a brilliant idea.<br />Although I started to find Roger  Rabbit's constant hyperactivity a bit annoying by the end of the movie,  they kept his endearing traits strong enough that I was happy that the  fatal &quot;dip&quot; was not to be. At the same time, half the thrill of  the movie was to see the juxtaposition of the Disney and Warner Brothers  cartoon characters (all contractually paired up and given equal time), as  well as the insider jokes spread through the movie.<br />The movie was  considered groundbreaking in its mixture of live action and cartoons.  Although it was not by any means the first, the level of quality was very  high.<br />This movie was on the leading edge of a wave of animation, wherein  animation became popular again. As a consequence, much of the terrible  low-quality Saturday morning animation of the 70's and 80's suddenly had a  higher bar to reach. Toons became decent again!<br />Like a great Disney  movie, Roger Rabbit works for both young and old audiences. The very young  may find some of the violence intense, and their guardians may have some  discomfort explaining Jessica Rabbit's anatomy, but otherwise age 9 and  above is probably fine.
B00000JCOV|3.0|This album is pretty curious because everyone has a curiosity to hear it, and I don't blame them.  It's got excellent drumming, and the sampler is great.  However, this album gets old.  Everyone calls it to be so raw, so  emotional.  Please, give me a break.  And what's with the calling Slipknot  to be metal? these guys are as metal as Blink 182.  If you want some real  heavy metal, get yourself some Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Pantera, Iron  Maiden, Slayer, Sepultura, Mercyful Fate, Morbid Angel, and 80s Metallica.   If you're looking for metal, don't go looking on this cd.  Still good, but  not metal.
6305603847|5.0|This may sound strange, but this is a film best viewed alone while you are  depressed.<br />Why?<br />Because you will walk away feeling better. Pink, now  he's a really messed up fellow.<br />The music and animation in this movie are  powerful and touching. This is all about society and its impact on humanity  -- as it becomes larger, each human becomes smaller. This can have even  greater effect on those who see themselves as sacrificial victims of  society (in Pink's case because he lost his father, his socially-opressive  schooling, and his pandering to the masses of fans).<br />The Wall, of course,  is Pink's self-defense mechanism, a way of keeping other outside. It has  since become a symbol of the Berlin Wall, which is pretty ironic.
6304609825|5.0|Sleeping Beauty has been one of my favorite movies ever since I was a  child.  Mary Costa makes a perfect Princess Aurora.  And how could you not  adore Prince Phillip he is the epitome of what a Prince should be.  He took  chivalry to new heights.  Maleficant was a perfect witch, and the three  good faires were of coure good and loveable.  Overall it is a great film  and I highly suggest it to anyone.
0385484518|4.0|Morrie wanted to share his upbeat philosophy of life and how that should carry over in his death.  If he were alive today, he clearly would be staggered by the number of people who took the time to listen.<br />I bought  this book two years ago based on great reviews but couldn't get excited  about reading a book about death.  I even skipped the movie.  But after  finally picking it up, I throughly enjoyed the quick, insightful read that  makes everyone re-examine their life's values, including me.<br />Morrie was  clearly an exceptional human being.  We've all had great teachers but this  guy was the ultimate with the joy and love he took in his craft.  Mitch  Albom is a typical American caught in the American dream without realizing  there is a problem.  I applaud Mitch for writing this book and softly  admitting some of his past sins.  My only complaint is that I wish Mitch  had been able to more definitely conclude the issues he may or may not have  with his brother.<br />But this is Morrie's book.  I spent the next day trying  to recall if I had met anyone quite like him.  It's difficult to live up to  the high standards he sets.  An excellent read and excellent lessons we  should all remember.
B00004U2GH|5.0|Johnny Cash recently released a box set titled God Love Murder.  These themes are all represented on this masterful reissue of his only number one album on the pop charts.  He touches on God with &quot;Peace In The  Valley&quot; &amp; &quot;He Turned Water Into Wine&quot;, Love on  &quot;Darlin' Companion&quot;, &quot;Ring Of Fire&quot; &amp; &quot;I Walk  The Line&quot; &amp; Murder on &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; &amp;  &quot;Wanted Man&quot;.  He is not confined to these themes, but they  permeate his music. It always seemed appropriate that Mr. Cash played San  Quentin.  The prison was known  as &quot;The Rock&quot; and he is the rock  of country music.  He is unwavering in his beliefs and his albums are as  solid as a piece of granite.  Besides the great music, this release is a  must for any fan as it contains all 17 songs played at the show compared to  the mere 9 on the original release.
1572522232|5.0|Suspiria is not only a scary witch´s tale, it´s a beautiful movie with an excellent script, surprising photography, great musical score and a stylish  director like Dario Argento.<br />The acting is amazing too, Jessica Harper,  Miguel Bosé and the rest of the european cast are incredible in this  movie.<br />If you have like me an horror movies collection, don't think  twice, buy right now this video.
B00004RFFM|5.0|i loved this movie.  i have never seen jaws, but this is probably as good.  i first saw it in the theater and have never in my entire life been on the  edge of my seat more.  once it gets going it is one very long action scene  that never lets up to let you catch your breath.  it is great.
6302878527|5.0|While Audrey Hepburn gets almost the credit she deserves, Albert Finney and directory Stanely Donen are virtualy ignored by today's public. This  movie is an excellent representation of their talents. Donen's movies are  very well remember (think &quot;Funny Face&quot; or Fred Astaire dancing on  the ceiling in &quot;Royal Wedding&quot; or Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn  in the chase scene from &quot;Charade&quot;) but his best movie, &quot;Two  for the Road&quot; was very much ahead of it's time. This is not your  typical Hepburn movie- it's not light or comedic (&quot;Sabrina&quot;  &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; &quot;Funny Face&quot;) nor is it very dramatic  (&quot;Wait Until Dark&quot; &quot;The Nun's Story&quot;), but a great  balance of both. Witty and charming. One of my favorite movies of all time.
B000003EUL|5.0|This is the best investment I've ever made: I will never, as long as I live (I'm 15), need to buy another recording of the Brahms 2nd or Appassionata--obviously this is difinitive.  So if you want to save money,  instead of spending it on five other recordings of the same piece (you know  who you are), but this one.     Just to go quickly into the App., with  seemingly every other artist the big chords in the first movement are just  noise(ex. Rubinstein) but with Richter for the first time they make  sense(this is a micocosim of whole CD).
0783225849|5.0|We all know how brilliant the movie was (especially Janet Leigh), so i won't focus on that. This DVD comes with lots of extras, including many  pictures, trailers, re- release trailers, and a wonderful documentary,  which features actors (Janet Leigh, Pat Hitchcock), the writer (Joseph  Stephano), and personal assistants of Hitchcock. This is definitely worth  the money!
B000002BE9|5.0|I tell you how I feel, but you don`t care...Tidal, the debut album from Ms Apple back in 1996.From the moody piano work, to the dark lyrics, Fiona has managed to make a great record.Her music sounds a little like Tori Amos,  but it is a lot more together, Fiona`s lyrics actually have meaning.For  example my favourite track on this album &quot;The First Taste&quot; the  opening lyrics go &quot;I lie in an early bed, thinking late thoughts.  Waiting for the black to replace my blue. I do not struggle in your web  because it was my aim to get caught. But daddy longlegs, I feel that I`m  finally growing weary. Of waiting to be consumed by you&quot;. That song  may not have much meaning to you, but you have to admit that it is very  poetic, some of the more meaning full song`s would have to be,  &quot;Shadowboxer&quot; &quot;Sleep To Dream&quot; and &quot;Sullen  Girl&quot;.From this album to her lattest release &quot;When The  Pawn..&quot; she has managed to maintain her sound, but at the same time  taken it to another level.All in all, you will not be disapointed with this  record, you will love it if you like, Tori Amos`s 98 release &quot;From The  Choirgirl Hotel&quot; Sinead O`Connor`s 94 release &quot;Universal  Mother&quot; Kate Bush`s 1980 release &quot;Never For Ever&quot; and her  1985 release &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;.In all I would give this album a 5  out of 5...
B000004CYT|5.0|Once, I was asked, by a young chap, how to explore 'classical music' and I was told by him, that his interest was coming from his knowing nothing.  Well, I explained that I didn't know anything either, but proposed, for his  consideration, the question, &quot;What is there to know, other than how  intensely you will come to feel?&quot; Further, &quot;That this feeling is  not what others can make for you by giving direction. That this beginning  in this 'unknowing' way was such a blissful state of being because the  exploration upon which he was embarking was literally a fruit flavoured  pathway of light into the heavens. His own journey upon which, he would  encounter women who fly and he would be cast glances by them, his  intuitions and his inspirations. He would, become so very enchanted that  the whole of his life, thenceforth, would be so imbued. Occasionally, there  would be even more significant adornings, yes, these being beautiful  rainbows, cast over his path and he would know these smiles as the musical  contribution standing resplendently among many of those he had already come  to admire and to love. These had been waiting for him, that he explore and  learn first and before being given, what would become for him, the ultimate  reflection of the wonderment beyond description which flies into human  dreams. Well, I experienced Beethoven's symphonies in this way. I had to  have them, all of the renditions, the performances. (Such does make for a  collection which appears impressive to the visitor, as you sit surrounded  by what stands behind stained glass doors and as you sit facing your guest  in a comfy chair, beneath the crystal chandolier and sipping on a glass of  malted Scottish nectar or two). However, only the renditions which take me  further away and make me feel the most, do I play. The Symphonies, by  Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music (which takes up no  space at all), was given me after many, many explorings along my pathway of  enlightenment, but the beautiful thing is, that the others, though most  often transcending, became almost evanescent, because Hogwood's Beethoven  was the smile of the rainbow and its power was of enormity.....It really  was. I could go on and compare, talk of facets of orchestration, the charm,  ad infinitum, but others do this with expertise. All I can say is, that  when listening to this particular collection, what I said does transpire.  The things which are bothersome in life and appear akin to flying vehicles  carrying smart bombs are treated by the winged women and taken away into  the furthest realms of the cosmos and there, disposed with, because they do  not matter. What does matter, is how I am made to feel, was meant to feel,  by what are, the most precious of all legacies. This is one of those  legagies and I say, thank you Christopher Hogwood.
0780627024|5.0|Writer of such big comedies Big and Dave. Gary Ross made is directorial debut with this funny and oddly touching film about a couple of beverly  hills teenagers who one night fight about the TV. In a breakout role Toby  McGuire of the touching Cider House Rules. Plays David who loves watching  an old 50's tv show named Pleasantville where everything is perfect. The  weather never changes and everybody is happy. So there is this marathon but  Jen played by Reese Witherspoon has this hot date so she needs the tv when  they fight over it they brake the remote. TV repair man shows up thanks to  Don Knotts. And hands them a special remote control that transports david  and jen into Pleasantville.<br /> Much like Jim carrys The Truman Show but  this is different. because they are transported in to a different world.  But while there Jen and david are Bud Mary Sue parker the children of  George and Betty parker. They turn the whole town upsidedown as the teens  are discovering sex and rock and roll. With Delightful and shrewd hints of  sitcom life.  Pleasantville was one of the best films of 1998. It is always  great to look at the changes of the town from crisp black and white to  glorious technicolor. The production design is impeccible and the visual  effects are astonishing. In keeping with the film Randy Newmans sweeping  score adds to the film alot. This film is very funny and oddly touching at  the same time. It has great performances from William H. Macy, Reese  Witherspoon, Joan Allen and a break out performance from Toby McGuire. Gary  Ross made is first directorial debut with style and will always be admired  by me.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is an outstanding CD. I hadn't heard it in 20 years but was so glad I picked up the CD.  It used to say on the back of the album, &quot;To be played at maxium volume&quot;.  Ain't that the truth.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is truly a movie both men and women can enjoy. Great action/battle scenes for men a touching story of a mans love for a woman (well two women  actually) Not to mention the story is great. For those few who don't  already know, this movie follows the story of William Wallace and his  attempt to free Scotland from England's rule. Perfect cast, honestly found  every performance believable. You don't need to be Scottish to feel the  stirrings of patriotism when Mel delivers his speeches to his troups. And  Mel does a good job making you believe he is Scottish, unlike  say....Costner's attempt to be in English in Robin Hood. 3 hours of pure  epic goodness.

B00003W8NM|5.0|I dont think there is enough space to explain what this movie is about so I wont go into detail. However, the central plot is about a disgruntled  yuppie who is in search of something more, a higher meaning to life, of  trying to break out of the zombie mentality that he sees all around in  society. The movie was beautifully filmed, many scenes have a 'trippy' feel  to them and I think you only really start to appreciate that the second  time you watch the film. The lead actors are incredible. I am no fan of  Brad Pitt, but he did a tremendous job. Norton, as always, gives a killer  performance (its only a matter of time until this buy has a shelf full of  Oscars). In terms of a DVD package, this rocks. Two discs worth of insane  Fight Club goodness including 4...yes I did say 4 commentary tracks. This  movie is likely to leave you disturbed (much the same as say a movie like A  Clockwork Orange)and it is supposed to, giving you something to think about  long after you've turned off the tv.
B00004S361|5.0|It is very difficult to put out two consecutive recordings of high calliber.  However, Stevie Wonder pulls off the feat with this fine  recording.  Maybe slightly less commercial than Innervisions,  Fulfillingness' First Finale still delivers with some funky yet varied  styles and some killer hooks on such standout numbers as You Haven't Done  Nothing, Creepin', Bird Of Beauty, and Boogie On Reggae Woman.  Bird Of  Beauty is a special number because of its very strong anti-drug message.  This recording will appeal to fans of rock and soul music as Stevie's  influence and messge is extremely powerful.
0394800184|5.0|Are you looking for a good book to introduce a small child to the joys of reading?  Then this one is a great one!<br />Long before I realized that babies are little sponges, someone gave me this book for my then first-born  one year old (1968! ) Since then, this book has been a staple for all my  children, the youngest now 8.<br />I have read to each child, before they  were one - only one isn't as fond of reading as the others, but even he  enjoys a good book now and again.<br />This book is the perfect book to  introduce little ones to the joys of reading.  The words are few and small,  and the question is one of interest to little ones who are still trying to  sort out what is going on in this new-to-them world.<br />The little bird  falls from her nest while mother bird is out getting worms.  She (or he)  goes to every animal she sees and asks, &quot;Are you my mommy?&quot;<br />This simple story keeps the child's interest, because the little ones  are concerned about what happens if they separate from a parent or  caregiver.<br />In the end, of course (I doubt that this is giving away the  story!) the bird finds the mother and all is right.<br />If you want your  children or grandchildren to enjoy reading, this book is an excellent  start.  Expect to have to read it over and over, so well that you both will  have it memorized!
6305858764|3.0|No. It falls short. That doesn't make it a bad movie In fact it's pretty good. As for suspense, I could put the VCR on pause, go make a sandwich  &amp; come back later. Harder to do with Hitchcock. The back-drop, for the  movie, Italy in the 50's was gorgous as a playground for the rich,  beautiful &amp; spoiled.  Jude Law's character, Dickie, didn't really  captivate me. His character was inconsistent but maybe that is what he was  aiming for. I didn't feel the charisma the other characters felt for him.  He was basically conflicted over his bi-sexuality. He hated himself &amp;  was a little off. I love Gwyenth Paltrow, but not in this movie. Her  character was necessary but she wasn't. The part was too light-weight. Any  actress could have played it. Actually Matt Damon as Tom Ripley did the  best job. He was not a psychopath as some reviewers have maintained. I  think his character resembled a much rarer &amp; dangerous sociopath. It is  also much harder to play. The detectives were totally unbelivable as such  total morons. I don't want to give up the story, but by this point, it's  probably too late.  Don't expect too much. It's not Hitchcock. It's a  popcorn movie. Enjoy it in that vein.
B000000OMJ|5.0|Pete's 3rd set the tone (and raised the bar) for everything that's come after it in pop music.  It gave new meaning to the word trip, for when played, it takes the listener on a journey from individual, to national  psychosis, with the richest soundscape attempted to that point.  The  consumate statement of the post-modern state.  Moody?  Yes.  The first time  I listened to it through, I was scared.  It took me months to warm up to  it.  Its musical technique and lyrical content have been heard repeatedly  in the music of many bands since 1980, without nearly the impact or  insight.  Without overstating too much, Peter's 3rd makes Nine Inch Nails  sound like sandbox chatter.  It also ushered in the era of World Music.   Certainly the best album of the 80s, and one of the best of all time.  It's  perfect.
0064407667|5.0|I'm a librarian at an elementary school, and I think these books are the best thing to happen to children's literature in a very long time. Unlike the Harry Potter books, which are lots of fun but merely entertainment,  these books really build a child's vocabulary and thinking skills without  sacrificing the entertainment value.  Buy these for your kids--they'll  thank you years later, when they're still rereading them. PS Anybody who  has complaints about the darkness in the subject matter ought to reread  some fairytales.  And ayone who complains about the tone of the books ought  to reconnect with their sense of humor!
6303160344|1.0|I noticed that the movie got rave reviews from some, but when I saw it all I could think was &quot;Uuhhhhhhhhhhhh&quot;. That's what this movie feels  like. It is LONG. and boring. Nothing happens. a lot of silence, and blue  stuff everywhere in the house, like blue glass chimes. Maybe it  &quot;spoke&quot; to some and forced them to tears, but I had to keep  myself from not screaming that I wanted my $2.75 rental money back, not to  mention the wasted 2 hours of my life. Ech. There are those who will either  really love this movie or really hate it. I'm with the latter. Wouldn't  recommend it on my worst enemy.
B00000IQC8|4.0|This is a must-have movie.  I don't think I really need to sayanything about this movie that others havent said.  We all know that it is the first in the so-called &quot;New Jersey Trilogy&quot; (minus 'Dogma' of course!)  by hometown Director/Actor/Comic afficianado Kevin Smith.  And just as Star Wars was the best of the &quot;Holy Trilogy&quot;, this was the best of the &quot;(Un)Holy Trilogy&quot;. Great flick, but my only complaint is the price.  I can kind of see the justification for it due to the added content, but it still seems a rather hefty premium for only a so-so translation from VHS. Anyways...that is the only reason for the 4 stars...5 would have gone to the DVD version if the price were [less expensive]...but ah, who cares, I will still pony up the dough anyways!  Snootchie Bootchies!
B00000JTB2|5.0|Buy this CD - I'm serious.  If you like Stevie Ray Vaughan's music even a little, you will be amazed by these songs.  It's very well recorded  (especially considering it's over 17 years old), there's not one track that  you'll want to skip, and the guitar jams that these two improvise will  literally leave your jaw hanging.  I love this album and wish I had  appreciated their music long before either one of them passed away.
B00000I952|4.0|In 1981, relations in the ABBA camp were strained by two divorces. The studio atmosphere was, reportedly, cool and according to Carl Magnus Palm  in his excellent book 'ABBA - the Complete Recording Sessions', Bjorn and  Benny were having a difficult time with some of the songs. All of which  makes ABBA's final album an intriguing proposition. You can HEAR the  struggles.<br />Although the album entered the UK chart at No.1 and spawned a  Top 3 hit in the shape of 'One Of Us', the album remains one of ABBA's most  underrated works. The production and vocal harmonies, though still magical,  were sparser and the arrangements were more experimental. The album was  something of a break from the traditional ABBA sound. The lead-off single,  'One Of Us' might have led fans to expect another poppy, 'Super Trouper'  kind of album. However, opening with the harder-edged, other-worldly title  track (with Frida in superb voice) the album was always going to challenge  preconceptions. The non-pop approach to songs like 'I Let The Music Speak'  (a show-tune without a show), the daftly Sgt. Pepper-ish 'Two For The Price  Of One' and the wonderfully chilling 'Like An Angel Passing Through My  Room' were a definite departure. While songs like 'Soldiers' and 'Head Over  Heels' might have been more 'trademark ABBA', there was still an element of  progress and experimentation evident in the arrangements.<br />Arguably, the  US market got the better singles from this set.  The first single, 'When  All Is Said And Done', is probably ABBA's best 'bad-marriage' song and  eschews self-pity in favour of dignity and strength (another spectacular  vocal by Frida).  The second single, 'The Visitors', became an air-pay hit  on cutting-edge US college radio and deservedly garnered rave reviews and a  modest Billboard chart placing. The UK singles, 'One Of Us' and 'Head Over  Heels' were ostensibly much 'safer' bets. Although the latter's failure to  reach the UK Top 20 would indicate that the yanks had the right  idea....<br />Certainly, this album won't be what the casual CD buyer might  expect from an ABBA album: it's low on kitsch and dance tunes. However,  repeated listening pays dividends. This remastered version is augmented by  4 bonus tracks, including the wonderful 'The Day Before You Came', a song  which would beautify any collection (the band's last ever recording, it was  originally cut several months after this album's original release).<br />Which  takes me to an important gripe... This re-masters series has been shoddily  handled. Firstly, buyers should be warned that there is an inexplicable  surge in volume mid-way through 'I Let The Music Speak'. The inclusion of  the throwaway B-side 'You Owe Me One' does the album no favours and really  should have been replaced by the other contemporary B-side, 'Cassandra', a  quality song which suits the overall feel of the album much better. The  artwork looks like it has been bootlegged and whoever designed the on-disc  labels should be strung up. A terrific album has been marred by cheap  re-marketing.nks had the right  idea....<br />Certainly, this album won't be what the casual CD buyer might  expect from an ABBA album: it's low on kitsch and dance tunes.

B00004TJFL|5.0|I don't see why people think that this is the worst movie with Michael  Myers. I really liked it. People say that they hate it because of his mask.  You don't really notice how bad the mask looks like throughout the film.  The killings were great. And Donald Pleasence did a great job acting. I  suggest you rent or buy this movie, but after you've seen the 4th one.
B000007O9L|5.0|Playing on the early 90's craze of unplugged concerts, The Stones got their capitalistic heads together and put this record out to a huge fan base desperate for an alternative to the uncreative, somewhat boring music  the Stones had been creating for 15 years leading up to this release.   And  boy was it ever a great decision.  From the first strum of Street Fighting  Man, you can tell the Stones are back from the vaults, unfazed.   The  playlist is perfect; Not Fade Away sounds as crisp and full of Bo Diddley  as it ever did.  Throughout, Jagger sings with purpose and feeling, while  Keith Richards and Ron Wood get the wheels rolling with a great cast of  additional musicians.   What makes this album standout from all the other  Stones live releases is the play of pianist Chuck Leavell, who adds the  perfect touch of keyboard and honky tonk piano to cover the Stones lack of  cohesion vocally.  Leavell tears into beautiful, building scales and  absords the Stones sound and pushes it further.   The entire album is  easily listenable, and enjoying.  At no point do you even contemplate  forwarding to another track.   It's really that good, especially when you  compare it with official live Stones releases..
0517122707|5.0|John Kennedy Toole killed himself because nobody would publish this book. His efforts had gone unnoticed, thought he; he was a failure. History proves him wrong, as we have seen A Confederacy of Dunces go on to win the  Pulitzer and has reached and entertained countless readers. The book itself  is sheer genius, as was the man behind it. <br />There is not a moment where  this book lags. Every sentence keeps popping fresh bubbles. The imagery is  hilarious and the word choice and sentence structure is exquisite! Some  parts of the book make you laugh outright at the sheer insanity of the  writer's humor. The characters seem to come alive as you read. <br />Ignatius  Reilly is a 300 lb. lovable goof who lives with his mother. Throughout the  book, we see him combatting every thing and every person he encounters. He  is a martyr to non-conformity and to his ego. Very set in his ways, he goes  from job to job, angering people to the point of insanity! Yet, he simply  doesn't care. His poor mother! All you think about during this book is what  will Ignatius do next?<br />John Kennedy Toole was a also martyr, not only to  his art but, like Ignatius Reilly, also to his own ego. He breathed life  into his characters and it was too much for him to bear that nobody could  see them alive and performing right before our very eyes, and so the  tragedy occured which planted the seed for a generation of readers to  harvest his great humor and style.   While he is not alive to reap the  benefits he so desired, the book is a gift to a multitude of readers. One  can only hope that the John Kennedy Toole's of today are not overlooked.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This albums stands for the come back of Bruce Dickinson in the band. Even if, I came to also like Blaze alot, especially on Virtual XI, which is a  masterpiece of Iron Maiden, introducing new chords, different lyrics,  keeping up with strong bass background, and some incredible solos for  Janick and Dave. This one brings pretty much the same, a new face of Iron  Maiden, and their abilities to change, without which they would not have  made it till now, remaining one of the most famous hard rock band ever, if  not the most famous. They truly deserve their title. Brave New World is  another masterpiece, with songs that shall remain as reference for long,  added to the already long list they produced so far. This album might sound  slightly different, but still in the vein of Iron Maiden hard rock. Strong,  fast, smooth, slow... always rocks.
0671034065|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I'm used to more intense books from Linda Howard, but humorous books have always been my favorite.  She sure did come through on this one.  At times I was laughing so hard, I'm sure people  thought I had something wrong with me.  As far I'm concerned, Sam Donavon  is Mr. Perfect!  The character of Jaine was fantastic as well.  I'd love to  see another book starring this outrageous couple.
B000002UKS|5.0|Now first i should say that the foo fighters are my favorite band so i'm kinda of partial to them but i'll try my hardest. The cd starts off with  Doll which when i heard i though i had the wrong cd but then again every cd  needs some slow songs.  Then comes up Monkey Wrench, a kickin' song that is  defintly one of the heavier songs the Foo fighters have done. Hey, Johnny  Park (one of my fav. songs ever) is a reminscent of classic rock, with that  indefinable foo fighters touch added to it.  My poor brian is a cool song  but i still dont get what it has to do with anything but its got awsome  lyrics.  Wind Up (which almost describes me) is such a good song, with such  provacative lyrics, it made me think what could have made Dave &amp; the  gang write it. Up in arms is one of those songs that if you just heard the  begining of it on the radio you might change the station is auctully a very  good song. My hero which is a classic of the Foo Fighters, has an awsome  drum part with some great lyrics.  See you is a song that you might not  like at first but then after a few times around will start humming to.   Enough space is an odd song but its got the classic screaming your voice  out, and then when they go from the serious voice of everlong to screaming  its quite an awsome transition. February stars is a nice slow song that  would make a nice slow dance but didnt get enough publicity, still a nice  song. Everlong, which when i heard it in accustic had me speechless, is  even better on the album (but it would have made the album better to  include the accustic version).  Walking after you doesnt sound at all like  the foo fighters and i dont like it that much (if theres a negative to this  cd its this song and the length (46 minutes way to short)).  And what a  great way to end the cd with new way home with a good song by a great band,  nothing special about htis song but its a good one.  If you're only going  to buy one CD this year make it this one.
0790743213|5.0|Quintessential Hitchcock. Made just in between Hitchcock's best films; 'Vertigo' and 'Psycho'. 'North By Northwest' is more lighthearted and fun  than those films, less psychologically oriented and more glossy good old  fashioned entertainment. Hitchcock took the 'innocent man on the run'  dilemma he practically invented in 'The 39 Steps' and then further explored  in 'Saboteur, but perfected in this classic film. In one of the definitive  Cary Grant roles, Grant was in peak form and at his most charming. It's  hard to imagine anyone else as Roger Thornhill or any other person who can  melt women with just a look, only Grant can do that. Endlessly entertaining  and sprinkled with wit and intrigue, one of the classic screen  entertainments. This time Eva Marie Saint is the 'icy blonde' a look that  obviously appealed to Hitchcock and a lot of actresses are living proof of  that; Grace Kelly, Kim Novak, Madeleine Carroll, Janet Leigh, etc. There is  an incredibly sexy (and long) kissing sequence that could compare with the  one Grand and Ingrid Bergman had in Hitch's 'Notorious', while not as tense  or as unbearably sexy it's still as memorable. James Mason is excellent as  the villainous Phillip Vandamme and this is one rare occasion when his  voice does not seem distracting in fact it kind of fits appropriately.  Martin Landau is also equally memorable as Vandamme's thug, there are some  homosexual undercurrents to his character. Filled with many memorable  scenes like the assassination in the UN, Cary Grant trying to drive a car  while drunk and of course the now classic crop-dusting sequence that is  pure Hitchcock genius all the way. The cliffhanger ending on Mount Rushmore  is incredibly suspenseful and equally memorable. One of the most constantly  entertaining films of all time, Hitchcock at his peak and at his most  charming. Extras: Hitchcock's usual cameo; this time as the man who barely  misses the bus in the beginning credits. From a scale of 1-10 I givethis  film a 10!
B00000064F|4.0|What can I say? Nick Drake at his happiest - which is funny because most of his stuff is so depressing.<br />While Pink Moon is my favorite, based on  the sheer simplicity of the album, this one is great in its own right.   Tunes like 'Hazey Jane' and 'At the Chime of the City Clock' dig  deep.<br />This album suffered from poor timing - it came out in the midst of  several monumental albums.
6304385668|5.0|Neil Jordan has done Ireland and Irish history a service by introducing to  the world one of the most fascinating revolutionary leaders in any country  and the only successful revolutionary leader in Irish History.  Collins'  exploits were long kept under a veil because of the enmities and guilt that  resulted from the Irish civil war, where former comrades were pitted  against each other and many on both sides felt betrayed. Jordan has brought  to light again the incredible accomplishment of a largely self-educated  country boy from county Cork who finally managed to lead his country to  freedom after 700 years of British oppression.  In doing so, he beat the  British at their own game, destroying their intelligence network in Ireland  and demoralizing their police force.  His was a unique combination of  courage, charisma, wit, ruthlessness, audacity, cunning and love of  country, and it was high time his story was told.  Thank you, Neil Jordan.
6302794331|5.0|There are so many reasons to enjoy this version of the Dicken's classic.  Who knew that such an odd combination of the Muppets and Oscar winner  Michael Caine could make such a wonderful ensemble cast?  Of course, with  the Muppets, the wackiness and fun that children adore (and, admit it  adults, so do you) is present throughout the movie and Michael Caine does a  fine job of adding just the right touch of drama.  However, I must say, the  scene stealers are Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat as the narrators, and, of  course, Miss Piggy as Mrs. Cratchet.  They create several laugh out loud  moments.  The story, moral, and animated characters all combine to make  this a must-have Christmas film.  It serves as a wonderful escape film for  adults and quality entertainment for children.
079213690X|5.0|One of the two best movies I have ever seen, this movie seems to be about the Scottish fight for freedom from Britain.  But that fight is the  background of the movie, not its driving purpose.  This movie is about the  rarest kind of man -- the man who won't break.
0800105141|5.0|This movie was the realization of a lifetime dream for Sir Richard  Attenborough, who finally succeeded in bringing this incredible spectacular  to theatrical release in 1982. I was living outside London working for the  American Forces in the greater London area at the time, so was thrilled to  have the privilege to see this movie in its limited initial release in  Britain, and was amazed by its scope, accuracy and integrity in bringing  the quite controversial facts surrounding Gandhi's life and  politically-motivated assassination to the screen. Ben Kingsley is simply  magnificent as the diminutive, principled, and indefatigable lawyer,  humanitarian, and citizen of the world with an uncannily prescient feel for  what was possible for a determined and energetic person  as well as how to  achieve his lofty otherworldly goals right here on earth.<br /><br />Based on his  approach here, Attenborough seems to have learned much from such masterful  British film-makers as David Lean, for the use of scenery, topography, and  natural surrounding of the characters as they wind through the more than 40  years of story line is breath-taking. His methods owe much to the kind of  subtle insinuation of the local environment David Lean in particular used  so memorably in movies like \\"Bridge Over The River Kwai\\" and \\"Lawrence of  Arabia\\" (see my reviews) in making the scenery more than an incidental  player in the storyline. Seeing Gandhi immersed in the incredible  multidimensional diversities that were (and are) India helps the viewer as  we begin to understand just how incredible his efforts were to unite the  country with his strange yet irresistible moral authority, an authority  that all of the various factions recognized and respected as the authentic thing.<br /><br />There is, of course, an immensely talented cast, including Martin  Sheen as an American newspaper correspondent who becomes intrigued by  Gandhi's profound and surprisingly effective non-violent approach to social  change. Gandhi's approach to using reason and morality to approach issues  and perspectives, and these methods become the real star of the film as it  builds slowly over the scope of this very literate and intelligent script.  This is a wonderful motion picture experience for anyone willing to sit  through the more than three hour extravaganza, one that guarantees  Attenborough's prominent place in film history, and one that leaves this  reviewer smacking his lips in anticipation of whatever other wonderful  effort such as this may someday appear based on Attenborough's talents,  visions, and moral sensibilities.

158234082X|4.0|Kitchen Confidential is more of an autobiography than an expose of the upscale restaurant industry.  Certainly we feel privileged to have the insider's view of the kitchen, and the uninitiated will have a better  understanding of the restaurant industry.  Mr. Bourdain proffers tips on  what to seek out, what to avoid, and why the kitchens at some of the most  exclusive restaurants in the world are anything but what we expected them  to be. But if the purpose of the novel was an expose of the underbelly of  haute cuisine, the author's contribution could have been made in less than  50 pages.  But the insiders' guide that you think you're getting is  auxiliary to Anthony Bourdain's story of his life in relation to food.  And  it's a good story.  The author is a decent writer and has a refreshing  style of narrative; very frank, upbeat and witty.  But the novel is a  little longer than necessary.  While the final chapter was invigorating,  edifying and compelling, the few chapters preceding it were tedious, much  of it repetitive.  Though I was contemplating finishing the book a bit  early, the final chapter rewarded my patience.  My advice: if you find  yourself restless two-thirds through the novel and want to put it away,  feel free to skip to the last chapter.
0782008372|4.0|I really thought (as is so often the case) that the content added by the director's cut really makes this a much better movie. Ideas which one had  to guess at are explained or can be inferred from the extra footage. Too  bad the idiot American editors out there can't figure out that much of the  audiences they are trying to &quot;protect&quot; are probably far more  discerning then they are. (i.e. stop trying to help us!)      The audio  track commentary from the producer/director cast was great too. It provided  interesting insights and thoughts behind things. They also discuss many of  the differences between the American and the Eurpoean(=Director's) cut. One  example I got a kick out of: originally they wanted the pro wrestling scene  to be Ice Hockey -- they were trying to portray that modern society is  still violent. Get this - the hockey association (no, I don't remember the  name, I'm not a fan) wouldn't allow it. They didn't want to be portrayed as  a VIOLENT SPORT! Gee, I guess all those fights are really hugs where  someone slipped...      Anyway, to me, often the behind the scenes  commentary and extra features like this are really BIG bonuses one gets  with the DVD versions, which can enrich the thoughtful viewer's expeience  of the film -- and these seem to be often overlooked.       So all things  considered, a very nice value for under ten bucks, and a great story for  certain. <br />     A thought on the commonly cited audio/video  &quot;quality&quot; problems:      I just have a &quot;normal&quot; TV with  coaxial input. On this 19&quot; TV (fed  from the standard audio/video out  through an RF modulator), the video and audio seems as good or better than  a VHS videotape. I wonder if this is a big part of the problem with the  wide discrepency reported in the quality in the reviews - the final viewing  &quot;hardware setup&quot;. So, just a thought, maybe a direct TV hookup  will make this DVD more enjoyable, masking some of the  &quot;blemishes&quot;? Might be worth trying for the disappointed fans. All   fancy new technology (not just computers) requires &quot;fiddling  with&quot; at times to get optimum results.
B00004TH83|5.0|Why not stop comparing her to Celine or anyone and listen to her MUSIC.  There are so many good songs on this cd.  Tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11 are  great songs.  That is 7 out of 13 songs that are great.  She belts out  songs like no one can.  She has a good set of lungs on her.  Most of her  songs are slow and very heartfelt.  I love the chorus to Love By Grace.  It  makes me think about past relationships.  I Will Love Again is a great pick  me up song, and To Love Again will hit the heart of anyone who thinks that  they can get back together with an ex.  Just take a good listen, the cd  speaks for itself.
014028009X|4.0|A female colleague gave me Bridget Jones's Diary, insisting that it isn't a &quot;girlie book&quot; but rather a funny book even men could like.  Well, she is both wrong and right.  It is most definitely a book about and  for women, but it is so light hearted and funny that even men can enjoy it  (assuming they can get over the embarassment of being seen with such a  book!).<br />Bridget Jones is a story of one year in the life on a 30-ish,  single London girl.  She is constantly in panic mode, unbelievably  obsessive about her weight, looks, and what people think of her.  No, the  story is hardly original.  But Ms. Fielding takes these female stereotypes  and blows them out of such hilarious proportions that, well, it's hard not  to laugh with (and at) Bridget's problems.  And men will find Bridget Jones  generally likeable because, fortunately, the story doesn't take its  &quot;man bashing&quot; very seriously.<br />Being a middle-aged (American)  male in London, I thought the world was looking at me when I read this  &quot;girlie&quot; book on the Underground.  But this didn't bother me in  the least; it's their loss for not reading it themselves.<br />And for those  who might think my female colleague is some sort of Bridget Jones herself,  guess again.  The previous book she loaned me was Crime and Punishment  (..fat chance Bridget would buy let alone read that!).

The author's  personal accounting of torture, beating and maltreatment of POWs by the  Japanese is a cool condemnation in black type on white paper of the inhuman  treatment common in the Pacific.  Lomax's almost causal recounting of how  he was tortured makes that section even more difficult to read.<br />The  title, \\"The Railway Man\\", comes from the author's life long obsession with  the railroads and locomotives.  His observations of railroads and  locomotives makes some of the more vivid writing in his autobiography.  His  personal journey from hatred of the Japanese translator, who participated  in prisoners' torture, to forgiveness of that person, marks one of the  highlights of the book.  I would recommend this book to anyone who believes  the Japanese acted in a civilized manner in the war they started in the  Pacific.
B00004NHCC|5.0|What else can I say? This 1954 pairing of Sarah Vaughn and Clifford Brown at the absolute top of their game is astonishingly beautiful artistry with  no frills no gimmickry, just stripped naked emotions. This one will leave  you yerning for more. Unfortunately Clifford Brown would be gone just two  years after this recording date. At least they left this one great record  behind...truly one for the ages.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This hasn't been the top-selling CD in America for a while for no reason whatsoever. It is truly one of the greatest rap CDs to come out in quite  awhile, the only other one that even gives it a run for its money is Dre's  2001. Eminem simply has one of the greatest gifts for lyrics that rap has  seen recently.<br />I love this album for many reasons, but most of all  because there is so much contained within it. Every time I listen to it, I  pick up on some new nuance or lyric that I didn't quite fully understand  before. Eminem has the gift that so many of our great artists of word have  which is the ability to pack as many different meanings and complex  thoughts into as few words as possible.<br />This album is in some ways  similar to Slim Shady in that it is a collection of songs thinking about  similar subjects, but where this one stands out is in the diversity of  songs. There are simply more and different styles of beats as well as  topics on here than there were on the first album.<br />There are really some  great songs on here. The best of course and what many people consider to be  the best is &quot;Stan&quot; This self-referential look at fame and those  who idolize stars is quite interesting and very thought provoking at the  same time. Of course there is the first single &quot;The Real Slim  Shady&quot; which has gotten so much coverage because of its rips on so  many famous celebrities, but it is truly a nice piece of work, and has a  beat that just sticks in the back of your mind. &quot;Kill You&quot; is a  very angry song with a lot of emotion tied in to it. And the CD rounds out  with a nice collection of just great flows, &quot;Kim&quot;,  &quot;Criminal&quot; and &quot;Under the Influence&quot;<br />Overall this is  a great piece of work and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an  interest in rap.
B000002LVB|4.0|This isn't quite the Velvet Underground we all know and love. It's really just Lou Reed and Sterling Morrison. Many will argue that Lou Reed WAS the Velvet Underground, but I differ. He's never produced anything on his own  that matches the first three VU albums. How good is this particular album,  though? Pretty fine. &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; does indeed deserve its place  as the Lou Reed's signature tune. &quot;Head Held High&quot; is absolutely  top-notch. And &quot;Train Round the Bend&quot; is possibly my favorite  song by any band. I love that song's sentiment (&quot;sick of the country /  take me to the city&quot;) and it has a drunken, meandering, propulsive  quality that is quite unique and wonderful. I also have a sentimental  attachment to &quot;Who Loves the Sun.&quot; Beyond those four songs,  though, I don't really care for the rest of the album. I suppose &quot;Rock  and Roll&quot; has some charm.
B000001GPX|5.0|This is the Quintessential Classical Recording.  Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is probably the most well known and well-regarded of any piece of  classical music out there, and this recording of it by Kleiber and the  Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is probably the best recording.  It is so  full of life and energy that it really reaches out to you and draws you in.  Moreover, the price is very good and you get the 7th symphony almost for  free which is really good in its own right.  This is also one of the best  old recordings I've found, so many older recordings have a terrible sound  to them but this one is really good.  I reccomend this CD for anyone  interested in classical music.
158234082X|5.0|Bourdain has answered all my questions about cooking and chefs, I think!  I have had a tendency to think chefs were like the ones we see on TV shows, with this peak into the underbelly of the kitchen, I can see that a job is  a job is a job!   The same personality types are found in every workplace.   The descriptions of the food and how it comes to the plate were great.  I  esp. liked the chapter where he took us from the time he woke up until his  day was over.  Keep writing and cooking, I will look for your next book!
6305903182|5.0|It's literally impossible to express in 1000 words or less how good Scream  3 is.  But I'll try my best.  Here goes...<br />Sidney Prescott (Neve  Campbell), after surviving The Windsor College murders a few years ago is  now living in quiet seclusion in the picturesque mountains, far far away  from any knife wielding psychopath with a ghost mask...or even her old  friends.  In fact, she has no friends--the only person she talks to is her  father and she has Dewey Riley's phone number just in case.  Meanwhile,  down in Hollywood Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) and John Milton (Lance  Henriksen) are making STAB 3: Return to Woodsboro, the final chapter in the  STAB trilogy.  But when it's cast members begin to get knocked off one by  one in the order their characters die in the script the movie is shut down.   With actors out of work only one question remains--who's doing this..and  why?  Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David  Arquette) are also back to help out Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick  Dempsey) to help out with the case.  When Sidney is drawn out of hiding to  do some helping of her own and try yo lessen the body count all hell breaks  loose all the way down to the inevitable showdown and unmasking of the  killer/s and what a surprise it is!!<br />Screenwriter Ehren Kruger (Arlington  Road) and director Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) have done a  wonderful job in scaring their audience half to death and then making them  laugh until another scream erupts.  The score is great, the cinematography  is excellent, the acting is top notch, it's so funny...should I go on?  Oh  yeah, one more thing--the extras on this DVD include Outtakes which are  quiet frankly hilarious, Deleted scenes--ummm yummy!!  Creed's What If  music video is great as is an Alternate Ending and best of all...Audio  Commentary with Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier (the editor) and Marriane  Maddalena (one of the producers).<br />Get out there and buy this DVD  now...you WON'T REGRET IT!!!
6302732875|5.0|I bought this movie because Alec Baldwin (one of my favorite actors) is in it.  I'd never seen it before--wasn't interested when it first came out in  theatres, had never even seen the play on stage--but I'd heard Baldwin was  brilliant in it, so I bought it.<br />Now I'm kicking myself for never having  seen it on the big screen.  And I've seen it at least a dozen times since  buying it.<br />The story, if you've read any reviews, you already know:  Four  guys in a real estate office (Jack Lemmon, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, and Al  Pacino) are in a sales contest from &quot;Mitch and Murray&quot;, the big  bosses from downtown.  As the slick-suited real estate millionaire sent to  motivate the sales force (Baldwin, in a role written expressly for the  film) explains, &quot;First prize is a Cadillac.[...]Second prize is a set  of steak knives.  Third prize is you're fired.&quot;  With such motivation  complete, Office Manager Williamson (Kevin Spacey, in his first big role)  hands out the night's allotment sales leads, and they're pure  drek...driving the men to various stages of desperation to ensure they  don't fall off the sales board.<br />That's the story.  What makes this movie  work is the outstanding performances.  Pacino as office hot-shot Ricky Roma  got the film's only Oscar nod for acting, but Jack Lemmon's performance as  Shelley &quot;The Machine&quot; Levine would have been a better choice.   Levine hasn't had a sale in months, and has lost his edge; his scene  bargaining with Williamson for a better lead capsulizes Levine's  frustration and fears perfectly.  Just to watch Lemmon, a wondrous actor,  bring every nuance of this character to life is fascinating.<br />As for the  reason I bought this in the first place, Alec Baldwin?  He's magnificent.   You'll forget he's only in one scene; his character's threats and emotional  manipulation swirl through every scene in the film.  His profanity-laced  motivational speech is searing; you can feel every man inthe room cringe  as he verbally emasculates them in the name of generating more sales for  the unseen Mitch and Murray.  And the film's most quotable lines come from  him:  &quot;Put that coffee down!  Coffee is for closers.&quot;   &quot;What's my name?  F--k you, that's my name!  You know why?  Because  you drove a Hyundai to get here, and I drove a $80,000 BMW.  THAT'S my  name.&quot;  &quot;A-B-C--Always Be Closing.  Always Be Closing.  ALWAYS BE  CLOSING!&quot;<br />Enough talking.  See the movie.
B00003CWTH|4.0|Magnolia is a haunting 3 hour tale of.................whatever!  At times  it seems this film is meandering recklessly around in circles, never  touching upon a significant point.  Subtle plot lines appear and then  disappear into another newly introduced plot, keeping the viewer constantly  transfixed, but always baffled.  Magnolia has moments of brilliance, like  intense performances by the red haired actress (her name escapes me), and  an unconventional style of directing by Paul Thomas Anderson (king of the  zoom in close up!).  The music of Aimee Mann also works effectively for  this film, giving it a stately presence of somber bleakness.  The ending of  this film was quite bizarre, but original, leaving the viewer in question.   Do you have to be a cokehead to understand?  Who was talking to her?  What  the hell were they talking about?  Why was she smiling?  Was it a coke  thing?  AGGGGGGGGGG!  Whatever!
0792838068|5.0|It's a joke that this didn't win more Oscars or even get nominated for  Best Picture. It's possibly the best film of the decade.Ebert once said:  &quot;No great film is depressing - all bad ones are.&quot;Right on,  chubby.Both lead performances are exceptional. Nic Cage can actually make  you laugh while he breaks your heart. The score is fantastic, contrary to  what other Jabronis have written on here.THis film will endure. Classes  will study it for decades to come.(All this and you get to see Elisabeth  Shue's boobies for the first time! - Giddyup!!)
B000000W6R|5.0|OK, so it's not all a noisy din. For instance, the aptly named first song, \\"Soothe,\\" features a gentle opening with only Billy Corgan's close voice and a wispy acoustic guitar. Recorded in his apartment at the spur of the moment on some beautiful inspiration, \\"Soothe\\" catches the essence and spirit of this great album.<br /><br />These awesome backburner B-sides probably best the songs heard on [[ASIN:B000000W6F Gish]], for the most part. \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" is the definition of spontaneous musical output, songs truly recorded in the spirit of the moment in the early 1990s. \\"Plume\\" features a lazy and rough-grinding riff, accompanied by endearing slacker values: \\"I don't care to give enough,\\" moans Corgan morosely, as if he has no intention of becoming the hip new voice of his generation. After the breezy tunes \\"Whir\\" and \\"Blew Away,\\" this album really kicks into a higher gear, as the supreme rockers \\"Pissant\\" and \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" blow everything over within one hundred feet of their path, like an angry tornado of sound. These two songs are as raw and feisty as this band has ever been, and were recorded in a muffled style at a fast and furious pace. Perhaps it's not ear candy, especially for those expecting tunes like \\"Today,\\" \\"Mayonaise\\" or \\"Sweet Sweet,\\" but it is some great rock and roll. Between Jimmy Chamerlain's snappy and forceful drums, the all-encompassing bellowing guitars and a huge bass sound, one can't help but be bowled over. \\"Hello Kitty Kat\\" is especially a hard-driving tune, easily one of the hardest of this band's storied career. On it, the Pumpkins sound like a bunch of teenagers trying to prove themselves, which may not be too far from the truth.<br /><br />As a whole, it's the middle of \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" that is untouchable.  After the hard rockers, \\"Obscured,\\" a dreamy acoustic tune with a country-tinged slide guitar and laid-back lyrics, slows things down to a mesmerizing degree. One of the Pumpkins' best slow songs ever, \\"Obscured\\" is achingly beautiful. And \\"Starla\\" (like many of these songs), probably deserved A-side status somewhere in the Pumpkin cannon. It begins slow,  psychadelic and seductive, with soft and echoey guitars that build to climactically buzzing electric guitars, which then revert back to quiet, simple, almost humble beginnings. Meanwhile, Corgan repetatively sings basically the same lyrics and refrain, which leads to a dramatic, purposely long, guitar-fueled, bass-heavy grand finale. \\"Starla\\" is one of the coolest rock songs ever written.<br /><br />Arguably, \\"Pisces Iscariot\\" may have ended just fine on the energized aura of \\"Starla.\\" Anything after that song is bound to be a bit of a letdown. However, some of the album's more interesting tunes kick in at the end. \\"Blue\\" can also be found on the short EP [[ASIN:B000000HRY Lull]], and was a nice addition to this album. \\"Girl Named Sandoz\\" has a grittier, almost blues/rock feel, quite different from most of Corgan's work to that point. The following \\"La Dolly Vita\\" has a certain swaying  groove, and probably ranks as the album's most polished effort. Corgan  branches out yet again on \\"Spaced, the closing tune, indeed a relaxing and spacey piece of work, full of echoes and a whining slide guitar. The last three songs stick out like a sore thumb amid the early-'90s vibe of the proceeding songs, yet they show Corgan further spreading his sonic wings and branching out his style. It's easy to see why so many thought this band had great potential at such a young age. Full of fire, spirit and talent, fed from a charismatic and ambitious lead singer, the Smashing Pumpkins owned the world with these remarkable songs.\\"Starla\\" (like many of these songs), probably deserved A-side status somewhere in the Pumpkin cannon.

B000002UAO|5.0|I remember being 15 years old and buying Rubber Soul back in England.It was so amazing to this teenager I would just play it endlessly,repeating each side of the old plastic record.The songs just stood up and hit you in  the face,so radical for the period,it's easy now to see how The Beatles  changed peolpe's lives so dramatically,Baby You Can Drive My Car,Norwegian  Wood, some of the words were so clever,containing so much social content  and overt criticism,wow,the times were indeed changing,and The Beatles  along with Dylan were the main causes.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This CD is the best blink one yet, it is their first one with parental advisory witch makes it better. First if their was more than 5 stars I would give it 1000000000000+. Second the best tracks are  #1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.

Starts with such  force on the drums and guitar that it will get you hooked for the rest of  the ulbum.<br />Another day: Very very nice song, really shows how good James  is at vocals...Simple lyrics for those with simple minds.<br />Surrounded:  Great lyrics...guitar is awsome...not a filler.<br />Take the time: One of  their best song and most underated... again, shows how good James can  sing.<br />Metropolis: Consider my many, DT's best song...Complex,  Powerfull...full of emotion...takes time to really understand how this song  could be their best...<br />Under a glass moon: Simple song, but again with  all of DT's ingredents.<br />Wait for sleep: KEYBOARD.<br />Learning to live:  Bassist's star ending...complex, extreme lyrics.
B0000041XX|4.0|This is my favourite,before the formula became &quot;stale&quot;,it is by no means the best,the Chicago one in my opinion takes that accolade, but the athmosphere on this is special, and domingo's rendition of &quot;You  are my hearts delight&quot; is a real treat. Some parts are unintentionally  funny, such as their duet of &quot;la vie en rose&quot; images of  &quot;piaf&quot; and waif like sparrows dying for love, were conjured  up,the look on pavarotti's face said it all. Zubin Mehta conducted with  aplomb,and there duet of o solo mio was sublime,the end a rollicking  rendition of Nessum Dorma was what a good sing song is all about!
0767827716|5.0|I don't like the film versions of books,but this one is really different,carpenter's talents are outstanding.
6304258984|5.0|This is a movie that i genuinely enjoyed. The movie had an excellent plot.  The actors were outstanding. Sean Connery and Nicholas Cage played the  heros very weel Ed Harris was outstanding in his role as a disillusioned  Marine General. When Harris and his former troops seize Alcatraz and  threaten San Francisco with chemical weapons the UniteD States government  has to find an answer. Navy Seals(who were well played) are slaughtered by  the Marine troops fall short. The government is forced to call upon the  only man to ever break out of Alcatraz(Sean Connery). Connery,accompanied  by chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage penetrates Alcatraz. The action  from that point is nonstop. Connery and Cage finally manage to offst and  nuetralize the chemical weapons. Cage declares that Connery has been killed  and Connery escapes to freedom after being imprisoned for more than 20  years. The final scene,where Cage obtains stolen film is a very fitting end  to a good movie. This is a must see movie. Be sure to see it.
158234082X|5.0|I have been a fan of Mr. Bourdain's since reading his first novel &quot;Bone in the Throat&quot; and second one &quot;Gone Bamboo.&quot;  My husband and I just hope that he doesn't decide to give up writing for being  a chef.  We look forward to lots of great reading from this very talented  author.
B000001FXR|5.0|Catch A Fire is an album with a very strong beginning (the haunting, pointed 'Concrete Jungle') and doesn't let up for the rest of the album. <br />The first four songs are uniformly strong, and showcase the musical  talents of both Marley and fellow original Wailer Peter Tosh (particularly  the rhythmically dynamic '400 Years'). <br />The album sags the smallest bit  in the middle, particularly with 'Baby We've Got A Date.' It's not a bad  song by any means, but seems a little out of place considering the rest of  Catch A Fire. 'Stir It Up,' much better in its original form than the  popular cover version, drags a little, but the vocals and instrumentals  make it worth listening.<br />The album picks up again after the midsection,  with the humorous 'Kinky Reggae' and the moody 'No More Trouble' and  'Midnight Ravers.'<br />Catch A Fire is definitely a great album, and  absolutely astounding for a world debut. Most of the songs are distinctly  Marley-flavored (save for the two Peter Tosh numbers), so Burnin' may be a  better choice for Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh enthusiasts. But, if you like  reggae, you can't possibly do better than this.
B000003TAW|5.0|These guys deserve a lot more recognition. Among all the loud, depressing alternative albums of the time came this loud, FUNNY album. There is not one single weak song on this entire album! Plus, it is very catchy and  great to sing along to. Rivers Cuomo is a very good writer and the band is  very impressive. They put a lot of feeling into everything. I'm sure most  people with a television have seen the video for &quot;Buddy Holly.&quot;  It is one of the coolest things you'll ever watch! If that's all you've  heard by them, then you ain't heard nothin' yet! There are several songs on  here that rank up there with the greatest anthems of all time, especially  &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; with all its peaks and the drawn-out ending.  This is one of the coolest albums of the 90s and has become somewhat of a  classic. You will never regret buying this album and you should do so now!

0792846443|5.0|I would find it hard to believe that too many people haven't seen this Stephen King classic, but if you haven't this is an absolute must see.  James Caan is a novelist struggling to make a break for the mold he has  been placed in because of the success of his series of romance novels based  on his character Misery. Caan goes on vacation in the mountains to finish  his newest book, which is supposed to an edgy break from his previous work.  After a terrible car accident Caan is rescued by Annie Wilkes (Played by  Kathy Bates), a seemingly kind and sweet nurse who offers to get him back  on his feet. Annie, as it turns out, is the world's biggest Misery fan, or  should I say the world's biggest deranged fan. What ensues is some of the  most shocking and frightening moments in cinema history. I promise that you  will be sitting on the edge of your seat for this entire movie, and there  will be times that you will not be able to watch.<br />Kathy Bates deservedly  won an Oscar for her portrayal of the devoted \\"Misery\\" fan. Her swing from  one emotion to another is believable, and terrifyingly real. She does a  tremendous job of making her character seem like your average next door  neighbor, then like your worst nightmare. James Caan is perfect as the  writer held captive in the home of this obviously unbalanced woman. He  portrays a breadth of emotion as he tries to cope with his captivity. From  the apprehensive beginnings, to the desperate attempts at freedom, to his  eventual courage to fight back. (I also love the casting of Richard  Farnsworth as the local sheriff. Has he ever played a character you didn't  like?)<br />Rob Reiner's direction is terrific and always keeps the action  moving even in the most intricate of scenes. You can see that he let's both  Caan and Bates play their respective roles, and move the film along like  the consummate professionals they are. The screenplay adapted from King's  novel is superb, and makes this movie a suspense classic. Ofall of the  Stephen King novels that have been turned into big screen features, this  one is very true to the book, which is what gives it its intensity. If you  have never seen this movie, you really should, and if you haven't seen it  for a while pick up a copy. I bet it will still shock you.
B0000041WV|5.0|It's hard to believe that Decca is reissuing this set at this price given the fact that it pretty much renders most of the more recent, full price  recordings of Dvorak moot.  This is simply a terrific cycle of the Dvorak  symphonies! <br />Kertesz brings life and excitement to all these pieces.  His  touch works especially well in the first six symphonies, which are all  sadly neglected in the concert hall.  Rhythms are crisp and bracing. The  orchestral sound pulses with life.   The Amazon reviewer rightly notes that  the playing isn't perfect, but there is so much vibrancy to the playing  that the occasional crudeness is irrelevant.<br />This bargain is also an  excellent introduction to the treasures that lie in Dvorak's early  symphonies.  Numbers one and two are certainly overlong, but you have to  love the scherzo of the first.  Three and four are considered Wagnerian by  many critics, but both contain a wealth of gorgeous melody.  (I especially  like the opening of three and the soaring melody introduced a few minutes  into the Finale of 4.) Five is a wonderfully bucolic piece (at least until  the Finale), with another memorable scherzo. Six is very Brahmsian--with a  wonderful opening movement rich with horns.<br />You may have recordings of  the last three, but Kertesz need not bow before anyone in these pieces, so  don't let duplication keep you from getting this.  I noticed that DG has  rereleased the wonderful Kubelik cycle, but it is more expensive.  Get this  one and hope that DG offers Kubelik on separate discs so that you can get  his fabulous sixth.

0684872153|4.0|This was an excellent story, one that I would recommend to almost anyone looking for a great book.  McCourt's writing style is very different from any that I've read, and the way he can remember the smallest detail from a  childhood experience is amazing. This is a gripping story that will keep  you reading until the end.  I also enjoyed this book better than the  sequel.

B00003W8NM|2.0|This is a movie (as somebody said) that you will either love or hate. I, for one, didn't like (won't say hate) the movie much.  I still think  Fincher made an awesome movie in Seven, however  Fight Club doesn't even  close. It's about mindless fighting (so what if a bored idiot wants to vent  out his anger by swinging fists) Very little acting required on part of  actors.  All they do is deliver witty (but uninspiring) dialogues. The  background commentary gets annoying after some time. The movie is devoid of  plot. Watch this movie only to learn that it's your own sh#t that you use  to wash your face. Waste of money!
0425152251|5.0|Sophies World is an absolutely extraordinary adventure through imaginative and intellectual realms!  Never have I pondered so deeply nor wondered so profoundly.  While you take a course of the history of philosophy with the  main character, you discover amazing theories, are interwined in solving a  mystery, and ultimately contemplate the words you read on each page with so  much thought and wonder.  This book is amazing in its power to enlighten!   Highly recommended for those readers who desire to heighten thier  understanding of life, enhance thier creative minds, or just want to gain a  better understanding of philosophy.
0441172717|5.0|If you are a fan of sci-fi, or even if you're not, this is truly one of the greatest books ever. Frank Herbert creates a fantastic world filled with amazing creatures like the sand worms, and unforgetable characters,  such as Lady Jessica and Pual Maud'dib Atriedes.<br />In the story there is  one main plot, yet there are also sub plots, like Paul becoming the kwisatz  haderach--the male Bene Geserit. I can't really put this book into  words--you just have to read it for yourself. And if you have trouble  understanding this beautiful and complex Dune universe, there is also the  handy glossary in the back to help you understand the words. But don't just  sit there reading this review--read Dune!
0783223218|2.0|Modern society is impatient and lacks the mental ability to appreciate many fine things.  If you do not fit into MTV society, don't waste your  time and see the original.  Yes, the original is slower.  But it is  smarter.  You don't have some stupid only some guy in prison knows the guy.   Let's rip off the Rock a little more.  Richard Gere's character was  superfluous.  The greatness of the original was that it was a cat and  mouse, tense movie.  This movie is fair at best.  I wouldn't waste your  time with this.  There are much better, less trite, less predictable movies  being made today.
0767802659|2.0|This movie presents itself as a campy satire of militarism, Nazism/Fascism, and glossy teen melodramas, but degenerates too often into  an UNironically-cliched space-opera gorefest, though one filled with  excellent special effects and gorgeous young performers--and, hell, with  pretty impressive gore, too.  I like the spoofs of government wartime  propaganda (complete with giant CENSORED labels) and a few other  dark-humored scenes, such as the one in which a military recruiter, minus  an arm and both legs, proudly says &quot;The army made me what I am  today.&quot;      However, I have to wonder (as other Amazonian reviewers  have) why the government doesn't bomb the bugs, instead of sending in  ill-equipped ground troops to die.  I also have to wonder why a government  advanced enough to develop giant videophones, laser machine-guns, and  high-speed intergalactic battlecraft can't clone new arms or legs for its  amputee soldiers, or at least construct bionic limbs.  And was ANY satire  intended in the scene where a black soldier publicly whips the white hero  Rico, or in the scene where another black soldier happily dances to  &quot;Dixie&quot;?
B000001EMW|2.0|Apocalyptica makes me want to listen to Metallica.  These guys would do better to compose their own original heavy-metal influenced peices. Great  idea, just not fully realized.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This DVD nears perfection.  It has everything you could possibly be  interested in, and and even more.  From the different versions of the film  to the alternate ending to the Easter Eggs (which include various 'on the  spot' new coverage videos) this DVD rocks.  I honestly cannot think of  anyone who wouldn't like this DVD based solely on its' special features.   Yes, the story was a little pat, but come on...  Definitely recommended!!!
0345350472|5.0|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep cannot be easily compared to the following movie, for they are both great in their own way.  The book provides necessary explanations for the characters' actions, great plot,  lots of cool sci-fi motifs.  The movie (Director's cut, of course) lacks  nothing - it is beautifully rendered by Ridley Scott with great imagery of  a dystopian futuristic (according to the 80's) world. <br />My recommendation  is that you read the novel and see the movie - it is the only way to fully  enjoy the wonder of artificial intelligence embedded in an almost human  body.  A must for any sci-fi/fantasy/cyberpunk reader and anyone who even  for a second experienced the fearful greatness of paranoia.
6304466498|3.0|After seeing &quot;Scary Movie&quot; I kept thining about other spoofs. See my problem with &quot;Scary Movie&quot; was the lack of originality.  But one can't say the same about this movie. Brooks takes characters from  mostly &quot;Star Wars&quot; and adds his own ideas,spoofing movis from of  course &quot;Star Wars&quot;,&quot;Star Trek&quot;,and there's even room  for &quot;Planet Of The Apes&quot;! Brooks delivers what might be  considered the best performance in the movie playing Yogurt(aka Yoda)and  President Skroob(Which is an anagram of Brooks' name. And also the  &quot;Emperor&quot; version in this film). I've noticed a lot of people  seem to think that Rick Moranis was the best part of the film portraying a  &quot;Darth Vader&quot; type character named &quot;Dark Helmet&quot;-who as  the films goes on we find out loves to play with dolls,how manly! There's  some really funny visually gags in this film,none of which I'm going to  give away,because the ones that work are truly priceless,and will turn out  to be some of the funniest stuff you've ever seen! Of course not all of  them work. But this is still a fun silly movie to watch when your alone on  a Friday or Saturday night. It also helps if your familar with sci-fi  movies. &quot;May the Schwartz be with you&quot;,when you watch this.
0375703764|2.0|As a dedicated fan of the ghost story in its many incarnations, I expected great things from this book. Perhaps that was my mistake, expecting a &quot;story.&quot;  Instead, I found that the many annoted footnotes just  detracted from the overall effect. This is a brilliant concept and the  extreme attention to detail lends some credibility to the genre of  overlapping reality and fiction. But the constant distraction of looking  here and there at footnotes, half of which are for effect instead of  information, made it seem like a thesis, not a novel. And as to the story  itself, there's not much there. A great approach theoretically, with  potential, but its basically a concept piece and not too engaging a book.
0440219078|4.0|This book is about a futuristic community where sameness is the rule, decisions are made for its citizens,and everyone is safe and provided for.  It was skillfully written to cause the reader to feel almost positively (at  first) about the practices of the people in this community until he/she  thinks twice about them.  As the story unfolds, one realizes that a  terrible mistake has been made in creating this society.  Some have said  that this book is not suitable for young people to read because it is  likely to cause (or aggravate) depression.  However, when I read the book I  felt just the opposite feeling: gratitude.  It made me realize that it is  only because we experience pain that we can experience joy.  Also, when  reading this book, it is important to realize that our world is not like  that in The Giver.  It is better.   I would recommend this book to anyone,  young or old.
B000002JOH|5.0|This is a great record.  I am a metal fan, but I get disheartened by bands who have good backing tracks, and lousy vocals where the singer simply  screams or grunts in an attempt to sound like satan.  These guys get away  with it.  The vocal style suits them, its not there just for the sake of  sounding evil.  Anselmo doesn't grunt just to let you know that he is  tougher than you are, it just works.  If you have the intelligence to  realize that this record is more than another big-balled heavy metal band,  you will get many years of enjoyment out of it.
0694013889|4.0|This is a hokey book which contains all of the worst visual representations of the 60s and 70s.  Still, my child loves it.  True, she  usually thinks the potty depicted here is a cup, and says yes to the  question of whether it is a vase to hold flowers every time, but she gets  the picture (how could she not, the illustrations are that obvious). The  illustrations are only good in the sense that the more realistic books do  not adequately portray missing the potty.  But, the illustrations reflect a  terrible era. Think muu-muus, the stylized dove, 2-d everything, shades of  orange, pink and avocado.  I really don't like reading this -- the words  are stilted, the colors are horrifying, but it seems to work (or such is  the consensus among mothers I know).
B00000JZIK|5.0|When I first began watching this movie, I was captivated. Its detailed  plot and fascinating characters made for a remarkably intelligent story. If  anyone cannot understand this simple movie, they should be shot. This was a  fabulously written and directed movie with excellent actors; it is the one  of the best modern classics of our time.
B00004WGC4|5.0|This is a great series!  It's too bad that it only had 12 episodes.  If  you love Monty Python, you will wet yourself when you see this.  If you  hate Monty Python......urm.....I bet you will love this!  British humor at  its best!!!!!!
0679746048|5.0|If you are a female, you have to read this book.  It is as simple as that.  It is absolutely fanstastic.  Kaysen has a way of drawing us into her world and make it seem beautiful and calm even behind the brick and mortar  that is McLean Hospital.  Also, if you read the book, you much watch the  movie.  Both were the best of their respected media that I have read/seen  in a long, long tinme.
6305075379|3.0|The original Australian theatrical release is best.  This DVD looks fine.  It has a crisp picture and good sound. I was however extremely dissapointed  to hear the POORLY overdubbed American voices and miss certain cut  sequences. Not only that but there are NO special features or extended  menus, just a chapter search. This movie DESERVES a special studio upgrade.  It must be remastered, uncut and include trailers, commentry, interviews  etc. Mad Max is a new wave masterpeice and must be  given the attention  it's worthy of.
B00000AF95|1.0|If you are like me, you are a big Kiss fan, but are too cheap to buy every album they ever did. This is without a doubt their worst. If you must get it, buy it at a pawn shop or used record store.... I'm sure you  won't have any trouble finding them there.
B0000009OX|4.0|I have to admit, I really tried to hate this album at the start, not only because The Undertones are my Dad's favorite all-time band but also because of the lyrical and musical simplicity of the whole thing. But I gave in and  I now think it is a very good CD. Sharkey's shaky, innocent voice proves  very effective supported by catchy, repetitive, gentle but rapid  guitaring.This album always puts you in a good mood and always keep you on  your feet.The songs are short, fast and raw and very simple(I'm suprised to  learn that this 70's Irish band have been called Punkers).                                                                                                                                All the songs are pretty good and  alike  and it is good value with 23 good songs and you'll never find yourself  skipping any ones. With a great album like this, The Undertones deserve  their place in history.
B00000IPAX|2.0|Enema of the State isn't that great. Blink has no talent, I play guitar and am able to play all their songs without a single problem.<br />I am only giving this two stars because Travis really is an amazing drummer and the  other star goes to the barely listenable songs.<br />Tip: Have Mark sing, Tom  sure as hell can't.<br />And it isn't even punk, some people accuse The  Offspring of selling out (they did not), I am surprised no one has accused  that of Blink 182.<br />If you want pure Punk, go buy Pennywise, or The  Vandals, you want Punk Rock, buy The Offspring.
0671034065|5.0|I'll let you in on a little secret in case you're new to this author.  No one doses it better than Linda Howard.  Like Alice in the looking glass, you will fall in to the pages of this book and you will have to remind your  self to come up for air. As always the sex sizzles, the caracters are real  and multi dimensional, the story is riveting.  WARNING! After you read this  one, you will find yourself in a mad scramble to locate all her other  books.  Good luck.
B00004U2HK|5.0|Oh sure, there are moments that Post-Moderns will rate as camp and kitsch, but the overall effect of this lively musical can lift even the most  cynical urbanites.  Maria, The Captain and the troupe evidence the best in  human nature, and director Wise - no slouch - vividly paints a sylvan,  civilized world threatened by the barbarism of encroaching Nazis and  Fascists.  Who can knock Maria's wonderful spunk and enthusiasm for living  and loving, or the Captain's hard shell as Maria deftly melts it?  Yeah,  it's corny and sucrose in parts - musicals rarely skirt sentimentality -  but it's wonderful family entertainment, and a lyrical illustration of  'where the day can take you' if you have the courage to listen to your  heart.  Young Love was never so sweet as &quot;Sixteen Going on  Seventeen&quot;. Let down your armor and enjoy this timeless gem, and in  the words of the Old Sister belting out at the window, 'follow every  rainbow, til you find your dream'.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Ok, I'm no critic...but this album has truly taken me by surprise.  I'm the type that buys a CD just because there's one song on it that I like and  then usually ends up with 12 other songs I don't like.  This was most  definitely not the case.  I bought it for &quot;Crash and Burn&quot; but  have found almost every song at least as enjoyable as that one.  I judge a  CD by how many songs I hit the &quot;repeat&quot; button on so I can learn  the lyrics, and I can honestly say...only one song on this CD did not  achieve this distinction.  If you're a sing-along type like I am, you'll  love this CD...the upbeat songs have great, feel-good rhythms and funky  lyrics, and the ballads are so full of soul you'll find yourself lost in  them.
B0000027RL|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I cried like a two year old in awe of the sheer beauty and passion that it beholded.There never was or  never will be a session of music recorded like it again. You don't have to  know or understand the lyrics to feel the passion in Vedder's deep, ravaged  voice. Unfortunatly it's passion is so great that Pearl jam have since been  mistaken for messed up headboppers by the mainstream. This band, although  have enjoyed big success with this album and with the other ones since it,  should have been as big as U2, as distinct as Led Zepplin and as memorable  as The Doors, I guess they just came along in the wrong era and the only  people could class them as being new wave rock or the dreaded grunge.  This  debut by the seattle fivesome is a classic masterpiece. It shows Black  Sabbath influences(only a lot better)for the opening two songs 'Once' and  'Even Flow'-- their classic hard rock favorite, and they prove brilliant  pacesetters for the rest of the album.The next song is the unforgettable  'Alive' a great song sung amazingly by Vedder.'Why go?' is a rock which  always rocks you to the toenail. 'Black' is probably the most liked song on  the album which is a slow, vain love song which rarely fails to bring a  tear to my eye. The next song, Jeremy(arguably the finest) is a traumatic  epic of a boy who commits suicide in the classroom(you should see the  brilliant video of it, it really grips you).'Oceans' is an easy listening  ballad and it shows in detail the flexability of Vedder's vocals. 'Porch'  is a popular live at concerts because of the songs own flexibility and is a  classically quick and simple love song. 'Garden' is another once off ten  classic and hypnotises you with it's slow, complex and distant  progression.'Deep' is another under-recognised rock song from this  unbelievably great album.Vedder's great voice again is the trademark of  this song.As is the final great song of a great album, 'Release'.   <br />Vedder's voice and memorable lyrics, Gossards songwriting, McCready's  guitaring,(Krusen's drumming is a slight little bit off at times,  although). Oh what the heck, if you're looking for the greatest music ever  recorded in any class or form, you're at the right place. For god's sake  don't miss it-- whoever you are. You can be guaranteed many neverending  hours experiencing the allure and passion of Pearl Jam's wonderful 'Ten'.
B000002L6P|5.0|This is a superstar album, and this proved Madonna was not only an entertainer, but a business woman as well. For one, she picked Nile Rodgers, the young Quincy Jones of music to produce the album. He produced a solid album for her, with virtually every song being fantastic. Not only does it in contain top-notch tunes like the title track \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Dress You Up\\", \\"Angel\\", and \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\", it also contains the best song Madonna and Stephen Bray came up with, \\"Pretender\\". It's serious, deep, and flawless. When you here the album you'll realize that it is slick too. A brilliant classic.
B000002ULO|5.0|If there is a McCartney album in which every single song is a dream to listen to, then it's this one. 'Flaming Pie' by far is the greatest of all of Paul McCartney's solo endeavors; each song is innovative, beautiful, and  completely unforgettable, particularly his quiet, simple 'Calico Skies',  and the gigantic, orchestrated masterpiece 'Beautiful Night'. There is not  a single other album by Paul that is this creative and this magnificent;  truly a work of art by the greatest popular music songwriter in history.
6304056958|5.0|This is defintely one of the best comedies of all time. It is a classy and impressive motion picture, not like the majority of comedy films that are  made today. The film is all about the behaviour of upper class women in the  1930's. The story revolves around happily married Mary Haines (Norma  Shearer), her gossipy cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell), and the  sleek and cunning Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Using her seductive  manner, Crystal (Crawford) seduces Mary's (Shearer) husband with hopes of  eventual marriage between the two, therby securing her a wealthy lifestyle.  But Mary will do whatever it takes to get her husband back. Along the way  we are introduced to other women who are having the same problems.  Wonderful performances by the entire cast, however Crawford is the  highpoint of the film. She is an absolute steal as the bitchy, clever,  &amp; seductive perfume saleswoman. Definitely a must-see film.
0446677450|5.0|I watched him on the Oprah Winfrey show and was amazed by his story of sucess and how it helped others. After reading his book I realized that this one book was my key to financial freedom that I had been longing for.  I read this book in one day which I never finish a book in one day. It is a  book you just cant put down with fun stories that help you learn more about  cashflow and how to increase it. The illustrations are an eyeopener for  people who learn better words as well as from pictures. You will love this  book and want more information at your feet. It made me want to learn more  about stocks, bonds, Ira's, real estate and many other forms of investing  for my future. Thank you so much for this wonderful gift of wisdom.
6302824729|5.0|This movie is amazing.  It is filled with dramatic adventures and  challenges that Daniel is faced with and yet he conquers every one of them  by applying the wisdom taught by his master.  This is a must-see movie,  particulary for those who liked the first version.
B000002U82|5.0|Aside from its reputation as being one of rock music's most successful albums, and its remarkable stay on the Billboard Top 100 charts for an  unprecedented and undefeated 741 weeks, Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon  is artistically speaking, a striking example of rock at its freshest and  most innovative. Although many of the aural techniques utilized on the  album can trace their origins back to many of their predecessors, these  techniques combined with the prevailing themes of the album produced a  compositional masterpiece that was strikingly distinct and unique, placing  it aside from many of the albums of its day. The album which deals with the  fleetingness of life, political disenchantment, violence and madness begins  brilliantly with a faint heartbeat which eventually becomes more prominent.  The heartbeat comes into full fruitation when the ticking of clocks and the  ringing of cash registers comes into the soundscape with sound bytes of  various people discussing their personal views on madness. The point that  Roger Waters (principal songwriter and leader of the band) is laying forth  becomes clear. Waters cites the fleetingness of the human experience and  mankind's propensity towards madness and destruction (hardly the typical  themes associated with rock music). The sounds reach a crescendo, bordering  on the lines of disorientation and confusion and then is broken down by a  series of screams which lead into the first song. The first track Breathe  begins languidly and is accompanied by Gavid Gilmour's spacey and fluid  slide guitar. The song introduces Gilmour's raspy, yet soothing voice which  blends with the mellow feel of the song. The chord progressions are  relatively simple yet stunningly effective. No time is wasted as Breathe is  connected to the next piece On the Run. Although On the Run is primarily an  experimental sound piece, it remains well structured, lush, and textured.  The next song Time, which is quite possibly the best song on the record,  features Pink Floyd at the top of their game. It is at this point that Pink  Floyd brilliantly employs the use of a choir to add to the already stunning  textures of the album. The album travels through the funky, yet timeless  Money all the way to the sublime and tranquil Us and Them. The album  plunges itself into the total decay of madness with the ever brilliant  Brain Damage which is then brought home by the stunning and powerful  Eclipse. The album then fades into the darkness with the same heartbeat  that introduces it. The only minor flaw that latches on to this album is  the instumental piece The Great Gig in The Sky. This piece should have been  shortened with or dispensed with as it is lengthy and mundane and doesn't  provide an acceptable introduction to the next song Money. Despite this  minor quibble Dark Side of the Moon is an evocative and telling concept  album.
B000002LQR|5.0|I wasn't really into the chili peppers when i first heard them. I was at my friend's house and he had this cd and i just wanted to borrow it see how i liked it. After i heard this cd i couldn't stop listening to it. this  album is just amazing. i love the chili peppers now and i am a huge fan.  they are just awesome because they have their own style and it's not like  all the other rock stuff you hear. it's unique and i give it 5 stars, if  there was ten i would give it ten, and i think anyone who enjoys the  peppers deserves to own this cd!
0805047905|5.0|Young children are very attracted to this book. When I have a selection of books available for my grandchildren, they always look for this one. They have learned colors and animals and how to &quot;read&quot; from memory  from this book.  I would highly recommend it.  Another great book is  &quot;The Very Hungry Caterpillar.&quot;
068484267X|5.0|Through the eyes of a child. Frank McCourt's New York Times best seller is one of the most vivid and beautiful books ever written. His way of writing from an innocent boy to a teenager is so appealing and so brilliant. This  book is the story of Frank McCourt, who was born to an alcoholic father and  depressed young mother in the Depression in New York. His earliest memories  are in New York where his brothers, Malachy and the twins Oliver and Eugene  were born along with his sister, Margaret. After the death of the infant  Margaret, the McCourts move to Limerick, Ireland, Frank's mother's  hometown. There he experiences more deaths and more births along with rude  Catholics, a mean aunt, strict teachers, an uncle who works in the coal  factory (therefore his face is always black) and fleas. Hilarious compared  to its darkness, this book deserves more than five stars.
B00000K31Q|1.0|1. This movie had a bad script. 2. They had marginal actors. 3. An overall  bad idea for a movie. 4. It dragged on and on. 5. I would've rather watched  the Blob again (for me it was a terrible movie) 6. The people who were  dating kept on getting mad at eachother and made up about three times. 7.  It was filmed in Tacoma which is right by Seattle, but they said it was in  Seattle. Our city got no credit what so ever. 8. I don't need to watch  other people solve their teenage problems because I've got my own. 9. I had  to spend $12 on it to watch it in a hotel only once. 10. Elizabeth Berkley  or Gina Gershon weren't in it. The one thing that I did like about it was  that it was filmed in my home town, at my friend's house, at my high  school, and my friends were in it. That's the only reason I'm going to buy  it. I'm a movie fanatic and I'd like to be able to point out all the places  in my school where a scene took place and mumble it happily but quietly to  myself.
B000001GQB|5.0|For Mozart's late symphonies, Böhm is the one who does it best. There really need be no argument about it, because the only people who prefer,  say, Marriner, do so because of the greater tempo and the lightness. THAT  style (faster, lighter, springier, from a small ensemble, like the ASMF) is  more suited for the early symphonies, and I think many people will agree  with me about this.<br />For symphonies like the master 40th, it is not  springiness we want: we want the depth, and the joy-in-tears, which only  Böhm brings out. Mozart had advanced from the 25th to the 40th - the  recommended tempo and style is simply not the same. This happens because he  wrote so many symphonies, something which you will not find in, say,  Brahms. There was a word used by the Amazon reviewer which sticks:  &quot;love&quot;. He said Böhm conducts Mozart with true love and feeling.  Yes, that is definitely it - you can see the conductor's love for the  composer and the composition. And the resulting feeling - is from out of  this world. The ASMF-Marriner simply does not achieve this. We can have  raging debates about whether Mozart &quot;intended&quot; it this way or  that, but I think the concensus is that Böhm's style is IT.<br />This is a  deeply felt, personal recommendation from me. If you want to listen to the  late Mozart symphonies, listen to Böhm.  You will find nothing better.<br />I  have one major beef though. The fourth movement of the 40th is the  shortened version (no repeat of the first theme). Can anyone tell me of a  recording in which Böhm did the full version?<br />All said and done, this set  is IT. Look no firther. Take it from a listener with a lifetime of  experience with different conductors/composers/orchestra combinations.
0671510991|5.0|Diplomacy, by Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, is a comprehensive review of the theory and practice of statesmanship narrated by the most accomplished diplomat of our time.  From the raison d'etat of Cardinal Richelieu to the glasnost of Mikhail Gorbachev, Kissinger describes each era's key practicioners of the diplomatic arts with a familiarity borne of a lifetime of dedicated research.<br />Modern diplomacy is the result of the efforts of those who developed the art over the centuries.  The great statesmen of Europe: Richelieu, Metternich, Bismarck, et. al. each developed their theories of international relations based on their nation's unique set of historical and geopolitical circumstances.  The striking thing is how little things have changed. Kissinger shows how modern statesmen still make decisions based on the same factors today.<br />Dr. Kissinger begins his review of America's contributions to statesmanship by examining our two foremost foreign policy theorists: Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson.  Kissinger depicts these gentlemen as the architects of our foreign policy and shows how succeeding administrations have followed the policies of one or the other.  He also reviews World Wars I and II and the dreams of overly idealistic Americans that motivated those generations to make tremendous sacrifices in order to make the world a better place to live.  In both cases, our hopes of creating a world composed of truly democratic nations was dashed by the realpolitik of our adversaries. Still, despite two world wars, Korea and Vietnam, our idealism is intact enabling us to remain a beacon of freedom for all the world.<br />Dr. Kissinger writes about diplomatic leaders, past and present, with complete familiarity.  It's almost as if he's describing a group of close friends that he meets at the club every week for a game of high-stakes poker.  The difference is Kissinger knows them so well he can accurately predict what they will do and why.  We're fortunate he is onour side!<br />Diplomacy is an important addition to the library of every student and practicioner of the international political process.  Advanced students of World History and International Relations will profit from his conclusions.  Beginning students will be inspired to conduct more dilligent research on the events he describes.  I am personally much better informed for having read this book.  You will be as well!
B0000004V2|5.0|I purchased The Stone Roses first album when it was released in 1989, and to this day it continues to prove itself to be the most influential album  in my life. A complete album start to finish. Brilliant.
0792844882|5.0|I everything about this movie... the dancing, the plot, thedirecting, the acting, but most of all, the reality. This movie is about a young girl who has to claw her way to the top in Vegas to achieve fame and soon realizes by the end, that it wasn't worth it. Deep down inside I think it's a movie that says, &quot;Stay in school.&quot; This movie may seem bad to some people, but at least it doesn't glorify things like sex and violence. This movie took guts to make on everyone's part and they all pulled it off.  I hate that some people only watch it for the nudity, that's sick. You have to look past that for some sort of inner meaning. If the Oscars weren't so stuck up this would've won best picture. Elizabeth Berkley or Gina Gershon if you're out there, e-mail me. I'm both of your biggest fans and I think you've done a great job on this and all of your other movies.  END
0783230664|4.0|I don't like schmaltz.  I like a movie with a chip on its shoulder.  Case in point: I think &quot;Fight Club&quot; is one of the best and most  important films to come out of Hollywood in a decade.  I thought I'd get  wasted and see &quot;Babe&quot; because it seemed like a good afternoon's  diversion.<br />But &quot;Babe&quot; is not shallow fare.  From the opening  images it begins to draw you into a world of awe and innocence -- but this  film has a dark streak, too. It's the brainchild of George Romero  (&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;), and you know you're in for more  than a kiddie movie when a pig, apparently promoted out of the pen and sent  to some supposedly utopian paradise, is carted away in a meat truck.  The  secret is this:  unlike kids' movies, &quot;Babe&quot; doesn't try to  convince us that all is right in the world; instead it speaks to us in the  innocent tones of the farm animals while it allows us to see the dark  corners.<br />And the characters!  Neurotic ducks try to find their backbones.   Mother dogs mourn the loss of their litters to adoption.  And a bitter old  sheep dog, perfectly voiced, swallows his pride and begins to deal with a  tormented past.  Some of the internal dramas are of Shakespearian depth and  power.<br />Parents, do not fret.  Kids will love this movie in the way you  loved &quot;Charlotte's Web&quot; or &quot;Bambi&quot;.  I loved it like  &quot;Animal Farm&quot; or &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.  There's  something here for everyone.<br />Unless you're one of those people who wants  to see all of the movie as it was shot.  Why is this masterpiece not  letterboxed in its DVD release?  Because the studio considers it a kids'  movie and kids have an aversion to the widescreen aspect ratio?  I saw this  film 10 times in the theaters; it would be my first DVD purchase if the  studio didn't insist on lopping off the sides of the frame to fill a  stupid, outdated (HD is coming) TV format.  For this reason alone, I'mholding off on buying the DVD until this travesty is corrected.
0767849493|1.0|This movie goes so badly as movies can go... The duo of Damon and Affleck think they made a master-piece of controversy, but that's not case: it's  only a master-piece of boredom. Director kevin Smith forgot what film  making is all about. THe plot is horrenndous, Morrissette appears out of  the blue (clever agent..) nothing works here. Linda Fiorentino could have  been replaced by a door, so bad was her acting. Sad...
0380730367|5.0|Dennis Lehane is a bad man. An awesome storyteller. His strength is his consistency in all of his novels. I don't feel that any one story is better than the other. In all of his novels, the new characters he creates stay in  your memory long after you read one. And I don't just mean the villians. It  may be a guy or two in the department, an agent at the bureau, or a friend  in the press. All of his characters, likable or not, good or bad, ring with  originality and all have their own voice. And when it comes to  bone-chilling violence and eye watering dialogue, Lehane has no peers. End  of story. Go buy his.
B000002MFE|5.0|To be perfectly honest, I'm probably a bit biased on this recording. I've love Clapton's music for a long time now, and own a good percentage of his recordings. So to say I liked this, isn't a huge jump for me. However I  honestly think that this is one of the best recordings around, and  certainly one of my favorites. Very different from earlier works (of all  forms) at least for the most part, it never-the-less works wodners on the  mind. He plays each song gently  and with soul, particularly the deep Tears  in Heaven (4) and melodic version of Layla (7). Rivaled only by his Rainbow  Concert in my mind, this is one CD that is always in the car for trips.
B00000K19E|5.0|An extremely entertaining and interesting film from the Wachowski brothers.  Great special effects (duh!), intriguing sci-fi story, superb  editing and sound, and a hell lot of action and fun!  Buy this freaking DVD  now!
B00004STPT|5.0|This is an awesome CD.  Usually, I listen to either alternative or pop music, but this CD takes my breath away.  Most people wouldn't think a 13 year old would like this, but I do!  I am a huge fan of the movie and I  have seen it 4 times!  If you like the movie, then GET THIS CD!   When you  listen to it, you feel like you are sitting right there in the theater  again.  It's impressive.  Buy it now and strength and honor to all  Gladiator fans!
B000005Z0G|4.0|If you ask me, Tupac Shakur was himself in his first album.  During the time this album was first released, Tupac was more of a party guy who loved  hip-hop music (especially when he was with Digital Underground).  Later on  during his career, he turned into some kind of a thug that kept on getting  in trouble with the law.  Tupac isn't a thug like he wanted people to  believe, and saying that he's the &quot;greatest rapper of all time&quot;  is a very bold statement; personally I don't agree with that statement.  I  believe people started to say that just because he died, and especially  because now people are labeling the late Big Pun as the greatest rapper of  all time, just like before when they labeled Notorious BIG as the greatest  rapper of all time when he died.  Bottom Line: I think Tupac shined the  brightest on this album, especially because he has features with his old  school crew Digital Underground, and he doesn't try to portray himself as  some kind of a thug.  If you want to hear &quot;the real Tupac Shakur&quot;  and &quot;real lyrics from his heart and soul,&quot; then this is the album  to have.  His later albums weren't as powerful and became very lame.
B00003CXBK|5.0|PRINCESS MONONOKE is one of the most wonderous and magical films I've ever seen.  I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to the DVD.  If you  haven't seen this film, you're really mission out on something-- a truly  beautiful Japanese-mythological tale about the war between human and  nature.  It's amazing, and well worth your money.
B00004TDTO|5.0|That is one of the most classic lines in the movie, JAWS.  and along with  that the movie itself is classic.  From the brilliant screen adaptation of  Peter Benchley's book to the excellent direction of a young Steven  Spielberg to the chilling, all too familiar orchastra music by John  Williams ...I could go on forever about this film. One thing I forgot about  was just how great the acting was in this film, did Robert Shaw even get  nominated for an OSCAR? He should have won it!  and of course, Richard  Dreyfeuss is brilliant in everything he does.  The acting all around is  just great.   One other thing about JAWS is that it is just as scary now as  it was the first time I saw it.  It is full of great suspense, action, a  great story that gets you hooked in everytime.  I can see clearly that  Hitchcock was one of Spielberg's inspirations.  It is merely the suspense  of the movie that brings us to the edge of our seats.  The movie is almost  half over before we actually see the shark.  I think that is what makes  this film one of the best of it's genre.   Today there are too many gory  bloodbaths of films, we need to get back to the basics, or we could just  buy the dvd JAWS...I know I'm glad I did.
6305252521|5.0|The Truman Show easily is the best film from 1998.  How it got ignored for Best Picture is beyond belief . . . here is a truly original and  fascinating film, acting incredibly by Jim Carrey, and directed expertly by  Peter Weir.  The DVD isn't filled with many features and extras, but  still-- the movie is definately worth owning.
6305903182|5.0|Far better than the second. Cant wait for Part 4.
0451163516|2.0|Although I read the book quickly, it became impossible to suspend disbelief. The actions of some of the characters simply made no sense... except to move the plot along. While the book has many twists, many were  not plausable. The enjoyment of the book, therefore, was signficantly  reduced as the actions of the characters (particularly the mother and  daughter) became silly. It's too bad becasue Follett is a good writer and  &quot;The Man from St. Petersburg&quot; had great potential. &quot;The Eye  of the Needle&quot; was far superior - it easily passed the plausability  test.
B00004U3UG|5.0|Army was terrific. Cant wait for Sam Raimis career to faulter so a fourth  can be made.
0783117388|5.0|I am a 37 year old single woman and nothing hits the nail on the head like Carrie &amp; Co.  No one ever believes what I say about the rules of  dating, etc. until my friends started watching Sex and the City and heard  it straight from the ladies!  I love the show and purchased the videos  since I did not see the very beginning of the show.  Wow it has come a long  way in a short period of time!  I love it!  Every 20-something and  30-something woman should buy this!   It rocks! :)
B000002H97|5.0|This is the last good album that Metallica has done to date(besides S&amp;M). Every song on this CD is excellent to say the least. This is  probably the 2nd best Metallica album other than Master of Puppets. My  favorite songs are Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Wherever I May Roam, and  My Friend Misery. Buy this album and enjoy.
0790729628|5.0|What would you do if God was in the room down the hall?  If you were dying, would you go talk to your creator?  What would you do when he tells  you that he is unable to fix you, and more than that, he's just a mortal  himself?  In Blade Runner, the real hero is Roy Batty.  He's done  &quot;questionable things,&quot; yet he reveals a humanity no other  character in the movie has.  He, like all the other replicants, (it doesn't  even matter if Deckard is a replicant) is truly &quot;more human than  human.&quot;  If nothing else, the one truth that you should take away from  this film is that all life, like memory, is precious, fragile, and  fleeting.
B00000IN5G|3.0|I bought this album because these days I love heavy metal music. This album was quite good, but I expected a little more. Because this is Finnish  band (and I'm from there) I hope that they will get popular  worldwidely.<br />First song &quot;Warheart&quot; was quite good. It had  better lyrics than the other songs, but music was more lame. &quot;Silent  Night, Bodom Night&quot; is by Kimberly Goss and I now that she's good  song-writor. Well, I quess this was quite good... But I expected very much  more! &quot;Bed of Razors&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot; and &quot;Wrath  Within&quot; are quite good. Very good actually... &quot;Children of  Bodom&quot; is a song that you have to listen if you haven't heard of this  band. Why? Because that is exactly the kind of music these men are playing.  But the best is coming... &quot;Downfall!&quot; That song is very melody  and Alexi sings well. In other songs his voice sounds like he would only  shout, but here his &quot;shouting&quot; has got melodies and rhytms in it.  Great ending for good album!<br />Okay, this album was good. The real Bodom  Lake is in here Finland and I probably will visit there. This is very  energy music. But if you have headache, this'll only make it worse!
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney Spears cannot sing, first and foremost. If anyone says she can, must be hearing impaired. This young lady got into the music industry by  sucking up and showing every part of her body she could get away with. I do  not understand why she was ever nominated for best New Artist at the  Grammy's because she cannot sing. If she would have won, I would think that  the judges were brain dead. Listening to her new album, I made sure I had  an open mind. After hearing her songs I knew that there had to be another  reason why she even had an album out on the market. Britney is a very  pretty girl and she can dance, but she does not need to be wasting the  music industry's time with her weak voice. She should be a dancer, not a  singer. If you like someone who looks good and cannot sing, Britney is your  girl. If you like real music, with real strong vocals, don't buy this  album. She was correct naming her album, Opps... I did it again, because it  is bad just like the first one.
0440539811|3.0|This was fuel for my discordian high school thoughts.  Fun and enjoyable.
B0000024SI|5.0|Arguably the single most important record released in the 60s, even moreso than that other cultural icon SGT PEPPER - although my personal opinion is divided on the matter (I lean more toward The Beatles on these two albums,  though overall The Beatles and Dylan are equal for their body of work in  the 1960s.).<br />You cannot discuss Bob Dylan without his only artistic  contemporaries, The Beatles.  Both started in relatively the same time, but  Dylan sung fold and The Beatles bubble-gum pop.  In this manner, Dylan has  a much more satisfying early start than does The Beatles.  You don't have  to wade thru a pop phase like with The Beatles.  But The Beatles, of  course, are the single most important band in rock'n'roll, and Bob Dylan  the single most important artist other than The Beatles.   <br />That being  said, Dylan began rocking in a much more satisfying manner than when The  Beatles began.  Their influence over each other is amazing, and because of  this both owe a great debt to one another.  Dylan got The Beatles doing  much more interesting things than the bubble-gum pop of &quot;I Want to  Hold Your Hand,&quot; and their first four albums.  On Help! they had three  or four songs more introverted.  Then, the full-fledged effect of Dylan  over them became apparent when they released RUBBER SOUL in December 3  (they also released the single Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out the same  day). Yet the effects of The Beatles, who encouraged Dylan to move beyond  folk into rock'n'roll on this album, which is his first full-fledged rock  album.  (Some will say that title belongs to BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME, but  that is only half - it straddles his folk and rock, whilst this falls into  the rock).  This album Bob Dylan released August 30, 1965 - and without The  Beatles this might not have happened.  Both of them show their influences  on the other within a mere four months (although both HELP! and BRINGING IT  ALL BACK HOME points to the direction both are moving,though Dylan's  moreso.  Dylan's record beats HELP! in quality by a long shot, although the  two or three best songs on HELP! give the Dylan songs a run for their money  - and that is primarily because they are like Dylan.) <br />As for his voice,  it is one of those things that it actually is a part of his quality that  Bob Dylan can't sing at all.  That is one of the things that adds to his  charm and importance, because it proved that a singer with an  unconventional voice can make it.  Dylan obviously gave no import to music  theory, and with this further defiance he helped pave the way for other  singers who have good voices, though not in a technical sense.  (Really,  who could sing &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; or his smash single  &quot;Positively Fourth Strength&quot;?)  Its like a Faulkner novel - it  just wouldn't be what it was without Faulkner's style - in this case,  Dylan's voice.<br />The songs are absolutely fantastic.  The ride starts on  the epic &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, the first six minute single to  hit number one, breaking the code of three minute songs.  In length, this  would be the necessary forerunner to Don McClean's number one hit  &quot;American Pie&quot;, which have numerous references to Dylan (most  notable when the jester takes the crown, and he sings with a voice that  comes from me and you - Dylan's voice is notorious).  Then it travels onto  &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot;, flat-out garage rock, &quot;It Takes A Lot to  Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot; bluesy material.  &quot;Like Tomb  Thumb's Blues&quot; and &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot; absolutely  brilliant songs.  &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot; is one of my favorite  Dylan songs (it earning an honourable mention in &quot;Yer Blues&quot; off  THE WHITE ALBUM).  The two weakest songs, in my opinion, are the title  track and &quot;From a Buick Six&quot;.  They seem forgetable to me, at  least Buick does.  &quot;Highway 61 Revisted&quot; is, like &quot;Tombstone  Blues&quot;, flat-out garage rock, but is not as good.  But it does  contribute to the overall feel to the album.<br />The one song I have left out  would be the last - Desolation Row.  HIGHWAY 61 REVISTED begins with an  epic and ends likewise.  An eleven minute closer that is folk rock, a  surrealistic poem with nonsense imagery, and an incredibly addicting tune.   <br />&quot;Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood -- With his memories in a trunk  -- Passed this way an hour ago -- With his friend, a jealous monk -- He  looked so immaculately frightful -- As he bummed a cigarette -- Then he  went off sniffing drainpipes -- And reciting the alphabet -- Now you would  not think to look at him -- But he was famous long ago -- For playing the  electric violin -- On Desolation Row&quot;<br />This song will be with me for  a very long time.  It blows anything that Morrison wrote away.  The sense  of rhythm Bob Dylan carries with this song is incredible, allowing his  outstanding song-writing abilities to shine.<br />If you want to discover the  history of our culture during the sixties, this is one record you need to  buy, along with SGT PEPPER and several others.  Excellent music.

B00000FYIL|5.0|It's great. I knew this movie deserved to be nomminated by academy awards in the BEST SCORE category at the very first time I saw it. I can even say that its score is better than the movie. Some of its tracks is  unforgetable.
0812550706|5.0|Here's the deal with Ender's Game:  it's the best novel I've ever read.  There are probably some out there with more literary prowess, or more depth of characters and plot, but for the total picture, and a book that you  really can sit down and read the whole thing in one sitting, Ender's Game  tops them all.   I read it for this first time when I was about 12 - not  unlike thousands of others.  Since then - I'm now 25 - I've reread it every  few years, and each time the story means something more, and different to  me.  As with all other Card stories (I've read them all), this really tells  a story about the human condition (although perhaps not quite as much as  the later books in the 'series').  This one happens to be wrapped around  and through a really fun story about a Fantasy game and a Battle room.  As  one grows and experiences life, there is more to take away from this novel.   I guess I'll have to see if the pattern holds true as I continue to get  older and, hopefully, wiser.
0345423496|3.0|There's nothing I enjoy more on a Saturday morning than a Friday night pizza. Somehow it manages to satisfy some base need. Maybe it's the nomadic sense that I'm foraging for food. &quot;3001: The Final Odyssey&quot; is  the cool leftovers from an intense evening before.<br />That said, I wasn't  expecting anything particularly profound. I wanted to finish the series and  'see what happens.' No car chases, no lewd or baudy scenes. And while I get  the distinct impression - from the notes in the back of the book -  that  Mr. Clarke is beginning a new genre: the pre-historical novel, I enjoyed  the read. He absolutely makes clear what the future is like: the world is a  kindergarten class on Ritalin. One can have fun imagining what we only do  in our dreams, and in that respect the book offers some fresh ideas. The  novel is a reflection of what life is like: it's a lot less interesting and  romantic...it usually plods along with a couple of punctuations for  flavour. Is it the best A.C. Clarke book ever written? No. Is it A.C.  Clarke? Most definitely. Should you read it? Hey, it costs less than a  movie and is better than most of what's out there on film.
B000002UZ4|5.0|I never really realized how many songs of the Pet Shop Boys I love. Until I found this album, its amazing. Every single song is a masterpiece and  satisfies my taste in music. Something that is actually pretty hard to do.  All the songs have such an infectuous vibe, its just phenomenal. My faves  are (I still cant believe that I gotta say so much here): Suburbia, West  End Girls, Always on my mind, So hard, Domino Dancing,Being Boring, What  have I done to deserve this, Opportunities, Where the streest have no name  and Its a sin. The voice of the lead singer is just phenomenal and so  soft, great. Not that I am generally an &quot;always&quot; soft guy (I  dont care if someone else is, though). But still it really satisfies my  softer side. The lyrics of the songs here are also very intelligent and  they really fit even if its mainly dance music. Bravo!

B000002MG1|5.0|No, I don't mean the music, I mean the praise. Okay, there's always going to be some people who don't like this album, that's their problem, but for  most people this is R.E.M.'s best album they've done and one of the best  albums of the twentieth century. I heard &quot;Nightswimming&quot; on the  radio one night and thought it was the most beautiful song I'd ever heard.  I also recognised Michael Stipe's definitive vocals from &quot;Out of  Time&quot;. About a year later, having become a fan of R.E.M. after  listening to one album (&quot;Out of Time&quot;), I was trying to decide  what to buy next. Whatever it was also had to be on cassette, because I  didn't have a portable CD player (still don't). At the back of my mind,  whenever I was in a music store, was to look out for the name  &quot;Nightswimming&quot; on the back of any R.E.M. CD I looked at. When I  spotted it on the back of &quot;Automatic For The People&quot;, my heard  leapt, and I immediately searched for the cassette version, and by God,  there it was, amongst &quot;Out of Time&quot; and &quot;Up&quot;, the only  other R.E.M. albums I've seen on tape so far. &quot;Drive&quot; is a  wonderful start to the album, I remember liking it when I first heard it. I  can't say I found &quot;Try Not To Breathe&quot; as enjoyable the first  time around, but then that could be said about my opinion of several songs  at that time. I greatly enjoyed &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot;,  and after I got hold of the lyrics, I decided it had my favourite verse of  a song of all time in it (the &quot;instant soup&quot; one). I'd heard  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; quite a few times on the radio, enough to enjoy  it while it was on, but amazingly I hadn't realised until now that it was  R.E.M. who wrote and sang it! Whilst &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; is a great  song (although I can imagine some people finding it irritating if it was  played too often, as is the way with music), I still don't believe it is  the best song on the album. By now, things were going well, I'd had three  brilliant songs and one okayish. Next came &quot;New Orleans Instrumental  No.1&quot;, which I've heard described as not as good as the other songs,  but I can't find anything wrong with it. It was a short little piece with  enough variations of a theme to keep you interested the whole way through.  Following that was &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;, a lovely and peaceful  melody which I rewound straight after listening to it. The second side of  the tape was where it all started going wrong until  &quot;Nightswimming&quot;. I found &quot;Monty Got A Raw Deal&quot; fine,  but then my mind started wondering when listening to &quot;Ignoreland&quot;  and &quot;Star Me Kitten&quot;, a sure sign that they couldn't hold my  attention. I quickly focussed when &quot;Man On The Moon&quot; started,  because one of my friends told me it was his favourite R.E.M. songs. To be  frank, I was disappointed. I don't know what I expected, but it just didn't  seem to strike a chord with me the way &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; and  &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; did. Then came the time for  &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, and I remember my heart thumping before it  started, as I still wasn't sure if it was the one I'd heard on the radio  more than a year ago. Fortunately it was the right one, and to this day I  still think it's one of my favourite songs ever. I suppose I have a soft  spot for the piano when it comes to music, as &quot;Tongue&quot; from the  next album &quot;Monster&quot; is one of my favourites of that record, and  it also uses the piano. After &quot;Nightswimming&quot; came &quot;Find The  River&quot;, and again, I lost attention, and didn't find it very exciting.  Of course, I disciplined myself to listen to the album a second time, and  found myself enjoying the songs on the second side much more. I think that  is what happens with a lot of people who listen to this album. Anybody who  hasn't gotit, I advise you to, and if you're slightly disappointed the  first time round, please please please try again, because you're really  missing out. It's worth buying if only for &quot;Nightswimming&quot; in my  view.
039472903X|3.0|While there was some interesting iformation, I found it to be contradictory and rather dated.  Ogilvy states 90% of consumers don't read ad copy.  He then gives the impression that THE most important piece of  information in the ad is its headline.  Yet, what is Ogilvy know for...85  million words in his copy.  This book was also written 20 years ago.  Thus,  the stats provided are dated.  He informs the reader of the importance of  research...well, duh.  His writing style was arrogant...every opportunity  available he cited awards won, compliments given, people he met and who  idiolized him.  He even put a picture of his mansion in the book...see how  much money I made.  So far the most valuable pieces of info I've read was a  1946 typed memo from Leo Burnett discussing the importance of humility and  Leo's infamous &quot;When to take my name off the door&quot; speach.
B000002LOE|5.0|Until around the age of 13 1/4, I had never been really interested in modern music like rock and pop. There were the odd songs that I heard on the radio which made me think &quot;That's nice, I hope they play it again  sometime&quot; then forget about them. Then one day I pulled a tape out of  the player in my mum's car and saw it was the one we used to listen to in  the car on the way to and from school when I was young. I had the wonderful  feeling of nostalgia as I listened to the whole thing on my Walkman, and I  made an effort to listen to this album every single day. My favourite song  on this album is &quot;Half A World Away&quot;, with &quot;Losing My  Religion&quot; coming joint second with &quot;Country  Feedback&quot;...Well, I like all of the songs as much as each other,  although for a while I got into the habit of fast-forwarding through  &quot;Belong&quot; and &quot;Texakarna&quot;, but now I like them both.  &quot;Out of Time&quot; was the album that influenced me enough to start  buying new R.E.M. albums like &quot;Automatic For The People&quot;,  &quot;Murmur&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot;, none of which have dissapointed  me. &quot;Out of Time&quot; has something for everyone in it, whether it's  &quot;Country Feedback&quot; for a depressed reject (like me) or  &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot; for a shiny happy person. It was also thanks  to &quot;Out of Time&quot; that I began rooting through the house and found  other &quot;car&quot; tapes like Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Born In The  USA&quot; and &quot;Eurythmics Greatest Hits&quot;. I really can't fault  this album, every song is inspiring and displays the wonderful writing  skills of Michael Stipe and co. However, if a heavy rocking album is what  you're after, I'd stay away from R.E.M. in general, apart from perhaps  &quot;Monster&quot;. Out of Time is for people who have varieties of  tastes, people who enjoy a gentle ride through a wide range of textures and  instruments. If you like this album, I urge you to buy &quot;Automatic For  The People&quot;. It took me a while to get used to it, but now I rate it  as one of the best albums of the twentieth century (and I'm not being  melodramatic, I mean it).
6304401736|5.0|101 DALMATIANS is one of Disney's most adored animated masterpieces, and has been embrased by dog lovers around thew world.  So the stuido needed to  make sure that this live-action adaptation followed in it's footsteps--er,  sorry, PAWprints.  But they didn't have to worry--this has all the elements  of a good live-action comedy, while not streching itself too far away from  the goodness of animated.  Glen Close is a devilish Cruella...Disney  couldn't have picked someone better for the role.  While it can be a bit  scary for the youngest viewers, it's very entertaining and has just enough  power to make you get goosebumps when she has screen time while not scaring  you completly so you turn the video off--a little scare is refreshing now  and then.  While it doesn't have the animated characters, Disney is limited  in what they can have the puppies do to escape--but where there lacks the  power of anamation, there comes the power of comedy.  There's always some  zany way for the escape to happen--and there's also one more important  element: the stupidity of Horrace and Jasper (Cruella's bumbeling  henchmen.)<br />To sum it up: While this is a little bit different from the  animated classic we all remember, it's still got the spirit--and it's very  much worthwhile to dog lovers, although I don't know how much certoam cat  fatanatics will enjoy this.....  ;O) (HIGHLY RECOMENDED.  Essensial to any  family's collection, this is something everyone can enjoy...unless, of  course, you purrrrrfer cats and kittens.)
0812932293|5.0|Losing My Virginity is one of the most captivating, enjoyable, and surprising autobiographies I've read. Whether or not you have followed Virgin's (and Branson's) success, this book is definitely a worthwhile read  - both for the content and for the style. From the age of 17, Branson shows  how his adventuresome nature, competitive spirit, and pure drive (in  addition, of course, to a more than fair share of good luck) have helped  him succeed. And unless you've followed his life closely, you'll be  surprised at just how many business areas he's had his fingers in. From  aiding in the success of the Sex Pistols, to launching Virgin Cola  Atlantic, and Brides, Branson has seemingly done it all.  It's a great  story and an enthralling read.

6305627401|5.0|Welcome to the &quot;peaceful&quot; town of South Park. It's just another  quiet morning when the boys sneak into the &quot;Terrance and Phillip&quot;  movie and pick up a new... uh, &quot;Handle&quot; on the english langauge.   Afterwards, Kyle's mother declares war on Canada in way of revenge for the  boy's foul mouths, and with typical South Park humor... no-one is spared  it's brunt!<br />This includes Saddam Hussein turning Satan into his personal  love toy, Kenny's death (what a surprise), The V-chip (installed into Eric  Cartman, the worst one of the bunch), and as a computer nut, my personal  favorite... the death of Bill Gates (maybe someday he'll get an O/S right  on the FIRST try)!<br />Picture South Park the series without the censors  reigning them in... and you have &quot;Bigger, longer and uncut&quot;!

We hear all the time about the dirty 30's  and all the hard times (like walking 3 miles to school uphill in a raging  blizzard) but this really makes a person appreciate what these people must  have gone through.  The story tended to move slowly, but that let the  reader get to know the Joad family well, especially young Tom Joad.  They  managed to make do with very little in the way of money or food and yet  wouldn't hesitate to share what they had with someone else.  It makes a  person feel kind of ashamed to think we look into a full refrigerator and  still think there's nothing to eat.  I was hoping the story would end with  a happy Joad family finding a home and work, but that was left up to the  reader's imagination.  I don't know if John Steinbeck just got tired of  writing or what, but the ending left a little to be desired.  I was sure  they would meet up with their son again, but that probably wasn't a  realistic look at how it most likely was then.  The book will definitely  make me think differently about migrant workers that come into our area.  Things may not be quite as bad now as back then, but they probably face  many of the same circumstances.

It also has marginally better guitar work than most of what he's put out. But what  I think makes this album so effective is how pretty much everyone can  relate to experiences expressed by the boss in these songs, and even though  there are still many refrences to cars and what not, it's a very emotional  and powerful album. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in  Springsteen.
B000006NPY|5.0|You can measure the intelligence of a music fan by how strongly they react to this album. If they rage against it and decry the Pumpkins for trying new sounds, they are simple-minded listeners who crave repition; if they  embrace the new venture of the Pumpkins' music, they are open-minded and  intelligent.<br />This is a great album, and it doesn't have to sound exactly  like your favorite SP albums from the past, to be great. If you're stuck in  the past and want the same old from this band, you're going to be  disappointed. Smashing Pumpkins are about risk, edge, daring, and  innovativeness. They aren't gonna do &quot;Siamese DReam&quot; and  &quot;Mellon-Collie&quot; till the day they die. <br />THe songs on this album  are totally up to the Pumpkins standard--great lyrics, tune, and  orginality. &quot;Ava Adore&quot; and &quot;Perfect&quot; are the standout  rockers, &quot;For Martha&quot; and &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; are quiet  songs that will make your heart stop. <br />This album is gorgeous, beautiful,  and above all--original. Kudos to Billy Corgan for taking a great risk.  <br />Screw off, to all the poseurs with simple minds.
0792846443|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.  It is very intense and for anyone who likes Drama movies THIS ONE IS FOR YOU.  Kathy Bates  plays Annie Wilks and meets her favorite Author who was in a wreck and she  saved his life and brought him to her home.  He gets better each day and  finally Annie decides she wants him to stay.  I highly recommend  this  movie for mature viewers and once you finally see this Masterpiece you  might understand what I mean when I say &quot;She wants him to stay&quot;.
B000023VR6|3.0|I'll keep it short. Dre is surely the god of Hip Hop, but I've expected a little more. The Songs are produced perfectly, no1 does it like Dre, but something is missing. I dont unnderstand why the words &quot;Dre&quot;  &quot;the chronic&quot; and so on can be heard a billion times on this CD.  We know that you're the greatest Dre, You dont have to  say it again and  again! The CD is good, but I'll rather listen to Slim Shadys new CD, where  Dre does what he can best...produce!
