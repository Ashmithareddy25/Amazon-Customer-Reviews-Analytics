B00ABKGG0C|4|Very good read.  Conanesque, but with deeper character development
1416594884|4|My book club made this title our selection and I was excited about reading his latest tale. I downloaded it to my Kindle and I was off...loved all the characters and the plotting. Le Carre's prose is sublime. A yarn spun about terrorism and its witting and unwitting subjects. I loved it and then it was suddenly over, in a kind of shaggy dog fashion...I wanted it to go on but alas Le Carre' put down his pen and sent it off to his publisher. A very good read that pulls up short at the end ,but still worthwhile. Next Book Club selection; Rabbit Run.
B008Q08EV8|2|Slow developing. - predictable ending
B00COHIFQS|4|The movie was somewhat a new plot for a horror movie.  There were moments my wife somewhat was startled.  The movie was filmed in surprising good quality and had a rather surprising ending.  All in all, the movie kept our attention and was good entertainment for the money.
B00000J2PH|5|Great to listen to Carole King when you really want to relax. Her songs are rich in descriptive lyrics. At times I find myself singing with Carole, especially with, &#34;You Got a Friend In Me.&#34;  A must have Cd.
B008Y1YK0I|5|I have never seen picture quality this good. Period. If you love this movie then you must see it fully restored.
B002QE3CTY|5|Great book, very captivating. Would highly recommend these books, I read one right after the other. It is about a futuristic time as in something that could potentially happen.
B00ESY7QXI|2|Both my wife and I couldn't believe we disliked it as much as we did.  They ruined a famous classic.
B001CDWFPC|2|This review specifically covers the Kindle edition of the ESV Bible.  In short, there's good reason why the Kindle version is only a quarter of the price of the hardcover edition.      In the print edition, notes are at the bottom of the page and cross-references are in the margin.  Sprinkled throughout are drawings and other supplements, and maps are at the back of the book.  There are also lengthy chapters on translation techniques, languages, etc.    With the Kindle version, there are no cross-references... period.  The passage notes are there, but you have to access a completely different screen to get to them.  This is more than just clunky: it defeats the flow of reading a passage, glancing at a given note, and then returning to reading the passage.  With the Kindle version, you can read the passage or you can read the notes - take your pick.      The wonderful maps in the print edition are technically available in the Kindle, but they're virtually unreadable even after zooming in as much as possible.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's a bit of a pain locating a specific verse.  I've found it easiest to use the \\"go to\\" feature to pick the table of contents, then select the book, then the chapter, then page forward to the specific verse you want.  It's a bunch of steps and a bit slow, but not awful once you get used to it.  I've found the search feature to be pretty lame - you get page after page of hits on your search, but it's very difficult to tell where the hit is located.  You can't narrow the search to one book, so you get hits throughout the entire Bible and the notes section as well with pretty limited ability to tell which is which.      One positive note: I've read other posts about the Kindle version taking hours to download.  Mine downloaded in about 10 minutes with no trouble at all.      Would I buy it again?  Well... probably.  The price is no higher than several other Bible translations available on the Kindle that don't include the notes or maps or other learning aids.  But don't make the mistake that you're getting all the features of the hardcover for a Kindle-version price - you're definitely not.

B007IXWKUK|5|Great book! I'm so happy they are going to get married. I didn't think they would last! Ready for the next one!
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Enjoyed Angelina Jolie in this movie, she came across very well in this type of film.
014242417X|5|I positively absolutely totally freaking loved this amazing and wonderful book. One of the best books I have ever read!
B00PTB7B34|5|I love Call Of Duty so when I saw this game I had to try it.
B001KQZ7I8|5|I have struggled daily with my meaning for the future when at 82 years I seem less important and interesting to those I encounter. I have decided that if I only listen to others, they do not directly appreciate that act, but they sometimes seek me out to express themselves more openly. I decided that had sufficient value to suffer another day. I found many stranger like to return I smile. This book has assuaged my doubts and solidified my beliefs for which I am most appreciative.
0385341679|5|A Fitting end to the 'FEVER' series - it was worth every minute of the wait.  I will truly, truly miss the characters from this series, but it speaks to how strong of a character writer this author is.  Thank you, Karen Marie Moning, from the bottom of my heart. I am an avid fiction reader, and your FEVER series is the handsdown reason you are my favorite author.
B004LWZW4W|5|Anyone Who has seen this Movie! U Know it was very good, But!! To own it<br />On Blu-Ray it's the Best way to Watch it'<br />And if u have Prime! Then you'll have it<br />In 2, Days. Amazon Prime!! Is the Best way to Go.
B0052RDHTM|5|The Fall of Giants was a fabulous story, strong characters and I can't wait to start the second book which I plan to do almost immediately..
B00435WX7G|4|very fun to put together the only annoying thing is all the stickers you will have to put on
B008NCSZQ8|5|Fast paced action, true to the comic book story. Very good visual effects and sound effects. Pure enjoyment for any age.
B000FA5SMK|5|Reads as if you were having a beer on the porch listening to a great detective story with the twists and turns of a classic tale of who dun it
B00992CF6W|1|Version 5.0 is out in the apple stores and even though we paid the same price as them they still get it first. yoi are one shelfish company notch.
B00GIZO674|5|Fun little game. Goes well with the series of little games that you can make food and occupies time for long road trips.
B009KS4XRO|5|It works well on my Kindle and I am very pleased with the performance. Looking forward to playing Bingo Blitz on the Kindle!
0345525558|4|I like the book - no time for a critique . . . I won't be reviewing anything in the future as you require too much information
B00AC8ZJPQ|2|This got off much to slow for my liking I would rather of seen less of the cadets traing and more of the battle with the covenant
B0099RFVXQ|4|Very good actors and good special effects. I'm not the best critical, but I didn't find mistakes in the scene.
B002T9H2LA|1|What a disappointment - the scene in the bar goes on and on and on and on and on. This ain't no Kill Bill. Unfortunately many who watch it will be convinced that Hitler died in a movie theater in Paris.  To see a very well made, pithy \\"movie\\" - check out the new VW ad with Stevie Wonder - now that's creative film making!
B0006L0LOS|5|love this movie!!!
B000YHG72E|5|A newfound Christmas tradition in my house.  This movie is everything you need for a holiday flick.  Right up there with other classics, like The Grinch (the animated version) and Nightmare Before Christmas, in my book.
B00407PNWO|5|As always the best. Good price. Good quality reproduction.
B00FJ313ZY|5|A great book, and very inspiring. Paul proves that if you work hard and stay focused you can do anything you want in life.
B007AL48UK|4|I'm not sure of the rules of Mahjong..but I seem to be able to do ok so far, very relaxing , I usually p'll at a bowling game I have to unwind before bed, now I play this, even the colours are relaxing, I can't wait to buy the Fall Mahjong.
B00F35BV64|5|Loved it did not see any if the twist coming. Hope to see more Star Trek movies in the future.
B00K0OI42W|5|I had never read this book. A classic without question. Everyone should be sure to read it. Well done, well done.
B00C1BUYX4|1|The Movie Is Not About Lincoln. It is about Amendment 13 to the constitution. Should of been documentary. Very disappointing. I love Daniel Day-Lewis and his movies, but this is not &#34;My left foot&#34;.
B00BRUYQFC|5|This is Justin Timberlake's best album yet.  Keep them coming.  I love having the music on my phone anytime I want to hear it.
B000002UAX|1|The White Album at one time was great.   <br /> <br />But grow up people, it is 2005, this album is a relic, not a classic.
B005MLOKXA|5|cant wait to get home to watch it I love it thanks!!!!!
B00ET9T2WK|5|I had it for my Iphone and I couldn't wait for it to come out on the kindle. My life is now complete :)
0375836675|5|Captures the reader from the first sentence. Journey of why this man keeps getting cards,are they messages, pieces of a puzzle bow do they fit<br />Enjoyed
B00H7Y9CKG|4|this is a great game. My only complaint is that it freezes up once in a while. would have given five stars other than that.
B007AJFSJW|5|I was a conservative until the 2008 financial collapse. I have read Warren, Stiglitz, Lewis, Stockman, Barofsky and others and have concluded that the political right is in it for themselves and don't care about the average person or his or her pension, etc. I taught Securities in a law school for over thirty years. In Merrill's book Critiquing Krugman he never satisfactorily refutes the basic thought that &#34;If the government spends more, unemployment will be reduced.&#34;  My Econ 101 course does not permit me to say how much spending will produce how much of a reduction in unemployment but I need a lot of convincing to refute what to me is apparent. Nor am I equipped to say how much spending will increase tax revenue to the point of decreasing the national debt but I am pretty sure it will to some degree. I see some very strong correlation between the point of this book and Stiglitz's book on Inequality.<br />We can blame Boards of Directors, cult figures and others for this but the ultimate authority lies with the voter and the ticket buyer and until the decide that they want to take their society back nothing will change.

1582701709|1|On page 111 under Secret Summaries I found a very practical Secret, \\"Visualize checks in the mail\\". I thought I had better try this. It could get me out under from all that hard negativity, you know, don't spend too much and invest, or suffer the consequences. I applied the unfathomable power of my mind (the Secret is that I have got it too) with great intensity to create at least one unexpected check in the mail. But the result of my experiment, in the power of positive thinking, was negative. No check in the mail. I wonder if anyone else with a more powerful positive mind has done this experiment and generated a positive result? In my case I found that Quantum physics does not work on mailmen and  envelopes (those items are just too big I think).     Also this book does not have an index; that makes it difficult to research it to find out what I might have done wrong in my thought experiment. But I hate to end on such a negative note about a work that is all about being positive, so I will add that the cover is attractive, that is, it does attract the eye from a distance.
B007W8S2MG|5|I am a Persona fanatic. I love all things that come from Atlus, but this series is by far one of the best. (Of course, Devil Survivor is also good!) Persona 4 Golden is a really great remake of the PS2 version. I specifically purchased a PS Vita for this game. I even pre-ordered P4G before I even had the Vita itself. One of my only complaints about the remake is that they changed Chie's voice, which I adored in the original game. Now she sounds nasally or like she has a cold all the time.<br /><br />The added features are really great. I like that I can go onto the game and listen to the soundtrack if I want. I also find the other additional features, like the TV show stuff, to be entertaining. Being able to fast-forward is also helpful if, like me, you've already played the original. I admit that sometimes watching the same stuff multiple times can be annoying.<br /><br />I also like how they added a new character, and that you can explore the town the moment you get there. The graphics are also pretty flawless for this remake. If you are a Persona fan, this is a must have for your collection. It is definitely worth the money, and, in my opinion, buying a Vita for.
B008RA3X5E|1|I installed this on my phone (Motorola Razr m) yesterday.  I always charge my phone overnight and have only went into &#34;low battery&#34; twice since I've owned my phone; and never in a single day.  This morning I disconnected phone from charger and went about my business.  Right after lunch my phone started beeping the &#34;low battery&#34; warning.  I thought, &#34;What???&#34;  I hadn't even used my phone except for a 10 minute call all morning.  When I looked at the battery usage info My Alarm Clock had used up 68 % of my battery!  I hadn't even opened or used the app yet!  I really wanted to try this to replace my stock alarm... but there's no way I can have this app eating a ridiculous amount of battery in a short amount of time, especially when I hadn't even used it yet!  Uninstalled.  It's a shame because I really wanted to like this.
B00936A0RU|5|Love it
B00NM7K7NI|3|Good story.
B00KG2RI9I|5|Great movie
B001NEK2GE|3|I enjoy using my Logitech G13 when playing first person shooters, but I find that mice like the Venus or Naga are better suited for people that want additional keys. Sometimes you cannot beat a standard keyboard and mouse. The palm and wrist rest are VERY comfortable. I would suggest anyone with carpal tunnel to look into this peripheral.
0440246318|5|the story is so consuming could not put it down love Jack cannot wait for the next one Thank you Lee Child
0679890475|5|Great value.
B0007TKNIS|5|For all the people in the world who would never have been able to see Phantom of the Opera except for this fabulous movie let me just say that you have seen the best part of it.  The stage version and the Opera singing were really not as moving as the film version.  I watched it many times and I am so moved by the charactors and music every time.  The movie has more depth and is much better than paying $200.00 for a ticket to see it on Broadway and then not having it to watch again.  Believe me, the movie is awsome and worth owning.

B007VUA7VO|5|thank u so much u are really. helping my situation by giving me another means of communication with our home phone down and 1 cell this app has been great
B00002MZ2C|1|Ok, first off I just wanna say there's nothing wrong with rock music that has political messages or overtones in it. U2 is one of my favourite bands of all time and their music has a lot of political references. But RATM  doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Their music stinks worse than that  leftover christmas ham you find shoved in the back of your 'fridge around  February, and their lyrics(the audible ones) are pointless and tiring. What  are these guys trying to say? Do they mean anything with their messages, or  just get rich in this country while going around burning the American flag?  I mean ..who are these guys' influences...Marx, Lenin, Castro? As for their  music style, they need go buy the new Beastie Boys box set if they want  REAL rock/rap.
B00HY7VU60|5|Absolutely amazing series.  I recommend it highly, especially if you enjoy historical fiction like The Tudors, The Borgias, etc
1451627289|1|A world is created in which time travel is possible and the only thing the author wants to change is the assassination of John F. Kennedy????
B00HY7VU60|5|Loved it!
B002MQYOFW|4|It was an easy to get through read, leaving me wanting a little bit more at the end. Excited to see what happens next.
B000AYEL6U|5|I chose five stars because North and South is an amazing mini-series! Richard Armitage is an amazing actor, and Daniela Denby-Ashe was a fantastic (the best) pick for Margarete Hale. It is captivating. I recommend! I love this mini-series.
B008JFLWLE|5|This is great. Admittedly I haven't tried a whole lot of formulas but the ones I tried left a good WOW factor.
B00DV2D0JC|4|I have played this on pc and kindle fire hd 7 inch....Great game.
B0000VCZKM|4|Fun for the whole family!
B006LSZECO|1|The ending ruins it.  I was actually angry at the end and regretful that I put my time into reading it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This book unlike most books used reality as a focal point. It did not create this fake world fantasy that make people wish for reality to be like fantasy. I loved this book it is amazing.
B00B4Z5J92|5|Why did I wait so long to watch this!? Amazing!!!
B008JF8O9M|2|It's neat that I could print from my device, but it was a pain figuring out ways to get it to. Plus, it didn't print correctly. I tried to print a document from Polaris office and it just printed the location across the top first; second attempt it printed the text, but tiny and not as it was in layout... only across top again. Third attempt of a photo it cut off part of it with no option to orient the page (had to print from editor,  not album) and when I tried to do a forth print it said number of free print jobs exhausted,  get pro version. Not user friendly for samsung galaxy tablet and certainly Not a long enough trial to figure it all out! Don't both with this one if you have samsung android. I gave it 2 stars just for fact I could get something to print even though tablet in applications having print button says must have samsung printer.
B0076I624W|5|This is one of our favorite films; a great movie, even greater in HD.  Six more words are required for me to submit this.
B0020BUWX2|3|Did not really care of the memorie Mia was going through.  It should have been more hair raising of what people actually experience.
B00000K2SC|1|This movie is bad, and I don't mean &quot;bad&quot; in the sense of &quot;funky bad&quot; or some kind of negative slang for &quot;good&quot;.  It reeks.  A ridiculous plot, saddled with some of the worst acting in  living memory it stumbles along with dialogue that seems to have been  lifted directly from bad &quot;Friends&quot; episodes.  Every time my eyes  began to glaze over there was some startling special effect to wake me up,  but that's just not enough.  A movie needs to do more than simply keep you  awake.  For those who thought Armageddon and ID4 were good pictures you  won't be disspointed.  For the intelligent human however and especially for  science fiction fans, this movie holds absolutely nothing.
B0009QTS1M|5|Exactly what I thought I was purchasing. Shipped quickly. Definately would recommend this seller.
0425263916|4|This book was great, it was a page turner. I would like to know if theres any more books like this too read.
B00BPDR3F6|4|I've just finished reading this wonderful book, and am still in the midst of its protagonist`s lifelong search for the meaning, the truth about all living things. I will be thinking of this book for a long while.
B00634GHJA|5|I like it. Does what it says. If you have access to WiFi and want quick photo and video transfer, this app is what you need.
0802130208|5|\\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"--Jonathan Swift <br /> <br />     This quote introduces the novel, \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\", and explains the main character's view of the world. Ignatius J. Reilly is what one might call an indignent butthead. No one is smarter than Ignatius, or so he thinks. Anyone that disagrees with what he has to say or does is a fool. Because Ignatius feels this way, virtually everyone in the world is a fool who can't grasp the level of thinking Ignatius's mind reaches. Ignatius lives a virtual bum's life, shacked up (most of the time, at least) in his bedroom of his mother's house.  He is constantly occupied by the lack of taste and decency in the world that surrounds him.  All the while, he claims to be pursuing a writing career, but only writes scraps and pieces of his daily activities and thoughts.  Ignatius constantly degrades and criticizes everyone he comes in contact with, especially his mother. The novel is a comedic piece of work, and the bulk of the laughter one might get from it comes from the conversations Ignatius engages in with the people he knows or meets; in particular, the letters he and ex-girlfriend, Myrna Minkoff, send to one another are quite hilarious.  <br />     Nevertheless, the novel only works because of Ignatius: the portly, overdramatic, under-sexed character most can't help but love and hate at the same time. The other characters, such as Myrna and Ignatius's mother, are all interesting and funny on their own. But they help to solidify one's disdain for Ignatius, and thus their appreciation for the novel. His arrogance and pretentiousness drive the novel and make it a pleasure to read--if one can handle the abomination that is Ignatius J. Reilly, Your Militant Working Boy.

B0063GORYU|3|Does not move as fast as my computer one did and I get frustrated.  I hope it will get easier.
B00CH26TL8|4|Would give 5 stars if it was a bit bigger. But other than that. It's great! Would definitely recommend it.
B000031XCR|2|I really wish I could have rated this higher. But the simple truth is that as a greatest hits album, this was lacking.  <br /> <br />My main reasons for buying this album were \\"The Power of Love,\\" and \\"It's All Coming Back to me.\\" I already own the previous albums that these songs came from, but I thought it would be nice to own them on a single cd. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the songs on this cd were shortened versions.  <br /> <br />If you're just a passing listener who only wants an overall showcase of Dion's carreer, than this cd is fine. It collects a fairly good sampling of her stuff. It has the glaring absentee of \\"All By Myself.\\" Come on! This sucker was played to death on the radio. I think it deserves a spot on a hits album.   <br /> <br />If, however, you really love the music and respect it, you don't want shortened versions of the songs. When you know a song and know it well, like the back of your hand, it can be jarring and disheartening to hear it chopped up and edited like this.  <br /> <br />This is not a slam against Celine. She's a great singer and I've always at the least respected her, if not loved her music. I just can't rate this album high after what it did to my favorite songs. <br />
B00005JKCH|1|I'm sorry, but I hated this film.  So much so that I refuse to see the second one. <br /> <br />Tobey Maguire looks about 12.  He did not convince me that even with super powers he could battle evil.  \\"I did all my own stunts.\\"  Please!  In just about all the action sequences, Spiderman was so cgi that he looked like a slimmed-down Shrek with red spandex on. <br /> <br />The only positive feeling that this film left me with was knowing that I was right in all those school yard debates many years ago:  \\"Who is the better super-hero, Spiderman or Batman?\\"  I was on Batman's side, and this film made me feel all the more justified in my choice. <br /> <br />I felt sorry for Kirsten Dunst.  She's a good actress, and she got stuck with this. <br /> <br />The best thing about it was it had a Nickelback song, and it's to Nickelback that my one lonely star for this film goes to. <br /> <br />Sorry.
B008LV8TSU|4|The movie leaded me to this book, it's a great story with charm! However, it also left me an unsatisfying feeling which is not a good after taste for sure. Not like that I'm not loving this book but it was just... not up to my expectation. It's definitely well developed in the first 2/3, but suddenly came to the end with only a brief touch of all these characters the author had put into the story. The relationship between Howl and Sophie was not quite convincing to me (not like the very interesting \\"friendship\\" between Shopie & Calcifer). Lovely characters and very potential plot I could only hope the story had been longer, with more magic, and details. Besides, I fall hard for Calcifer!!!

B002JCSWVG|5|An essential film to understand how present-day South Africa came about in the mid-1990s. it is recommended to anyone trying to see the difference between Mandela's approach and that of other leaders in the region, who chose confrontation over cooperation after kicking out white minority rulers.<br /><br />Mandela gives us all a great lesson in humanity as well as shrewd politics. This film has the great merit of reminding the world of an episode that would have otherwise been forgotten.
B001GZ6QEC|5|When I first saw Batman Begins, I told my wife, \\" THIS is how they should make Batman.  Finally, someone knows how to make a damn good superhero movie.\\"  And then when I heard about a sequel (in which I am not surprised given the box office hit of the first) and hoped that it does not dissapoint the first movie.  Lo and behold, it did not.  For me, the sequel/Dark Knight is better than its predecessor.  I told my wife again, \\"Now THIS is how they should make sequels, it's that damn good!\\"  Heath's performance is outstanding.  He brings the Joker's character to a whole new level.  The storyline is great, everything is great.  That is why there is no doubt that the Blu Ray/DVD sale of this movie will definitely surpass Iron Man.  This movie is a must have, especially for hidef fanatics like me.

031236198X|3|\\"Our Iceberg Is Melting\\" is a fable which deals with the subjects of change management, human behavior, and team building in similar form as \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\". Some interesting insights may be drawn concerning human behavior - specifically how people react to change, differing personalities, and the challenges that one may encounter when working in a small team environment. There are at least a couple disturbing techniques (at least in my opinion) that encourage crowd behavior and lessen independent thinking. Not my cup of tea but may be a good fit for someone seeking guidance in a corporate environment.
B003CSV7TK|5|Had no problem streaming this and it was the perfect way to spend Christmas. This is the best one by far.
B00CW665VI|5|I love to read books from the POV of the male.  It provides you an interest twist in things.  Now, this novel was just something else!  It was fun, sexy, arrogant, and just with the necessary display of love that makes you swoon.  I just wish I find more books like this.  Excellent book. I don't tend to write reviews but I just had to for this one.  Bravo!
B007AL48UK|5|I've played several mahjong games for Android. This is definitely one of the best. The menus are easy to navigate, the tiles are easy to read and tell apart, the animations are smooth, and there are plenty of tables to play. I'd pay a couple bucks for this game. I got it as the FAotD though.
B00FLML7HW|5|Fantastic value, great gift item
B00ESY77LO|4|I love Moulin Rouge which this movie reminds me of obviously. I'm torn on this one. Visually stunning, but 2/3 way through the movie started to drag for me. I have a feeling I will end up watching it again at some point though.

B00821OX98|4|I like it and i will continue watching it.
B00NX6WZIS|5|Denzel Washington is terrific as Robert McCall and I hope this is the beginning of a series of Equalizer movies.  I loved the TV series back in the 80's and this was written to portray the essence of the original TV series.  Denzel is one of the best actors today and always enjoy his performances.  Warning:  If you are squeamish at all, some scenes are very graphic, so be forewarned. Chloe Grace Moretz as Teri is also wonderful and I only wish she had a larger role.

B002R88G5E|5|I hadn't read the Kite Runner but had been recommended this book when I was looking to get it. I use the word engaging as a way to describe it for a few reasons: It is a page turner and you feel connected and concerned for the main characters; it is a tough read that is quite harrowing at times but the spirit of the main characters carries you through. I would happily recommend it and have already.
B009NQKPUW|4|If you like the Alien movies, you might like this.  While it wasn't as intense as the others, it does provide a background as to where the monsters came from.  Throw in a space ship, space travel, exploring a new planet and, of course, creatures, it is good.  Not great, but good.<br /><br />The 3D is good, while not exploiting it.  Since I just got my first 3D TV, I would like a movie that does take it to the limit!  I expected 3D to be gimmicky.  What I discovered is it is natural and 2D is dull!  After all, we have two eyes, so we see in 3D.<br /><br />This doesn't come close to Aliens, but I enjoyed it.
B008K8VDPU|5|This game is good and helps you learn. I'm glad it was free if not I would have begged and begged for it. Very Good. You can look up any song. Needs WiFi to look up songs. But if you know some to play without or with WiFi than you're set. Get this game.

B005DD7H50|2|this film has a ton of good reviews & i am, generally speaking, in agreement with the masses on action flicks. this is the exception. the first 15 minutes are pretty darn good, but after that the plot begins to fray at the edges - and eventually, it comes apart. perhaps the issue (for me) is that there is very little character development for any of the supporting roles? the lack of resolution to what would seem to be pretty major events? the vast leap in direction in the last few minutes? or the totally anti-climatic ending? likley a bit of all.     this would be a great series for one of the networks to pick up...and if a writer were to follow all of the heretofore unpursued angles presented in the film? i betcha they'd get an easy 2 or 3 seasons out of it without searching for new ideas.     no. i wouldn't recommend this film. as excited as i was to see it - it was a let down. but a whole lot of other folks liked it...
B008Q00OZM|5|Loved this Movie. I know to some it might seems corny and dumb, but it was funny and with no vulgarity and useless gruesome murder scenes.<br />With a delightful ending.
B001OQCV6A|4|DVD was as advertised, like new, and delivered in a timely manner.  Love this movie!  If you have read Sherlock Holmes, you will love this movie!  It is great to see that the movie pegged him almost to a T!  Boxing, drugs, black moods, experiments, make-up, seeing all the little details that we mere mortals look at but do not see; terrific!  If you have not read Shirlock Holmes, you might be wondering why this is not like the proper English man played by Basil Rothbone.  This is more upbeat, more lively, more the way I see it played out when reading Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  And, as a plus, you can actually see what is going on, unlike the old black and white shows with all the fog!

0393312836|5|Brilliant. Better than Kubrick could have ever portrayed, then again he was dealing with the version that was missing the 21st chapter that was released here in America. An entire chapter that is the resolution to the entire plot and climax to the protagonist's struggle. Definitely a must read!
B008XG1X18|5|I resisted joining Pinterest for a long time because I thought it was just another dumb internet thing. I am glad that I finally checked it out because I can literally kill hours and hours on there. It is really neat and worth while.
B00005RYKV|4|Takeshi knows his crime drama and this film, while not as thoughtful as Fireworks, is stunning.  If you enjoy a different style of pacing and characters with character then his movies are up your alley.  Violent and then peaceful, Brother is more a work of art than just a yakuza film.
B003JTHXOK|4|I really liked this book. It isn't the best book I've ever read, but it did make me realize that I have a great husband!

B000OF0GB4|5|If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.  -  William Blake.    This book, _The Doors of Perception and Heaven and Hell_, first published in 1954, consists of two books written by Aldous Huxley which reveal his investigations into the human mind and human consciousness as well as his experiences with psychedelic substances.  Huxley delves deeply into the experiences of the artists and the mystics as well as the experience of madness and schizophrenia (mimicked he believed by certain states induced through hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD-25).  This book was particularly popular during the 1960s and with the counter-culture.  Aldous Huxley (1894 - 1963) was a British born author and thinker who explored regions of human consciousness, and examined spiritual and mystical experience.  Huxley is perhaps best known for his novel _Brave New World_ which examined the rise of the modern totalitarian and scientifically managed state.  Huxley lived for a time in the United States in southern California where he had dealings with the American Indians there and in New Mexico.  This book offers a study of some of his own experiences with altered states of consciousness induced partially by hallucinogenic drugs and their relationship to the experiences of the artists and mystics.    The first book included in this book is _The Doors of Perception_ (1954) which details Huxley's experiences with the psychedelic and consciousness altering drug mescaline.  The title for this book comes from the poem by William Blake.  To begin with Huxley notes that in 1886, the German pharmacologist Louis Lewin published his study on the cactus Anhalonium Lewinii which has been used extensively by the Indians of the American Southwest.  Huxley relates the experience of the drug to that of schizophrenia and madness as understood by the \\"alienists\\".  Huxley then relates how in 1953 he came to take mescaline and explains the altered states of consciousness it induced.  Huxley relates these experiences to those of the mystics such as Meister Eckhart, the Buddhist concept of the Dharma-Body and Zen Buddhism, Platonic philosophy, as well as the notion of the \\"Mind at Large\\".  Huxley also relates his experiences to those of the artists, such as Vermeer and Cezanne, and to those of musicians such as Mozart.  Huxley explains how the ability to \\"think straight\\" is not altered under the influence of the drug, but how visualization and visual imagery is greatly improved.  Huxley ends by relating his experiences to those of some of the other drugs and the peyote cultists, as well as the angelology of for example St. Thomas Aquinas.    The second book included in this book is _Heaven and Hell_ (1956) which is a philosophical work detailing the relationship between bright colors and the artists as well as psychoactive substances and mystical philosophy.  Huxley examines the \\"antipodes\\" or regions of the mind that can be reached through the use of psychoactive substances, vitamin deficiencies, meditation, self-flagellation, or fasting.  Huxley begins by relating the vast regions of the human mind to be discovered to those of the zoologist and the geographer.  He notes that the mind still has its dark continents like Africa which have yet been discovered.  Huxley relates mystical experiences within Christianity, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam to bright colors found amongst the artists.  In particular, Huxley notes the influence of the Platonic philosophy.  Huxley relates much of this to art, ranging from medieval cathedrals to Rembrandts to Chinese paintings.  The book ends relating this to madness and schizophrenia as well as mystical experience and modern spiritualism.  The book follows by several appendices focusing on such things as visionary experience induced through carbon dioxide and the stroboscopic lamp, medieval Christian theology and the importance of mystical experience in the life of the medieval individual,the \\"Mind at Large\\", the importance of art in various forms and the importance of color, painting in particular and the Renaissance use of fireworks, the use of mescaline and LSD-25, schizophrenia and madness, and the novel _Sartor Resartus_ by Carlyle.    This book offers two interesting and beautifully written essays in the study of human consciousness and the human mind.  Indeed, Huxley's work was to have an important influence on later explorers of the human mind particularly with the rise of the counter-culture.  Huxley's experiments in mysticism and with psychoactive substances were to prove highly detailed and interesting for the study of the relationship of the human being to God and the spiritual nature of man.

B00J0HCTDK|5|I was on the edge of my seat with this movie and I can see it's set up for a trilogy but doesn't leave you hanging like &#34;Catching Fire&#34; does.  Looking forward to the next
B002VPE1AW|1|Good Points  1)The special effects are great.  2)Although forgettable the music works with the setting.  3)The art direction was cool.    Bad Points  1)The script sucked.  2)The acting sucked.   3)The politics are as subtle as a fully loaded freight train hitting you at top speed.    The next section will have what some may consider spoilers so sorry if I ruin anything.    4)Cameron was a nice guy and allowed someone who needed extra credit in remedial English, middle school level, create the story.While nice of him it does make the story unenjoyable.At the very least a little background on why unobtainium was so darned valueable would be nice.Sure humanity as waged war and destroyed other cultures for minerals but at least we know the reason why those minerals were valuable.In Avatar there is no reason given for why humanity needs unobtainium.As an aside I realize that my grammar sucks as does my general writing abilities.  5)It was much too long for the story told.The story begins with natives who live in harmony with nature and evil outsiders who are willing to destroy everything for a valuable rock.In order to interact easier with natives,I guess it might also be easier to work the environment,  the evil corparation created avatars that a mix of native and human DNA.One of the outsiders is converted to natives side while working as a double agent for the big bad leader of the soldiers for hire.Others side with the natives, people who you expect die, and the natives led by the converted outsider drives off the bad outsiders.Roll the end credits.I just summed up the \\"plot\\" of Avatar. The movie runs for,I think, 2 and half hours with this basic plot.   6)The way the aliens \\"bond\\" with well everything on Pandora has a sightly creepy sexually dominance feel to it. Although it might be the only remotely creative aspect in the story it still is somewhat disturbing.  End of any Spoilers.    It makes me glad that I wasted my money on the cheap no frills DVD edition instead of the full featured special edition. It does make me wonder if the missing footage holds the good acting and a half-way decent plot twist though.
B00CF34B2I|1|I got the demo, and I thought it was pretty good,there were some great decks and amazing graphics so then one day I bought the full version and all of a sudden it stopped working it erased all my data and kept on shutting down and won't even load so, don't even buy the demo, much less the full version.
B00A9X9TIW|4|I really enjoyed the movie I thought the plot was good.  Bruce Willis and Joesph Gordon- Hewitt did a great job they are both very accomplished actors.  The quality of the movie was not very good. I had it streamed to my tv and any other movies we have gotten this way have been clear, this one was not.

B00LWLZRYK|1|I was a big fan of JTE's early stuff and really enjoyed seeing him live here twice. I feel like his past couple of albums have been weak though. On Single Mothers, the songs don't stand out at all. The stuff I enjoyed about him (a sort of tamed down Hank III 5-6 years ago) seems to have been overtaken by a move towards mainstream soft rock. He sounds less like the son of Steve Earle and more like if Richard Marx and Glen Frey procreated. The music is non-offensive and the musicianship is solid but I'm at a loss as to why Vagrant Records would be releasing this. JTE has been railing against &#34;new country&#34; and Nashville for years but this music just sounds like Jackson Brown B-Sides unfortunately.

B005HJWWW8|4|The unit works fine, but because of my age and failing vision, I found it extremely difficult to read the instructions. They're extremely small and the print is so light in contrast that reading them is nearly impossible. I found the same problem with the skimpy instructions that came with my Windows 8 computer. Since I could not read the instructions on the headphone amplifier, I had to experiment with plugs and ports until I got it to sort of work. Next came the operation of the various controls until the unit was working the way the instructions probably described. I expect, though, that there are some additional features that I'm unable to read that would enhance its operation. It's a good unit, does the job well, I only wish these manufacturers and suppliers would enlarge their instruction's print and offer a better contrast.

6304613199|1|Having loved the first Jurassic Park film, I came to this one expecting more of the same kind of thrills.  Unfortunately, what I got was an extremely mean-spirited and poorly-written excuse for a film.  It felt as  though Spileberg had directed the film from home via satellite  communication (save the one day he made a cameo appearance in the TV  reflection at the end).<br />My biggest complaint with the film is, as I've  stated above, the large amount of sadistic, mean-spirited violence  throughout the film.  The first Jurassic Park was fairly light on  dinosaur-involved fatalities, and each time one occurred, it was treated  horrifically, intending the audience to be shocked at the grisly deaths.  In The Lost World, the deaths are treated as eye candy, at which the  viewers are meant to be in awe of.  Sometimes, deaths are protracted to  uncomfortable length (such as the man who is attacked again and again by  the tiny scavenger dinosaurs).  I decided that I didn't like the movie,  however, after my favorite character was killed by the two T-Rexes in a  particularly graphic manner.  (They make a wishbone of his body.)<br />What  burns me even more are the actions of the Vince Vaughn character.  The  animal rights wacko he plays is responsible for the deaths of many humans,  however the audience is supposed to feel that he is justified, because  after all, only the &quot;nasty corporate guys&quot; get killed (with the  exception of the death of the aforementioned favorite character, also a  result of the eco-terrorist).  Apparently, we are suppposed to believe that  the dinosaurs should be preserved at all costs (including human lives),  despite the fact that they had been selected by nature to become  extinct.<br />And then, of course, there is the horrible  T-Rex-on-the-loose-ending sequence, in which more people are killed  unnecessarily.  (Fortunately, the screenwriter, David Koepp, who also made  the abysmal adaptation of the wonderful novel A Stir of Echoes, plays one  of the victims.)  I keep wondering, though, how a T-Rex could kill everyone  on the boat without causing any damage to the cabin or the rest of the  ship, for that matter.  Yet another protracted and sadistic death takes  place (once again, it's okay, because he's a corporate jerk) before the  film is over.<br />Spielberg should be ashamed of this film.  I rather hope he  one day issues a written apology for it.plays one  of the victims.)

B001VNB54A|1|Please be sure to \\"test run\\" the Blu-Ray discs in your player ASAP when you receive them!  I received the same \\"The Pacific\\" Blu-Ray set for Christmas.  However, I did not try the discs out in my player right away.  I had expected everything to run OK (my bad).  When I was ready to watch The PACIFIC (on Feb 15), the discs WOULD NOT LOAD on my Blu-Ray player.  I then upgraded the firmware in my player... The discs still would NOT load.  So... I went out and bought a NEW Blu-Ray player which contained the latest and greatest firmware.  The discs now load ok - but after about 7-8 minutes of play - the discs stop as if the player is in perpetual \\"pause\\" mode.  I must then power my Blu-Ray player OFF and then ON again.  This happens over and over with every one of the discs.  Other Blu-Ray discs play just fine, and yes I have tested these defective discs in other Blu-Ray players with the same result - the screen freezes up after a few minutes of play.<br /><br />I attempted to return these for refund or exchange, however I discovered that I have exceeded the allowable time for returning.  So, I will toss my \\"The PACIFIC\\" discs away and live and learn....  That's why I'm posting this review.  Please TEST your discs as soon as you receive them.
B009G78EE2|5|great music, great lyrics.  Never heard of this album before, but I will look further into it when I get the time.
B003NRYMZQ|4|Innovative stories and plot lines. Very interesting overall. I am most disturbed by the gratuitous homosexual scenes, most of which are not needed to tell the story.
B00BAXFAOW|5|This page turner is jam packed with facts and stories that will blow your mind. You will look at adversity, hopefully, with new eyes, and better yet, view the underdog, who could very well be yourself, as empowered by that very defect. Can't say enough about this book. Every teacher in America, every doctor, everyone, should read it.
B003XRDYX2|5|No I'm not Priscilla, I'm her husband Michael...to put it mildly, Priscilla's not a Dylan disciple...(I'm working on her;)  I have all of these discs in remastered stereo so I wrestled with the need to replicate them in mono, but I decided to bite the bullet.  I was not let down...in fact I was blown away.  These were meant to be heard in Mono.  I have the Beatles sets in Stereo and Mono, while I find the Mono interesting in the Beatles case, I think it's essential in Dylan's.  Hard to explain, but I guess when its just a man and his guitar Stereo just confuses the issue.
B00ECU34ZM|3|Just ok. A bit too long. Ponderous. It lost me a time or two. Possibly a second viewing will have me catching things I may have missed the first time.

B004HO6HWK|1|This was not a bad flick. A perfect popcorn movie for a raining Saturday afternoon. My wife picked up the DVD this morning and I'll return it tomorrow afternoon.The special feature consists of extended/deleted scenes. That's it. No director commentary, no 'making of' segment, no actor/editor/crew/cast commentary - just a crummy extended/deleted scenes bit. I want my money back and that will happen.  I called Best Buy and asked if the Blu-Ray had special features. The only thing different was a tiny feature-ette on guns and BD connect. Yawn. Big deal. Shame on whoever produced this piece of junk DVD.

B000EMGAOY|5|The Peppers came along on the punk/funk scene in the 80's when I was in high school.  They challenged mainstream classifications as an innovator of a sound that boldly and stylishly fused punk, rock, funk, and R&B into their own unique Red Hot sound.  They got our attention.  Their album lyrics and live shows were filled with intense energy and a sexual/macho undercurrent that appealed to both men and women alike.  It was badboy fun and we rocked to it in our cars, at the parties, and at the small and large venues in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and throughout the U.S.A.! <br /> <br />The Peppers have maintained their rowdy boyishness through their career, and this is what has kept their music relevant and exciting for their fans.   <br /> <br />Enter this latest album.  As an early fan from the 80's and 90's I have had the opportunity to sample their albums as they hit the market.  I can honestly say that this new album is one of their best since Blood Sugar Sex Magic.  This truly is a great album.  This album definitely represents a more mature Pepper, but still harnesses the energy and mischieviousness that is Pepper.   <br /> <br />I hope you enjoy and appreciate this album as much as I do.  Have fun, go see the live show, and let loose! I can't wait to see them on this tour; see you there! <br /> <br />Mark

0060594888|5|I have a lot of success books in my personal library, including the classics, Think and Grow Rich, Law of Success, The Magic of Thinking Big among others.  I love reading self-improvement books and borrowed this book from the library not expecting it to be much different than the others but motivational none-the-less.  Boy, was I wrong.  For me this book, puts the \\"icing on the success cake\\" and in some way completes the other success books I have.  The ideas are very practical and I have acutally put them into use more easily than other principles I have read about before (in the other books I own).<br /><br />As I pursue my personal goals, it is the principles presented in Canfield's book that I recall and put into practice.  It keeps me motivated to continue to pursue the goals I have set for myself.  I haven't finished my first reading and yet I am experiencing a positive and enpowering difference in my life.<br /><br />I feel asthough this is It!  This is the book I needed to owe,read and apply to take me to the next level in every area of my life.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour order the book, read it, study it and apply what you read and you can't go wrong.  Totally Excellent!!!!!

B0058YPL66|5|My husband and I got this series on DVD for ourselves. We watched the first two discs and realized that it was 'safe' for our teen and tween aged kids, so we re-started watching the series with them and they were both, son and daughter, completely as wrapped up in the story as we were. How wonderful to find such an engrossing TV series that is adult-level entertainment, but good for older kids as well.

B008220DGE|3|I own Paul Thomas Anderson's \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"There Will Be Blood\\" on DVD, and I consider the former one of my very favorite films and the latter to be a confusing yet moving character study that leaves me (perhaps deliberately) a little cold.  I watched \\"The Master\\" for the first time on DVD last week, and I decided to give myself a full seven days before trying to respond to it in a review.  Similar in many ways - and yet ultimately less satisfying - to \\"There Will Be Blood,\\" Paul Thomas Anderson's newest character study is a complex, emotional portrait of a man lost in the aftermath of war, who makes a series of very poor choices, and in the process, gets sucked into and eventually spat out of a cult not unlike Scientology.<br /><br />There is no real reason for me to like \\"The Master,\\" and if it were not for the track record of Paul Thomas Anderson, I doubt I would have ever watched it.  It's bleak, confusing, and a bit troubling, yet I have to admit that I like it, to a degree, though it falls short of being compared to \\"Boogie Nights\\" or \\"There Will Be Blood.\\"  Here's what works - it is beautifully photographed and really captures America in the post-war years with a great deal of detail and mood.  It boasts a wonderful cast, including an actor that I had all but given up on, Joaquin Phoenix.  As much as I love Philip Seymour Hoffman, I do not ever, at any point, understand his character.  And while the brilliant Amy Adams has very little to do during the film's rather bloated 140+ minutes, I enjoyed this change of pace.  Anyone who has seen Amy in her perkier roles will likely be impressed by her morose, domineering presence in this film.  The scene where she rather violently bombards Joaquin Phoenix with a series of sexually explicit language is both memorable and disturbing.<br /><br />In the end, after investing more than two hours of my life into this film, it just did not click.  What begins as a character study of a lost post-war American solider becomes stranger and murkier as it moves along to the point that the ending, if one can call it that, is a complete letdown.  If you're a Paul Thomas Anderson fan already, there is likely something here to appreciate.  I enjoyed aspects of the film, but felt it was too disjointed to love as an entire unit.  Worth a rental, perhaps.

B008FPOIT6|5|Well told story about what really matters.  And very nerdy which is also a plus. Quick pace and great characters.
B007ZSE1M8|5|Could be a little longer - not much in terms of '80s and '90s activity.
B0030E1XJU|4|This has been exactly how we imagined when we bought it.  Very durable, and a fun concept too.  It is neat that it can be added to other sets, and you can make a whole series of chain reactions, so it teaches planning in play, which is nice.  If  you just wanted to set up a playground scenario for your toys, than it can be played this way too.  Highly recommend.
B008Y2FRFO|4|like it.  game is pretty fun glad I downloaded it.  will play again.  thank you.  I love my kindle fire
B00S67WK3O|5|Packaging is top notch, better than expected. Wheel is actually surrounded with rubber.
B000T433CO|5|One of my favorite non-traditional holiday movies!
B001EBROWQ|5|This used to be on every Easter in the old days, but now I never see it on anywhere, so i rented it from Amazon Instant video. This is a classic movie and it is a nice retelling of the basic biblical version of Jesus's life. It's a good way to get to know him if you don't know anything about him. Max von Sydow is a little over the top dramatically as Jesus, but not too bad. I like Telly Savalas as the Roman governor.

B00G3L6KQI|5|I can't believe I'm finished.  I received my copy of &#34;The Book of Life&#34; at Book Expo America in New York at the end of May, and I was fortunate enough to meet Deborah Harkness when she signed my book.<br /><br />&#34;The Book of Life&#34; is a well crafted conclusion to the All Souls Trilogy.  We finally get to the bottom of the true meaning behind Ashmole 782 and what it contains.<br /><br />I was entranced by this tale and enjoyed a wide range of emotions while reading this final book.  It begins right where &#34;Shadow of Night&#34; left off and takes us through the adventure of the search for Ashmole 782, brings a new enemy to the forefront and new challenges for our main characters Diana and Matthew.  I loved the fact that a great many ideas and story-lines from the original books were brought back in this book  to be given proper attention and resolution.  I loved when a character I was sure I left behind resurfaced with an even bigger story to tell.<br /><br />Most of all, I love Diana and Matthew and the family of creatures that surround them.  Walking away from this story is sad, but satisfying with just enough mystery left to have you wondering what these characters are up to for years.<br /><br />A solid 5 stars for the creative storytelling, the mysterious search that is finally concluded, the characters that you want to spend time with, and for the amazing mix of fantasy, science, academics, and romance that keep you enthralled.  I'm sad to see this series end, but I'm so glad I went along for the ride.

B007712XAU|4|I have disc 2 of season 2 break.  After i watched it...thank goodness.  However I am not the only one I know with a broken disc 2.  Anyone else had this happen??  I think it is a manufacture defect andd they should replace it.  I do not think it is just a coincidence.
0439023483|5|I read this book November 2008 but I had to do a review on it here because it was AWESOME. My definition of awesome may be different than other people's, but this book was just ... great.<br /><br />It is based on a post-apocalyptic North America that has already endured wars over remaining resources and then a government arose called \\"The Capitol\\" and organized 13 districts across the continent. Needless to say the districts did not like the capitol so they formed a rebellion. Well, the capitol won by a landslide because they have all the money and technology and they completely annihilated district 13 - leaving nothing alive. Anyway, to make sure that the districts never form any such rebellion again The Capitol holds the annual Hunger Games to remind everyone that they are in charge.<br /><br />The Hunger games begin by having a lottery and they pick 1 girl and 1 boy from each district between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in these hunger games (so a total of 24 contestants). So you wonder, \\"How does holding a competition make people stay in line?\\" The answer is simple, it's a fight to the death.<br /><br />They hold the competition in a huge arena that varies in landscape from year to year. The desert, mountains, etc. It's a huge arena that use tiny cameras to catch all the excitement and the game makers can control all the variables. If things aren't interesting enough for those watching they can start a massive forest fire, or unleash some rabid beast. The last remaining contestant is the victor and they are granted fame and glory.<br /><br />The book starts on the day of the 79th annual Hunger Games lottery.<br /><br />The rest of the book is completely unpredictable which is why I liked it so much. When I put it down Sunday night to go to bed my brain kept trying to figure out ways that the book could possibly end up and out of all the ways it came up with ... it never did figure out the actual story line.<br /><br />Anyway, the only bad part about the book was when I found out it's the first book in a trilogy so there will be 2 more books to come. The next one - Catching Fire - came out in Sept 2009 and the last book comes out August 24, 2010.<br /><br />The first book does stand alone ... there is a definite \\"ending\\", but then you read the last page and you wish you would have stopped reading just 1 page earlier because now you have to wait another year to figure out how the story \\"really ends\\" and then another year after that to find out how THAT story ends.<br /><br />I really hate waiting.trilogy so there will be 2 more books to come.

0688156819|5|I really enjoy this book illustrated and written by Tim Burton.  Kids may find it too scary since I know some adults who think its creepy.  My only negative thing to say is that I wish it had more stories.  The entire book can be read in 15 minutes, which is more like a teaser than a real book. But the stories that are in there are quality and clever.
1476727651|3|How do you write a sequel to the quintessential haunted house story after the haunted house is gone? Stephen King takes on the challenge with “Doctor Sleep,” his long-awaited follow-up to his horror classic, “The Shining.”<br /><br />Flawed protagonists are usually the most interesting, and here the book is strong as we pick up with Danny Torrance as a troubled alcoholic adult drifting around the country doing odd jobs and trying to cope with his horrific past. We suffer along with Danny and his tribulations, and share in his triumphs as well. Danny hits rock bottom and ends up listening to Tony again, who tells him to get off a bus in a small New Hampshire town. He finds a job there and an AA sponsor who helps him get his life on track. He works at the local hospice, and quickly gains a reputation for being able to help its residents “cross to the other side” when their time comes. He ends up encountering Abra, a young girl with Shining powers far exceeding his own. Abra becomes a target for the “True Knot,” a group of traveling baddies in RVs who stay young by feeding on the “steam” of people who shine, especially children, for whom the power seems to be strongest. Dan and Abra team up with his friends to fight the True Knot and try to end their evil butchery.<br /><br />Don’t read “Doctor Sleep” expecting “The Shining 2.” It is a different book that continues the character of Danny and the power of Shining in a different context. The book and its approach is interesting in its own way and keeps you turning the pages. After a good beginning where Danny is facing his demons, however, I thought that the novel lost a bit of its nasty edge. Once we trade Danny’s problems with sobriety for the antagonists in the True Knot, the book never really seems that threatening to me.<br /><br />“Doctor Sleep” is grittier than many of King’s more recent works, which is a good thing, but I have many questions about the story that were never really answered. *SPOILER ALERT* For example, what is the origin of the True Knot? I don't understand why the True Knot is having trouble finding enough steam. There is a higher population and thus more deaths - violent and otherwise - than ever before, so why is there less steam now? How do they collect steam in canisters? If the True Knot “suffered from extreme altitude sickness,&#34; why do they not have any trouble camping in the Rockies at the site if the old Overlook Hotel, probably well over a mile in altitude? If Abra can read the True Knot's minds, at least partially, she knows they are dying and thus time is on her side. Wouldn't she also know about their aversion to flying, so she, her father and Danny could just fly overseas until the True Knot just died out? The True Knot has consumed the steam of probably thousands if not tens of thousands through the centuries, so why do they get the measles now, and why is it killing them? I can't believe they've never been exposed before. And what about other more deadly diseases they surely have come in contact with before, such as AIDS, the plague, and others? *END SPOILER ALERT*<br /><br />One thing I noticed in the book is how similar Teeny Town is to the amusement park in King's novella Joyland. Both books mention Wilmington NC too. I wonder if Joyland was a writing exercise King used while prepping for this book.<br /><br />Other reviewers calling “Doctor Sleep” a supernatural adventure instead of a horror story are probably close to the truth. It is an enjoyable read, and it is good to catch up with Danny, but I had too many questions about the True Knot really to be intimidated by them. The characters are good, especially Danny, Abra, Billy and Dr. Dalton. I think “Doctor Sleep” is a good effort by King, and he should be commended for taking on the challenge of writing a sequel to a classic because he certainly doesn't have to. He writes a book that stands on its own merits without rehashing “The Shining’s” haunted house theme, but “Doctor Sleep” doesn't quite seem to develop the new premise fully. I am left with the feeling that there should be more.hining’s” haunted house theme, but “Doctor Sleep” doesn't quite seem to develop the new premise fully. I am left with the feeling that there should be more.

1592400876|5|I borrowed Eats, Shoots & Leaves from my local library because I'd heard about it but didn't think I'd enjoy it. Was I surprised! The book is full of examples of how poor punctuation mangles meaning, with clear guidance on how punctuation should be used. But perhaps I enjoyed it more than some of the other reviewers here because, like Ms. Truss, I'm a stickler and can't bear to see poorly punctuated signs and headlines. I enjoyed Ms. Truss's sense of humor and, frankly, some of her jokes had me laughing out loud. <br /> <br />I don't however, recommend the book as a guide for American readers who need help with punctuation. The differences between punctuation in British and American English are considerable at times -- for example, the placement of periods at the end of quotes and the use of periods in abbreviations -- and someone who is not aware of the rules may be confused by the examples, which usually show the British style. Instead, the book is better for readers who already have a good grasp of punctuation. The book includes fascinating history, colorful examples, and hilarious commentary. Who'd expect that in a book about punctuation? <br /> <br />As for my library copy, I'm bringing it back today. I've already ordered a printed copy from Amazon.com to send to one of my editors (who I've nicknamed \\"the comma king\\") and an audio copy to listen to on my next long drive. Somehow, I get the feeling that hearing a British voice read the book's text will make it even more enjoyable.

B002NUULNG|5|I prefer this version to the original. The animation is better, as in the do some very cool things. Not overkill either where it's flooded with effects to show off the technology at the time. The original is awesome and great animation for its time, I just prefer this prettier version. The original has it's charm, but I just prefer this one.
B00A3NQNUU|5|I have been playing Dragon vale for almost 2 years,I'm really getting frustrated!!  First I had a level 49 game that crashed, retrievable. Ok so I started from scratch, now!!!!!!! I keep getting told there are updates and when I clicked on the link it takes me back to the game and the cycle starts all over<br /><br />I love my game but I'm really getting fed up
B008JFUR10|3|It's a good movie. Honestly I expected the CG in a movie with a higher budget to have more realistic creatures and robots (Transformers were better) but overall I would give it 3 stars. The lead players are primarily what kept me from giving it 4 stars. The idea for the movie was good but a better performance by the acting crew would certainly have given it a boost. I'm not sure who would have been the best performers in this type of movie but at in my mind, big budget films deserve big name stars. The only one I can think of that has recently proven that wrong is the new Star Trek movies.
B004QOB8SO|5|You go Sherlock and John.<br />The product was great and the season was fantastic.<br /><br />and six more words are required... (this probably won't be a helpful rating)

B00FAPF5U0|5|I didn't order it, but I quiet sure the 5 year old enjoyed it.
B00JB3MVCW|1|An extraordinary amount of artistic license was taken with this movie, and the end result is nothing close to the biblical story or characters. Do you remember Noah as an attempted baby killer? Neither do I.<br /><br />The &#34;creators&#34; (inside joke you'll understand after watching) of the movie caved so much to pressure by athiest and religion bashing groups that they have ended up with a movie that is almost unbearable to watch.<br /><br />I can see now why Muslim, Christian, and Jewish groups have repudiated this movie.<br /><br />I wish it was returnable.
B00AO2P3GA|5|This is what I get my gaming fix from love it
B00FB13Y74|5|Well I have a lot of apps for angry birds. But this one is different. I personally think that angry birds go is unique. Instead of trying to get rid of the pigs they race them. And personally THAT is different from what you would be expected. But the angry birds go is showing that the pigs and the birds can get along in a rivaling way. Which in a way is good. More then unique. But um if someone who works for angry birds go is reading this I suggest that put more power ln to Terrance. Lightning is BORING l have seen it and tried it. Also if we could get more coins without spending money er diamonds would be nice.

By the time I got up to the counter, I knew I had to have it. Fantastic voice, excellent songs, this is one of the best blues CDs I have heard, and plan to take a listen to more of her music.  If you like blues, check this one out.
B00B8PMWJI|4|Some of them are very hit or miss. From the first time I ever saw the trailer, I was expecting something weird. However I underestimated just how weird it would be. Z was very WTF, which put W's to shame, but W is my favourite of them all.

B00004W50T|4|While Music From Big Pink is an exceptional album, the one thing it lacks happens to be the one thing I like most about the Band- their roots rock style.    Most of the songs on here are mellow to the point of borderline balladry.  \\"Tears of Rage\\" and \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" are perfect examples of exceptionally mellow tunes.  While extremely melodic and effective in coming close to bringing me to tears in a few spots thanks to some amazing range in the lead singers voice, it's a *tad* disappointing that the album includes a couple other songs in similar style (the smash hit \\"The Weight\\" being another obvious example).  These are the kind of songs that we only need one or two per album- not four or five.      Also, maybe it's just me, but \\"Tears of Rage\\" sounds like a *major* influence for George Harrison's \\"Beware of Darkness\\".  Both songs feel like they're written almost exactly the same way.    However the album does have its share of excellent rockers as well.  \\"To Kingdom Come\\" excels in a super melodic display of guitar soloing, and this version of \\"Chest Fever\\" defeats all other versions (especially the instrumental version from Sugarloaf's debut) because of its incredibly catchy vocal melody and that organ (or keyboard?) solo in the middle.  Terrific stuff.    I don't know what to think about a song like \\"In a Station\\".  It's melodic, yes, but it fails to really grab me and feels somewhat dated (and honestly reminds me of circus music a little bit).  I understand the Band is an underrated experimental band that occasionally explores such adventurous territory, so I'll give it a free pass.    I can definitely see why everyone makes a fuss about Music From Big Pink, but the Band's next three albums are honestly a bit better.  Yes, even Cahoots is growing on me more with each passing day and has the potential to surpass this album in the listenability department.      Still, Music From Big Pink is a highly melodic, emotionally charged effort that's just as rewarding as most of the reviews make it seem.  Just don't expect an instant classic or the very best album the Band has to offer.

B000083E79|5|Never the biggest Cher fan, I was stunned by the droves of people across the country clamoring to her Farewell Tour concert.  I never had much interest, although I'm sure she put on a good show.<br />Then I saw this CD.  Sure are a lot of hits on it, so I put it in the CD player and was whisked away.<br />Aha!  That is why Cher's fans said farewell numerous times!  It's all explained in a FANTASTIC best hits album with twenty-one (!!) songs on it.<br />From &quot;Dark Lady&quot; to her remake of the &quot;Shoop Shoop Song&quot; from Mermaids, there is not one song that didn't have me singing.<br />There it is.  I'm a Cher fan now.<br />So I must whole-heartedly recommend this album to fans and not-yet-fans alike, because it is packed with her best stuff.<br />See you at the next Farewell concert...

B00I32F35Y|5|Delain does it again. Saw them live in NYC and I cant wait to see them again. Clearly they have become my fav band after over a year of absence when there wasnt one. Its getting more difficult year after year, album after album trying to choose an overall fav song. If you havent heard them before then you need to get a jump on them. Its great to know that good metal is still out there. Something not like anything else.

B000068TPN|5|This film has to be by far the greatest war story I have ever come across so far.  It not only shows that war is pure Hell but it is also the first Vietnam film ever made that shows the true honor and patriotism that our soldiers fought with.  \\"We Were Soldiers\\" also gives to the veterans who fought in Vietnam the honor and recognition they should have received all along.  <br />To any veterans who read this review I just want to say thank you from the bottom of my heart for the sacrifices you have made for our country.  You did nothing to deserve the contempt and hate you recieved from the people of this country and you risked your lives anyway.  I hold each of you in the highest respect for standing your ground and fighting for our freedom and the rights we enjoy today.  And thank you to the makers of this film for giving us the opportunity to finally see the true nature of the American soldier.
B00DIJQAI6|1|Could not get this to install.
B00T38G0Z4|4|I'm enjoying this. Here's the thing, I'm guessing the only people who are buying this are VH fans. And if you're a fan, then you already know what DLR sounds like, and has sounded like for quite a few years now. Ever hear of YouTube? So I'm a little skeptical about all the ragging on his voice. You should've known what you'd be getting. DLR is not a good singer anymore that is true, and yes, can be cringe worthy. That said, this is a FUN album. I could complain about the mix, the guitar tone, DLR's voice, MA's absence, but hey, the band for the most part sounds fantastic and hearing EVH live doesn't get any better. Get over DLR's voice and just rock out! The guy has a ton of energy and his enthusiasm is infectious. Like others have said, this is a true live recording with all the flaws and blemishes, but it's raw and packs a punch like a real rock concert should. Just listen with an open mind and crank it up - it's only rock n' roll and I like it!
B00EY8BRGU|3|It was good
B00080ZG10|4|The film played perfectly on my laptop, no sign of errors. The CD looked extremely pristine and I honestly have nothing to say bad about.
B00EOARZ4G|2|At the end of the book, the author confessed that he wrote this book to resemble the writing in as M*A*S*H* episode.  The entire thing reads very different from the master -storyteller manner you are probably used to. It is such a drastic difference and devoid of geopolitical insight & action.  It gets wordy to the point that you'll skip ahead a lot to avoid the boring sections.

I love that!

1616550414|5|I had actually never heard of this book. I came on amazon one day, and it suggested it to me, and since it was for a decent price I ordered it. This book is actually amazing. It clarifies everything you already know, and gives you more facts to back up the arguments, as well as you learn a lot of new things that weren't too blatant, and it poses some questions that leaves it up to your imagination to fill in (like is the ocarina of time made from the same material as the timeshift stones from skyward sword?)
B001EKSW82|5|Sometimes it's great things you come across when you can't sleep due to jet lag :-) Started to surf amazon's mp3 downloads and stumbled over this new album wihin hours of its release...pure accident, but a great one:    Fantastic riffs, hard yet melodic, dirrrty guitars, epic feel...all you love in Viking Metal!

I ordered some stuff direct from china after I placed this order, and I already got them, wow pretty lame.

B002PZ6XB8|5|Truly enjoyed this. Charming!
B0071XO8RA|5|Just finished this marvellous series and I can only say I am completely blown away by just how well Hugh Howey writes. Great concept, detailed characters, twists and turns in the plot that really surprise but never seem outlandish...all adds up to a book that I just couldn't stop reading. Loved it. Highly recommended
B004S9AK3G|5|Without doubt, one of the best authors today. A big read, captivating and Follet's choice of words paint a great picture of what live was like back then.
B007L7JY3Y|3|Dont use it much, too much work to just log a simple todo and I use a calendar on my android for everything else.
B005ZOBNOI|5|I read the book so I could watch the movie. It was so good I am now afraid that the movie will be disappointing.
B000009O8A|3|I confess I have a warm, soft spot in my heart for violent female revenge movies.  At the top of the list are LA FEMME NIKITA and THE LAST SEDUCTION.  MS. 45 is a very stylish core collection here.  And so we come to I SPIT  ON YOUR GRAVE.  In a way the most realistic of the bunch (the hillbilly  rapists are incredibly believable, much more than the hillbillies in  DELIVERANCE though not as menacing).  But also the simplest plot.  And yet,  not quite so simple.  We know what our heroine is going to do.  But she  diesn't do it by brute force, she does it by trickery and guile, making the  revenge ever-so-sweeter.  Be prepared for a cheaply produced  movie--stitches appear on our heroine's face even though she didn't see a  doctor, but a couple of days later they are all gone as if they never were  there at all, even though she didn't take time out to go to New York to see  a top plastic surgeon.  All right, so the makeup department was  underbudgeted. And the pace of the movie is a bit slow, perhaps because it  was done way back in 1978, when it was probably fast for those days. Three  stars coming from this cheapskate reviewer is high praise, and I believe  you'll thoroughly enjoy this movie if you don't go in expecting  DELIVERANCE.  It definitely belongs on the Female Revenge Movie shelf,  which is saying a lot because it's a short shelf of real goodies.
B006H3MIV8|4|I'm a fan of broken, unmusical voices.  Leonard Cohen, Vic Chesnutt, Tom Waits...and Bob Dylan.  But as is so often the case, the compositions of these amazing singer/songwriters can sound fresh and vibrant in the vocals of someone more, shall we say, technically accomplished.  Such is the case with many of the songs on \\"Chimes.\\"  Although, having said that, an early favorite is Kris Kristofferson's take on \\"The Mighty Quinn,\\" which makes superb use of gargles-with-glass throatiness.  The songs on this album span nearly the entire length of Dylan's career so far, even reviving a couple of favorites from his gospel-influenced days.  I'm not a fan of what Sinead O'Connor did with the song \\"Property of Jesus,\\" but I did appreciate someone resurrecting the song.  Same with \\"Gotta Serve Somebody.\\"  Perhaps the best songs are the ones that play directly into Amnesty International's messages of peace and justice.  Dylan seems like the perfect poster child for AI, and the international flavor of many of the tracks underscores that message.  The other way that the medium emphasizes the message is in the album's dizzying tolerance--not to say embrace--of all styles, from front-porch folk (Pete Seeger on \\"Forever Young\\") to harmonious punk (Bad Religion on \\"It's All Over Now, Baby\\"), to every point in between.  Forget ebony and ivory--if Miley Cyrus can live side-by-side with K'NAAN in my MP3 player, perhaps there's hope we can all learn to get along.
B00AE2I4B6|3|I enjoyed the movie, the storyline was interesting (but no real surprises) and the dancing was great to watch, but at times it looked totally computer generated, which was disappointing.  I think most people are going to watch this movie to see the great dancing, but to often than not it looked fake, so I give this movie only a 3.
B00KFUU6H2|5|Great series!!
B00BAXFECK|4|Not the most brilliant writing, but an incredibly captivating story that had my attention the entire time. Can't wait for the movie, I'm sure that's not far off.
B0025UHKNS|4|The best I ever used. The GPS and all other features are very good and the clock is comfortable. The menu and bezel features are well designed. The only problem so far was that the information in the manuals is too simple. I needed around 3 to 4 hours to get the clock and the ANT agent to communicate with each other, so the run could be downloaded to my laptop and see the extraordinary report in myGarmin web. I followed the instructions, but in every step I found new complications. Finally I was exploring the ANT menu and realized to put everything in Yes. It seems obvious and stupid, but it is not. Reading the manual it seems like an automatic feature, but several were disabled and the manual didn't cover all the possibilities shown in the menu.  I would suggest Garmin people to try to make a comprehensive manual covering every corner of the menu. If you are not familiar with computers and software, you will need help because there are additional upgrades that I had to install additionally to the software indicated by Garmin.  You have several displays available during training but I couldn't find one with the heart rate in big numbers. For presbiopic people it would be a plus. Not everyone has a perfect vision.
B0055V6EZE|2|Should have skipped this one.
B00A0SO4S6|4|We really enjoyed this classic movie.
0425241505|5|The hardest reviews for me to write are often the books that I am absolutely crazy about.  Dragon Bound would be one of said books.  You would think it would be easier since I am so psyched, but I think the excitement just takes over and instead of words coming out of my mouth it is more like giddy squeals.  Sad I know, but true.  I am going to try and tone it down so I articulate the awesomeness of this book to you now.    Dragon Bound is the first book in what looks to be an extremely addictive adult paranormal romance series.  Thea Harrison introduces you to a world where paranormal creatures are not just prevalent they are also widely known about by humans and live among them.  Almost any paranormal creature you can think of is present in this book.  There are vampires, and fae and dragons, oh my!  For the purposes of this book though, we mostly focus in on the wyr, which are a form of shape shifters.  In essence each wyr has an animal, that can be either real or mythological, they can shift into or take human form to blend more easily into society.    Our leading male, Dragos, is a wyr whose base form is a dragon and his human form is hot!  I mean, an extremely wealthy businessman known for his ruthless and unforgiving personality.  He is also the most dominant alpha male I have read about in a long time.  Words like \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" do not exist in his vocabulary.  He does not ask you a question, he tells you your opinion and then just gives you an order.    Enter, Pia, our leading lady.  We know that she is a half wyr, half human, but her animal form is unknown.  You will eventually figure it out, but I will not be revealing that information here.  It is much more fun to try and riddle it out as you progress through the book and hints are dropped.  Pia has grown up living almost a half life since her mother past away.  She internalizes her problems and is very private.  She longs to find love and fill that hole her mothers death has left.  In an attempt to trust again, she let a couple of secrets about her identity slip to her now ex-boyfriend who uses the information to blackmail her. She is trying to learn from her mistakes and as a result she has put up a wall around her heart.  Pia definitely is not a girl who likes to take orders and watching her stand up to Dragos stubbornness is extremely entertaining.    The two get thrown together when Pia steals something from Dragos, who in turn hunts her down to take revenge.  Of course when he finds her, she intrigues him so much he deciedes to keep her around for a while instead of torturing her.  He does not have long to try and break down her walls though, because they are soon in a serious car crash, captured by goblins, beaten and left for dead to rot in prison.  And that is only the first part of their little adventure!    Dragos and Pia chemistry sparks immediately and it continues to burn throughout the length of the book.  While trying to escape immanent death, Pia attempts to teach Dragos some manners and introduce him to polite conversation, which is beyond amusing.  While he does not get the hang of it right away, the behavior does start to take hold and watching the progression of Dragos character throughout the book was fascinating.    Overall this book is just amazing.  I am going to go ahead and say it is the best book I have read this year.  I know that is a bold statement, but that is exactly how I feel about it.  I started the book when I got home from work one night and stayed up until one a.m. to finish.  I could not put the book down for a second!  I actually made myself slow down towards the end of reading it so I could draw out the experience.  The best part?   This is just book one, we still have more to come in the future!  The next book comes out in August and is titled Storm's Heart.  I am really excited about it because if focuses on Tricks.  She had me cracking up in Dragon Bound, so a whole book about her is going to be a real treat.If you have not discovered this series, you need to.  It is a captivating story that will grab a hold of you and demand your full, undivided attention.

B000MR9D5E|4|A stunningly remarkable journey, replete with<br />lingering astonishments and pulchritudinous<br />environments, splendidly captured in their natural<br />effulgent glory. Narrated with punctilious timing,<br />a notable perspicacity though mildly magniloquent,<br />and soothing inflections despite occasional moments<br />of malevolent territorial disputes and tense encounters<br />for natural resources. Planet's \\"Diaries\\"' is wholly<br />meritorious in its laborious achievements and impressive<br />contrivances,  providing us with exceptional experiences<br />of our confounding, nurturing, and ever-changing Mother.<br /><br />It's simply awesome.<br /><br />A one star deduction for hints of Darwinism and<br />Global Warming.

B000XUBFE2|5|I am speechless! No words can say what hasn't already been said in this writing! Amazing is one of the words to describe it! As a quote once said, I have lived a thousand lives. This book lives up to this quote in only one book!
B00DV2D0JC|4|Great game, kept me interested for ages.
B002BCNK1Q|5|Clint Eastwood at his best, just when you think he couldn't be any better. He plays this role well. An old school man refusing to leave his culturally diverse neighborhood and in the end, you can't help but understand both sides of this racially packed drama.
B00L9B7IKE|3|I thought the writing was good and the POV changes interesting, but the story was slow, and I figured out who the murderer was early.  Most of the story was about a woman losing her battle with alcoholism.
0399536108|5|This is a good book for those who are looking to take the unconventional path in any facet of life.  Although the author is taking the unconventional method to travel the world, his ideas can be transferred to any lifestyle.  His goal for himself and the reader is to lead a remarkable life, which is unique to every person.  Great book for those who want to take the less-traveled path to personal success.
B001MV49HG|5|I can't even put into words how incredible Oasis was and still is. You either get it or you don't. They were a remarkable balance of badass and sentiment. They were endearing musicians and people. They captured the spirit of youth in a way very few ever did or have since. The songs stand up over many years of listening. The melodies are brilliant and the lyrics simple and catchy while remaining creative.<br /><br />Simply put, they were the best.
B0063M22QO|5|Fun and fast when I'm bored.  Love to play Mahjong on the computer, but this is more fun.  Smaller, challenging games.

B00EGMQIJ0|5|I say the above about the book and also the encroaching dystopia it envisions.  Eggers' heroine is a normal young girl who is coaxed into becoming the figurehead for an emerging conscienceless totalitarian dictatorship.  In the process she even supervises the demise of someone she once loved.  But how subtly the tyranny approaches, with even its foremost proponents shockingly innocent in the face of the complete loss of personal privacy they will impose upon the world, a world where the majority will happily succumb to its mastery.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Lots of fun
B009LDD590|5|Most exciting series from HBO since The Wire! One can't help but feel certainty compassion and sympathy for Nucky, even though he is an evil person. Lots of nudity, so not great for viewing with teenagers.
B0007PLLQ0|5|Best fantasy love story I've seen.    Excellent costumes, makeup, actors, and of course love story.  Must see. Descriptions just can't come close!   John
B009IH0ICG|5|This is a good little chimney starter.  It starts coals quickly and is well-constructed.  It is compact so holds a little over half as much as the big chimneys.
B002N44XSG|5|I liked this book,because it has funny parts in it, and because it has some good information about the  characters. I rated this book 5 stars,because of the in depth interviews with Percy ,  Claresse, Grover and  Annabeth that they wouldn't have told you in the books. But  overall, it's just a good book.

0345536886|4|John Grisham is a best-selling machine in contemporary literarure. He is to legal drama what Tom Clancy is to military intrigue and what Ludlum was to the espionage thriller and what J.K. Rowling is to YA fantasy. And, as it turns out, Grisham could write funny things. THE LITIGATORS introduces a cast of characters so disreputable even Deck Shifflet crosses the street when they approach.<br /><br />One of Grisham's recurring themes surfaces, the one with the idealistic lawyer going toe-to-toe with a giant corporation. THE LITIGATORS tracks the misadventures of Finley & Figg, a two-man \\"boutique\\" law firm nestled in one of Chicago's low-rent districts. Oscar Finley is the crusty senior partner (he hates his wife). Wally Figg is the rotund junior partner (and a recovering alcoholic). Both are ham-and-eggers who rely on relentless ambulance chasing for their bread and butter. Neither had ever tried a case in court. They prefer to settle. Not everyone can be Perry Mason or Atticus Finch. Wally Figg, the more ambitious of the two, dreams of seeing his mug planted on bus stop billboards and in television adverts.<br /><br />Business is rough, cases are few and rarely lucrative. The last thing the firm and its shady operators needed was to hire young Harvard Law graduate David Zinc. David had, earlier today, suffered a nervous breakdown, quit his fast-track career at a prestigious law firm, and had gone on a drinking binge. David Zinc desperately requires a change of pace. He mourns the past five years he'd wasted as a nameless cog in a vast machinery. And he, too, had never tried a case in court. Finley and Figg take him in, anyway. At this stage, you could drop a Three Stooges reference and it wouldn't be inappropriate.<br /><br />I mentioned that Wally Figg is the ambitious one? He's always had a jones for the easy buck, for castles in the air. His latest scheme involves jumping in bed with all them other lawyers gearing up in a mass tort case against Varrick Labs, a Big Pharma company responsible for producing a drug called Krayoxx which reduces cholesterol but also may be inducing heart attacks. Wally is salivating, with an eye towards a sure thing, the easiest class action suit ever. He drags a reluctant Oscar and David along. He signs up clients who have either taken Krayoxx or had lost someone who'd taken Krayoxx. He files his motions. And then the \\"boutique\\" law firm of Finley & Figg sits back and waits for this pharmaceutical giant to crumble and pay up. A cocky Wally even signs notes promising his clients millions of settlement money.<br /><br />So, yeah, overnight, the Finley & Figg law firm became specialists in mass tort litigation. But they should've brushed up on their Perry Mason and their Atticus Finch.<br /><br />For whatever reason I hadn't picked up a Grisham novel in years. THE LITIGATORS returns me to the fold, even if it's not as suspenseful or electric or, frankly, as ambitious as, say, THE FIRM or THE RUNAWAY JURY. It's a lightweight read, but I couldn't stop reading. It's a sly, tongue-in-cheek expos&eacute; on the seedier elements of lawyering. I like the lead character. David Zinc makes for a likable protagonist, likable because of his inexperience and his idealism and his resolve (although, okay, in some ways, he's too passive). He somehow reminds me of Mitch McDeere and Rudy Baylor. David's presence serves as a grounding element whereas Finley & Figg tend to come across as caricatures who endlessly bicker and unscrupulously practice law. However, Finley & Figg, with their bottom-feeder escapades, also provide chuckles.g Pharma company responsible for producing a drug called Krayoxx which reduces cholesterol but also may be inducing heart attacks.

B0050DIWFC|4|Hard read because of subject. But read until last sentence. You won't be disappointed you kept with it. Our book club didn't have great discussion.
B000FC2L1E|5|This great saga continues in page turning excitement! Jaime and Claire combine a rich passion and love of life that makes you feel that you are there with them.
B007URVZJ6|5|Worked perfectly and I liked it so much I download its other versions for my PC and Android Cell Phone.
1484721837|5|My 10 year old loves this series and had to have this new book as soon as it was out.  He's read it several times since he's received it.  A great book!
B007HJ84ZK|5|I was expecting the series to be as far from the books as True Blood was from their original source material...I bought it cuz I'm OCD & have to own the movie version of any book I love so what a pleasant surprise I was in for. Was it exact? maybe not, but close enough for hand grenades & horse shoes. For those who don't like the fact that \\"underdogs and good guys don't win\\" or that their fave characters get the axe all I have to say is READ THE BOOKS. And it's refreshing to see a realistic look at the fact that the underdog usually doesn't win, the bad guy usually does prevail generally because he is the bad guy & willing to do ANYTHING to win...while good guys always have rules. Life isn't fair that is reality...well how refreshing that a series of books & a series tips it's hat to that fact. Do I like seeing my fave characters killed off? no but like I said life isn't fair. Trust me if the series sticks to the source material as closely as the 1st season has you'll be throwing your remotes through your tv's in seasons 3 and 4, trust me I threw the the books. So I say sit back & enjoy one of the the best if not the best fantasy series out there. I know I will....I'm seriously thinking of subscribing to HBO just for this series
B000EWBKM6|3|I love Will & Grace, but this finale was very disappointing....not as bad as Seinfeld's, almost as good as Friends' and not even close to Cheers'. Jack and Karen's duet got this the extra star. The end of the finale was TOO much with Will and Grace being old and their kids magically going to the same college with the same rooms and meeting up and probably dating. If I wanted that much closure I would watch the reunion show. It could have ended with them talking again after so many years apart, but the producers felt the need to go WAY into the future to try to enhance the nostalgia.
B000O179EK|5|Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors and this is one of his best<br /><br />My favorite Bridge's movie is True Gritt.<br /><br />Both are great.
B00HTYTQ5A|5|Fabulous take on the old classic. One of the best I've ever seen. I couldn't stop watching them.
B003E8P9G0|5|This is an awesome book and I read it in just a week! It leaves off on a mystery on every chapter so then you want to find out more on what's going to happen next and you end up reading the next chapter and the next until your almost done with the book!!!
B0038M2AZA|1|I was not able to watch the movie /dvd . Because I live in the Netherlands it is not possible . Its another systeem we have here.
B000K78QVS|5|I've had this classic Vollenweider album on CD for many years but it's even more compelling on vinyl.  If you have a good turntable and appreciate good sound quality, this vintage Vollenweider is well worth the price of admission. This album is an audiophile favorite and a classic in it's own right.
B00422LESO|5|This is the perfect light hearted story for a lazy day. I would have loved to read more! Oh, you will be left with a strong desire to watch Pride and Prejudice again.
B00000J8EK|5|From the very first song, starting with the huge bass rumble, moving into the high twangy beats, I was hooked on the CD.  If you've got a system worth listening to in your car, this CD is gonna get a lot of play!  Its still decent if you don't, but you won't get the full effect!  FYI, they  got a concert at the aragon ballroom (chicago) on the 19th of July with  FBS!
B006LSZECO|4|This book kept my interestall the way thru, although the last quarter got stranger and stranger.  I ended up hating the main character Amy.
B000A2RRF4|4|I really liked this concert on video. I have allways enjoyed Michaels music and his talent to dance is just amazing. I would recommend this if you are a fan of Michael and want to see a good concert and the ending well I wont give it away..
B00BN2NY48|5|Awesome, incredibly beautiful and artistic
B00D7Z4GQY|4|We never know how our lives can or will intersect with others' lives, and this book took me from wondering where we were going to how poignant and often senseless these intersections and decisions will be later on.
B0007OCG56|3|This movie is worthwhile for the opportunity to watch the Spanish actress Paz Vega as Flor.  She is beautiful, and charming, although her character in this movie is a bit predictable.  The other main characters I found offensive, but perhaps that is part of the plot.    Sandler has a problem completing a sentence.  He plays a wimpish character who, as Flor said, acts like a old Mexican housewife.  And Leoni's character was too abrasive, abusive, stupid and self-preoccupied to be believed.  That she and Sandler and their two children were part of the same family just did not make any sense, either in real life or in fiction.    The movie barely had a story line, so without interesting characters there is nothing there.  But watch it just to see Paz Vega.

031603441X|5|The book itself is pristine. The writing is really good. This is possibly the best biographical book dealing musicians ever. It is not chapter after chapter of sensationalism. KR in his in his interviews appears to be incoherent, though if one listens closely he is anything but. This book gives us a view of his musical prowess as well as his personal development plus a little scandal too. Well worth having, great read.

B006ID6NDQ|4|This was an amazing first person account, told in a very straight forward manner, describing events that seem as if from fiction. This is the account of what one Jewish woman went through to survive Nazi Germany. Memory is of course fallible, and it could be that there are descriptions that are not 100% accurate, given the time and the stress factors. The author/survivor also had a trove of letters and documents saved from that time that I'm sure make her memoirs more accurate than others .  Let this book be added to the evidence that words do matter , that hate talk leads to hate crimes, persecution and destruction.  Let us be expansive with the talk of love, understanding, patience and peace. This is the kind of talk that will make the world more livable.  Spread the love.
B00DR0PDNE|3|The Chromecast works well with my mac book pro with Chrome Browser.  However, when I use it with Android phone, the video playback is jittery.  It is possible because the video player that I am using on my Android have the Chromecast stream option.  I had to mirror the Android screen to Chromecast to watch video.  YouTube works good with Chromecast.
B0040I09RM|4|Peg Bundy never looked so good, nice to see Segal's range
B009AHWM5A|5|Liked this much better than the last one. The big bads in this one were truly scary.
B000068OCS|5|Looking at previous reviews, I thought it appropriate to mention the comments on the film being \\"dated\\".  Well, it is.  So is Casablanca.  In fact, so is that milk you have in your fridge.  What's important is the chord the film strikes in you (if any), and whether that message transcends time.  I believe that it still does.  Oddly enough, as our cultures and styles are ever-changing, the items that people tend to think date this film now appear to be more fashionable again. <br /> <br />The simplest review that I can offer to you is to simply watch this film.  Even if, having sat part-way through it, the images have not provoked thought, at least watch the film to its end. Then, reflect back on it as a whole, and how it built action and tension as it meandered through our existence.  Like all things in life, not everybody will like this film; but again, like all things in life, do not judge until you have given it a fair chance.

B006LSZECO|4|Great read
B0062NAX1U|4|Couageous is a celebration of fatherhood.  It offers several situations of fathers.  The story is based on Christian principals which is very refreshing.  It is touching but a little cheesy.
B00E8KLWB4|5|The games is fun with some difficulty.  I really enjoy it.
B0081SRJSY|5|My girlfriend and I are always trying to find kindle fire games we can play together. This one really hit the spot - it is easy to learn, yet has the potentially for deeper strategy.<br /><br />If you don't know the table top board game Carcassone, check out the wikipedia entry on it. This is a faithful  electronic version.
0470901071|4|Great resource for you if you want to teach yourself Cisco.  I only wish they had some good simulations to go with the software.p
B00DR0PDNE|5|I love this gadget . I just ordered another one . It took less than 5 minutes to set up and I was casting a tab to my tv while doing something else on another page. .Its  better than using an HDMI cable which limits mobility in this wireless age.. I stream all of my tv content from the internet ,which is the new way to watch tv,therefore eliminating cable. GET THIS GADGET. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT.
0783229526|5|Those are the final words of Hunter S. Thompson's masterpiece non-fiction/fiction novel which blew minds when it first hit the presses in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine in 1971, and continues to do so to this very day.  The film version does NOT end with those words, but I feel that those words sum it up quite well.    This film is an amazing adaptation of that indispensable piece of American literature...quite possibly the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen.  The events depicted in the film, though sometimes scrambled about for the sake of fluidity (if it can be called that), were all taken directly from the book (except for the CHP trooper asking Thompson for a kiss...that wasn't in the book), and most of the voice-over monologues and character dialogue are taken verbatim.  Of course, several elements from the book were left out, but what can you expect in a two-hour film?  This is a lavish, utterly faithful adaptation of Thompson's book with incredible performances.    Johnny Depp's performance is dead-on to the point of being absolutely frightening.  True, he's a bit too short, but who cares?  In appearance, mannerism, expression, voice, and charisma, Johnny Depp may as well BE Hunter Thompson (or Raoul Duke, if you will).  Depp had met Hunter and spent a night at his ranch prior to being contracted to play the part.  In fact, it was Thompson who suggested that he do the film.  He spent four months at Thompson's ranch, eventually leaving with Hunter's car and his clothes (many of which hadn't been washed in 30 years)...and apparently, he also left with Hunter's mind...or, at least, enough of it to virtually BECOME him onscreen.    Benicio del Toro is also fantastic in this film, having gained some 45 pounds in 10 weeks in order to play Thompson's Chicano lawyer friend, Oscar Acosta.  These two play their parts for everything they're worth and the end result is astounding.    It is my theory that anyone who has seen this film and didn't like it has never read the book.  Why?  Because if you've read the book and loved it, you will love this movie.  And if you've read the book and hated it, you wouldn't bother WATCHING this movie in the first place...would you?    So the bottom line is that if you've read Hunter Thompson's seminal masterwork and adored it, as I did, you will not be disappointed by this film adaptation...it delivers the goods in a way that very few film adaptations can.  Truly, it seems inconceivable that a work like \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" could translate so well to the screen...but somehow, it does.    It's interesting to note that most of the reviews here give the film a 4 or 5 star rating...with a few 1 star ratings here and there. Also interesting to note that almost every person who gave the film 1 star seems to have no idea that it was ever a book, or that it's based on a true story. Out of the 100 or so reviews I read, I found only 1 negative review that mentioned the book. These people don't even know that HST really exists...otherwise, why would they all complain that Johnny Depp's acting is \\"horrible,\\" or \\"the worst acting of his career\\" when, in fact, his performance as HST is flawless?    If you haven't read Thompson's book, you might still get something from this film (a few laughs, at the very least), but if you feel lost at the end, you might want to give the book a read and then come back to the film...it will make more sense once you get the full story.  Of course, it will never make complete sense.  I mean, good God, man...what does?
B00DR0PDNE|1|NEEDS DISCLOSURE: You neglected to mention that it was  not compatible with Windows Surface 2. As it, it's useless to me.
B008G8SFGO|2|I can say that Hell Or Hallelujah, Wall of Sound, Long Way Down & The Devil is Me are good songs & were enough to bump this up to a 2nd star. However, as was the case with Sonic Boom it has a fraudulent feeling behind it. Did they hire Eric for his ability to sound like Peter when singing? Did they hire Tommy for his ability to play in Aces style? It sure looks like it except these guys are happy with one song per album. An imitation is still an imitation no matter how close it is. Egos & greed have taken over & I'm personally sick of hearing all 4 of the original members talk trash on each other. I'll pass on the $4,000 companion book as well, thanks anyway. It was time to say goodby when they said \\"farewell\\" back in 2001! Where does it end? Will we soon be exposed to an official \\"KISS\\" touring the country in make-up with no original members? I'd like to hear Tommy playing in his own style instead of trying to sound like Ace during his solos. He sounded nothing like Ace when he was in Black N Blue. If I want to hear Ace I'll listen to Ace.
B00IUBXPEY|5|Didn't think I'd read these and then loved them and have read twice.
B000MZHW40|5|all was good, quality + timing. I would recomend this comp to everyone thinkng bout buying from them. Thank you vary much. !!
B005LAII3U|3|Being a big fan of the original Total Recall, I wasn't sure how I felt about them making an updated version, especially because the original is now on Blu-ray and looks amazing. I decided to check this out and see how it fared.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br />The visuals in this movie are great. I really like the world they created, and the digital effects are very convincing. The set design, costumes and make-up are all first rate, and I have to give props to the designers for creating an imaginative and convincing future. The director also has an eye for interesting composition, and frames the movie well. This movie was fantastic to look at. Comparing this to other Blu-rays on the market, the clarity and fidelity are superb. The action sequences are pretty intense, so if you like lots of firefights and explosions, this shouldn't disappoint. The music and sound effects are fitting, and the audio quality is what you've come to expect from a Blu-ray disc. I don't have 5.1 surround, just stereo, so I can't comment on surround sound, but in stereo is sounded fine.<br /><br />THE MEH<br />The acting is not bad. Nothing stood out, but there weren't any particularly bad actors that distracted from the film. I am a big fan of Breaking Bad, so I especially enjoyed seeing Bryan Cranston as the villain, but he wasn't given enough screen time to stretch is acting chops beyond, \\"Hi, I'm the bad guy\\". I have no opinion of Colin Farrell one way or the other, but in this movie he did a decent job. As the lead, he held his own, but just barely. Everyone else was forgettable.<br />Another area that could have used some work is the pacing. The film seems to be in 5th gear the whole time, and refuses to let up even at the end. The problem this creates is that it becomes a predictable pattern. Characters give a little bit of uninteresting exposition, then a 20 minute chase ensues, replete with gunfire and explosions, then they have a 2 minute breather with more exposition, then another 20 minute chase, then exposition, then chase, and so on. Without proper pacing, the \\"big revelation\\" of who Douglas Quaid really is, followed by another \\"big revelation\\", has no impact on the audience because the actors seem too exhausted from the last 20 minute chase to really give a darn.<br /><br />THE BAD<br />This script is seriously lacking. There are no memorable lines, with the exception of lines borrowed from the 1990 film, and there's even a few scenes that makes small nods to the original film, which only serve to remind you of how much this version is lacking. There are three big problems with the script. First, it focuses way to heavily on the action sequences, and barely leaves room for story and character development. Second, the dialogue is really boring. Characters don't have anything particularly interesting to say, and don't have a clever or engaging way of saying it. I felt more like the characters were reading a synopsis off the back of the box rather than having natural conversations. Third, the story is too thin. This is really apparent when you compare it to the original. So much happened in that movie, so many twists and turns, so many interesting locations, so many characters, and they all seemed to have personality and purpose. The new Total Recall strips away the layers of depth from the original and all we're left with is a skeleton of a plot, a 2 hour movie with 6 minutes of story and 114 minutes of gunfire.<br />One final gripe, and this is more personal preference than anything else, but the characters seem invincible. Throughout the movie, dozens of trained police officers with semi-automatic weapons fire at the protagonists, miss every shot, then the protagonists will fire a couple shots and hit their mark flawlessly every time. Some of these police officers are robots, and even they miss. You'd think if they can build robots in the future, they could program some competent auto-aim software as well. It got pretty ridiculous in one scenewhere Quaid is surrounded by nearly 100 police officers in a building lobby, all of them aiming assault weapons at him and his partner. Logically the two protagonists surrender, since fleeing would be suicide. But then after a brief conversation, the two flee anyway and escape without a scratch. 100 cops, that have them completely surrounded and have been aiming at them for the last five minutes, are unable to hit two people standing in the middle of an open lobby in broad daylight!? WHAT?<br /><br />OVERALL<br />If you like seeing special effects in High Definition, rent this movie. It looks pretty, but it's not very memorable. If you don't already own the 1990 original, go buy that one.
B007SGM084|5|The best of the best!! Absolutely am obsessed and in love<br /> with this story! Find myself constantly 're reading it. Can't wait for more!
B00AIQP9DE|5|Great graphics and storyline.  Developer has achieved a good balance between puzzle difficulty and narrative flow.  Play for free then buy to support a worthy game developer.
B00005JKHN|5|Perfect transaction very enjoyable movie.
B00AUAL9T6|5|Great movie
055357342X|5|This entire series is by far, the best I've read! At the end of each chapter it hooks you. Unexpected surprises at every turn. And unexpected deaths at every turn. The twists and the plots were well thought out. The charachters were well written and I have my favorites. I can't say enough about these books! I'm a HUGE fan!
B00HGJ18C2|5|Cool...New to this game..Love it.
B000PGTPE6|3|Its ok but not the rock and roll i expect out of bruce. Listen once in a while and interesting. Afterall do we fans expect him not to want to do something new once in a while.
B00DVZ414C|5|It is a perfect gift for a folk music collector!
B00B7G3NFU|4|It would definitely be a part of Seth Mc Farlanes sophomoric song...but such a good story! Loved the performances of all of the actors!
B0084IG8TM|4|kids loved this movie
B00E8KLWB4|4|I love mysteries and play some times not often due to work hours
0143038419|5|I wish I was her - I would love to have this life and travel her travels!!!  So jealous of her spirituality. Take advantage of time away and dive into this book
B00000JBCP|5|Let's talk about what they ARE.  Mana is the best band current.  On this CD they don't back off- they do all of their most socially relevant songs -- about the burning of the rain forest, teenage pregnancy, street  children, political prisoners, yet also include their most romantic ballads  about lost love.  I don't see how anyonone can complain about this album.   Plus, it's live ( if not COMPLETELY &quot; unplugged&quot;, it does include  a lot of acoustics)  Sorry-- it is a MUST have.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Who are you? Sarah Manning finds herself staring at an exact copy of herself while walking near the tracks at a train station. There is only a moment when they stare at each other and the next thing you know the woman who looks like Sarah walks in front of a train and is killed. If you are a grifter perhaps you will decide, as Sarah did, to steal this woman's identity and clean out her bank account. This is the beginning of Sarah going down the proverbial rabbit hole into a world where she is only one of many clones. You never know which clone will be introduced next, a psycho, suburban housewife, uptight cop, quirky science nerd, who will be next? Sarah must find out how they are connected and why someone is trying to kill them.
B007PTJOV0|5|Frustrated at first but after I got the hang of I was hooked.  Confused at first how lost life but figure that out too.
B004DLPXAO|4|Having all my electronics on one gadget is awesom. So happy everything transferred to my notepad! Love having my books with me.
B005V2EVBQ|4|I've been using the cover for about a month and so far I am satisfied with it. It's easy to open and close and convenient for propping up while I am reading.
B000050XEI|5|Love it.
B000021XS0|5|This album is the best album I have heard from any band in a long time!  I went and saw these guys live last night to a sold out show in Cincinnati. They played the album from beginning to end without any mess ups and just  as clean as it was on the album! Dream Theatre is one of the most talented  bands around and I wish they had more air play than they do. Bands can take  a lesson from every one of these musicians! They are trully talented and  this album is a must!  Sit back, relax, and let James and the boys take  you back to Metropolis..10..9..8...7..6..5..4..3..2..1 You're enetring a  safe place now! It's Dream Theatre like never before!  Enjoy!
B000E1ZBGS|1|Well, I suppose I should be happy they didn't give it a rock soundtrack. This was a major disappointment. I'd been so excited when the director said he was giving the story more \\"muscle.\\" Um, not really. Apparently, in his view, Lizzie is an inarticulate, sullen, pouty anorexic. The Bennet family are hillbillies. Wow, who knew? I detest big budget phony movies, such as this. Every scene dripped with insincerity.  <br /> <br />I actually enjoyed most of the actors, even Darcy. I found it pathetic, however, that the witty, insightful words of Austen were deemed inferior to the hack screenwriter's cliches. And wow! Talk about historical inaccuracies. The country gentry of the era were cleaner than this. They may not have bathed every day...but they were neat and presentable. Clothing was handsewn and fitted with great care (sewing machines hadn't been invented yet) and they certainly fit better than the hanging, ragged smocks worn by these actors. <br /> <br />Oh, and the biggest laugh? Oh, my goodness! The last scene in the U.S. version was a direct steal from the 80's movie \\"Sixteen Candles.\\" Unbelievable!
B0017I1IZA|5|please more of stephanie
B00008PX8P|5|Five stars do not give this remarkable set the justice it deserves. I got into them at age 16 when I first purchased the box set, and then had to go out and get the remaining songs that werent on it.  This however is the total collection for live performances as well as rare interviews.  I mean come on it has over 5 hours of great material and a better set list than The Song Remains The Same.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.
B004FRX0MY|4|I love it...thk you!
B003TNW044|5|Got this for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loves it and she watches it all the time. There's some extra scenes or deleted scenes or something like that that she liked about this. Came as expected. Super satisfied :)
B0055SWM08|5|the game is excellent but I bought this when it was .99. I could have saved a buck. ;) blah blah blah.
B00168HARG|5|Love this show! I'm very sad that it got cancelled.<br /><br />These blu-rays do not have any type of &#34;menu&#34;. When you put one in, it just immediately starts playing one episode after the other.
B00J2PCCYQ|5|My daughter has been wanting to watch this movie for ever!!!! I love it the way it just touches your heart..... we have watched four times so far this is a movie that I would defiantly buy to add to our Disney collection of movies!!!!!!!
B008Y77O4G|4|Good movie. Sometimes hard to keep up with but enjoyed it tremendously.
B00VXGTJMU|5|This is a really good CD.  The lyrics for the Johny Cash song are a little weak, but the music is great.  I like the beat, its easy to dance to, I give it a 22.  (For those who remember Dick Clark's American Bandstand that last part should bring a smile/)
0399165274|1|A long time fan of FF...read 'em all. THEKILL LISTis  his the nadir of his talent .My recommendation to all of his fans is \\"SAVE YOUR MONEY\\"
B00008S2VG|2|I am not sure where to start with this review, but I should begin by saying that I am a huge Madonna fan and have been since I was a mere child dancing to Material Girl in my living room. I have literally fallen head over heels both times with her last two albums, RAY OF LIGHT and MUSIC....however, I haven't felt even the slightest tingle of joy or love for this new album. Madonna seems to once again take on the Mirwais styled sound stylings that are getting a little old now and the beats seem to get a little repetitive and lack the usual catchy quality that her songs have seemed to have in her last albums. Some of the songs confuse me and others leave me feeling weirded out by Madonna's strange lyrical content. I gave the cd 2 stars instead of just 1 because I feel that Madonna stuck by what she believed in and made an album that was personal and liberating and I give her credit for that. I love Madonna with a firey passion but this album will not be getting much play from me unfortunatly. Hopefully, her next one will be a little better and have more catchy hooks and better lyrics to the songs. I have to stay true and be honest about this cd...I'm sorry guys, I am just not that big of a fan of it!! :(
B008BQ8VOC|5|Just riviting, outstanding and once again very well written. Emotions were high and got down to the core of some of the characters.
B00CO5AQ12|5|Sand!!
B00J2PCCYQ|5|We loved the movie.  Watched it with my granddaughter.  We loved Olaf.  Wonderful visual effects.  Would highly recommend this movie.
B008GJV19Q|5|Fun, full of mysticism floating through the story, loved it.  Only complaint - I craved chocolate.
B000B5MI3Q|2|This watch jumps 30 seconds ahead each day and it is only 3 months old.  Seiko told me that 20 seconds a day is \\"acceptable\\".  I don't find this acceptable.  I have owned other automatic watches and have never experienced this.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this watch unless you don't care about knowing what time it is!
0575078022|4|It moves quickly and doesn't fall into the trap of being obvious.  It reads well.  Ultimately it is just genre fiction though.  That isn't a put-down -- I certainly haven't written anything anywhere near as good.  I just mean that you'll grab another book from the pile and move on.  You'll remember \\"Lies\\" and probably recommend it to friends, but I don't think that two years from now you'll return to it.
B00006V9A0|4|A few real good songs and some very offensive ones.
B009NF54ZE|4|I think it was a good game  just a little too repeatitive.  I did enjoy the hidden object needs to have more items to find
B00RGQ4674|3|Interesting time travel and legends
B0050DIWFC|5|Different from what I have ever read.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I truly enjoy this season, but I was truly sad when Matthew died. It will be interesting to see where the show goes.
B0021L8V0M|5|We had this movie once and it somehow disappeared. My hubby has been trying to find it for about a year. He was so happy when he got it again. I think he's watched it about three or four times now. He loves this movie.
B00GGW0E0C|5|This has always been one of my favorite albums. I already own it on cd. What a great treat it was to get it for 3.99. Listened to it that day while I was out running errands. Made the trip a upbeat one.
B009E3EY38|5|Excellent. Thx!
1501106422|5|It is written with compassion for Alice who is diagnosed with early onsel Alzheimers. It journeys with Alice through all her pain and what her family goes through. It is an easy read and even though it is a sad story it is an awesome read. This is a true story.
B0073CCYAM|5|It's a little smaller than I expected, but just what I wanted.
B000001IPL|3|If you know the offspring at all, you know what to expect from this album.  If you don't, here it is: above average rock hymns worth humming to yourself to psyche yourself up with.  \\"Come Out and Play\\" and \\"Self Esteem\\" are probably the two best songs the Offrspring have ever produced.  Overall this album will not revolutionize your music library, but it will add some fun solid rock music worth listening to with the music cracked up.  I don't think this album could disappoint you too much unless you're really expecting far too much from this band, but it might just entertain you a bit more than you'd expect.  Relax, sit back, don't over think this effort and just enjoy the noise.
B00AIUUXHC|5|It's a bright and colorful game, spirited in many ways. Very expansive with a variety of aquatic life. Shark upgrades are awesome, so are the manta rays, anglerfish, gold rushes, and undoubtably more I'll discover. Thanks Future Games!
B00KA7JIII|5|visual is very innovative
B001UV4XJ2|1|The movie is fine, the problem is the digital copy is unuseable. Every digital movie I have purchased in the past 5 years has either come with a physical file or an iTunes download, not the case with this product. You are forced to download some lame Flixster software to your computer, it will not play in iTunes at all. Want to watch it on your apple TV you're screwed, grab your family and huddle around the laptop. Want to watch it on your ipad or iphone, you have to download the flixster app, and have an internet connection, because it only plays via streaming. Want to watch it on a plane you are screwed and out of luck.
B00J2PCCYQ|3|as expected , good movie
0194314243|5|No other book on my bookshelf is more worn out. I use it all the time. When I started to study English I used to use an English / Portuguese (my first language) dictionary but I could only actually improve my English when I started using the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary.<br />The dictionary has lots of pictures (over 1700) for words that can be explained but for which a picture is much more effective like &quot;hinge&quot;. The words have a pronunciation guide with a mark (') showing the main stress. There are many useful appendixes like irregular verbs conjugation, usage of numbers, punctuation, family relationships and a few colorful maps.<br />Over 220 usage notes clarify the subtle differences among words such as dealer trader and merchant. Although it's mainly a British English dictionary the differences in spelling, use or pronunciation between American English and British English are stressed.<br />By far the most interesting feature is the extremely reduced defining vocabulary constituted of 3500 words. The great majority of definitions are written using that reduced defining vocabulary. This simplifies the definitions and it's a great starting vocabulary for the beginners. The use of such a small defining vocabulary rules out the use of this dictionary as a thesaurus but the advantages compensate this drawback.<br />My copy is a paper back that has been reinforced with adhesive tape. This makes the dictionary lighter and handy. I used to put it on my back pack and take it to all my classes when I started college in USA.<br />The drawbacks are the need of an additional thesaurus and the fact that the entries are not syllabified. Nevertheless I would give it 10 stars if I could.<br />Leonardo Alves - December 2000
0151013837|5|It's a great story, very imaginative.  I gave this copy to my sister after I finished it.  Books are just better when they are shared with others.
B00AMBLXP8|5|Initially I did not think I would like this, based on the trailers for the movies.  It was hysterical and I urge you to watch it, silly, funny, endearing and well worth watching.

1439102813|5|I was very impressed with the accuracy of the information and the approach from the point of view of the alzitheimers patient.
0316666343|5|A lot of readers dont know that Alice Sebold was raped when she was in college. I think its amazing that she can write books about something so close to her. I know a lot of readers didnt like the idea of susie and ruth switching places but I'm sure Alice Sebold thought alot about what would of happened if she died that night. Its a very nice thought to come back for a day and be with your loved ones. And even though it may not be realistic it gives hope to some readers. I think Alice Sebold is a fantastic writer and people should take the book for what it is not compare it to something else. If you want a more realistic story read Lucky : A Memoir also by Alice Sebold which is a non fiction story..her story <br />
B00BIPCY14|5|I'm hooked on The Good Wife!!!  Such great writing. I'm looking forward to watching the upcoming seasons.

B007VUA7VO|5|THIS IS A GREAT APP TO HAVE. IT TELLS ME EVERYTHING I WANT TO KNOW! NOT ONLY DOES IT PROVIDE YOU WITH EXACTLY HOW MUCH BATTERY LIFE YOU HAVE LEFT, BUT IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE EXACT AMOUNT OF TIME YOU HAVE FOR READING TIME, PHONE TIME, MUSIC TIME ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION. SO YES, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS, IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND WANT TO KNOW HOW LONG YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU NEED TO JUICE UP!! :) BASICALLY, IT ACTS LIKE YOUR COMPUTER BATTERY ICON BY GIVING THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME FOR YOUR DEVICE. IT`S A WONDERFUL APP........ BRAVO TO THE CREATOR!
B00EHMFC78|2|This was more like three almost disconnected short stories woven into each other. I like these characters adn I liked the bad guy (girl) but I wasn't able to engage with them in this one. The whole training thing was boring and most of all the actions of the deputy were not believable.
B002NWRMVS|5|This one is great!
0739308726|4|I am not that far along in this book yet, but I LOVE IT!! Mr. Dotrice does a fantastic job of reading it and helps bring Martin's characters to life (I have the audio edition).  As always, Martin leaves you hanging with one character as he then wets your whistle by catching you up on a character he left you behind with earlier.  I cannot wait to get in my car every day just so I can follow along on the next journey.   <br />     I am actually not a fantasy reader by nature and started the series not only because my co-workers recommended it, but I got tired of being out of the loop as they discussed it constantly.  I started the series believing I would dislike it because it was a fantasy book.  However, Martin really grabbed me from the start and I have needed no further proding to catch myself up to speed.   <br /> <br />*Side notes:  This is the third book in a series that begins with A Game of Thrones.  The second is A Clash of Kings.  Martin can get graphic, gore and sex, in portions of the novel and this series may not be for younger readers or those who may find those scenes offensive.

0446677450|2|This is a an interesting read but do not pay a penny for it. This falls under the category of info-tainment, but does have valuable information if taken lightly. I would hate to think of all the people that failed trying his knuckle head antics. The failure rate I am sure is high, but who's real problem is that anyway!! <br /> <br />If indeed any of his quaint stories are factual, he is not a normal person, and probably exagerates his business success greatly prior to these books. I would probably be right making even stronger statements.  <br /> <br />It does not take a genious to make great real estate investments in a booming aloha land. Peopel line up in lotteries to bu 400K+ 1200 sq ft houses with out even knowing what lot they might get. <br /> <br />If you are brave enough to strike out on your own this book plays to the emotional aspects.
B008NABUU8|5|its a game that is dum and slow just like me therefore u should get it I I I I I I I i
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is very good. The graphics are very good and the gameplay is worthy of 5 stars. The music is also as good.
B00062RCBW|5|Great series. I enjoyed watching it.
B00122HT04|5|This is a hard rocking album that has great riffs and awesome vocals. If you like A7X, or never listened to them, this would be a great album to start on.
B009XIXVU6|5|Another absolute gem. Makes you think! Hope Khaled has many more wonderful stories in him. Each book makes you more aware of the complex issues in Afghanistan.
B00012QKSI|5|The CD that I purchased was just as described and perfect in every way.  Thanks again and I'll look forward to repeat business with you!
B00O6K888G|5|Best like album

B0026P3G12|5|Wonderful CD; heartwarming, soothing, great choice of music; however, CD cases (I had ordered 2) were received broken, but CD was not damaged
B00CHIMG6Y|5|I favor movies that are based on true stories. Since the father and mother and their three sons were, in fact, reunited,  this encourages me to believe that the miraculous really does happen.
B00DBSZJRM|5|Love this movie!
B000IZJZLM|5|I recieved my product quickly and in excellent condition.  as always  I am pleased with Amazon business.    Thank you
B007IXWL2C|4|Book 2 was my favorite, but I felt like this book skipped too fast. It also sort of ruined the thought of a 4th book because of the abrupt ending.
B003V4AK8E|1|When I connected it to my ps3 it would say charge complete but when I unplugged it would not turn on also the r1 button was broken
B008Y2FRFO|4|Have fun but the ahhhhhh when things fall over the side get annoying and so I turned off the sound
B003P2WO5E|4|Good book,
B005ZOBNOI|5|Absolutely amazing. Heart felt and funny, you don't forget it. It changes how you see life...what life looks like from the perspective of those who are sick
B00003CWL6|1|This movie has bad acting and an even worse storyline.  Fortunately, I don't give a crap for low high school girls who complain and whine that their breasts are 2 mm smaller than the average or about a crazy guy who video tapes people who is the son of an even crazier military officer.  Who cares about a movie that is all about teen sex?  A lot more than you think.  Who cares about a person being in Seventeen magazine?  A lot more than you think.  But this movie is not compelling, just plain stupid and way too long.  I can't give you enough reasons not to watch this film.  Take my advice, don't get this film.  But you can ignore it and face over two hours of torture or over two hours of napping time.
B00LXLM05I|5|Fun for dybgeon crawlers!
B00IUBM8PQ|3|ok.  kind of boring.

B000002U9E|5|I jumped on the Kate Bush bandwagon relatively late, after a chance run-in with \\"Wuthering Heights\\".  That song is great, but, comparatively, the rest of the album it comes from (The Kick Inside) doesn't measure up.  Nonetheless, I'd heard good things about Hounds of Love and decided to give it a chance.  It is easily the best album that I have picked up in the past few years, and probably in my top five CDs of all time.   <br /> <br />Before I get into the particulars of Hounds of Love, though, I should the inevitable comparison with Tori Amos.  I'm not particularly fond of Tori, but I can see how much Kate Bush has influenced her, and, to be honest, several songs MUSICALLY seem similar to some of Tori's stuff.  The real differentiation comes with the lyrics.  Tori is a kook, writing songs using the first stream of consciousness idea that pops into her head.  This ends up making the listener completely apathetic to songs like \\"Silent All These Years\\" or \\"Hey Jupiter,\\" which surfacely sound very pretty and emotional.  On the other hand, Kate Bush has the ability to write universal lyrics that are genuinely emotive and touching, without seeming overdone or trite.  It is this unparalleled talent that makes Hounds of Love so good. <br /> <br />Anyway, Hounds of Love is rife with spirituality and well-rounded ruminations on love and relationships.  Sounds like typical fare, but it's so much more.  From \\"Running Up That Hill,\\" an angry yet reticent song about the singer's inability to change her problems, to \\"Mother Stands to Comfort,\\" the first half beautifully represents a cross-section of the speaker's analysis of how messed up her life is.  Then the second half of the album comes, which chronicles the speaker's near death by drowning.  The album ends with two incredibly beautiful songs (\\"Hello Earth\\" and \\"The Morning Fog\\") which convey the idea that, though we may not accept all of our problems all of the time, you may become more aware of how valuable life is whenever it's nearly stripped from you. <br /> <br />The beauty of Hounds of Love is such a simple idea stands behind it--it's something we've all thought about.  Kate Bush just puts it together so elegantly and beautifully, and I think this is the reason why, as a concept album, it is one of the few I've ever found to be generally moving and thought-provoking.  All in all, you cannot go wrong buying this album--it's pretty much flawless.  (I say \\"nearly\\" because I know tons of people who think \\"Jig of Life\\" is one of the stupidest songs ever recorded.  While I like it, it is quite ambitious and the Celtic thing doesn't really fit on the album thematically, so I can kind of see their point.)
B000HBK3MM|2|I ain't saying Billie Holiday was untouchable, but this gal can't seem to sing a whole song without going falsetto.  She sounds more like a Ricki Lee Jones impersonator, with less range.  Can you say \\"flash in the pan\\"?
B0067TGSOK|5|This is a Very cool book that gave me lots of great ideas for my future social enterprise. Great interviews and fascinating stories!
B00DUGCLY4|5|I love this game so much because you can guess what 's on the picture its  sssssssssssssooooooooooooo fun to play this game!
B005ZOBNOI|5|I felt like I was in the book and that it was very romantic. All I can say is that I loved it!😄
B008Y7N7JW|5|We love having amazon prime instant video! It is much better than Netflix since sometimes it would take forever to playback or go forward and buffering would take forever. But not w/ prime!
B00E8KLWB4|5|I like this game

B004GJDQT8|5|Can't beat the prices
B0015AARJI|1|Received this controller fast and in original casing .  Synced fine and worked fine.  Problem was after i was done using the pre charge it came with , and it was time to plug in.  It didn't charge. ruining the review. Instead of progressing battery bars on the menu.<br />It showed  a dead dash. No charging battery icon at all. It looked just like a dash for example.  (  -  )  .<br />Contacted sony support after 30 min of trying to resolve with resetting and different cords.  We came to the conclusion that it lied  in the  DC 5V  voltage stated on the back of the controller as i mentioned to the tech expert.  i told her that my other controller worked fine with the cords . The only difference was that it was your normal  3.7V  controller. So  she told me to contact this seller and ask for a refund or a replacement with a  new 3.7V instead of the 5V.  so thats what im doing . She also mentioned that she never really heard of this problem nor why they would make a controller that wont charge.  Ps3 works fine USB ports in fine condition. problem? the charging?  Does anyone else have a 5V  controller? if so also have this problem ?  replys greatly appreciated.

1423113462|5|vocabulary is a great tool for kids as well as the lore and ledgends son love the writer and series
B00HDMMISA|5|At first I was put off by the many characters.  It didn't seem serious enough for me.  But I kept reading and more and more I was drawn into the characters and the surprising twists the author included.  Eventually, I was unable to put it down.  Wonderful story, uniquely written.
B000FC146C|5|This book gets better & better every time I read it.
B005HWIU4Y|5|Hilarious. Some Christian/Catholic bashing, which is so off putting, but at least it's kept somewhat in context here. It's even kind of funny because it is sarcastic and not malicious and completely gratuitous. And those parts are relatively minor. All in all: hilarious. Ben Stiller's at his best with a strong supporting cast. Everyone is excellent.
B0042RJWTC|4|I love historical fiction. But I also like knowing how much of a story is based on fact in order to keep the fictional aspects in perspective. When I first watched \\"Rome\\", I was initially incensed at the writer's use of modern profanity thinking that people wouldn't have used the \\"f\\" word in that time period, but quickly realized they probably did, only it would have been an Roman/Italian version. And of course, they didn't speak English either, in which case I wouldn't (as an English-only speaker) have related as easily to a movie all in Italian. As for the accuracy of the storyline, it was close enough to inspire me to research the real historical events that framed the fictional story presented and I was better off for it. The same for \\"The Tudors.\\"    Much has been said here about the historical truths (and fictions) of Showtime's \\"The Tudors.\\" Of course there are many inaccuracies and inventions in the script just as there are in any period production - some deliberate but perhaps unnecessary. There are also silly, unintentional mistakes that can be spotted in the visuals and choices of music. But since this is a made for television series, one has to admit, it's entertaining and sumptuously made in spite of those errors and inaccuracies. If, after watching or reading any work of historical fiction, you are one of those who is inspired to sort out the real from the fiction as am I, here is a link to a website that can help you put \\"The Tudors\\" in perspective.

B00IG2DOKM|5|Love this game.
B00CO8TA4I|5|Fast, reliable, quite, fan was easy to install. Perfect. Quality product. Just make sure you get the 1150 motherboard. This is a another quality product from intel.

B002TYZKIM|5|Always good to witness a master at his work!  Watch the film clear through to the ending of the credits!  Save the Earth!
B000023VR6|5|Dr Dre, one of the most influential figures the rap industry for the past decade has unleashed a masterpiece that rivals \\"The Chronic\\" as one of the greatest rap albums ever put together.  Dre brings out a host of guests onto this collaberation, such as Xzibit, Snoop Dogg, Hittman, Kurupt, Eminem, Knoc-turn'al, and a nice visit by Mary J Blige in \\"The Message.\\"  This amazing cast really brings the album to life, with Dre's simple yet amazingly deep beats truly make this album a classic.<br />This album is so deep it is incredible.  22 tracks make up the mammoth of a project, with a few interludes scattered here and there.  Besides the unnecessary \\"Pause 4 Porno,\\" they are all relevant and really express on the gangsta theme that is somewhat lightened up from \\"The Chronic.\\"  No filler songs are present, as they are all of extremely high-quality.  It is a testament to how much work was put into this when it could be said that the album would still be a great album even without the top 5 songs on it.  Amazing job by Dre.<br />Top 5 Songs:<BR>1) Still Dre (featuring Snoop Dogg)<BR>2) The Next Episode (featuring Snoop Dogg)<BR>3) Forgot About Dre (featuring Eminem)<BR>4) Let's Get High (featuring Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms Roq)<BR>5) What's The Difference (featuring Eminem and Xzibit)<br />All in all, an incredibly feat brought forth by one of rap's all time greatest.  Dre has created a masterpiece, one that will stay in the halls of rap's finest.
B00008HCCF|5|Great video good quality. Nice to put a face with the voice.
B005PK57IK|4|Season 3 is very good.  There's less emphasis on the kids and homelife, but more attention given to Alisha and Peter's relationship.  There's a lot more Eli (which is good,) and Alisha and Kalinda have some conflict (which is &#34;mixed.&#34;)  Kalinda starts having some problems, and isn't as &#34;invulnerable&#34; as she's been in past seasons.<br /><br />I'm continuing to watch, and am looking forward to seeing Season 4.
B008CP6RWU|5|An amazing game!
B002MQYOFW|5|it was hard to put the book down. It's action packed, and full of emotion. Can't wait to start book 2!
B00GH75V1S|5|Great movie I would suggest anyone to watch this. Matt Damon always makes good movies and this is  one of them.
B00JJHDX9A|3|It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't as good as the first one. I think, like many others have said, that it missed the mark because it is the middle section of the trilogy; there was no sense of beginning, middle, end for this film. Unlike the Lord of the Ring trilogy, where each movie could have stood on it's own without any previous knowledge of the story or the film before.<br /><br />Anyone who has not read this book or seen the first movie recently, will probably find themselves utterly lost and confused with the goings on in Smaug.<br /><br />I'm interested to see how Mr. Jackson manages a third, three hour film with the remaining content. The movie leaves off with only a few chapters left in the book, so I fear we are going to get a lot of contrived bits to fill in the gaps.
B00004XONN|5|Radiohead is one of the few bands whose music evolves dramatically from albmum to album. &quot;OK Computer&quot; already was a big leap forward. With &quot;Kid A&quot;, they leave the realm of classic songwriting and go into a more avantgardistic or even experimental direction. The music is now much more electronic than before, and contains extensive soundscapes that can draw the listener into hypnotic trance. This album is difficult to listen to, and you need some degree of inner calmness to &quot;breathe&quot; it in - then it will carry you away into the open space.
B007T8BYWE|3|It isn't as bad as the store flippix for solving, but it is short.  It has only four is so question marks per scene.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is great. Each level is unique and very challenging. It is a very effective stress reliever. Thanks Candy Crush!
0345803507|5|Loved the story but the explicit sex could have been a litle less explicit.  Love the characters of Christian and Anna.
B00JH3S0AI|1|not worth the time!
B00NEQRNVG|2|I have enjoyed reading the Crossfire Series, but I want closure. I like how the writer made this book reflect both Gideon' s P.O.V. and Eva's P.O.V., but it is getting ridiculous. This book was good, but it really seems like the writer can goon and on and stretch the series even further. Initially this book series was a trilogy, now it's a what? Give us closure. We like their story, but you could have ended it with three or even four books. I honestly felt like I could have learned everything from this entire book in five chapters. And although I understood Eva's conflict and issues with Gideon; it feels like this was forced to stretch the series. Just end it with a Happy Ever After.<br />Their story is interesting and was good for the first three books, now the writer is grasping. It was refreshing reading both of their point of views, but the lack of closure overshadows any positive feedback I could give. Tell me, do I have to wait until November 2015 or January 2016 to find out how their story ends?<br /><br />  I am an avid book reader. I enjoy reading. When I first read this series, I was excited to see how it would culminate and resolve. I thought the author was brilliant. And I thought about purchasing other books she has wrote. But now, I am pretty sure I will not read any more of this particular author's books, because she can not deliver a complete story in three or four books. Honestly a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />Good luck! And next time, stick to three (pushing it four) books in a series. We lose interest waiting for the book, then reading it only to find out that you want to keep extending the story. After a while, the author begins to grasp at straws and the characters, story, or plot loses its integrity. I do not think I would have minded the series so much if: 1) the writer told me ahead of time, how many books I had to read to find closure; 2) And, all of the books reflected the series (or the final book with both characters P.O.V.'s ended it nicely).
B0020BUWX2|5|I could not stop reading it!!
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Great
B0012PDVUS|3|Not the best scifi, but ok to watch once.  Harrison ford acting is very good as always. Ok to watch once.
B00HERGM86|5|I absolutely LOVE mythology and this is awesome!! Acting is superb and the leads are very good in them. I grew up loving Thor in comics and this movie is satisfying in every way!
B00I0C46BO|5|This book is changing my life as I read it. A gentle, direct method for achieving order in one's life.

B007XKEY6Q|4|Draw Something is a very enjoyable, fun game! I love to draw, so this game is a lot of fun for me. This game deserves 4 stars for its good quality and unique choices to draw, yet sometimes the game closes on its own, and that annoys me. Besides that,  I believe that Draw Something is an enjoyablem addicting game!
B002VWNICW|5|I got it within a timely manner. Love the movie.
B00CXG8Z1K|5|I love this collection of songs.  Enjoyable and relaxing to listen to.  Definitely had to add these songs to my MP3 player so I can listen anywhere.  Awesome!
B00VFTA70I|5|Fascinating
B008602KQI|5|It is rare that the movie follows the book, especially considering the special effects needed for this one.  I enjoyed the movie and all the visuals that reinforced my reading.  Thanks!
B000BVMAJ2|5|This was the perfect toy for my 2 & 4 yr olds.  I highly recommend this toy and their other Lego Dupol sets!
B008IBPMZG|5|Awesome show! I don't know why I didn't start watching it sooner.

0060837020|5|This book is such a glimpse into the mind of someone suffering with depression. I highly recommend reading this, even if you don't suffer from depression, to gain an insight into the lives of those who do. This book is so dear to me I have &#34;I am, I am, I am.&#34; tattooed over my heart.
B008Y2FRFO|5|Its crazy how addictive this simple game has become for me and my kids. Looking forward to completing the puzzles and receiving awards.
B00FAVRHBE|5|The most watched Doctor Who ever and a must for any collection. Great having Tom Baker making an appearance at the end of the movie to setup a new quest for the Doctor.
B00DUGCLY4|4|I love this app. finally a game that includes what everyone loves...emojis!! a must download for everyone who loves puzzles
B009EHDU7U|5|I read all the other reviews and was not put off by references to Forrest Gump and history lessons. I know it stretched the credibility but that was the appeal. It was fresh, different and always readable. I enjoyed it from start to finish.
B00CWY76CC|5|This game is amazing. It is challenging but at the same time so fun! Get if you too love problem solving!
B00FAX6XQC|1|Way too graphic for me.  Ugly, blasting blood.  Really?  Is this necessary?  Why couldn't it just be simply target practice?
B004T2QZL8|4|it would always force close but the game was pretty fun and I wish joybits could fix this :). It kinda ruined the game since I cant play any more and I even tried erasing the app and installing it again but it did not work
006621131X|5|Great book! A well written account of a unique and creative partnership. Patti Smith captures the grit and wonder of the late 60's / 70's New York City art and music world with the charm, wit and tenderness of an extremely talented insider.
B00005B3Z6|5|I was living in England when this series came out (so to speak), and I simply loved it. When I learned of the American version, I was excited, but after intital viewings, felt it to be a disappointment.  Perhaps because I spent time in England, the British version is much better in my eyes. I prefer the Brit actors, and the manner of storytelling, which is less.. uh.. Americanish.  I find the British Vince character to be adorable, while his US counterpart is, at best, a bit irritating. For an anglophile and/or fans of British movies and films, this is sure to please.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|This show is a great show. It's very entertaining, and smart. I really hope they keep this show on the air.
B0021L8V0M|5|Good movie
B0019HQIGS|5|I saw this originally in theaters, and it was more than incredible.  The DVD is just as good at home. I highly reccommend it, it's some of John's greatest work - through the three \\"personalities\\" - acoustic, the trio, and with the band. It's not too expensive either, definitely worth the money!
B006MW3UZW|5|Everybody kept telling me to watch this show, & I was so tired of hearing about it that I finally gave in.  I fully expected it would not live up to the hype, but it is fabulous!  Once you start watching, you can't stop.  The dry British humor is hilarious, the characters are well developed, and the plot keeps you up late watching &#34;just one more.&#34;  I highly recommend this show & series.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Great game with lots of challanges
B000SEGTI0|5|The book is really great, once again it's amazing how is it still up to date released in 1968, all the science fiction elements made so general and abstract the are quite real. The ending with religious philosophy spoils impression a bit as for me and the whole picture is pretty solid. Recommended :-) #classic #scifi
B00KQFXODY|4|This is a very good remake with special effects throughout. Plenty of gunfire, explosions, bad guys.....well paced. Date movie? Not really. Viewing with spouse? My spouse made me turn it off...too much gunfire. Guys only? Yes. Children? NO.
B008RA3X5E|5|I live by this app. I don't think I'd make it to work or get the kids up for school on time or anything else for that matter. The ability to have multiple alarms and turn them on and off without losing them or the notes that go with the I wonderful!
B00DPM90C4|3|The first part of the book was meandering and it was hard to connect the characters but about half way through it began to come together and the ending was rather clouded.
B00EMXBDMA|4|Watch for the movie it should be pretty good as well.
0307719774|3|I sent this back due to some of the questions inside. I felt some of the questions were indicative of immoral nature. We all have moments of poor choices, however I would rather have a journal that focused on positive moments rather than poor decisions.
0751529818|5|'Tuedays with Morrie' was a wonderful read. I laughed and cried with Mitch and Morrie. I have known a young person who died from ALS when she was 45, My mother and I used to visit her on Sundays. Morries' Story is an inspirational one and makes you appreciate the simple things in life.
B000002X2B|3|Blows sounds essentially like an old JA album and a pretty good one at that. It's highly emotive and an obviously sincere and genuine work compared to today's era of disposable nonsense lyrics and non-melodic electronic/machine rhythms. The unfortunate thing is that for such a haughty concept as universal truth and worth the writing, both lyrically and musically, could have been something they put a little more work into. That's not to say I don't like or appreciate the concept because I like it a lot but as a package the lyrics don't flow particularly well and too many of the melodies sound forced (ie. Mau Mau the opening track).     I've always liked JA and Kantner both but this album has some fabulous bright spots and really did deserve some serious reworking and polishing before putting it out.
B0074QGGK6|5|Really inspiring
B00BFUUMO8|5|This game is my favorite game, when you do something it may take a while and bucks cost real money, but if your patient, you'll love it !!!
B00H58VGIA|5|I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys historical fiction. I found it compelling and could not stop reading. Having the perspectives of both Sarah and Handful was fascinating.
B000OZ0NXA|4|I read this after seeing the Jack Reacher movie (Tom Cruise did a good job, but he is definitely an example of stunt casting; in the book series Reacher is a walking mountain). It's a decent thriller with an interesting main character. The author's foreword does a great job of explaining how he approaches the series--I recommend readers on the fence check it out to decide if this book is for them. I'm sure I'll get around to reading more Reacher books at some point in the future.
B006ID6NDQ|5|This book was written from the perspective of a Jewish person during Hitler's time. It took me through the life and times of one woman's struggle to survive the status of being a Jew. Well written and puts the reader in the position of seeing the horror and inhumanity of those times from her eyes. Highly recommend. Proud of her heritage but in order to survive, had to hide it.
B000063DI8|3|I love maiden they really do rock, but this album really does need more variety, unlike most maiden albums these songs sound very samey and tiresome. I love the title track however a great opening guitar riff, and public enema no1 is another great track, plus hooks in you, but that bout it, and janicks solo in bring your daughter.. is cool, but thats about it. A very weak album from an amazing rock band. Not the best, get seventh son of a seventh son or powerslave instead
B00006IUL7|4|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Insomnia\\" Starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It was a police movie, sort of, but the main policeman was Al Pacino, a Los Angeles homicide detective on leave and investigating a murder case in small-town Alaska. The real star of the movie was Alaska. Man, that's a beautiful state and the scenery was excellent! In any case, a young woman was murdered and Pacino was on the perplexing case and was getting nowhere fast. Ultimately, he found a suspect, Robin Williams, and in the chase ended up shooting and killing his own partner. The shooting was not intentional, of course, and he tried to cover it up. Big mistake. The killer suspect had witnessed him doing it and used the info as leverage to keep his own unintentional murder out of the spotlight. Let's just say that the case gets somewhat complicated. Much more complicated than this. Too complicated, in my opinion. It becomes surrealistic. Oh, and the whole matter was further complicated by the high summer season with bright sunlight around the clock and a debilitating case of insomnia suffered by a dreary Pacino. Well, personally, I've been in Fairbanks, Alaska, during the all-day season and I think the movie greatly exaggerated the effects.<br /><br />The acting was quite good by the entire cast, but Pacino stood out. No surprise there. Williams did a good job, but paled next to Pacino, unfortunately. The directing and filming was first rate. I was not overly impressed with quality of the story. I'd rank it as an excellent movie and well worth watching, but it wasn't quite up there with the best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B004WPT3ZM|5|One of my all time favorite thrash metal albums ever!!this is the version for the diehard Mega fans like myself. This version is the original recording only louder and better. Especially the re-recorded versions!!you know,the version that pretty much takes away the pounding snare drum on peace sells(the song)!this is the best version to date!!buy it know and crank it up and piss off your neighbors(if you have any)!!I know I am!!

B00005LMWI|5|Within the realms of metal, there are those who like great vibrato-vocal ridden melodies, blistering soulful Marty Friedman-esque guitar solos, and epic movie-like musical ambience complimenting the metal aggression of the power chord crunch. Kamelot deliver to us in spades, and can now be deemed as one of the best power metal groups in existence today.<br />Karma is an album you get once in a blue moon. From the moment you push play, you do not want to skip a single track, and in fact, it urges you to listen intently for the fear of missing out on some majestic piece of orchestration.<br />The album's opener, &quot;Regalis Apertura&quot;, an instrumental that, in my mind, takes you to some mythical Hyborean age of Conan or Braveheart, adjoins to &quot;Forever&quot; which, believe me, has the most intense melody hook that doesn't want to let go (and has you humming for hours on end). And it doesn't stop there - the entire set of 12 songs (not including &quot;Ne Pleure Pas&quot; since it is basically &quot;Don't you Cry&quot; in French) is a fantastic effort in a genre of music that needed this gulping breath of fresh air.<br />Cutting it very simply, if you can appreciate metal with melody, then this is the creme de la creme. Fans of Iron Maiden (Somewhere in Time/Seventh Son era), Yngwie Malmsteen (Eclipse/Fire&amp;Ice era), Marty Friedman (RIP/Scenes era), and epic movie soundtracks will love Kamelot.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3|I got really frustrated reading this book. It only tries to make a point that the main character was ignorant and simpleminded. It also proposes the case for &#34;pure luck&#34; for the development of Christianity, and not a clear revolution on the way common people started seeing the world. The book does not deserve the praises in top-magazines.
0765325950|5|Been reading this series for close to 20 years.  A bittersweet read!  Full of action and you will not regret the wait.  Sad, because it is the last book.
B00SI7GCJK|5|Nothing to say about. A perfect experience... Would have been better with a 7.1 DTS audio track, but 5.1 it's enough I guess. One thing I noticed it's that my audio receiver renders Mattew's voice really saturated, almost wrong. Not sure if my speakers have problems, but I tried to check with other movies I know and doesn't have that problem. Wierd thing it's just Mattews dialog. Sometimes he is just talking, not even screaming, so it has to be something in his voive tone that makes my spearkers &#34;crash&#34; the sound a little, specificly central speaker.<br />Other than that, perfect!<br />I also got a full IMAX film cell! :).
B0051ANPZQ|5|This was a great book. I would love to see all middle schoolers read this book to gain some understanding of how their behavior and reactions to other's differences affects those people.
B000001E18|5|Remember when in early 1994, Bono strolled onto the Grammy stage and spat out his infamous spill of how U2 was going to keep on f*****g up the mainstream? Well they pretty much nailed it with this album.  <br />The reason being is this: in 1993, grunge was at its height. Electronic and dance music had not been intigrated into the mainstream, even though it had a large following and was growing. <br />So enter U2, the arguably the world's biggest band and right right in the middle of possibly the biggest tour in world history. Instead of giving into what was hot in the moment, that being grunge, they went ahead and released this candy wrapper of a cd with a cosmonaut of a baby on the front. <br />I wish I could have seen the millions of faces that put this cd into their player and heard songs like \\"Numb\\", \\"DGTPFYCC\\" and \\"Lemon\\". <br />Honestly, I don't think the mainstream world was ready for what was hitting them at that moment. Not that U2 had invented this type of music and these sounds, but they what did was brought it into the living rooms of the mainstream listening world. <br />I honestly believe that this opened up the whole market for dance and electronic music. Yes, it might be a stretch to say that, but bands like NIN that had a massive underground before this in 1994 saw their success explode with \\"The Downward Spiral\\".  From the mid 90's on, there was a massive opening for this type of music also. Combine this with \\"Passangers\\", I think U2 opened alot of doors for many bands like Radiohead.  <br />While this album does have some weak points, one has to take into account that it was written and recorded during the middle of the tour!  <br />
B001M0HGR2|5|It was great to see the movie that started the Avengers franchise off so well!  It set the tone for what has followed.

B00GT83J50|5|I get both Goodfellas and the Untouchables with this set!  Is there a way I could rate this 2 movie set more than 5 stars?  Since Amazon only goes up to 5 stars I'll have to settle for only 5 stars.  These two movies are classics that are not only great crime thillers but great movies under any genre.  Goodfellas and the Untouchables both feature the amazing acting of Robert Deniro.<br /><br />Goodfellas is a 1990 American crime film directed by Martin Scorsese.  It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese.  The film follows the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family through the eyes of a Lucchese associate, Henry Hill.  The movie covers the period of time from 1955 to 1980.  The movie features the great acting of Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco, and Paul Sorvino.  Goodfellas was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Supporting Actor (Joe Pesci, who won).<br /><br />The Untouchables is a 1987 American crime drama directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet.  The film is based on the book The Untouchables.  This film stars Kevin Costner as government agent Eliot Ness who is attempting to take down Al Capone.  The movie also features Robert De Niro, Sean Connery, and Andy Garc&iacute;a.  Untouchables was nominated for the Academy Award in the following categories: Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Sean Connery, Won), Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Score.<br /><br />I enjoyed both these movies a great deal and would definitely recommend this set.
B0027MJU00|2|I read this book after Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  I did not like this book. I  was very, very disappointed.
B0000AZJXQ|5|A Perfect Circle delivers the good, as expected, once again. While there style of music may not cater to those who are programmed to generic Rock music, it truly stands out by taking Rock to a higher level. Best alt. Rock album, period.
159315724X|5|Amazing book with great resources that really make you say, &#34;WOW!&#34;
B00DJFIMW6|5|Fun time killer that doesn't cost anything unless you're a dork lol. I havent psent any money and it is still fun
B00006ADD5|2|Its suprising that this movie is from 1962. It feels like a movie made in the 40's or 50's. It has that overblown theatrical feel. Kind of like Wizard of Oz. There are some redeeming qualities of this film. The filming and camera angles are excellent. Some of the acting is good, but not great. Its almost like a Monty Python movie except it isn't funny and it's too \\"old-style\\". Other than that, Lawrence of Arabia would have made a great parody Monty Python movie if they would have went for that. They should have because there is no historical accuracy, no middle eastern actors, nothing real whatsoever. But thats would people liked back then, fake b.s.<br />This movie is similar to the movie \\"Giant\\". Its way too long and it has good actors but the performances are weak. \\"Giant\\" was absolutely horrible though, and this movie is not horrible, just boring, dumb, thoughtless, it also reminds me of Hogan's Heroes, where all the army people talk like they got a gerbal in their throat, or maybe in their pants I don't know. There is one scene where a British officer touches Peter O'Tooles nipple and starts fondling his breast. Peter O'toole hits the officer and then gets whipped while the perverted officer watches and starts coughing, is that like a hernia test innuendo or something? Whats up with the coughing?<br />There is another scene where Peter O'Toole gets shot with a gun and the gunshot has enough force to knock him off the top of a train car, but then gets up with only a little bloodspot on his shoulder. Is this \\"Night of the Zombies\\", or is this supposed to be somewhat historical? They can't make their minds up whether this movie was supposed to be a big joke, or whether they wanted to go somewhere with this. Regardless, there is some beautiful scenery of a bunch of white american actors trying to look Arabic riding camels through the desert. They either talk British or American of course. This would have made a great black comedy if they would have had to eat Peter O'Toole at the end because they got hungry. Oh well, waste 4 hours and watch this junk.le at the end because they got hungry. Oh well, waste 4 hours and watch this junk.
B0015346OM|5|Was a very good book. Enjoyed reading it on my kindle. Nothing like what the movie shows. Very shocked to read some of the book and go back to the movie and see the difference.
B004OR199G|5|Reading \\"Crazy Sexy Diet\\" made me reminisce about my old 5th grade days as the book is set up much like a social studies textbook, complete with short chapters, captioned pictures, and even a main points summary at the end of each chapter.  While I used to dread reading those old social studies text books, I was excited to read this book as the Carr assembled a fresh, modern, helpful, easy- and fun-to-read user guide about how to align one's body, mind, and spirit.<br /><br />I particularly loved the colorful pictures.  I could imagine that even the strongest veggie hater might view the vibrant, vivid, fresh vegetables that were depicted and be somehow magically allured into trying them--perhaps even just one bite!  The images made the veggies look so fresh that I felt like they would pop right off the page for instant consumption.<br /><br />Other reviewers noted concerns about the \\"colorful\\" language (aka curse words) in the book.  While these words popped up here and there, it didn't bother me as it allowed me to feel more personally connected with the author as she let her full personality shine through and used an authentic, believable, everyday young woman kind of voice throughout the book.  While it didn't offend me, I can understand how the language might offend some so if you are bothered by the notion of seeing a swear word here and there you might want to try another book.<br /><br />In \\"Crazy Sexy Diet,\\" Carr gives advice on a range of holistic health topics from juicing, to meditating, to pooping (and everything in between)!  The information is health and nutrition 101, so this book would be great for someone new to the subject matter or for those who want general explanations about why certain health/well-being recommendations are commonly made.<br /><br />Reading Carr's book was like getting a gentle nudge from a girlfriend to take better care of myself.  I appreciate that she gave a gentle push without throwing me over the edge.  She encourages readers to take one healthy step at a time.<br /><br />An \\"A+\\" for this adult-version health and wellness textbook.  Note: I would have given extra credit if she had included more recipes.  Perhaps I'll just have to check out her newest book for that.
0525478817|5|The Fault in Our Stars is not a \\"cancer\\" book. Yes, it features 16 year olds with cancer, but that is not what this book is essentially about. The topic of cancer is important in the sense that it was used to drive the story and its characters, and if anything, it only got us - as readers - more easily attached to them. It shaped the characters into who they are and what they become and it made us, the readers, more emotionally invested in them. You know what's going to happen from the very first page, but it is no less heartbreaking when it does.<br /><br />Hazel is a 16 year old who loves reading, trashy TV, her family and ultimately Augustus. Hazel has terminal thyroid cancer which has taken over her lungs to the point where an oxygen tank becomes a permanent accessory. During one of the weekly cancer support groups, she meets Augustus - a 16 year old who has lost his leg in a battle with a malignant leg tumor. Together, these two characters had the most incredible blend of sarcastic wit and literary conversations that there was absolutely no getting away from it - I fell in love.<br /><br />I knew I was going to have a major book crush on Augustus when he immediately, upon being introduced to Hazel, told her she was beautiful and looked like Nathalie Portman from V for Vendetta. That crush got bigger when he complained about the wrong use of the word \\"literally\\".<br /><br />Death is a theme in this book, losing people you know or love, dealing with it then moving on. It makes you think about the courage it takes to move on after a parent loses his or her child, about the life you've spent, about how much you have left of it, about the value of living it to the fullest.<br /><br />The characters were so real, as John Green usually makes them, that I had to put the book down several times and just breathe and remind myself that they weren't. And even though they might not be real, the situation definitely is. This book made me laugh, it made me think, and it made me cry in huge heaving sobs of despair and heartbreak. I knew what was going to happen, but it still shocked me to no end. It all felt so unfair, so unreal...I almost wanted to write Green an email ranting to him about his choice of plot twist.<br /><br />When I finished the book - very late at night - I \\"literally\\" curled up in bed and sobbed into my pillow. I could relate to the heartbreak, because I have personally been through it.<br /><br />Thank you John Green for being such a great writer. Thank you for giving us such great material to read and reminding us of the value of life in every book you write. I cannot recommend this book enough to people - and no, not only Young Adults fans.<br /><br />I'm ending this with something a reviewer said that I could not agree with more, \\"thank you, John Green, for ruining the next few books I read.\\"me cry in huge heaving sobs of despair and heartbreak.

B005OYKHSM|5|Love this movie! Paul Walker we miss you!! R.I.P.
B008VBYN80|2|Pros:<br />1.  The graphics are beautiful.<br />2.  Great zoom feature.<br />3.  Quests help guide you and explain the game.<br />4.  Lisa (quest helper) has some humor.<br />5.  Cute soundtrack.<br />6.  Gameloft puts in live events that last for a limited amount of time. For example: pirates battles, player tournaments, and seasonal decorations. Game can be played (very very very sloooooowly) for free.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  The game forces you to \\"friend\\" other's kingdoms through Gameloft Live or Facebook (There are quests that specifically require this.) Unfortunately the log in is buggy and does not work much of the time. Most of the time you cannot visit friend's kingdoms due to a bug. Logging in to the player tournaments is often an exercise in frustration for the same reason.<br />2.  To play it as a game at even a slow pace, you MUST buy diamonds. LOTS of diamonds. They quickly become expensive. $4.99 for 40 Diamonds at the Gameloft Store.<br />3.  Diamonds are required to purchase better units for combat. But if a diamond bought unit dies in combat, you get one chance immediately after the battle to buy it back for 1/2 to 3/4ths the cost in diamonds of the original cost, or lose it forever. For example:  28 Diamond Master Archer dies, to get him back costs 23 Diamonds.<br />4.  Energy is required to harvest, build buildings, chop down trees, collect taxes and stage attacks on enemies. However it regens very slowly, one every 2 and a half minutes or so. And energy is capped based on level.  So you can only have up to a certain amount. Once you use it all, and you will in about a minute, you must wait or buy more.  Diamonds are required to purchase more \\"energy\\": 5 Energy for 5 Diamonds. Again, crazy expensive to keep buying energy so that you can actually make the game play at a decent pace.<br />5.  Many quests require you to build structures bought with diamonds: Small Tent for 14 Diamonds, Belvedere for 20 Diamonds, Advanced Training Academy 60 Diamonds, etc. Just to build the structures for these three quests will cost you over $10.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />It makes me sad because I really wanted to like this game. The graphics are beautiful. There is a storyline.  But the game is just too expensive and slow. It would cost an easy $100 and up to truly make this game move at a reasonable pace and to make it enjoyable.  I recommend Kairosoft's Dungeon Village, Kairobotica and Beastie Bay instead. $4.99 per game and done =D
B0008ENHUI|5|Everyone has a favorite movie for their own reasons. This well shot, intense flick is my favorite for it's grit, pain, passion,suspence and excellent acting. You could put your-self in Papillon's shoes; it's that close to each of are own realities. This is a must have and you'll want to share it with your friends. Excellent movie!
B0029NY9YO|5|SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />I just loved this movie. Bear in mind that I usually do not like movies like Transformers, 2012, the Michael Bay ones, Con Air, Mission Impossible (the second part is the worst of all) stuff like that. Also, I also go for comic adaptations with suspicious. But, after \\"IRON MAN\\", I thought they could really work.<br /><br />I was  in the middle of part five of the graphic novel (yes, that's a sin, never read it before), when I watched the movie. I don't know if it was the good mood I was in the day, whatever, but the movie got me by the opening sequence and I never got bored or disappointed. I just loved it, every single bit of it (and, like it semms to be the case with many fans, Roscharch was my favorite character.<br /><br />First, up until I had read the novel, I thought it was a faithful adaptation. Second, the cinematography was spectacular. Casting and costume design were on the spot, it was like the comics were alive. And, thankfuly, the editing was great. You could see the fights, see what's happening, instead of these modern lightning-cut editing tha people seem to enjoy today.<br /><br />The adpaptation was clearly handled with care and affection by people involved; However, I can understand some negative points mentioned by some reviewers. We must remember director Snyder was behind cameras in DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 (which I did not like at all). So, he clearly enjoys some gore. But, overall, given the lenght of the movie and the potential scenes to use graphical gore, he kept his instincts at bay... He only goes for it with full throttle in the scene when Roscharch kills the raper. Also, thre is Dr. Manhattan pulverizing Vietnamese people, The Comedian killing a pregnant woman,the overall annihilation of a number of cities around the world. But these last ones are done without so much graphic description. And, remember: the scenes (or at least the idea) ARE in the comics!<br /><br />Like I said, I loved this movie.
B00HY7VU60|5|Very good
B00I8Q77Y0|4|I love it because it's like flappy bird but I can't find it on the app store. So it fills in the gap
B00E8KLWB4|4|If a great way to kill time. The challenges aren't that difficult, but if you're of the vision impaired variety, you'll definitely need your glasses to find some of the objects. All in all, I've enjoyed playing this game.
0385486804|5|I choose the book INTO THE WILD from a list of books that was given to me by my professor.  The reason that I choose this book is because I really enjoyed the summery right away it allowed me to get a little taste of the  book which made me want to read the book.  The book his full of a lot of  action, suspense, stupidity, intelligence, and a big heart by the main  charcter Chris McCandless.  It takes you through the ups and downs of his  journey and leaves you wondering why.  This is a really good book it's  based on a true story and I really recommend it to all students and adults  if you are interested in non-fiction. (National Bestseller)
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I have not read a bad book written by this man; some less interesting, not as satisfying as others, but all well-written.<br /><br />Great story; nice to get back to Clanton and Jake Brigance! No sequence to A Time To Kill, but another great story in that setting.
B0070Y46UY|2|Actually bought this book by mistake - and it really was a mistake.  I kept it because others seemed to enjoy it, but I thought it was boring - a real waste of $8.
B00BTYP6QE|4|Good fun, not too hard that it hurts my head.
B002UZCJ8Y|1|Worst Bruce Willis movie that I've ever seen.  Very dissapointing.  I do not recommend spending money on this movie. .
B002XHN776|5|Get over the \\"sound\\" of the album; it is not techno.   I'm tired of the \\"it sounds like U2 or Kings of Leon\\" reviews.  This is the equivalent of saying all 70's or 80's music sounds alike.  No, it's the \\"new sound\\" the sound of the decade.    The fan chants. This is the most brilliant idea ever.  Just imagine the response at concerts. All the fans knowing exactly what to sing and when. \\"The Summits\\" where a true testament to how passionate this band is about their fans. I don't find this annoying at all. Most chants take place as an intro, exit or some chorus we would butcher trying sing along to anyhow.    Favorite tracks of mine, Night of the hunter, Closer to the Edge    The \\"From Yesterday\\" video \\"The Wish\\", asks for \\"the sound of tomorrow\\" this is it, This is War!
B00AH69BPM|3|To continue my point: if you didn't enjoy Death Magnetic or don't feel a desire to collect all Metallica track releases, then you really don't need this.  The songs are just more of the same.
B00ARF93AQ|3|Action, action, and action!!!!!!
0671799320|5|An extremely comprehensive and educational book covering  a topic that everyone, worldwide, should be familiar with, especially given current events in the Middle East.<br />I loved this book.<br />Basically, this book covers the entire history of the oil industry!  The story begins with  the engineers who found the undistilled rock oils in places like Pennsylvania and ends in 1992 after the Gulf War had ended.  It documents how the industry evolved during that time period, how events such as the introduction of the automobile changed it, and how eventually it came to figure largely in world politics.  The many people whose lives were intimately intertwined in oil are all mentioned: the engineers, the oil company execs, the sheiks, the kings, the presidents and the prime ministers.<br />Fascinating story.<br />I want to see the movie (PBS documentary)!
193799418X|5|Beautiful boxed set
B000A0GYD2|5|I just finished watching this series last night.  It is, in my opinion, the finest thing (series, mini-series, or tv movie) ever produced for television.  It was stunning.    The best part involves the writing and the decisions made regarding the focus of each episode.  While some of them were obvious (e.g. the episode that focuses on Apollo 11), there were others that were brilliant, such as the episode focusing on the development of the Lunar Module (\\"Spider\\"), the episode on how astronauts were trained as scientists (\\"Gallileo was right\\") and the episode on the wives of the \\"New Nine\\" astronauts (\\"The Original Wives Club\\").    Truly a tremendous accomplishment.    I purchased the \\"Signature Edition.\\"  Not having seen the others, I cannot comment regarding which is better, but this one certainly looked and sounded great on a large wide screen.
B0070NSPCU|5|A wonderful gritty fantasy. What I love about this particular story is that the hero is competent, stoic and thoughtful while lacking any whiny qualities that some fantasies seem to foist on the lead character - a welcome change. There are reviews here with fairly comprehensive synopsis should you need one - all I can say is that this is a very worthy purchase.<br /><br />Sadly, as I understand it, we'll have to wait till 2013 before we get to see the next book due to the author (deservedly) signing a proper book deal.
B00701L5XS|1|It was good info but you have to pay for it!!! REALLY!!! You can find it ok the Internet get smart people remember most things like this is on the Internet. I am not putting anyone down its normal people forget the internet but DON'T BY THIS APP!!!

B00001OH7U|5|What can one say about this album, other than that there are no bad tracks on it? Every song is close to perfect. The only critique I can give is that there are only six tracks, wich are so good they leave you hungry for more. Even with six tracks the album's running time is long enough to make it an excellent buy. And besides, who'd want to miss out on these songs?!
0743424425|5|which is better the shining or salem's lot?  they are my 2 fav books i read salem's lot and thought nothing could be better, then i read the shining.thank you mr king for writing these great novels
B00IUBM8PQ|5|The government pushes the people toward revolution.  It's what people do when they have nothing else to lose.  They can either cower in fear or attempt to throw off an oppressive government.  Looking fforward to the next episode, the Mockingjay.
B003ZSJ212|5|My review hopefully will be helpful for all the parents out there.  I have four kids ranging in ages from 3-9.  Below is the reaction of each of my kids for each episode.  I will update this review as they watch each movie.  We started with Episode IV just like i did when i was a kid.  I hope this review will help you if you are trying to decide if your child will be interested based on their age.<br /><br />Episode IV : A New Hope<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Fell Asleep after 30 minutes.  She seemed interested in it, but at that age it seems like 30 minutes is the max attention you can get.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the entire thing.  At some moments he seemed to get a little scared but it would only last about 2 seconds and he was fine.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Watched the whole thing and had questions the whole time.  Seemed to be very interested in the characters more than the battle and plot.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : The most interested of all the kids.  Didn't say anything the whole time.  After the movie was finished wanted to start Episode V<br /><br />Overall as a dad there was only a few parts i felt like maybe the kids should not see. My kids mostly watch the disney channel so this really was there first PG movie that they have seen.  The part where obi wan kenobi gets killed was a part that i looked over at the kids to see their reaction.  They all seemed fine.<br /><br />Episode V : The Empire Strikes Back<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 10 minutes and then was off to go play with her toys.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Only lasted about 1 hour and asked me if we could start it over another day.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Stopped watching after about 1 hour also, and said she was not into all the 'spaceship battles'.  She really liked the character portions of the movie and not so much the ship scenes.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Once again was the most interested of all the kids.  Nevergot up once to leave, and didn't say anything during the movie.<br /><br />Overall this one was the least interesting for the kids between episode IV and V.  My oldest said that she liked the movie but liked episode IV better.  This had a few scenes that made me cringe for the kids.  When the Wampa caught Luke and held him in the cave.  The Wampa is sitting in the cave eating the Tauntaun.  Also, after Luke frees himself, he slices off the Wampa's arm.  Also, when Han rescues Luke in the snow, he slices open the Tauntaun's belly to place Luke inside.  All of these parts where a little uncomfortable for me as a dad with young kids.  Add in the part where Luke loses his arm to Vader and this movie between the two was a little worse in that way.<br /><br />Episode VI : Return of the Jedi<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Only lasted about 30 before she fell asleep.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and was extremely interested.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the ewoks.  She was really into this movie.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Understood the relationship between the different characters.  Really like the ewoks as well.  Seemed to be sad about Darth Vader's end.<br /><br />The kids loved this one.  The ewoks really captured the kids attention.  I think this movie helped peek their interest for the other three movies to come.<br /><br />Episode 1 : The Phantom Menace<br />1 (Gender - Girl Age - 3) : Was in and out of the room during the whole movie, but seemed to be more interested in this movie than any of the other three.<br />2 (Gender - Boy Age - 5) : Watched the whole thing and actually understood that Anakin was Darth Vader when he was younger.<br />3 (Gender - Girl Age - 7) : Loved the movie, especially the queen and when she revealed her true self before the battle it seemed to be a real nice surprise for her.<br />4 (Gender - Girl Age - 9) : Loved this movie as well.  The relationship between Anakin and The Queen really seemed to be of interest for both of my older girls.  Whereas my son seemed more interested in the battle scenes.<br /><br />I know the die-hard Star Wars people out there hate jar jar binks, but all four of my kids loved him.  They actually had a lego character of him and never new who he was.  Now after seeing him in the movie they were super excited to know who he was.  They laughed at him every time he did something dumb and kind of made the movie for them.  Of course the girls loved the queen also.  All the kids constantly want to know who is good and who is bad.  Part of me wants to tell them right away but I kept it secret like when I was younger.  They quickly seemed to understand who was good and who was bad.<br /><br />Episode 2 : Attack of the Clones<br />*will review once we have watched it together.
B00J6YA1V4|5|Great read
0061148512|1|For most of my adult life (I am 49) people who get to know me tell me that I would absolutely love this book.  I finally got round to reading it recently.  What a disappointment.  What is it all about?  She repeats herself several times and I don't understand what it means at all.  Shame.
1433502410|5|Many of the other folks have done a more detailed review than i am able to do,however,I just want to share the excitement I have in reading the Bible again,The contributors that put this together did such a wonderful job!I understand there is a reformed bias and the other reviewers explained this well,but,there is a loving care that is evident is this study Bible,and this goes beyond thier personal beliefs about secondary issues and just brings back that unselfish God centered joy in His truth that sometimes gets lost when someone tries too hard to explain thier take on things,This is a study bible for the ages.I purchased the hardcover edition which fit my budget and I love it,It's also a very heavy Bible which I enjoy also,I dont know why perhaps it's more to love! Take a look at it and prayerfully consider it even if you you have never considered the ESV,Though I am still a KJV guy at heart,This one may win your affections again as It has me,and if you've lost that \\"first love\\" a little, this may help you see Jesus with that simple devotion again-enjoy!    Update:Dec.30,2008 Still loving this Bible and am recommending it to anyone who will listen,however I do have a problem that I emailed Crossway about this evening,The black paper that is glued to my Hardcover edition is separating from the spine of the book and I can see the mesh inside the binding,perhaps this is just a defect in my copy and I'm sure Crossway will help me replace this defective copy,but i cant see going with the Hardcover again after this experience,and I will update this again as this becomes resolved,lastly I still must say this Study Bible is exciting and in my opinion the finest ever made I cant recommend it highly enough although i would suggest avoiding the Hardcover edition
B002PEP4SC|5|I love Castle, the TV show and have watched and watched many re-runs...this book keeps up the fiction of the TV character's writing a novel about the TV character he shadows (Beckett)...&#34;Heat Wave&#34; is referred to in the show...interaction of the characters was different, in accord with the difference that the TV Castle sets up...it's a fun dash...I don't know if I would have liked it as much if I didn't know how it was connected to the show...but, hey, spend a couple bucks (Kindle it) and have a good time...
B00PRXDUE8|4|Great acting but story is intense.
B002ZG98LO|5|Predators  is the best summer movie so far and one of the best of the year. I'll be honest I've only seen three summer movies. There was Iron Man 2, The A Team and now Predators. It's just been a really Summer for movies. You can just tell by the previews that they aren't going to be remotely good. Now out of the three Predators is the best movie.    Predators harkens back to the first Predators movie. Breaking from the recent horrible Alien Vs Predator movies. The movie has the same feel as the first movie. It also has the same kind of set up a group off harden killers try to survive against a group of Predators. I had some lingering doubts that this movie would be good but I was wrong, it was great. It had a great premise. Instead of hunting on Earth the Predators take humans to another planet. A planet wide game preserve where the Predators hone their skills.    The characters introductions won't surprise to many people. The loner but reluctant leader. The man with a family. The silent warrior. It goes on from there. There is one character you won't be able to read, because he just doesn't belong with the group which was a nice twist. The actors from Adrien Brody and Topher Grace  to Alice Braga and Danny Trejo all did really good jobs with their characters. The only person I had a problem with and the only real problem I had with the movie was Noland (Laurence Fishburne). What was the point of his character except to movie the plot along and they really didn't need him for that. And I like the actor too. He almost always plays interesting characters. It's just in this movie he was pointless.    The action and special effects were truly well done. There were many great scenes. But my favorite had to be the scene between Hanzo (Louis Ozawa Changchien) and one of the predators. I won't give anything away but it was one of the best if not the best scenes of the movie.    The ending of the movie was open ended which I really liked. There's so many directions they cantake this franchise as long as they don't go back to the Alien Vs Predator type of movie I think I'll be happy. Overall this is a excellent movie. Out of the three Predator movies (I just chose to believe the AVP movies never existed) I would have to say this is the second best movie. It was ha hard choice between the first one and this one but I just love the Arnold and the cast of the first movie more. In fact all the Predator movies were great it's just that the first one was the best.    Predator 5/5    Predators 5/5    Predators 2 4.5/5
0062409859|4|Not what I expected from Harper Lee. To Kill A Mockingbird is my favorite book. The writing was rough in this book. Definitely wasn't edited.
B00AREIAI8|5|needs a little more activity's like instead of a blue bar to jump actually have the like slide up like temple run
1400034779|4|This book is reminiscent to me of Tony Hillerman's books, in that we are taken into the lives of a different type of people with their own way of dealing with a different kind of lifestyle that we are not familiar with, only instead of the four-corner area of the southwest, we are in Botswana, Africa.  The story is not one of a thriller packed with action, but of a No.1 lady detective (the only one) who is approached by various customers to look into mundane to serious cases in her area.  It is a relaxing, funny, sad and thought provoking book.  It gives the reader a look at life in Botswana that is entertaing and informative and leaves you wanting to learn more.  There aren't many fiction books on life in Africa that is available to the average citizen  that is this enjoyable.  You have a relaxed, good feeling when you finish the book.
B000002UAO|5|For me, reviewing ANY album by the Beatles is a bit intimidating.  But I will toss in my $.02 and declare that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a tremendous album that signaled an important transition for the Beatles, who, by the end of 1965, flexed their songwriting muscles even harder.  A winning mix of folkish pop with some country twang, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; has some qualified winners: listen to the sitar in the trippy but marvelous folk ditty &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;; the bluesy rock of &quot;Drive My Car&quot;; and the introspective, self-reflecting lyrics in &quot;In My Life,&quot; one of Lennon's strongest compositions.  But my personal favorite is the often overlooked album cut &quot;Wait,&quot; which features lead vocals from both Lennon and McCartney.  Following this album, they would move on to bigger things including the 1966 followup &quot;Revolver.&quot;  I don't profess to be a diehard Beatles guru, but &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is a must-have for anyone looking to start a collection of their work.
B00005OM5L|5|Blues lovers, don't miss this!<BR> <BR>14 classics from blues maestro played good and rough, his solos are lengthy and inventive and the supporting band is just amazing (though it won't be amazing anymore when you look at the names of the musicians). Except &quot;Layla&quot; (the first track where the soundman was sleeping and we could not hear J. Portnoy's harmonica and whole horn section), all tracks sound powerful. The picture quality is rather good (not excellent, but considering the age of the record (the gig was in 1996), it is OK), and the sound is recorded in stereo, 5.1 Dolby surround and 5.1 DTS.<BR> <BR>Great concert and simply a must-have for all music lovers!<BR> <BR>Well, EC definitely was wonderful that night!

B00005S6K8|4|Let's simply step away from this continuous obsession with the original &quot;Sabrina.&quot;  These are two different films--black and white versus color, Bogart versus Ford, then versus now.  They share a plot form, but we the audience truly need not compare the two--better to enjoy them as two distinct films, each offering its own blessing.<br />Having said that, I confess that I enjoyed in this modern Sabrina what others have criticized, namely its ambiguity.  We don't always see into our characters' minds so that every move is telegraphed.  Instead, we retain some sense of mystery and uncertainty, which both produce lasting interest in the characters.  Vulnerability is heightened, a neat and tidy ending is averted.  This makes the film richer and more durable.<br />Pollack also achieves a fine look for his film, and a leisurely pace for unfolding the story.  Enjoy &quot;Sabrina,&quot; a true original.
0887431461|5|This book was very good for my child to do during the summer before kindergarten. There are several sections that focus on different topics such as letters, numbers, drawing, coloring, counting, simple math, coins, shapes, colors and so much more.
B00JJXTP64|5|Each book in this series only gets better, and Archangel's Shadows doesn't disappoint. Ash and Janvier's interactions have been a favorite of mine, and the story is fantastic... Along with dropping a few nuggets about other key characters. I wonder if Aodhan Illium and Nasir's stories are on the horizon.
0545265355|5|First of all, I am a 41 year-old mother of four.  Though The Hunger Games trilogy is geared toward young adults, I enjoyed this series tremendously.  Both of my oldest sons read these books and they enjoyed them, as well. Because my sons are teens who enjoy warfare-type video games, I was curious as to how they would respond to this trilogy.  This series does not glorify violence; as a matter of fact, it challenges the reader to evaluate the rationale behind war and violence.  Katniss, the heroine of the series, is well-written and realized.  I often found myself wondering if the author had interviewed people who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as she captured the difficulties faced by those who have it.  I also thought that the arc of the story was realistic and unpredictable, even though the 'games' are a recurring plot device throughout all three novels (the third novel has a wider arena).    The author creates a wonderful landscape, using descriptive--but not poetic--language. It is a very visual book, and very action-packed.  That being said, her prose is elegant in that she does not go into too much detail, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks.  Mockingjay was a bit harder to read for me, as Peeta is not present in a great deal of the book.  Peeta, the male protagonist of the stories, is symbolic of hope.  Because 'hope' wasn't present for so much of this book, it was a much more bleak story than the previous two.  The greatest tribute to these books that I can offer is that after having read the series, they provided a great deal of conversation between my sons and I. It was so nice to discuss the themes and characters, as well as the emotions that the stories invoked in each of us.  I think that these books were a nice counterpoint to so much of the violent media offered to the young people of today.  My sons were able to reflect upon the psychological toll that violence has on the mind and heart.  I found myself thinking of Katniss,Peeta, and the other characters long after I'd finished the books.
B00DPM90C4|5|Fast paced. Well written thriller. A believable and very possible plot. I will think twice before getting another flu shot.
B004SJ3BCI|1|I see nothing wrong with this game but I busy don't think it's fun. Shoot a pig with a bird. That's alp you do.
0385534639|5|in other words, WOW.  It's almost two in the morning. I just finished the book. And I can't wait to talk about it!  I like period pieces about circuses (Gary Jennings' _Spangle_ is one of the best books I have ever read in my life). The blurb said something about \\"binding\\" and \\"magic\\" and \\"love\\" so I knew it would be something a bit more.  It was. I often had to reread earlier chapters to really understand what was going on in the part I was reading then. To me, that is the sign of a good book, where nuggets that may become really important later are dropped in places that don't make sense then, but eventually are crucial two hundred pages later.  Other reviewers have mentioned the descriptions of the tents, etc.  The book comes together towards two-thirds of the way in (much better than this review) and the amazement can start.  In other words, you will love how the characters interact, you will love the descriptions of the tents, trains, gowns, and such, and you will love the discussions about Important Stuff.  Even more amazing is that this is Miss Morgenstern's first published book. So hopefully we can look forward to more (and better!) stories like this!  Stop reading this and start reading The Night Circus.
B0000A02TZ|5|This is an all time classic and makes me laugh every time I watch it.
B002PEP4SC|3|I enjoyed the book but I prefer watching the show. You could visualize each character as you read. All in all, a good read.
140004281X|5|I have been learning to knit lately, and I'm still at the stage where each stitch is awkward and laborious. Watching my friend and teacher do it is quite different --- smooth and rhythmic, neither too much tension nor too little. I see that knitting is a mysterious architecture of wool and soul in which every loop and turn depends on every other, and with a single missed link the whole web can collapse. <br /> <br />Reading the Canadian writer Alice Munro is similar to this. Her stories are woven with such craft that it seems almost as if she is describing something that really happened rather than inventing it. And the consequences of a lucky encounter or a fateful decision are still playing out years later. <br /> <br />I must admit that I was intimidated by the prospect of reviewing Munro's latest collection, RUNAWAY, named one of the 10 Best Books of 2004 by the New York Times. She is probably my favorite living writer, and so unpretentious about what she does that the last thing I want is to describe her fiction in words fancier or more self-conscious (in one review, I found adumbrate, transformative, sustenance, and salvation) than the language she uses herself. <br /> <br />I'm not alone in feeling perplexed. Jonathan Franzen, writing in the New York Times Book Review (November 14, 2004), was so reluctant to do an ordinary review of this extraordinary writer that instead he produced a (brilliant) list of \\"guesses at why [Munro's] excellence so dismayingly exceeds her fame.\\" And it's true: She is revered rather than celebrated --- no Pulitzer, no Nobel, not even a National Book Award (though she has won plenty of other prizes). Possibly (Franzen mentions this) it has to do with literary form: Short stories (Munro has written only one novel) have not been --- since the days of Chekhov (with whom she is regularly compared) and Saki, Katherine Mansfield and O'Henry --- as valued as much as novels. They're just not considered Big-Deal Lit. <br /> <br />But I am procrastinating. Without giving away the often devastating twists and surprises of the plots of these eight stories (if literary fiction isn't supposed to be suspenseful, somebody forgot to tell Munro), this is what I'd say to somebody who has never read her (if you have, you probably already have your own copy of RUNAWAY). <br /> <br />The first thing is the characters: I wouldn't say they are memorable in the sense that Emma Bovary or Anna Karenina are, but unlike either of those fictional ladies, they are endearingly ordinary: They don't swan around being melodramatic or heroic or incurably romantic. They are often smart, ardent girls, different from others at school, hungry for books and adventure and mystery --- like Grace in \\"Passion,\\" one of my favorites in the collection. Here, Munro has crystallized the stuff of many a coming-of-age novel --- the innocence and fakery, the fear and the splendor --- into one powerful memory of a seductive family and a reckless ride. This is Munro's gift: She gathers us in with ordinary details, and a whole world opens up. <br /> <br />The second thing is the place: not just Canada, but a patch of western Ontario. Munro roots almost all her stories in this area a few hours from Toronto, where she grew up and now lives. \\"I am intoxicated by this particular landscape,\\" she has said, and she seeds it with city people transplanted to the country (like Carla and her husband with their horse farm in the title story, \\"Runaway\\") or country people learning urban ways. There is always a tension between these two, and between other recurrent oppositions as well --- marriage and solitude, survival and suicide, faith and apostasy. Duality runs through her work like a bright thread. <br /> <br />The third thing that is so compelling about RUNAWAY is a powerful sense of fate, chance, destiny --- the exact word is unimportant. Frequently the structure of the stories works in a circle; you can't understand the beginning of \\"Trespasses\\" until youhave read the end. Or, as in the case of the trio of interlinked stories about a woman named Juliet, you don't understand the implications of an accidental meeting in \\"Chance\\" and a fairly uneventful visit to aging parents in \\"Soon\\" until you read the third story, \\"Silence.\\" These tales aren't just chronologically and thematically connected; what Munro does is more like planting time bombs in the narrative that will explode later on, when you least expect them. <br /> <br />This quality is even stronger in \\"Tricks.\\" Robin, a nurse who lives near Stratford, Ontario, goes to see a Shakespeare play (until then, her only passion) and encounters --- yes, by accident --- Danilo, a man from Montenegro. They agree that they will meet again a year later. What happens then is a life --- and we follow Robin until she is in her sixties --- that has the arc and heartbreak and curious detachment of genuine tragedy. \\"Tricks\\" is so bold, so horrifying and at the same time so satisfying that I lived with it for days afterward. <br /> <br />Even though these stories are often piercingly sad, they aren't depressing. There is a wonderful strength and survivorship in the girls and women of RUNAWAY. In \\"Chance\\" Munro writes of Juliet's love of Greek (her degree is in Classics) as her \\"bright treasure\\"; in \\"Tricks,\\" similarly, of Robin's anticipation of her next meeting with Danilo: \\"She was aware of a shine on herself, on her body, on her voice and all her doings.\\" And in \\"Passion\\" Grace is told by her fianc's mother, \\"Women always have got something, haven't they, to keep them going? That men haven't got.\\" <br /> <br />RUNAWAY feels intimate and universal at the same time --- as if the author is whispering in your ear and seeing into your heart and laying bare your secrets. Perhaps that's because Munro herself has spoken of the extreme vulnerability of the \\"thinly clothed\\" writer who has only \\"the thing you're working on now.\\" Her stories dig under the fences of writer and reader, andit is both disturbing and glorious. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman
B007ZGBZHE|5|I can always count on Preston and Child to deliver a superbly written engaging story. Couldn't put the book down! Once you start reading a novel of this calibre you can't put it down. Looking forward, as always, to the next book in this series.
B001FB4W0W|5|What do you do when the kids are away, and you actually have a weekend with your spouse to actually veg out for the first time in forever? Ya grab a season box like this one, make a pile of pocorn and snacks, and drop in your surround sound DVD player! I don't care for the homosexual aspect of the series, but the rest of it was pretty entertaining. Good for a weekend goof.

1455820997|3|There are definitely a few nuggets of wisdom here but like Seth Godin always seems to say, &#34;There is no map.&#34; Personally, I struggle with &#34;getting started&#34; and Pressfield addresses that but no audiobook is going to grab you by the throat and set you straight if your life is busy, complicated or just plain broken. YOU still have to do the work. This book about 20% good stuff and the rest is listening to Pressfield's delivery, which is actually great but also filled with self-referential anecdotes, stories and (like Godin) references to other masters of accomplishments to prove it can be done, whatever it is. My suggestion; don't pay more than $10, listen to it a few times or a dozen, take out a notebook and write an outline describing the insights you personally find most helpful. This will take one sheet (right, Steven?) and then you'll have your bones, all the inspiration you need, and you can resell the book on ebay or donate it to Goodwill or your local library. That's what I did.

B00003CXTG|1|Have you ever wanted to commit suicide but could never come up with the courage?  Watch 'Pearl Harbor' and you'll have all the reason you'll ever need to blow your brains all over that cheap DaVinci print hanging on your bedroom wall.<br /><br />Directed by Michael Bay, mastermind of such craptasterpieces as 'Bad Boys' and 'Bad Boys 2' and produced by Jerry Bruckheimer of 'Kangaroo Jack' and 'Flashdance' fame comes this epically horrid World War II love story.  The lame story focuses on two losers(Ben 'Phantoms' Affleck and Josh 'Halloween H20' Harnett)who both are in love with a complete slut(Kate 'Van Helsing' Beckinsale).  They obviously shouldn't have fallen for this upscale prostitute but instead should have gathered all the native Hawaiians and stoned the crap out of her Mary Magdelene style.<br /><br />You would figure that a movie called 'Pearl Harbor' would actually be about the events that took place there.  Instead we get a pathetically acted, horribly scripted, and all around lame pile of fecal-tinged love story that overshadows the epic event that was the bombing of Pearl Harbor.<br /><br />Maybe I'm being too harsh, but if you like piss-poor and melodramatic excrement, then this film just might be your cup of tea.  Myself, I rate 'Pearl Harbor' slightly better than 'Dirty Dancing', but tied with 'Titanic' as the worst movie ever made.
B00U6AYEB0|5|I think that the negative reviews are reeling from the change in sound.  This is a good album, in my opinion.  The sound is nothing like &#34;Sigh No More&#34; and &#34;Babel.&#34;  However, that doesn't make it bad.  Yes, those albums created a distinctive sound for which Mumford and Sons are now known, a distinctive sound for which M&S are now loved.  And now they've gone and gotten all experimental on us and, at least for now, changed their sound.  Let's not abandon ship, though, just because there's a change.  I like the sound and feel of &#34;Sigh No More&#34; and &#34;Babel&#34; much better than &#34;Wilder Mind,&#34; at least for now, as I'm open to the fact that tastes may change.  But I like &#34;Wilder Mind&#34; by itself for what it has to offer, and that's just good music from one of my favorite groups.

B000092Q7O|4|This is a poignant tale of one Jewish man's horrific, yet ironically privileged journey through the holocaust. The protagnist is a gifted pianist from a well-to-do family. Naturally, he has good connections, and so avoids the train to a death camp. He struggles through various hiding places, gets used by a wartime profiteer, and triumphs by surviving a time so many did not. Throughout this production we are treated to gentle, somber, yet hopeful piano music that touches any heart that has ears to hear. <br /> <br />The holocaust, and Nazi treatment of Jews is rightly an almost sacred era in history. We quiet ourselves, offer our respect an admiration to those Jews who suffered through the period--as well as to the succeeding generations. Of course, we also wonder how humanity could do such a thing--and why anti-Semitism, and racism generally--continues to be so powerful. Thus, any film that crosses the threshold of solid and good, cannot help but earn kudos. <br /> <br />Bottom line: The Pianist is a solid and good film. It presents a powerful individual story, well-told. However, the pacing was quiet slow, and, in reality, this type of story has been done quite often. So, competition is stiff, and the bar should be quite high for a five-star rating. So, well worth seeing, but falls into the second-tier of holocaust-topic movies.  For a more original treatment, I recommend Jakob the Liar (Robin Williams 1999) instead.

Most of the information that I needed was only available by paying, so while this is supposed to be a free app, much of the information is not available without paying for it.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|This game is God's game. It's the best game ever being created - in my point of view.
B00DVKOYBM|5|This game is so fun.  You play with folks from around the world.  Your choice of one on one or tournaments.
B001E75QH0|5|I have always been a fan of the Indiana Jones movies.  I even wear a nice Fedora.  Having them all in one box is just too convenient.  Awesome product, great sellers here on Amazon .
B000002UAR|5|I have not yet heard this album, but it says &quot;The Beatles&quot; on the back cover, so it must be a 5 star recording!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Makes it so much easier to watch TV in my room and makes my cheap TV act better than a smart TV. The interface is easy to use and installation took under 2 minutes!
B0098460O4|4|We watched Jonathan and Charlotte really grow on the show. Their voices are heavenly together and the songs are very relaxing.
B00785P2QC|4|very entertaining game fun for kids and adults. keeps me going for hours not to mention keeping the kids out of my hair for awhile. play virtual city builder.
B005CA4SJW|5|Not sure what it is about this TV show, I certainly did not expect to be hooked on a show about zombies!, but I love this show!
0143038419|5|Books that help transform me to be a better human being are not usually on the best seller's list but Elizabeth Gilbert writes in such a delightful way and uses words and phrases that made me think.  She spoke with honesty which was often shocking, but showed 'guts'.  Often was a laugh-out-loud book with much humor along with Wisdom.  She is a real free spirit which will cause you to sin - the sin of envy, jealousy and the list goes on.    Highly recommended - not only for women. I will be watching for next book.
B00BAXFAOW|1|This book can easily be summarized in a few pages.<br /><br />Sometimes I hate books that stretch forever in order to fill the pages. Over 300+ pages of just repetitious stories.<br /><br />Some of these examples were completely not resonating. I get the ideas of a big fish in a little pond, however it doesn’t really help in the reality of life. It’s almost like denigrating the value of watching the Olympic, the NBA, the World Cup, etc. How does a person who want to compete in those elite team but do not have the capability to do so? How does a David and Goliath story apply here?<br /><br />I wouldn’t waste time on this book. There’re a few good points around how you need to be smart and apply yourself in the areas that you can excel.<br /><br />But don’t kid yourself if you want to be on the top of the game. This is not the book that will help.
B0002KZAKS|5|Professional microphones for sure . Bought 3 of them
B00INIXVMK|5|Facinating and extremely well written book. Balanced, objective, it is positively addictive in it's complexity but still easy to read.
B006885FZI|5|Loved it
B00881VLCE|3|Limited puzzles but entertaining.
B000H0MKGK|5|If you are thinking of purchasing any of John Mayer's work, I strongly recommend his latest CD, \\"CONTINUUM.\\" This is a great CD with social issues being touched on, like \\"Waiting On The World To Change\\" and many love songs like \\"Dreaming With A Broken Heart.\\" I believe this is his best CD by far.
B002XXPNXG|1|The movie itself is good but the High Definition version I watched was worse than standard definition.  Much of the time you couldn't even recognize their faces.  I had just recently viewed the HD version on Amazon Instant Video of the movie for which this is a sequel, \\"Before Sunrise\\", and that was in actual HD as it should have been.  I watched the whole thing instead of stopping because there's no method to get a credit or refund for a bad product.
B000002L61|5|need i say more to give a legend just five stars man thats not good .i say give dio more then five stars this album kicks its that good.mystical and magical dio is great atmospher to his work .he is truly not only a music  artist but a artist in general ....gives you feelings of medieval times and  dragons ,princesses,kings castles nice feelings come from listening to  dio.need i say more.this dude still has it ..the last in line is by far one  of the best metal albums ever and needs to be recognized and not forgottne  as so many of these real metal bands have thats why we need the underground  bands to push them mainstreamer back where they came from so this stuff can  make a come back rather then be forgotten.thanks cya
B000BBOUU4|2|If you type \\"therapy,\\" \\"therapist,\\" or, \\"counseling\\" in to any search engine you will get, literally, millions and millions of returns, and you won't disturb anyone or air your problems in public.<br /><br />I guess no one ever told Tim Burton about search engines because he, evidently, views movie making as a bizarre form of public therapy for his unhappy childhood and, as a result, he continuously inflicts his parental issues on the movie going public by re-creating established icons in his own emotionally knee-capped image.<br /><br />This time around the classic he trashes is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Giving lip service to making a totally faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's fantastic book, Mr. Burton instead took to immediately turning Willy Wonka into an emotional cripple because his daddy was too strict and wouldn't nurture his creative candy ideas. {replace the word `candy' with `movie' and viola' Willy Wonka becomes Tim Burton! How'd that happen?!}<br /><br />It isn't just Wonka whose psyche' has been converted to a dark abyss, no that would be to easy. All the parents who accompany their kids on the tour are totally worthless; they stand around and watch their children getting maimed and hardly raise a fuss or ask a question. They were pretty useless in the book too but at least they made some noise about their kids getting axed. Grandpa Joe is okay because he isn't technically Charlie's `parent' so it's alright for him to be nice in Mr. Burton's world.<br /><br />The ending from the book has also been cast aside so Mr. Burton can spend an extra half hour beating the dead horse of mean, uncaring parents and their emotionally stunted children. And what is the payoff for this extra time stolen from your life? We find out that Old Man Wonka has been secretly proud of his son's accomplishments all these years but he was too proud to say \\"I love you.\\" Dare to dream, Tim.<br /><br />Now let's talk about casting; Johnny Depp has no business in this film whatsoever, even on his best day he would be totally wrong for this part, and this is NOT his best day. His uneven and bizarre performance has an extremely creepy child molester quality that is very hard to watch and is about a million miles away from the character that Roald Dahl created. In fact the entire film is poorly cast with two exceptions; Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and Julia Winter as Veruca Salt. Both did very well with what they had to work with.<br /><br />Danny Elfman's score, which is usually the one bright spot in a Tim Burton film, doesn't work at all here. It almost sounds as if Mr. Elfman has run out of ideas for making Burtons films palatable and just phoned it in to get it over with. The Oompa Loompa songs, however, are very catchy and pretty well done. The one complaint about them is that the words are important but they are frequently intelligible because of the music. In the book those lyrics, and Wonka's reaction to them, help set the tone of the story and establish that all is not what it seems.<br /><br />I have avoided mentioning the 1971 version until now because I wanted the majority of this review to deal with Burton's remake and little else, but it is impossible to ignore the other film because Burton made such a point of publicly distancing his version from it. And therein lies the biggest obstacle to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; the original adaptation of Roald Dahl's book nailed the magical yet dangerous feel of the factory so well and, Gene Wilder's portrayal of Willy Wonka was so spot on with the book that when Burton distanced his film from them he, in effect, prohibited his own movie from capturing the nature of the book or it's lead characters.<br /><br />Avoid this film if you can.

B005OCFGTO|5|My grandson has read all the books and loves the movies. He was so excited to get the complete series. Highly recommend.
B005V2EVBQ|5|Some of the reviews were negative and I had my fears but the case looked to be what I wanted.  Fortunately I was correct in ordering this case, it is exactly what I wanted.  It's light yet does exactly what I want as far as protecting my Kindle.  I like that it easily folds open and around so that with one hand I can hold and read my kindle in bed at night.  That is mainly how I use my Kindle.<br /><br />I'm sure you'll like this cover too, it's just what the good Kindle needs.
B00CWY76CC|4|Fun and challenging at the same time.  Once you think you are getting the idea on how to play the game gets more challenging.<br />Clues are right in front of you and you don't even see them.  My daughter is 11 and really enjoys this app.

B00EOARZ4G|5|Tom Clancy book's have been compelling reading for sometime.  However, I found this to his best work.  I recommend it to any Tom Clancy fan.
B000002J1L|4|In 1970, after two failed albums,Genesis faced an uncertain future. To add to that, their guitarist Anthony Phillips, and their drummer John Mayhew, had left the band. Peter Gabriel, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks found two replacements for the departed members in guitarist Steve Hackett, and drummer Phil Collins. This lineup would make some of the most spectacular music ever.<br />Nursery Cryme, recorded and released in 1971, was their first album together. The first song, a 10 minute epic called &quot;The Musical Box,&quot; is almost worth the entire album alone. I is probably their heaviest song, and one of the their darkest (musically). The band clicks together, despite sludgy production, with Collins playing drums like a madman, Steve Hackett's amazing guitar solos, and of course, the magnificent vocals of Peter Gabriel, who was an effective vocalist even as an unknown 21 year old. One of the best songs ever. &quot;Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot; is another epic, and it's very heavy and apocalyptic, again with Steve Hackett's guitar being a prominent instrument, which it wasn't most of the time when he was in the band, and Tony Banks making some worthy contributions to the song. The piano part starting the end of the song is one of the most beautiful pieces of music he ever wrote. <br />The rest of the album is somewhat ofa letdown, compared to those 2 powerful songs, though songs like those are hard to top. Phil Collins makes his first appearance as a lead vocalist in the brie but pleasant &quot;For Absent Friends.&quot; &quot;Seven Stones,&quot; a song that usually gets slack from a lot of fans, is another rather dark and somber song, and it's a great song. &quot;Harold the Barrel&quot; gives insight into their playful and bizarre side, which was more evident on subsequent albums, &quot;Harlequin&quot; is a simple acoustic song w/ pretty good vocal harmonies. The last song, &quot;The Fountain of Salmacis&quot; is 8 minutes long, but it doesn't strike me asmuch as it does the other 2 epics on this album. The band would improve themselves on their next 3 albums, but Nursery Cryme is a very transistional album and a very important album to the band, and it's worth the purchase for many of the songs.
B007GCY8FS|5|A lady I work with suggested Lee Child a few months ago and I decided to read them all in order, just finished 17 and have enjoyed them all.  I'll start 18 tonight, excellent reads.
B008YRVW0I|5|I can not stop Playing this is a grate game love that game.
B0014WSWTY|5|These recordings are just fantastic. The Beethoven symphonies have been done over and over, what makes this so special is the original orchestrations on period instruments using the original markings by Beethoven. Coupled with this is using the original turnings at a lower cycle so instead of 440 they are at around 420 so the sound is slightly darker and warmer.<br /><br />Finally, buy a set to add to any others as you will not play those again.
B000001FQR|5|I'm definitely not in my 40's.  You need to go north of 60 to figure my age. I like the up-beat music on this CD.  Originally, when I heard it, CD's were not in the stores...only in the tech. parts of newspapers.  I bought the CD's and cassettes again.  Why the cassettes?; some friends are not out of the middle 20th century.  It was music for exercise workouts, fast walking, peppy house cleaning...not considered too offensive.  I passed the cassettes to my \\"old\\" friends who are glad to hear it again.  And we have begun to do at least housework and other chores while having it for background music.  Yes, we still like \\"Hot In the Shade.\\"  My grandchildren have a CD and they like the \\"earlier\\" stuff.  It is good.  If you have not heard it in a long time or you have never heard it...you owe it to yourself to \\"check it out.\\"  What is \\"old\\" could easily become \\"new\\" again.  I prefer to remain nameless, but hey, why should that even matter.  Diane
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Loved it........I cannot say enough about this show.  I love the way the upstairs and downstairs characters are so interwined.  The clothing is beautiful as well as the decor of that era.
B00NH13W2W|5|This item is very excellent and I would recommend purchase it. Wi-Shi from Amazon do not hesitate to buy it. Amazon is the meaning of credibility and quality. I love all items of the Amazon to their credibility and their quality and good dealings. And especially international connectivity.
B001FB4VXU|5|my husband decided to buy this for himself and then bought all of the other seasons and trust me he watches them over and over and over again
1932100660|5|I am a man of 70 years and in excellent health.  I'm 5' 10\\" and weigh 150 pounds. I can still jog 5 miles and not feel tired or short of breath - even after two hours at the gym.  My lab test results would suggest that I am a young man.<br /><br />This is NOT genetic good fortune:  My mother died of a heart attack at age 58.  Heart disease and mental illness runs in the family on my mother's side. Alzheimer's disease and cancer runs in my family on my father's side.  Fortunately for me, I was raised in Los Angeles foster care until I emancipated myself at age 15.  In foster care, I hardly ever was fed meat or fish.<br /><br />On my own, I simply had better eating hab8ts than most Americans  For example, I don't eat butter or margarine.  I hardly ever eat in a restaurant.  I prepare my own meals that are fairly lite on animal portions and heavy on vegetables, whole grains, and fruit.  I drink skim milk and rarely drink anything with added sugar or caffeine in it.<br /><br />The last couple years I have been getting positive reinforcement for my eating habits from several books, written by physicians and PhD's.  But after reading \\"The China Study\\" I find I can still improve my eating habits.  I eat more added fats and more protein than I should, and I could make some better food choices.<br /><br />\\"The China Study\\" not only SEEMS sensible, it is well documented.  Every assertion is backed up using scientifically valid research methods, and every chapter has a long list of references near the back of the book - just before the index.  And the reader doesn't have to have a college education to understand the contents.  Of all the health improvement books I have ever read, this one is the best.  It is more scientific, better documented, and broader in scope than any of the others - although most of the others were helpful.
B00IIUATDM|3|Nice film. One of his many.
B00I3ULQQ6|5|This review is for the Shell Crystal case - it arrived in one day (free Prime shipping) and is it a really nice case for my new S5.  I wanted a clear case to display the great, hi-tech looking Samsung rear cover and layered chrome frame, but it had to be very slim also, almost not noticeable on the phone but providing an adequate degree of protection in case I drop it.  This was not expensive at all and turns out to be exactly what I was looking for.  The fit is very precise, the craftsmanship is perfect, the clarity is like looking through crystal, and it's not soft and rubbery, yet it's flexible enough to put on and take off the phone easily.  I'm glad I didn't go for the $35 case the T-Mobile guy offered me - this was about a third of that and much nicer.  As always, I appreciate the quality and fast shipping service of most everything I purchase at Amazon. I highly recommend this or another of the Spigen line of cellphone cases, both for beauty and protection.
B00FFT1BJ0|5|Excellent sound track. I loved the feature of it instantly going to my amazon cloud player while the cd was shipped. This way I could listen on my phone and computer, before the cd arrived. Excellent sound and I listen to it almost every morning on my way to work.
B00E3D7WGU|1|Fans of Madonna who have watched the actual MDNA world tour live will undoubtedly be disappointed in the sound on this release. I saw her show in Copenhagen and it sounded nothing like the audio on this release. How can I describe the sound? Madonna's vocals are mixed way too loud, the music seems to burried deeply in the mix with a lot of instrumentation missing and audience noise is rather loud. This leads me to believe that the mastering went wrong. I suspect the center channel was mixed with rear surround channels and omitted the actual front channel sound - to create a faulty stereo mix. Using Dolby Surround on the stereo mix pretty much confirms this: the center channel is loud and contains the vocals (as it should) - however the left and right front speakers are very, very low. Nothing comes from the rear speakers.<br /><br />This is not a bashing of the actual show or the sound quality at the actual shows but this CD is not mastered correctly.<br /><br />If you want to hear how it really should sound, look at youtube for Madonna's performance at the L'Olympia.
B003JTHXOK|5|shocking ending with a punch,so not expected but so fitting with the story when you review the body of the  book  more then just a good story.  Read it.
B00FEMJF6O|3|Highly addictive, but hard to get items, and very expensive. If it wasn't for it being so hard to get special items, I would have gave this 5 stars.
B0086700CM|5|best app in history of apps!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love temple run..... it is such an adicting game.....I can never stop playing
B0055V0HXO|3|(Note : I really wanted to rate this 3 1/2 star as I think it's a bit better than just 3 stars)<br /><br />Being a huge fan of Karmakanic's \\"Who's the boss in the factory\\" - not to mention the Flower Kings and other swedish prog - I was very much looking forward to this album. While I wouldn't say that I was necessarily disappointed in \\"In a perfect world\\", I will say that I don't think it was on par with \\"Who's the Boss\\". I can't really point to any one thing I didn't care for on the album, but none of the songs really impressed me as being more than well written, but pretty straight forward modern prog in the same vein as Flower Kings.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Turn it up\\" is a strong effort that sounds like something that could break into radio rotation on quite a few stations. \\"Can't Take it with you\\" is also a lot of crunchy, macabre fun but in the end, there's just not enough on this album that sets it apart from many other albums just like it.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I'm not sorry I bought the album, I have enjoyed listening to it and I don't think if you're a fan of their earlier stuff or just modern prog in general you'll regret buying this album if you decide to do so. However, if you're limited on funds (like most of us) then this album can probably wait for now.
B0064MPXFA|5|A smart, well written show.  The characters are well developed, and I find myself watching ever free moment I have.
B000MKD9P6|3|Can't go wrong with MS. Cute movie
B00GY0HJ4K|4|Lots of fun when you need a quick relaxer.  Very easy, be sure to read all hints of what to do,
B005PK56TA|2|I watched the full first season, mostly because of Jessica Lange (and because it was free).<br /><br />Each episode was pretty much a repeat of the one before it, just with a few more perversions and evil deads thrown in.  By the end, even Jessica was annoying me.  A mindless celebration of violence and gore.
B00005B36H|5|Like every Tool album I have listened ot so far (i.e. bought), this record requires (at least for me) a few turns before I can really get into the music. Which is good, because generally my favorite stuff is that which makes me say &quot;Whaaa...?&quot; upon first hearing it.<br />I would definitely say that Lateralus is an &quot;experience&quot;, as it has been said, though I feel &quot;Aenima&quot; deserves the same credit. It is interesting to see in this album how the band has progressed over the years -- musically, they have evolved to sound completely unlike the Tool of &quot;Opiate&quot;. They're more refined. I see a few elements of A Perfect Circle slipping through the cracks, too, msot notably in &quot;The Patient&quot;.<br />I was sort of worried about this album taking so long to be released -- NIN apparently had a similar incubation period and came out of it with their weakest album so far -- but I think Lateralus is just as strong as Tool's previous albums. In other words, buy it.<br />One thing that struck me as odd is that I have not heard a single expletive on this album. Granted, Maynard's words are often hard to decipher, but I really think this record is without cursing. Amazing, considering that most hard rock, especially the angry kind (Lateralus being of mixed emotions), deoends on them. Even Tool, with songs like &quot;Hush&quot;, &quot;Swamp Song&quot;, and &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot;, normallys uses them frequently. Twenty, thirty years down the line, I could probably listen to this album with my kids in the back seat and not feel like I needed to cover their ears.<br />In the words of Maynard: &quot;Buy my new record. Send more money.&quot;
B000KX0IOA|5|This is worth watching. Ben Kingsley looked like Gandhi. This is lovely real story. I highly recommend to all. Go for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This is forever my favorite novel. John Green, you are amazing. Have not found a flaw in any of this. I recommend this to everyone.
B00HBQWGXK|5|good reading. i like all the jack reacher series books
B00HZ4ASEC|4|This movie had a good theme and the characters were enjoyable.  Definitely a movie worth watching.
B00BJ9VBLI|5|Great game. Loved it on Pc now on my kindle too. it is a large file so occasionally runs slow.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|This'll be a quick review for those who don't want to read a twelve page in-depth expose; for those who do, just scroll around a bit.<br /><br />This is an absolutely solid mouse. It's slightly larger than my previous mice; I find I'm still able to claw grip it, although it's far more comfortable to palm grip this mouse. All the buttons (to my surprise) are excellently placed and easily distinguishable by touch, not to mention a cinch to program. Adjustable weight is always a nice touch as well.<br /><br />Basically, if you want a great mouse for a good price, you've found it. Short of having a keypad on the side, this mouse offers options to satisfy even a hardcore gamer: multiple profile setups, on-board memory, adjustable polling rate (up to 1000hz) and DPI (8000 DPI is no joke), aesthetically attractive, and ergonomically designed.<br /><br />At $40, this is the best mouse your money can buy.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Love my Suits!!
B00VFTAXUC|2|Movie's plain silly but it does fill the time, with one bit of suspense, heightened by amazing organ music, after another.  The stars try their best to  add some human interest, but with what they have to work with, the robots are more interesting.  And as for deep thinking about love, the meaning of life, and the like, you're better off reading Doonesbury.
B005544TRQ|5|Excellent show!. Great characters and limited offensive language. Good and educational plots.
B00B5HQL50|1|If you're inclined to watch this movie, PLEASE go to the Amazon site for it and read the one-star reviews.  This movie was awful.  In so many ways, it was awful.  It wasn't stylish, the dialog was terrible, the action sequences were boring (yes, boring) and the characters unbelieveable.  I loved Craig in Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace was OK but this movie was awful.  The overriding  theme was noise and more noise.  Don't bother with this one.
B009FZFONO|5|The Walking Dead is in the highest echelons of zombie themed cinematography.  On top of superior special effects makeup, amazing set design and unrivaled zombie slaying, the storyline is riveting and never leaves a dull moment.
B006LSZECO|5|This book is simply fantastic. Gillian Flynn keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the entire novel. I loved the suspense of not knowing what would happen next throughout the whole book!
B002MQYOFW|5|Wonderful book. I could not put this down. I recommend this to anyone who loves a great story. I have the next book in this series and will start on it today.
B00992CF6W|5|I love it its the best game in the world!!!!!!!!!! You should get the app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also love now you can create stuff and I love that you can connect with people and if you kill them you get all three stuff they have!!!!!!!!!!!
B00062IDCO|4|Nice sci-fi adventure that follows along it the &#34;Star Trek&#34; fashion. Good action, solid plot lines. Has Jeri Ryan too...
B00VFTCGES|4|Pretty good. Looking forward to sequel.
B0089EHWQE|5|This is the best book I've ever read, I laughed, cried, I was angry... All kinds of emotions.. It's a great book
B007FH9GT2|5|This book was slow to get started but once it did I couldn't put it down. You have to pay attention because it jumps around and if you are not careful the characters get jumbled. But a very good book that just keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way to the end. I have read the whole series and all we excellence.
B006MW3V6U|5|The series is very well done--great photography, memorable and sympathetic characters, enough plot twists to keep up interest.  I am really enjoying it.
B007SGM084|5|I loved it! My favourite character was Christian. I read Grey and  I prefer the book from his point of view. This book spoke to me beyond the sex.  Although the sex was good. I don't usually read romance. The love story is wonderful. Watching the healing unfold for Christian was nice.
B00BVYNSLC|5|I love this show! Tatiana amazes me with each new clone!
B00000K3D4|5|Good
B003O86FMW|5|Love this book. Easy read, keeps you captivated and wanting more. The author really knows how to paint a picture on the readers mind, it's like your watching a movie in your head. I want more, and can't wait to read the third book. Completely 100% recommend this trilogy.
B00PTB7B34|5|Good gaaaaame
B005FSI1IK|5|If you have not read the Vorkosigan series by Bujold you are missing out on some of the best literature of modern times. Bujold's writing is supurb, her story lines are always interesting and her characterizations wonderful. You do not have to be a Science fiction buff to enjoy the Vorkosigan series as the books contain a mixture of plot lines, ranging from hard military SF, through espionage, political drama, social drama, romance, mystery and comedy, often all within the same book.<br />A Civil campaign is a story of political intrigue, a study in the effects of technology on biology and a regency romantic comedy all rolled into one science fiction book that is a delight to read and re-read.<br />It would be best to at least read Komarr, the previous book in the series, before reading A Civil campaign to get more background, but better still to read the whole series.<br />The are no SF writers that I have found that write as well as Bujold. Her stories are delight ti read.
0399255370|2|I don't care for this book at all. Weirdly sad :-/<br />Did not give it to my grand children as planned. Will return it.
B000002A46|5|I love this CD.  I bought this one for a friend because she loved mine.  It's such a happy, upbeat album, with some serious Xmas carols also.

B00F35B8F8|4|What seemed like a clone of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan turned out to be different. The cast of the 2009 reboot returns to dazzle Trekkies new and old with impressive special effects, a compelling plot, and and an amazing soundtrack.
B00005V1Z0|1|I never expected this to be a masterpiece of cinematography, but, my god, this was unbelievably bad, from beginning to end.<BR> <BR>Good things first: Angelina Jolie is hot.<br />Bad things: everything else.<BR>I mean, it's okay if a movie doesn't have a decent story if the rest is entertaining, even it's stupid and unrealistic (see \\"The Mummy\\").<BR>Tomb Raider, however, lacks everything a movie should have. <BR>It's not entertaining, only boring and inane to the maximum. <BR>Now, to the bad things:<br />First, the \\"story\\": One gigantic hot air balloon, mixing esoteric mumbo-jumbo with Illuminati conspiracies, Jolie ... , pseudoarcheology and Jolie... .... Confusing and no meaning whatsoever.<br />Then, the special effects: Somehow everything looks unreal, like made out of plastic, even the \\"real\\" stuff like Jolie's mansion. Go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark, they did a better job 20 years ago.<br />Characters? Who needs characters when you've got ...  explosions and gunfire every 10 seconds? So, there's absolutely no problem in introducing a female,good looking, superwealthy, highly intelligent female ex-special forces member that studied archaeology and can read or speak almost every language fluently. She always knows what to do, what to say, how to defeat 10 armed commandos without guns, everything.<BR>Not even slightly unrealistic.<br />This is easily the worst movie ever made. Hysterical, unnecessarily fast paced, and so inane it makes \\"The Mummy\\" look like a documentary. Avoid it at all cost.
B007IXWL2C|5|This book may be the last in the trilogy but the suspense in this book is about three or even four times greater than the first two. The turn of events are unexpected but the intensity of Christian and Ana's love story remains in tact. I find both characters more mature and the battles that they fight in this story lead them to discover more about each other in a way that can be described as both romantic and brutal - at least for me.
1401310672|4|VERY FUNNY !
B00HFX5ZT6|3|My fault, I did not realize it was Blu-ray.  We scheduled a time for our family to have a &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; marathon, then my son noticed it was Blu-ray.  We now need to do some comparisons to select and purchase a blue-ray player.  At this point we have not yet seen the Box set.
B000NYT1M6|5|Got it for my grandson's birthday.  He loved it.  He had help from his cousins to figure out the details of opening the doors and adjusting the mirrors.  They all had fun with it.  I really like how sturdy it is.  The colors are great and love the MACK emblem up front.  Lot's of detail.
B00HVJB4VM|4|Good book but sometimes hard to follow the financial schemes.  Shakes your confidence  (or what ever is left) in Wall Street.
B001BZRUR4|5|This story was mesmerizing.  I couldn't wait to read the next chapter.  Well written, often with lovely language and metaphors.  I highly recommend this book and it is definitely not limited to any particular audience.  Would make a great book club selection.
0452273331|5|Best fiction I've read since college.<br />Should be required reading, as up to date today as when it was written
B000JMKO0A|4|i like it because it reflects the reality of this life with its bad and good aspects. i recommend it
1401938906|5|This book is very well written.  The experiments are fun and it's especially good to give the book to a friend and read it together and share the results.  I truly believe in the Law of Attraction and that what you focus on grows.  This book was a very fun way to see that in action.
B00AEK9BKQ|5|This is a very good movie that  brings to light some things most of us would never even think about....and rarely could imagine. It gives a whole new perspective on disability AND sex, and does it in an effective and loving manner.  Cast is remarkable. Helen Hunt is a brave woman.
B00008OWZC|5|This album is unbelievable. It gives you a live album from Zep that came from when they were in their prime. This album is true Led Zeppelin in it's rawest form. They completely blow my mind away with this album. YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!!
B00004XQP4|4|This is a good CD. It is not as good as Green Day's older stuff, such as Kerplunk, 39 Smooth, and Dookie. It is still a great CD. Misery is different from the other stuff, but is probably my favorite song. I would reccomend everyone to buy this CD, mainly because it's Green Day and they Rock!!!
0399229191|4|My two-year-old and I love this book.  It's about a spider who blows in, lands on a fence post, and spends the entire day building a web.  She keeps working as various animals tempt her to do other things.  At the end of the day, she catches a fly in her web and then falls asleep, tuckered out from  her busy day.  This book has several things going for it.  First, it is a  very simple narrative, making it one of the first stories that your child  will be able to understand.  Second, it is repetitive.  Toddlers LOVE  repetition and it is good for them.  It helps them stay focused on the  story, and gives them a chance to &quot;read&quot; something themselves,  because they will naturally recite the repetitive bits as you come to them.   Last of all, this book has several animals and the noises they make--very  important for that fund of knowledge you are building.  Oh, and I forgot  the kicker:  The spider web is made of some sort of 3D glue, making it  tactile.  My son loves running his fingers along it.  I would have given  this book 5 stars, but I love Carle's THE VERY HUNGRY CATERPILLAR even  more!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Because google.
B007PTJOV0|1|stupid place to place multiple adds<br />right on the forward arrow key!  Enjoyed game until they slammed the ads. impossible to play correctly. be aware!
B0089LOG02|5|Easy and interesting read. It makes me want to read more about orphan trains and their riders' lives.  I recommend this book to probably anyone over 13.
B00003CXA6|4|As a Civil War buff, I found the film to be very historically accurate with only a few fictional moments.  Ronald Maxwell undoubtedly researched this battle for years and came out on top of all other depictions of that battle that turned the war.  The defense of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge was so real that I had to visit the site once again to replay it in my mind.  Sheen as Lee was brilliant, Berenger portrayal was irreproachable and the casting of the entire film was near perfection.  The part of Sgt. Kilrain, while fictional, was inspirational and encompassed the spirit of someone who must have been in that battle. While more men died at Gettysburg in three days than in the entire Viet Nam war, one has to be seriously moved to imagine the scope of that battle that changed the war and saved the nation.  &quot;Gettysburg&quot; will remain in the halls of great films forever.
B00E5Q1HJS|4|A good action movie. A good choice for movie night, with a bowl of popcorn and fairly low expectations.
B00009YOQW|5|My 4 year old loves this drum.  It's beautiful and well made.  I can see this toy being a Christmas decoration after he's outgrown it.  It's small, but a good size for little hands.  The drum has three different tones, so my son has had fun experimenting with the different sounds the drum can make.  Yes, it's noisy (of course), but not obnoxious.  It's not gender specific, so my 5 year old daughter loves it, too.  It was popular with the grand-kids in the family, who range from 1 to 5.  That's the age range I'd recommend for this toy.
B00BLCHZC2|5|This show is made by people who keep it exciting and accurate!  I can't wait for the next season to become available.
B00006JDU9|5|Love all the Star Wars including this one!
B00IIOFVYA|5|I love this game. It's another great g5 mysteries with many exciting plot twists. I enjoyed it very much, and never wanted to stop playing.
B0020BUWX2|5|I really enjoyed this book. Any one who loves a romance would like this book. I love how the main character has a out of the body experience. Be sure to also read the sequel. You will want to know what happens next
B007PTJOV0|4|it is an okay game it is very tricky the bad thing about it is that when you lose all your life's. you start. over
B006LSZECO|4|Thought provoking dark comedy with plenty of surprises. I'll definitely be reading more Gillian Flynn titles in the future. Good read!
B009DKFSUA|4|I'd give this 5 stars but to me a 5 star rating means the album is an all time classic. This disc is fantastic, but not a classic... If the songs on this disc don't get you moving in your seat or dancing along at home than nothing will. Very good beats, good collaborations and just a good disc to listen to. There are a couple of weak songs but all in all this disc is a fun time. This is my first Pitbull disc and I was extremely happy.
B000K4WPCC|1|The Covenant (Renny Harlin, 2006)<br /><br />Sometimes, when you put two negative forces together, you get a positive. So there was hope that when director Renny Harlin, who hasn't made a good movie in... well, okay, ever, and writer J. S. Cardone, who's not awful when he's directing (Wicked Little Things was his), but is awful when he's writing (The Forsaken and Alien Hunter both bear his mark), the collision would result in something blindingly brilliant, the kind of movie that proved both actually had serious chops, though it would probably be a fluke. Unfortunately, and somewhat predictably, it was not to be.<br /><br />The Covenant is the deeply confusing, badly-paced, incredibly silly story of five modern-day kids who are descended from the five founding families of Ipswich, Massachusetts, where the Salem Witch Trials supposedly began. Four of the families survived the witch trials, and the scions of each clan are about to turn eighteen (and \\"ascend\\" into their full power). The de facto leader of the bunch is Caleb (Sky High's Steven Strait), who's on the verge of turning eighteen. Pogue (Snakes on a Plane's Taylor Kitsch) is his best friend. Opposite these two are Reid (Toby Hemingway, recently of Feast of Love) and his best friend Tyler (Chace Crawford of Gossip Girl fame). While their bonds run deep, Caleb and Reid are constantly at odds; Reid likes to use his power (for, yes, they're all witches) despite the fact that overuse of the power turns one into a withered husk, while Caleb counsels moderation. As they begin their senior year at an exclusive private high school, two disruptive forces enter the playing field: Sarah (Venom's Laura Ramsey), to whom Caleb immediately gravitates, and Chase (Red Doors' Sebastian Stan), whom Pogue suspects of moving in on Pogue's girl Kate (Cloverfield's Jessica Lucas), who also happens to be Sarah's roommate. To top it all off, there are a bunch of minor subplots running around in the first half of the film. Given all this, and me just touching the tip of the iceberg, is it any wonder the thirty-second TV spots made absolutely no sense?<br /><br />Watching the entire ninety-minute film doesn't make things much better. A little more time is taken to explain things, but not much. It doesn't help that it's obvious the film is setting up a straw man as the villain (for the real villain must be revealed later on, ha-HA!). This is forgivable, and handled well, of course, it can be an excellent plot device. The problem is it's not handled well at all; after the big reveal halfway through the film, the straw man simply disappears into thin air, never to be seen again. This is the case with a number of those minor subplots I mentioned when attempting to recount the labyrinthine first half of the script, as well; it seems the second half is the movie everyone here wanted to make, but they didn't have anything to set it up, so they grafted on another, more complex (and more interesting) script that no one would produce. Done right and extended correctly, the first half of this movie would have made an interesting thriller. Done right and extended correctly, the second half of this movie would have been a mightily enjoyable, brainless action flick (though the zooming-ball-of-water special effects should really have been thought through a little better). Squashed together, neither works. It doesn't help that most of the actors here are at best barely competent (it's ironic that Jessica Lucas, by far the most experienced actor here who gets more than a minute of screen time, is the most minor of the seven main characters). One wonders if others were approached beforehand, took one look at the script, and fled screaming in terror. *touching the tip of the iceberg, is it any wonder the thirty-second TV spots made absolutely no sense?

B0092MKFIY|5|This is definitely one of my favorite albums I've ever bought! Their music just rocks and makes you want to sing along and dance.
0441003257|5|This book is so amazing it is beyond words. I was laughing, I was crying (from the laughing), and I was completley consumed with the book from cover to cover. I have little to no knowledge of the Bible, getting what I know from resources other than the good book itself. I have to admit there were only a couple of times I had to ask my friends what certain religious things meant, but other than that the book was great at expressing each stage of Armagedon without confusing me. The book is simply hilarious, as I've allready said. The characters are amazing, of course I have my favorites but each one does such amazing job of pulling you into the story and helping you to imagine their own little world. My favorite pair, Crowley and Aziraphale working for their bosses from both hell and heaven respectfully, yet they don't want the world to end. They enjoy it to much. You even learn to love the antichrist in this book, Adam, and his 3 other companions, no matter how much mischief they cause. And, the hilarious trio of Witchfinder Sergeant Shadwell along with his new Private Newton Pulsifer and their interactions with Madame Tracy. Not to mention Sister Mary Loquacious the Satanic Nun of the Chattering Order of St. Beryl who make the whole story line pausible. The flow of the story is just so entertaining, and the wonderfully developed characters are the ones leading you on through the whole thing.
0691126658|5|Great for the birding enthusiast.  Our guides loved it , too.  Somewhat bulky to carry, but full of important details.
B003ZDZ1WG|5|I love this CD!!! The Band Perry is so refreshing a great new band! I recommend this CD to Everyone! It's great country. They harmonize like only siblings can. I can't wait to hear more from this amazing new band!
B003ZDZ1WG|5|I would recommend this CD, great for anyone that likes country music or even pop. She has a great voice.
1451666179|5|Every once in awhile something happens that reminds me I do not know myself as well as I think I do. I like to think I know myself fairly well. I spend almost every day with myself, I am introspective by nature, and I would say around 70 to 80 percent of my time is spent thinking about my own thoughts and feelings, trying to figure them out. So, it can be a shock when I suddenly realize how uninformed I am even about very simple things. Things I should know. For example, I think I know what kinds of books I like. I spend a lot of time reading and researching books and I usually get a sense of whether I will like a book or not by simply looking at the cover and reading the description. I am often right and when I am right it confirms the illusion that I am an expert on my own taste. But I am often wrong. I can say unequivocally that, if I had come across this book by Allie Brosh in the bookstore, I would NOT have picked it out for myself in a million years.<br /><br />Luckily, someone else prodded me to read this. I was down visiting family last week and my sister had this book and recommended I try reading it. Normally, I do not like it when people recommend books to me. I wind up feeling pressured to read them, and I think I know what I like to read better than other people. However, I could tell from all the pictures in this book that it was not going to require a huge investment of time so I decided to read just the first couple of sections to placate my sister. I wound up enjoying it so much I read the whole book in two days. Whenever I had a small break from visiting family I immediately picked it up. The stories in the book are fairly short, they are written in a conversational style, and the pictures appear somewhat crude. The book looks like something that could be put together quickly and easily, but that is deceptive. Anyone who thinks that writing a book like this would be easy should try it: start a blog (this book was based on a blog) and see how long it takes to get a publisher interested in publishing your work. There is no doubt that a great deal of artistry went into making this book appear effortless.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever written anything - even something as simple as an amazon review - knows that it is not easy to write something that other people will actually be interested in reading. I am sure most of the people who started reading my review quit halfway through the first paragraph (if you have made it this far I thank you). It is not easy to tell a story that people want to pay attention to or turn mundane events into something genuinely humorous. Allie Brosh is a great storyteller. She condenses every story to its emotional core, she finds exactly what is funny about it, she leaves out all extraneous details, and conveys the story in as few words as possible. That is not easy to do.<br /><br />This book is more than just words though. Without the drawings this book would not be nearly as powerful. The drawings appear somewhat crude but they seem as if they were designed to connect with some primitive emotional part of our brain - at least, that was my experience reading it. Without the pictures it would be much more difficult to connect with the emotions in the stories. When we can actually see Allie's bewilderment over not being allowed to eat her grandmother's cake, her apathy sitting on the couch during her depression, or her mysterious sense of power as she gazes in the mirror with her dinosaur suit on, we connect with the stories on a deeper level than we would if we were just reading text (the dinosaur story is not actually in this book but is on Allie's blog).<br /><br />If this was just a book of humorous stories there is no way that it would have had the impact it has had. There is no way there would be over 2,000 amazon reviews. Of course the stories are funny, but the best humor - the humor we actually remember - always expresses some kind of emotional truth, and the drawings play abig part in conveying the emotional truths contained in this book. The \\"crudity\\" of the drawings is precisely what makes them so powerful. Perfectly drawn figures would not have even half the impact. This book genuinely is a work of art.<br /><br />On top of the humor and the emotional impact, Allie Brosh also demonstrates a great deal of psychological insight. I think humor and psychology are intimately connected. I doubt there has ever been a really funny comedian who did not spend a great deal of their time in psychological navel gazing. Allie's chapters on depression and identity were particularly interesting and funny (I especially liked the contradictory beliefs Allie held about herself, \\"skeptic\\", \\"probably has a pretty aura\\", etc.). The section on depression has been widely praised and for good reason. It manages to cut to the heart of what it feels like to be depressed and it charts a path through depression without resorting to sentimentality or feel-goodery. So, in conclusion, after reading this book I realized I do not know myself nearly as well as I thought. I apparently have no idea what kinds of books I like. But I am alright with that, especially when I get to be pleasantly surprised every once in awhile as I was with this book.onal truths contained in this book.

B007L3BMGA|1|This is just apalling...I cant for the life of me see why its on the best selling list. Is this the future of our literature? I cringe.
B000XUBFE2|5|Liesel wanted to learn how to read. She was taught how using The Grave Digger’s Handbook, a book she stole from the man who was digging her little brother’s grave. Her brother had died on the train en route to their foster parents. No one else seemed to care.<br /><br />She grew to love books and so her thievery of books continued. She stole books from Nazi book burnings and from the mayor’s own library. She became a better and better reader. As her days became more and more dangerous, books and the ability to read become ever more important.<br /><br />The narrator of this story is the grim reaper, an unusual, yet apropos viewpoint considering it was 1939 and death was busy gathering souls as the Nazis killed and killed and killed. On the other hand, Liesel’s foster mother’s crude language adds a bit of lightness and comic relief to this otherwise sad but hopeful story. It is moving, especially during her brother’s death and during the hiding of the Jewish man. It is tenderly and lovingly written as the family faces turmoil and loss.<br /><br />The characters are well written and the vivid settings are the perfect backdrop to the storyline. This book reads smoothly and easily. Zusak is a very talented writer. I highly recommend this unusual and well-written book.
B00ILHW6AG|3|I read all of Stephen King's books & this one was disappointing. It was not very Stephen King-ish & not scary at all. Also I knew what was gonna happen at the end before I got to the end. It was so-so, just not my type of book. Not scary enough.
B006OOHYIC|4|i recommend you try this game it is fun and challenging.  the only negative I would say is there are too many hints to help you through levels which you don't have to use but are tempting after failing a couple times
079215228X|5|A CLASSIC film.  One of my top ten of all time.  I usually don't watch movies because most do not capture my attention, but when Sam dies and comes back, that CAPTURED MY ATTENTION.  MUST, MUST COME OUT ON DVD.   PLEASE, PLEASE.  I would definitely buy and put it in my collection.
B007IXWKUK|5|truly enjoyed this book as much as the first book
B00006M183|5|This is, like every Pearl Jam album before, almost completely different from the previous albums.<br />It is probably most like a cross between Yield and Binaural.<br />The first time I listened to the album I wasn't overwhelmed, but, like all of their music, it grows on you (I didn't listen to Ten the whole way through until after Vs. was released...).<br />Love Boat Captain is probably the song I like the least that I could have liked a lot more.  I have the feeling that it is somewhat overdone.<br />Songs that stand out (to me at least) include : Green Disease, I Am Mine and Cropduster.  I think that Green Disease and Cropduster are two of my favorite Pearl Jam songs.  <br />The rest of the album is solid.  The feel of the album is more spontaneous than Binaural.  The vocals are nicely meshed with the rest of the music (unlike that mess of a recording 'Live on Two Legs'). <br />Basically, I'd say that if you like Yield, give this album a chance.  Listen to it through with headphones on a couple times.  Read along with the lyrics printed in the insert.  Use your imagination to see what the artist want you to see and feel. <br />I think that, if you have an open mind and if you give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.  Not everyone is going to like this album.  It is certainly not a 'Pop' record.  But, if you respect and enjoy the music that Pearl Jam has made, then buy this album.
B000002U8G|5|I saw the original tour for this album around 71/72 and let me just<br />say that they were a far better, more completely rounded band in those<br />days. Not that they are bad now, they are still great musicians, but<br />I had the pleasure to witness the band 3 times in concert BEFORE<br />they became huge after Dark Side. I saw them later during the<br />Wish You Were Here tour and Animals tour and felt that they had lost<br />something intimate as they grew richer and more famous. It then<br />became nearly impossible to get tickets for the shows as they<br />would sell out in an instant. If you were lucky enough to get tickets,<br />the shows were generally uncomfortable and packed shoulder to<br />shoulder. I find it much harder to enjoy shows in that capicty.<br />Seeing them perform Meddle, Obscured By Clouds and Dark<br />Side of the Moon had a real magic that I have not experienced<br />since. People would actually sit and listen. Fantastic, wonderful,<br />creative music.
B002GYI9C4|4|Although superficially similar to Hunger Games (teenage female protagonist, Cinderella story, power struggle of the downtrodden, etc.) Mistborn provides a more character-driven story and relies less on the machinery behind the curtain to move the action forward.  It also spends less time in teenage-love-angst hand wringing and more time in character development.  Sanderson paints a believable, if not dire, landscape for our heroes and villains to struggle on.  The world mechanics and plot turns were interesting and clever enough to keep me turning pages until I was through.
B004X4QW42|5|This film is a fun throwback to the good ol' days of kung fu. I thouroughly enjoyed it.  I am not a movie critic just someone who wants to be entertained and this movie succeded
B0031KE9C6|5|Great!
B000002MX7|5|She is a true winner and a hit single &#34;I feel for You&#34; that is Solid Gold but, I'm a fan and I would recommend this to all ages especially everyone who missed it when it first came out in 1980's.
B00A81MV3U|5|This is a terrific movie on all levels.  The comments by the actors and director are worth watching and expands the enjoy and understanding the issues involved in the story.
B00005K3O4|4|I found this movie to be more funny than scary.  There was a few parts that were kinds creepy. <br /> <br />Definitely scary to anyone who already is afraid of clowns.
B00KPP6R9S|5|I love 24! This was the best season since the 6th season.
B006MW3UZW|5|I gave it 5 stars since I'm still hooked and I can't wait to find out what happens next season.
B00C1N9JWO|5|I am a fan of Nalini Singh and have read all of the books in this series.  I enjoyed this book, although it wasn't my favorite.  My all time favorite is still Slave to Sensation with Kiss of Snow and Play of Passion.
B000X5SPBI|4|This series is one of the few that I enjoy that my roommate likes...love the classic rock oldies in this series.
B008Y5N3O8|5|One of my favorite &#34;sales&#34; movies!  Wow there are a lot of &#34;eff-bombs&#34; in this flick.
B00N1JQ452|5|My 16 year old grand-daughter loved hers.
B00005B6N8|5|I ADORE scary movies (not hack-em ups) and Pitch Black is one of the best I've seen in a long time.  It takes advantage of most everyone's innate fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night.  To get the best effect, watch with the lights off!  It was a long time coming!
B009HUB40Y|4|I just wish there wasnt a time limit. I understand everything is gonna cost something to unlock it but every little thing these date want money money money
B009HQ9UHC|5|I Love Bad piggies its fun and challenging sometimes, and its Free Witch is all ways great! I totally recommend, Especially if you like angry birds.
B00G6NE53S|3|I almost didn't watch this season. Because, I hated what that hybrid bastard did to Stefan at the end of Season 2. He DID NOT have to blackmail Stefan into becoming a Ripper again to save Damon. I know why he did it, when he saw the life that Stefan had that he didn't have, he wanted to ruined it. Stefan had love, friendship & loyalty that he had earned. But \\"Reckoning\\" was hands-down the worst episode for me, when Klaus compelled Stefan to turn-off his humanity, I cried so damn hard. I wasn't a big fan of Damon during this season either, Stefan was forced to sacrifice everything to save his life...and, yet, here he is trying to steal the love of his life. NOT COOL. Damon didn't come to his senses until the \\"1912\\" episode, when he reminded Stefan that he tried to help him before he went off the edge, that scene was extremely touching, especially when Damon said to Stefan \\"You're all I got\\". I also liked when Stefan & Damon discovered that Alaric was killing people due to the effects of the Gilbert ring. There was some Damon's lines, that did crack me up:<br />The Hybrid: What's your big plan, Elena? You're going to walk through a campsite of werewolves, roast a marshmallow, and wait for Stefan to stop by?<br />Ghost World: I think you got your voodoo wires all crossed when you got rid of Vicki Donovan. Because, I'm pretty sure that I just got spit-roasted by Mason Lockwood's ghost. Maybe, because he chained me to a chair & shoved a hot poker in my chest. Let's just say I'm having deja-vu. I don't have time for vengeful Lockwood, when I kill someone, they're supposed to stay dead. Whatever you screwed up, fix it.<br />Break On Through: Just making sure that the witch didn't turn you into a toad or block of salt.

I cried because, Stefan told Elena in \\"Don't Go Gentle\\", that the reason he was acting out was because after bit Elena, he never wanted to feel anything again.

Since, we are possibly approaching what could be the Final Season of \\"The Vampire Diaries\\", I hope that Elena comes to her senses & chooses Stefan, just like she did in the \\"Season 4\\" opener. Because, Stefan has sacrificed so much...not just for Elena, but for Damon as well. Examples:<br /><br />Season 1 - Fool Me Once: Stefan sacrifices his freedom, when he hears Elena scream from inside the tomb; After everything Damon has done, Stefan begs him to leave the tomb with him, before they both end up being trapped.<br />Season 2 - Rose: Stefan apologizes to Damon, for forcing him to complete his transition.<br />Season 2 - The Sacrifice: Stefan once again sacrifices his freedom to save Jeremy, when Katherine tries to kill him.<br />Season 2 - The Dinner Party: He SAVES Damon (again!) when he learns that Damon will die, if he uses the dagger.<br />Season 2 - The Sun Also Rises: He OFFERS himself to be sacrificed to save Jenna's life...<br />Season 3: Ordinary People: He saves Damon (how many times has he done that now) when Mikael is about to rip out Damon's heart.<br /><br />Family is everything to Stefan, and that's who Elena should be with, someone who puts family before anything else.

B005HEW7JG|5|I went on line to buy my own DVDs of Voyager, because of the huge waiting list at my library for the various individual seasons, only to find I can get it streaming for free.  What a deal.<br /><br />As other reviewers have said, I enjoyed Voyager more than the other Star Trek progeny.  Species 8472 and the Borg.
B000Y0Q5NM|5|One of the, if not THE, best scifi show.
0307408868|5|Outstanding author! Brilliantly researched the time period and writes as if you are reading a novel of fiction--yet it'all true.
B00IINPXLW|5|Sweet
B005H9B2CE|4|Good story, great special effects, PG-13 rating because of the violence but there's no gore - thank goodness. The characters are a bit one dimensional but if you're looking for light entertainment, then this is a good pick.
0547258305|4|I loved this book- it is easily my favorite book in a long time. Honestly, words cannot express how I feel about this book. The characters are everything they should be; dynamic, original and extremely fun to follow. The stor begins with Katsa; who due to her Grace, is an extreme fighter - probably the best in all of the seven kingdoms. Her Uncle, a King, makes her do his bidding and therefore she is extremely feared throughout the kingdom. But Katsa doesn't want to be just a thug, so she begins the Council; a secret organization that helps people in need. When the book opens up Katsa is in the middle of one of the Council's missions to save an old Lienid man who has been kidnapped. This is where she meets the other main character, Prince Po, and the story takes off.<br /><br />Katsa is everything a heroine should be - she is a fierce warrior, has a kind heart and feels guilt. She develops so much throughout the story, she evolves into a woman in more ways than one over the course of the book. She starts out immensely lonely, with only a few friends. Most people are afraid of her Grace and cannot get past it. This creates a lot of sympathy for her character. I always find it amazing when I find myself reading a book about someone who does horrid things, and I am completely taken to the character. It is a sign of a terrific author when that happens; when I feel fiercely loyal to a character who begins the story as basically an assassin.<br /><br />I found the plot and pacing to be phenomenal. The book grabs hold of you in the first few pages and doesn't let up until the end. Katsa's story is a whirlwind of adventure, romance, loyalty and bravery. You cross forests, mountains and seas with her and encounter plenty of surprises along the way. The story is never short on plot twists, but they aren't those aggravating ones that I hate. I cannot exactly explain what I mean - but the plot twists fit in the story, they aren't outlandish and out of place. Do you know what I mean? Nothing is more irritating to me then something coming out of left-field that does not fit with the story or characters.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read the next book in the trilogy Fire, when I was halfway through with Graceling, I put Fire on hold at the library. I am desperate to know what happens to Katsa and Prince Po. If you haven't read this book, please go pick up a copy of Graceling. I was hesitant at first, because I was afraid of being let down. But I wasn't; I loved it more than I thought possible.mean?

B00BFUUMO8|5|I don't usually play SIM games. This is a lot of fun. It is a little slow at times, you have to wait for money to progress often. But, very fun!
0452282152|3|I liked this book, but after reading reviews and seeing it on the Best Seller's Lists, I was very surprised by it.  It was entertaining and somewhat informative, but frankly, it read like a grade school book. It took me less than two hours to begin and finish it, and I was even trying to ready slowly!  I don't know if I will be as willing to try another book by this author.
B008602KQI|4|It was a very good movie the directing was very well done the actors did a good job and the movie it's self was well done.
B0064TVQ5E|1|Would not load on my Kindle White as expected.  Loaded on my tablet - haven't had time to play it yet.
B00000612P|5|Rod Stewart made a few really good rock and roll albums, and Every Picture Tells a Story is the best of those albums. Rod made some solid albums before this but this was his strongest album to this point and really it was the strongest and most concistant of his whole carear. He never made an album better then this.<br />The Title track is maybe the hardest rocking song in Rods whole carear. Its got great vocals and amazing guitar by none other then Ronnie Wood of course. 'Seems Like A Long Time' and 'Thats Alright' are classic Stewart. 'Tomorrow Is A Long Time' isnt anything that special, its the only weak moment on Every Picture Tells A Story. 'Maggie Maye' Rods signature song, this is one of the greatest songs in rock histroy! 'Mandolin Wind' also is one of Rods best songs, and one of my personal favorites, and noone can play the mandolin like old Ronnie Wood! '(I Know) I'm Losing You' is one of Rod Stewarts best songs, and definatly his best cover song by far! 'Find A Reason To Beleave' is the perfect song to close the album as it to was one of Rods biggest and best songs!<br />This is one of the three essential-must own album by Rod Stewart, he and Ronnie Wood never sounded better together, except when they played with Jeff Beck!
B004SJ3BCI|1|I really like Angry Birds the game. But I could not stand the suggestive and violent ads that kept popping up on this free version of the game. I had to delete it for that reason and until I can find a free version without vulger popups, I'll just play the many Free versions on my computer.
B00AH3DCAA|5|Just like my Rolex, but only more affordable with the same quality and reliability.
B00CNQ7CRI|3|Definitely not like the first but it was good to see a sequel and enjoy meeting Bridget Jones again. Mark Darcy, who reminds me of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, stands up for his great qualities. A good weekend reading. Fun to see women having their Toy Boys, the equivalent of men's bimbos.
0898451299|5|I grew up with this book and it always remained as a special memory for me. I was ecstatic to order it for my daughter. Without any prompting from me, it has become her favourite book and she loves the reality of the stories as well as the colourful characters. If you want a great book for your young kids to enjoy for years. This is the one. Enjoy !
B007VUA7VO|5|Its awsome you need to get it.come on now buy it 8iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii love it it it it iy it it it
B004XJRQUQ|5|Best best book ever! I loved every page! It's like no other story I've read! Makes me want to learn how to survive the outdoors!
B008GJV19Q|4|I enjoyed the movie.  It was a nice story and I enjoyed the characters.  Judy Dench was wonderful as usual.  It wasn't what I had expected, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I would recommend it when you want to see something light with a little twist on things.  I don't want to give away anything about the story line,  Its a little like a love story with some magic twists on things. It goes to show that many times, things are not as they first appear.
B000FC2L1E|2|I skipped a lot of pages throughout the book, it was really hard to pay attention - I kept hoping the story would pick up..it finally did about halfway through- still not what I expected overall pretty boring. Read it before bed it'll put you to sleep.
B000QRIGLC|5|Amazing! Thank you Marcus for sharing your story. Thank you to those who sacrificed everything on that mountain and thank you to all those who fight, have fought, and will fight for our great nation. This is by far, the best book I've ever read. The &#34;never quit&#34;, &#34;you're never out of the fight&#34; attitude has changed my life! Thank you, thank you, thank you, and God Bless!
B0041KKYBA|5|This film is brilliantly narrated by Matt Damon, and spells out exactly what happened to bring us to our knees economically.  The information comes at you so fast that you really need to watch it at least twice to fully appreciate it.
1419707663|5|I purchased this gift set for my grand daughter for Christmas. She's read all the other &#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34; books and really was excited to get these to add to her collection. She enjoys sharing the stories with me and I love that she does.
B00BHU261S|3|Didn't realize that the movie was primarily about the making of Psycho. Expected more about Hitchcock himself. But what they did was good.
B00881VLCE|5|this is a very relaxing game I enjoy that you can choose how many Leicester you want to play with and if you want to rotate pieces or not. I love doing puzzles and this sure beats having to find missing puzzle pieces
B00005QZWJ|5|This musical score is brilliant. The songs are beyond words. The moods swing from cheerful and bright to dark and haunting. I get chills every time I listen to this. Howard Shore is a great composer who really captured the music of Middle-earth. Enya's songs really add a wonderful Elvish lilt to some of the songs, especially the last one, which has me teared up every time. Although I love all of the songs, I have to say my favorite is &quot;The Bridge of Khazhad-dum&quot; The deep bass with the low voices over it wonderfully portray the danger and adrenaline that is happening in that particular scene. When the music stops- WoW! You can get very caught up in the emotions of the music. I can't wait until the soundtrack for The Two Towers comes out. I can go on and on, but I won't bore you. So, as the Elves say,<BR> Namarie! ( Farewell)
B00932AA5G|3|The movie starts out strong, with lots of quick scenes of sophisticated Oslo and rapid dialogue.  The suspense builds quickly.  But then it turns into a cat and mouse game that has two problems: 1. The cat's motivation for pursing the mouse was never clear, and 2. As is too typical in movies like this, the mouse got out of too many perilous situations to be believable.  It could have been more interesting if it turned into a psychological and intellectual thriller instead.
B00NGYBMOK|5|Quick and easy
B00005N9CV|4|I'm a big Diana Krall fan.  I have all her previous stuff.  She's a great pianist and a great singer.  But with this album she lets the orchestra dominate and lead her around.  Understanable for a first try.  But next time she records with an orchestra I hope she keep those chops out in front.  She need to think like Sinatra did -- you're the lead singer and piano player, the orchestra is there to back her up.  Nice foray into vocal music, but more pop than jazz.
030758836X|4|This book was nuts. I'm going to do my best to discuss it without spoilers.<br /><br />\\"Amy didn't care to know my family, didn't want to know my birthplace, and yet for some reason, I thought moving home would be a good idea.\\"<br /><br />This was the point at which I knew things were amiss. What sort of spouse doesn't want to know about your family, your background? All was obviously not how it seemed in Nick and Amy's marriage. But who, if anyone, was telling the truth?<br /><br />The book is very well constructed, so much so that you can completely buy into the improbable circumstances. Because I was late to this particular party, I knew there was a giant twist. So when it came, I wasn't surprised by its existence, but neither was I surprised by its content. I didn't guess it, exactly, but it made sense to me. It almost had to be that way, in order for the story to continue.<br /><br />Don't expect to be able to root for either Nick or Amy. One's evil, the other's a weak whiner, and they're probably both sociopaths. And that's perfectly alright with me.<br /><br />There are actions and reactions in the final act of the book that didn't make a lot of sense to me, and were actually somewhat disappointing. That's why I have to dock it a star. But if you like dark psychological thrillers, with characters you can't quite like, then Gillian Flynn is definitely your girl.
B006OAB3ME|3|First of all, I love the Beatles and Paul McCartney. That being said this is the first Paul record that I haven't purchased in years(with the exception of instrumentals, etc). I just can't bring myself into buying it. I mean I work really hard for my money and a lot of it is just average nastalgia type of music. I will check it out from the library. Same goes for Ringo. Their time has passed.
B003JTHXOK|4|SAFE HAVEN is an adventure. Only a small part of the book slows down, but just for a bit. You'll find this book another hard to put away event.
B0036V4DGC|5|What can I say, It's the Alan Parsons Project.  What a venue.  It Must have been amazing to be there.
B00E8KLWB4|5|I like these games and this particular one has a nice place and artwork
B00881VLCE|5|Provides the puzzle without the mess
B00M4ADWQ8|5|Good! Not great. I would have enjoyed this more as a kid. At age 43, not so much lol
B000BZ9DKW|5|I own this and the movie is extremly funny. It is tasteful and approrpriate for most ages however you really need to be an office worker (IT position helps great) to truly appreciate the movie. That being said, anyone can potentially find it funny but as a resident IT guy in a cubicle I love this movie!
B004ZRV3AU|5|Using the included directions I never got a good cut, but when I used the flame/ice method, it worked great!  I use one of those little gel fuel containers used to keep buffet food warm, and then ice and bottles separate so quick and mostly usable!
B005GY0Y8S|2|Good
B00LP9E79U|4|Good Rainy day movie.  3.5 stars
B009HUB40Y|2|I deleted this game after only two minutes of play. Too many ads, slow moving, and I did not like how the length of the games were set. I also object to the name of the game - the developers could have been more sensitive in naming this game.
B00170MYIS|5|This is the perfect replacement battery ....
B000JMKNJ2|4|I thought this was a book about thieves but really its more about con artists rather than thieves. I'm not really into to con artist stories but it was still a good read.
B009WO7NQO|5|great combo of space and birds. I am really enjoying this. price is high but worth it. keep up the good work!!
B0063GORYU|5|Delighted with the spider app. Aids with developing concentration skills, strategy ,focus and is oddly meditative. I can spend hours at this game while sorting out the rest of life's mysteries.
B004EBT5CU|5|I love this cd.  Adele has an incredibly strong and powerful voice. The absolute best voice I have heard in a long long time. If you love a truely beautiful voice, singing fantastic music,look no further.  You won't be sorry.
B002RV01Q8|5|To all Enya fans ,this is a very worthwhile addition to your collection, it also gives you a little history on Enya and her writers etc; all in all a very nicely put together DVD, well worth the money.
B00I2WNYJW|5|this book gives you a complete understanding of the economics, politics and history of modern civilization. as dry as that sounds it is fascinating  and eye opening. i do not believe you can consider yourself well educated unless you have read it.
B00632HWOG|2|Sorry to say, but I do not like the app.  Have it installed on my new kindle 8.9.  The theme is not clear. you can not hardly even make out the picture.  Have it on other tabs and works just fine, except the theme keeps on going and have to reset it.
B007ZXK08C|4|Good read. Unusual and engrossing.
B004PZ4HC8|5|book was great and came to me in great condition. this is one of my favorites for this past months read
B00992CF6W|1|Updates arebvery slow to come out. Only a fraction of the functionality of minecraft is available. The last update made my game unplayable. Every time I getnclose tona structurei have built the game freezes which in turn freezes up my whole tablet.
B00HXEWECI|3|This movie started off really good....I enjoyed the special effects.  I was enjoying the movie for quite a while but the last hour of the movie gets really over the top in dumbness.  This movie should be a hour shorter and it would be at least a four star.  It was worth the $8 though.
B00005R62N|5|From the Japanese audience's eager singalong on the very first song on this album (\\"Fall to your knees and repent if you please!\\"), it's clear that this early incarnation of legendary metal group Judas Priest knew how to work a crowd. The band appears onstage at Kaseinenkin Hall on the cover in full black leather and studs regalia, surrounded by bright lights and billowing smoke. Upon release, the album established Priest as one of the metal's live heavyweights and also comes in handy as an unofficial \\"best of\\" 1970s Judas Priest--containing most of their early hit songs.<br /><br />A lot of these songs aren't played live anymore, which is a shame because Priest's early work was much more fiery and raw than their 80s output. The live versions crackle with gentle reverb, and the guitar solos especially are given new life in this sweaty, packed early live setting.<br /><br />\\"Stand up for Exciter!\\" vocalist Rob halford orders the Japanese in the namesake opener. The echo from the guitar intro to \\"Diamonds and Rust\\" fills the theater. \\"Sinner,\\" \\"Delivering the Goods,\\" and \\"The Green Manalishi\\" carry the night with simple but authoritative riffing.<br /><br />But the most well-known highlight here is Halford's stunning vocal prowess on \\"Victim of Changes,\\" turning an already excellent song into a true epic. About halfway through the track, the band settles into a subtle breakdown, with only drummer Les Binks hammering away at a midtempo--the calm before the storm, as it were.<br /><br />Halford leads the finale starting in a low baritone before building all the way up to an inhuman shriek several octaves up: \\"Victim of Changes!!!\\" The audience at the time can be pictured looking at one another in astonishment and asking, \\"Did he really just do that?\\" I know I did! The inclusion of \\"Hell Bent For Leather\\" is a fitting encore, a terrific wail of a song that stands as one of the band's most classic moments, live or otherwise.<br /><br />\\"Unleashed In the East\\" hearkens back to an earlier time, when Judas Priest was poised for true liftoff into \\"legend\\" status...back before they were filling arenas and stadiums, Priest was a hungry, passionate band playing to small crowds of only a few hundred to a thousand. This album takes you back to those early days.<br /><br />It could be the best live metal album ever released.<br /><br />Rob Halford<br />Glenn Tipton<br />KK Downing<br />Ian Hill<br />Les Binksk to an earlier time, when Judas Priest was poised for true liftoff into \\"legend\\" status...back before they were filling arenas and stadiums, Priest was a hungry, passionate band playing to small crowds of only a few hundred to a thousand.

B00000DHTF|3|Bruce Springsteen was heralded as the &quot;new&quot; Bob Dylan when he arrived on the scene in the 70's.  His recent release underscores the fact that although he is an outstanding songwriter, he is no Bob Dylan.  Tracks  begs to be compared to Dylan's Bootleg Series Vol 1-3 and it comes up on  the short end. Bruce has released capable outtakes that rightfully so never  ended up on his albums.  Rarely do you say to yourself, &quot;Why didn't  that make the album?&quot; as you do constantly with the Dylan set.  Listen  to Dylan's &quot;Let Me Die in My Footsteps&quot; or &quot;Moonshiner&quot;  or &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; and tell me there's one Bruce track even  in the ballpark.  Good work, yes, but hidden masterpieces, hardly.
B007IXWKUK|5|This book was actually better the first book.  I can't wait to get started on Book Three! Five stars for Book Two.
B00KGL7Y6Q|5|This is one of the best WWII series made.
B001TH16DI|1|I think only the beginning where it shows the theater movie clip of Star Trek (2009) is in Blu Ray. I am very disappointed and feel ripped off . I have Star IV on DVD and with this set on Blu Ray (supposedly) and I can not see lick of difference in the DVD and the BLU Ray. I have a Samsung HDtv 240 hz  and it is 1080 either I or P.....My surround system is the top of the line Yamaha.And it is sat up correctly. So I am very highly disappointed in who did these.... And does Amazon exactly paid attention to these? One more thing, i read a bunch of the reviews and  people tried to warn people this was a rip off.  So I have no one to blame except myself unless Amazon does something.
B0058UXHHK|5|This one kept me guessing most of the way through it, although the main character seemed a bit annoying at first. Definitely worth a read.
B00EEDJHXA|5|It is easy, yet challenging.  It's fun, yet frustrating too.  When you are on a roll and zooming through these, you get that one puzzle that is very hard to solve.  I just leave it for a while then get back to it.  You really need to have this app.
B00DR0PDNE|1|Was not compatible wiht my router settings.  I did not feel the desire to rip open my router settings and revise my permissions and firewalls.  Not for something i expected to be plug n' play.
B008OHV5QO|1|This video is all about taking a ride in a classic car (nice car!) around Neil Young's hometown.  In the beginning as he is talking about what it was like growing up, he makes a statement about blowing up a turtle by sticking a firecracker up its backside, adding a comment suggesting that this was normal for young boys to do.  Neil--this is NOT NORMAL!  It is horrendous and you should be ashamed!
B008OOYALE|5|I love this game ot is the best it is just like dragonvale and better if you like dragonvale get dragonstory and compare.
B00DJFIMW6|5|it is a really good game and it is age adjustable which is great because it gets harder depending on your age
B00VFTCGES|4|You better be tuned in right from the git go on this one!  Lots to think about and imagine in multidimensional world!
1451673442|5|During the last two years, I've been through the darkest time of my entire life. When a person gets that low, and others say, \\"Just count your blessings\\", you want to slap them, because you cannot mentally get there. This book is truly magic, because the author gives you the tools and steps to  begin counting your blessings in a way that is doable. Not only that, I have seen magical transformations in my life. The day after I did the first money exercise, two unexpected checks totaling more than $100 showed up in the mail.<br /><br />A word of caution: because these steps really work, sometimes you go through what I call a \\"detoxification\\" process. On some of the steps that you are really struggling with, you can actually feel worse afterward. This is simply the old negative programming escaping your body and senses. Its a good idea to just do days One and Two for a day or two after this just to regroup, then you can proceed.<br /><br />And don't give up. Right about day eight, my dad passed away from colon cancer. I was with him, and it was so hard to see him go through a tough and terrible time at the end. I loved my dad so much; he was my rod and support. When Mom died, I mourned for years. As Dad passed, I used The Magic steps as I worked through my loss. The difference has been miraculous. I  miss him every day, but I do not feel the excruciating pain in my heart that I did in the beginning. I am coping with many of the difficult things in life so much better.  I can tell the days I miss my gratitude lists. The sweet peace they bring is obviously absent.<br /><br />The Magic is an inspired book.
B001GXF2YY|5|Great read.  I'm familiar with the area that the story takes place so, for me it was like I was there.  Very well written.  When you get to the middle that's when it really grabs you.  Really enjoyed it
B00CW665VI|5|First off let me say well done Miss Chase!! I absolutely love the man's point of view!! Drew was hilarious and I love his Witt and charm... I will tell all my friends this is a great book and they should definitely read it!!! Waiting for the next book you have in store for us:)
B009YG2ND8|5|ive always enjoyed this series growing up and im glad to see an updated version of it... ahhhh the memories
0670026603|5|It's been a while since I've read a book that makes just sob while reading it, and this book definitely did that at a few points. Yet at other times, I was reading it and laughing out loud. I loved this book and how they author undertook such a serious subject matter and really seemed to flesh it out, at least for me. By the end, I felt so connected with the main characters and loved the other details that unfolded with the secondary characters. The only complaint I have is that I found the relationship between Louisa and her boyfriend contrived from the get go, but it's a small part of a much grander story. I definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a moving read that will touch on your ethical beliefs and outlook on life.
0425263924|5|I made the mistake of reading some reviews before starting this book, and expected to be disappointed after so many negative comments. Obviously, reading is subjective and we're all going to take something different from a book, but once I started reading, I realized this was a perfect installment to the Crossfire series, and I'm really pleased that Sylvia is continuing with the story. She's created a whole cast of truly powerful yet flawed characters, and in the first three books she's allowed us to see their growth, their setbacks, and the growing understanding of their conflicted relationships. I'm loving every page, and definitely looking forward to the next in the series.

B0007GAEW6|2|So, every critic and hipster has been wetting themselves since the Mars Volta burst on the scene in the wake of At The Drive In. To put it quite frankly, this CD is overrated. I wasn't floored my De-Loused but both that and this CD are novel, very original, and somewhat compelling albums. Now, if I was to rate this CD on the basis of composition, scope, depth, magnitude, and originality, by all means it would be a 5. But, as far as listenability and songs sticking in your head...no. First of all, nearly every song has 230981 minutes of dead space quirky noises like Omar's solo CD. They didn't even have time to put Frances The Mute, the title track on the album because it clocks in at 77 minutes. How bout drop half the beep boop noises and throw a real track on? Thanx, MV, thanx. Track 1 is so frantic and hyper its pretty much unlistenable in my opinion. The Widow has a few cool melodies but half the track is again wasted. L'Via L'Viaquez is hands down the best song on the CD with its Latin percussion and mostly Spanish vocals, amazing. Track 4 is also really good, well, just track 4, not the accomponing parts of the track. And the last one is good if you have a long drive or like to get high I'm told...about 30 minutes long, maybe good to listen to once a month. So all in all, this CD is 2 1/2 to 3 stars in my opinion. Definately groundbreaking and more original than whats out there now, just slightly less memorable. Then again, I was never the biggest fan of At The Drive In...
B0089EHWQE|5|Loved this book so much! Fell so hard for Will and Lou that my fingertips ached. Although I hoped for another ending, it might just not have been right.<br /><br />Oh man....I'll just be over there in the corner crying a little bit more.
B008MG1E4A|5|Once I started reading it -- I found it hard to put down. The writer shared the credit and made sure the reader understood it was a team effort.
B00594XOZU|5|The fastest texting app I have ever been on and unlocked me other apps it has cool stickers and AWESOME updates!
B005LAIIMG|3|When I read in several publications this movie was in production and starred Brad Pitt I thought &#34; At Last &#34; a high budget horror movie.<br />While the storyline and acting are good it fell way short of my expectations for one reason ...  it's a PG-13 movie.<br />Zombie movies are a unique genre of horror in that they need to be rated R in order to convey the real horror and fear by graphic depictions of people being bit and then changing into a zombie and finally graphically depicting the killing of a zombie.<br />All of the ingredients missing in this movie which frankly left me yawning.<br />If you have not seen this movie and are thinking of purchasing it I highly recommend you rent it first lest you be disappointed and out of twenty dollars for your DVD purchase.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Best movie we have seen so far. My daughter has digital copy on her kindle and has it playing constantly!
B00CM9JKQM|3|I like it.<br />Todd La Torre has the pipes to fit this attempt to play in the style of OLD QR.<br />Some pretty solid songs too.<br />Just not an Empire or Revoloution type release.
B00900NAFI|4|many newer words are missing, but it helps with older texts

B0081JPTCQ|5|I've used Handy Note on my KindleFire for a week now, and I love it.  There are a few very minor things that I would tweak, but nothing that keeps things from running smoothly.  The app is fast replacing the disorganized stack of papers I usually carry around.  I can copy text I need for a meeting from emails or other files, paste into a notebook, edit, bring my tablet to the meeting, then take notes at the meeting, and it is all neatly kept and readily retrievable.  Notes can be typed or handwritten using a finger or stylus, which is nice, since I hate virtual keyboards. There are various templates available for setting up pages which are well conceived and useful.  I have my Kindle with me all the time, so it's easy to keep up with tasks, meeting minutes, journal writing, etc. where ever I am.  Highly recommended!
B0009VSB06|5|Christmas gift.
B00IMYVCEY|5|Awesome movies with fantastic quality!
B0090SI3EI|5|Had to purchase this for my grandson who comes over often and loves Captain America
B00C1LIYWM|5|this movie stayed very close to the book and was very interesting kept you watching for all the details really like Nichols Sparks books
B004EBZX6W|5|This is a wonderful app!  it helped me determine that my neighbors we're broadcasting on the same wifi channel that I was.
0811879542|5|This book is super simple. You could almost make your own. But my 23 months old daughter simple loves it. We bought it for a plane ride and it worked magic. She has been reading it every night for the past 2 weeks.
193413712X|4|I chose this book for an English project and I admit it was rather a rushed decision (I had about a 1 1/2 months to read it, write up a summary, and make a 7 minute presentation). However, it was a lot better than I thought it would be.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who finds interest in inspirational books. The entire book was basically a giant quote about life and death. It is a tad slow paced, however, if you find the true meaning behind the book, I guarantee you'll enjoy it.
B001R0KH3W|5|Excellent. Stevie at his best.
B0032CVAQQ|5|Great Book that is practical and easy to read.  A lot of great information in here.  Highly Recommend for any married couple (I'm newly married)
B005HI7NP0|5|I read reviews all the time before I make a purchase, but rarely write them.  This has to be one of THE BEST CD's I had never heard of before.  It appeared as a suggested purchase when I bought another CD.  I went to bed the first night I downloaded the MP3 version with it playing on my Kindle and in my ear in my iTunes.  Since I couldn't crank up the music loud enough on my Kindle, I went to the same song on my iPod, and danced in my bed until I wore myself out and fell back to sleep.<br /><br />DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS CD.  Get it now!
B00HDMMISA|5|Very interesting story. I like multiple story lines running together. I fell in love with the characters and thought they were developed well. The shenanigans between the parents were very amusing and unfortunately very common these days. I loved it and would highly recommend it!!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Does everything advertised and more. Easy to install and use. I have no techno savy but had no problem installing
B008Y7WYVY|5|Very cool! Batman gets messed with a little more in this one. But he still fights back! Danny DeVito was very good playing the Penguin. Nothing I can say other than awesome!
B00R2Z32PQ|5|This movie was better than I expected! Action-packed from start to finish. Great for the whole family to watch!
B000ID1J0E|5|I'm just seeing this move for the first time. And I am hooked!! Johnny Depp is a fool! OMG! cracked up the entire movie! Excellent!!!
B003F3FJQO|5|I loved it recommend it to 13+ five star fantastic action packed futuristic best book of the year page turner
B000JML7YC|4|This book is free to download in amazon kindle store. I am happy to own it.
B00003CXZ4|5|Everyone who rated this less than 4 stars was too dumb to figure out what was going on, so this movie requires at least a certain amount of intelligence.  <br />The masterfull editing is what makes this film really shine.  As most have already guessed, it's done so that the film is backwards.  Why?  So the viewer has the same short term memmory problem the main character does.  He doesn't know why he's in a strange looking motel, and neither does the view.  See?  It makes sense.  Fantastic film, the ending is the best too.
B00KA7JIII|4|Super fun addicting game that really gets your mind going. I thought it was an awesome game but there were only ten levels ao I finished it pretty quickly. Definitely worth the play, I just wish they would release more levels
B00008PX8P|5|Quite simply, this DVD set is Amazing!! I have never been a huge fan of \\"live\\" music but have always been a HUGE fan of Led Zeppelin (since the 70's!!). I swear it did not take 2 seconds into the first DVD to realize this was fantastic!! (And what I had missed by not watching them \\"live\\" before now!!) Led Zeppelin's performances are so awesome that it literally takes you THERE. Detail & clarity are fantastic! I LOVE this and HIGHLY recommend it! Don't miss out on this awesome experience!!
B00EMXBDMA|5|Loved this book.  I really liked the way it was written
B007PT3QOQ|5|I am finding no problem with the game what so ever. The animations are great. Yes, it takes awhile for the energies to build up, but then what do you expect? Most of the games you play on Facebook take energies in some way, shape,  or form. Sit back,  relax and enjoy the game. It was free for crying out loud!
B001HM1PFO|5|Classic movies that stands the test of time. Had me laughing and singing at all the right moments. I may be drunk posting this at the same time.
B00DR0PDNE|4|When it's working 85% of the time, I love it. It's small, its convenient/transferable, and its easy. It's a bit buggy, however. Sometimes it will cause the TV to turn on at random, other times the TV will refuse to recognize it. I find that if I unplug and replug all the Chromecast parts, it reboots and works again, but that is not a given. You will need to have an updated OS on at least one of your devices to download the Chromecast app and get this started. But once it is set up, you can watch/listen to Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, etc, from any device.<br /><br />I do wish there was a quick way to stream from Amazon. I don't see the point in buying a separate device for Amazon streams. I see online that there is a possible work around but haven't tried it yet.
B002QE3CTY|5|I like this book because it is awesome and intense I live violent books and movies the movie is amazing also I don't like when chuck dies in the book😿but other than that I loved it👍I would recommend this book to all my friends and I gave it this rating because it is amazing
B00IFMHZ58|4|If you like the series, you will enjoy the movie because it is very much a continuation.  I am a big fan and long for a few more seasons of the TV show, especially since they still have the quality writing of old.  It never should have been cancelled in my view.
B00180R06I|5|Carl Dreyer's 'Vampyr' is a testament to the way in which cinema has basically lost its' intangible capacity to cut across our our most banal expectations. This brief film is a tour-de-force of technical virtuosity-I particularly like the shots from inside the coffin. Of course, no one today is going to appreciate this little beauty for its horror-after all there's no 'camp' or shock value, merely the subtle accumulation of shadow and subtle eroticism. There are also truly revolutionary transgressions of point of view and continuity which render this masterpiece an eternally perplexing and interesting visual accomplishment.
B003B02O7I|5|this was the most touching and interesting book. The story of people with the money to have a great life but squandered it selfishly abusing their bodies and their lives and hurting others.  Then you have a person like Rachel who gives so unselfishly to others.  Nate who overcame a terrible addiction and learned from the experience and turned his eyes and heart upwards.  Wow,I don't know when I have enjoyed a book so much.  I have always enjoyed his books, but this was his best as far as I am concerned.  Thank you so much for the adventure and beautiful story.
B00IEBE7GK|5|Surpasses The Room (1).<br />Great graphics and puzzles. When Fireproof makes another I'll get it without hesitation.
B00005JKHP|4|Off the top of my head, I can think of no other production in science fiction film that has engendered so much controversy over so long a period of time than &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;.<br />Most Trek fans either grudgingly accept the film's presence, or outright despise it with such rancor that its a wonder the film is still in circulation in any form, let alone a new DVD.<br />Few fans can look past the expansive, sprawling, epic-like quality of the film, so unlike the original series in tone, pace, and styling. The metaphysical attributes of ST:TMP conjure up images of the rival series &quot;Space:1999&quot;, which to this day many Trek fans still love to hate.<br />Personally, I've always leaned more towards &quot;2001&quot; style sci-fi than the mindless action-fests that litter the genre today, so even as a Trek fan, I can more easily accept ST:TMP than perhaps some of my fellow Trekkers can. I'd be lying if I said ST:TMP was my favorite Trek, or even an understandable one. But I've always kind of liked it, flaws and all. The film is firmly rooted in the mid-70's, and even the name &quot;The Motion Picture&quot; brings to mind a grand, sprawling epic like &quot;2001&quot;.<br />The &quot;2001&quot;-effect is in full force in ST:TMP, especially in the opening sequence when Kirk is shuttling over from the space dock, and we first get to see the new Enterprise. The &quot;2001&quot; spacecraft ballet sequences were obviously an inspiration for this part of ST:TMP.<br />The attitudes about sex, especially where the Deltan, Ilia, is concerned, are also a bit dated. Most of her lines about other races being &quot;sexually inferior species,&quot; etc., have been cut in the new release.<br />The DVD, however, is not really all that special. While most of the newly added effects scenes are seamless, there are one or two points where the CGI Enterprise looks like a graphic from a videogame.<br />Best fix would have to be the moment when Enterprise leaves the drydock. The black armature rig that was attached to the secondary hull always bugged me in that sequence (used again in STII:TWOK), at it was seamlessly removed in this new version. Worst is the land bridge forming when the crew exits the ship to go see V'ger (the CGI Enterprise is obviously fake here, but still better than the lousy matte paintings used in 1979). We also get to see at long last what the V'ger ship really looks like.<br />The extras are a mixed bag. There are three documentaries that reveal little or nothing new, and in true Paramount fashion, are part infomercial for Trek merchandise. We only get to see snippets of the screen tests of Xon and Phase II, when we could have seen them in full. At least the trims and cut scenes from both the 1979 theatrical version and the 1983 TV version are present on Disc 2.<br />Best surprise? The original TV spots, being narrated by none other than Mr. Orson Welles! And they're sooooo seventies-looking, too!<br />As for the recut by Robert Wise, most of it makes sense. The film is tighter than ever, and plays better. Still, there were moments that shouldn't have been cut, or ones I just plain miss.<br />Case in point, when V'ger attacks the Enterprise. Sulu says, &quot;The new screens held!&quot; This always made sense to me, since we had a new starship with new tech, so new-style defectors were a natural. But this crucial bit was snipped in the recut, so now it doesn't make sense when the Klingons and the Epsilon Array are wiped out, but not the Enterprise.<br />Sulu fares the worst in other missing scenes, mostly to remove some of the moments with of Ilia. The nervous, fumbling Sulu showing Ilia the control system is gone, as is the moment when Kirk takes Decker off the bridge and Sulu asks a distracted Ilia to confirm a control setting. Sulu fans are bound to be a bit unhappy at the cuts.<br />Maybe the scenes make more sense to a Trek fan than to a great, (but non-Trek), director like the legendary Wise. Ormaybe it's just nostalgia on my part, having heard the dialogue so often over the years that I expect Sulu to say &quot;The new screens held,&quot; or for Kirk to repeat his command, &quot;Viewer off!&quot;<br />In the end, although I like the overall fix and updated effects, I find myself longing a bit for the 1983 version, even though I had to fast-forward through the endless fly-over of V'ger. In my opinion, the recut is both a great achievement that was a long time in coming, and its also a bit of a disappointment.<br />When all is said and done, the new recut is bound to keep alive the one thing about ST:TMP that has always been consistant... controversy.r maybe it's just nostalgia on my part, having heard the dialogue so often over the years that I expect Sulu to say &quot;The new screens held,&quot; or for Kirk to repeat his command, &quot;Viewer off!&quot;<br />In the end, although I like the overall fix and updated effects, I find myself longing a bit for the 1983 version, even though I had to fast-forward through the endless fly-over of V'ger.

B00K2QKM3C|4|Whatever they did to this movie in preparation for rerelease, it looks terrific.
B001NLKWLW|4|Perfect novel for an easy summer read.  Not going to stand the literary world on its head, but it has enough substance for a good discussion for a book club.  Plus room for fluff:  we argued about which actors should be cast for the major parts in the movie.<br /><br />Since the author (or perhaps she would prefer being called &#34;the authoress?&#34;) bases so many things in her novels on real-life incidents, it made us wonder about the state of her marriage (the novel didn't seem to have many, if any, that could be considered happy or &#34;normal,&#34; whatever that is) and whether or not she had a good mother or is, herself, a good mother (wow . . . the novel did a number on Moms, that's for sure).<br /><br />Easy to read, holds your attention, fun to discuss.
B007ZGO7EM|5|its really really easy to use and straight to the point. awesome calculator. would definitely recommend it to everyone. its great!
B00008WT5M|4|Money Talks is one of my favorite songs.  I love the way it jams and I can have the kids listen to it and they love it.  Need to be careful with other AC/DC songs. Money talks makes a great ringtone  If there were 1 or 2 more songs I liked on this I would give it a 5 star<br /> I bought  3 AC/CD CD's to get the songs I wanted -  Money Talks is the only one I really wanted from this one.  They don't do Amazon individual songs or greatest hits.<br />AC/DC Favorites<br />Money Talks<br />TNT<br />Dirty Deeds<br />Long Way to the Top if you want to Rock and Roll - Love the Bag Pipes!!<br />I'll try to listen to some others later to find some I like.  I don't like the more vulgar songs.

B003D81NVQ|5|This was a great program.
B00QLVY7J2|5|Very Addictive
B004J4WKTW|3|Rather weird.  In fairness, I tired of reading it before I was half-way through it, so perhaps it improved in the second half.  Also, I don't recall any sex or violence in the first half but don't know about the latter half.
B000W745CU|5|The product was exactly what I was looking for and came just as described. It was a gift for a Harry Potter fan. They loved it. So happy it is FULL SCREEN and not wide screen.
B000059T00|5|Great Album.  Was a great album in the day.  Now I have a version that I can listen to on modern technology.  It was great to see Winwood and Clapton tour a few years ago when they did sort of a Blind Faith reunion.
B009A87Z6U|4|Gift for my husband.  He was thrilled to get this.
B008JGSM6G|5|I Love this game, I have to use the letters because im color blind but makes it alot easy for me, good exersises for the brain
B00000DC4A|5|After the good-but-not-great, overproduced syntho- pop of 18 &quot;til I  Die, this excellent effort  emphasizes   melody and playability over  slickness. The first three tracks are very strong and there are only 2 real  losers here, If I Had You and I,m A  Liar. Getaway and Before The Night Is  Over are the standouts on a very satisfying CD. Nice job, Bryan
B00QH21JZK|5|Must have if you're a Judas Priest fan.
0151013047|4|I have to confess - I found the hushed stillness of fiction in the aftermath of 9/11 almost as daunting as the very sight of the falling towers. For a time, I was almost expecting some latter-day prophet to show up and proclaim, Adorno-style, that literature after Ground Zero is barbaric as well. It is of great relief, therefore, to see 9/11 being increasingly addressed now beyond the sporadic short story and pitched in longer, more substantial narratives. Novels that take on September 11 trickle in at a steady pace. We have seen, in the past few months, the publication of Helen Schulman's A Day at the Beach and Don De Lillo's exquisite prose in Falling Man. The latest fictional take on the infamous attacks is Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist, a short but intense novella that made it to the Man Booker Prize 2007 shortlist.       Hamid's second work (his first novel was Moth Smoke) is a dramatic monologue that discloses the story of Changez, a Pakistani university lecturer who gives an impassioned account of his days as a promising analyst at an eminent New-York based financial audit firm. The setting for his tale is as spartan as his situation at the time of narration: he sits at a popular eating-place in a crowded Lahore bazaar and feeds his story into a wraithlike American listener. `I stared', Changez tells him bluntly, `as one - and then the other - of the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center collapsed. And then I smiled. Yes, despicable as it may sound, my initial reaction was to be remarkably pleased.'      It certainly is a daring statement for a young, ambitious Princeton graduate making a lucrative living in a corporate headquarters that boasts luxury bird's-eye views of Manhattan. But then, his entire account is self-consciously provocative, as he outlines his ambivalent affinity with America. It is the tale of a budding financial adviser hopelessly in love with Erica, an upper-middle class `regal' beauty from New York. Through her constant aura of detachment and eventual descent into psychological disorder, Changez's sweetheart may well hint at that America against whom Changez develops his multiple and contradictory identities. The young employee makes a name as a rigorous analyst, unforgiving in his science, goal-oriented -a corporate recruiter's dream come true. Things take a fateful twist on his business trip to Valparaiso, where Changez becomes aware of himself as a `janissary'. Drawing on the analogy with the young Christian hostages successfully trained as fierce Muslim fighters, he awakens to his situation as a US-trained agent operating for an exploitative US company against the interests of his homeland. This epiphanic trip brings his American career to an end and sees him boarding a plane back to Pakistan. Throughout his tale, Changez brings out many of the nuances that characterize the life of a visa-carrying Pakistani residing in post-9/11 America. `[I]t is hateful to hear another person gloat over one's country's misfortune', he tells his listener. `But surely you cannot be completely innocent of such feelings yourself'. Do you feel no joy at the video clips - so prevalent these days - of American munitions laying waste the structures of your enemies?'      9/11, therefore, provokes the demise of the \\"American\\" Changez, and 9/11, even, heightens his awareness of the other scenario that unfolded while millions around the world were glued to CNN's Breaking News. Pakistan's stand-off with India, back then, was set to escalate into a full-blown nuclear confrontation, and this facet of events becomes the catalyst of Changez's conversion. It was in America's interest, he remarks, to carpet-bomb Afghanistan and then stand back as India flexed its muscles at his homeland. As a consequence, Changez mutates vertiginously, from the gifted US-trained novice learning `to go for the fundamentals' in his analytical duties to a `fundamentalist' campaigner for Pakistan's disengagement from US foreignpolicy. If the `war on terror' becomes `the single most important priority of the human species', he declares, `then the lives of those of us who lived in lands in which such killers also lived had no meaning except as collateral damage.'      It is this sensibility towards the wretched of the earth that informs Changez's narrative, and it is expressed with a self-contradicting zeal that denies his listener any character whatsoever. We never get to learn much about the latter - indeed, Hamid himself suggested in a recent interview that Changez's obscure interlocutor is there to accommodate the reader - he becomes in a sense, a space through which anyone of us could contemplate the story. The narrator often curbs his own talk and barges onto the listener's thoughts, instructing him every now and then to shed off his paranoia, prejudice and xenophobia. It is a technique previously utilized by Orhan Pamuk in order to portray the ambivalent nature of the `fundamentalist' frame of mind.       `No country inflicts death so readily upon the inhabitants of other countries, frightens so many people so far away, as America', writes the Pakistani-born Hamid. But then he adds, through his protagonist, `I was perhaps more forceful on this topic than I intended'. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is effective because in its brevity it pulls off a poignant and yet self-critical indictment of post-9/11 America.  Mohsin Hamid's depiction of a hesitant fundamentalist is itself anything but reluctant - it lays bare an astonishing insight into the complex power-mongering of our age, and is performed with a relish in storytelling that promises more of Hamid, and soon.
0425166805|5|Although they seem a little far fetched, especially in this consumerist world where one will only believe that which is placed in front of him as &quot;proof&quot;, I highly enjoy reading Erich Von Daniken's theories relating to the possible origins of human civilization. I mean think about it for a minute, what if the theories were in fact, true? Would you then believe?<br />Von Daniken's first book &quot;Chariots of the Gods?&quot; fascinated me when I read it in high school, not because of his writing style (which he really should have worked on), but rather the fact that it was putting out new ideas which were completely &quot;taboo&quot; at the time. Yes, the UFO craze was in full force with everyone, and their mother writing about &quot;visitors&quot; from &quot;spaceships&quot; doing everything from experimenting on humans to impregnating females, but this was the first time that someone created a theory that human civilization could have indeed been founded by these ancient &quot;gods&quot; in their &quot;flying machines&quot;.<br />I'm not saying that any of it is true (nor his other works), but I get him credit for creating a theory that would go on to influence everyone from Graham Hancock to Robert Temple. Pick this up, and read with an open mind.
B00957T6X6|5|Good read. Watched the series and now reading the book. Lost my place on the kindle and I can't go to the next book until I rate this book.<br />Edited:Sol unable to open the next book in the series after trying many Amazon and Kindle suggestions.
B004DLPXAO|1|Open kindle readernfor android for the second time ever qnd it crashes my android tablet. Try several times , even do a hard reset and to no avail. The app can not be used. So if an app is unusable and crashes the whole system after one day of use, I don't think it deserves even 1star. I'm foing to try and reinstall and see what happens. But ar the moment I'm not impressed in the least. This hurts amazon's brand immensely for me, as I didn't even consider another reader or another place to purchase ebooks until now, as I searc I'm sure I'll be in for other surprises. I.e. I wonder if I can read my ebooks from amazon on anpther reader.<br /><br />It appears I can't submit without selecting at least one star...

B0047Y0FGY|3|Maybe my expectations were so high because I love her on 30 Rock and SNL, so I was expecting to laugh my way through the book.  There are some funny parts of the book, but I was not rolling over laughing.  There are only a couple of funny sections in the book.  I do like her autobiographical format and can hear her saying the words in the book.
0399255370|5|Very clever book. My grandson will enjoy this story, especially as he gets old enough to understand the intended humor.
B00IKZX1ZI|5|Who does not like frozen? This game is AWSOME and knowing that it is from frozen makes it even better. I recommend it to everyone. Great game so gar!
B00BPDR3F6|3|I liked the writing style of this book.  I loved some of the unique discriptions worded with art and skill, but the story could not get off the ground.  Parts of it were so long and tedious I shivered.  Too bad, I am afraid even though I enjoyed some  parts of this book I don't feel that I can recommend it over all.
0758232225|5|This book was very insightful. It made me take the book to church for my pastor's wife to read.  It gave me a renewed desire to live the way God want's me to live.  Thank you Vanessa Davis Griggs for the inspiration. Keep it up.
B0073LWEXK|5|This is one of the very few games I downloaded for myself. It has great graphics and no time pressure. The puzzles range from simple to difficult but all are solvable if you stop, study the image, and think. The map is gorgeous and very useful. Before downloading I noticed several comments about the map being useless but I disagree strongly...it is easy to use.<br /><br />One thing I really like is this game is nonlinear. I can solve the puzzles in any order, skipping and going back to solve a puzzle later if I need to. Some puzzles obviously need other puzzle solutions to solve them but I can ignore them until I figure out that and go solve others.
1781253943|5|A must read for all of us....cannot recommend this book<br />more highly....excellent guide, has brought many honest conversations,<br />among friends and family members.
B00P596I8Y|5|Not really a horror movie fan, so it takes a good story to draw me into the genre. This was it. Very well crafted story, very well acted. Typically I find child actors more annoying than believable, much of which has to do with their parts being written for miniature adults rather than kids. This boy nails it. I won't give away any spoilers, but I will say I thought about the story and its meanings. Highly recommended.
B0027MJU00|5|While I guessed who did it before the end - the ride getting there was amazing.<br /><br />Well written and full of twists.  I love how Flynn seamlessly writes between the past and present - each chapter bringing you closer to the climax.  The events of present in a way line up to the events from the characters past - and things &#34;click&#34; at the right times.  You may not know exactly what is going to happen next, and you don't be disappointed when you find out.
B00KWNQTXM|1|it does not work
B004EPYZSU|4|I like getting the extended editions because they tell the story better, the theatrical editions are a story some editor wants you to see. I don't like being told what is better by some person that don't know how to tie their shoes, they still believe in the tooth fairy
B00A6PD9I4|4|This was a good movie for the kids.  The movie has a message and this message will teach kids to be grateful for what they have and appreciate the love of a mother. Also send a message to parents to let their children choose for themselves. It was nice to have all this in a movie. It was entertainment for the whole family.
B008Y6RGFE|4|It was awesome!
076115728X|5|Our little one isn't born yet, but we started reading to her from the first weeks that we knew she was in there.  This book is a fantastic addition to her library. It's colorful and will absolutely get her imagination going.  We can't wait to read it to her after she's born!
B00GX59QO2|2|watched this last week and can barely remember anything about it. (forgettable with a few good laughs)  It was like a  parody of itself.
B0031KE9C6|5|Never watched this show because I assumed it was sci-fi. A friend finally convinced me to watch the trailer and now I'm hooked.
B000055Y0X|5|Very happy...  great value...  Thank YOU...  +++++
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Not a bad game for a free one. If anyone expects more then loom for a paid game instead. You get what you pay for
6305161992|4|There is a Reason Dolph Lundgren has been around and it's not because of his incredible acting skills.  The reason is that he is one of the icons of cheesy action films.  So when you get an action comedy such as this it makes for a fun little trip for an hour and a half.<br /><br />The story here is that Dolph Lundgren is police officer on the trail of the iron claw, a group of yakuza run by a man who murdered his parents when he was a child.  He teams up with a wise cracking Brandon Lee and together along with a sexy Tia Carrea they take down the Sinister Drug Lord.<br /><br />What makes the movie funny is that Dolph Lundgrens character is an america who is totally into the Japanese way of the Samurai while Brandon Lee grew up an American Mall Rat and is a fish out of water at some of the places that they go to search for these criminals.<br /><br />Overall this is a simple early 90's action film that appeals to those who like to spend an afternoon hooting and hollering at bad guys getting their @$$ handed to them as well as the usual gratiouse nudity and one liner moments.  Leathel Weapon this is not but for a good low price, you can't go wrong.
B0000DBJDM|5|This DVD Contains 2 versions of the same concert, The Original and The Director's Cut.  When you first watch this DVD, Do NOT Select \\"Play Movie\\" from the title menu.  Instead, select 'Bonus Materials' and Then \\"Original Film.\\"   <br /> <br />The Original Is Certainly the the way to watch this concert.  The Director's cut omits many visual effects from the original film, and shows different, but less interesting camera angles.  The flow of the concert is also sabotaged by the forceful addition of 'behind the scenes' footage of the band creating The Dark Side Of The Moon in between songs in the Director's Cut.  The Footage is valuable and interesting, but it ruins the 'feel' Of the concert.
B00005QEO2|5|I've never been what you would call a huge Aerosmith fan, but over the years, I've owned several of their albums and I consider &quot;Pump&quot; to be one of my favorite rock-albums of all time.  In my opinion, that was their most consistent album and I can still never get tired of playing the thing.  Songs like &quot;the other side&quot;, &quot;what it takes&quot;, and &quot;love in an elevator&quot; never wear out their welcome and always manage to bring back memories of my child-hood.  Permanent Vacation also had some good tunes, as well as Get a Grip and Nine Lives, but I never made the effort to buy ALL of them.  I guess this set was put together for casual fans like me and I'm really glad for having picked it up.  On here, are 34 songs culled from their Geffen years and, in all honesty, there really isn't a weak track.  I liked the double-live set &quot;A Little South of Sanity&quot; and I find it a little puzzling that they would include the live version of &quot;Hole in My Sole&quot;.  But, then again, that's just me.  Also, we get &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; from the Beavis and Butthead Experience and &quot;Blind Man&quot; from the 1994 greatest hits &quot;Big Ones&quot;.  <br />This is a fantastic &quot;hits&quot; package and my only complaint is that there wasn't more stuff from Nine Lives.  But oh well, can't have everything.  All in all this is a solid buy that even the rabid fans may want to have.  It's good times.
B004X75RK4|5|I LOVE THIS MOVIE
B000V86OKG|5|My husband and I love Dexter and when we bought it a couple of years ago from amazon we had to buy the second. And of course the third and fourth............
B00957T6X6|5|Great price. It's not uncomfortable the fact it comes in just one book. It's good to have the five books in one.<br />The index works perfect.<br />Maps can be zoomed to check for details.<br />It's a great deal
B00O8OVX2S|5|The most entertaining dbz scenes of all.
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is amazing as a comic book fan I loved this game for it has what no other game has it show what the down fall of superheroes will be other superheroes.
B00CFNUMD0|5|Love Shaun the sheep! Very peppy! Kids and adults will love it! Wonderful! Great stress reliever! Laughs a minute! Great!
B00DR0PDNE|5|Excellent Product!
B007EECSFA|5|Love Kate Morton!  Can't wait for her next book.
1853261580|4|This is a wonderful story and a great book I was able to share with my students.  The only drawback with the book is that the pages are not in color, but the extremely low price allowed me to purchase the books for my students out of my own pocket.
0967984602|5|I ran a summer family camp in July 2002 and built the smaller oven in one day.  I had kids from age two to fifty two stomping the clay, sand, hay and water with thier feet. I set fire in the oven on day two and made our first loaf of bread.  The directions are easy to follow and was a hit with my fourty campers.  I would highly recommend this book.  A great family or group activity!  Loved it.
B00MIA0KGY|5|One of my favorite CDs. Love all the artists Barbra sings with.
159448385X|4|I had read his first book, and, really liked the way he writes.  He is able to describe events and happenings in a very authentic manner.
B0047E9TRA|5|This oldie is always a great watch.  Acting is outstanding and sissy gets revenge in the end.  If you have not seen this movie and enjoy fiction and blood its recommended.
B007CIQ4B2|5|Ben Howard's debut collection is a wonderful mixture of moods. His voice often carries a load of woe, as in \\"Black Flies,\\" and his lyrics most often come from life's disappointments. His percussive picking style and non-standard tunings (CGCGGC in \\"Old Pine,\\" and CFCFGC in \\"Everything,\\" for example) give both energy and a minor-key edge. On first listening, you think, \\"This is not happy music.\\" But Howard doesn't simply report that love is precarious and fleeting, or that the future holds pain, or that the most beautiful places remind us of losses--he knows the formula: beauty is beauty because it dies. Beauty and loss are fused together throughout these songs, which are filled with moments when pain is redeemed by its poetry: \\"Gracious goes the ghost of you . . .\\" and  \\"As the old pine fell we sang / Just to bless the morning,\\" and in the hypnotic \\"Promise,\\" \\"Who am I, darling to you? / Who am I? / I come alone here / I come alone here.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, too, the music itself trumps the meanings, as in the upbeat cadences of \\"The Wolves\\": \\"Now that we're lonely / Now that there's nowhere to go,\\" and sometimes the result is toe-tapping happy, as when he sends off a former lover with the driving chorus, \\"Keep your head up, keep your heart strong / No, no, no, no . . .\\" The opening song, \\"Old Pine,\\" is a nice summary of the ironies found throughout: memories of youth and friends and spontaneity are \\"the best things you ever had,\\" yet \\"We grow, grow, steady as the morning / We grow, grow, older still.\\"<br /><br />The more you listen, the more you'll hear. Ben Howard's the real deal.
B007N8RULO|5|Like this version of spider, no nonsense, clear screen, ability to make changes for background, and gives you stats.
0780625129|3|OK this is a good movie , it has a good story on rascial prejudice and how our own hatred only ignites violence after violence. But I was perturbed by the use of &quot;skinheads&quot; over and over again , and how they were all presented as shaved headed doc marten wearing nazi's. The characters in the films were neo-nazis , not skinheads. True skinheads are anti rascist working class people who believe in unity and family support. Skinheads were given a bad name by movies such as this who portrayed all of us skins as people who shave our heads and wear swastikas , and the media also ignited more violence from blacks on skins because they thought anyone who shaved their head and claimed to be a skin was a rascist. This film does the same. Constantly saying skinhead over and over. Now the film is great to watch in terms of it's message , but it still gives us skins a bad reputation.
B00AUOLIO8|5|Timeless, faithful to the book with appropriate changes or omissions
B00005JNJ7|5|wake up fellow reviewer who says the sex scene drags on too long(its about 30 seconds and that kids will want to know more about the \\"birds and the bee's\\". Well first of all...its not really a sex scene because they are not really people see? Because(suprise) they are PUPPETS. They dont have genitals because they are PLASTIC! with strings too! Shut up to all you idiots who cant tell the difference and who are offended so easily. Oh ya....you dont think your little Johnny knows about the \\"birds and the bee\\" already? Then why is he putting KEN's hand under BARBIE's skirt? Just go on sheltering your kids from movies and games, but let them watch the 6 oclock news where real people are getting blown up daily. Thats SO much better.
B001FB4W0W|5|Loved it. Such an exciting and strangely romantic beginning.
6302968100|4|Apocalypse Now would have probably never been surpassed as to having so many great actors brought together to make one incredible film. But True Romance did just that. Okay, it's not exactly the greatest film of all  time, come on now. It's just a fun movie to watch, especially if you're a  film buff. With each turn, a new superstar emerges and delivers one of  his/her greatest performances in a great long while. Maybe it's the  naturality of the dialogue in Tarantino's script; I consider it to be his  best yet! Of course those of you who've seen the movie... you know what I'm  about to say. The greatest scene in the film? Come on. You know what it is.  The Hopper/Walken scene! Yes! While it's certainly crude and offensive and  not found in your average Disney flick, this scene is the gem of this 2  hour romp. I can't really say what it's about, but it's really incredible  how well the chemistry between two great actors and one helluva script come  together. Gary Oldman is pretty freakin' good in this movie too. It's only  ashame that so many great actors didn't get enough screen time. Still, it's  a really good movie and well worth the few hard-earned bucks needed to dish  out for it. Simply a must-have for Tarantino junkies.
0385523912|5|I bought this for my husband, who is a historian, and he loved it! He actually gave it to one of his instructors as a gift!
B000E1ZBGS|1|I am a Kiera Knightly fan.  I did not care for this movie at all. It took me 3 times to watch the entire movie.  Watch the BBC version instead.
B00005JMAH|3|Since when is Albus Dumbledore a hippie?  The new Dumbledore's attire looked so sloppy and grungy...and don't get me started on that little hat!  There was absolutely nothing respectable about him.  He looked as though he was a regular on Knockturn Alley.  And since when did Hogwarts have a huge clock?  Director dude... stick to the book!  This movie was way too short and a complete let down.  Thank goodness they're getting a new director.
B00R3DOCJM|5|Excellent movie
B000L53D4O|5|My grandchild loved this toy.
B00FATEJYE|5|Love this game it is awesome and never ends
B00MI1X58S|5|Loved it!!!
0143058525|4|I fought reading this book.  I figured if Oprah loved it, then I was sure to hate this and not get past the third chapter. Then my aunt recommended it, and then the buzz because of the movie...So I broke down and bought it as an audiobook.  And I couldn't stop listening!  Especially loved the 1st and 2nd thirds of the book.  It touched me because I am 34 and making the same choices in my life that the author was making.  I chose husband and child instead, and enjoyed reading about the travels and trials of a person who chose the other side of that coin.  I enjoyed her journey. I laughed and I listened and I lived through her.  Wasn't as excited about the ending as I could have been, but it was her journey and not mine and I was glad she invited me along for the ride!  Most of us push so hard to reach our goals in life that we forget to live, and, for a moment, I lived the things she lived.  I applaud her for having the nerve to do what she did.  Read(or listen)to this book!
B00HB62MC0|5|I wish I could give this 100 stars. It deserves it. I think it's my favorite of Colleen Hoover's yet...and that's saying something! Beautifully written, real characters. Seriously amazing.
B008OE05IG|5|The film  reveals the joy that comes from working hard and producing a product of perfection.  The viewer also gains a great appreciation for the care that goes into the making of excellent food.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Good
B008JGSM6G|2|This app is great but you can only open it once.. So you have to play whole game once or then you have to remove it and download it again.. it is very fustraiting. But the actual gan  is really good and addicting be careful ;) Jjust do nlt close it... :/
B0000011AP|4|Ok, so they're a Led Zeppelin sound alike. But a very GOOD Zeppelin sound alike! Even though vocalist Peter French (ex Atomic Rooster) sounds more like Rod Stewart in places then Robert Plant it in no way detracts from the  music. In fact I personally believe his raspy bluesy voice enhances  the  songs. Some of the riffs at a few places seem to have been lifted right off  of one of the first three Zeppelin albums, but LEAFHOUND has added their  own creative interpretation to the songs so they can easily be considered  origonal. If you wish Led Zeppelin had put out just one more album in the  vein of their earlier stuff, then I heartily reccommend this album for your  collection!
B00110K62U|5|Definitely my favourite Christmas present!    2-CD special edition, with a (old and not hi-def) special 'making of' documentary on Disc 2 -interesting but not a must-have, even for the biggest fan.    The concert itself is just awesome though - filmed in the Royal Albert Hall with a full choir and orchestra, and a dream cast. Absolutely stunning sound, and wonderful to watch and listen to, even someone who hasn't seen the show would get a lot out of it. A gorgeous production.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is awesome! I can sit and play this game for hours. The  game is so addictive, you just can't stop playing!
B0000542D2|5|Love it
B0062NAVXA|5|This was a great product that exceeded my expectations. It really is great for a gift.  I love it and will buy more.
B0073LWEXK|5|Love this style of game.  This was much more challenging than Grisly Manor which for me was great. Like that they added the hint guide in case you get stuck.  The game was easy to navigate and the graphics were good too.
B00AREIAI8|3|it is a pretty fun game. I think that anyone that lile uorses would like this game. Although it is kinda corny, but what ever.
0385742894|4|Interesting shift from the well-known MR characters.  Added to the story to know the background of how it all began.  More of a fan of the first and second installment in this series, but this is still worth the read!
0525953728|2|The book was ok but boring at times.  I did not like the book but found the details as the news agency's had reported.  It was a waste of time and money
B0012PDVUS|5|Good film!
B000JMKRKC|5|Really enjoyed this book, was especially fun to read about people that enjoy reading so much.  It can really take you away and that really came across well.  I also love a good mystery that keeps you guessing until the end.
B00KMX5V8G|5|It's fun.
B00TYB95I4|5|Simply an AWESOME movie. I saw previews before the oscars so I wanted to check this out anyway. Was I glad I did. Being a part time musician myself its easy to relate to the frustrations of pushing yourself more than what your capable of. Miles (the drummer) does a great job of playing the frustrated and sometimes discouraged aspiring musician. From the moment he meets his soon to be music teacher played by J.K. Simmons, you immediately know that this is going to be bad. J.K. definitely plays a real blankety blank in this one. His drive is to push his students to the breaking point to get every ounce of talent he can out of them. I don't want to give away the whole plot but suffice it to say, its a miracle that he has any teeth left.<br /><br />Even with the entire story unraveling in front of you, its not until the end that you really find out what this music teacher is capable of. The last half hour is by far the BEST part of the movie and by the end if you don't have one hell of a stupid grin on your face mixed in with a bit of anger and &#34;what the heck just happened&#34; then you are dead inside. LOL.<br /><br />This movie is a keeper and I will most definitely be getting it on Blu Ray for my collection to watch again over the years. It should have won Best Picture just for its message alone. It is both inspiring and disheartening at the same time but the thrill ride you experience, especially at the end, will make it worth the ride. Most definitely a WOW movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5|Does everything I need it to do.  I don't understand why a person have to write a review 20 words long to be accepted.  All I really had to say about this calculator is the first sentence. Hope they're happy know.
B000WQWPKA|4|good deal
B00BC254I8|4|Starts out like a boxer looking for a knock out in the first round, but stalls and tires by the end of the book.
B007ORV092|5|Good quality delivered immediately. I will definitely purchase another show to watch. Im hooked. Not sure which series to start on next.
B0069JBKHI|3|Great and easy setup.  However, we found the video lag too long, so it ends up being an audio monitor with still frames of your child.  Its a bit too pricy for an audio monitor.  We are returning it and going with Foscam cameras.  The setup is more complicated, but once you have it up and running the video and audio are great.
0345472322|2|Dr Dweck offers an obvious insight, that the motivated among us have the better tools to learn.  However she offers no empirical data in her book to justify her supposition that intellegence is not a fixed trait.  For all the anguish Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein created with The Bell Curve, at least they provide the reader with the charts and graphs of peer reviewed data.  This book offers no such thing.  If the goal of this book is self help for the quitters out there, I think it has value.  But as a work of educational relevance, it either needs some citations or it needs to be recognized for what it is, mere psychobabble pap.
0061438294|5|I really enjoyed reading this book, I am actually using everything this book talked about in my daily life, it works and makes me feel better about my surroundings.
B009HQ9UHC|3|Hi I was trying to get the application bad piggies however it will not install it says there was an error but when I do what it suggests it does nothing I used to have this and I loved it but m data got wiped so I have to get all my games back and books please fix the problem so I can get the app/game bad piggies when I did have it the game was great
B004J4WLB4|5|Hopeful, real, life affirming,read like a true story,as earth shattering as it was it left me with a feeling of sweetness and faith in life and in mankind.
B00F8GYC1Y|5|It is a great game for every one to play lots of fun and in my opinion it's better than the original
B009EE1GC4|4|Good movie...glad I bought it....moves a little slow but love the characters. ..easy easy purchase
B00003CX5P|3|I wanted the original movie with Mark Hamill.  How can I get it?
B004OO4UFY|4|The game has two of the songs on here, both of which match and set the tone of the game simultaneously. I felt compelled to buy the album. It's a very creative work and it sounds good to my ears.
B00HGJ18C2|1|It's hard too have fun with this many ads. Ugh!
B008NA3I30|1|I just finished watching this movie and Im happy Im not the only one who didnt like this movie. I love Seth Rogan, but I swear I didn't understand what was going on between Seth's character and Margo. Margo was emotionally up and down. And then the end..like what really happened..there was a lot of things left unsaid and I guess I had to be a really intellectual person to understand.<br /><br />BTW: The naked women shower scene was not needed. Yikes! :/
B00PTB7B34|5|The most epic game for a tablet I have played in a long time.
B00HZ3C4N6|4|Interesting plot with lots of action
B00L9B7IKE|4|This book is better if you don't read it on a Kindle.  The characters are confusing at the beginning and it was hard to keep them straight.  The story gets better as the book moves along.
B001E45XT4|5|I love the sound, it feels like I'm inside a movie theater.  If you are looking for something discrete, this may not be for you! I even get joked around by the family when I'm wearing this headphones.  It blocks external noise to a certain extend.  Headphones like this ones usually make my ears sweaty and after some time they begin to hurt, with this headphone all that is gone!  Recommended!
B008Y2FRFO|5|I am so addicted to this game, and it is just like the one at the fair but I don't have to wait for the next time the fair / carnivals are in town!!
B00MNYTWMI|5|This app is pretty awesome. If you liked finding items hidden in the old highlights magazines you'll love this!!!!
B00AMUOP22|5|I love when songs I like come out on singles!  This is a great example - love it!  It was delievered super fast as well.  In great condition.
