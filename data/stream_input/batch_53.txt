B00766JBEC|5|Perfect
B001F770WI|5|it works!
B007VIOWIU|5|works ok
B00062YWM4|2|Hard to use
B002D3KR4Q|5|Bought this to protect my rear bumper when my Golden Retriever jumps in and out.  Fit well, easy to (carefully) apply.  Much better price than the dealer's version.
B00T17PIJ6|4|Haven't used it yet, seems to be of hugh quality should work fine.
B000C7QM44|5|Replacement radiator for a Spec Racer Ford. You will need to plug up the overflow with RTV and give it a good crimp but it works great. Hoping I don't have to buy many more of these in the future but I would buy again.
B00P99KKAM|5|Love it...mine was black in color.  Hands feel better gripping the cushioned places.  Does not get hot with sun exposure.
B009XFDYNS|4|good cranking power and fast shipping
B00OSZ2N08|5|I actually used it for juice carton boxes and water bottles. It held up well, unlike other organizers that were too shallow and flimsy.
B00PBO0Z3M|5|perfect
B000TDQGCE|5|Very easy to install with the right hardware.  Used Lag bolts and washers on a wood dock.<br />Easy tie up,  , folds down when not in use, eliminates stubbed feet/toes.<br />Great quality.
B000NTJNTC|5|Easy to install and worked as expected. Perfect fit.
B00GEYMRY8|5|Cool lights. They are still working. I installed them months ago.
B00F2ODQ9G|1|Too small!.. A little disappointed in how small it is...
B00FQQFCQU|5|Great quality banner. Im very pleased with how it turned out. I installed mine on a roof basket.  I put a few layers of clear coat to protect it
B010H0QV7S|4|I've been using a little keychain sized digital tire gauge for years and it has done the job pretty well.  It was nothing fancy at all, no backlight, just a simple LED display.  When I saw that this tool had a backlight on the tire gauge readout I was thrilled but that functionality is what I ended up liking the least about this product.<br /><br />►► TIRE GAUGE ◄◄<br /><br />Since this is mainly sold as a tire gauge it is unfortunate that my only two gripes about the product are with the way the tire gauge operates.  The first is the backlight.  When you turn the gauge on the backlight comes on but unfortunately only stays on for 10 seconds.  Yes, this is enough time to turn the unit on and get a reading on one tire.  The problem is once the backlight goes off you have to press the power button again which turns the backlight on but also cycles to the BAR measurement instead of PSI.  So, in order to do each tire with the backlight you'll need to press the power button 4 times each time.<br /><br />The other odd thing, for me, was the orientation of the LED screen facing inwards to the tire itself instead of outwards where the person getting the reading would be located.  Again, like the backlight, not a major inconvenience but the process could have been way more intuitive with a couple small tweaks.<br /><br />Neither of these things was a huge deal but they brought this down to a 4-star product instead of a 5-star product.  If you use the product only when you have bright light you will probably never need the backlight and the gauge is still fairly to read upside down.<br /><br />►► EMERGENCY TOOLS ◄◄<br /><br />The extra added bonus features of this tire gauge are what make it really worth having in your vehicle.  It contains a pop-up glass breaker and a seatbelt cutter.  Both of these could end up saving someone's life if they ever find themselves in a situation where they need to use them.<br /><br />The flashlight portion of this tool is pretty weak.  It might help you find something in your vehicle at night but that is about it.  The same with the red LED, it's an ok feature to have but not all that useful.<br /><br />►► CONCLUSION ◄◄<br /><br />This is a nice, accurate tire gauge that is still recommended besides the small issues with the tire gauge readout.  The readings I got from the gauge were accurate and quick and the addition of the seatbelt cutter and glass smasher make this something that will make me feel safer knowing I have it in the glovebox.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.ty weak.

B00FO7743A|5|Arrived quickly and is just what I hoped for and needed!!!
B008GMM46W|5|Matches perfectly with my Florida license plate and some of the people I've met here. A fun reminder to stay alert while out enjoying the water.
B004I0H86C|5|Well, my usually handy dad read the instructions and decided he didn't want to fool with taking the back part of the car apart. So they're not actually installed right now, but he did pry the old ones off & set these in so that they look installed. I'm satisfied. If I decide to have them properly installed, I can do that later.
B001AWL7RM|5|Works great on my Suzuki ltz
B00JN0U4SQ|4|nice but it appears to be changing color from black to bronze due to the texas heat.
B000CPI62W|5|Seems solid. Haven't used it yet. Actually need an 8in drop but this should work
B000B5QFE4|4|Easy design. Slides right on. But be aware that if you have after market mirror covers they will have to be removed. I ended up breaking my after market mirror covers trying to get them off (they were glued on).
B00030CYU6|5|Great price will do business again
B00M5YC7Q4|5|Easy install, looks and works great.
B00BFY066I|5|Fast shipping and great price.
B00CAJ6O4A|2|it really has a cheap look,<br />I remove it a couple days after I installed becouse it really gives my car a bad look.<br /><br />I found another product, for the same price and also fro chine, that really look like the OEM.
B002YKICYA|5|Perfect!
B004ETK0AI|2|The carrier does not support the weight of the items I have in it: 2 plastic containers of Armor All car cleaner, a bottle of water, kleenex, and few other small items. The unit does not come with a lower strap so it moves when I'm driving. It also hangs low and pulls away from the seat so it bothers the person sitting in the back seat.  I would not buy this again.
B00NTU18KY|5|we repair smart phones and tablets and we mounted one of these in one of the trucks and it actually helps out a lot because we actually know how much the battery is draining how many watts it actually helps with a diagnosis of the problem I will be equipping all of our repair trucks with this product thank you
B002P8D5E8|3|great for the price but the first package was shipped with a the attachment plastic cracked.
B00JPNTTI2|3|It's just ok. Very airy and cool. Great armor features. My main complaint is this jacket is frumpy. There are no tightening straps on your waist, only at the hips. So it balloons out while you sit and makes you look fat. Definitely not a flattering jacket. But it provides protection and is very airy/cool for summer riding
B004I9K7QG|4|It doesn't cover as much as I'd have liked it to on my 14 Ninja 650 but it does stick well and I'm less paranoid about any zipper scratches from the huge package I have.<br />The tank pad is a bit small which isn't really as helpful when my tank has a heavy flow day.
B006DB0RSK|4|It's in, & it works However the old bolts will not fit the plastic transmission (3 bolts) More time is spent finding screws (and washers since the new ones a significantly smaller)  than installing the unit I would have paid 15 cents more and had it come with the mounting screws (The original bolts do fit the metal bracket)  I don't believe this is a &#34;TYC&#34; product as the TYCs come in a package clearly marked (This comes in an unmarked box ), also the TYCs I have recently purchased come with the mounting bolts, and a sticker on the motor that says TYC.  I still paid half the price as I would at the parts store, and it came in about a week
B00KRI13TM|5|Great cheap and easiy way to illuminate license plate on my motorcycle after removing rear fender. Allowed bike to pass inspection.
B00HAQ7HQM|5|The hatch on our 2008 Accent actually lifts on its own now. Easy to replace and good warranty.
B000WKAV2U|5|worked fine on my bike
B0069TND14|5|Great Lights for the back of the toy  hauler fifth wheel
B000GARNF4|5|Great price
B001OMPJGS|3|Are brighter, but not as much brighter as I had hoped.  No installation instructions of any kind.  Not even direction to a website to download them.
B003S1RQ2S|5|Didn't really save any money but it was convenient.  It worked fine after it charged for a while.
B000CM2UUO|4|Color match was good. I had to use the old gasket as the new one was too big and the mirror wouldn't attach properly.<br />Overall I am happy with the purchase
B00NI00D74|5|Actually put this on my office door (which is glass), I think it gets the point across...
B00THR39SC|5|These work perfect for my 2003 Chevy Silverado! Paintable which us nice I put Rustoleum truck bed liner on them and sealed them with an auto body silicone between the flares and the truck so no water would get in between them!
B00LM5527S|5|I LOVE these! I absolutely cannot find this aroma anywhere anymore!<br />I plan to buy more!
B00A3H62FC|4|I like it and the shipping was fast but I assumed that some sort of padded backrest would come with it and it did not. Now I am stuck trying to figure out which backrest to buy or which goes with this model because the listing didn't reference any backrest to complete this installation. Very disappointed.
B00KULLQZ2|5|Great pads.
B0031I2SN0|5|Great fit
B00E1SNW8E|5|Excellent no sound or any other default
B009T9FJCC|4|These fit the front my 2013 Kia Soul base just ad good as weathertek. Only negative I see is the finish looks harder to clean.
B003MQ89X4|2|Does not have up to date software, and can not send codes to my Nissan Leaf to get detailed battery status.<br /><br />Does not work with LeafSpy app.  App reports that this ELM327 device does not support required command &#34;AT FC&#34;
B00KV9ULXQ|1|ordered these but half of the lights didn't work in my boyfriends car. had to take them all out. got no use for them.
B0024GIVM2|5|Easy to mount, worked like a seat belt should
B00FMPSJX8|5|Great bag!  Fits the ProTaper handlebars on my Suzuki DR650SE perfectly.  Small size just right for registration and toll money with extra space for a small camera and a little more.
B00BSG0DZM|5|This is a follow up to a review I made afer just receiving the bag. Just spent five days in the South Michigan Reservoir area of No. Colo. First, it rained parts of all five days. This rig in 100% water proof. The contents stayed perfectly dry. Second, the only concern I had about the bag was the single cross bar support in the bottom. It stayed in place, never needing adjusting. I hauled my tent and cot out strapped to its' top, and it handled it with no problem. Third,, I accidently tested the material strength against a broken tree limb. I dreaded what I would see, but the material is hell for tough. Can't think of anything else to say about it---rather than it's tough as hell, waterproof, great construction, good strong strap system, and the steel frame holds up without a hitch.  Out of the box, snapped/strapped, on the wheeler, less than 30 minutes.Love this bag already. For my use, much better than the hard side rack boxes for one reason, this one can be easily removed when I don't need it. Great construction, strong non-slip straps. Good investment.
B00139YMUQ|5|Fantastic tool.  But, battery gives you no warning when it goes out!  It uses a typical &#34;button&#34; battery but if you need it in the middle of the night, you are not going to find one of these easily.  The light helps you air tires in the dark.
B001CF1A7O|5|I like it it does what it needs to do. Painted my d ring red looks great as well
B007ZDNMQE|5|The shift knob came fast and fits perfectly  on my 2013 Ford Focus SE. Couldn't beat the price either! The knob has a great finish and it is nice and heavy. The knob is a little smaller than I expected, but it feels great in my hand. I would definitely buy another Blox knob.
B000VKYQAE|3|Had to cut the pipes to make it bolt up right. The exhaust place I went to said it was faulty pipes and my one coming off my muffler hangs down lower had to bend the bar in the back to make it fit right so the one didn't sag. Having said that it sound great and helps my engine breath better love it minis the defects!
B00076RLG8|5|just what i needed
B000C9TB0Y|5|Fit and work perfectly in my 2002 Tundra.
B009XIQ9G4|5|great product great price
B00MIZTAK6|5|This is so awesome, I love it. It's adorable, discreet and really heavy duty! Will definitely inflict a ton of pain if needed.
B00515R0AC|3|Comes with one big and one small. discolors after time and looses its tight fit.
B00RXXLJGG|4|Works well; color totally matches the color of my interior
B001O06IRY|5|Does the job!
B000MK5NAU|3|I installed this on my 2001 5.3L Silverado in conjunction with the Volant throttle body spacer. Installation was a nightmare. There are these 2 foam gaskets that sandwich the wall of the air box and mount up to the Mass Air Flow sensor. It would have been better if they were something more sturdy like rubber. You get 3 small allen key bolts that you have to get lined up with the MAF sensor, the 2 foam gaskets, the airbox and the filter adapter. Also, you can't see when you thread them. You're doing it by feel unless you can pull back the filter adapter enough to sort of get an idea of where you're aiming. Holes in the bottom of the airbox do not line up very well with the factory mounts on the truck. You may have to file the holes out to get a better fit. The same goes for the cover. The tubular section of this product was the worst. It doesn't fit on the truck if you also installed the Volant throttle body spacer. You don't have enough clearance between the throttle body and fan shroud. You have to cut an inch off the tube that mounts up to the throttle body to get it to fit. And after you cut it, You have to wrestle with it to get it on the throttle body. Make sure you clean the burrs off the edge where you had to cut. Once you finally get everything installed, you can see the air box is so large that you will have to remove it to get at any light bulbs on the front passenger side of the truck. Even as frustrating as the installation was, once I took the truck around the block I could see it performed quite well. Very good acceleration and faster throttle response. Truck's got some go now. I guess my biggest complaint about this product is, for the money you're spending, you shouldn't need to be modifying the kit to make it fit in the vehicle it is advertised to fit in. No arguments with performance though. Very happy on that end. Also, the large air box breathes well, and still draws air from the passenger fender where the air is cleaner.
B00BDO48XM|5|Sealed my new 2015 Mazda CX-5 yesterday and the car was not even dusty like it always is the next day. I didn't even have to use my car duster. The shine is really amazing too. I couldn't stop staring at it.<br /><br />Very easy application as well. After a car wash and polishing out all of the flaws(bird dropping stains) in the paint, I used the chemical guys blue applicators and spread the product evenly on half of each panel at a time. I spread it on for about 30-40 seconds then buffed off with a clean microfiber towel. If you leave it on for too long, it will become difficult to remove. Also best to start from top to bottom so that you can deal with the dirtier areas last.<br /><br />I also love how you can use this on plastic trims, chrome, glass, etc. Buy this product NOW if you want your car looking brand new and if you want to protect the paint from future harsh elements that can damage the paint such as bird droppings, water spots, etc. I wish I would've bought this a long time ago. You will have no regrets, trust me!
B000C01X0E|5|Great replacement drums for my 92 civic. Worked well with the Monroe shoes I got.
B0042XI3D2|2|Cheap cheap cheap! Junk!
B003YJLAIK|5|This made a big difference in our RV.  It worried me that the regular &#34;straight&#34; regulators really didn't control pressure, just flow rate.  This keeps the pressure in the RV piping to 45 psi and not the line pressure from the riser.
B00YT57MNA|5|This was better than I expected fit perfect and was the perfect size
B000234IT4|5|did the job great lifting my 10 ton dozer
B0017T3P28|1|Perhaps this has a place in other scenarios but this jack performed terribly for me. I used this to pull 8 ft wooden posts anchored by concrete out of the ground. I struggled getting adequate leverage. The only success I had was to get a little lift but shortly thereafter the post would crush under the stress of the chain. I had MUCH better  success using a tractor jack, chain and digging foot deep trench so that I could wrap the chain around the concrete. The tractor jack gave me adequate leverage to repeatedly pop several posts out of the ground. This thing nearly killed me!
B000C5HJWK|4|It filters air......?
B003YMRO3W|5|it works normaly as the original.
B0023VOXIO|5|They expedited the shipment of the tail light and were very responsive and helpful!  Thank you!! Cathy
B0023W5E6S|5|I hit a deer. And smashed much of my 2008 Mazda 3.. This and many other parts worked perfect and brought my car back to normal
B00265FXTA|5|Thanks!
B005HXSSFE|4|Hard to get secured down
B005ZS1PYW|5|Top notch. Well worth it!!!! Fast shipping!!!
B001AWHN7A|2|didn't help that much not  $ 200.00 worth a lot of noise comes from engine in cab but they don't tell you this
B00RZ4YTCO|4|Works great, looks great, a little too bright for dash.
B006MK5RNC|5|Fits good and serves its purpose.
B0007LZK9S|5|What can you say, it's a pin. Works great.
B009IUKWPG|5|nice steering speener
B000RXWGIY|5|Grat product
B00652G4TS|5|Shipping was quick and product works as promised with no hidden costs or fees. iOS software works well too. I am not sure I will be able to view air bag codes or ABS codes yet. Clearing codes and checking smog readiness is simple. I would recommend one for anyone with an auto out of warranty.
B00TFTHU5A|5|Fit great
B009K4H42Y|3|looks like i got the last of the A01 filters seeing other reviews. In the box were four A01 filters and one A02. Got ripped off on that last A02, useless Fram garbage. Will order from a more trusted source next time
B00VAVP6P2|5|It was here three days earlier than it was suppose to be, great quality. Exactly as described. Thanks!
B00TAD3RF8|5|its an idler arm--what can i say?
B00WF9GOMC|5|Works Great !! Improves gas mileages
B00O7YCQ9S|4|Great product for that safe feeling with a new driver.
B004Z2OP28|5|Nice sticker.  Really captures the essence of my Boston Terriers without the smell.....
B000JFHNEC|1|It was the wrong parts. I needed the conversion set to convert my r-12 to r-134
B008LXS2L2|4|great product at a fair price
B0043063JU|4|faded quite quickly
B002X91VTU|5|Got these for $40 they were a great buy and I do not regret it. These things are brand-spanking new!
B0041BKSGA|5|Precisely what I needed to keep the sun off my cargo trailer's tires. Looks like they are well made of good materials. So far so good, and reasonably priced.
B003G9IYQY|5|Worked like a champ and we're heating water with gas again!
B005ZWM0R4|5|Works great and comes bundled with a key for OBDwiz software. I used this to read various OBD2 PIDS from my 09 Accord.<br />I did not know this when i bought it but this scantool also works with Android. I tried it with my phone (ASUS Zenfone 2), with an USB on the Go adapter from Startech.<br />The android app is called OBDLink and I think its made by Scantool. Its available on google play.<br />The trick to make it work is to plug in the OBDLink SX into the car OBD port first, and then plug it into the phone, otherwise in might not be recognized by the phone. I think that the phone can`t power the OBDLink SX by itself, so it needs a boost from either the OBD port or a special OTG cable that allows for external 5V power.<br />The fact that i can use this with Android is great because i do not have to take out my laptop for simple things like reading codes, or checking some generic PIDS.<br />I have not tried to use this adapter with Torque, or any other Android app.<br />I might try it out and update at a later time.
B00IZRAEYW|4|I bought this to make my Bolt a little louder and more noticeable when I'm out on the road.  I like the look of it a lot better than the stock system on it.  The blacked out pipe looks good on it and a 2 into 2 exhaust is always good. Its louder than I thought it would be and gives it a nice rumble at idle.  The only thing I don't like is that they designed the heat shields to go on. They use hose clamps to attach them, I figured for the price you'd get a better design.  It installs easily and took me about 90 mins, mostly because I've never done one before and I was being cautious.  I heard that the Bolts run lean with this and you need a Fuel Pack to tune the bike. I didn't notice any lose in performance and it seems to be a little quicker with it and a Vance & Hines VO2 intake.  Highly recommend getting this exhaust if you want something better looking and more noticeable in traffic, but beware it is really loud when you get on the throttle or down shift.  It does pop a little when you close the throttle which I heard can be tuned out if you want to get the Fuel Pack.
B0000AY4KX|4|The only brand I use love the ruff grip.
B00C3ZA3XE|5|Just came today, I have used product before and liked it, does the job as listed
B00CP2U8DA|5|Perfect for 06 kdx200 fmf pipe
B00A6TUQQI|5|The steps are perfect!
B00N48BAZE|5|Parts were Good, same  with delivery  and price.
B000JWQ666|5|Product as described. Great!
B00T2GT9L4|5|Light weight and takes upittle space<br />Great and helpful customer service
B00KT1BH1Q|5|replaced Itasca 2014 motor home dash lights could barely see the dash with light coming if from front and angled from side  sun even with lights on it was a black hole . I took dash apart and replaced the dim incandescent match head bulbs .The sockets did not fit the holes in dash ,so I removed them and took the wire leads and soldered them direct to circuit board results incredible and the brightness control works even at lowest setting the bulbs are great at highest the effect is super good . I have had a life time of electronics repair so this was no problem . if you do not possess the skills don't do it your self get help.
B005JU5XOO|5|So far so good, no problems
B000FPY4IY|1|The product was warped to the extent where My engine would leak less oil without it
B008ECC31U|5|Just like the OEM Part!!  Fit perfect!
B00NIKN2BS|5|Really helped me get a tire back on the rim after having to change a tube, and I didn't have to worry about damaging the tube as much like when I used screw drivers before
B00ARJOSKM|5|So far it is still working. I bought this item to replace older coils. This coil helped improve the proper burn inside the cylinder. This item together with oxygen sensor, new sparkplugs and new valve cover gaskets. The car went from gross polluter to super clean car.
B00V9HLIN6|5|Nice product.
B00VLOEBK4|1|Filter falls off rubber piece! Lost 2 of em!
B00NLN8FKA|5|Barricade make some amazing products. These front fenders are no exception. I constantly have people asking me where I got them from. My only complaint would be to have documentation about how to install in the packaging. I do recommend a set of right angle socket adapters for installation against the firewall. This would have saved me a lot of time and bloody knuckles.
B007H34SKG|5|Awesome! came faster than me!
B0096QADHY|5|Good sturdy material. Arrived quickly.
B0074FQKDA|5|Excellent product!  Lights come up to full brightness just about immediately!
B0006MRRY4|5|Heavy duty adapter
B000EQP0IW|1|This product does not fit a 2005 GMC Yukon. Description is wrong.
B000CFGN1S|4|Hard to get much info on my 1984 Cutlass Supreme Calais - this manual is the best so far.
B00KHKV2UU|5|Very nice shirt. Fast shipping  and great quality material .
B00BMUARWI|5|Really great product, don't understand why Ekornes does not recommend it any longer.
B000EXSER4|4|This is just ok.  I still like my Stop & Go plugger better
B000AS3D3S|5|Great filter for my truck. Silicone ADV and threaded side bypass with above average filtration, all for cheaper than even the &#34;bargain&#34; oil filters, while filtering as well as those costing 3x as much.<br /><br />Wish Motorcraft made filters for my Toyota, I would use them on that too.<br />Amazon makes it easy to get a few shipped at a time to have some extras available.
B00OWS4TQ2|5|Looks good and fits great on 2015 f150!! The install instructions were confusing but thankfully it was easy enough to install. Will post back updates after a few weeks of use.
B001WWPZF0|5|This stuff works really well. I just used it for the first time and I have to say I'm impressed. It's very close to looking like I just waxed my car. I plan on using it between waxes. Works really well on glass and plastic too.
B001Y91MFI|5|Ordered for my son he had lost one of the factory ones. Looks just like factory one with out the Toyato symbol in middle. He likes them lot cheaper than rims.
B00YCSP9EI|4|Fit good on my 2014 Chevy silverado. ..set aside time to fit the rubber seal on ...front stud on flare will touch the fender on front ....over time will scratch it....but as long as you keep them on you will never see it
B0066QMMDA|5|Fit exactly as expected! Great quality air filter! Definitely will be purchasing this again in the future!
B00JBNYVSO|5|I have an older jeep with the rubber moldings and bumpers.  They were starting to turn grey across the top and I have tried a dozen trim restorers with little success.  Some are greasy, some wash right off, some leave streaks and attract dirt.  This one is the best by far.  Apply it, let it sit for a bit, buff it off.  The moldings and bumpers look brand new, it is not sticky or greasy so it doesn't attract dust.  I will definitely buy again.
B001GJ3DZS|5|This brush is great!  The bristles are soft and bushy, and the handle is very comfortable.
B001W4SSVQ|5|Can't get in touch with anyone about my tuner after a year . You should still be able to after buying for products tech support. Being that there are updates monthly for the programmer.
B000KYXD46|5|Received as advertised easy set using chicken dance found on internet search for programming fob. Would by again great product!!
B00S8A0932|1|It is hard to put the seatbelt on, so it does not work well in my car.
B000EQET7U|2|ordered my filters a couple days ago, thru the array of brands, chose this brand based on the photo showing it looked like a charcoal filter in leu of plain paper, that cost's a couple dollars less. its a little bait and switch. if your looking for charcoal, don't buy this brand
B00APR2F3I|5|Works great.
B000K12EA8|1|In the add, it shows lifting shell.  It is for a cane at 45 lbs.  buy the big one for shell
B00396DMMA|5|Great tool fast shipping. Could not have fixed my truck without it.
B00O96IHHO|5|Awesome air intake. Definitely gives the engine a throaty and sometimes loud  note.
B0078OAWV8|5|Perfect for my car.
B000GOF4Z6|4|Works great. My only issue was I had to move the ground connector to get it back into the duct housing.
B004GDSXP6|2|Part did not fit in my 1993 Grand Marquis due to the bolts on the top of the slide being welded too high. Impossible to use....UNLESS you take the wire/pulley assembly off and can attack that to the original slide.
B00166LS1W|5|Great product and perfect price.
B008ADH5DE|1|I received this tube with a 2 cm whole in it and did not bother with sending back..old one was just fine...
B003XV9EVY|5|Perfect fit...and fast delivery
B00F4JOOG8|5|Easy on. Looks great. Arrived quickly.
B0054LJ588|4|Minor grinding mods are needed to avoid sub frame contact but product is quality
B0094MG0VI|5|Great quality sicker looks good and will last long!! Mine has been through the car was plenty of times.
B00669PMWA|1|Really disappointed. Not sure exactly what I was expecting but wasn't expecting a picture. Really really disappointed! Just goes to show you though, didn't read close enough. Even my wife said it looked like it was raised in the picture. 23 years Army 11B, 16 months in Vietnam, still only deserve the worst I guess.<br />Returning it tomorrow bot buying anything like this Ever Again!
B0068C7066|4|Installed it on 2009 ER6N kawasaki, Great wind protection, upto neck. specially good for street bike is Er6n which has no wind protection.<br />Downside: The look of the bike is compromised and the installation instructions are not good.<br />Let me know if users want to see pictures
B003LMGDHI|5|This stuff is awsome, I detailed my friends 2013 genesis coupe that had very hard water spots and major swirls, This took it off after a couple of passes. I would recommend finishing it off with M205 but unfortunately i did not have the time. It still let an awesome shine and finish
B00GHT7JUC|5|Much better price than OEM, and just what I needed. Easy to install and everything works now.
B000AMBOIK|4|Totally old fashioned awesome trickle charger design in that it is not electronically controlled :) That can be &#34;GREAT&#34; or &#60;Harmful&#62; depending on what your need is or how it is used. As with manual transmissions, manual battery chargers are hard to find these days. Plugged it in and the transformer has a noticeable ac hum. Current draw 2 watts no load and about 20 when connected to battery. On my multimeter output showed 13.5v open circuit but when connected to a small 12v battery the voltage did SLOWLY CLIMB TO 16.2v (wow) which is why it needs to be monitored and NOT left connected indefinitely. For normal use 14.6v is the takeoff point when it should be removed. 14.4 to 14.6 is the correct voltage many automatic units peak at and let it drift down to a ~13.5 float/maintenance voltage. For an &#34;equalizing charge&#34; once every 3 months to keep the 6 cells, (2 volts nominal per cell) in sync, and to desulfate battery for longer life, let it go slightly over 15v for 30 to 60 minutes and remove (One thing an automatic charger won't let you do!) An occasional mild overcharge is desirable but for flooded batteries only, not for AGM or sealed batteries. Continuous overcharge is not good. A powerful charger can drive the voltage too high, too fast, depleting fluid level, eroding the positive plates and shortening life. Since lead-acid batteries generally take hours to absorb the final 20% of a healthy full charge, lower output is in your favor. For more LEAD-ACID BATTERY info visit &#34;batteryuniversity.com.&#34; If your battery is an AGM, sealed and/or non-spillable type, do yourself a favor and get a charger that is automatic, since sooner or later you'll forget and leave it on too long which will damage those.<br />  At 13v it showed 1.0 amp charge rate, 0.7 amp @ 14v, 0.5 amp @ 14.5v. With 2 screws removed and case opened there is a centrally located transformer and behind the 6/12v switch is a circuit board that includes the rectifier and automatic reset circuit breaker protection for the output.<br /> PROS- can attempt to charge a totally dead (0 volts) battery (as a safety feature, most newer automated chargers need a voltage threshold met to verify polarity before they will activate, therefore if it is totally dead they refuse to activate). Can even be used as a crude 6 and 12 volt power supply. Same 50amp clamps as other Schumachers and price was great. ($16.40)<br /> CONS- Fewer safety features, no indicator to let you know it's connected or charging, (unless you install your own). (Best to connect clamps before plug- first red to positive, black on negative, to prevent a spark that can potentially ignite hydrogen gas if present). Then plug in. Potential exists for overcharge if not monitored that can at best gas some electrolyte from battery or worse erode the plates over time. AGM type batteries a.k.a non-spillable sealed lead acid (SLA) are sensitive to overcharge and are easily damaged. Most powersport batteries are that type. A smaller battery (such as motorcycle size) is at greatest risk of being overcharged/ damaged by this thing if not monitored so if you want a SET-n-FORGET maintainer do not buy this, Buy an automatic for that purpose. (Battery Tender Jr $25and BatteryMinder 1510 $50 are 2 I'd recommend, there may be others but stay away from automatic Schumacher and Keyline products they have a flawed algorithm). Voltage is reduced via wire-wound transformer unlike the newer style switching adapters which means it is heavier, can only be used on 120v and is slightly less energy efficient though more reliable. Wanted one of these manual deals to fill in some of the gaps created by my automated chargers and it does. Would buy again, solid value.tic reset circuit breaker protection for the output.<br /> PROS- can attempt to charge a totally dead (0 volts) battery (as a safety feature, most newer automated chargers need a voltage threshold met to verify polarity before they will activate, therefore if it is totally dead they refuse to activate).

B000C2LNX4|5|Very good
B012E87QHU|5|I got these as a little gag gift for a pregnant friend. She says she won't put them on her car but her husband says he will put all three on his! haha They are a little smaller than I expected but still a nice size.  The magnetic part is strong and the colors are bright.  The black letters are bold enough to see from a distance. They are thick and made well. I think they are a great funny gift for a friend/family member.  I received this at a discounted rate in exchange of an honest review.
B008RPZWLC|5|Does what it is supposed to do
B00R6T0B8E|5|Great Product!
B00PYCXGQY|5|Very nice cutting pad, when used with a DA polisher and M105 you can get very good results
B002UC2ZCM|5|perfect fit for the sun platform on our pontoon boat, no more smashed fingers, VERY easy replacement
B0052UOTNC|1|This item was bought for my sons versa , highly disappointed we are , it failed to even come close to working ,  I had to give at least 1 star, it deserves zero, it's junk , I wasted money I'll never get back 👎👎👎
B0055OFA1A|5|this fit great! My cruiser is white w/black and gray interior we painted it the black and gray. very sporty!
B00B7FRN0C|5|Fits and functions just fine.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Covers easily and completely ..great for suvs
B0016KFWH4|5|Direct fit for my 2002 Chevy Suburban when wire to my brake controller. Easy wiring is great.
B005ZWAHE2|5|perfect , lowest setting is amazingly low , may scrub ur 250 tyre .
B000GTWXL4|5|I was pleased with the cable and the price
B00B7WW5CQ|2|They left the bolts loose and we're not in a  preset position no warning that they were left loose typically they are preset and tight the bolts holding the  mounting bolts this could result in a dangerous situation
B00GUF74HQ|5|Just got done installing this on my Ram 1500.  The instructions are good, however it was very beneficial to watch a few videos on youtube prior to performing the installation.  For instance, plugging the nut sert tool in first to the tail gate, then re-attaching your threading nut and doing your 3/4&#34; measurement (1st step).  Installing took about 20 minutes from start to finish, and that was while i followed along with a youtube video.  Once installed, the tailgate went down perfectly, nice and slow and controlled!  No binding on the cord against the hydraulic arm or any fitment issues.  There is no &#34;assist&#34; on putting the tail gate up just in case anyone is wondering, but not having to worry about the tailgate slamming down is awesome!  Should have come like this from the factory!
B00480BWCI|5|Nice levels blocks to level my RV. With 10 of these you don't need more.
B00F1ML182|5|I like
B00CUD74BS|5|Can't really rely on my post because I just installed them today but they sure do work. My stock shocks were blown and just replaced them today with the KYB shocks and my car is running smooth again. I would say better than stock.
B00H0ILNSS|5|I have one of these stickers on my rafting helmet and I get positive comments ALL the time from men and women rafting guides. It's great that there are 4 included so when they wear out I can replace.  I dont expect to replace too often since they are made of a plastic vs a paper sticker.
B00EY78606|5|Great solid toggle switch lights up nice and bright so far so good.
B0041TU2HW|5|Great product, excellent quality, perfect price. Cannot fault this product.
B008FSQ13O|2|The one I received did not seem to be what some others received.  I received a matte black emblem from China (appeared to ship internationally) with the white double sided tape (not 3M or 3M quality).  Also, the letter &#34;J&#34; is very short, not like in the picture or like the OEM emblem.  It was advertised as genuine Mopar and definitely is not.  I did give it 2 stars as it wasn't as bad as some other ones I have seen but the J being different and the white double sided tape was a deal killer for me.
B000ILI1BQ|1|Was not the right one I ordered, it fit well but still the wrong style
B00585FWI2|5|Fantastic, cute and speedy delivery.
B00D0IA5TU|5|Easy installation, went on without problem, works great!
B00SLYCNXE|5|BRIGHT is all I have to say.<br />I did have to turn the bulbs ( reverse ) to get them to turn on.
B001GOLA5I|5|I Absolutely Love this License Plate Representing My Favorite Football Team!! Makes Me Happy To Have My Office Decorated with NY Giants Logos Everywhere!!!
B001I9JKJ4|5|My bug shade looks great.
B001FCB11O|5|great product
B00JXLH7CG|5|Works fine and solves the LED replacement bulb problem. I was afraid the new solid statement unit would not click but it does.
B005ZHFXKU|5|IT work very good ,THIS SYSTEM is EXCELLENT FOR MY AUTO, (YOU HAVE A BLESS DAY )
B00QE5AQLI|5|It started my 2000 Dodge Dakota without a problem. Charges my phone really quick!
B0002KR88A|5|aok
B0013FFFIS|5|Worked great
B000E471YK|5|Works perfectly!
B000C7YQ9M|5|Works great
B005C5A1PM|5|Genuine Yamaha replacement part. This is the newer version that replaces the original petcock for my 1980 Yamaha XJ650 Maxim (XJ650G) Super simple swap, fits perfectly and looks similar to the original. Price is right, less than a complete rebuild kit for the original petcock.
B00PGBUC10|5|Love the badge
B006DXWHHM|1|It is a defective compressor. Brought it to a reputable garage to have it installed by a very experienced mechanic. It would not engage so we brought it to another reputable garage that deals only with foreign cars to see why it wasn't engaging. They tested it and found that the compressor was defective. Very disappointed! Especially as we still had to pay the mechanic for his labor(not his fault). We certainly expect a full refund on this item!
B006N95KPC|4|THis part was installed without major issues and is functioning as it should.
B00IZNZOYQ|4|Works well, just as I thought.  Saving plenty of money doing oil changes on the Camry myself.
B0014BEQ54|5|easy fit. easy to replace. appears well made. will use again.
B00Y75QZD0|5|One of the USB ports did not seem to be working. The seller immediately replaced the unit.  Love the convenience of being able to plug several items into my older car that does not have the multiple USB outlets of newer vehicles.
B000HZRTDE|5|Holds all the manuals, insurance & registration papers, small writing pad & pen and still had room. I would recommend it.
B002XQOOQA|1|I wouldn't buy these stupid locks if I were you. Ye,s it's very affordable but the quality sucks big time!
B00BD55Y52|5|Fits my 2015 Toyota Corolla Perfectly!
B00IAA8VI0|4|I like it, put it on the back window of my truck cab, just wanted something simpleto compliment my license plate &#34;WOLFHWL&#34;!
B0006Z9SPW|5|Restored body siding beautifully.
B00KD3GWSI|5|Delivered when promised.<br />Looks good, and took me about 30 min.  to install. Fit was a bit close but I installed it over the factory cover to keep the padding.
B00JTUBTU2|4|Vehicle used: 2000 Dodge Caravan at 148.8xx miles<br /><br />Off the top of my head I'm not sure what filter I used with this, just that 1,000 miles later the oil on the dipstick kept coming up clean and the engine didn't use any oil in that period of time. I may have to switch to a heavier weight oil though, on long 100-200 mile runs the vehicle still used up oil once I got somewhere past 1,200 miles. Any ideas? I thought of switching to 0w40 for summer use.
B005VAV1QQ|5|Best pads u can buy. Arrived the 3rd day. Will buy again.
B000N9N398|1|Product description is inaccurate.  It has a smaller internal bearing than Mercury assembly 19291A3, and will not accept the propshaft from my 3 cylinder mercury which the product description says is applicable.
B00VJ2AKX0|5|Good product.Fast delevery
B0002JMEJ4|5|Works as promised.
B000786GLM|5|Very good quality
B004ZIXM7G|5|Bought FOR MY 1999-00 YAMAHA R1 AND JUST INSTALLED IT CAME ON TIME LIKE USUAL. AND CAME WITH TO DECALS TO PUT ON BIKE . HEAD'S UP IF YOU SPROCKET YOUR BIKE UP TWO TEETH YOU NEED TO ADD 2-LINKS TO CHAIN SO YOU HAVE SLACK. MY CHAIN IS 114-LINK I BOUGHT A.  116-LINK blue CHAIN. Must to make fit perfect. All in all great product Thankyou guys John.an.jenn
B000EDUUHQ|5|Love these cupboard bars for supporting my bookshelves at work. They sell for a reasonable price and arrived in a timely fashion!
B0035B013W|4|I love it, although it arrived a little scratched up.  When I put it on my car, however, it was hardly noticeable at all.  This coupled with my Dark Knight floor mats have made my little Honda into a cool little ride!
B000BZD3EY|5|This part worked out as expected. The best replacement Thank You !
B00473V3ZM|5|They fit nice and look great. I've had many compliments on them.
B00FF1K7BQ|4|Then new car scent is a must buy!!! I have tried everything but my car really smells new. Not so happy with the leather scent.
B00SBZRKEU|5|I LOVE THIS TERAPUMP JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY 4 LONMORES. A GREAT BUY FOR THE MONEY.
B000V5K8DI|2|I just received a can of the &#34;orange&#34; paint.  The top of the can has a small blotch of paint as a sample of the color outcome.<br />Unfortunately, the color is drastically different than what is pictured on Amazon.  The &#34;orange&#34; I received is much more red<br />than orange pictured.  I will contact the manufacturer and will update my review if I either got a bad batch or if there is a<br />quality control issue with their paints.
B00HCOXZT0|3|Sensors are fine, work great on my truck with our 5th wheel. Instrument interface is mediocre, and it cries out for a smartphone app.
B009PF8EYK|4|Work fine, a little over charged compared to what came with the vehicle. So they hood raises rather quick.
B00UME7GWY|5|I am not 100% sure, but these look, mont and feel just like the Harley OEM bar. Chrome is flawless and installation was a breeze.
B009P8A044|4|Easy to install
B009YCTIWQ|2|Shipping and transactions were great, product just wasn't very bright. The leds say pink but they are more of a whitish purple... Not really wanting to use them for the motorcycle they were intended for.
B00V3XFFE4|5|Get you one! Love it....no more digging out a phillips head screwdriver everytime I get take my seat off.
B004LEYIHW|5|Just changed oil in 2014 gmc Denali. Much smoother right away! Truck has 40000 on it so it's still new but the dexos oils suck.noticed less valve train noise . Will keep using motul in future!!!
B009AGY7IQ|5|I received this really fast. The frame is very sturdy and the lettering looks great. I only wish the lettering was &#34;engraved&#34; on the frame... its just letters applied to the frame.  It's on the rear plate... so its holding up nicely.  I would purchase again!
B006RJP4MC|5|They are stickers, they stick. Need I say more.
B0000TQGQS|5|Perfect fit and excellent construction.
B00SD2K2NC|1|These bulbs are made too big for any h1 housing .you wonder why even manufacture something they know won't fit
B00LHVUGXM|5|Perfect for rv. Keeps both batteries at right levels assuming you top each off before storage
B001C6JCTQ|5|To think such a small item is integral to proper functioning of a motor vehicle.  Saved $$$$$$ by purchasing and doing a self install (only recommended for those who have the necessary skill).<br />Recommend checking Amazon for parts and accessories for your vehicle if you DIY.  Also, if you have a friendly mechanic, try buying your part from Amazon, and just pay or installation
B00ECTQTWI|4|a good buy
B00GJKXW8M|5|I would buy some more  of them
B005ZCJ7P2|4|So it fits my 2011 Black hyundai limited turbo, with signal/heated. I only needed to replace my driver side. It matches the BLACK paint perfectly. Obvious differences when looking into the mirror. and i can personally tell that it is after market. Still looks great though. will upload pic if needed
B0009ZEVHY|5|Easy to install,perfect fit.
B0050HZ19S|5|02 Grand prix w/3.1 put about 5,000 miles on, works fine.
B00IYHK8Z8|1|They where broken when I got them junk and very unhappy with them and the people who sold them to me
B00K9ZAEFM|5|Excellent. Fit exactly like the original.
B003BZD08U|5|Works great
B001O07VI4|4|works great for a stubborn tire that requires this special tool to remove it
B0059JGTQG|5|Awesome product, worked as intended
B007IGTUYQ|5|Awesome
B00MINH13G|2|When it rains the switch fills up with water. Had to drill a small hole in the lowest point of the housing for the water to drain and after had to spray with contact cleaner to get the switches to work again.
B004A6PLSG|5|Works as expected,easy to install and came in a timely manner. Fit as advertised and am overall satisfied.
B006UY7I50|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B00VXDYMXY|3|Cheap but ok
B005PZMKZI|4|These fit nice and look great when you follow the directions on how to install correctly.  Headrest covers did not though.  I ended up sewing these to fit nicer.  (our Optima headrests are small, so may fit other vehicles better).  Overall, very pleased especially for the price!
B00DZ358AQ|5|Fit great.  Started bike up great and continues to work well.
B003O0WA2E|5|Went on easy, just like new! Replace yours yourself and save $$$
B0074U7S9U|5|Great Product and Fast Service!
B0050I9P0S|5|Great DVD,, just like a chopper,real minimalist, he talks about and shows just what you need to to see and know.  Mic
B000CNJG5U|4|just what I needed
B012BOE3DC|5|This magnetic sign is perfect for someone who doesn't like the traditional &#34;baby on board&#34; sign. My husband refused to use the usual sign in his eondow, and he absolutely loves this one! So funny, and it's a super strong magnet, so it sticks well to his jeep. I did receive a discount on this item, in exchange for my honest opinion, and I have done just that. I love it!
B007KPUNVO|5|I loved the design, it fits perfectly, highly recommended
B002ZS4QCS|3|The hooks fit around the headrest post and hold my purse/totes while I'm driving.  Sometimes I hear them clinking when I'm driving and nothing is hanging on them.  The hook is very thing so I'm not sure how long they will last, but they have been fine for normal use for almost three months.
B0012S9A5U|4|Can't do the job without the right tool. I tried before I bought this to no avail.
B003XJ1ZK4|5|Worked great right out of the box.  Used it on RV tires at about 110 pounds and the gage was consistent.
B011H0MSPQ|5|Relays work well, wire gauge is a little small for high amperage applications but as long as you plan for that these should work well for you.  Also the color code could be better thought out since they have Black connected to +12V and White to GND but it comes with a diagram and its easy to figure out.  Overall I would buy these again if I needed a few prewired relays and sockets.
B004DHN8FU|5|Love it
B000CMJ6HO|1|Video didn't show a heat gun step, this stuff gets fingers (air strips) like I don't know what, misleading, awful. I wanted to cry by the time I gave up trying to remove the air.
B00KLFZ5ZY|4|a little longer than the ones in our trailer but worked
B00C59TR76|5|Fit true to size. Great venting. Riding in 100+ degree weather.  Also bought the pants. Very happy.
B00B9FEN9E|1|product does not work on 2006 Mercury Grand Marquis as stated. it will not work at all and cannot get money back.
B00HTOB0NG|5|works great
B0002MABGE|1|My 25 pound dog literally destroyed this on the first use. She just bent the bars and slipped right through as soon as we put her in the car.  Complete waste of money. Unless you have a 5lb dog that never try's to get through or come up to the front anyway, don't bother with this.
B00684TAYY|5|Great. Fit
B00M0QD8T2|5|Love my silverado sticker. Fast shipping, good quality. Will order from theses guys again :)
B001A0F8VA|5|installed fairly easily, did have one of four rings stick and noticed what looked like a fish etching under the ring. Compaired to other three and found that the fish on the sticking ring was facing the rear of the truck where others faced the front. Reversed the problem ring and worked fine.
B0002SQU9K|5|Works!
B00BQE609O|5|Very bright lights. You have to put 3 m automotive trim adhesive on them if you want to stick them some where, as they have none.
B00M9NXUHG|5|Easy to put together works well in tight<br />Spaces.
B000I1KJT8|5|Long needed this set makes the removal and installation of clamps a breeze
B001KLX73K|1|Ball Diameter = 2 5/16&#34;<br />Shank Diameter = 1 /4&#34;<br />Shank Length = 2 3/4&#34;<br />Gross Load = 30,000 lbs.
B007TY5MLC|5|Easy to install and quick shipping
B000COB5LM|5|As advertised.
B00E9E76F0|5|I've tried half a dozen wheel cleaning brushes and this one is the most expensive but by far the best!  It gets ALL the way back on Audi 8.5&#34; wheels through 5 spoke 17&#34; wheels and even cleans the wheel rim outside of the brake caliper.  It does splash a little bit on you when you pull it out but that can be minimized with the hose spray on it as you pull it out.
B00IOERAJ8|1|product does NOT fit Ducati 996 as advertised!!
B000CN5NBG|3|We are Happy with the SIze and Width of these Visors.<br />We are Unhappy that we seem to be having problems keeping them in the window.<br />Finally resorted to using double sided tape--which defeated the purchase to begin with.
B003RFCH74|3|Works okay., Installed this on a 2009 ER6N Kawasaki, I was expecting more out of this but still good for the price. By design the seat is inclined towards the tank and narrow, so there  is not much cruiser pad can do. more expensive option would be going for corbin seats. Air Flow underneath is not very noticeable. Installation is easy.
B001KSCF0E|5|Thanks
B000EVYGZA|4|I am just a Do-It-Yourselfer, so this is perfect. I had a $9.95 cheapy deluxe and that went t**s up in a matter of months. This is perfect for simple household and shade tree mechanic uses. Why only 4 stars then; because on my best day I can only do 3 star work on my house and I don't have any idea what this meter is really capable of.
B006RYSBAY|3|Bought it for my son but it looked too girly for his car.
B007CX6DWC|5|Very nice engine delivered on time runs great easy to deal with
B0068EQG50|3|They seem fine, but my mechanic refused to use them. He felt this brand was inferior. I have no idea if that is true, but he didn't use them.
B00XY60TDU|1|Not really because it broken
B00B2PYFKS|3|Front mats fits perfect but the rears are not made for it . If I knew i would of bought the //M performance ones instead.
B00OTZ1KDI|5|Great product, all my firefighter friends are going to get one.
B008D8LZBE|5|Been riding for over 40 years thiis the most comfortable helmet I have ever owned.  GREAT price too.
B004FD371C|5|Worked perfectly on my 08 Suburban!
B000CNC6A2|5|All good.. great product. fast shipping
B00BFU0YKK|1|Failed in 2 weeks. Item is junk, all moving internal parts are plastic!! Made to fall apart and fail. Stay away. Shameful how quality and reliability has been &#34;thrown away&#34; just to enhance the bottom line!!  The VW camper had a faucet pump, it's at least 30 years old and it still works!!
B00IIVUXLO|2|Didn't easily adapt to my vechile
B0041MCLW8|5|Was a 100 bucks at my auto parts store and at this price plus free shipping it is a great deal. I put it on my wife's car over a year ago and no problems. Install isn't bad, the hardest part is getting the old bearing off
B00306OYV2|5|nice four wheeler
B00OTRLG76|4|These are thinner than the ones from the automotive supply company but do the job.  For the price, would buy again
B000BYGFDQ|5|excelent
B000CF6RZU|5|Works and fits well on my 96' Ranger Single cab. Easy to install and looks good. Living in Florida where it rains all the time and gets very hot inside vehicles this allows you to open them slightly without any rain getting in and allows the car to stay cooler.
B00061SGZO|5|Looks like a good set and is quite complete.  Nice case to keep them neat.  I have not used any of it yet, but will report on the strength and when I change the next set of ball joints.
B00LIC29H6|5|Use this oil on my VVTI 1JZ in all changes.  Does NOT break down under hard, hot abuse unlike 10w30 mobil 1 which Ive had engine failure with, holds up great.
B00BPZ30R4|5|It fit perfect. Car is up and burning rubber! Thank you!
B00A7VPIEK|5|Working great so far.
B001FL1CY6|5|Excellent
B007ZFXH0I|5|So much cheaper than the local dealer prices. I purchased everything I needed here on Amazon and saved more than $500.00 over our local Yamaha dealers prices. It was a little bit of a challenge getting the original screws out. Had to gently tap them with an old hinge pin from a door with a hammer all around the edges of the screws and then they broke loose. Patience is the key !
B0031I2SKS|5|Great quality and price
B001FJWCZG|1|I purchased an entire exhaust assembly from Walker using one of the parts diagrams on their site made specifically for my car.  Little did I know that they don't even offer one of the parts labelled on the diagram, so the assembly didn't even fit right.  What's the point of buying specific assembly parts if you're going to need to cut custom pipe just to get the bloody thing to work?
B007UVSJMS|5|I love my Doberman and this sticker helps me let the world know it! Almost 2 months and still looking great on my rear window.
B009YRI64C|5|I received this really fast, and have had people stop me in the grocery store parking lot to tell me how much they liked it!

B005YXDUB4|5|Easy to install in vacant tail light aperture.  5 minutes at most.
B000COCU5W|5|9005 should be the bulb for the &#34;high-beam&#34; position on your headlights (9006 is the one for the low-beam position), and the light provided by these &#34;SilverStar&#34; bulbs it is substantially whiter/brighter, with greater depth of illumination, than the &#34;standard&#34; Sylvania bulb of the same size/configuration.  The whiter/brighter the light coming from your headlights, the more detail your eyes can pick up in everything the light reaches as you drive.  I used the standard bulbs for many years, and just finally decided I wanted to try the brighter ones.  I like this solution because it requires no modification of my car's OE ... just different bulbs in the OE headlamp assembly.  So far, I'm very pleased with the difference, and consider these &#34;SilverStar&#34; bulbs well worth the extra money.  With that said, I agree with the reviewer who said there probably isn't enough difference between this &#34;entry level&#34; SilverStar bulb, and the &#34;Ultra&#34; to justify the added cost for the latter.<br /><br />I didn't use rubber gloves to install them, but only because I had no trouble removing them from the blister packaging and putting them into my particular headlight assembly (2001 Chevy Suburban) without touching any part of the metal base or bulb surface.  If your particular application/car makes touching of these surfaces more likely when you're installing them, then use the gloves.  I guess only time will tell how long they'll last, but I think they'll last at least as long as they're rated (about a year), and probably a lot longer than that for me, because I think I do less night driving than most people.
B000BZEIW0|4|This part fixed my engine light code for bad upstream O2 sensor so my car passed inspection. It came with anti seize grease already applied to the threaded and installed in just a few minutes. It did not have a new engine clip on the wire however so I had to reuse the old one which was not easy to get off. Also the box was in an envelope and was completely crushed but the sensor was not damaged.

B0131VORGW|1|Well the saying is a great one, unfortunately it is impossible to get it transferred onto a laptop top, car, etc. because the letters don't all come off -- this is even after attempting to apply the decal several times.<br /><br />In addition, it is overpriced for the quality of the item.  I was really disappointed!  :o(
B00KJGPN2K|5|For the record, this would be a 4.5 star item for me, but I've rounded up here.  (Which is what I alluded to in the title for this review)<br /><br />Over the last year I've been through a Sena SMH5 (no FM), then later an SMH5-FM and then later a Cardo Scala Rider G9x before circling back around to get this product (20S-01).  I've liked all of the above, though each of the previous devices had something missing here or there that led me to swap one for the next (typically passing the older devices down to another rider who might be able to make some use of the device).<br /><br />I liked the SMH5.  It was fairly simplistic, but worked well enough for me to listen to music on or answer phone calls with while riding.  I would note that I didn't have a lot of success with voice commands for it, but using the Jog dial was easy enough to get the hang of.<br /><br />I upgraded later to the SMH5-FM because I wanted to be able to listen to &#34;live music&#34; over the radio, or get sports talk or news talk to catch up on current events.  That device worked well in the end, but I encountered some issues with it that originated from the TomTom Rider 2013 device that I paired it with (when I selected the sound &#34;none&#34; for alerts I didn't realize it was going to flip to silence for some period of time.  I assumed that none meant no alert sounds and no interruption of other audio that I might be listening to).  I didn't determine the source of that problem until after I had upgraded again, to the Cardo Scala Rider G9x.  With that device in use I was able to test things out more and link the alerts that the TomTom device was putting out back to the seemingly dropped audio.<br /><br />I liked the G9x but... it suffers from a lack of LOUDNESS in the audio.  It does boost the loudness with AGC (Automatic Gain Control) that is keyed to noise and speed, but when it does boost the audio it winds up garbling it a bit, or making it hard to determine what you are actually hearing.  Think of a speaker that was turned up too loud and just can't handle the volume level you are tasking it with.  Outside of that issue, I also found myself wanting the Sena Jog dial control again, versus the button arrangement that the G9x uses.  Oh, one other fault with that device is the lack of an available remote control (where one is available for this device).<br /><br />Now, this device isn't without issues for me.  The voice commands definitely worked with the G9x.  I was able to make enough noise to wake it up easily (typically by using the word &#34;Radio&#34; in a reasonably stern voice) and then could give it a command that it understood and completed.  I've not had similar success with the 20S, but do intend to practice more with it and fine tune it (if possible) to get it to respond better when I want it to.<br /><br />That leads me to another quibble with this device, and that is one that I've seen with all of the Sena products that included FM Radio (the products that I have tried).  The setting for using RDS to help &#34;lock in&#34; stations is apparently backwards, at least for my usage.  With that setting on the radio tends to &#34;drift&#34; and starts scanning around on the FM dial to find another station rather than actually sticking with the station that I was listening to and locking in that signal.  In fact, if I turn off the RDS functionality and just let the static and fuzz come through occasionally the signal locks much better and never drifts to another station.<br /><br />I would note a similar not quite as expected functionality with the use of the handlebar remote that I paired with this device, but that will show up in a review of that remote control when I get an opportunity to write it.<br /><br />The FM audio and other audio levels definitely reach a higher volume level without getting ruined (when compared to the G9x as an example).  The FM station range is reasonably close to the G9x as well, and as a big advantage, the Sena products don't come with concerns about gray market purchases that the Cardo Products seem to make an issue of for purchasers that didn't purchase directly from an authorized retailer (which the big A to Z retailer here is not).<br /><br />Oh, one other area where I would have to acknowledge that Cardo seems to have an edge compared to Sena is with their supporting smartphone application.  Probably just personal tastes, but I found I liked the Cardo app better compared to Sena's.  I somewhat assume that eventually the Sena app will offer the same things that I like in the Cardo app, and may even be an improvement over the Cardo app.  That's an area where the healthy competition should lead to improvement.<br /><br />So, this isn't quite perfect, but is awfully nice (from my perspective) and is a device that I absolutely love having.  Being able to listen to the radio, or take phone calls is really nice.  Made even better with the handlebar remote control (though that device isn't quite perfect for me).  4.5 stars if possible.  Rounded up to 5 if not. ;-)roducts don't come with concerns about gray market purchases that the Cardo Products seem to make an issue of for purchasers that didn't purchase directly from an authorized retailer (which the big A to Z retailer here is not).<br /><br />Oh, one other area where I would have to acknowledge that Cardo seems to have an edge compared to Sena is with their supporting smartphone application.

B00FSG8224|1|This is my second set of these, and if I could give them zero stars, I would.  The first set failed after three months of light us.  After I installed the news ones, rows of the lights started failing after 10 minutes if use.  These are very very poor quality lights.
B007H2PYVE|1|This chair is without a doubt the most uncomfortable chair I've ever tried to sit in. It is absolute junk and I'm thinking of throwing in the trash. Why not it's just taking up space. Don't buy one!

B0062IWPY8|5|I have always used genuine BMW oil filters. They are not expensive, plus they come with both replacement O rings and brass washer for drain plug. Some places you should never go cheap. At approx. $15 this is one of those places.

B001G6M1BS|5|Just finished installing this in my 2003 Protege5 5 speed to replace my broken OEM mount. It's not oil filled like the OEM mount is but it still fits and works great. It DOES fit 5 speed motors despite what the product description says.
B00FX9UCNI|5|Good bars easy to install
B0002ILK4K|5|This battery powers my 1982 Yamaha XT200J just fine, though it doesn't fit in the plastic battery box.  I made a leather pouch for it to dangle in and it works just fine.
B010FUJFUU|5|Well worth the money and got it very fast.
B00MC72Q1K|5|I had previously tried another set of LED tail/brake lamps only to find out the polarity of the lamps was wrong for my 1989 Toyota Land Cruiser (FJ62). The lamps from JDM ASTAR are not only the proper polarity, they are also a real improvement over the 1157 incandescent lamps normally used in this vehicle.<br /><br />The lamps are well-made, and the fit was perfect in the FJ62's taillight assembly. I initially installed only one lamp, in order to compare the LED's brightness and visibility compared to the incandescent lamp that remained on the opposite side of the truck. In bright, mid-morning sun, the LED appeared to be at least 1.5X-2X brighter than the old 1157s.<br /><br />Where these lamps really shine is in overall visibility. The LED lamp has both end and side LEDs, and that meant the the entire area of the taillight lens was more brightly lit, compared with the old incandescents which only produce a hot-spot in the center and a dim glow over the rest of the lens.<br /><br />Finally, when the brakes are applied, the intensity difference is considerable, and the entire taillight lens glows brightly. For an older vehicle with relatively small taillight area and no high-mounted brake lamp, this makes a huge difference.<br /><br />Highly recommended. I'll be looking for equivalent LEDs from this seller for my turn signals and backup lamps.
B004XN87YG|1|I used this bag once and when I got home I noticed the strap broke while I was on the highway. I don't feel safe ever using it again.
B00CA984XO|5|Just got my wheel extensions worked great and they shipped in less then 8 hours and received them in two days thanks great product
B00GJZ2AVC|5|Fantastic helmet. Light, comfortable and great vision. The modular aspect is spectacular. Sizing seems about right on the button. Only gripe is it is a bit louder than anticipated, but that is negated by the plus column on this wonderful product.
B000CC4O58|5|We have used deer whistles for over 20 years.  It would be great if all cars had them..We would have less animals dead in the road, and on the side of the road.
B001U9BMD4|1|Wow these are huge way bigger than pictured. Gaudy even. Kind of disappointed, I had bought this set before and was happy but this time these are just ridiculous for a bumper sticker.
B000IHK1VI|5|Awesome, the only way to refill your cooling system! Don't have to mess with 'burping' and other methods to get all of the air out of the system. Oh, and you don't need a large air compressor either, my 2 gal. 1.5 HP Craftsman pulled the vacuum down to more than 25 in very rapidly on my late model sports car. Then, the vacuum quickly pulls the fresh coolant into the system with no air remaining. Just be sure to turn up the regulator to 90 plus lbs output air pressure. You may have to draw the vacuum down in several steps with a small tank compressor, allowing the compressor to 'catch up' and fill the tank again. Also, this economy unit works exactly the same as the more expensive units, it is perfect for us DIY'ers. Cheers
B00A6TAJGK|5|The steps were easy to install on our 1994 Fifth Wheel!  So easy to operate and just what was needed.
B00N9NRLKW|5|excelent!!
B006CRT72W|1|It didn't work. Would have cost us more to ship it back for a refund than what we paid.
B00B1HM7YI|1|your website does not work for me.<br />other websites do work for me. I can find a part and pay for that part from their site.<br />your site will let me enter a vehicle but will not let me find a part for that vehicle or pay for a part.
B00K9BGO78|5|small but love them
B008G2XRYU|5|They were a great fit. Installed in less than 15 minutes. Their customer service was wonderful. I would not hesitate buying from them again.
B003SKCARK|4|Works splendidly! Had mistakenly used a Kiwi waterproofer on my clarks, it dried small patches, I used LP on them, and good as new! I also used it on my worn Palladiums, it made them look completely refreshed.
B003VFNZEY|5|I have just one word to describe these glasses - AWESOME!
B008JQAD5Y|3|It is OK but the hole in the small end is undersize and would not fit over the shoulder of the bolt it mounts on.  Fortunately I had the correct size bit and was able to drill it out. Big concern, did I void and warranty should it fail.  Bottom line, if you want a fit, form, function replacement, this isn't it.
B00S09T8M4|5|Made car washing easy! I hope it lasts for a while and it's soft to the touch.

B004MTK39S|4|I'm writing this review as well as one on the OTC brand axle nut wrench. Check that review here as well.<br /><br />This Pit Posse wrench was purchased to help with the rear wheel service of my 2010 Harley Ultra Limited land yacht motorcycle. The wrench is 11 1/2&#34; in length, versus the one from OTC, that comes in at 7 3/4&#34;. The Pit Posse has a 3/8ths square drive hole a bit over 2&#34; from the center of the 36mm 6 point wrench end. The OTC is approximately 6&#34; from the center of the 12 point hole, and is a 1/2&#34; drive square hole. The Pit Posse has a nice rubber coating with a slightly pebble finish that may aid in gripping if your hands are a bit greasy. Not sure about how the coating will last, as the wrench slightly tapers in width, so if the rubber sleeve moves a little while using, it will probably lose its grip on the wrench body, and slide off. But for this job, it worked great. The wrench is approximately 1/4&#34; thick, versus the OTCs 5/16&#34; thickness. The body is clearly marked with the 36mm size, as well as a small Pit Posse logo.<br /><br />I was hoping that with the additional length of this wrench versus the shorter OTC, that I'd be able to loosen the axle nut without removal of the muffler. No such luck. It's added length and 6 point head meant it jammed on the muller body and didn't want to turn as easily as the shorter 12 point more position able OTC wrench. Where this Pit Posse worked better than the OTC, was its ability to hold the opposing side of the axle while the nut was tightened on the other end. As I mentioned in my review of the OTC offering, the Pit Posse has a slightly larger OD on the wrench end, that while maybe increasing the strength slightly, it meant the OD would hit the belt tension cam stop on the swing arm.
B008KZKJ9O|3|Fits my 2015 Hyundai Tucson perfectly and is attractive. However, it is extremely light weight and the outer lip that is supposed to keep liquids on the mat if they spill bends easily . It is also very slick and things slide around more so than they do on the carpet. For keeping the cargo carpet clean it is probably fine but if I had it to do over I would get something heavier with a more rubber feel to keep things from sliding so easily.
B00JIEX722|3|As advertised, the led is extremely bright compare to normal LED.  However, I got 2 defective lights and had them to replace.
B000XQ8OP4|5|Attached to the back bumper of my silver Infiniti.  Color matches perfectly.  I guess I was lucky color matches so well.  Looks like part of the car or something that comes stock w/bumper.  With 3M tape it seems quite secure.  It's been through 2 car washes and so far so good.  Maybe only time will tell if it holds up for years.  But price is low enough I would buy again to replace if need be.  I live in a congested area driving in stop and go freeway traffic.  Have had lots of back fender bumps in the past.  These two pads on the back add a nice layer of protection for low speed bumps.  So far very satisfied with these two bumper pads.
B001EOV3B6|2|This receiver fit the rails fine, but the two bumper holes (M14 X 2) were off about an 1&#34; or so height and length ...  Sawed the flange off.....Mounted  flange to the underside of bumper, attached with capscrews and spacers, welded in place........This was not a 40 minute job.....I guess this is the way it was &#34;head-n west&#34;........C.

B00NFA4VW0|5|Quality kit that doesnt kill your wallet. H4 BiBeam **FUTURE BUYERS** this kit has an extra part to install unlike the basic single beam kit, It is a relay connected to the wire harness, You have to mount it, ground it and connect it to your battery.  It comes with an attached fuse. You also have ground tails sticking out of the bulbs. Eveything is in nice wire loom.  Bought 3 sets total and they all lasting so far...  As for the people leaving 1 star reviews- the true reason their kit failed was most likely INSTALLER ERROR   Here is some fyi's -DONT touch the  bulb with your finger, it can burn out the bulb, your finger leaves oil residue on the buld. It will heat up when the bulb is energized and cause a hot spot on the bulb causing the filament to blow -DONT install in wheel wells -DONT use zip ties/tie wraps to mount it. It can get damaged internally by road vibration from driving unless you screw/bolt it down so that its solid and cant move. -BEST to try and mount it somewhere dry -BEST to silicone seams if mounting to somewhere that sees water from time to time (nothing fancy , cheap waterproof  silicone from the local hardware store or a wallmart is fine)  Its all common sence,   But common  sence aint so common
B00C1GG4YW|5|Great quality comes with rubber backing so not to damage the paint.  Wish it came with black fasteners but I painted mine
B010N7RW2S|1|Complete Junk.  I had it for five days.  100% charged.  Worked one time to start my Ford F15, then tried jump stating the same truck an hour later and it wouldn't work.  Shows 100% charged still.  I have another brand called Power All that has worked flawlessly.  The Power All looks like much more inferior product.  Specially the jumpers...  But it works well.  I'll have to by another Power All if I want reliability. I think its important to note that some of the most favorable reviews on this unit are people who got it FREE to give a review?   Kind of shoddy if you ask me.

B005QW6S8K|1|Brakes started to squeak after two weeks
B000EAIERW|4|Very solid grip handle. The handle is a little big that's why I gave it 4 stars. Other wise it's great stays in place and easy to install.
B000C2SAO4|3|This does not correctly fit a 1995 Geo Prizm Base with the 1.6L with an auto transmission. Specifically, while you can get it on, the slight bend in the middle causes it to  contact the fan bracket. The oem hose does not have this bend in the middle. As you can see in the first photo, they are nearly identical from one angle. But when viewed at a different angle they are different. Enough to not work in my opinion  Edit:  The correct lower hose is Gates 22271
B003DPRTWG|5|I have a 2013 king quad 750 and honestly I hardly write reviews but this was well worth it. If you want something heavy duty when your cruising through the woods and your smacking into large brush or small trees trust me you want the bison front bumper. If you have a king quad and you actually put it to the test like I do you will soon come to realize that front plastic garbage will fall apart in a day and you'll have to zip tie it down. I put this bad boy on, perfect fit and it doesn't get better than this thing. First thing I did was go out and plow into a tree to test it out and it does not phase this bumper. Great quality and great service.
B00HUM5EWU|2|I like the shade, but I expected it to completely cover the window. There are about 3 inches of window exposed on both sides of my 2015 CRV. It also hangs a couple of inches below the rearview mirror.
B00ZVMSMCK|3|Cracked during installation just like the other reviewer said. It cracks when you tighten the bolts down to the body, but it's still kinda strong so it's not really that bad. Would've/Should've bought a different one. Took the risk of buying it when it had no reviews.
B00BOEFEPC|5|The bottom plastic panel with rubber studs needs to be pulled away from its position to full upright. It's stiff and needs more than expected effort to lift. From the available pictures its not obvious to figure this out. It's a snug fit in my 2008 Nissan versa sedan. Perfect, exactly what I was looking for.
B00J622WMM|5|helmet is very nice, fits well and comfortable to wear... the googles are a joke! they literally look like they came from the toy department at the dollar store!... just plane goofy, but overall the helmets nice & a good buy for the price...
B00KTIQU3E|5|They both programmed easily and Ace Hardware cut them for me for free.  Just what I needed.
B001LHVOVK|5|great product works every time I'm able to look up my code without paying some garage to do it
B009X23XY6|5|I have to admit I had to read the instructions several times before I was sure on how to set these up.  But once I was sure I had it figured out I set the deflators up to my specs (18 psi for beach driving), they worked GREAT.  I would guess to get from 38 psi to 18 psi took about 90 seconds.  My husband offered to help when he got back from the store...by the time he got back I had everything done.
B001G6HKXC|3|The filter is too thick and does not fit my 2001 Volvo V70. Also, this filter has only 27 folds while the OEM filter has 45 folds (more folds = more effective filtration).

B00G5RTYYK|5|These reflective tape strips look amazing on my blue Ninja 650! They are bright, and reflect nicely whenever light hits them. The best part is I thought these would only look good at night. Boy was I wrong! The blue strips complement my bike greatly and actually give my boring black rims some color even in daylight. They are easy to install and just look fantastic. What's cool is they also include four 1 inch wide circle stickers and four star shaped stickers you can stick on your bike or helmet. A couple of things I discovered when putting these on:<br /><br />-Make sure your rims are clean before installing. I used aluminum rim cleaner and a damp paper towel to remove all the dirt/brake dust from my rims and then wiped clean with a dry rag.<br />-Be patient! These are easy to install given that there is no disassembly required of your bike, but it does take some time getting used to because you have to carefully align the curved tape strips with your rim in order to make it form a perfect circle. Once you have one edge aligned simply run your finger along the tape and it should conform to the rim curvature as long as your aren't pulling tight on the strip.<br />-Once you start to run into the frame bars, simply pop your bike into Neutral and roll forward to expose the other half of your rim before you start the next piece of tape.<br />-Do not overlap the strips more than 1/4 inch around your rim as explained in the directions. When done carefully you should have 1 to 2 strips remaining which you can stick somewhere else on your bike or your helmet for additional protection.<br />-When looking up close if it looks like you haven't made a PERFECT circle, don't panic. I thought this at first but then stood back and you can't even tell once your eyes are more than two feet away. Once you look at it standing up they look to form around the rim quite nicely. Just try to line up the edges of the tape as best as possible and you should be fine.<br />-My installation timewas around 45 minutes to an hour but that's including cleaning all four sides of my rims.<br /><br />Like I said this is a fantastic product that looks amazing and super easy to install. Not to mention $40 dollars is a small price to pay when it comes to saving your life. These will definitely help other drivers see you at night without having to install an expensive light kit. I would definitely buy more if my bike had more wheels. Thank you customTAYLOR33! Photos coming soon :)
B00JSJMV38|2|The cover is well made and fit my 2015 Honda Fit wheel like a glove.  As others have said, there is a strong smell.  In addition to the smell - I also had a kind of allergic reaction.  I got nasal congestion after driving and even worse, I drove home and forgot to wash my hands before eating dinner with my hands & my mouth broke out in bumps.
B007D5DB88|5|Easy hookup and works great.
B001UEHLV6|5|Perfect fit. So far, no issues. Air smells cleaner.
B0068OYZ9O|5|Just what I hoped I would get. Worked great!
B0009Y2CFS|2|Hardly gets even warm
B000XBBIRA|4|good but somewhat expensive
B0043DYCAY|5|I’m swapping engines on my 1990 Chevy K2500 350 5.7L and needed to replace the exhaust from the engine to the muffler… the rest was replaced not too long ago. I was hoping that it would be an easy 3” ID into a 3” OD and I was wrong. The Walker 15034 converter I was installing had a 3” ID on both ends which was fine for the exhaust pipe from the manifold but that left me with my Dynomax 42606 connector pipe slipping into the converter rather than the other way around… the connector pipe was needed to make up the difference with the shorter length of the converter to what was there previously. I tried SmartParts 300300 3&#34; lap joint on the Walker exhaust side but the pipe was thick and it wouldn’t work get a tight fit so I cut a 5-inch length of pipe to slip in as a nipple; added some Permatex 80335 Sealer; butted the pipes together; and then installed the clamp again and all is good. I had to cut four slits into the converter and use a compression clamp on the engine side. I used the SmartParts 320300 3&#34; lap joint but on the extension pipe to the muffler and that was easy. My first time using this type of clamp and it was a mistake not trying them earlier. I couldn’t get the old converter off the Walker 44461 Extension Pipe so I ended up have to cut it and it was buggered that I ended up replacing it because I couldn’t get a new pipe far enough into it to prevent it from leaking… the old clamp had made an indentation on the top that prevented the pipe from going all the way. Good news is if I ever need to pull it apart connectors that don’t distort the pipes will make it easy. Since this was all one pain in the butt project the review is for everything I used. Everything was a quality product I have to go with 5-stars for them all. However, not all clamps fit 3” ID pipe like that on my converter, especially those from SmartParts, but the Dynomax 35794 3” clamps were a perfect fit. I cut slits in the pipe to get a better compression but a little torque would have worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.ve worked but might have made the pipe bend and be difficult to impossible to get off if ever needed. Welding just wasn’t an option for me.
B001NZ0SP8|4|It did the trick
B002ZBWKAU|1|This product does not display your actually tire pressure accurately.  You must use a hand held tire pressure gauge to confirm the inflated pressure.  The value is always low on my pump.
B00QH2MKGC|5|Excellent would buy again!
B00LXAFQE6|5|Looks almost loke the original one, came with battery and works like its supposed to work. Great buy
B00SGZ1LXQ|5|Looks great and works awesome very satisfied.
B0002Q8036|5|Easy installation

B001EOWPRC|5|Exactly what I wanted when I wanted it.
B00LIAL8D4|4|Was very helpful when driving our RV however the picture blinks on and out frequently.
B00WF8MZ12|5|Awesome
B005NLQAHS|5|These bluetooth OBD readers are an exceptional deal. You get a $20 reader and a $5 Android application and you have not only the ability to read MIL codes, but also real-time data on all of the sensors in your vehicle. Doesn't do ABS/CAN, but for the price, ease of use, and real-time information capabilities, I will just buy a normal reader when I need those. It will be good to keep one of these around.
B001715TYS|5|Performed the way it should.
B00684TAYY|5|Excellent
B00VNJ15LK|4|Accurate description.  Good price. Fast shipping. Good value.
B00TKNLUVQ|3|It didn't come with any hardware to but grille on so I used what I had and mad or work
B005WR2KVS|1|I should have known these would NOT be a genuine Audi OEM item, but they aren't even carbon fiber. They're solid black. Don't bother with these and just get the authentic Audi caps.
B00T5MT6KO|3|Was not easy to apply and was smaller than expected. Overall not too bad
B00XL73YTI|5|Item was as described , i think they are he eat for the price and would buy again
B006FXIAKI|5|Awesome product!!
B005NBRVKS|5|Looks awesome in a blue pick up
B00WFHWWRU|5|I love it, it was easy to install, and when it kicked in you felt it. In fact, I like this product so much I told alot of people about it, and talked my father, uncle, and a couple of friends into getting one. And they all seem to love it as well. I'll admit I had low expectations at first, but this product proved me wrong.......
B000GZAUX6|5|No issues. packaging questionable.
B00HZQ6SY4|1|Beware ....what a friggin joke
B009JG0Z74|5|Very good!
B006EGAIII|5|Work as advertised and the quality seems pretty good.
B00280759E|4|Increased the stopping power tremendously on my 08 Wrangler.<br />They are wearing quicker than the OEM pads which I half expected to happen.
B007V1UCO0|3|Good
B004K8V6XS|5|Title says it all. Part works great!
B00FRHOMNM|2|These wipers are horrible. Very streaky and do not do a very good just of just wiping away water. I finally broke down and replaced that's after 8 months, I could not stand them anymore.
B001DRLQN4|4|Bought it for my 2009 is250 but it didn't have an arrow so I wasn't sure what side the airflow was. However i'm pretty sure I installed it on the correct side. Since everything seems to work well.
B00JPIXY3S|2|Tools were a little long for the job.  They did arrive ahead of time.
B00408YLWQ|5|Excellent product. Cuts down on frequent washings.  A quick hosing off is all it takes to keep that sparkling shine.
B00QMSUPMW|5|I have two of these, one in each of my vans, and I plug a huge list of equipment into they for charging including my iPad, iPhone, headsets, test equipment and my MiFi, and never have an issue.
B00KXSN63C|1|At first it appeared that everything was fine. The color matched, the package arrived in a timely fashion, but the quality and clarity of this product made it a total waste of time, money, and energy. The directions that came with it were slightly confusing, but I read them over and over again so I know that I did what I was supposed to. The consistency of the primer did not go on smooth. The color paint would leak out of the felt pen at the top in huge spurts. The clear coat was chunky and ruined the paint. The whole thing was a fiasco and the result was even worse than the original damage.
B00FSXK734|5|great
B00EO9Z4Q8|5|Great part and much less than the dealership wanted to fix the seat!
B003WOWBPS|5|Well pleased
B00757I28S|5|Made my car look new again!
B00GHS3WJ0|5|What a great experience... The passenger side rear view mirror on our 2008 Volvo XC70 just flew off the other day while we were driving. A bit of research online taught us that this is fairly common because the heated defrost feature can cause the adhesive holding the mirror to fail. After some more online research, I found this Dorman replacement mirror at multiple sites, but I was concerned it might not really be as good as the Volvo O.E. mirror.  When I called the dealer and heard that it would be over $200 for them to replace the mirror with parts from Volvo, I decided to give the DIY Dorman part a shot instead. The price was right on amazon, and I got the mirror the very next day after I ordered. I just installed it, and it went perfectly. It looks every bit as good as the mirror it replaced, and the whole process took about five minutes. If you need one, this works.
B001U8QP8W|5|Love the seat cover ...... 100%
B00EWSE5HA|5|It was delivered  on time. Fit perfectly !  And very easy to install
B0035R5P3M|5|Bought to replace my originals with 250k out of my 99 runner. I combined these with the 1&#34;/1.5&#34; daystar spacer lift with great results. I sit about 1.5&#34; taller overall and no more rear end sag. The install wasn't bad, I did it alone over a Saturday.
B004I0RQRS|5|Worked great had bulbs and pigtail,excellent fit.
B001N2O3PM|4|Attractive piece that compliments my Jeep very well. I also have one on my pickup truck, and another on the 4Runner.  Our plates would get bent at the car wash, and this alleviates the issue.  Would be 4 stars if it had a slot for the plate to slide into, this one just sits on top of the plate.
B00HVO0LVG|5|Bought as holiday gifts and everyone was happy. A practical and good to have emergency tool. Something that folks don't tend to buy for themselves.
B000B8LKS2|5|Identical replacement as the original on my 1990 Cadillac Deville. Bought from Amazon, and text on cap as on photo
B000C9DV0A|5|Good Product Thanks!
B004A6MA8U|5|had to buy new bolts to attach the fan housing to the radiator but i was needing to go to the store anyways lol besides that it fit and haven't had any leaks
B000C9FAF4|1|This did not include the switch that is shown in the picture. I question if it is a GM part, as the number is different on the part and the listing. Contacted owner and it took several attempts to get an answer about the switch.
B00B4YV0GY|5|It's the perfect size it works real good. And is good quality
B000BOZVW2|5|No blurry or hazy images.  Installed it easily into a Jeep JK. In spite of the sometimes bumpy ride in the Jeep while off-roaming, it performs great. I would definitely recommend.
B00806GLBS|5|Good stuff
B000N4UQL6|5|Excellent
B0019S8BDU|5|perfect fit for the  ford
B001C4SL4U|5|Greatly reduced turbo lag in my 2010 Cooper S.
B00UK5AKEQ|1|Will change my review once the problem is fixed.<br />We ordered this light strip and just got the time to install it and found we received 2 six foot Strips and NOT 1 16Ft strip like we order. If you look at the picture, the spool of light has 4 sets of wires, we would have to hook it up from 2 different ends for the 12v. The OEM that you mount the light in is 16ft
B00K1C1WC2|5|Cool chokers, only one set needed.
B00EOAL22C|3|I had hoped the decal of the bear would sit parallel to the base of Cali, but it doesn't. It's skewed a bit. Also, I don't know if I would buy it again for the almost $7 I paid for it.<br /><br />However, the colors pop, the cut are clean, and it's about the size of the length of my palm. I'm about 5'10''.
B006CRETZ2|5|Easy to install and fit perfect! It runs great now!
B004BCJEBO|5|looks and works great!
B001GMXA2Q|3|Had a bit of difficulty following the instructions. Ended up having the local repair shop install it. But it works fine now.
B000EVYGZA|5|very good
B008CF9A60|5|This good works on my 2008 Mazda 3
B001CQWM8E|3|This is seems to be a nice mirror but it will not fit a can-am commander. That is why it only got 3 stars.
B00JBICHB2|5|great product..great price..now if they work when they are put in
B000C9DHGI|5|Perfect replacement.  You'll need 2 more if your 4X4 vacuum switch on the transfer case is leaking fluid into the vacuum system.  Check for oil in the rubber lines.
B00514A2T4|5|Looks good and simple to install. Save money with Kuryakyn.
B0002M9QJM|5|Yes very happy thank you 👌
B00EUVFIGG|1|When you send power to it it stays on and never shuts off and the turn signals do not work properly
B0012UJXX2|5|I love it, fast shipping
B006EH9WUC|5|It works well enough, but somewhat inconvenient to have to raise hood to get at it.
B00G2TV7OG|1|Will not work as an OEM 3157 brake light in a 2005 GMC Yukon
B000JZB4DI|5|just like original fits good. very pleased with it.
B0081S8PD2|5|Good part.  Thanks.

B00U6NNPEY|5|Great
B005CHFD62|5|Not much you can say about a decal but made well and they shipped it fast!
B002TIIHVK|5|They are not kidding that this cover is XL. I have a 2006 Acura MDX which came with a donut spare. I decided to buy a rim and keep one of my old tires as a full-size spare, but I did not want it exposed to the elements. I was reading up on various chat forums about this dilemma, and many users recommended a spare tire cover, but many of these users stressed that you should buy a XL size since L will be a very tight fit.<br /><br />My tire's size is 235/65-17 and this cover is way too big for it. I had some paracord and I was poking some holes to tighten the cover onto my tire. So, it's good enough! I did not want to take a star off my review because it's not their fault for an XL cover being XL! It is great quality!
B00D061NFM|5|Great hat.  Like the plaid underneath the brim.  Has a small VW tag on the back.  Price was very good.  My only issue would be that the white color might get dirty easily.  But it looks so good I would buy again in a heartbeat.
B00062ZDY0|5|I have been using K&N filters for years. This is a top quality aftermarket filter!
B001TI5IIQ|1|Could have used toothpaste instead. followed direction and did not work as well as I thought.
B00OZ10Y6K|5|Can you give me values of max sound intensity.
B00BTGDR9A|5|Very high quality pads. Will purchase again
B00GAFIKV0|5|great quality curtains all around! Came with one plastic stem thing to hold the curtains forgot what its called and also came with a metal one which is flexible in order to form the shape of the car windows. in order to have the 3m tape to stick you need to prep the area!!!! Clean the areas with alcohol and try heating up the 3m tape with a hair dryer to get a better adhesion. Buying another pair for the rears very soon!
B0034RKNPS|5|Oem !!!!
B002SINBRQ|5|I bought a pair one  for each of my daughters, after a cheap pair flamed and melted while jumping a truck.  Make sure you get a heavy duty set (6 or 8 gauge) if you will be jumping anything larger than a golf cart
B00J1C4D2Y|5|Fits perfect ,the right colorand they look nice and fell plush
B008CH9KVI|2|Plastic....You get what you pay for
B0024E66NK|4|Im very pleased with this cover so far.  Very nice quality, looks great on the trailer.
B013W43PHA|5|Works great highly visible as a deterrent for theft.  By johlibb
B0015PK3AG|5|Have been using this for over a year now, it takes off some really tight filters and best of all made in the US of A
B000E0G7FI|5|incredible sound and performance fast shipping and well protected :D
B000IYPSF0|5|This product is working very well and was very easy to install.
B00FYX204C|2|It's a little cheaper and thinner than I expected. It's also not very grippy at all. It slides all over the place. Now Ill have to adhere it to the hard plastic floor somehow.
B00718VZ8A|5|Excellent product. Works best on level sites. Does reduce 'trailer movement (sway) ' when used on level surfaces.
B003TQ6IOY|5|Perfect
B000CIT3N0|5|Great quality. Never have any problems removing or installing, never any drainback problems with a horizontal installation [can't say the same for Fram filters ...]<br /><br />Happy to use them on extended drain intervals of 7,500 miles and greater.<br /><br />Watch for the infrequent sale prices. Sometimes in the $8 range, or two for $17, including Prime shipping.
B00D0XHGTC|5|Product was as it was described and installed easily. No issues and arrived as promised.
B00U05XVOC|5|Fits everything 100% snug. Can't beat the warranty either.
B006B269QK|5|Every was in there and seemed to be of good quality.
B001OZW8PK|1|Says it fits Ford Focus 2001, but it does not fit mine. I have a Ford Focus LX 2001.
B00KTJ9I46|5|Product arrived as promised on time. Came with easy to use instructions. I was able to get them programed within minutes. They work very well and seem to of good quality at a good price.  I would recommend.
B00FYX2WEU|5|This fits pretty good in my 96 toyota camry, my seats look pretty good.
B000BQYH6Q|3|I thought they were rubber because they look like rubber
B0041CDV72|5|Followed the trouble shooting guidelines in the factory electrical manual for my road king. Had to be regulator. Seen way too many recommendations for Cycle Electric parts in all the forums to consider anything else.
B00NHBYOA6|5|Awesome. Totally brilliant.  Plenty of room gets real cold runs on 12V or 120V it's good price as well,
B00VJURTD6|5|Great clearance lights for my enclosed trailer.
B00DVSKJOA|5|Just what I expected.
B00EDFM5QU|5|Best price for a 921 type LED buld and they are very bright.  Personally I can't see the difference between this and a normal bulb.  They are definitly not as hot.  I would purchase again.
B00IPS4APU|5|License plates here in Idaho have a mountain scene and a potato but a cracked windshield would be much more representative. I only drive on paved roads and in the last few trips I picked up 3 bull’s-eye chips and a few minor chips and this kit did them all. The last kit I used was the Stoner 95141 and that was just enough for one large chip. Last year I went to a glass shop and had one repaired and it was no better than the results I got from  the Rain-X. I’ve probably done about two dozen chips in the last 8-years and I have yet to get a repair anywhere near what many reviewers claim to have achieved and that is a repair that is so good that you can’t detect it without knowing where I was beforehand. I know I’m doing it correctly but if you want to believe your repair will be virtually invisible you may be open to disappointment. I’m happy that this stuff stops the chip from becoming a running crack and my windshield doesn’t look like every fifth vehicle I see on the road. This kit is about as goof-proof as they come and even after the first application you can still add a few drops more, put the plastic on it and let it cure… and keep doing so until the repair is complete. Since I never expected an invisible repair I went with 5-stars primarily because I had not complaints with it but also because I did five repairs on the same windshield with it and I just purchased another kit for the next round of repairs on my truck because you really need to get something into these holes before a crack starts and you need to replace the whole windshield.
B00GOP6XDS|5|I have no idea what the other reviewer is talking about!  I have a 1995 GMC Safari and it fit perfectly!  The hole he had to braze over if for a vent line from the gas tank.  My old gas cap fit just fine.
B001UL4ALS|5|Great clamp tool
B00HJDY6PG|5|Just what was needed for new car.
B00GI781O6|1|Didn't fit

B00KTHY91K|5|Works great with my 2003 Camry LE.  Was able to look up the programming instructions and quickly get it working.
B000JZMZIG|5|Great price. This does not come with a conventional boot. Seems odd, but there is an internal seal that does the some thing... how well, we'll see.
B00O07LBOI|5|Fit perfectly in the floor of my CJ7, I bedlined the floor and the factory ones got destroyed when removing, these are easy to remove and install.
B00CHDMQQO|5|Fit on my Prius and did not take very long to install.
B000UUMM6K|5|just as described.. reccomend..
B000UKJG7I|5|Parts fits perfect. Money well spent. Im really happy how well my Yamaha Zuma performs.
B00075UD64|5|It was a perfect fit.
B00FSOVBZQ|5|Great bag
B009AKCUCC|4|The mats fit perfectly; however, they definitely are not that same quality as OEMs. Mainly they are not as thick, but the price point reflects that. No complaints overall, you get what you pay for.
B004NBCB4K|2|Mounts not the exact same as OEM, left hand lower mount poorly welded to condenser, found laying in the bottom of the box. If I wasn't in a bind I'd sent it back.
B008NDGSHA|1|sun faded in less than a week
B005XQJJJ4|5|Great mirror and easy to install after looking up a video on YouTube.
B009DJSJNY|1|I have ordered 2 of these and both broke.  Very frustrated and spent hundreds in putting them in.
B001P11SCM|4|It's great it worked as expected. Would have given it 5 stars but the wires coming out of the unit had to be spliced to the existing wires I was expecting a plug to plug into the one on my Ford F-250.
B00MMQB0HC|5|Love the product and customer service
B006G2MJZU|5|Excellent product, works perfect.

B005DN1GT8|5|Perfect length to replace the muffler on a 2005-2007 Ford F250/350.  Welded beautifully and fit with enough adjustment to make proper install super easy.
B00BITHO74|4|It was an easy item to install.  Has worked well so far...!!
B000CPATOA|5|Used on my 2004 Silverado SS, look good and did help braking a little.
B00Y5OAGA6|3|Looked great until the first time I washed my car 10 days after application .  The red paint in the &#34;L&#34; came off. I repainted and sealed it. Quality control issue I suspect.
B006K8ZHOU|5|Perfect fit and great price
B002LF7CI0|5|I like it very easy to put on fits perfect looks good it's nice because don't have to worry about trying to get the snow out underneath it whith out breaking  it or having to clean out all the leafs you get the point ..
B000VVVJWQ|5|Ordered this item while I was stationed overseas expecting to install it soon..Unfortunately it sat in at the vehicle location for 18 months awaiting my return.<br /><br />Upon return I attempted to install the item and found it inoperative.  The solenoid connection was faulty and may have been broken in shipment, but after 18 months I had no options with claiming it via USPS or Amazon.  I emailed Powermaster Performance and had a response on the next day, Saturday.  The owner called me and worked out a way for me to get a replacement in the local area and within the same day.<br /><br />This is a top of the line starter that will out last your flywheel or flexplate gears.  It cranks my 13:1 SBF over like no other starter has in the past.  Gone are the days of installing OEM starters every 6 - 8 months due to them burning out.<br /><br />Powermaster is my car's new best friend and they just earned a customer for life.  That means a lot to me because I have owned the same 65 GT 350 replicar that I built by hand 30 years ago, I have all the parts receipts from day one, and I return to reliable suppliers.<br /><br />The 9503 is the same starter I have seen in every quality build car of the cars I envy.  Powermaster is reliable and an outstanding product built by a company that stands behind their product. I would definitely buy this again if I had to build a new motor, but seeing as this will last forever I will not have to get a replacement.
B009IHQGPY|4|Looks good on the camaro

B00P929UIW|1|Everything worked on it except the compass. The instruction sheet was so jumbled up by whomever translated it, that it is nearly impossible to understand. The translator was not as familiar with English as he/she should be. Couldn't get the compass to work.
B004BGVN3M|5|very nice
B00C3U7P1W|2|It looks cool but the quality is very crappy. I put it on my eclipse a few minutes ago and it already looks like it's coming off. We will see how it goes.
B00MAG6RMM|5|Used these to replace incandesent lights in RV. I will be changing these lights out soon also. These lights are too blue light for inside my RV. Good bulbs will be used in my truck. Works well light like a floresent bulb.
B00W8DBZQU|5|I just got the mats in today. They are heavy duty flexible rubberized material. They fit like a glove in my 2015 Jeep Renegade. A+++ to Mopar.
B00A2EMPN4|4|The seat is poor quality, and came apart first ride. Also it is sloped forward and you bounce forward. Seat needs to be redesigned.
B00XVUNW4M|5|Amazing stuff.<br /><br />I used this to replace OEM exhaust insulation that had crumbled.<br /><br />Note that you can only insulate a foot or two of exhaust with this length. I overlapped my wraps by half. The stainless ties are very nice but, note that you can get them cheaply in packs of 50 elsewhere on amazon.
B00DSPEEVA|5|Very good windshield , it makes a big difference  with the wind then the short factory one.
B00CFL8ZL8|5|I have a 2012 nissan juke with red trim leather seats and these make the car look fantastic, not including how great they feel against the body. I get compliments on them all the time when people enter my car because it makes my car look sporty. love these!!!!
B008N8IMI8|5|fantastic value for money
B004WO926S|5|Very great. Perfect fit for zr2 oem
B00760R6KY|5|my wife lovesit
B0009IBJCQ|1|Junk, 3 months then dead , used a couple times
B006G716KE|5|works great
B005MZV86I|5|Smaller than I wanted, but high quality
B005FKVYAU|5|Put these on my X @240,000.  It has never stopped this good.
B009AA2FAY|5|As these are at nearly half the price they ask at the local auto parts store, I decided to replace both left and right sensors.  I'm glad I did, as there was significant corrosion on both.  And if one failed, the other might not be far behind.  I recommend pulling the airbag fuse AND disconnecting the battery.  Anyway, they worked flawlessly.  Out went the airbag light and the &#34;service airbag&#34; message disappeared.
B007FGR852|3|no instructions. Not as sturdy as I'd like but it holds in place. Keeps a lil wind off my chest mostly feel it in the shoulders now.
B00TFMZ4XM|5|fits great on my subaru outback back windshield. A bit overpriced as I came to find out but it does what its supposed to do
B00CPR5G50|5|Looks awesome on my hubby's truck
B00KTJDWDY|5|Fast shipping ans works great.  Very quiet.  I am very happy with this OEM fan assembly.
B00L7XBHDI|4|looks beautiful on my s10
B006ZVLHLO|5|I could have spent much more, but I didn't. This part works well and I'm very satisfied.
B00P0EJV0G|3|Overall, the design is cute. The fabric material is so-so. The black parts are made of this fuzzy velvet like stuff, and the cheetah pattern is this silky material. Nothing about installing this is your car will be easy... I was so frustrated by the time I managed to get everything in place. The good: -Ordered the product on August 9th, received it August 20th, took about 10 days as listed. really adorable design -The gold stitching glows under my blue LED overhead lights! -came with little hooks to help you hook the elastic straps onto your car. -The neck rest pillows are actually very comfy. -Steering wheel cover is very sturdy, maybe a bit too sturdy though. The bad: -Poor packaging. It was wrapped in plastic and all folded up, the seat covers now have a bunch of creases and wrinkles, hopefully they'll go away in the future. -You really need removable headrests, there is a slit in the covers that allow for you to put the headrest back in. I did not realize my car didn't have removable headrests. Luckily there is only about an inch of stitching in the middle of the slits that I just cut and shoved it over my head rests. -Everything was a pain in the ass to get installed, be prepared to get really, really mad. -The steering wheel cover takes a lot of work to put in, and I mean A LOT! -The wing mirror cover that is listed is actually this weird, garter like elastic thing that's only about an inch in width. Also, it is not a wing mirror cover because your wing mirror is the one located on the outside. It looks like it's actually meant to be for your rear view mirror, and if you have a thicker plastic one that had the OnStar buttons and such, it will just slide off... -Although the material feels nice, it is definitely made cheaply and I do expect rips in the future, especially because... IT DIDN'T FIT MY FRONT SEATS. I was told it would fit, but my seats are wider, curved slightly and longer than the covers, so towards the bottom it is just stretched over my seats and was not able to tuck them inside the seat. So if it did fit my seats correctly, I would give this product 4 stars. I drive a Mercury Milan, which is the sister to the Ford Focus so I would expect these covers not to fit in a Ford Focus or any Mercury vehicle. I'm sure they would look really nice if they had fit properly. I would honestly of returned them since they fit so poorly in the front, but I had already damaged the back seats by cutting the slit fully open for the headrests...
B000CSS994|5|Worked as should
B001W0FTF8|5|Fast Shipping, Great Packing!! Awesome Item
B00DZXS1DM|5|Exactly as described. It is a brushed chrome look which matched the emblems on my car. I just put it on, so I can not tell you how well it will stand up over time. It came with the bolt covers also.
B011ICD2WQ|1|I already have a high quality code scanner but I ordered this unit specifically for the SRS code reading capability. The unit arrived promptly. The documentation is not included. The website does not allow manual download (broken presently looks like a corrupt file on their end). Customer service confirmed he did could not download the manual and said he would send me a copy to my email. It has not arrived. Technical support could not confirm how to read the SRS code either and did not seem to know how to use the unit - and this was not some answering service out of country - this was the manufacturer from what I could tell! All I know right now is that it did not read the SRS code, customer service and technical support at Actron is a joke and I have wasted my time. I will give Actron a little more time to figure this out and then this is going back to Amazon ASAP so I do not waste my money as well! In the meantime, I am searching for a better brand with a unit that will work.
B00E6M2F6K|4|Great mirrors, but puddle lamp doesn't work like they say! I have a 2011
B00XQVA6GI|1|Fell apart in a few months of light use. No refund available. Oh well.
B00ITEXEG6|5|As advertid
B00L45AU6E|5|Very practical and well made.
B002ERQJS4|5|The was very easy to install. We have a Ford Fusion and we were given a bike rack with would need this hitch. My husband was able to put the one fairly easily, and we use it almost everyday hauling our bikes.
B00I3E2BWK|5|Exlcelent buy!!!!
B010VUZDC8|3|Disappointed because several diamond blings were missing. So there are a few gaps without bling. I don't feel like it is worth the money it will cost to return to sender.
B00C28ZYHC|5|fits 2001 sport trac and you can use the factory hooks too. its a good bar for looks and to mount a light bar on!!
B008I7OFB2|5|Fit vehicle just fine.  Good product.  Thanks.
B00IVKYBJC|5|It's a sticker, it sticks. Need I say more.
B00WFHUYCU|5|Product as expected! Fast shipping!
B00P2D3VZG|5|A very good LED set from PHILIPS when comparing to OSRAM in term of price and quality.  It is very bright and almost as like as daylight.  The clear light cover from my car makes it a perfect match selection.  I already ordered some more for the second car.  A little upgrade expense for the 10-yrs old car is really worth it.  Try it for your car and you'll be happy.
B001RZ62S6|5|Picked up my sagging front end niclely. Used for a riding season and no problems. Would definitely recommend
B00I1ASD96|5|Love the look, much better than the factory lights.  I had to change the fuse, but things work now.
B00E0LI09S|1|Bright enough. Ordered 4 total lights. 2 of these floods and 2 same type spots. A junior high student could have machined them better. All 4 lights look like they're from the same factory and all four needed work to be used. Mounts don't fit, wrong bolts, mis-drilled, untapped holes partially filled with powder coat, etc. You get the idea. I wouldn't recommend these to a friend if I wanted to keep that friend as a friend... Don't buy unless you have more time than money.
B00JH6K4HW|2|Doesn't work.....
B00UZYGWBM|5|Fit perfect.  Quality seems good.  Price is great.  Works great.  Five Stars.
B000AP6RG6|5|Awesome I love it _ just added some heat sheild around intake hose for cooler running
B0002LBKF6|5|Best car wax ever used. Follow the directions
B000WJA5ZY|4|Great arm to clear a tall motorcycle windshield
B00UVYS1B0|5|Both my old remotes gave up. Dealer wanted $250 for parts and programming. Bought this unit, moved a key head over from my old key and programmed in a flash.  Work like a charm.<br /><br />The key head with this unit does come with a chip, so i plan to have it cut as a spare.
B0054YCW62|5|Used 2 of these to cover 16 river tubes.  they worked great.
B00CBZDENC|5|Item as advertised
B002NEUOGG|5|I use these to deflate my tires when driving on the beach to go fishing and they work very well.  I used to use a tire gage to deflate my tires but that took a long time.  I can have all four deflated to the proper psi in 5 minutes with these.
B00QYBFBSK|5|It didn't reason much, but I think it did the trick.  I am very pleased
B000C94YSI|1|I ordered 2 of these. One came with a broken pickup! USELESS...
B00YVHGTBM|5|Works awesome! Bought it for my 08 Audi A4, and it worked right away flawlessly.
B004L5WLZ2|5|I have a black vehicle and this stuff makes it look great.  It is easy to put on and easy to get off.  It seems to leave a deeper shine while leaving fewer smears and no residue.
B000B6AF2G|1|This is a terrible product. I sprayed it on my black rims and this came out bluish white. Very dissatisfied. Wating to see if I can paint over it....
B00CIVI51K|5|Amazon said it didn't fit my 2009 Suzuki Equator, but it did! Installed and it is working great. Price was a fourth of local parts store.
B00B5YVYTQ|3|The product its good, but the instalation its very difficult.
B007ZLKVNS|5|Perfect fit on my 2004 Ford F-150!
B0049IFX56|4|I purchased a few of these. Not sure how to replace the battery once this one dies. I dislike the fact that I can not turn off the l.c.d. display to conserve power for when I actually run my generator, but that is the only CON I can come up with, other than I had to do a master reset on one to get it going again. In turn I lost my data which was unfortunate.
B00AF5YM90|1|it did not work
B0021UMTZQ|4|It works if you do it right.
B000PKX7FU|5|Installed in a 1979 Volvo 244 with the B21A engine based on my mechanic's recommendation.  This car had not been run in a while so I did a full tune up:distributor cap, new rotor, spark plug wires, plugs and new fuel injectors.<br /><br />She runs like a champ now, like a much younger car.
B002BHWZFI|2|Malo
B00LOS93FA|2|I got a 20% refund and had to fix the part myself.  I'm not impresses with the quality. They did at least offer me the 20% back.
B011GTIMS0|5|Lights are bright and are easy to hook up! Comes with one lead wire out from the main box and leads into a cluster of 12 female ends and all you have to do is run your wires from each light back to that cluster and plug the male end in but took a total of 3 hours but that was really tucking wires and talking to my buddies! Grave Yard Horse Garage Approved!!!
B00D8NAD1M|5|works perfectly
B001OBDI3K|4|Got these to do a brake job on my Sebring JXi convertible. Remaned calipers means I don't have to worry about the piston seizing in the caliper bore and taking out my new pad and slotted rotor kit.
B00KTP4138|5|Fit perfectly
B006VQZWE6|5|Put these on my 2010 street glide look fantastic nice and tight don't move at all. the blue tint cuts down on headlight glare. Best price purchase for mirrors I ever had.
B001C90W2Y|3|Increased the stopping power tremendously on my 08 Wrangler. Unfortunately one of the backing shims migrated down to the brake rotor and the noise scared me to death while driving on the freeway. Sounded like a bearing in the drive train going out.<br />They are wearing quicker than the OEM pads which I half expected to happen.
B006G6VDQC|5|Works great
B00XORKOWU|5|This product is nice and looks good my only problem is that they rattle against the pillar I fixed it myself by putting weather stripping behind it other than that I'm a very happy buyer
B002EC9MFG|5|it works great
B000OCH4YO|5|Good quality bristles. Nice long extension handle. Does well on the RV and I am sure on anything else I need that kind of reach.
B001O7BKR0|5|Worked great, no issues. FIt like OEM. So far it has about 4 hours on my boat. No issues noted. If this changes, I'll update. Otherwise I would say this is a good update to your OEM module.<br /><br />I used it on a 1994 Mercruiser 3.0L 4 cylinder I/O motor.
B000E8T7VQ|5|Easy install, proper unit for 2005 mustang V6. While installing it, I also cleaned out the drain nearby which clogs and floods the carpet under the glovebox.
B006UZWYD0|5|Nice socket set.  Sae and mm
B00CO2QQQ4|4|Decent product for the money
B005XIAW02|1|didnt work on my e34 1993
B00W8ADB1K|5|This organizer stays in place, rather than flopping all around like the longer ones. Plus, it's shorter size allows me to still use the mesh pocket that is built into the back of the seat. It holds quite a bit, and it's easy to see what I've put into the organizer (with deeper pockets things sometimes get lost in the bottom). So far, I really like it.
B00ATWGSLE|5|Have them on my Mustang. Just love them.
B00411JRBM|5|Large field of view.  Minimum vibration. Good product and Quick delivery.
B00H005QXE|1|Did not fit my car at all even tho make model and year were given.  Would not supply return postage up to buyer to send back only give 40% credit cost more to ship back than to just keep it..  Another item for the garage sale..
B004KGAP3C|5|Love your price
B00JSYOE1A|5|Yep, it is a genuine OEM part.  Identical to the original one I replaced on my '06 Pol Sportsman.  Works perfectly.
B002Q39MZI|4|BE CAREFUL when ordering this fitting!  The picture shown is not the fitting you are getting as the picture shows a FEMALE 8AN to a 1/2in tube-end (which is what I needed).  The description, however is the correct item you will be getting (MALE 8AN to 1/2in tube).  I breezed through my ordering of fittings and failed to read that detail fully...turns out it worked better for me anyway.
B0074FQKDA|5|The unit works great I would buy again from you.
B006ZR4DSC|5|Tells these Panthers who's boss!  Love it!
B00CDO9I0O|4|I recommend this product to others. I liked it!!!! Fits perfectly well on my car..
B00JH2GMMC|5|Perfect replacement for my 2010 GMC Sierra.  Relatively easy to install.  Watch the video that someone else mentioned first though.
B000E4IGL2|5|After reading other reviews about these fog lights, thought I'd try them.  These are the exact same lights as the Chevy dealer was trying to sell me at more than triple the price.  Being a woman, I'm tired of being ripped off by garages, so I opted to purchase these from US Auto and I couldn't be happier.  They were so helpful answering questions and the fog lights were installed in less than 10 mins. If you question the quality, Don't. - these look just like the factory fog lights.  I only needed 1 but purchased both since Tahoe's fog lights seem to go out or break faster.  So happy with my purchase - you will not be disappointed.  US Auto is bookmarked for future auto parts purchases.
B007NIYA4Y|3|I bought these for my 2005 dodge ram 1500. Took a while to receive them and when i got them I noticed why they weren't very expensive super thin cheap material almost broke both of them putting it in. There not black but more of a off black color. They don't fit snug to the fog light but they will do for now. U get what u pay for. I would recomend going with OEM. Check a junk yard before buying these.
B003FBV8ZW|5|This is a really great deal! At Harley you get 1 pair at this price! Very happy to have 3! Work great! Look very stylish as well as functional! Very happy with our purchase.
B00651CLCS|3|Looks great BUT radio reception clarity has decreased. I expected more out of it based on other reviews.
B000JYFL6K|5|These are great Water Pumps. The pump is not Black. The Black ones are a Cast Iron pump which is very heavy, rusts and is a standard pump.<br />The GMB 130-1260P is an aluminum light weight, high performance pump that can help cure overheating. This is the same type pump that Olds Specialty Stores sell for well over one hundred. They just grind off the GMB on the casting.<br />These are extremely hard to find. The big four Auto Parts houses in my area &#34;Never Heard Tell Of Such&#34;... when I asked for this pump by part number!<br />I buy extras for back, as who knows when they might stop making this pump for a motor that they quit making almost 40 years ago.<br />A Big Block Olds 425 - 455 with an Aluminum intake, Heads and this GMB Pump weights allot less than a stock small block Chevy, which can  easily make 400 HP and 500 lb. ft. of torque and get close to 20 MPG with a 200-4R overdrive transmission.
B00DB8QS6I|4|Looks great on truck, installation directions could have better photos, and installation a bit tricky.
B0047D2FWM|4|Does the job, handles make it easier to carry this heavy jack around, mine did not come in the advertised colors it came in all silver, kind of annoying
B002N5PQOA|2|I needed something fast to mend my converter pipe which completely rusted apart so I bought this at a local auto parts store. As others have stated the bolt is way to short, the metal is cheap and flimsy, and it is a real pain to get the clip to stay in the slot when tightening...that said I did use a longer bolt and it has held for a month now...!!.....a better and cheaper fix is to get a Plumbing heavy duty 2 &#34; No-Hub connector and just use the clamp minus the rubber sleeve....hope this helps
B00WZX9Z7E|3|Nice looking , but one of the lugnuts came off in about two weeks:(
B00JABR3FU|2|Issue on the 60 portion of the seat cover , when the center arm rest is pulled down it expose the seat and its not protected. Also a small section of the seat cover that covers just underneath the arm rest kept pulling off, it just has one small velcro that attaches to the 40 portion of the seat.<br />which also brings another problem the 60/40 seat covers should not be attach at any point which hinders the operations of lowering the backs separately .
B001PWFPE8|5|Very good product it fit perfect on my 2011 GMC sierra
B001O7DNZC|1|These fuel injectors are nearly a half inch longer than the factory injectors. I have a 2007 Pontiac Grand Prix with the SFI 3.8L V6 and these were supposed to fit my vehicle. When I installed them they were so much longer that the lower O-ring sat so deep inside of the intake manifold that it wouldn't create a seal rendering these useless for the stated vehicle. In the photo the Standard Motor Products FJ723 Fuel Injector is shown (the gray one on the left) next to the OE factory injector from the vehicle (the black one). You can see how much longer the Standard Motor Products inject is vs the factory injector.
B000LU9QZY|5|This item really works as advertised. I installed today on my Corvette with a Sony radio.<br />I have to say the interface didn't need any adjustment, but I do really appreciate the comments and instructions from the guys who instated this item way before me.<br />Everything was straightforward, and the sound system on my Vette now is amazing. It was kind of hard to hide the interface and make the stereo fit, I mean all together in that space, but wrong with it.<br />Customer service at Pac. com excellent!!!!
B011VNB75Q|5|The Handybar is great! Easy to use; small enough to put in center console. Really gives good support when getting out of car.
B004QO401Q|5|These are bright, easy to install and look good...a lot brighter and nicer than the old originals.
B00VXFKGE6|1|Terrible purchase. It uses plastic threads to screw onto the hose and the threads are clearly off, it won't screw properly onto the hose. Worthless junk
B00FPT37RO|5|Great mount
B003676LXE|5|Exactly what I ordered. Great stocking stuffers for my father and husband.
B00N9GV4YS|5|Great steering wheel cover it matches with my seat covers! I love it
B0002NUNM0|5|I use this on my 2015 wrx every other time,  great finish on the leather.
B000M5X0IM|5|Works great
B008QXZ5UI|5|work great. recommend as a preventative measure
B00D3QUMWO|5|perfect fit. easy to replace.
B008G3KCHE|5|Perfect factory replacement for my '95 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie edition.
B00AZMBB5Q|4|product looks good. Did not installed it yet. will post later.
B0002MABGE|2|Not as advertised.  Does not fit well with all cars.
B000WJX4BQ|4|Perfect match for my factory Honda Rancher ATV. Easily installed and strarts every time.  This battery is much better than the big box store batteries.
B007QBJ9J4|5|Fixed my broken door handle on my 2006 mitsubishi eclipse . Easy installation took me only a few minutes to remove and install the new one.<br /><br />To strengthen the new one I filled it with an epoxy to prevent it from snapping at the same spot it had 3 times before . After I filled the center with epoxy the new one last over 2 years and never broke and felt stronger and more secure than the previous ones .
B00NPIUFMM|2|Put these in the backup lights of a 2004 Dodge Caravan.  Now granted, those lenses might not be super clear, but I haven't been overwhelmed by their brightness as other viewers suggest they might be.  They are brighter than normal bulbs, but it isn't like you're backing up with a headlamp!<br /><br />That would be okay, since I expect these to be pretty rugged, but one of them failed after about 2 days.  Haven't looked into a replacement yet, so can't comment on that process.
B002NAQNPG|5|We are so pleased with these headlights! Very bright and paid a fantastic price for them! Also were delivered within 2 days! Came quicker than expected. Amazon, you are the best!
B00DP4NLMC|1|it didn't fit
B009D3194G|5|Used to replace the front pegs with mini boards on a CTX1300. The fit/finish is great and they function as they should. I can still stand up on the new boards to get temp relief on long rides. I'm a bit over 200lbs and they do not bend at all.
B000ACR0GU|5|Great gift
B00736CO2Q|5|Perfect fit, half the price!
B000GZJW1C|5|Looks good on my Goldwing
B00FX479WK|5|The product itself works as described. Five stars for the product. Zero stars for the shipping. I ordered two bottles and both were a horrible leaking and stinky mess.  I originally thought that the reason for the damaged order was that the cap on the bottle of TRIX was mot properly tightened. Upon closer inspection it is clear the cap on the new (damaged) bottle is defective. When I tighten one my old bottles, they close securely. When I try to tighten the new (damaged) one, the plastic cap makes a popping sound and loosens again. The new plastic, child<br />Proof-caps are defective. Because of this lack of quality control Amazon has lost $70. of merchandise and while opening the package, I was covered with the leaking and stinky contents of the package. I think a talk with the supplier of in order.
B000182ESM|5|Fits perfect on my 2002 chevy Silverado
B006GWVBQ8|4|Very good product!
B0040CZ1DA|5|Everything was as promised.
B0038RDQA8|5|Serves its purpose, looks nice
B00QK412NY|5|Perfect fit for my vehicle. Works very well in rainey weather.
B000C5I2YO|5|Great product great price..
B003VZ52EK|5|very high quality tooling and, if used properly, should be a permanent fix.  This is miles better than helicoil.
B0006IX7V0|5|They work very well to prevent flapping. I bought two pair and use both at the same time keeping all de-flappers spaced equally. The only issue is getting them off in a pouring rain to roll up your awning but doing any of that is a pain in an unexpected downpour. They are velcro so come off easy enough. Just time consuming in bad weather.
B00Y5FJK9I|1|Garbage. They fell off after a week
B005LXHZ1I|5|Good quality product, looks great on the car and the price was right. Received it in 4 days with no problems.
B001KR6PW4|5|Working Great!
B00XAX4B9A|5|Pleased with product
B00KWJVL02|5|Worth buying for keyless entry,my wife was able to program it from here scion Xb by reading instructions at  scionlife.com
B001PTBVL2|5|great product
B000CPCRBS|5|GOOD ENOUGH. NO WAY TO TELL IF THIS IS BETTER OR WORSE THAN OTHER BRANDS, BUT IT WORKS JUST FINE. I ASSUME DOT4 IS BETTER THAN DOT 3 AND WORTH THE COST.
B000B8JUAW|3|The cap was fine for about two weeks then it didn't seal perfectly and cause air getting into the system causing our check engine light to come on. We were told that only the maker of our vehicle would have gas caps that fit correctly
B00WT2FAQG|5|Very nice hitch, a little pricey but well worth the money. I like the scale on it that tells you the tongue weight. I did allot of research on<br />different hitches and this one in my opinion is the best one out there.
B00BFDG4QU|5|This was for my 2001 CRV.  I started getting the &#34;check engine&#34; light and was told that if the cap's rubber seals don't seal, you'll get the light. I was skeptical to say the least but I bought this and tried it and what do you know, it fixed it.
B001PWA0IO|5|Installed on my 2010 F-150 Platinum. Followed the provided instructions exactly and had no problem with the installation. Works as advertised, smooth operation. Great upgrade for the price.  Just installed yesterday so I cannot verify the durability but happy with the easy install process and value thus far.
B003YO5X60|5|If you want to make an easy upgrade from your base model mustang this is it. 5 minute install
B002JH469I|5|The packaging for mine was different than the picture, so it seems there are some made by different manufacturers.<br /><br />However, I ordered 2 for my 08 Mustang GT (see: Alternators/Binaltech Grimlock), and popped the GT emblems off the fenders to put these on. I was a little worried at first because they are bigger than you would expect, as many reviews have pointed out, but the final result looks downright awesome, yet subtle.<br /><br />I don't know how well mine will stand up to the Florida heat, but I'll post pics and an update in a month after they've seen some wear.
B000E4OK3K|5|GREAT
B001KS0WHC|5|Worked perfectly!
B00BSHTJFQ|5|great
B00QLKLD0Y|2|It arrived in a timely manner however it was tiny. It looks like it is much large in the picture. It is shown on the back of a truck cap. It is actually 2.5 x 6 inches.
B001C6NJOA|5|Such a clever useful design for automotive or any wiring system
B001V8U12M|5|Came in two days is as described.
B00PQWN5DQ|1|the product was delivered quickly but it will not work.  The pressure needle was positioned behind the peg which marked 0 pressure.  The needle can not move to measure pressure do to a manufacturing flaw position which means it cannot measure pressure.  The positive you can let pressure out but you cannot tell how much you have released.  I plan on returning product.  At this time I would not recommend this product.
B008S9CHZG|3|A bit noisy and the front vent on top front broke the first time I moved it.  The other vents are also loose and don't stay in position.  Fits great though.
B00CLSWCVE|5|Worked great. After first installing it it made a litle noise and I was a bit concerned it was bad. Then over about 2-3 minutes it became quiet and has worked perfect
B009FREAGO|5|Meets my requirements.
B004MNKS4Y|4|The color matches my Lincoln MKS. The applicator (pen-like) is a little funky. I found that I would put some paint into a chip, then smooth with a finger.
B00PHLF624|2|DID NOT WORK ON MY 1984 FORD ECONOLINE... DIMMER THAN STOCK LIGHTS
B00AZ4TYEE|5|I love it keep the car cool
B000C4087Y|5|Good quality and I will buy it again.
B00HRHDIP8|1|Waste of money. Chevy sticker fell off the first day I had it.
B00COMENSM|5|Received yesterday and installed today into my 2006 Toyota 4Runner SUV. Exactly the same as the originals, and worked perfectly.
B00EQGV1NE|5|​►Support the Troops: If you can't stand behind them,... -feel free to stand in front of them :-P
B00605XMZ4|5|Best wax I've ever used. I have applied it to both cars and boats, hands down the best. FYI, it is o.k. to use on black cars, but I would used a random orbital to apply/ take off. Apply an impossibly thin layer! You don't need any more than that. This stuff is very difficult to remove by hand!
B00BRAVCEK|5|I just got the 7&#34; Antenna for my 2014 Scion Tc Ltd edition and it works GREAT!!!! POP IT OFF AND SCREW THE stubby on. No static or anything AM or FM radio works great  it like the basic antenna<br />it looks 100% better than the other one.
B00WW28T16|4|I got these for my car, they work sweet!! BUT, they set off my check light, light on the dash.
B00ABKN6WI|5|Great product, exceeded my expectations
B005SEKFBC|5|Best gear oil for ARB airlockers in AAM 9.25 and 11.5 axles with 4.57 gearing. Temps are lowest ever towing or rock crawling it doesn't matter.
B000CACMMM|5|secures well and keeps luggage super dry. Used it on a 2,000 mile road trip. Worked like a charm
B00PQWN5DQ|1|Reads 40 psi when actual pressure is 35-36 psi. Tested against 3 other gauges.  Wasted my money. U get what u pay for. Will order a gauge elsewhere.
B008G37MFY|5|THEY ARE PERFECT FIT
B00BQE5HUW|5|Nice lights, but the adhesive on them needs to be stronger.
B00QPV8B22|5|These are really going to come in handy. We live in an area that when it snows, it really snows. My husband will be very grateful for these especially since he has to drive in the snow to work. We keep one vehicle in the garage, but the truck is left out in the snow. The one we have right now is really really bad.I think I got it a dollar store. These appear to be a top premium product, not something you find in a dollar store that is for sure. I love the soft  non-slip foam handles these have. They appear to be sold, strong and durable. The bristles are smooth, strong and don't come out. These make me want it to snow sooner than it's suppose to.<br />I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.
B000V528EK|5|Excellent item. Love that these have grease fittings.
B003ZZN7E8|1|The foam padding came off of the glasses found after only wearing them once
B00YBGAX2E|5|Great item!
B001FIJMI2|5|Fit was perfect to replace sticky original thermostat on my 2011 charger RT.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Worked great, easy instructions!!!
B003UW5M5I|5|I'm a Certified Shimano Tech. No mysteries here. It's the right tool.
B008A34GXQ|4|Works and is less than half the price of stock. Color code and fit are perfect.
B00AC6ZNJA|4|works great, a little squealing though so noise is an issue with these aftermarket pulleys. otherwise it lowers the rpm at highway speeds without sacrificing too much on the low end.
B0048DR4YA|5|For the price this is a good dash cover.  It is still settling into the folds and dents of the dash but fits very well.  I hope it lasts as the only thing I would classify as a negative is the weight or thickness of the cover.
B00387KTBW|4|I have a 2000 Dakota SLT 4x2 3.9L. The 2 big bushings are to large for the rear sway bar I think you need the 15mm ones. The end link bushings fit perfect. I used the stock plastic end links and just broke the plastic sleeve and then pried out the rubber bushing. These end link bushing and sleeve fit perfect into the stock links once you remove the old bushing and sleeves.
B008SR1QIW|1|wasnt wtat i expected didnt like nothing about it
B000GU32UO|5|Works great... don't have to worry about tying bike down anymore.... Shouldn't have waited so long in the first place...
B000BQW5LK|5|works fine
B00KH9PW3E|5|Was bit stiff at first.  Didn't really seem to fit.  Was thinking of replacing it.  But after using it for about a week it loosened up and fits just right now.  Not a exactly a custom fit but good enough.
B00061SGJ0|5|High quality for the low price I paid.  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B00GBVHPNW|2|These are uncomfortable for me and on my right thumb some of the material rubs it. I don't like it. Get leather baseball gloves instead
B00P9VKKVO|5|I purchased this item for a Northstar engine as a preventative measure. My engine was overheating but did not have a blown head gasket. So far so good. This item was as described and shipping was fast.
B004DRS1GQ|3|They were cheap but one came.  With a turning signal broken I had to buy the socket and it was 30 dollars since they only had it in the dealer
B00P73KWE4|5|Install was quick and easy on my 350 yamaha grizzly.  I drilled 4 holes in my factor rack to insure the basket would not move.
B007SKAKPU|5|Very handy and Reliable OBD meter to quickly figure out what's wrong with check engine light
B00REJXQ74|5|Fits like a glove...perfect
B0002T8FIS|4|Great stuff!
B0002UEPVI|5|seals great
B0080KITSM|5|Looks awesome in my Golf R. Nuff said.
B003K2GL94|1|I bought these brakes for my 2010 STi. They do not fit, despite Amazons pop up that they do.
B0075JYPNM|5|Good quality! Came faster than my old lady!
B00K33XQO6|4|this is not a direct fit option. not a bad radiator for the price but required some grinding on some of the lower mounts along with some manipulation on the ac lower mount frame to fit this.
B00IZAGV5K|1|Beware as they do NOT fit in the rear of my 2012/13 Freelander 2 when they say it should
B001IPWG7Q|5|Easy replacement when it's the right &#34;fit.&#34;
B00M069IAK|3|Did not fit on my Moto Guzzi California Custom as indicated in the description. Quality of the product is fantastic.
B00SLKXD7S|2|Only rating two stars due to the installation instructions.  Mfr. is too cheap to use 8.5&#34; x 11&#34; paper and a 10- or 12-point font.  Wouldn't kill them to use a fresh toner cartridge, either!  The text and illustrations  were so faded I had to make a dark copy on my OfficeJet and still couldn't decipher much.<br /><br />Fortunately, YouTube videos from other mfrs got the point across.  The iBoard video was a laughable promo that bragged how this product conforms to the design of the iPhone 5, hence the iBoard name!  Wow!  Even funnier, there is also a video touting an iBoard ironing board!<br /><br />They were packed well, with no defects or damages.  I mounted them safely and they look good, but I have parts left over.  Will contact ASP Autoparts Monday for help.  Meanwhile, I can't recommend buying this brand or that Amazon sell them.
B00M9MBMHC|2|Great license plate mount, Although LED lights went out 6 months after purchase.. Now I'm looking for another tag light.
B0041CA4JA|5|Just right.  1980 FXWG 260 lb rider.  It ride just above the middle middle and doesn't bottom with hard braking or bumps.
B0006MTRB0|5|Great price and product
B004AIDKAK|5|Works perfect. The other reviewer made a mistake on installation. He either didn't install a new wheel bearing, installed the new wheel bearing backwards or didn't press the hub in the new bearinh far enough. This part requires the use of a press.
B00DE2EIUE|1|Only comes with spacer, none of the mounting hardware; better off getting the Rubicon Express unit.  Off to Tractor Supply Co. to get required hardware. Ciao.
B00AKEWSBK|5|worked great in my car.
B00TA62M1K|1|THE PART WAS AFTER MARKET AND EVEN THO IS WAS ADVERTISED TO FIT, IT DID NOT.  THE VERY IMPORTANT PROBLEM WITH THIS ITEM IS THAT EVEN THOUGH IT MATCHED UP, THE 4 PLASTIC HOOKS THAT ARE ON THE ORIGINAL PART, WAS NOT ON THIS PRODUCT!  THE 4 PIECES OF PLASTIC THAT SHOULD HAVE HOOKED THE HITCH COVER TO THE VEHICLE WERE JUST STRAIGHT PIECES OF PLASTIC WITH NO HOOK ON THE END.  THEREFORE, THIS PRODUCT WOULD NOT STAY IN PLACE ON MY VEHICLE.  IT DID NOT WORK BUT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH THAT MY REPAIRMAN WAS ABLE TO PROCURE AN ORIGINAL GMC PRODUCT; HE PAINTED IT AND PUT THAT GMC PART ON MY VEHICLE.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!  NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED!  HAS CERTAINLY SOURED ME ON WANTING TO BUY ANYTHING ELSE FROM AMAZON!!!  OVER A HUNDRED DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN!!  TOO MAD TO EVEN FOOL WITH SENDING IT BACK  OR EVEN NOTIFYING ANYONE ABOUT THIS.  JUST CHALKED IT UP TO A VERY BAD INTERNET PURCHASE EXPERIENCE.  I HAVE A DISABLED HUSBAND WHOM I TAKE CARE OF AND DON'T HAVE TIME TO DEAL WITH EVERYTHING AND THEREFORE MY PRIORITIES ARE HIM AND NOT BEING RIPPED OFF FOR A PART THAT DIDN'T WORK. AND NO, I CAN'T SEND IT BACK-IT WAS LEFT AT THE SHOP AND PROBABLY THROWN AWAY!  AFTER ALL, WHO CAN USE A PLASTIC PART THAT WON'T WORK?
B001NQ2WO2|4|works ok not a chamois replacement since it does not hold much water.  Works for cleaning the interior glass.
B000E8OTIC|3|leaking already
B000EFERIC|5|works great quite large
B00407TTPG|5|Worked well, for a spray can, good for job at hand & other minor touch-up
B010BWT0IE|5|Head lamp was a piece of cake to install. The passing lamps had to have the factory HD plug removed and the included plug spiced in, otherwise a simple install.
B00KL0OTDS|1|I'm very disappointed in this product and recommend that if your manufacturer makes a specific one for your car, that you get that instead.<br /><br />Fit: The item doesn't fit the windshield, there are 1 inch gaps on the left and right, and a 1/2&#34; gap on the top.<br /><br />Performance: I saw absolutely zero drop in how hot it was in my car for the week that I used it.<br /><br />After this failed purchase I was hesitant to buy another, however I borrowed a car club members Subaru sunshade and there was actually a difference in temperature, plus the fit was perfect.<br /><br />Bottom line: Sometimes aftermarket brands have much more bang for your buck, this isn't one of those times.  Poor fit and bad performance lead me to give this a 1 star.
B00480KPLW|1|Supposed to be an upgrade from the stockroom bulbs. Long story short the stockroom bulbs are back in.
B000IY80ZU|5|Centric has always delivered on quality and consistency at a great price
B001F4VWYS|5|For the price this works. If you have a good capacity air compressor already why buy a electric motor vacuum. It has a plastic case with metal body inside. Would buy again. I did find any quality issues with this product. Just plan on a shut off p ball valve and a filter as per the manufacture and your set to vaccum an automobiles a/c system.
B00316K61S|5|Used to test my marine 12v batteries. Works just fine. It does get very hot, but it's supposed to as it is an electrical load and needs to dissipate heat. Easy to operate.
B00UR6GQXM|4|Being used around the Fire Houses here and they work fine. We had problems with towel drying and scratcing the clear coat. No longer a problem with the wiper blade and Absorber shamy.
B00F6GKKQC|1|I ended up using them once and they started to shred and bend. there not made out of good metal
B00U254RNE|5|I used this knob to replace the broken plastic choke one on my Harley Davidson. Why pay through the nose. I love the satin finish, anything that was chrome or polished I had powder coated black or have taken a 3m pad to.
B000JWKE3C|5|Gives my 10 year old truck a &#34;new truck&#34; ride.
B00W8LQLGQ|1|Absolute junk dont buy it.
B000NOCC9K|5|Just what we needed for a business traveler.
B004A2EIFM|5|Outstanding product!!!
B006N93158|5|Great quality and easy to install
B00U65S2OA|5|I received the tool set at least 1-day earlier than expected, which was great! I used this tool set to replace the factory radio in my Avalon.  The tools worked well, and it was good to know that I was not making any marks on my interior while working on my car.  I highly-recommend these tools and it is even nicer that they come in the handy tool bag for storage and later use.
B00029JL04|1|VERY POOR DESIGN COIL CONNECTERS TOO WEAK STUDS WILL BREAK IF U TIGHTEN TOO MUCH,BEWARE
B00DWGAL9E|2|Should've put the money towards a better quality rack.
B00BPZAFFO|5|fit just right. Not sure of coverage as our radio is not working like it should.
B002VGAXN0|5|Excellent Eta on purchase and good quality.
B007SAKLRC|5|perfect size very durable excellent price
B000C9NOOS|4|works well, the electrical connector is a little larger than original making installation slightly more difficult
B001TEU1U0|5|Everything that was expected
B00AQWZQME|5|Will see how they stand up after some use. Requires some time being shipped from China.
B00E16LVYI|5|Battery arrived in easy to open shipping container and was fully charged! Price was higher than some other sites but I am still satisfied.
B00YSXUYTW|5|Very good valve,good quality, easy to install.my motorcycle auto shut-off didn't  work one day and put gas on my garage floor.This is reason I put the fuel shut off on.No more problem!
B000JZI3WS|5|Perfect fit ...arrived quickly
B000Y82MHW|5|Nice wellade
B00JMD4B9M|5|Badass
B00E9RRY04|5|Pretty amazing pants. Really comfortable and padding in all the right places. I've always wore otb pants but due to my new boots having big shin plates had to go inside now. Plus got em for way cheaper than msrp can't beat that.
B004303LMC|5|Very happy with this.  I had purchased a black  leather Tod's tote bag on eBay.  The bag was in great condition but there were tiny little flea bits in the edges of the glazing and the leather at the seams of the rolled handles had become rubbed.  I applied the Fiebing's with a Q-tip.  The edges are much improved -- not perfect, but so much better than before.  I am sure I will have to reapply eventually but it is good to know that I can continue to keep this bag looking good.  Very easy to use, and a very inexpensive but worthwhile  remedy .
B00BQVF8J0|5|Fast shipping works great
B0009IQX0E|2|Its not the greatest wax. It is average
B00BITHYWO|5|Great value, shipped immediately, worked like a charm.
B00PV6W2KO|5|Quality product and good shipping!
B0016KABFC|3|Haven't installed it yet.  But it appears, if I turn the crank the right way, the strap will wind around the spool.
B000XSCEBM|1|this jack is a piece of cheap garbage. used it twice and on the second attempt only to raise my truck front tire the seals blew and all of the oil spilled out. dont buy it, buy another brand. still looks brand new but it cannot be used again unless it is rebuilt of replaced.
B01037HBCY|5|Fits perfect and looks great on my fz-09
B00SS3S54O|5|perfect fit perfect, match
B0014BBP7G|4|Seem to work fine, no installation problems like the matching front ones had due to faulty hardware kit
B00PYQC75G|1|I got Tuape  color  instead  of  the  beige .  Doesn't match  with front seat BDK biege
B00BUL96H6|5|They worked perfectly! Excellent product! !!
B005N72KTE|5|Nice well made shirt, cuffs are excellent.
B00IN5BS4G|5|Installed a week ago on my 1997 Toyota Camry 4 cylinder. Rides much higher and smoother. A pleasure to drive.
B003KU497W|4|Fit good and was a good price
B004VS1N6W|5|Great replacement mirror..came with all harware to install..quick 5 minute install works perfect
B001F770VE|5|it works fine!
B004I113D0|5|Good web site. I will use it again.
B006YU7G8E|3|Its a great product and you should switch out your power steering fluid every so often as it can get caustic and start eating hoses and eventually teeth of the steering mechanism, but changing it is far from perfect. Pumping out as much as possible the refilling with new fluid, then driving for a bit, only to repeat the procedure another 2 times, just to get the majority of the darkened fluid out, is a pain and you need to store power steering fluid in a separate bottle for recycle than the oils, tranny fluid, differential fluid and even brake fluid. Kind of a pain that could probably be worth a trip to the dealer or trusted Honda repair place just to avoid this hassle.
B008CFC4HC|5|Got this for my car and it was perfect
B00ZRW1KH8|2|Mounting instructions a little vague. Installation is between the rubber seal and the glass!!?? Should have spent a couple extra dollars for a better set.
B000GV0U7G|4|As expected
B009IULJMG|5|Very nice. I put it on my 1995 Troy Bilt tractor.
B00OKXQ6S8|5|These were buggers to get on but may have been heat n humidity but on now n look great.
B000BZCPKW|2|bought it because the lead wires were white/silver but they are not
B0067ED1S6|4|nice filter<br />good price<br />one thing i don't like is there is no fluting (unlike the picture shows)at the bottom for easy removal with a filter cup.<br />i guess k&n are trying to show the importance of the welded on not from their gold series .<br />this is the only filter i had in a long time without flutes on the bottom .<br />i've been using the filter cups for 15 years on many cars and love them .<br />hate when it not there . now i gotta buy a new tool for removal
B009TCAZKK|4|Works great, fast shipping.
B010SQRL1Q|3|Works as expected. I had to tweak it a bit on arrival. Couple of screws need to be tightened.
B0041G1C0Q|5|fast shipping and great item..
B00877SL2M|4|USED IN INSTRUMENT CLUSTER IN A 94 DODGE TRUCK. WORK FINE BUT NOT THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN LIGHT. WOULD NOT WORK FOR THE BLINKER INDICATORS.
B00FHSHWHO|5|Great helmet
B005JVFBUY|5|Bought this to do my front & rear differential in my 14 Toyota Tundra 4x4 with 20,000 miles. Thankfully I didn't wait any longer as both were very dirty. Although I don't notice any difference in how it feels or sounds I can attest to improved mpg. I've since driven 2200 miles and my mpg has improved 1 mpg! I bought the case which will do 2 changes. Redline recommended to me to change after 30-40k more miles.
B004SFY75M|5|My son was able to install this in his 2002 Lexis IS300. You can rent the gauges required for proper pressure adjustments, at Auto Zone. Works great, and nice cold air!
B00LNAILW0|5|Just right!
B000F23GOK|5|Very satisfied
B00A6AS6LY|5|did everything that it advertised to do, simple to use and easy clean up
B00JF5LRN0|5|Works really well.
B00SYFXKKU|2|Bought. Then found they do not line up with the valves. 95 lt1 corvette.
B005NLQAHS|5|I got Bluetooth working not wifi. It works as it says it does. App needs some updating visually though.
B003QHDLEQ|5|Great quality. Use all the time.
B00LUS6YH4|5|Fit my 1993 Del Sol perfectly!
B004GF0CIK|5|Looks great and came on time
B009ZIMXLW|5|Fit perfectly.
B00JF5F420|5|Works great
B001KOYYRA|5|Good product
B00842A7F4|5|good
B0006VORDY|5|Great value. Super heat output. Perfect for wok cooking. Boils huge pot of pasta water in no time at all. Fries beautifully.
B002528B3E|5|Thank you!
B008VPUOSO|3|Arrived with damaged threads on the tie rod that had to be filed out before use. Additionally, one of the tie rod grease boots was damaged and had to be replaced. Product bolted directly in, and is a much more substantial part than the original. Immediately had an alignment done and went on a 3000 mile road trip and had no concerns.
B00JIARQ1O|5|Instructions were great; just watch out for the grounding screw (the one with the black wire) there is a golden nut that needs to be aligned when putting it back together.
B000EG6CS4|5|Perfect!
B0041TP4UM|5|Perfect replacement. Recieced and reinstalled . great service
B00DSD4HF0|4|Yes it arrived quickly and it is colorful but, it was a tad small. I wish it was an inch bigger.
B000EQB6NU|3|Did not fit my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4.7 HO
B007KLPOMG|5|Good fit took a little work to get them in but other than that perfect, they look sweet
B000CN5GTK|5|Worked great as the front suspension bump stops on my 2003 Ford Excursion 4x4.  Would also work great as the rear axle leaf spring bump stops for the same vehicle.
B000FQ0EC8|5|Has everything you need to complete a tune-up<br />Great quality better then the auto parts store's and cheaper price
B00XAEXJCE|5|[[VIDEOID:364431a8e166250f558add602d258457]]How perfect is this GeekTek Cup Holder Auto Charge Station you ask?  In my opinion you can't get much better than this!!! I am a very busy mommy, and I own a business that thrives on cell phones, and with a 3 year old, I always have DVD or tablet (or both) going when I am in the car.  And it never fails, they all seem to die at the same time!!! And of course only 12V slots in my car!!! What to do! Just put this in the cup holder, and BAM all 4 devices are charging and I can continue on with my busy day! This is so great and convenient, you will wonder how you ever survived without it, I know I do!<br />I was provided a sample at a discounted price to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.

B00G2TV7OG|5|I put these in my truck and am very happy with the improvement over standard bulbs.  Well worth the money and time to install them
B00CHDEZVS|1|Didn't fit. Don't even bother
B007UMFONE|5|Well pleased
B00M78820I|5|I purchased my shade 8 months ago and it is still going strong.  It fits my SUV quite well too.
B000E28J0C|5|Item came quickly and fit as described.
B003OSIHXW|1|I bought mine at Costco. I wish I had seen the reviews here. These are the only blades I have ever had that failed and didn't just wear out. I live in California so they are not put to a lot of use either. The rubber blade separated from the plastic holder. It is not possible to get it back into the grove.
B00H7LPKKU|5|I fixed it on the straight extension on my air grease gun.  It works well.  I am gong to put it on a flex hose to see which works best.  I may buy another one.  So far, I have a lot less mess with old fittings that run in the mud and water. I clean them off and shoot the grease to them.  It does well on the fitting in hard to reach places in U-joints.
B00CFPIYUG|4|Useful, but small in size.
B00842A7F4|5|Great product!! Replaced all em on my civic front bumper.
B004HCS4PK|5|Easily the best wax I have ever used. My car looks better than when I drove it off the lot.
B001KSCSQU|1|No it said it would work but was wrong for my truck had to return it
B000C9DINK|5|Finally, I can breathe again!
B004AQZUX2|5|Great set of bulbs. Crystal white as promised with just a touch of blue.
B005WXDQ1A|1|Seemed to work OK for a month or two, but started to tear and disintegrate after about 3-4 months outside.  7 year warranty, but you have to pay to ship it - probably cost about $25 to ship, and if you're just going to get back another one that doesn't last is it really worth it?  Probably not.  I hope there are better options out there, 4 months lifetime is not good...
B001DRJN5M|4|This was NOT a perfect fit for my 2001 Hyundai Elantra (as Amazon indicated it would be) - I was able to get it in, but it's considerably tighter than the typical &#34;snug&#34; I would expect. I'm sure it will work okay, but be aware of this issue.
B000O0E890|5|Bought bib to cover minor scratches on rear fender after replacing the stock 2-up seat with a solo seat.  The bib was easy to install and performed as I had hoped.
B004YEJ7KC|5|Great product and service.
B00PV6U1N4|5|Always getting compliments
B00852684M|4|Pretty good stuff. Don't forget to remove the paper by the batteries.
B00K539SJG|5|works great
B009FU4LEW|5|Very great. Perfect fit for zr2 oem.
B008I2MO74|5|Great filter no more musty smell
B00YE360TO|3|Excellent fit but hard to remove if you need access to what's stored below. No cutout or notch to accommodate accessories plugged in to the power port below.
B00LGXI3B8|5|Perfect fit.  Protects seat back.  Quick install.
B00LNG6BXU|4|Very sturdy and liked the fabric.  Good value for the money....
B004SQHO74|5|Works for 2006 gmc Duramax
B004N9BRJ2|1|There's a good reason this rack has all the features of a much more expensive rack at an unbelievable price, because it's garbage. This thing sways all over the place like it's made of rubber because the pieces holding it together are way too flimsy. I've already ordered a new one and will just dump this POS rather subject anyone else to the horror of worrying when this WILL finally break.
B009R3Q4RE|4|Works good.
B00B79XIQ6|5|I love it, it's perfect with my purple accented miata and fits just right.  I did not know but there are two suction cups that really help it to stay in position.  Good design!
B008YFTKUY|1|Ordered a set after reading good reviews well I ordered low beam bulbs..plug it in doesn't work..the directions that come with it are terrible! Will never order from this company again!
B004YNQ404|4|Both panels fit well in this bag. The padding seems nice and thick. Works great.
B00E0IK9DQ|5|Loved the kit. Brought it to my local shop (non-dealer) and they loved seeing it as a set also. Mine was JT Sprockets and DID Xring chain. Saved me $160 from dealer cost and $65 less than my local shop.  Takes some of the apprehension away from buying parts online that will work with your bike. This went on a 2011 V-Strom (DL650).
B00F8PMVHW|5|put this on my 1997 dodge Dakota fit and works just like the original  and it was a lot cheaper that what my local part store wanted for one
B0116C00EG|1|Horrible quality the vinyl wouldn't even come of the right sheet of paper making it impossible to transfer it over without deformation and air bubbles
B005G5EAGE|5|Itet all my expecations
B00KWMP6ZA|3|Mats are heavy rubber and thus far appear high quality for the price. Downside the material there made of stinks which we remedied by getting air fresheners.
B00LG6GIQC|5|worth it!
B001SLAMSK|3|paint peels off
B00GUF74HQ|1|A piece of junk.  I followed the installation instructions exactly.  After 7.5 turns of the nutsert installation tool it broke free and the nutsert would not install.  Worse part is I have to pay almost $7.00 to return it.  I wouldn't bother with this product.
B004EDCR0U|1|I ordered these and they did not fit my Yakima rack at all, the holes are too small, and there is a &#34;no return&#34; policy. I didn't realize there are different style straps. Other reviews point out the same problem, so not sure why the description does not get changed. If I would have read the reviews it would have made me look into it a little more.
B0070Y9CE4|5|Exactly what I needed for my BMW X5 E70. Recommended
B000CNAV1I|5|A good sealer
B0031GHBU2|5|really happy with the product quality, as well super fast shipping
B00C6BX1JI|1|Well my name is Joel and I bought these shocks August 2015 to put on my 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I thought these were my cheapest, best alternative for replacing the old ones that were completely shot, but I was wrong. Went to install them and they don't work. They won't ever work unless they start to manufacture them differently. It's as simple as that. The braces are at a 90 degree angle and do not allow the shock to sit how it properly should nor do they allow for the shock to be connected to the ball on the car itself. If you are buying shocks for a 94 Jeep Grand Cherokee, do not get these. Invest in shocks that are one piece(shock and bracket already connected) and ones that have a swivel ball connection between the shock and brace.
B006P86TG0|5|High quality patch
B0049MTGXM|4|Fit great on my 07 Civic Coupe and I watched the YouTube installation video a coupe of times.<br />My only concern is I live in the rust belt state and noticed rust in one of the unibody mounting holes.<br />This is for a bicycle carrier basket maybe a small trailor .
B001DRLQN4|5|easy fit. easy to replace. appears well made. will use again.
B0051ZHBII|5|Works just as good as name brands
B002ZTGNBO|5|Happy with the door lock. Shipping was fast and installation really easy.
B002VPL6AA|5|My mechanic installed them on my 2006 Chevy express 2500 cargo van and fits like a charm , with the ac delco pads 2 months ago and no complaints at all
B007SWVZES|5|Works well would buy again
B00252928M|5|This is a top quality filter. Fits great with plenty of pleats plus a foam pre-filter to stop larger particles. It is recommended by BMW and the only one I will use.
B00CAMGP00|3|I like the design and finish of these mirrors but they are really small on my Vulcan 1700. (See photos)<br />I had a problem mounting the right mirror as the base accepts 10MM reversed thread same as the left side, and for what reason they included three (two of them are standard 10mm which they are useless in my case and the 3rd is 10mm reversed thread which works)<br />Will search or maybe contact the manufacturer if they can send me another reversed one.<br /><br />This is an update... I've tried both mirrors side by side (new one on the left vs the stock mirror on the right)  while riding on my bike I noticed that the new one vibrates a lot while the stock mirror isn't, maybe the large area of view on the stock is why its less noticeable.
B00BJ7Z3EQ|1|Cheap. Keeper tabs are misshapen and they won't stay on my wheels.
B00HRIHYOS|5|This is great, sturdy! Fast shipping, will order from this company again
B007M47SW0|1|I purchased the 5 pack of the relays and harnesses. The relays and harnesses I received are only 4 wire and one of the wires isn't even copper. I would not recommend these to anyone.
B000E7YP82|5|I was really impressed with the quality of this bag.  Thick materials, heavy-duty straps, and tapered/aerodynamic design.  The bungee straps do a great job of cinching down any excess space left in the bag.  The extra strap material never came loose traveling 75mph down the freeway.  No excessive noise.  The easiest way to fill it completely is to place some softer/conforming items up against the top of the bag.<br /><br />Note:  This bag fits perfectly inside a Thule Canyon 859 Roof Basket!
B00230IOJ4|5|I have used this chain wax for 15 years and it has performed great. My XR650R had put it to the test many times in sand and mud. Would recommend to anyone.
B00MY4Y3P8|4|Fits perfectly into my 2001 Tundra for a great price. There were no instructions but that was expected. However, the instructions on the pack of lube merely indicated to put it onto moving parts only. I placed a bit of lube along the edges of the pads that were in contact with the caliper. Unlike the originals and the first replacements, this set does not have a separate thin metal backing plate. The backing is already fused/glued to the the back of the pads. The only downside is that the pads were packed loosely in an oversized box. There was no packing material to prevent the pads from jostling around. Other pads that I've bought online come in smaller boxes or are shrink-wrapped together to prevent movement, but not these.There was a slight chip in one of the pads and the pack of lube had a small hole probably from being bounced around in the box.
B007TYFZH8|4|Fit like the Ford Factory made it
B0042KJV9U|5|Perfect!
B00S5FE9MC|5|its great
B001G4Z5J0|5|We took this rack on our 3000 mile round trip to Florida. Loaded it with the cooler and stroller and couple large bags. Worked great! We had a ton more room in the car. Zero complaints.

B00CW8ODTW|5|Works & looks great easy install I had a question regarding the product and the owner of the company got back to me in minutes Amazing customer service! I am a client for life.
B007CMD65U|1|This product did not fit our<br />2005 Ford Exployer.
B00DMNBRVS|3|works ok
B00S6OXWMK|2|Did not match my 2010 Alpine White III 328i BMW at all! Took a month for delivery ALSO. they were very nice and help via email speaking with them so not all bad.
B006A6H5EM|3|Great look on my Mini Cooper. Easy to install BUT you have to buy extra cable. The supplied cable is way too short.
B000E2CVDI|5|WE USE THIS OIL FILTER FOR OUR SUZUKI M109R..RESULTS ARE A VERY CLEAN ENGINE.
B00M9MULL0|5|love it!
B00O2I5ILM|5|liked it so much I ordered a second one for my girlfriends car!
B001C6NQOS|5|worked perfect was right fit well pleased with this item
B00THR39SC|4|one of the flares came with no double sticky tape on them .I had to put<br />my own on.They also shorted me 3 clips that attach them to the fender.<br />i think they are lacking on quality control.the place that i bought them from took care of<br />my problem and reimbursed me for my expenses.would buy from them again.
B005OZNZD0|1|Couldn't get them cut....wrong type of metal.....sending them back
B0062V2VIK|1|Damaged beyond use!!! Returned.
B00FFTGCTE|5|Very good quality
B00943S48E|5|I love it
B00JRE38EA|5|Perfect product.
B000OZS9Y0|5|Good product.
B00WWYVHJ0|5|This gets lots of comments! Very cool.
B00V2XHMBY|5|Bad ass light , I love it and will be getting another for truck. No moisture problems an I live n Florida and it's raining season and still gets soaked and works fine.
B004SFKJIQ|5|It was great, now I do not miss my nice trailer so much.  It make tent camping so much nicer!
B00GTXSB9Y|1|Metal is too thin and bends too easily.  The &#34;red&#34; is not chili pepper red and is not even close to matching the car color.<br /><br />I put the original back on the key fog due to the thin metal bending where it separates to attach.
B00AU5YSLW|5|This is the best license plate I love it and recommend it to everyone
B005C43YHU|5|Simply, this stuff works! This isn't an Armor-All type of product. Follow the simple instructions and you will be happy with the result.
B000E8V9ZI|5|I really like Purolator oil filters, and my research found them to be one of the best on the market today.  Without opening the canister to examine the filter material myself I will trust the results others have found.
B000C2WFA4|5|Replaced our old gas cap perfectly. Only wish it was attachable to compartment for security purposes.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Good stuff
B000EDOSS8|5|Easy installe Took 1 Hour to Replace All 4
B00MQGFQRS|5|I bought this for my 2001 CRV.  It fit beautifully and really served its purpose.  I would buy it again.
B001EOV2Y4|5|Delivered as expected. Easy install.
B00JXS3BXI|3|The 2nd time I used this winch the roller broke on me, which made my cable snap. Also, as one other review said, sometimes it's hard to switch the clutch from free spool back to engaged. You have to pull a little cable out and keep trying until it finally goes back. But for the price it's alright. Just don't depend on the cable rollers it comes with.
B0002MAB8W|5|works as what it was intended for
B00279D0FE|5|Went on easily--much more easily than the old one came off.  Has worked well since.
B007O5GWNI|5|I use this controller in a Comercial truck. It allows use of both electric and electric over hydraulic trailer brakes with easy to understand instructions.
B0061TU2JS|5|Slid right in and worked perfectly in my wife's 2010 Honda Odyssey
B004B61B34|5|Just installed this products 3 weeks ago, seems to be durable and well made, easy installation although I did take the bumper off which takes about 5 minutes. Taking off the bumper made it a whole lot easier to install. Did not instal the wiring harness yet so can't comment on its function or installation.
B000N37C3C|1|Flimsy, and it came with residue (salt/residue from bluing?) on it. It rubbed off though (see pic)
B005OZN300|5|Just what I hoped I would get. Worked great!
B002GO93I8|5|Perfect fit. Nice!
B00WN5BM3E|5|Great product. It's the perfect size for washing the car generally, but also getting into the nooks and crannies and detail areas. I also like the 2 in 1 function, with a scrubber on the back. Holds a lot of water and soap. Mitts and sponges I have had in the past often fall apart, but not this one. Recommended!
