B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game! And I can't believe that it was free! I am going to play this for so long, it's not going to be fun any more but I don't care!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|lots of fun just a few downfalls. I just don't like you have to pay for each game. directions should be clearer.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is so fun but it gets a little harder at the later levels. Still can't believe that its free!!
B0068RHSZO|1.0|This is one of the worst movies of 2011. Who ever wrote the script, produced and directed this movie should be ashamed. Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and especially Naomi Watts talents are totally squandered.  The advertising for this movie entirely misrepresents what type of movie it is. Don't waste your time or your money.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|We purchased this case for our granddaughters kindle. It snaps on tightly . It is a hard case which will protect the kindle if it is accidentally dropped. The pink color is perfect for girls.
B0073Q0DZG|2.0|I never thought a film with Steve Martin, Owen Wilson and Jack Black would be completely devoid of any humor but with the added topic of bird watching, it's staggering that this movie was ever written, let alone produced. The film is set around a competition to spot as many birds as possible within the US in a single year but acts as a metaphor for the personal problems in each of their years.<br /><br />Martin is a big-shot lawyer whose entire firm can't survive a couple of days without him. Wilson keeps ditching his wife whenever a short-tailed sparrow bat is mentioned. Black can't get his life together, losing a career and a wife to bird watching, which appears to be pretty expensive. Naturally, all three discover how to fix these problems while peering through binoculars at our CGI feathered friends.<br /><br />The Big Year isn't a comedy, nor a romance or drama. It's difficult to connect with the characters and understand their need to win the competition in the face of their own problems. It plods between talking heads scenes as characters criss-cross the country to identity birds. The three main characters were comically neutered and by the time the film was over, it was difficult to recount what had even happened. Overall, it's a missed opportunity given the talent involved. I don't know if bird watchers will like the film but based purely on entertainment, it completely misses the mark.
B001GXNBJW|5.0|What is there to say about this album.  Classic Black Keys before there was a classic Black Keys.  More of a stripped down sound when compared to their newer material.  However if you like their new stuff you will love this album.
B006IVBSBU|1.0|If you're looking for a film high on NWO themes and low on critical thinking and plot .... you've found it.  For example -- One of the \\"bad\\" guys questions the government and sells patent (fraud) medicine thru the internet.  You can find much higher quality entertainment anyday.

0307346609|5.0|I really liked this book. It was not your typical zombie action \\"movie\\" style book. It was incredibly well thought out, taking into account things i had never even dreamed of. Even without a defined \\"plot\\", per-se, it was still a page turner for sure. I would definitely recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great... classic solitaire at its best!  easy to play and lots of fun!  i love the auto finish option- more time to play
B001EOOQEC|5.0|I am thoroughly embarrassed and ashamed.<br /><br />I am a Sabbath fan and a Dio fan. I love solo Ozzy and the Ozzy era Sabbath, and I also love the Dio era Sabbath and his solo work. I remember seeing \\"Dehumanizer\\" in the record stores when it was released back in 1992. I just passed it by as it wasn't generating any noise from the record industry. In recent years I bought \\"The Dio Years\\" and it had a couple of tracks from \\"Dehumanizer\\" on it. The tracks were very good, and I thought, \\"I need to check out that album.\\"<br /><br />I just bought it. Wow. The album is incredible. As a fan of Black Sabbath I am ashamed that I let this awesome album slip by me for 20 years.<br /><br />Ronnie's vocals are just amazing. This album captures what may be some of the best vocal work of any Heavy Metal singer in history. Yes, he is that good on this album.<br /><br />Tony Iommi is doing what he does best: writing some intense, heavy riffs. I mean, this is sheer power. Wow. When a lot of other guys want to sound heavy, they write a fast-paced song. It takes a real creative talent to write a heavy-sounding song the way Tony does. He has a gift that enables him to punch out a slow groove than is so powerful it just forces you to bang your head. I challenge any metal head to listen to this album and NOT find themselves banging their head at some point. There is not a weak track on this album.<br /><br />Geezer Butler and Vinny Appice are the two others on the albums lineup. They are two incredible musicians, and they are showing their talents here. Geezer truly is one of the greatest metal bassists ever. Vinny is a true pro and adds thunderous drums to this classic album.<br /><br />As I said this album did not get a lot of attention from the record industry back in 1992 when it came out. I should have known better. I do know better. This is the same industry that was turning its back on this kind of music in favor of grunge at this time. Because I have ignored this album for 20 years I am ashamed, and it has been my loss.
B005N95JA4|1.0|This is a four-star album (the last good Stones album), but one-star rating here is due to deceptive depiction of album packaging on Amazon. I ordered this after observing that the posted album art photos(numbers 3 through 5) replicated the original album artwork -- complete with cut out faces and the missing starlet photos that were long ago removed from the record. But on the deluxe version I got, there are no cut outs or restoration of the missing faces -- it is simply the \\"censored\\" printed cover you see in the first two album photos. This is very misleading and dishonest -- apparently someone has simply  posted photos of the old record cover. These images should be deleted. If there truely is a \\"double-deluxe\\" version you have to order to get the original album packaging, it should be made clear.
B006ZEEHQS|1.0|had long since I last saw a movie so bad.<br />is very poorly managed and is very difficult to re-watch a movie with the same cast<br />I'm sorry but I have to say in truth.

B000RK73LW|5.0|Loreena McKennett's music is always fantasic and very easy to listen too. This was purchased for my wife and she has a number of Loreena's albums and this is a great addition to her collection. The seller sent this item out quickly and it was very well described.
B005CMSDLE|3.0|Hanna is a slightly different spin concerning action storylines where the good guy has to run from the bad guy.  In this case the \\"good guy\\" is a powerful assassin who's actually a little blonde-haired girl.  She can kick butt and take no names, and even defeat upwards of 5 or 6 operatives at the same time who possess their own special abilities and gun-wielding ways.  With that said, this isn't *quite* a Matrix-style film.  It's close to it, however.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's two reasons I'm not particularly thrilled with the end result.  The first reason is that the beginning, at least the first 20 minutes, is quite confusing.  You're totally unsure what's going on- all you know is that a little girl is in the middle of a snowy forest and is an extraordinary fighter of sorts.  It's unclear what's going on until... well, without spoiling what happens, until she makes a critical, life-changing decision.  This *dramatically* changes the direction of the storyline and then begins to make perfect sense.<br /><br />The other reason this film is average at best is the fact that the little girl is supposed to be running from a group of operatives who try desperately to contain the girl but... a good chunk of the storytelling doesn't actually focus on the running but instead focuses on the girls friendship with another girl she meets out in the desert, and this takes up a really big chunk of the movie.  At least 45 minutes of it.  It's pretty excessive to me.<br /><br />However the 3 stars means I DID like Hanna overall.  The segments where Hanna unleashes her special butt-kicking talents on anyone she sees fit (and I mean *anyone*, haha) are easily the parts of the film that impress me the most.  It's not a gripping storyline by any means, and I'd say it's even lackluster for the most part, but at least the final 25 minutes is really suspenseful.  Oh and the description is actually correct.  It IS part adventure/part suspense.  This means kids might find it too violent, but the language is hardly ever extreme.  Not much (if any) swearing for example.<br /><br />Overall, had about 30 minutes of the film been trimmed I believe would have benefited the film.  I would have then given the movie a higher rating.
B0070R40V6|5.0|Diversified, reading & listening. Top ebook I wish that would be on kindle hardware available. Unfortunately its not. Nevertheless I like this style. I can't stop reading. Hopefully the following stories will be available, soon.
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Year of the Cat is a phenomenal album!  At the risk of sounding like a biased fanboy, I can say with absolute confidence- there's not even a *remotely* weak moment in any single area of the entire record.  I now have a greater appreciation for the title song instead of hearing it endlessly on classic rock radio- it works a LOT better in the context of this album, believe me, because now you can really grasp the storytelling aspect of the lyrics.<br /><br />Elsewhere you have tracks such as \\"Lord Grenville\\" and \\"One Stage Before\\" which both take listeners on an eerie, folk-rock imaginative journey thanks to the vocal melody and solid use of the arrangements.  \\"Broadway Hotel\\" totally resembles Ian Anderson from Jethro Tull and that's a GREAT thing in my book (BIG Tull fan I am I am says I!) The violin is absolutely perfect for this track as well.<br /><br />\\"If It Doesn't Come Naturally, Leave It\\" and \\"Flying Sorcery\\" are both fantastic upbeat pop songs revealing Al Stewart's ability to deliver a pop-like vocal melody and make both tracks stand proud with the best of them from the mid 70's.<br /><br />Oh wow, I HAVE in fact heard \\"On the Border\\" before!  This song was a hit wasn't it?  I definitely remember hearing it several times... somewhere before.  I can't recall where exactly.  The vocals and arrangements always reminded me of a sunny beach and a nice walk across a bridge watching the seagulls play with each other in the distance.  \\"Sand In Your Shoes\\" actually doesn't remind me of beaches despite the \\"sand\\" in the title, haha.  Oh well.  It DOES remind me of falling in love with a certain special somebody though!<br /><br />Year of the Cat is definitely Al Stewart's best album in my opinion.  Yes he may very well have a few underrated albums under his belt, but here?  This is where Al gave it everything he had and what an album it is.  I can see myself hearing it 30 years from now and still loving it just as much then as I do now, seriously.  Pick it up.
B003WTE886|4.0|This album is typically Taylor Swift. You know what you are going to get and that is OK. I enjoyed it and as usual for her songs, they all come from the heart or her relationships!

0393338398|5.0|Moneyball is much more than a book about baseball. I't a book about courage, confidence, and vision. The strength to withstand scrutiny from the very fabric of an industry and stay the course. Billy Beane's vision changed the architecture of an American icon but beyond that he gave those of us in the business world  peek into the roadmap to change our own industries.<br />Professionally I have incorporated the preface and the first half of the book in my creation of a vision and effort to \\"change the game\\".
B005HSL626|2.0|I absolutely love this game and its sooo fun but after I unlocked all of the blades and backgrounds it stopped working.

B00003CXBH|5.0|Well so many others have written such nice reviews about this movie so I won't go there. For myself, there are only so many pieces of art whether its an actual painting or a recording of music or statue or a book or in this case cinema that has a profound effect on my conscious or my soul. Some would refer to them as masterpieces. For me, this Masterpiece of cinema The Mission is one of those works because its more than just a story. For me the relation to this movies runs deep and even though the story takes place during the time of the Jesuits, to me it represents the common struggles of man which you can easily draw parallels to what's happening today. Its all around us in our hypocrisies we ignore daily as we steadily consume just the same as the Portuguese. If I watch this movie alone, I cry because we can not stop ourselves and we destroy so much...
B004UQ03P2|5.0|This thing is a little pricey compared to the $10 stuff you find on here. I wish it was price around $30 instead of $40 but it's worth it if you don't want the glare on your macbook pro 13.<br /><br />Super easy application, it's not one big sticky film like the other ones where you only have one shot at application. It does this by creating a giant \\"bubble\\" so only the sticky part are on the outside edges. It's advertised to be able to take it off and reapply, but I have not had to do that yet.<br /><br />So far I've been pleased, I wish apple would just have an option for anti-glare, but this will work.

0385512058|5.0|When a friend suggested I read this book, I mentally rolled my eyes. I borrowed it from the library and read the first chapter. I immediately bought the hardback, so I could underline and mark key passages. I expected to receive instructions on how to expand my network, but what I learned was how to plan, assess and execute a lifelong networking strategy. As a shy person, I have had to overcome my own social awkwardness by trial and error. I wish this book had been available 30 years ago.  There is a lot of useful information; it is one of the best networking book I have ever read. If you are looking for work, trying to get promoted or simply building a strong network, you must read this book.

B005LRWRZ8|3.0|I'm a huge Megadeth fan, as are most people writing reviews. Their last two albums where fantastic. U.A. was a great return to the classic sound I loved. The lyrics were clever, cynical with great political undertones. Endgame was Megadeth at their absolute peak of musical and lyrical perfection. It just couldn't get any better than that. All I wanted was something close to the quality of their last two albums. Sorry folks, you're not gonna get it on this album. What a disappointment! This album is worse than Trust; it's a vain attempt at trying to accomplish what Trust was not able to. Take a look at who wrote the songs, and you will see something very interesting. A lot of co-writing on this album with people I have no idea who they are; not band members. Now look at who wrote Endgame. All Dave except for a couple of small bits from band members. Dave writes the best stuff, and the proof is in the song credits. If I could return this album I would. I was so excited after Endgame, I bought the special picture disc vinyl version, which cost a pretty penny. If I would have gotten this package for Endgame, I'd be very happy.<br /><br />Too bad this album came out after his book signing tour. I met him for the signing, and would have told him how disappointing this album was. But like they say, if you don't have anything good to say, keep your mouth shut. Still I felt the need to inform other Megadeth fans of what they are spending their money on. All we can do is wait till the next album.

B005I4JG80|5.0|The marketing for this book was so flawed; until I read the sample I assumed it was a parenting manual. It isn't. It's more a cross between a very good parenting memoir and an anthropological study of the upper-middle-class Parisian parent. I'm sure Ms Druckerman had an inkling of the minor firestorm any \\"critique\\" of American parenting would ignite, but let's be fair. To fully implement the techniques described, one would have to move to Paris. This is, of course, impractical and even the author found it difficult to throw off her own cultural practices to fully embrace the ones used by her French peers, which she readily admits. The American examples often seem to be parodies of, well, American neuroticism (hearing any mother say \\"I'm only as happy as my least-happy child\\" might prompt the reply, \\"please feel free to not share any other masochist practices you might engage in\\"), but I have heard some doozies dropped from the lips of some sleep-deprived mothers. It helps that Druckerman's writing itself is breezy and engaging. And, frankly, sometimes it's nice to be reminded of the basics - be calm, be patient, and, above all, be the parent. We may not have the French creches or maternelles (the image of twenty-plus identical crayon drawings did strike me as tres creepy), but there is no reason our children can't \\"awaken\\" and learn respect and self-reliance. And maybe, using some of Druckerman's advice, I can get my kids to polish off their haricot verts, too.  Ahhhh, a parent can dream.

B0000025T6|5.0|This is Springsteen's best album ever! This is one of those albums where the power does not lie in volume, but in the lyrics. I'm a newcomer to The Boss and his music. I thought I'd might as well give Nebraska a shot, and I must say, as I was reading the lyrics along with the music, the emotions in The Boss's words hit you hard. The indifference of the character on the song Nebraska, who's about to be executed, saying \\"...and I killed everything in my path\\", haunts you with it's soft, almost eerie delivery. It's a perfect intro of what's to come in the next 40 minutes on the album.<br /><br />These songs are all about people driven to desperation through tough times, wishing they had more, and never has Bruce passed on these stories more effectively. The wording of the lyrics is guaranteed to have you picturing the stories unfolding, the best example being \\"Highway Patrolman\\", a story that would make anyone feel pity for the main character.<br /><br />Musically, the songs are perfect in their demo quality style. The stories are really what the focus of this album is, and the emotions that come from these stories are where the impact of this album lies, the guitar and harmonica providing just the right texture for these songs, giving them a dusty, black and white feel.<br /><br />This album is my favorite Springsteen album because it is that rare album that hits you harder with just a guitar, harmonica, and lyrics, than any fully produced, full band album ever could.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|This book was a quick read but never really felt like anything more than an unsatisfying clone of a later-year John Grisham novel.<br /><br />First of all a major case involving the DA's son would never be prosecuted by his employer and handled by his assistant. This obvious conflict of interest would never happen in the real world.  This legal \\"error\\" clouds my judgement of the remaining book.<br /><br />Also the book was written in the first tense.  It did not allow for proper character development of Jacob and other characters.  It would have made for a better book if you could get different points of view of the case from the other characters.  I especially had a problem with the wife, Laurie. Her character was very shallow and her motivations and actions were too unbelievable for a mom and wife.<br /><br />Near the end of the book plot twists were created just for the sake of it and new characters popped into the story just move along the narrative.  By the time the book was over I just felt relieved to be at the end.  If left no lingering mark in my mind the way good novels do.

B006OV7S1I|4.0|Martha Marcy May Marlene (2011)<br />Drama, 102 minutes<br />Directed by Sean Durkin<br />Starring Elizabeth Olsen, Sarah Paulson and John Hawkes<br /><br />I don't like to read reviews before I see a film for the first time, but my curiosity was piqued when so many critics named Martha Marcy May Marlene among their favorite films from 2011.<br /><br />For some reason, I expected the story to be about a woman with multiple personality disorder. That wasn't the case, but identity is one of the main themes.<br /><br />This is a film that will alienate a lot of potential viewers. The plot is non-linear and often transitions quickly from Martha's memories to her present reality. There's also a lot of nudity and a small amount of sex. Both are essential to the plot.<br /><br />Martha (Olsen) is in her early 20s and we see her join a cult in the first five minutes of the film. She's uncertain of her role at first, but soon begins to feel like part of the community. The cult is led by Patrick (Hawkes) and he is quietly persuasive. He gradually asserts his will over the other cult members and sleeps with the women. He thinks that Martha looks more like a Marcy May, so that becomes her name while she is a member of the cult.<br /><br />The story deals with Martha's attempt to rejoin society after she decides to escape from the cult. She makes a phone call to her older sister, Lucy (Paulson), who picks her up and invites her to stay with her and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy). The scene involving the phone call is accompanied by some disquieting music reminiscent of a David Lynch film. In fact, with Martha seemingly capable of almost anything, you won't feel comfortable at any point in the film. You're not supposed to.<br /><br />Martha has no idea of how to behave in normal society. She's used to sleeping in a room filled with other cult members and feels isolated when she's alone. Her time as a member of the cult has also affected the way she eats and drinks. She thinks nothing of swimming naked or walking in when her sister is having sex. This is perfectly acceptable behavior in her mind after her recent experiences.<br /><br />The film regularly shows a scene in the present and then cuts to a scene in the recent past to illustrate the difference between Martha's two worlds. I know plenty of friends who would be irritated by the choice to tell the story in such a manner, but I think it works. It reminds me of Memento in some ways because Martha's experiences feel more immediate if we see things from her viewpoint.<br /><br />I also found myself thinking about the lifestyles we choose. Lucy and Ted are typical of most people. They judge success in terms of money and possessions and take great pride in their house. When Martha says it's too big for two people, they explain that they like to entertain. They clearly want to be viewed as successful by their friends. That point is highlighted when they plan a party. Lucy dresses Martha in some of her clothes and fixes her hair. She tells Martha she looks beautiful. But the reason she does it is not to make Martha feel special, but to show her friends how wonderful her younger sister is.<br /><br />There's a sense of unease throughout the film because it's possible that the cult could look for Martha. She even asks at one point how far away their house is from the place Lucy picked her up. Does she fear being recaptured, or does she have some other purpose in mind and is wondering how far she will have to travel to rejoin them?<br /><br />I think that's more than enough information about the plot, except to say that the conclusion is completely open-ended. You'll have to make up your own mind about Martha's future. I haven't mentioned who Marlene is, but it's fairly obvious when you watch the film.<br /><br />The acting is particularly convincing. Hawkes does a great job of quietly asserting his authority over the group and even sings a song for Marcy May. Olsen delivers an outstanding breakthrough performance and will surely pick up some other good roles because of this film. Along with Ellen Page, she'll be a popular choice when a movie requires a character in her early 20s.<br /><br />I found myself thinking about the film the day after I saw it and that's usually a good sign. I think it's one of those stories which will assume greater significance on repeat viewings and I'm interested to see where Sean Durkin takes us with his next project.through performance and will surely pick up some other good roles because of this film.

B0067Q42BY|4.0|Decent mahjong game, can go fast, but sometimes fat fingers get in the way.  I got it as the app of the day, so for the price it is great.  It would be worth paying a few bucks for.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|neeed more points!!!!! fun but maybe too hard to unlock new games without buying them.... overall fun game though. I like it
1612130283|1.0|I had high hopes for this book, I really did. I started with an open mind, but by the time I was done I thought my IQ had dropped several points. The writing was terrible and the story was not as engaging as I had hoped. Nothing truly shocked me and I didn't care about the characters all that much, except to say that I found Anastasia very annoying. Also, I felt the scenes where the author was attempting humor came off as forced and I found myself embarrassed not by the steamy sex scenes but by the fact I was actually reading such drivel. I also feel the story was dragged out just so the author could make this a trilogy. I was a little intrigued as to what made Christian the way he was but not so much that I care to suffer through another book to find out. I just don't care about these characters enough. All in all, it was ok but surely a disappointment as the book is so overrated.
B0063IH60K|5.0|hours of fun for everyone . good for all ages. I am glad I found this game. I use it a lot.
140120841X|4.0|As someone who spends a lot of his free time reading, writing, and drawing comics, I say that this definitely one of the best graphic navels today.  I find that the idea of a graphic navel is to tell a story that captivates the reader by providing imagery and dialog to better express the complexities in the story line. The hard part is doing that and having the story line run smooth. Often times a writer will use simple minded dialog to help the reader understand what has just happened and in doing so compromises the quality of the dialog. In V for Vendetta however, the story moves through the pages of the book with artistic depictions and through you're imagination with well written dialog. Not everyone is fan of graphic novels but anyone who enjoys reading will find that the imagination has a lot of fun any time the cover has the name Alan Moore upon it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy solitaire and this one is great.  I have it on my kindle fire. I do not experience. any of the pop ups or ads others have.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of my favorites. The ads don't interfere with game play but if you don't like them then upgrade to the payed ap.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After reading this book, it compares with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" in terms of a mind blowing and futuristic world. I highly recommend it to anyone with a desire to travel to a different civilization; you won't be sorry!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app does every thing it is suppose to do. Create, open and save file right on your device. Thanks.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Both my son (8-years old) & my husband are totally addicted to this game.  Great fun that I would recommend to all!  Just be prepared to have your kid keep stealing your phone!
B003JRD5JO|5.0|Just wanna say what a great group Bon Jovi is.All of the songs on this cd are excellent hits ay back then and just as good today too.

B001HADE00|5.0|I couldnt beleive it when i came across Ratt on amazon.It had been a long lost group that i used to listen to as a teenager and there it was.Great Cd
B00457WZEI|4.0|War Horse<br />From Amazon.com<br /><br />I heard the movie was worth going to see. I like to read the book first, if available. The book was really very differnt than any book I've read. It was told from the horses perspective. I was on a long car ride so, I got my reader out and read.<br />I had to laugh out loud a couple times, at myself for reading about a horse from a horse. It takes place during WW1 when horses were used on front lines by officers on both sides of the war. They were also used to pull wagons to pick up wounded soldiers. A lot of horses died and were badly mistreated. But they had some good people in the story also. I finished it and talked about it with my daughter inlaw. She was a little skepticle, and gave me the mother in-law look. But really the book was very good, and I would recomend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I luv this game you wont usually find a game with 101 games but every game has its ups and downs this game has really poor controls it makes some of the games impossible but over all everything is really good
B001M3WPY8|5.0|I was amazed how beautiful it was.  I bought it for my husband that is a old comic book fan.  The colors are very bright.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|the game runs great on my nexus s but constantly freezes on my Asus transformer prime. wish there was a HD version for tablets.
B0013TPV0Q|3.0|I have been a loyal listener of NPR for over twenty years, yet I do not recall having heard any of this author's work.  Friends have recommended him to me, so I've purchased this book for my Kindle and am about half way through.  I'm torn between such sadness for this man's life experience and being mildly entertained.  I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt as I get to know him through the essays.  I probably should have started with an earlier book.
B001GY0FHM|4.0|The special effects that were used in this movie were cutting edge at that time... And are still pretty amazing even by today's standards.  It's a very cool story line and kept me entertained throughout the entire film.  This should be watched by anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi genre!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I saw the documentary \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" at the Sundance Film Festival and was amazed by the Sixto Rodriguez story.  Having worked in Detroit in the mid 60's I felt even more connected.  I downloaded his two CD's as soon as I got home and find myself istening to them often and some of his songs, like \\"I Wonder\\" ringing through my head regularly.  His music has rhythm, interesting melodies and intelligent lyrics with relavence today as 40 years ago.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|surperb graphics.  excellent logical puzzles.  this game is a must for anyone who loves adventure games.  it is even better than their first game--the secret of grisly manor.  great job fire maple games!!!  when does your next adventure game come out?  can't wait!!
B002NWRMVS|2.0|Nora Jones is a very busy performer and shows up in all kinds of places. She can sing anything from jazz, country & western, pop, comedy, even folk. I've been a big fan since her initial effort and have bought several of her CDs. I eagerly awaited this one, but from the first heavy, thudding note, I knew The Fall would be disappointing. Nora's voice and style are appealing as ever, but I don't like the song choices, and I especially don't care for the musical arrangements. Others may enjoy the heavy synthesizer, and welcome to it. A couple of the songs don't have the synthesizer, but they seem to lack something. Also, I miss her piano playing, which I identify with her voice as much as anything. The huge dog on the cover suggests the heaviness of the musical arrangements. The only tune I somewhat enjoy is the last one called \\"Man of the Hour,\\" a comic song about the reliability of pets as opposed to, say, boyfriends. Every artist needs to grow and try new things, so this is not so much a criticism as an expression of personal taste. I recall Gillian Welch, another favorite, bringing out a CD with loud, obtrusive drums in every cut. I could ignore them to some extent because the songs were fine, but I think both CDs show the pitfalls involved in choosing a producer or album concept, which can make or break a CD. This one is not so much a fall as a stumble.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Like others have said, this game is addicting! I like all the different appliances. Add me: mynameisgirl<br />I also play bakery story and fashion storyk
B007G5FX4K|1.0|UGH...this song is putrid!  Her vocal tracks are virtually non-existent, and when you do hear her voice, she sounds like a chipmunk that inhaled helium.  As a lifelong Madonna fan, now former, Hard Candy is the last album I will buy, and after hearing this track along with the other \\"Luvin\\" garbage, I know I made the right decision.  How in the world is this woman going to come up with 2 more albums after MDNA that don't all sound the same?!  She can't.  Too bad the old Madonna is gone for good.  Those who say this reminds them of classics like Deeper and Deeper are on crack.  How can you possibly compare the two?  So sad that this woman is done for.  This is no dance classic!  How can you dance to such a hyper, non-existent vocal nightmare, once again laden with computer noise and fake vocoders.  Sounds just like Lady GaGa's noise she puts out now.  I highly doubt MDNA will sell that many albums.  All of you people are being played.  She really only cares about the tours she has to come up with, and the albums are clearly an after thought now.  I remember reading an article about a year ago, and in it, Madonna was saying \\"I think I have a fan club\\" totally dissing loyal Icon members and not really saying anything about making any real music, but rather focusing on the tours.  No more quality from this woman.  Ok, if you like electronic noise, then you will like this track.  Those looking for real music should look elsewhere.  Too bad she couldn't have just ended her career on a high note, but rather had to degrade her sound that made her famous.  RIP Madonna.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|This one is a little more challenging than most and all the more intriguing. Requires critical thinking and a some counting.
B004LWZW7O|2.0|I, like most had seen the trailer for this in theaters and put this on my \\"must see\\" list!  I did not make it to see this in the theaters and I am kind of glad that I did not.<br /><br />This film had a good concept which of course is based on current events like the 1% vs. the 99% - the very greedy haves vs. the have-nots/can't let them get!  This film is clearly and overt political film which should have been more covert in order to truly get it's point across.  This film touches on the mega rich vs. the poor and how the mega rich not only keep the poor down and away from them, but they also make sure that they can never achieve anything in life - unless allowed by the mega rich!  It is art imitating life - albeit financed by the 1%!<br />The idea of the film is that time is used as currency to determine how long you are to live.  The more that you make, the longer you live.  The more you make, the more things that you can do.  Of course in real life, the more that you make the more that you can do and the longer you CAN live due to better health care and other factors.  There is no paper money or anything called money it is just time that you deal with.  Of course the mega rich horde all of the time for themselves and they could care less who has any.<br /><br />The film takes place in a place called Dayton - although we can clearly see the Los Angeles skyline in the background!  That is the ghetto, and there is the wealthy suburb of \\"New Greenwich\\" which I assume is supposed to be a place like Greenwich, CT where the mega rich live and they do what they can to keep \\"others\\" out of the town and they know instantly if you do not `belong' there!<br /><br />The scope of the film was large, but the execution was small.  I do not know if this is due to the budget, the producer's vision of the limited L.A. scenery, but the film does not LOOK good!  It takes place 150 years from now, but it looks like it takes place 50 years ago!  150 years from now and they ride in cars from the 80's, 60's and 70's?  I guess that is a part of the budget.  I also hate it when films that take place in the future always have the same look with the long coat cops and plain vehicles.<br /><br />I know that parts of this future are based on what many say people are planning which includes biochips (available), population reduction (so that the rich will have less challengers), economic collapse (to make people rebel so that they can be killed), increasing the cost of living while keeping pay the same and a police state!  I hope those are not the plans because that would be a foolish thing to do for the US.  This film touches on it but the setting, look and \\"futuristic\\" design do not translate well in 2011/2012 given that things look a lot better now.  They should have spent more or chosen a different city to film in and it should have been done iRobot style.<br /><br />The BD picture quality is of course A1 since this is a new release and they are not really going to look bad most times.  This is something to see, but not anything to buy.  Timberlake's acting is not too bad if you keep in mind that he was a signer first.  His first few acting roles, his timing was off, now that he has that together he may have a future in acting.

B00009P1O2|5.0|I do not consider myself a Queen fan as I only have the Classic Queen CD from the 90s.<br /><br />After watching one of those Queen tribute acts in my local theatre, I thought that Queen could be a great live act.<br /><br />It helped that this European edition consisting of 2 DVDs and 2 CDs are sold at a very attractive price.<br /><br />Watch it on your big screen TV, Queen literally leaps out at you! It's amazing how the sound and picture quality of this 1986 concert are so well preserved and restored!<br /><br />The performances are raw and loud and Freddie is at his most flamboyant. He is just so theatrical that I am compelled to check out their back catalogue.<br /><br />If you are looking at a model set list, then Queen Live At Wembley Stadium 25th Anniversary Edition should satisfy. Radio staples such as I Want To Break Free and Radio Ga Ga are here but not on the Queen Rock Montreal video.<br /><br />The chief attraction is the never before released full Friday night concert on 11 July 1986. You also get the Saturday show plus its audio counterpart on 2 CDs and some rehearsal footage.<br /><br />If you are curious about Queen, you'll not regret this! A terrific buy!
0393061310|5.0|A short summary: central Asian peoples (Eurasians) have come to dominate modern history because they had many more useful domestic animals and a wider range of nourishing crops available, and better geography to migrate and dominate.  The superior animals could get more useful work done, move larger armies for conquest, and evolve worse animal-human shared diseases & immunities that did bad things to other populations. The better crops allowed a robust humanity, a denser population in areas, and more free time to invent things. The east-to-west same-latitude freedom of movement enabled relatively easy movement of people and armies. In short: more inventions, deadlier diseases, better weapons. Guns, germs and steel. The subsequent shortage of analysis makes one think that the author doesn't much like the Eurasian descendants -- western man.<br /><br />Luck, for the author, becomes the biggest factor in group population successes, it seems. Readers may remember the phrase, \\"geographical determinism\\" from school. Jared Diamond does allow that different populations having access to same technologies often do not acquire and use them at the same rate (see p. 252 about such a difference in close-bordering New Guinea tribes). Also, food production today in North America is overwhelmingly more productive than in pre-Columbian days. The author attributes this solely to the previous absence of the right kind of domesticated animals and plants. No negatives about the possible lack of native wishes to make improvements.<br /><br />Still, this book is absorbing, and the reader will like the author's style and his enormous amount of research, interestingly told. \\"Yali's Question\\" starts the book, a nice approach. The question came from a New Guinean (Yali) who had asked and wondered why the \\"white people\\" have brought much \\"cargo\\" (good goods) to New Guinea, but New Guineans didn't bring cargo to the rest of the world. Mr. Yali's question obviously expressed the worry that his people bore a deep inferiority to the recent light-skinned peoples who had landed on their large island. Perhaps someone smarter than this reviewer will read the last chapter and discern if Diamond's conclusion actually answers Yali's Question directly.

0545265355|5.0|I LOVE HUNGER GAMES!!!!!! IT'S LIKE THE BEST SERIES EVERY (FOR NOW). IT'S AMAZING AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HOW THEY PROTRAY IT ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. Katniss Everdeen is a sixteen year-old girl living in District 12 in Panem. She's best friends with Gale Hawthorne. Katniss has a younger sister named Primrose \\"Prim\\" Everdeen, and then there's also their mother. Peeta Mellark is the son of a nice baker man and a mean witch-like women. He has two brothers. The Hunger Games is the Capitals way of reminding Panem that they have complete control over everything and that it would  futile to rebel again, as they did almost 75 years ago in the book. The first book is about Katniss trying to survive in the Hunger Games and deal with the Capital and Peeta. The second book is about after the Hunger Games and their tour around Panem to all the Districts. In the end of the second book is kind of like a introduction to the third book. in the third book is when the rebellion is going on and Katniss is trying to find out her feelings for both Gale and Peeta. Overall the series is amazing. Some people are killed who you never expected to die. BEST STORY EVER!!!!

B003O86FMW|1.0|I purchased this book on my kindle and was so excited to read it as I had just finished books one and two of the series. But after I paid and it was sent to my Kindle, I went to read and found only the title pages of each part of the book and the epilogue. Nothing else! Fortunately my husband had borrowed our neighbor's hard copy and I was able to read! The book itself was great, but I was very disappointed and would like either my money back or to have a whole copy of this book sent to my kindle!
030746363X|5.0|I'm not saying this book changed my life, but for positivity and a totally different yet do-able mindset this book and this Tim character are second to none. There is a genuine and well meaning community influenced by this book and the methods/mindset found in it, which is in itself a testament to the books qualities.
B005KELW26|3.0|This is a beautiful cover, in terms of looks.  I was hoping to find a cover as sturdy as the M-Edge cover I have, for my first Kindle - which has a rather hard front cover - which offers more protection to the Kindle screen.<br /><br />The front  cover on this one, while not flappy and soft, is not as hard as the M-Edge I have for my first kindle.<br /><br />I hope M-Edge comes out with a cover for the Fire.
B004UJAOLM|1.0|Seriously hated every page of this book.  Not that it matters, but I read a lot of classic literature, and this is by far the worst book I have ever read.  The characters were mean, vile and had no redeeming qualities.  It must have read like absolute trash in the time period it was written, and still does today.  I fail to see how anybody could find this story romantic. If a man told me that this book epitomizes his idea of romance, I would run for the hills and never look back. I honestly can't waste any more time on this book, even to write a lengthier review.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Amazon's photo of this item shows TWO fans! And the other pics only show one fan.<br /><br />The regular 212 only comes with one fan! BUT the PLUS apparently comes with TWO fans. WHICH, you can buy the PLUS w/2 fans for only $25! Where as the regular 212 is selling for $32 (right now).<br /><br />The 212 is rated as the best air cooler for your CPU, and best bang for your buck by most techs and geeks. The only cooler that beats the 212, compared to the REGULAR 212, is twice the money $60.<br /><br />I have the regular 212 and WISH the PLUS was available when I bought mine, especially since it is EVEN CHEAPER.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is so wonderful that I would say taht it is almost worth buying a tablet just to have this app.
B002U3CB5M|4.0|The book captures you from start to end. Not easy to close (for instance to go to sleep, etc)the book and continue later. It was worth buying the book.
B001ECDVKE|3.0|Given the high-powered cast, a healthy budget and top-notch director,this should have been the sci-fi send-up to end all send-ups. Alas, the film becomes mired in its own self-conscious approach. Nonetheless, there are some very funny moments, and Nicholson (in the character of the casino 'mogul'), Pierce Brosnan as the smug science advisor to the President (also played by Nicholson) and Martin Short as the president's press secretary contribute a lot towards the inanity and goin's on in the film. Sarah Jessica Parker's role as the dull-witted TV personality also shines. If you're looking for a chuckle or two then you'll probably like this okay comedy.

B006OCM0G0|1.0|You might be thinking its a free app, I wont be losing any money if I buy it. The truth is you will. When you try to buy something and you don't have enough money for it a screen pops up and you might be thinking its just another one of those &quot;please try again&quot;, but its not. The screen says &quot;you don't have enough money to buy this item. press okay to buy more coins.&quot; Most of the time you don't read this type of messages and assume it says something else and just press ok. that's a big mistake because if your son is playing it, less would he care about what it says and just press ok, but it will be you who pays the price of the $100 credit card bill to teamlava.

B004J2TPSI|5.0|I was skeptical about buying this item, because of some of the reviews on the Internet. I figured I could buy it from amazon and send it back if I had any problems.  I received it quickly and was not happy when I tried pairing it to two different bluetooth ear pieces and Had no luck. I emailed the company and got a quick response. You must hook up to a stereo device. I bought a Motorola headset and it paired perfect. At home I have about a 30 ft range, but at work my range doubles. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to go bluetooth, especially with a kindle! (I got my headset @ best buy)

0142419400|5.0|To be honest, I almost did not buy this book.  I read through the sample and was only vaguely interested.  There were only a few factors that made me consider it.  I was really hoping for more of a connection in that sample, but I decided to risk it and see what happens.  WOW.  Completely worth it.  Where has this book been all my life?<br /><br />Here is what I believe potential readers should be aware of if they are considering this book:<br /><br />-There aren't any cookie-cutter main characters.  This, for me, is one of the main reasons I loved this book so much.  The two main characters are not poster children for GAP or a tv show from the 50s, where all the problems are solved quickly.  Etienne is short (shorter than Anna, I believe), Anna has a gap between her two front teeth that she says a raisin can fit through, and they both have separate, yet similar family issues.  I could go on and on, but I don't want to give away too much.<br /><br />-Situations are not easy.  Anna and Etienne's relationship starts out complicated and only gets worse before it gets better.  It's clear that both are interested in each other, but there are big complications.  When you first meet the characters, Anna is pining for a guy in the States, and Etienne is in a serious relationship with another girl.  Even though there is a growing attraction, they both still try to do the right thing, which makes it complicated.<br /><br />-Nothing is instantaneous.  Everything grows over a long period of time, allowing the reader to become completely immersed.  You get to work with them through all the problems and are rooting for them by the end.  This can get frustrating for some if they are looking for instant gratification.  I even became a little frustrated that they wouldn't take a leap when I wanted them to, but when they finally did, it was magical.<br /><br />So, if you are thinking about reading this book, I would reconsider if you want the smoking hot characters with typical or no character flaws or if you are looking for instant gratification.  This book is NOT for you.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to wait and watch Anna and Etienne work through all the complications, Stephanie Perkins makes it completely worth it.character flaws or if you are looking for instant gratification.  This book is NOT for you.<br /><br />However, if you are willing to wait and watch Anna and Etienne work through all the complications, Stephanie Perkins makes it completely worth it.
0802130208|5.0|One of my favorite books.  Subversively funny.  Crude, indignant, and dead on. A must read if your are a lover of satire or New Orleans!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book was excellently written with numerous references and real data cited throughout. The presentation was straightforward yet insightful with the data backing up the author's claims. I feel enriched to have read this book. As a programmer recognizing the concepts within, the authors turned what could have been a projected dreaded future into an optimistic one. The data presented give me confidence in the position of the authors and their views of our future encourage the inventor in me. This is a great read for anyone involved with technology from software developer to robot builders.
0375869026|5.0|This is seriously one of my top ten favorite books EVER. I don't care that the book is written for middle schoolers and the main character is ten. It's simply one of the finest works of fiction I have ever read.<br /><br />August (\\"Auggie\\") was born with a severe facial deformity that gives him a strange and almost horrifying appearance. But he is surrounded by such a strong and loving family, and he grows up to be an intelligent, amazing, and extremely likable person. He shows that you cannot always judge a book by its cover. Because Auggie is a shiningly beautiful person inside. He accepts his fate and lives with it. He knows when people see him on the street and point and start talking about him. It's normal. Because he knows that he would probably do the same if his situation were reversed.<br /><br />When Auggie's mom convinces him that it's time to join other kids in a private school (rather than continuing to be home-schooled), he is initially frightened and wants nothing to do with it. But he decides to give it a try, and events occur that will change his life forever. He learns that sometimes both adults and kids can be cruel, but there are also a lot of good people in this world, too.<br /><br />I cried happy and sad tears throughout this book, but my happiest tears were for the ending. If everyone could just have an Auggie in their lives, I think we would be better people. This book will stay with me for a long time, in a GOOD way.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games. I find them all pretty amusing so far, some are more challenging than others. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the response is s little slow but this may not be the game's fault. It may be my device. Stills great way to pass the time.
B004I744AS|5.0|Very easy to use.  It brings up a series of words and helps guide one to the word and it's definition and the ability to move to the thesaurus or Wikipedia.
B00785P2QC|3.0|takes a long time to earn coins to buy things unless you use real money to get more coins. but lots of options
B002WY65VU|5.0|This movie is funny and gory at the same time. It has a couple of sad parts in it but it is a great movie to see if you like zombie movies.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|love this game!!!! its very addicting. its fun to decorate your restaurant.  runs very smooth on my kindle fire. add me, my ID is alyssamills

B004QK5N5W|5.0|Works perfectly. Just be sure your set has HDMI input. Getting your iPad to play sound through your home entertainment unit might be harder, depending on your setup.
B004AKCME8|5.0|This was received in good condition and played with no scratches. I love this movie. Its awesome. It showed the colors bright and in detail. Beautiful movie. I wish they made a sequel to this movie. No regrets/problems.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I don't write reviews but felt the need on this one. I also don't watch gory movies - what's the point? We got this on a whim and it is actually REALLY funny and the gore is minimal which is awesome. So if you are a gore wimp like me you will like it. I was completely surpised by this one and enjoyed it. If you are looking for something insanely funny and off the wall - this is the movie!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very enjoyable game so far. I have abandoned bejeweled fitter the time being as this has a bit more Braun trading power.
B0029O08WA|5.0|This CD was not love at first listen.  I am a huge fan of the Twilight saga books and movies and purchased the Twilight soundtrack from Amazon a while back without hesitation.  But the songs on New Moon didn't sink their teeth into me from the first listen during the movie and so I hedged before buying and borrowed a copy from my local library first on the strength of the one song that did really grab me and that was \\"Monsters\\" by Hurricane Bells.  But slowly and surely this soundtrack on repeat playings etched its way into my psyche and by then I just had to have a copy of my own.  The songs take me to scenes in the movie and whilst Monsters is probably still my favourite (most likely because it evokes memories of the film in which Edward strides across the carpark to Bella, sigh...), the rest are now close behind.  My least favourite song would have to be \\"Done All Wrong\\" but it's pretty challenging to find a cd where you absolutely love every song.  This disc is now one of my favourites and gets played often.  It has continued to open my eyes and ears to music that I hadn't been aware of before the Twilight phenomenon gripped me.  I have long been a big fan of soundtracks and this one I can highly recommend....even if you don't love it at first spin.  Don't be surprised when it finds it's way under your skin too.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|First off, go and read this book, whether you like vampires, witches or supernatural fiction or not. It easily stands on its own merits.<br /><br />It is very beautifully written in a fresh and distinctive voice. Rather than the author's voice getting in the way, Ms. Hamilton's style draws you into the story and the setting, so you really feel that you are on the same journey as Sophia, right by her side. This is a very talented writer.<br /><br />The characters are well thought out, believable and invoked real emotions in me, whether I loved or hated them. Even Sophia and her friends had flaws, emotional needs and didn't always do or say the right thing, but this made me care about them right up to the last page. The dialog was strong and realistic, and true to each character. The author really got into the head of each one, it shows.<br /><br />The story unfolds with good pacing and suspense, as Sophia (and we) become slowly immersed in the supernatural world going on right under everyone's noses, and Sophia's own powers mature. And it's a rich and fantastic world of ancient feuding creatures. Wonderfully realized.<br /><br />The last 100 pages had me on the edge of my seat! A thrilling battle in a gorgeously described location that oozed necrotic power and death. Very appropriate as deaths come fast and brutal. I genuinely had no idea if her friends would make it or not. Good - I hate predictable plots.<br /><br />Great read.
B004G5VFOU|5.0|The first two songs on this album/CD are what I purchased it for. \\"Glad\\" and \\"Freedom Rider\\" are a couple of great pieces regardless of the group or period, IMO - the things that give the entire CD 5 stars. The other cuts are good to very good, but not ones that I put onto my MP3 player for playing in my car; the first two songs can be great \\"driving\\" music.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Every dad must watch this powerful film.  We take so mucyh for granted as parents and this movie motivates me to the right kind of Christian Dad to my girls!
B0063FGG22|4.0|Made 3 years before James Bond made spy movies extremely popular, North by Northwest sometimes comes across as a bit of a caper instead of something more serious, but it has enough going on to keep you interested, even over 136 minutes, a running time few Bond films have exceeded.<br /><br />Cary Grant is Roger Thornhill, an NY adman who lives a fast and loose lifestyle. When he's mistaken for an enigmatic spy called George Kaplan his is hurled into a partially confusing plot involving cold war traitors, secret agents and double agents. Thornhill travels up and down and across the country trying to outwit his pursuers and find out what the hell is going on, all while romancing Eva Marie Saint, with Bernard Herrmann boisterous score propelling him along.<br /><br />It's another one of Hitchcock's 'wrong man' thrillers, and probably the best (however, I do rate Saboteur highly). But it IS still a bit overrated. It's shot very well, in many different locations, and there's little, if anything, to dislike about it. But like many early Bond movies there are many scenes where you can easily tell that the characters are just walking on a treadmill with a rear-projection behind them instead of physically being in actual locations. It doesn't spoil anything, though it is always noticeable.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks absolutely stunning in 1.78:1 1080p, with hardly a scratch or a speck of dust to mar the presentation. Warner did an amazing job restoring this film, which looks just as good, if not better, than many modern films on the format. The sound Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and there are numerous extras. Definitely worth getting.
B0059XTTXC|5.0|in the very beginning of the film you see someone sitting next the John Hurt, and you say Awesome Bill Nighy is in this to. then you realize its Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman). Past that point its totally good. very clever, mystery film. the kind you don't see get made nowadays.

B005R4255C|3.0|I was hoping the sound quality would be as good as The Beatles Love album.  This is a real miss.  The content is GREAT, but the sound quality lacked dynamics.  It's very compressed.  I still think you should buy it for it's contents, but it's not audiophile grade CD like the Love album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun! lots of games to keep you entertained for hours. all ages will enjoy all these games. played for several hours and never got board.
0141301120|5.0|The book is in great condition, priced right, and arrived promptly in the mail.<br /><br />Oh, this worked out so nicely. My nephew was asking the grown-ups for this book and through the relative telephone line, I was able to search on Amazon and find it and for his birthday, he had it in his hands! A great feeling all around. He thinks I am a great Aunt and he is a Happy nephew!

Got it downloaded, fixed and I use it all the time. I am a attorney and need a calculator all the time. Actually feel it helped me win a case cuz it was so fast, I answered the judge's question immediately and the other attorney was still standing there with his mouth open, \\"ah daa, daa . . .\\" the judge gave me $6,000 in fees cuz I was so quick.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I havent been in the best shape the past two years and put on 20 pounds and decided to give this a try from all the awesome reviews. (as well as other jillian workouts!) I popped it in and man who knew 20 minutes would be so challenging! It is a good challenge, I like how she talks you through everything and shows you how not to do things, and keeps me motivated to keep pushing through the end. My body is SO sore!! it is such a great feeling. She is exactly what I needed to get me motivated to workout (other than the scale...lol). The only thing I have to say that is somewhat bad about it is that I need WAY more time to stretch at the end. lol i woke up today so sore and i wish i stretched more at the end of the workout. other than that i love it!!! go on and buy it you wont be disappointed!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love to play solitaire.  Found this to be easy to navigate. It's an easy game to play when waiting for your pizza order to be ready.
B0052U59F4|1.0|Do your self a favor, \\"Look Inside\\" and read the first page before paying any good money for this.  The writing is 4th grade level at best, and after the first page, I elected not to pay for a poorly written book ... no matter how tantalizing the subject might be.  Besides the fact she gets her basic info wrong:  You do not head toward Portland from Vancouver, WA if you are going to Seattle. And it is either \\"I-5\\" or \\"the 5\\", not \\"the I-5\\".  Grateful for \\"Look Inside\\".

B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is so fun. It is imposiable for me not to like this game. You will not regret getting this game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For a free app, not too bad. I do wish the controls were a little tighter, as others have said. And I wish the bonuses got bigger for completing games as the 'cost' for games got higher. But other than that very entertaining!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it is so fun and passes time if your waiting in line or something like that

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I recently finished this book. It was one of the best books ive ever read! The auther does a fantastic  job of keeping the readers attention throughout the entire book. I look forward to reading more from Jay Asher.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|Ok, I have loved Accept for decades and have bought every single thing they have ever done even Eat the Heat with David Reece on vocals. As good as the music was it just didn't cut it without UDO. Having said that when I head of this CD with another new singer I was like o well who cares. BUT I WAS WRONG THIS CD IS THE BEST THING SINCE BALLS TO THE WALL. Mark is perfect for Accept and dare I say better than UDO for accept. This isn't just great Heavy Metal this is simply Accept doing it better than ever!!!
B0073PZIYI|1.0|The subject was interesting, but it was not played out well.  The movie was rushed, the acting shotty, and many things did not make sense.
0375704027|4.0|If your looking for the unconventional weirdness of the Wind up Bird Chronicle et al, this isn't the place to turn. Norwegian Wood is surprisingly straightforward. It works well because Murakami really gets the texture of college life, the boredom, the weird way you sort of slip into other people's confidences and intimacies and out of them again as quickly, the strange, unbalanced people everyone seems to end up meeting and getting involved with. It's a very wistfully gentle sort of book.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|this app was doing good happy as ever ontill I went to farm story I came back and the screen was green I could still do things but I wasn't able to see anything but a green screen
B003O86FMW|4.0|The writing style will appeal to teens and 'tweens and, for the most part, their parents.  The language is not offensive, but the story does involve death.  The discriptions are handled in a way to heighten the plot suspense, but not in a way to scare most young people.  At the same time adults will like the way the story proceeds to involve the reader and keep interest very high!  This book is a real \\"page turner!\\"
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I'm not exactly certain how many of us are reading these stories for the first time. Holmes & Watson form a most engaging pair as they set about solving mysteries. As always, these are mostly riveting.<br /><br />However, since I read Holmes' & Watson's adventures back in school, certain things can definitely be seen in a new light. And this bit is not the bit about unraveling mysteries - this is the bit about learning about Holmes as a character, learning about London, in particular, & all the nuances that went into making the English, at the time. Either because you'd remember something from your earlier reads, or because the tricks of a detective novel aren't exactly novel anymore, the mysteries themselves aren't quite as puzzling & the factor of awe is, at least for me, diluted.<br /><br />Learning of these nuances of character - for example, between a Poirot & a Holmes - was for me the essence of this re-read. While Poirot's eccentricities made him, say, ridiculous, our man Holmes is downright nasty & as stiff & pompous an ass as you're likely to encounter. Fascinating too are the characters in the story & what their behavior has to say about English values, at the time - for instance, the relationship between a parent & a child is clearly not egalitarian, not even when the children are of a fairly advanced age. The hierarchical British society manifests itself time & again, & pound sterling, more valuable then, could buy you so much more.<br /><br />So yes, the mysteries are an enjoyable but it is what you learn of the context that in my mind makes this read invaluable & definitely worth many re-reads.<br /><br />@souvikstweets
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The first book of the series and a good one!  This book can stand alone, but at the same time it makes you want to read the rest of the series.  The universal appeal to the young reader as well as adults will make this book a popular item for many households.  Parents will like the language in that there is little to criticize.  There is no sex and little violence for a book with such wide interest and suspense filled plot.<br />I think everyone will enjoy this book and the ones to follow.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app it make solitaire nice, easy, enjoyable and fun to play. I recommend this to all that are wanting to play solitaire.

B004EPYZZ8|3.0|I didn't care for this film, though AnnaSophia Robb did an excellent job, as always.  Bethany is a courageous young girl. Also, the water photography was awesome.<br /><br />The \\"message,\\" however, didn't do much for me. First off, while I am not minimizing the impact of losing an arm, and the reality that everyday activities, once easy and taken for granted, becoming different and difficult, it is not a \\"tragedy.\\" Losing one's life is a tragedy. Suffering with painful illness or incapacitation is a tragedy. Children with no home or love are living a tragedy. I could understand Bethany's love of surfing being her whole world, and her lack of perspective, she was a child. What was her parents' excuse? They seemed to feel also that surfing was the most important thing for her, more important than church, way more important than school, and more important than doing anything to help anyone else. Bethany blew off a trip to help needy children in Mexico because she had to train, and her parents allowed this. Instead, all that was important to all of them was for her to be the best and to win endorsements.<br /><br />I saw after the film that Bethany did go on to be a pro surfer, continuing to focus on being the best and winning endorsements. The idea of \\"surfing for Jesus\\" leaves me cold. I would think that a film that feels it important to model good Christian values would focus less on Bethany's hobby and more on her trying to serve God, thinking about and helping other people rather than focusing on doing only what she enjoys, which doesn't serve or help anyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app but some of the games very difficult to beat. I think you should change the sensitive of some of the games they a little touchy.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Have not read a Stephen King novel in a long time but liked the idea of this one and just loved it! If you like 'what if' scenarios and have any interest in American history you will love this book.
0062082353|4.0|Kyle's book recounts his time in the Navy's elite SEALs and how he wound up there. Unlike many war books American Sniper makes the fight easily understandable, easily imaginable... but of course part of this is the fact that Kyle experienced war at the lowest possible level, often one-on-one.<br /><br />The book looks at Kyle's early life, growing up in Texas, and then entering the Navy in hope of joining the SEALs. SEALs are very effective commandos and their training aims at getting the very best, men who will not quit and who can fight effectively in on the land, in the sea and in the air. The training is tough, even brutal, but then again so is war. What surprised me was the fact that brutality doesn't necessarily end with the school.<br /><br />Before entering his first battle Kyle is married and his wife's observations and thoughts are worked into the narrative. If you don't realize how hard it is for a spouse to deal with deployment then you will have some idea by the time this book is finished.<br /><br />Once at war Kyle finds his preconceived notions of battle off the mark. He comes to call the insurgents \\"savages\\" (and indeed, my own time in Iraq finds this term to be right on the mark) and he eventually becomes a sniper. He gains a reputation as an excellent shot, although as he freely admits part of his high score in Iraq was due to luck.<br /><br />The book for me was a little slow at the start but by the time I got halfway through it I didn't want to put it down. The language may be earthy in places and there might be observations which make those who toe the official line uncomfortable but the book is honest and patriotic. Illustrated with photos.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got this as a free ap. I love it. The graphics are really good and it provides hours of entertainment. I have been playing it in storyline mode and think the comic book stylestory is pretty neat. The ads that some have mentioned? Minimal. Haven't played this on my HTC Resound, but it works great on the Kindle Fire. This is seriously one of the best Mahjong games I've come across.
B004EPZ08E|1.0|Great cast, awful film.  What a stinker.  We hung in for about 20 minutes, and finally threw in the towel. Glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater.  Obviously it always comes down to personal preference, but how could ANYONE find this amusing????<br />It's unoriginal, relentlessly rude, and most importantly, NO ONE in the movie is remotely likeable.  And I still don't get Jennifer Aniston.  She is not much of an actress, and she's pretty much the same in everything she does.  Finally, I have a problem<br />with movies that take every opportunity to hurl a disgusting p[hrase or epithet at the audience as a substitute for genuine wit.  Richard Pryor was as profane as all get-out, but he was FUNNY.  Excessive references to sex organs and sex acts bear no<br />result except numbness.  Truly a waste of time, talent and money.
B004RE29PO|1.0|recieved item damaged. tried playing on 3 different blu-ray and still the pictures/movie would then continue.<br />this was on the whole disc
1589269063|5.0|Had purchased the book years ago to read and never got around to reading it, too busy.  The book on CD was perfect in the car to and from work and I was able to finally finish the book.  Great insights into how to be a better spouse.  Gary Chapman is a great author - love his work.  He uses a lot of examples from working with couples over the years, it really helps you to understand what he is explaining.  Really opened up my understanding.  Great read.
B005HEPWTS|4.0|This one's a classic. I have a few quibbles with the story/plot but nothing that seriously detracts from my enjoyment of it.<br /><br />My main regret is that I believe this is the last we see of the Children of Tama (at least on screen). After all, the whole point of the mission was the establish diplomatic relations with the Tamarians and they're definitely a memorable, interesting race, with at least one powerful, cool-looking ship. Though the ship model is used to represent other races' ships in DS9, the Tamarians themselves should have had at least a couple cameos during that show's run.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|I do not know what to say about all these recent 1 star reviews. Must be people who thought that Nicki Minaj was really the best new artist of the last year. Really Bon Iver didn't belong in that category, seeing as For Emma was released in 2008. However, they definitely deserved to win and get this album some further recognition. Bon Iver's second release takes a different approach than the debut, adding a full band to back the instrumentation and vocals of Justin Vernon. Beginning with the climactic Perth, and ending with the beautiful slow jam Beth/Rest, this album is really something special. You have to really listen and appreciate this music to enjoy it, but it is well worth your time. A+

B0070Z97LG|5.0|This is a great film! It has some wonderful twists in it. So - I encourage you to bypass the reviews and just watch the film. It dragged a little near the end, but it was quite suspenseful without gore, blood and senseless violence.
B001993Y0Y|5.0|Ridley Scott is amazing director that can make historic events so vivid and dramatic.<br /><br />This movie describes the life of Columbus, showing his struggle and victories. The movie has deep emotions and strong character development.<br /><br />Music, composed by Vangelis, is also top quality. The music is so good because it creates appropriate atmosphere for each part of the movie. In one instance you hear music that makes you feel triumph (when Columbus finally manages to sail with ships across the ocean). Another time you feel the tensions between native people and Columbus ship crew.<br /><br />This is a great adventure and at the same time big inspiration for everyone.

B003VDZWAQ|5.0|I almost passed it by but the music got my attention. I wanted to see if the haunting theme carried over to the program. I was not disappointed.  I think the chemistry between the characters was very well done. I liked the mixture of mystery and humor. I thoroughly enjoy watching this every week and can't wait to see each new episode. Syfi has a winner here.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this item specifically because I like to listen to LOUD music when I like to listen to LOUD music. I don't pollute my ears all day and night, but when I feel like rockin' I feel like rockin'. I own a pair of Klipsch Image S4i Earbud Headphones with Microphone and 3-Button Remote that I bought new, on ebay for $54. Nice earbuds (I  recommend 'em). Problem is, the Dell Laptop, the Droid X phone, and the ipod don't push it enough for me when I want to go LOUD. I've read a lot of reviews on headphone amplifiers, and they are mixed. I report that the fiio E6, at least when paired with the earbuds I have indicated, have a GREATLY enhanced volume and ROCK without distortion! My device's volume output, when set on ~70-80% and piped through the Fiio E6, produce SIGNIFICANTLY louder volume than without the device, and without distortion. Now I'm not a audio snob, but I've been in a band, been in a recording studio, cut an album, and these rock plenty! I was looking for a volume amplifier that wasn't just a little, and I got it with the Fiio E6! RECOMMENDED!
B004D38HOG|5.0|This brutally honest account of portias troubled times is truly refreshing. It would have taken alot of courage to expose her innermost fears to all. Combine that with her brilliant writing style and this book is definately a winner
B00005JLWN|5.0|I don't know how this movie went below my radar all these years, but I just finally heard about this movie for the first time, the other day, when looking at a filmography of Christian Bale. What an excellent movie! I compare this movie to [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]], as both of the movies feature lots of guns, martial arts, swordplay, and secrets. Both are loaded with action, have unexpected betrayals, depict life in the future, and mankind as a shadow of its former self.<br /><br />In some ways I prefer this movie over The Matrix, and in some ways I prefer The Matrix over this movie. Both of them are excellent action movies, and both were produced at about the same point in time. If, like me, you missed out on this, make sure to look for it the next time you're in the mood for some great sci-fi action.
0060873027|3.0|... but this really isn't a Michael Crichton book.<br /><br />Sadly, after his passing, this book was finished by Richard Preston.  Not to say anything bad of Mr. Preston, I've yet to read any of his works.<br /><br />However, Micro doesn't nearly fill the footprint of any other Crichton book that I've read, and I've read them all.<br /><br />The idea for the novel is solid, but it loses the feel of sci-fi reality that so many other similar MC novels have done well with (Prey, Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain).  It's also lacking his usual call for political or scientific reform.  The unfinished introduction seems to be the only words from Crichton in this book.<br /><br />I'm not sorry I read it, but nor am I thrilled that I did.  I'm sure it would have been great if he'd lived to finish it.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that although Pirate Latitudes was also released after his death, it's definitely worth a read.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Don't get me wrong, these guys are pretty good; they have a nice sound to them. But they're no Mumford and Sons.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book was amazing. I will say that it was really hard to get into, but I think that was intentional by the author. He did a wonderful job capturing the mother's personality through her words and writing style. This book was realistic and captivating! At about 74% of the way through it really picks up, and you won't be able to put it down! Overall I would recommend this book. It was worth all the time getting into it.
B000X107GI|5.0|What a great deal on this 5 pack.  Shipped Quickly and worked well with my product.<br />Just ordered more for future use.

B000002UWF|4.0|The CD is of great quality and arrived ahead of schedule.  Having heard many Louis Prima songs before ever owning an album, I thought all of his songs would be perfect and golden.  Well, in the Capitol Collectors Series there are a couple of weird filler songs but overall the songs are enjoyable.  I was even pleasantly surprised toward the end of the album, when I discovered fine quality jazz tracks.<br /><br />Overall I am glad to own some of Louis Primas greatest hits and I don't regret a thing. However, with how weird a couple of songs are I probably won't seek to own everything Prima's made.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you love dogs you will love this book.  This story is told from the perspective of the family pet who is wise beyond words.  He may not have a human voice, but can demonstrate his feelings through his actions and personality.  Many lessons to be learned from the art of racing in the rain.
B003ES5ZPK|3.0|Used this adapter for over 6 months and it worked right away.  The TV I am using it on is mounted to the wall so it was not moved or touched for the majority of the time.  Finally today I was trying to hook up a surround sound from the TV and now I cannot get a connection from my cable DVR box.  I have tried every combination of adapter/HDMI cable using the DVR box, a Moto Xoom with HDMI cord, and even another HDTV and have determined that this adapter is at fault.  Great product while it lasts, great design with endless ways to point the HDMI connector, just very sad that it stopped working and now a little skeptical about buying a second; especially after the other reviews.
0307959856|2.0|While Death At Pemberly is a readable if not great mystery, I purchased this book after reading a good newspaper review hoping for a chance to spend more time with Elizabeth Bennet, and in that hope I was greatly disappointed.  While there is a character with her name involved in but far from central to the book, none of her personality or wit appears.  Darcy's is a bit more present, but I get no sense of the Darcy of whom we become fond in the second half of Austen's novel.  Colonel Fitzwilliam is a far less likable character, and I find some of James's interpretations of situations in the original novel far different than mine.  (Was Charlotte really maliciously jealous of Elizabeth at the end of P and P?)  The characters here have far less wit than those in Pride and Prejudice, and it's a somber affair even before the murder.  If you want to read a murder mystery that has much less depthful characters than Ms. James's usual novels, you could probably do worse, but if you are hoping for any of the magic of Pride and Prejudice, re-read Pride and Prejudice.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very fun game. much like cafe world on facebook. add me storm 8 id is DPagan99 this is a game I'll continue playing.
B00006AW2P|4.0|This is the cd of the Stones first American LP originally released on London records. When compared to other British rock bands of the day (1963-1964) it sounds raw and undiluted. They were just beginning to cultivate their bad boy image and the harshness of some of the songs express this.  While it is almost all covers of US R&B, Blues or Soul artists it is quite enjoyable. Tell Me is the lone original is and hints to what Jagger and Richards would be able today. But the covers of Honest I Do, I'm a King Bee and Walking the Dog are a lot of fun.  Little by Little which seems to be a reworking of Jimmy Reed's Shame, Shame, Shame also feature Ian Stuart (the sixth official Stone), Phil Spector and Gene Pitney and is a hoot. Credited to Nanker Phelge (a group effort) and Phil Spector this was actually the B side of Not Fade Away which bookends the album. I highly recomend it. This is when the Stones were the best white R&B band in the world.  It is also when Ian Stuart was still with band (although he is not featured in the photos or given full credit) he received 1/6 of the Stones earnings.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I saw that this book was coming out in movie form so I knew it was imperative for me to read the book first. The phenomena of child mass murderers in today's culture is something that fascinates me in a very repellent fashion. I read this book to see if the author had some sort of insight into this problem. It was a difficult read in that it was emotionally wrenching. I had to periodically stop to take a breather and reset myself. The book was amazing. It did not answer the question of nature vs. nurture but it made you question your own beliefs involving that argument. A very worthwhile, thought-provoking read.
0307454568|4.0|I am afraid this is my least favorite of Mr. Larsson's three books. My favorite character simply was not actively involved in the plot enough to suit me.  It was still very enjoyable.  I would have felt I was missing something if I had not read it.

B002W5UVSM|5.0|This is a book to be enjoyed for it's language usage and it's story. It will make you laugh out loud at times. It deserved a Pulitzer prize!
B005DZMODI|4.0|I love Eric Clapton's music. He is a very talented person.  I'm not much of a Jazz person, but the combination of Winston and Eric produced some very nice music.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is absolutely awesome. Tremendous value for the price. Really good quality, lots of pouches and pockets, can't say enough about this bag. I've got a lot of gear so I was looking to carry less bags and keep more than just the camera in one bag.<br /><br />I keep a Canon HV20 in it with tons of other gear, lighting, cords, tripod mounts, wide angle lense, batteries,etc, and still has room another camera and extra gear. Looks small at first, but fits a lot of gear. Definitely worth every penny.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. I love the daily scripture plans. There are also plenty of translations available, including audio Bibles. I have paid $75 before for an audio Bible on cd. This app is well worth the download.
B005I6EU48|4.0|Bought the red cover for my Kindle touch. Fits in this case just fine. I love that it looks like a book. It is a beautiful cover. My only complaint are the gold stars on the binding of the book. I was not expecting them from the pictures and I think it detracts from the cover's beauty overall, but it is ultimately only a minimal detraction. After trying different covers and looking at my different options for hours on end I am very happy with this cover and I love my Kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|app provides daily passages to read. also the app is easily searchable for passages you would like to read. alll in all the app was a great DL.
0385043805|5.0|Like my title for this review?  what I have said is true and for those<br />who have never read this book-read it and find out what i mean...<br />This novel is many things like,suspense and mystery but,most of all,<br />it is a great story for those of us who have ever felt out of place around<br />other people and then,found acceptance by finding the truth, and love.<br /><br />A modest young woman(her name never revealed) marries the older, very<br />wealthy,max de winter as his 2nd wife.  This 2nd mrs de Winter arrives at the<br />family estate of Manderley and she is aware of something hanging in the<br />background.  What is it?? what had such control over everyone there and no one<br />speaks of it??? it is Rebecca.<br /><br />Rebecca is the FIRST wife of Max de Winter and not only is she smart, sophisticated,<br />with beauty to kill for, she is also dead.  dead... but she has firm control over all these<br />people at Manderley. I do not want to reveal the whole plot but,the author slowly unravels<br /> the whole story of Rebecca and what she was-the truth vs the myth.<br /><br />The story is told in first person by the no name 2nd wife. We read all her thoughts and<br />fears and the reader can't help but like her and feel sympathy when things are going<br />bad for her. There is a resolution at the end of the book. I rather like it. it is doing away<br />with the past forever and starting again. This book is extensive reading but,well worth it.<br />I think this is one of Daphne du Maurier's best.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|I have several Il Divo CD's and this is my most favorite.  It relaxes me as I listen to it on the way to work and home.  These men have the most wonderful voices individually and awesome together.  Can't wait for the next one.
B006WPSQVC|1.0|I was totally misled by the high ratings on amazon, and I did not read enough about the film to know what I was heading into. I thought it was going to be a story about fatherhood, but this is not a story, it is just a sequence of boring sermons. It does not deserve the one star I am forced to give it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|you Have to get it is awesome the best team lava game yet I have all of there games !!!!!
B004TSXUWY|1.0|I read the reviews and bought the book, but didn't enjoy it one bit. It would have been better as a short story of the last 20%, as the first 80% seemed to be padding that just didn't go anywhere. At times I felt as if I had amnesia like Christine the main charachter, in that I could have picked the book up anywhere in the first 80% and it wouldn't have made any difference. Anyway I persevered, on the hope that something would happen and grab my interest, but it didn't. Not the type of book for me.
B005MRUCAY|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I wish it had run beyond the first season.  I've also been watching the Merlin series which I also like, but Camelot was more geared towards adult viewers and more intelligent.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Well where can I start? This is the controller scheme we've been used to since the Playstation 2 days. Only that it's wireless... What I like about this is that it has an internal battery (no need to buy batteries) and it has capability. It uses a USB charging cable that also works with other devices such as my bluetooth. More importantly, this controller has small to minimal deadzone compared to that of an Xbox 360 controller. This means that the crosshairs or movement in-game is detected at the slightest push of the joystick. Now this is an upside because if playing with the Xbox 360 controller, you actually have to 'push' more making it tedious to the thumb. In short, the PS3 Dualshock 3 controller takes less joystick movement to aim in shooting games than to that of a Xbox 360 controller. If you use an Xbox 360 controller, then you have to move the joystick with more effort. Back to the review, the downside are the triggers on the Dualshock 3. They are not as good as the Xbox 360 triggers- it's your ergonomics that decides this.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book keeps you riveted from the first page on.  I find time travel fascinating so I may be somewhat biased in my review.  This book is very well written and the story line is unlike any other King book.  It was almost upsetting when the book was finished and left me thinking about the story for some time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app to have because you can read it all the time it is good to have because I can bring my kindle to school and read the Bible there
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its good to play if bored,sometimes to play as normal, but maybe not so good that u have to use coins to buy games
B005I6EU7U|4.0|This cover is very nice! It really looks like a book. Nice leather feel and holds the Kindle fire perfectly! A little spendy now that I have seen others that would have worked for less money.
B005B0QYMM|5.0|I had heard about this movie and had been wanting to see it for a while. And, while it wasn't the cheapest movie to purchase, I was happy with it. For a small budget movie (I by small I mean practically nothing) it was done very well. The effects are really well done and the timing is great and the gore is not over the top. A recommended film for those who love horror or suspense.
B0009QBLA8|1.0|Just watched this yesterday and it now replaces \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\\" as my personal worst flick of all time.  Throw in equal parts of Monty Python, Alien, Charlie Chaplin, George Orwell and Andy Kaufman into a cuisinart, puree for 10 minutes and dump into a toilet and you have you have the plot. There is virtually no dialogue, much less meaningful dialogue.  Since it has no plot, the \\"action\\" is excruciatingly painfully slow developing to whatever extent one would considered that it developed at all. The end befits the rest of this abortion, it just truncates in mid-frame.  Oh, and I was not ever fooled into thinking the damn thing was ever going anywhere, one reaches that conclusion within 60 seconds of the start.  But you have time invested, it's a crappy weather Saturday afternoon, so what the hell.  The one thing I concluded very early on from this waste of an hour and a half was that the director was attempting to play a prank on his audience, mocking anyone gullible enough to pay money to see this \\"masterpiece\\".  Only in that sense could it ever be considered the \\"cult classic\\" that it has evidently become.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is very accurate. I would reccomend it to anyone. you can check the days weather, the 3 hour stretch of weather, a radar, and news.in the weather. this is a great app
1423136802|5.0|I have to say that my wife brought one of these books home from a friend on loan and we both loved the series immediately, I had been looking at buying the books one by one locally when we found this deal. The books are the type you cant put down, they immerse you into their world and keep you interested from the first sentence to the last book.
B006PZBRCY|1.0|Not at all what I had expected, the action scenes were alright but the rest of the movie was terrible
B0073LWEXK|5.0|one of the best games ive ever played that is an app! its tricky and super fun! it kept me interested for hours! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a fun app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After the first book I couldn't put this series down until I was finished. Collins book had the right amount of action that kept you in suspense about what would happen next. Just simply an amazing series.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|love the widget! always keeps me reminded.  can organize into categories and time lines -- really great!<br /><br />can even use voice input on DROID!  greatly helpful.
B00168HARG|5.0|It is a fun series with good production values and acting that is better than most TV series.  The Blu-ray quality is good.  A printed episode summary would be nice, but that can be said of most series on Blu-ray/DVD.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|Perhaps if Jane Austen is alive she would have wrote a book like this one, so readers like me would catch a glimspe on whats's on the mind of Mr. Darcy.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm sort of maxed out on vampires and witches and the like, but this book totally captured my attention. Hamilton writes with a clear, vulnerable voice, and the main character is someone you instantly warm to. The book is sensitive to Wiccan beliefs, and did not ring false at all. I really enjoyed it.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|I am giving this one four stars simply because it entertained me, the scenery and props were great and I am rather fond of this particular story.  This is of course the most recent remake of the wonderful Bronte classic.  I am not sure how many shootings of this film have been made over the years but it is probably one of the most done and done again stories available. As I said, I am not sure how many of them there are but I do know, due to my wife, that I have seen them all down through the years.  There are many reasons for this of course but there are great pitfalls for the producers, directors and actors.<br /><br />The first of course is that viewers will be constantly comparing it to the last remake or the original.  There have been some splendid versions of this movie already made and lets face it, they are tough acts to follow.  If you read the reviews here you will find there are a lot of unhappy movie watchers due to this remake thing.<br /><br />Second, there are Bronte purists...a hardcore bunch of folks who show no quarter in their distain for anything that slightly deviates from the original novel.  I know how they feel.  I am a Tolkien purist and even though the movie, Lord of the Rings was a fine film, I still fussed and whined each and ever time the story line was not the one I had in my head after reading the books (many times).<br /><br />This particular film did leave quite a number of key scenes out from both the book and the previous movies.  I will be honest and tell you that I was not happy about this.  On the other hand, had I not seen those other versions or read the book, then I would have thought this film to be just fine and dandy.  There is also the actors.  While I applauded the fact that the makers used Mia Wasikowska in the staring role, I was not all that happy with Michael Rassbender.  Mia is not a raving beauty...I love her looks and find them fascinating but lets face it, she could be considered by many to be just a bit on the plan side.  This was how the original book character was.  As to Michael - I like his acting but for the life of me I simply could not place him in this role in my mind.  He simply is not ruthless and hard looking like the character of the book. I felt at times there could have been a bit more passion displayed between the leading lady and man.  But hey, this is just me.  Obviously and rightly there are other opinions as to the casting.<br /><br />I was not happy with the tinkering of scenes and events that took place and have to admit to having been thrown off until I picked up the rhythm of the movie.<br /><br />But overall, I simply blocked from my mind (what little of that there is) past versions of this book and indeed, the book itself, and simply tried to enjoy the movie as a stand-alone.  I was entertained and to be quite frank, that is really the only reason I bother watching movies for.<br /><br />I debated between the four star rating and a three star rating and decided to give it the benefit of a doubt.  This is one of those movies I wish I did not have to give a star rating to as it is the sort that you will either love or hat it....each will have to make their own mind up on that count.<br /><br />The quality of the DVD was quite good and I encountered no problems.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkslan side.

B005LAIGW8|2.0|** This review has MINOR spoilers **<br /><br />The devil demands his due in the second Ghost Rider film, Spirit of Vengeance.<br /><br />The movie is very heavy in special effects and sometimes they work quite well.  The man having his motorbike shot out from under him and keeps firing at a car as he slo-mo's off the ledge to his apparent death was very funny.  And I said to self, \\"Man that's corny.\\"  And not worth the premium 3D price I paid for it either.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage returns as the Ghost Rider, trying to suppress his demon so he travels all the way to Europe.  Why Europe?  Who knows?<br /><br />A pretty girl who has also made a deal with the devil has a child who is now of age and the devil wants him as a new body for his power.<br /><br />We meet a bounty hunter and his gang who just happens to be her ex-boyfriend and is hired by the devil to carry out the kidnapping and eventually becomes a hellish thing that can make anything decay - except Twinkies!  The Twinkies thing was funny for obvious reasons.<br /><br />Piss  Fire and Other Silly Scenes:<br /><br />Yep, we have Ghost Rider, albeit in a dream sequence thing, pissing fire and nodding and laughing.  Pretty immature and silly and adds nothing to the plot.  More a demonstration of the prowess of the computer compositors but that's about it.<br /><br />What's with David Goyer?  He writes Dark Knight but this film is on par, in a bad way, with Jumper.  More effects and not much of a story.  And no appearance by Stan Lee!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  The first film was better - more humorous without the toilet humor.  With Vengeance, there was not much in terms of 3D so save your money.  The backstory of the Rider having been an angel of justice was cool.  And the power to turn any vehicle into a hell-fire buggy was fun.  Just not a lot here.  Lots of flash and little substance.  Some corny lines and a whole \\"cult in the desert\\" thing that made no sense to me.  Who were these guys was not really explained.  Sorry Cage, back to basics.<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br />Directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.<br />Cast: Nicolas Cage, Violante Placido, Fergus Riordan, Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Idris Elba, Johnny Whitworth, Spencer Wilding, Sorin Tofan, Jacek Koman, Anthony Head, Cristian Iacob, Christopher Lambert.<br />2012 - 95 minutesined.

B004KKX80A|5.0|This is my favorite beyblade ever and very unique too. We really had a lot of fun with this beyblade.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't sleep until I was done with this book. All I could think of at work was getting home to finish it (and later the series)! I adore the characters and the settings. Peeta pretty much stole my heart as the boy with the bread.
B000002N3N|5.0|Remember when you were but a small child, and when you had trouble falling asleep your parents would come and bring you into a lull with nursery rhymes? In short, that's what \\"The Memory Of Trees\\" is, a collection of sweet and hushed songs designed to put one at ease and carry them into a peaceful sleep. Now one would think that since the title of the album deals with trees, the whole work itself would have an environmental theme to each of its songs, but it does not. Enya started this cycle when her debut album \\"The Celts\\" featured celtic chants and jigs, her second album \\"Watermark\\" had a collection of water themed songs, and her third album \\"Shepherd Moons\\" had songs that dealt with a world beyond this one. Actually, \\"The Memory Of Trees\\" does a very nice job of breaking this cycle, because there are only a few songs that deal with anything related to trees or the environment, and all of them are highlights of the album. These include \\"The Memory Of Trees\\", which is the opening track and one of her best songs ever composed, \\"China Roses\\", a beautifully crafted pastorale and \\"La Sonadora\\", a descriptive narration of dreams of landscapes. This album is probably one of the few Enya collections that have 3 instrumental tracks, all of which are very nice transitions to each section of the album. I do not advise you to play the album in its entirety in your car, because you will surely fall asleep. True that's the greatest strength of the album, but also its fatal weakness. If you manage to stay awake through all eleven lullabies, your purchase was very well worth it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I loved this movie. It has a great story. I also bought this for my little cousin and she loved it.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|In a dystopic future The Hunger Games tells the story of the titular games, enforced by the capitol Panem upon its twelve districts to ensure their subservience. The twelve districts must enlist two tributes each, one boy and one girl, to fight to the death in an arena until one is left standing. Things take a turn for the unexpected when Katniss Everdeen from District Twelve takes the placer of her sister, Primrose, for the seventy-fourth games...<br /><br />Where the book accomplishes with an unusual scenario and setting, it falls terribly short when it comes to believable storytelling. Katniss is terribly inconsistent with her storytelling, first by acting superior to a team of three stylists who are deemd &#34;frivolous&#34;, but soon after gushing over the dress created by her designer, Cinna.<br /><br />In the games themselves, the characters begin to act with sociopathic tendencies. Katniss never once questions if she is able to willingly murder, even to stay alive, and on her very first night already considers killing an intrusive opponent with little regard to the implications of thr actual act of killing. Especially jarring when the characters were commenting a few chapters back how &#34;horrible&#34; their entire predicament is. Later on, Katniss is completely unaware that she had doomed fellow human beings to their early deaths (indirectly or not) until she casually stops to consider her &#34;first (actual) kill&#34;.<br /><br />The love triangle that truly begins to bloom in the second book feels incredibly clumsy and awkward. Particularly because one of the characters could have been easily dropped and little of the narrative would have been lost. Katniss had already been fighting over her feelings for her fellow tribute to make the participation of a third party moot.<br /><br />By the third book, Katniss has simply grown to an unlikeable brat who wants everything to work her way without having to put effort into anything. After a questionable decision by an authority figure, she leads several minor characters through a battlefield in order to achieve nothing at all, making a good one-fifth of the story seem moot by her apparent lack of regret oveer the deaths of her allies.<br /><br />A singular problem in any book, the poor characterization, would have typically not netted such disatrous results were it not the fact that The Hunger Games be so heavily character-driven. The setting is strong, the narrative good, the writing different, but the poor execution of the characters (particularly the main character) make it an unusual, albeit forgettable, book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game everyday non-stop.the only thing I don't like is that you need to save up points to get more games.
B007APGHLY|2.0|I was highly anticipating the release of Tyga's official album, and anyone who had to ride in my car, because I played his mixtape none stop since it dropped, his lyrical power displayed throughout his mixtape made me think, watch out lil Wayne Tyga is about to outshine you.. Then I found out Tyga was coming in concert to my town, it was like Christmas in January. Then I bought this album, first listen I'm excited listing to a lil bit of every song all the while getting a little nervous because not a one track caught my attention. Replay the entire album I'm getting a mad because I still don't hear a track I love, like, could bare, or bump. 3rd 4th replay, fast foward to the 6th replay of the entire album, I then had to admit the cold hard truth, this album sucked compared to the mixtape. Oh how it pains me to type that 6 letter word but it's the truth. Now I must pounder if this dame should go to the concert, or cut my losses and re-gift these tickets.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|season 4 was great.  got hooked on the series and watched from the beginning.  very creative and unlike mainstream TV and very refresshing
B006UAWJS0|5.0|Another win for Vampire Diaries! It was an exciting season with more vampires, werewolves, hybrids, witches, and even ghosts. I am never disappointed with VD; the writing and acting is impeccable and it hasn't become a freak show like True Blood. If you like vampires, werewolves etc. watch all three seasons!!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I started this book on loan from a library - but no way could I get through this huge book in a 3 to 6 week period.  I found it on Amazon FOR FREE and am slowly making headway.  The story of Jean Valjean and Cossette is endearing but I could do without all the on-going background of cities, convents, layouts of prisons, etc.  I flip through these sections and focus on the real story.  I like the classics and this one is pretty easy to follow and understand.
B003Y059EK|4.0|This movie is fun but much darker than the '39 version. Fairuza does a great job, she's a very unappreciated actress. It's great for all ages and is more accurate to Baum's books.
B000067J1Y|5.0|Oldie but a goodie. Classic Charlie Sheen. Shipped fast. No complaints. Never get sick of watching this movie. Wier than sh it came in Blu Ray format.
0545265355|5.0|After reading Hunger Games, I ordered boxed trilogy from Amazon and finished second and third novels in record time.  Could not put them down.  I'm 73 and was just as engrossed as was my 13 year-old grandson to whom I gave the trilogy. The moral courage and humanity of the youngsters is a clear contrast to the inhumane greed and lust for power of the dystopian society's leaders.  The message of not giving in to dictatorial rules and regulations is always pertinent, but never more so than when our basic freedoms are being undermined.  The format of the message is perfect for all age groups.  A compelling heroine, well drawn characters, fast action, believable dialogue, and appeal to both females and males make these books perfect for all who love a good novel.
B007BLDFWG|5.0|This movie is very unique.  It is filled with suspense and the director has done a great job at seamlessly switching between scenes so that you don't know what's currently happening and what happened in the past until something appears which gives you context.  I really liked this movie as it wasn't predictable and didn't follow the typical hollywood storyline.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  I had a Sling Bag by Lowepro and sold it, because I needed a bag that fits my two Nikon cameras and some extra lenses, as well as batteries, cards, etc.  This bag from Amazon is perfect for me and easier to carry on my outings. It is well build and it has moveable protective walls inside.  The price is right too.
B006AN78XS|3.0|Bootstrapping the film with an approximate 10 minute tour of Paris is clear indication that the story line is weakly contrived. Contrived by leveraging remnant audience sophisticate interest in Paris and all things French. Thin story line, punctuated merely by Hemmingway and other period authors presence in after hours drinking establishments, designed to aquaint us with Woody's romantic rendition of the period. Sans stimulus, avec pleasant intro.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Have played and re-played this CD.  Never gets old.  New to Florence and the Machine but really enjoy their sound.  My first experience was actually their later CD, Ceremonials.  Enjoyed it so much that I decided to buy the Lungs CD.  I'd definitely buy their next album on the basis of my past positive experience.  Florence has a great voice.  Highly recommend.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|latest update erased my saved game. had most plants unlocked. also does not include endless mode like the other versions do.
B00457WZEI|3.0|\\"War Horse\\" was a really nice story.  I saw movie previews and wanted to go, but decided to read the book instead.  A simple little read more geared toward youth, but nice anyway.  Good price for a good story.  I love stories involving animals - but only if they end happy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I purchased the first Wool and was entertained but not in a hurry to buy the other installments. I rarely read short fiction--notable exceptions being Phillip K Dick, Gene Wolfe, and Vonnegut. Novellas tend to aggravate me since they're rarely balanced.  Either an overstuffed short story or a lazy, poorly developed novel.<br /><br />With the Omnibus edition, reading all 5 installments at once made for a much more satisfying story arc. The disjunction between the sections actually works to the story's benefit as a narrative device.<br /><br />I gave 4 stars for my review which is the highest I've ever given a self published author.<br /><br />The premise is reminiscent of the video game series \\"Fallout\\", but don't let that dissuade you. Howey has done an excellent job of world building. The characters are compelling and there still appears to be plenty of potential left to develop.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|There are a good number of books that you cannot stop reading. The Orphan Master's Son, is a book that you must stop reading. To do otherwise could result in loss of sleep at the very least, and a visit to a neighborhood psychiatrist, at the most extreme.To be certain, it demands a more willing suspension of disbelief than that which would  render 1984 as utopian. And yet, you do believe. And that is frightening.<br /><br />Mostly, you need to think - something that the characters are allowed to do only so long as the scope of their thought is limited to no more than the width of a single fermi. Every nanosecond of every life is a surrealistic nightmare that is accepted as normality.  Comparison to any other seemingly totalitarian omnipresence falls far short.<br /><br />You must stop reading - even if it is for no more than a few seconds - if only to ask the person sitting  next to you on a subway car: \\"Would you believe.....?\\"<br /><br />mario
0307959856|5.0|For someone who loved \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and also is a great admirer of P. D. James, I wondered what these two very different authors, who lived centuries apart, could possibly have in common and I opened the book with some trepidation. But I was not at all disappointed and found the story to be a real treat as the incomparable Ms.James transports us back to the world of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, six years after their marriage. Living happily on their great estate Pemberley and the parents of two healthy boys, they are busy preparing for their annual autumn ball. But on the night before the ball their calm is brutally shattered when a coach containing Elizabeth's flighty sister Lydia, who is married to the less than admirable Wickham, pulls up to the door. An hysterical Lydia falls out screaming that Wickham has been killed and this sets off a murder mystery that only a master storyteller like P. D. James could solve. The result is a book that is both suspenseful and charming, and held my interest to the very last page with its many quirks and surprises. A great read.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is one of the books that you pick up and cant put down! Its a heart wrenching fiction but based on non fiction historical event. So you end up learning quite a bit of an event during the Holocausts that you don't hear much about. But don't take my word for it, read it!
B00004R99U|4.0|I bought Pocahontas 2 for my 4 year old daughter. She loves it and I think it is very good too. It has some great songs in it. I am glad I bought it.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|very relaxing and enjoyable.  do not put into cloud if you have not finish the whole thing, because you will have to start over.  great on the kindle fire.
B004LWZW42|4.0|...With reservations. Though, as a superhero movie, this one had it all and did it right, it screwed up the whole Xmen legend so badly, it wasn't funny! Here's Raven being childhood friends with Charles Xavier. Here's Banshee as a teenager without a trace of an Irish brogue....here's Moira McTaggart as an American CIA agent and NOT a Scottish biologist! Here's Alex Summers popping up almost ten years too early.....ANGEL as a petite young WOMAN with insect wings instead of the bird-winged fella in Xmen 3....No Iceman, no Cyclops, no Marvel Girl, and Magneto and Xavier working together twenty years too early. Sebastian Shaw turned up VERY late in the Xmen mythos and so did Emma Frost. And where did Darwin come from??<br /><br />However, something about John McAvoy's and Michael Fassbender's acting, the cocky, over-confident manner that Kevin Bacon uses to parlay Sebastian Shaw, (a role [[I]] never would have picked him for!) and a well-written script make this one of the more enjoyable superhero movies since \\"Iron Man'. If you ask me, I think McAvoy ought to get the Xavier role for good, for he does it MUCH better than Patrick Stewart.  Likewise, Fassbender is a quantum improvement over Ian McKellen. It's probably the acting that sets this production apart from both the eariler Xmen movies AND most other superhero flicks. The actors seem thoroughly convinced they are whom they're playing, as fantastic as those characters may be. The writers, (who REALLY ought to check their source material more thoroughly,) also put the powers that the individual heroes have to good use, as well as putting good dialogue in the mouths of McAvoy and company.<br /><br />It's also a testament to the writers' talents that the movie works even WITH the continuity discrepancies between known Xmen legend and what appears on the screen. It's a shame they were probably a LITTLE too conscious of the fact that most people who would see the movie would have almost NO working knowledge of the Xmen of the comics, and hence, wouldn't complain. However, it WOULD be nice, if, like the people behind \\"Daredevil\\", they had cleaved a little closer to what history had been laid down about the characters....<br /><br />Highly enjoyable, nonetheless....of the comics, and hence, wouldn't complain.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|I was disappointed when I realized I had lost my part 1 of deathly hallows. I was a little suspicious about the dvd price being so low for five dollars. But I took the chance. The delivery was super quick. Came in three days time. I was surprised to learn that the DVD was the actual DVD, not a pirated copy etc. It was the real thing. The quality of the dvd is excellent and I have no problems viewing it on my computer or my T.V. Don't let the other comments about the DVD being dark and hard to see unless you have the lights on prevent you from buying the DVD. It's just like the theater version. I have no problems viewing it in the lights or anywhere else. It's perfect. So glad to be reunited with my love. Thank you for being an honest seller!
B002PNAY9C|5.0|Read the frist of the series and enjoyed the book. So decided to by the rest of the series, they are well written. I am on the last of the series,and have enjoyed them all. Ihave recomand them to y friends who also read a lot.

B002Q0F6V0|5.0|What a surprise! I had no idea Alice in Chains had released this is 2009 - I guess I had lost hope and was pretty much stuck with the stuff I have from the 90s. This was a nice surprise. This is the way rock should be.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I didn't know if I was going to like this game at first, but I found myself addicted to it last night. I couldn't go to sleep until I beet one game and then I started another game and I had to beet that one to. It went on and on.

B004LROUNG|5.0|As always this was pure action.  Grisham never misses with an exceptional read.  In fact, it was so good I purchased a hard book copy for a friend's 96th birthday.  She was overjoyed with the gift.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Hunger Games. Then again, that doesn't make me special because everyone is. I get why people love this book and I'm glad I read it. It really stuck with me for a few days and I don't know what to expect in the next two books.<br /><br />Let's start with Katniss. She's cold and calculating and she's a survivor. She's everything you want in a heroine. At the same time, she's frustrating. She's not exactly what I would look for in a girlfriend. She's manipulative and always has survival in the back of her mind. Just ask Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />The surprise standout to me was Cinna. I've been seeing pictures of Lenny Kravitz and I tried to divorce myself form his image while I read the book. I didn't have to work very hard. Cinna is a character all his own and I think he's sort of the dark house candidate for best character in the book. He's a nice mix of sensitive and revolutionary. I don't think anyone in the capitol understands Katniss better than Cinna.<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of Peeta. I thought he was oafish and dramatic. His relationship with Katniss is a fine example of gender reversal and their dynamic is fascinating. Their relationship is painful.<br /><br />I admit, I wasn't sure how it would end. Collins kept me guessing. It was fairly obvious that she wasn't going to die, as Jennifer Lawrence has signed on for the entire franchise, but I really couldn't figure out how things would ultimately turn out.<br /><br />This book is worthy of all the hype and it exceeded my expectations. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the trilogy, and even more excited to see the movie in a few weeks.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.
0062112430|5.0|Delirium is such a wonderfully written novel--one with tremendous emotional depth. Lauren Oliver truly has a way with words, and she really knows how to write a powerful and striking story that will hold your attention all the way through! I especially appreciate how great she is at translating the emotions of her characters so that you feel everything right along with them. The premise of this book peaked my interest immediately, and once I started reading it the story proved to be just as engaging. There are quite a few powerful messages to be interpreted as well, ones that really make you stop and ponder.<br /><br />The characters in this book live in a world where love is considered a disease, and it's mandatory that everyone get \\"cured\\" when they reach a certain age. This cure makes everyone a more sad, lesser version of themselves; and I couldn't help but think of these cured individuals as \\"drones\\", because that's exactly what they are. Pretty much every aspect of these people's lives are controlled; who they marry, how many kids they have, etc. Big brother is always watching and listening, ready to jump on you and persecute you if you don't follow the structure and rules laid out for the entire population. They enforce this lifestyle by means of cruel punishments and violence. Everyone is brainwashed into thinking that they live this way because it's in their best interest.<br /><br />This book is told through Lena's perspective. She's approaching her 18th birthday (curing age), and her story starts off with her being excited and relieved for the cure. It was such a rewarding experience seeing how much her character grows throughout this book. She was one of those cautious people who was scared into thinking that love is a heinous disease that will threaten your welfare and cause chaos. Her views were sort of understandable though, given her family background and past circumstances. But her views and her world changes when she meets Alex. I loved watching their romance progress and how much Alex actually changed Lena's entire life and way of thinking. Their love is just so pure and beautiful, and I was rooting for them from the beginning. Alex awakens so much in Lena; like hope for a better life and a fierce need to fight for what she feels so strongly. She learns to fight against the odds of being a product of her environment.<br /><br />I also really think that Lena's best friend, Hana, is fantastic. Despite the limitations they were put under, their friendship is so strong and loyal. Hana is definitely one of my favorite \\"best friend\\" characters of all time. Lena's cousin, Gracie, is also such a special character. For being a little girl who never speaks, her actions and silence are profound in my opinion. I'm hopeful that these two will be around for more of the series.<br /><br />Delirium was quite the ride, and I can only imagine that the second book will include just as much intensity as this one did. I know that I was definitely an emotional wreck during the final moments of this book, which left me yelling and teary-eyed. Therefore I'm really itching to get my hands on the second book and find out what Lena's future will bring!
0385737955|5.0|I just recently got a Kindle and this is the first book I downloaded. Of all the YA books I've read in the past year, The Maze Runner is by far the most unique.<br /><br />The plot was fantastic. Dashner is great at keeping up the mystery of the maze and there were times when I felt just as frustrated as the characters. The book leaves a lot of questions, and that's great, seeing as there are two more books in the trilogy to look forward to. Thomas is a great protagonist and I don't mind following him into the next book.<br /><br />For the first time, I felt like I found a YA book that wasn't completely romance centric. Even the Hunger Games is, on some level, a book about romance. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the dystopian genre.

B00026WU9Q|5.0|I first came upon Bob Dylan's music when I was growing up because he was my dad's favorite artists. I'll admit that at the time I thought it to be annoying to listen to and I opted to listen to the 90's pop music that my cousins were into at that time. That was what I like to call my \\"dark age\\" when it came to my musical tastes. It was only about a year ago that I first  \\"really\\" discovered Dylan, and by that time I had grown to love classic rock over any other genre of music. Bringing It All Back Home was the first album I bought of Dylan's and I only bought it because I knew I liked \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". When I first listened to it all the way through, I was literally awestruck at the quality of the album.<br /><br />From the opening rocker \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" to the acoustic closer \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", this album doesn't have a dud on it. Especially notable songs are \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", \\"Gates of Eden\\", \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)\\", and the previously mentioned \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" and \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\", as well as the classic \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". This album also includes the humorous tracks \\"On The Road Again\\" and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" and the other few songs are great in their own way. I don't want to go into much detail on the tracks because I feel that people should experience it for themselves and not have to be told what every song is about.<br /><br />This is probably one of the best Bob Dylan albums to start with in my opinion because you get a taste of both his rock and folk music on just this one album.
006197806X|5.0|I am not going to get into to much detail.  I think all the reviews that gave this book  5 stars is very accurate.  I do think that anyone who read Delirium should read Hana, I think it's only available on kindle for 2.99, but it does explain a few things from Delirium. :)
B006ON41FC|5.0|This app is awesome my brother and I like it so much You should get it don't believe the bad rates
0061726834|5.0|I read reviews on this before I got the book, and for the reviews that said it was slow paced I do not agree at all. I really got into this book and I could not put it down.  I do suggest after reading Delirium and before you go to read Pandemonium you should read Hana.  I think it is only available on kindle, its a short story but explains a few things and the ending was well worth the read.

1451648537|5.0|There will never be a more thorough work of the intense and driven character of Steve Jobs in his relation to the company he founded and then came back to save. Even if his beloved wife decides to write a book one day, she won't have the same access to the business associates that Issacson was able to insightfully interview for this definitive work. I came away with a much better understanding of the man and the firm. A genius in many ways but not one I would have enjoyed working for myself! As his health was fading Mr. Jobs was concerned about Apple's ability to awesomely survive and grow particularly in light of events at HP one of the companies he and Woz both idolized as youths. The language is a bit salty but the author kept to the character of the man at the center of what is today the world's most valuable company. A great read for those with any significant interest in Apple, Mr. Jobs or Silcon Valley.

B000PC6A3E|4.0|I've seen Dark Knight a bunch of times and own it on blu-ray, but had never gotten around to seeing Batman Begins.  My wife had seen it, but I had introduced her to Dark Knight.  She claimed Dark Knight was way better than Batman Begins.  She saw Batman Begins when it first came out.  Well after watching Dark Knight one weekend, we decided to watch Batman Begins.  We came to the conclusion that if you watch Dark Knight first, and then Batman Begins, Batman Begins comes out looking a whole lot better than if you watch the movies in order of release.  They should have produced Dark Knight first and then Batman Begins, as Batman Begins feels like a much better \\"answer the questions from Dark Knight\\" movie than a standalone story.  So if you haven't seen either, buy both on blu-ray (awesome visuals), watch Dark Knight first, and then Batman Begins.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Ok, well, where to start. Comparing this 'Epic' to J.R.R. Tolkien; and by comparison to Tolkien I am guessing they mean Lord of the Rings. There is no comparison. George Martin is a good author, is he up there with Tolkien? Sadly, no, not in my opinion. I have to be honest, just because HBO is making a series out of this story does not make it great. Anyone who has honestly read cover to cover as I have, is most likely feeling a little disappointed right now. You can tell that George Martin is letting the story guide itself page by page. Many characters who have a place in this story are forgotten for a long while. Those characters who really are not that important get the stage light for only a short while leaving you confused feeling like, \\"who the hell is this person again?\\" while I wonder to myself, what the heck does this person have to do with anything except for maybe an appearance in momentary stardom.<br /><br />You don't make an epic by killing off all the good guys and allowing the \\"bad\\" guys to survive. Now what about the part in fantasy lore where the good guys rescue the helpless. George Martin leaves you thinking \\"what the fudge dude\\" again, really, are you serious? Every time someone gets close to being rescued they get snatched away again only to drag the already over large story to an even more inflated compilation.<br /><br />I am disappointed by this epic but I will give Martin my money because I'm already dragged into this inflated mess. If you are new to the story, beware, be afraid, be very afraid... Be prepared to be dragged all over his continent, between a million different and sometimes very unimportant characters.<br /><br />Sorry George, you leave me wanting.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love Plants vs. Zombies. The game is fabulous.  Unfortunately, the application is not. One crash is too many, but this game crashes at least once a week, first freezing, then required my DroidX to restart. It's frustrating.<br /><br />I also miss the garden and mini-games. They would be perfect for when you can't complete an entire level while out and about with your phone.

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|I am a bg Woody Allan fan.  I own several box sets and have seen many of his movies more than once.  Unfortunately, this movie is a stinker of monumental proportions.  The ONLY redeeming quality is the stunningly gorgeous cinematography.  The actors are miscast (I found Owen Wilson totally uninteresting), the music is horrible, and the plot is uninteresting.  Not worth renting let alone purchasing.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I first found WOOL, a 99-cent science fiction book rated 5 stars, I knew it was for me. It's really short, but makes you want more. All I can say is that each book in the series is better than the ones before it! Hugh Howey is an extremely gifted author and he knits an amazingly addictive story. You might as well buy the Omnibus Edition so you have all 5 books at hand. I'm looking forward to reading much more of Hugh's work.<br /><br />BUY THIS! You will not regret it.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|This Complete Rubinstein is an obvious must-have for classical music lovers, and the previous version is a collector worth several times the price of this very set... but you can save close to 30% of the selling price on Amazon.com if you buy from Amazon houses in Europe. I just bought my copy from Amazon.fr for the Euro equivalent of a little over $200. If you don't know this, note that the advertised price on the French Amazon includes the VTA tax, but it is deducted at checkout if you live in the US. The break you get from not paying the equivalent of our sales tax was three times the shipping cost! In this economy, it does feel good to have a good deal, thanks Amazon for promoting competition among your different websites.<br /><br />And now the set: it is first class.<br /><br />First, the packaging itself: classier than Decca Sound, DG111 and the like, even though these are perfectly adequate. With the Rubinstein you get a hardbound book that includes a listing of all the music in the set, both by composer and by CD. And the CDs themselves are handsomely presented with original artwork and vinyl-style look, which I like very much. I find the original sleeve notes very valuable. The first CD I played, for example, was the 1972 interpretation of Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 (CD 116), and the sleeve includes on the back a note telling us that Rubinstein always considered Brahms as a living composer, because indeed he was alive until Rubinstein turned 10. I had never seen this insight mentioned before, and it makes me enjoy the presentation even more.<br /><br />And as far as the content, it is vibrant, fresh, original, sometimes bold... and you would never guess that the most recent record included here is 37 years old! Rubinstein was granted royal treatment in the recording studios for pretty much the entire length of his career, and every CD I played confirmed it. At the end of the day, in some cases it made made me reconsider old choices of \\"what is the best-ever interpretation of ____?\\" (Brahms Piano concerto No. 2 is a great example), and sometimes it shed new light on the score without, at least at this point, reaching the heights of an old favorite. But all the music I listened to had the distinct quality of being played with a sublime touch deserving the attention - and a place of choice in the CD library of classical music lovers. Boxsets are becoming fashionable, and it is a good thing because they bring to light many records that had become either forgotten or unavailable - but I believe this particular set will remain a king among all the offerings present and future.er interpretation of ____?\\" (Brahms Piano concerto No. 2 is a great example), and sometimes it shed new light on the score without, at least at this point, reaching the heights of an old favorite.

B0060CXAHC|5.0|At first, the basic idea of the movie seems pretty simple: Quirky alien comes to Earth, teams up with an oddball little girl, and gets into all kinds of wacky shenanigans and the occasional heartwarming scene. It sounds like ET or ALF or something, but really, it's so much more. The kid isn't just a caricature or some manipulative sentimental cutout. She's practically a real kid. She's bizarre in the most unpredictable ways, she's funny, she's vibrant, she lashes out and mopes, she's immature, she's enlightening -- she's everything a real toddler is, all the contradictions, charms, headaches, and magic wrapped up and captured perfectly.<br /><br />And the real beauty is that the movie isn't ultimately about the aliens. They're more like window-dressing, set pieces, or mood-setters. What the movie really is, through and through, is the story of two sisters who've lost their parents. They're both dealing with the grief, and moreover, they're learning how to move on. Nani, the older sister, finds herself suddenly having to be a mother. She has to find work, put her own life on hold, try to eke out some small living and make a proper home for her own baby sister.<br /><br />Meanwhile, someone from child services is watching her every tiniest step, threatening to take the little sister away if Nani can't get a job and get her life into shape, but even he's not the villain. No, he's sympathetic as anyone. He doesn't want to separate the kid from the only family she has left. He sees the tragedy in all this, too, and ultimately, he's just trying to look out for the well-being of a little girl, even if taking her away would break his heart.<br /><br />This really isn't a movie where you come out thinking, \\"Oh, that alien. He was so wacky!\\" Instead, he's really just this outsider who comes into their family and almost ruins everything. He loves them, and they love him, but there are just so many obstacles, so much adversity, and all they really want is to be together, to bea family. But the sisters are already in such a bad place, beaten down by life itself for no good reason, and he just adds so many more complications... But maybe family is worth complications. Maybe they can find a way. And that's really what the movie is about.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|A very entertaining light reading from Sophie Kinsella. I love the story,the characters,the conflicts and very engaging. I laughed all throughout and rooted for the main characters. I would love to read it over and over and highly recommended for all.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|This is good value for repeated listening. The songs are so good and its great to hear so many artists giving their take. Some of the performers I hadnt heard of before, but that adds to the appeal. It doesnt detract from Bobs own recordings or from the great songs themselves. How would you do a Dylan song if you had the chance to record ?  Its a wonder Bobs songs have not been redone and been a hit on the singles charts since the sixties...Maybe Adele could get a hit out of one. Brilliant to hear Eric Burdon get an outing with \\"Gotta serve somebody\\" and do it so well.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I've been a Van Halen fan forever, but I enjoy rock of all stripes. Set me up with Sex Pistols, Pixies, Elvis, the Who, Foghat, the Shins, TV on the Radio, Sleater-Kinney. As Joan Jett and others have said, I love rock 'n roll.<br /><br />But it's 2012. Is rock still relevant? The Rolling Stones are celebrating 50 years of being a group (albeit with substantial changes). You certainly don't hear any new rock on the radio of vintage RS quality, or at least anything new that's not either focus-grouped or trying too hard to emote. Not that emoting while rocking is necessarily bad, of course, but isn't it fun when the emotion is \\"whoo hoo!\\"?<br /><br />What I want to do is continue to blow out my ear drums (OK, maybe not; did that enough as a teenager.) and have fun while doing it. These guys, 10 years my senior, know how to help. You can't listen to this and help but think they are having fun making joyous, raucous rock and roll music, and then sharing it with you. And you just don't hear that on the radio so much anymore. Thank you VH with DLR.

B0071MV540|2.0|Some laugh out loud moments/lines, but very \\"meh...\\"  Totally a \\"b\\" or even \\"c\\" movie. A lot of preamble leading to a not too interesting heist and a way boring ending. Alan Alda was sufficiently creepy but the rest of the cast never gets a chance to really shine or do anything non-cliche. Eddie Murphy's character just kind of fades away at the end. I dont recommend it.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Great workout and challenging! In less than half hour you know you got a solid workout done. I just wish you could fast forward through the beginning. Listening to the same thing every day is not necessary. Also, a workout plan should be laid in more detail, ie does this need to be done everyday? Work through soreness? If I want to continue after the 30 days, when are good rest days?
0545403359|2.0|I spent the afternoon reading this novel little novel. I'm assuming it was written for children. Perhaps 12yr old boys?<br />The plot is a twist on an old cautionary tale warning of the evils of war for they are destructive and serve no goodness.<br /><br />Using the horse as a tepid non biased narrator we are vaguely introduced to the characters in Europe during the First world war. Joey, a young horse is separated from his mother after he is purchased by a drunken abusive farmer at the weekly Tuesday market.<br /><br />After the brief and cool introductions to characters shallower than a wading pool we are taken on adventures with a horse who does seem to enjoy the life of hard good work.<br /><br />While the morals, principles and ideals of the story are good lessons, war is bad, promises are broken by death, friendship and love is eternal, the over all tone was weak and never truly left the reader with feelings of war-full dread and peril.<br /><br />Perhaps the movie will be more exhilarating.
0525951652|2.0|Fall of Giants is another of Follett's fantastically researched and well articulated epic novel. While the writing style is much lighter and scantly detailed the pace and speed in which the book carries you is intense. I myself LOVE history as was enthralled with Pillars of the Earth,' and 'World without an end'. Both books I finished under a week.<br /><br />This like his others has the classic feeling of following just juxtaposed behind your central characters. Peering into their most intimate moments in life. However I would say this his weakest building of characters I have seen in his collection. In World With out and End and Pillars of the Earth I was gripped to the pages and in love with them all. Prior included.<br /><br />The book's tone carries a heavy Welsh fog of struggle. The dampness of the Coal mining village, the frigid tundras of Serbia. We are carried in the ongoing urgency of a world and its people trying to evolve about 'class' 'caste' and 'aristocracy'. While the historical aspect could be daunting and the Russian revolution a buffets of brain food, I found again the characters all except Billy Twice and Walter had no soul.<br /><br />Fantastic read if you are looking for a lovely history lesson prepare to pace your self!<br />You'll want to devour the reading as fast and as often as you can, so give your eyes a break.

0375869026|5.0|I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse.<br /><br />  August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a facial deformity that prevented him from going to a mainstream school--until now. He's about to start 5th grade at Beecher Prep, and if you've ever been the new kid then you know how hard that can be. The thing is Auggie's just an ordinary kid, with an extraordinary face. But can he convince his new classmates that he's just like them, despite appearances?<br /><br />August Pullman is a typical ten-year-old boy.  He likes sports, video games, and Star Wars.  He is an intelligent kid.  Like some kids these days, Auggie has been home-schooled by his mother, but his school year, Mom thinks it is time for Auggie to go to a real school.  Dad does not agree saying sending Auggie to school would be like (sending) a lamb to the slaughter.<br /><br />Mom and Auggie go to Beecher Prep to meet the principal, Mr. Tushman.  Auggie ends up on a school tour with three kids that would be in his fifth grade class, should he attend. Julian, Jack Will, and Charlotte are nice and show Auggie most everything including the science lab, gymnasium, and cafeteria.  Beecher Prep is an exclusive and demanding school.  Kids take entrance exams just to be a student there.  Unknown to Aggie, he has already passed the tests.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months, Auggie is attending Beecher Prep and in Ms. Petosa's homeroom.  Lucky for him, Auggie sits next to Jack Will in nearly every class.  They get along great . . . until Halloween.  However, Auggie did make a true friend in Summer, his lunch table mate.  Fifth grade has its ups and downs.  Most kids will not touch him, acting as if he has the plague or some other awful contagion.  Aggie makes it through fifth grade and returns for sixth grade.  This year will be the most trying year of his young life.<br /><br />I really, absolutely, loved this story.  Wonder is the debut novel from R.J. Palacio and she entered the children's lit world with guns a blazing.  The characters are well developed and have distinctive voices.  Nearly everyone has changed in some way by the end of the book, including the reader.  She must have spent her days and nights around ten-year-old kids because the dialogue is spot-on.  Good kid, bad kid, parent, teacher, or \\"extras,\\" Ms. Palacio has the correct, believable voice.<br /><br />When I first saw the cover, I wanted to read this book.  The pale blue background of a young kid with one eye had a way of drawing me to it.  After reading the book, I think the cover is wrong for the book.  Auggie has severe facial abnormalities including a cleft palate, eyes much to low on his head, and ears that are nearly non-existent.  If the cover is suppose to be of Auggie, the designer missed it, big time.<br /><br />Auggie is 10 when the book opens, having survived more surgeries, treatments, and therapies than most of us will ever experience, and is about to go to school for the first time.  I remember middle school to be a game of who's popular and who isn't, only notched down a degree from high school. Add parents that are often as bad as, if not worse than, the kids and middle school becomes a place not for the timid . . . or the new, and definitely not for the noticeably different and possibly scary.<br /><br />I think Auggie represents anyone who is different.  He is the child fighting cancer that lost his hair, the kid in a wheelchair, or the one attending special ed.  He is the fat kid, the nerd, the shy kid, and the kid without friends.  Auggie represents all of us at some time or another.  We all have or had a blemish or two, felt excluded, talked about, maybe even feared.  August Pullman endures all of those, at the same time, from kids at a cruel stage in life, when being accepted and part of the group is extremely important.  I think Ms. Palacio captured this realistically without being maudlin<br /><br />At 320 pages, Wonder is still within thereach of middle grade capabilities.  The chapters are short, easy to read, and the words simply flow making the turning of pages a pleasure, not a chore.  The point of view does change every now and then.  We get to read about Via, Auggie's sister.  She tells us what it's like having a brother who rightly demands all of mom and dad's attention.  Jack Will, who unknowing crushes Auggie with his sharply barbed words, tells us the friend side.  Mostly though, it is Auggie we hear from and his trials being \\"that kid.\\"<br /><br />Wonder is easy to read, difficult to put down, funny, and sad.  If you can read this story without shedding at least one tear, you did not pay attention to what you were reading.  Do not let that scare you away.  This is not a tearjerker; it is a thought-jerker.  I think Wonder should be required reading for every middle grader and teen.  Awards will accumulate and by the end of 2012, Wonder will be be one of the top ten middle grade books of this year.<br /><br />Note: I received the digital version of this book from net galley, courtesy of the publisher, Alfred  A.

0451197968|3.0|'The Running Man' was published in 1982 under Kings pseudonym Richard Bachman.<br />Without ever seeing the movie cause it looked crappy I decided to finally read this book knowing that the book is always better than the movie. And this is not a bad book by any means, it's quite good but I felt that it should have been explained a little better.<br /><br />The book is about a man, Ben Richards, who is married to his wife Sheila who share a five year old daughter, Cathy, who is dying from Asthma/Lung Cancer. It's why Ben Richards enters the Running Man contest, prize money for a doctor for his daughter. Taking place in the year 2025 the pollution of the air is so toxic that most deaths are lung related and Asthma is always the cause of death.<br />The Games Network, a government operated game show station that runs live all over the world via free-vee(TV). Once the game starts you are free game for anyone in the world, a enemy of the state. The goal is to survive thirty days, 100 dollars per hour or deduct a hundred if you kill someone. No one has ever survived the entire 30 days. Ben meets various people in his trek, whether he can trust anyone or not, his braveness and quick thinking are his strong points. During the games 'Hunters' are sent out to capture the running man, trained elites/assassins.<br />I don't want to give to much else away. It's a very fast read and I mostly enjoyed it, yet I did not expect the ending, and even now I don't know how I feel about said ending. Classic King?(Bachman?)maybe, you decide.<br /><br />Maybe if the lead character, Richards wasn't such a jerk and a tool, I could have liked him and the book more, so I didn't feel anything for him except for his unfortunate family.

B003Y5H57E|1.0|Nothing rings true and honest in this movie. Since when does a 13 year old boy need a baby sitter -- who is 17? A woman who has been clean and sober for 5 years chooses to hang out in bars? And then is offended when a guy buys her a drink? The coincidences, the humor, the \\"poignant moments\\" all seemed forced. I know this is supposed to be a comedy -- but still. Not surprisingly, the previous credits for the writer include Cars 1 & 2. His cars feel more human than the people do in this one.
067144901X|5.0|This is one of my 2.5 year old's favorite books. He has always giggled at it! But he \\"read\\" it to me last night! He opened it up to a page and said \\"dog say BOW WOW WOW! Kitties say meow.\\" I almost cried! The simple rhymes/words are easy to remember, even for little ones. The pictures are great too, very cute. We went through the whole book last night and he told me what every animal was and what they \\"say\\". He was/is a late talker, and this book really prompts him to try new sounds. It is also very easy to prompt some other learning while your reading without \\"interrupting\\" a story. Some nights we do colors, and/or numbers (1,2,3 dogs, pigs are pink ect..) after reading the words.<br />I looked the author up last night and was excited to see that she has so many other titles (and saddened because I can't afford them ALL!). We are now awaiting the mail for more Boynton books!
B0064NTZQ2|2.0|I wanted to like this movie. But man it was sloooow. Scenes took forever to get anywhere. Throughout Gosling just stares expressionlessly and says nothing more than a couple words at a time. I guess he was going for a modern day Steve McQueen. But it just comes off as wooden and uninteresting. (As did McQueen often times.) The graphic violence, when it comes, is almost welcome -- waking Gosling out of his funk and gives him something to do. The story didn't exactly track either -- it depends on a pretty major coincidence. I respect movie makers who don't go the easy, predictable route, and here I commend them for the effort -- but not so much for the result.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />A black-and-white silent movie made in 2011?  How refreshing!  Now that's thinking outside the box.  When I heard about this movie, I had to see it since I like some of the silent movies from the 1920s era.  This movie is an example of the concept of \\"less is more\\" - the less technology that's used, the better off the movie is.  This movie is silent.  No words are spoken.  Just the musical score by Ludovic Bource is playing throughout.  The actors' facial expressions let you know what is transpiring onscreen.  This movie is also in black-and-white.  The movie being black-and-white and silent might turn off a lot of people, especially young people, but I say give it a chance.  This movie won five Academy Awards on February 26, 2012.<br /><br />Set in the period from 1927-1932, this movie is about an actor from the silent era whose career is going downhill when talkies start taking over as the new and preferred type of movie.  He soon has a relationship with a young up-and-coming actress.  That's all I want to say without spoiling anything.  This movie pays homage to the silent era in movie history.  It also pays homage to a lot of the greatest movies ever made.  One thing you'll notice is that a piece of Bernard Herrmann's music to Vertigo (1958) is used in this movie.  Vertigo star Kim Novak said that Herrmann's music to Vertigo shouldn't be in this movie.  I agree with her.  This movie is definitely a refreshing idea, but to include music from Vertigo was a mistake.  It made me immediately have a flashback to that movie.  It actually distracted me from concentrating on The Artist.  Instead, I was picturing Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart.  Original music should have been used instead.  That's the only problem I have with The Artist.<br /><br />I give this movie 4 1/2 stars, rounded up to 5, and it isn't because of the use of Herrmann's music.  I just feel it's a 4 1/2 star movie.

0307352145|5.0|This book is helping me realize it's okay for me to feel the way I do in social situations--sometimes they're easy, sometimes, they're paralyzing. The tips in the book on how to adapt to an extroverted world while acknowledging and embracing my introversion were very helpful. I'll be sure to seek out downtime when I need to recharge after draining socialization and to set realistic goals for myself. Growing up, I had always felt that there was something terribly wrong with me for being so quiet, and I found it so difficult to adapt to being \\"normal.\\" It's a relief to see that Susan Cain's book is published--and demonstrates that it's okay to be introverted--and in fact, introverts have made important contributions to society (how many scientists and artists, etc. were introverts). This book is much appreciated, especially as this introvert goes off to business school (Cain discusses how introversion is somewhat antithetical to the business school model, despite the (quiet) success of many introverted CEOs).

0316069884|5.0|Franzen's book is vivid and contains a slew of reasons to avoid factory farm meat, poultry, and fish. It is true that the facts vary in reliability (Franzen is upfront about this; the farming/fishing industries unsurprisingly do not want to share too much about their practices and investigative work can only uncover so much that isn't merely anecdotal), and that the arguments also vary in strength, but the overall message is powerful: factory farming is bad not just for animals, but for humans.<br /><br />The book brings up questions such as:<br /><br />1) Ethical treatment of animals:<br />a) is it ethical to eat animals?<br />b) why is it only ethical to eat some animals and not others?<br />c) since humans (and other animals) are omnivores, eating animals isn't necessarily wrong; however, abusive, inhumane conditions are wrong...where do we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable conditions for farmed animals (he has a few examples of appalling cases of animal abuse, possibly brought on in part by the poor, stressful conditions of the industrialized slaughterhouse)?<br /><br />2) Societal impact/externalities (environmental and health costs to society):<br />a) Pollution<br />i) Greenhouse gases produced by the animals (they are forced to eat foods they are not adapted to eat, including but not limited to government subsidized (and thus, artificially cheap) corn, their own species, etc.) and farming techniques - these costs are not borne by the industry, but by society (global warming, etc.)<br />ii) Similarly, the animals produce vast amounts of manure that contain pollutants since they're eating food they're not adapted to eat. These wastes are rarely disposed of properly and often contain hazardous substances that increase morbidity in populations of nearby towns and seep into water supplies, which has killed off entire fish populations of nearby lakes<br />b) Rampant use of antibiotics - antibiotics, instead being used to treat illness, are used preventatively, which causes antibiotic-resistant strains of diseases, thus putting<br />c) Increased risk of pandemics: Crowded conditions and animals being fed members of their own species (and other species that may have diseases that can infect them) increase the risk of the rise of dangerous strains of diseases: avian flu, swine flu, mad cow disease, etc.<br />d) Feeding the world's population<br />i) Inefficient food energy conversion - each calorie of animal flesh requires the animal to eat many times that amount of calories (estimates vary from 4 to 75 times)<br />ii) Growing food for animals is water-intensive: \\"One pound of beef requires an input of approximately 2500 gallons of water, whereas a pound of soy requires 250 gallons of water and a pound of wheat only 25 gallons.\\" (about.com)<br />iii) We cannot support the rise in meat demand (as countries like China and India grow and their populations get richer and will consume more meat as a whole) with our current technologies<br />iv) The increase in demand in meat (and thus its production) will thus increase cost of grains, making food less affordable for the poorest (similarly for clean water)<br /><br />Other: Franzen doesn't go much into detail about dairy farming conditions.<br /><br />Bottom line is that based on the available information, factory farmed meat is inefficient, polluting, and inhumane. Personally, I believe that the broader impacts (inefficiency, pollution, antibiotic abuse, unsanitary conditions, etc.) mean that factory farming has to change--too much is at stake. The book isn't trying to convince the reader that eating meat is evil--but that we, the consumer, cannot support a system that does not pay for its negative impacts on our planet.

I found Poppy it easier to relate to Poppy than to Becky. Kinsella knows how to tell a funny, romantic story.  I've Got Your Number is a must read of you love Shopaholic or chicklit in general.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great little sharpener to throw in the tackle box or on a back pack.

0439023513|4.0|I see alot of complaints on here about the non-fairy tale ending.  But I think these readers miss the point, the final book in the hunger games trilogy is perfect in it's disappointment, in fact, it is the most brilliant of the three.  Not to give away something but this book is decidely dissatisfying and that is it's beauty. When has civil war ever been glorious? When has the victory or defeat been satisfying to it's participants.  The line of good and evil blends, right and wrong, there are casualties and in the end no one who's gone through it has ever been the same. And that is exactly how the hunger games ends, people die, life goes on and the survivors try and pick up the pieces.  No magic pill that solves the world or our individual problems.  The only thing one can do is try and survive much like the hunger games themselves.
B002BWP49C|3.0|This \\"Special Edition\\" is a waste of two discs. There are hardly any special features - just the commentary and a couple of featurettes. Oh yes, and that stupid \\"Jump to\\" Edward and Jacob feature that each movie has. I was looking forward to deleted/extended scenes and maybe some bloopers. I was extremely disappointed to find out there are none.

0062082353|5.0|One of the best accounts of an actual Navy Seal I have read.  Many are sanitized, but this book is a wonderful first person account of an incredible experience.  What Chris Kyle does in one day is more than any of us dream about.  Yet he does his best day after day as if he had a death wish.  I am amazed that anyone can be in such a mind set. To be truly the bigger nightmare is how one can survive hell holes like Fallujah and Ramadi.<br /><br />Some reviews (Pooh-Pooh) Taya's comments. I found them valid in describing the Navy Seal experience and the stress that comes with it.<br /><br />Great read, funny, inspiring and tragic. Chris tells it like it is.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|Honestly, at first, I loved the game.  it progressed quickly and seemed fairly easy to learn.  That was about 5-6 months ago.  Since then, the game has DRASTICALLY changed. Umpteen updates later and the game still has much to be desired.  Graphics are cute, but food is quickly eaten, limitations on obtaining gems, and its hard to visit all my friends, while keeping up my red star rating.<br /><br />Ive also been told that the iPad/iPod version is beautiful and has much more added features, items and quests.  I am disappointed to hear this as I use the Android version.<br /><br />Every update changes the gameplay and every other update affects the notifications.  Currently my game crashes 2-3 times an hour and I no longer receive any notifications, even though the options are all checked in my settings.<br /><br />if this were fixed, along with the oddly suspicious permissions, it would be a five star.
B00008WT5E|5.0|After the great LET THERE BE ROCK, AC DC hit the world with the POWERAGE album! What a great hard rock piece! All the songs are amazing, like the classics SIN CITY, GIMME A BULLET and RIFF RAFF and the powerful ones KICKED IN THE TEETH and WHAT´s NEXT TO THE MOON!!!! Another great album by the great BON SCOTT years!
1612130283|1.0|I usually don't read this kind of book but all the publicity got me curious. The story was interesting and erotic to a degree.<br /><br />The main character, Anastasia blushes easily, we GET IT, however I almost tossed my kindle after about the 50th time the author wrote I FLUSH! It was constant and became so annoying. Also the constant Oh my and biting of her lip.<br />If not for that I would have purchased the other two books. The only way I would do that now is if they were on the free list. I Flush!
B00008WT5C|5.0|I love all the AC DC albuns with the great vocals of Bon Scott, but i think LET THERE BE ROCK is not only the best AC DC compilation, but one of the most remarkable rock moments of all time. GO DOWN is a great rock song, but from DOG EAT DOG begins the rock magic...The classic fantastic title track LET THERE BE ROCK, BAG BOY BOOGIE, PROBLEM CHILD, the glorious one OVERDOSE, HELL AIN´T A BAD PLACE...And the AC DC masterpiece is completed by the magnificient WHOLE LOTTA ROSIE!!!!!
0385344228|3.0|I found this novel to be an interesting read, but it sure took reading quite a few pages until I felt the author had me hooked. In fact, it wasn't until the last hundred pages or so that I couldn't put it down. Landay could use a sharper editor guiding his writing. At times, especially in the first 200 pages, he seems to get a bit too enthralled with his own storytelling technique. Rather, he should focus on keeping a razor-sharp edge to his story. Maybe he'd benefit by keeping the KISS rule in mind.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|METALLICA will always be one of my favorite bands....RIDE THE LIGHTNING, MASTER OF PUPPETS, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL and THE BLACK ALBUM are METAL MASTERPIECES, and important pieces of the WORLD MUSIC history....but since the LOAD/RELOAD years, METALLICA become another creature...ST ANGER was really bad, and i thought METALLICA was kinda lost....DEARTH MAGNETIC is great, the best thing since the legendary BLACK ALBUM....and than, they recorded this LULU with Lou Reed....WHY, METALLICA????? WHY? LULU is BY FAR the worst album i ever heard in my life.....The front cover, the booklet and the lyrics are terrible and sick....and the songs...well, i can see some interesting riffs on The view or Pumping blood, but looks like Metallica and Lou Reed tried really really hard to take the songs to ways where they got any charisma or melody....actually, Lou reed don't sing here, he talk and in a TOTAL BORING way...and WHY??????WHY 2 discs??????? It's really a long journey through the worst music you can find in the world.....By now, i don't know if METALLICA will ever be something close to the MAGIC METAL BAND they were in the past....LULU is trully sad, and in a TOTAL uninspired and strange sick way....i still love METALLICA's past, but James, Lars and Kirk are trying really really hard to DESTROY METALLICA's legacy.....STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM LULU, and respect METALLICA for old classics like MASTER OF PUPPETS and RIDE THE LIGHTNING.....
B006QVRVJK|4.0|Meet the Longstreets and the Cowans, two married couples living in New York City. They are decent people (so they think), meeting in an apartment room to discuss a certain thing. Now that it is over and they seem satisfied, but what they don't know is that they are about to experience the worst of day of their life.<br /><br />The comedy opens with a long shot of schoolboys on the playground. It seems two of them get into a confrontation. Later, two pairs of parents hold a meeting to discuss the matter. They are Penelope Longstreet (Jodie Foster), Michael Longstreet (John C. Reilly), Nancy Cowan (Kate Winslet) and Alan Cowan (Christoph Waltz). When everything is done smoothly, one small thing leads to another, resulting in a mess.<br /><br />Based on a 2007 play \\"Le Dieu du Carnage\\" (\\"God of Carnage\\") by Yasmina Reza, the film is almost entirely set in a Brooklyn apartment where the Longstreets live. In this French-German-Polish-Spanish production only four characters appear (except the director who is briefly seen as a neighbor behind the door).<br /><br />As you know, the idea of \\"stage play on celluloid\\" often fails, but Polanski keeps the brisk pace throughout, creating the tension between the characters. Polanski is always good at portraying people emotionally cornered in a claustrophobic situation (as shown in a psychological thriller \\"Death and the Maiden\\"), but this time he effectively uses his technique for a more comedic purpose. It is a success though you might sometimes feel uncomfortable (even while laughing) because, after all, some aspects of \\"Carnage,\\" in an exaggerated manner, would remind us of the people we know including ourselves.<br /><br />Probably in real life, the Cowans would not stay so long in someone else's house. They would politely decline the leftover fruit cobbler offered to them and just go home. I know, but this is a dark comedy with caricatures and as such it works.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Every once in awhile (not nearly often enough), I come across a book so good that it spoils me and I have a difficult time getting into the next few books I try to read. Ready Player One is most definitely one of those. Like most gamers and children of the 80s, the premise is tailor made to appeal to me. A young geek on an epic quest within a massive virtual world filled to the brim with most of the things I've been obsessing about since I was a kid - how could it go wrong? It could have. Easily. But, thankfully, not in Cline's hands.<br /><br />Cline populates his world with a handful of interesting characters and the plot moves along at a swift clip, full of intriguing, sometimes unexpected, twists. But what I really loved about Ready Player One was the obvious effort the author took to bring his worlds (virtual and real) to life. The attention to detail doesn't border on obsessive, it hurls itself over that ledge very early on. Not to say that the book is overly descriptive. Just that it gets everything right. I'm always intrigued by stories where you can tell the author took painstaking amounts of time to delve into every interesting facet of their world. Sort of like how World War Z seemed to explore every conceivable angle of what would realistically occur during a zombie apocalypse. It's like that here. It's the little details that make this such a joy, like the Oasis's voluntary physical activity regime or the architecture of the Stacks.<br /><br />Ready Player One was one of the best stories I've read in a good while. I only have one real caveat. In a book so obsessed with the pop culture of the 80s, gaming in particular, how does our favorite mustachioed plumber get glossed over? No Mario love? Really?<br /><br />Mr. Cline, I'm very much looking forward to whatever you have in store for us next. Well done, sir.

B004SIP9U6|5.0|At first I resented that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN lost Best Picture to this film but after viewing this a couple of times I began to appreciate why SIL won this close contest. The idea that Shakespeare is a struggling writer who can't write much of anything until he falls in love with a woman he cannot have is a refreshing idea. It's hilarious at times to watch Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) early on as he struggles to create what we know to become classic works yet they have absolutely horrible titles and barely a first act in the play. What's great about this film is you get to see actors and actresses before they were very well known. Tom Wilkinson (before he was well known) is hilarious as a money lender turned to minor actor who practices his lines over and over again as an apothecary and still does a poor delivery on stage. That makes it even better as most of us know what a high quality actor he is/has become. The humorous moments in this piece are surprisingly good and still get a laugh out of me after this fourth viewing. How many straight up comedies can do that? Very few. Other amusing tidbits: some of his biggest and best lines are overheard as he's walking about in the crowds, wanna be playwrights try to get him to read their works just like in Hollywood, actors at the end of the play dreading the silence from the audience and then basking in relief as the audience erupts into applause, and people keep talking about what a timeless writer that Marlowe fellow is which just riles Shakespeare. There are several nods to Shakespeare's works, the Jacobean playwright Daniel Webster and even the Roman tragedian, Seneca. The Academy Awards nominated it for a ton of awards and it won several, including not only Best Picture but also Best Actress (Gwyneth Paltrow), Best Supporting Actress (Judi Dench) and Best Original Screenplay (Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman). Other notables in this film were Ben Affleck, Colin Firth (THE KING'S SPEECH), Geoffrey Rush and Rupert Everett. You don't have to be a lover of Shakespeare's works to enjoy this picture by the way. I certainly have found most of his works ponderous readings and tend to enjoy the summaries more than reading the plays with their many student footnotes on every page. DIALOGUE/CHARACTERS: A minus to A; STORY/PLOTTING: A minus to A; SHAKESPEARE FOCUSES/FEEL: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: October 2011 (4th viewing); OVERALL GRADE: A minus to A.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE(possible spoilers): \\"Who's that?\\" \\"Nobody.

A great light has gone out.\\"/// \\"So what's this play about then?\\"(Dude with a very minor role tries to lie and impress) \\"It's about this nurse . . . \\" /// [Saying their goodbyes]  William Shakespeare: You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.  /// [about Marlowe's death in a tavern]  Ned Alleyn: A quarrel about the bill.

Queen Elizabeth: As stories must when love's denied: with tears and a journey.  /// Queen Elizabeth: Fifty pounds! A very worthy sum on a very worthy question. Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love? I bear witness to the wager, and will be the judge of it as occasion arises. I have not seen anything to settle it yet.  /// Queen Elizabeth: And tell Master Shakespeare, something more cheerful next time, for Twelfth Night.  /// [last lines] William Shakespeare: My story starts at sea, a perilous voyage to an unknown land. A shipwreck. The wild waters roar and heave. The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces. And all the helpless souls within her drowned. All save one. A lady. Whose soul is greater than the ocean, and her spirit stronger than the sea's embrace. Not for her a watery end, but a new life beginning on a stranger shore. It will be a love story. For she will be my heroine for alltime. And her name will be Viola.  /// Philip Henslowe: You see - comedy. Love, and a bit with a dog. That's what they want.  /// Ned Alleyn: [singing the stage directions] Gentlemen upstage; ladies downstage... Are you a lady Mr. Kent?  /// William Shakespeare: Follow that boat! First Boatman: Right you are, guv'nor!... I know your face. Are you an actor? William Shakespeare: [oh God, here we go again] Yes. First Boatman: Yes, I've seen you in something. That one about a king. William Shakespeare: Really? First Boatman: I had that Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.  /// Hugh Fennyman: How much is that, Mr Frees?  Frees: Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman. Hugh Fennyman: Correct. Philip Henslowe: But I have to pay the actors and the author. Hugh Fennyman: Share of the profits.

B004W89N72|2.0|The graphics are not bad on the Kindle Fire and I like the area below the calendar to type your notes or activities, but:<br />* It cannot sync with any calendar app so you have to double entry all the data into this. What about Google calendar or Outlook? Why not sync with your computer calendar even via a cable?<br />* You can type events but there is no way to set a time and alarm.<br /><br />It asks for a lot of permissions and is designed to have internet access so why does it not sync with a calendar?<br />Permissions:<br />* Storage modify/delete<br />* Network communication - full internet<br />* System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping<br />* Network communication - view network state<br />* Hardware controls - control vibrate<br />* System tools - automatically start at boot<br /><br />It has nice graphics but limited capability. It falls short of features for a paid calendar app. It is a nice approach but some basic needs are not available. It needs enhancements to be really useful for active people with a busy schedule.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was disapointed with this book after reading the first two books in the series.<br /><br />First, the fist two books involve Katniss going to the Hunger Games, but tis one does not, which bothers me because that is really the main focus of the series.<br /><br />Also, I find parts of the book boring and/or confusing.<br /><br />Finally, I do not really like how the end turns out. I wish Katniss chose to spend her life with the other guy (not giving anyting away).<br /><br />This book was ok but I would have liked a better book to end this trilogy.
074357818X|5.0|Trisha's mom and dad are getting a divorce.  Her mom takes her and her older brother on a wilderness hiking trail but all it turns out to be is a continuous argument between her mom and brother about the divorce.  Trisha falls back to avoid hearing the continuous argument and stops to go off the trail to relieve herself.  When she starts back up on the trail she realizes the she cannot hear them anymore and gets worried.  She begins chasing after them and tries to catch them but slides down a hill and becomes totally lost.<br /><br />She realizes that she is lost in the wilderness with limited food, her Game Boy and her Walkman.  While she wanders through the woods she listens to her Walkman to see if they are looking for her and to listen to baseball games with her idol, Tom Gordon.  She is getting deeper and deeper into the woods and starts to follow a steam as she believes that is her way to civilization.  She is getting tired and exasperated at the ordeal and begins to hallucinate that people are appearing to her including Tom Gordon and some kind of beast......<br /><br />This story is wonderfully written and you can feel the emotions and fear of Trisha as she tries to find her way to help.  This is a little different style of story written by Stephen King but it is enjoyable and fun to hear.  My wife and I listened to this story on audio CD and liked it!

B000JQV68A|4.0|`Beauty will be born' as a flapper. Ushering in an era, something new and complex that people will love but will equally taint and be tainted by having existed at all.<br /><br />Essentially the story of Anthony & Gloria Patch. The prior, an intelligent, striking fellow educated at Harvard and able to woo just about any woman he'd desire. The later, a \\"vamp\\" of emotion, incredibly striking, pushy but devoted. The two are intending to live off of Anthony's inheritance once his grandfather passes but during the meantime they intend to revel as much as possible and work the opposite - so it's done.<br /><br />This is a progressive story which sees the characters initially very young, naïve and rather unshaped. However, as the story progresses and the characters develop they turn into solid figures but none-the-less shells of their former selves.<br /><br />Alcoholism and moral depravity abound as frequent drunken revels and the youthful philosophizing of life turn into hatred, squalor, carelessness, dispassion and a dropping of the youthfully optimistic veil that hides the true cruelties of life. These become increasingly more evident as Anthony drags Gloria down the socio-economic ladder and both are gradually abandoned by their `friends' as the couple tread closer to destitution.<br /><br />Passion ebbs, flows, dies, revives - thoughts disappear because thinking is frugal, this replaced by hedonism and loathing, both of the `self' and of `anyone who does anything'.<br /><br />In the end Anthony considers himself to have won the fight (or the goal to do as little as possible but `enjoy life') while positing that he was always alone and that anyone whom he'd let in had become an adversary at some point - he beat them but at what cost?

159102594X|5.0|It says a lot about a book when the number of 4- and 5-star reviews are in the vast majority. It says even more when the same applies to all the author's books. Joe Abercrombie is one of the few authors lucky to enjoy such kudos, and rightly so. My review won't make much difference to the stats, but I have enjoyed this trilogy so much that I want to put it on the record. I was a huge reader of fantasy in my childhood and early adult life, but it was gradually replaced by historical fiction, a situation that continues. However, I kept hearing Joe's name over the last couple of years, and when friends and readers kept recommending him, I was tempted to buy The Blade Itself. Boy, was I glad that I did! I swiftly moved onto Before They Are Hanged, and then Last Argument of Kings.<br /><br />*Mild spoilers ahead*<br /><br />This is fantasy at its grittiest, its bloodiest, its funniest, its darkest and its most engaging. Characters like Sand dan Glokta, the maimed, deeply sarcastic torturer, and Logen Ninefingers, the damaged warrior/berserker are creations of pure genius. The other characters who people the pages of these books are also worthy of mention: Jezal, the self-loving narcissist army officer who finds himself king; Ferro, the woman who hates everyone and everything, and West, the officer with a conscience who somehow can't help his own sister. The plotting is devious, the action relentless, the intrigue skilfully wrought. I also think that the books' central premise that almost no one has any real say in what goes on has deep resonance with real life. Sad, ironic, but true.<br /><br />Quite simply, this trio of books is first class. Top notch. Outstanding. They have converted me back to fantasy, which is something I did not think would ever happen. Bravo, Joe Abercrombie!<br /><br />By the way, don't expect a happy ending - you'll be sadly disappointed!<br /><br />Ben Kane, author of The Forgotten Legion.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|This is an engaging version of a classic game, but the artwork is rather low textured on my HTC Evo 3d. The story mode is a comicbook styled mode that alternates story and gameplay, but the artwork and text is so low textured it can be hard to follow. The game also sports vertical letterbox that shrinks the game space and a crowded interface for a rough game. I might enjoy the gameplay, but it is an ugly enough game I don't see myself playing often

B0064NTZJO|4.0|Drive was one of my favorite films of 2011 and I saw it in the theater 3 times and still bought the bluray. Great movie and looks gorgeous. I would have given 5 stars if not for the UltraViolet service.<br /><br />One of the reasons I got the bluray was it claimed to have a digital download included. This was the new UltraViolet download service. This is the absolute worst download service I have ever used, bar none. They want you to register for 3 different services just to get access to the download which never happens. I have sent many messages to customer support with no response besides the automated one. It is as if they would rather you bit torrent it, a much better service. This is not how you treat a customer who legally buys the movie. UltraViolet is a lie and any company that uses it does not care about it's customers.<br /><br />Still, the movie is great. If you don't need the download it is a great addition to a movie fans collection.
1609611543|5.0|I started low-glycemic (reducing wheat/grains) eating in the Fall of 2009 and gradually changed to grain free eating, following the advice of Dr. Davis in his TrackYourPlaque program.  I wasn't 'fat' before I started low glycemic dieting however my slacks went from size 36 to size 34 by just cutting down high glycemic foods; after eliminating all grains I now wear either a waist size 33 (or 32 depending on the cut) slacks and weigh the same as when I graduated college. Overall I've lost about 15 lbs. I eat as much as I want as often as I want; I don't feel like I'm on a diet. All I do is eat foods permitted by this diet and if I cheat I try to cheat in a way that will reduce a glycemic spike (eat protein first then cheat; dip bread in olive oil rather than just eating bread).<br /><br />My cholesterol has always been low (about 140) without meds, however with this diet my LDL (the bad cholesterol) has gone down and my HDL (good) cholesterol has gone up. My VLDL profile (fractionation of what types of LDL are in my blood) changed from profile B to A (a good thing).<br /><br />Choose this diet to feel great, look great and to fix/reduce the chance that you will be plagued by an autoimmune disease such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, arthritis...

006197806X|4.0|Lauren Oliver is currently one of my favorite authors. Her descriptions, characters, events, ect. are always worth reading no matter what part of the book you're on. That in mind, I have to admit that Pandemonium had some huge expectations on my part. Delirium was fantastic for me, and after I finished reading it I thought that was it. I wasn't planning for a sequel. And for as many expectations I put into this sequel that did not quite make their mark, I almost wish this book hadn't been written. Almost. However this is all just my opinion...blah, blah, blah...moving on.<br /><br />I MISSED THE OLD CHARACTERS! I know it wasn't possible to bring them back in this book, but the ones like Raven, Julian, and the \\"new Lena\\" just didn't cut it for me. They were forced. Everything was forced: the relationship with Julian, the deaths of those girls-were we supposed to cry for them because I'm sorry but I didn't know them enough to squeeze it out of me-, and the danger of fleeing through the wilds in the THEN-of course some of the characters are going to be fine, in the next chapter there's a NOW with them in it. All I'm saying is who are these characters Oliver introduced us to? We learn a lot more about Lena, and we learn about Julian, but when Lena felt so betrayed by Tack and Raven, all I could think of is why? I get no sense of family from the people in the wilds she lived with, yet family is what she calls them.<br /><br />Onto Julian. I'm not even sure how to comment on him. He and Lena had some really tender moments, but I am now and forever will be an Alex fan. Julian seemed girlish to me. This is the reason why: he is the \\"old Lena,\\" the one ready for being cured, and Lena is Alex, the one who knows the wilds and attacks huge bodyguards with only a knife. They fell in love too quickly despite Lena repeating over and over again her remorse of Alex. Julian earned my sympathies-probably the only character who did. I felt little more for him than honest sorrow.<br /><br />You might be wondering at this point: why on earth did this picky, unfeeling person give Pandemonium four stars if she keeps rambling on about all the dislikes. I will tell you why: because I can't write a review long enough to cover all the things I did like. I really can't, and many other readers will figure those like's out without me trying to describe them. I just had to let the things I disliked out. I desperately await the next book, but I hope now, with my expectations squashed to less than galaxy heights, I can appreciate it like Oliver's books should be. Oh, and if you haven't noticed the reviews screaming \\"I can't believe the ending!\\" then let me also add, \\"I REALLY can't believe the ending!\\" I think I passed out after reading that last page. It was that shocking. SO DON'T YOU DARE SKIP TO THE END!br />You might be wondering at this point: why on earth did this picky, unfeeling person give Pandemonium four stars if she keeps rambling on about all the dislikes.

I am, however, rather disappointed in the fact that I can't even highlight verses without a wifi connection.

0316017930|1.0|Victimology doesn't work.<br /><br />I read Malcolm Gladwell's book\\"Outliers\\" while in the poorest part of the poorest country on earth. Gladwell's theory of success will not help Africa, or you in the developed world either. It's actually dangerous to those who CHOOSE to live a life of significance.<br /><br />  \\"Circumstances don't make me who I am. How I respond to them does.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell disagrees. He says circumstances are largely to blame (or credit) for who I am.<br /><br />Never has a book engendered such a reaction from me to make me review it. I don't review books. I use them to change who I am, or discard them as interesting (entertaining, but not transformational) or not interesting. I loved Gladwell's Tipping Point and use it regularly in my work and life.<br /><br />But Outliers is not just \\"interesting\\". For those who choose to embrace it, it could be a transformational compendium of victimology that gives excuse after excuse for not choosing to live a life of significance. It's poisonous to choice.<br /><br />If it was by an obscure author it could be ignored. But because Gladwell has laid such a great foundational reputation with his other works, people have bought into this without critiquing it. Many people loved it and recommended it to me, which is how I read all my books. I was very disappointed by what I read. I hope you are, too.<br /><br />Which 90/10 Rule Do You Live By?<br />My belief is that 90% of life is what you make happen and 10% is what happens to you. And you have two possible responses to the 10%:<br />1) Fascinating! How'd that happen? Let's make lemonade! and<br />2) I'm a victim of my circumstances, background, legacy, great grandmother, the Duke of Wellington, Atilla the Hun or some outside dark force that rules over me.<br /><br />Gladwell apparently believes 90% of life is what happens to you and 10% is what you make happen. And for the 90% that happens to you, he subscribes to ONLY response #2 - you're a victim. Poor babies. You should lay down and die. Give up. It's understandable. You had an ancestor 300 years ago that made a bad decision or was unlucky, or you were living in poverty, and you're never going to live it down.<br /><br />And if you're successful, Gladwell says you also didn't have nearly as much to do with it as you think. It's luck, circumstance, legacy, the Duke of Wellington, Attila the Hun and a thousand other things outside you that nearly pushed you unwillingly over the edge of success. You nearly had no choice but to live the life of Riley.<br /><br />I say CHOICE is 90% of the formula for success. Gladwell says CIRCUMSTANCE is...50%? 90%?. I believe a difficult background makes you even more successful if you CHOOSE to respond to it well. You'll be stronger than most. Gladwell says hardship makes it very unlikely you can succeed - it's almost not your choice at all. In Gladwell's world, hardship and a lousy background aren't sources of fertile ground for building a unique and wonderfully powerfully story for you. There something to run away from and get over, if you can. Good luck with that.<br /><br />Disraeli said there are three kinds of lies: \\"Lies, damnable lies, and statistics.\\" Here are some of Gladwells:<br /><br />1) He cites Roseto, PA as \\"proof\\" that where you are FROM has more to do with success (health, lower crime, suicide, etc.) than your choices. Then he summarily ignores the research that shows the reason the town was so healthy was EXACTLY because of their 1) choice to live in close knit relationships, 2) choice to be spiritual, 3) choice to live by fundamentally sound values, 4) choice to respect elders, etc. Even the town they came FROM in Italy and others from that town that didn't CHOOSE to live like the Rosetans didn't have the same health and crime. The Rosetan's CHOICES made them who they were, not where they are from. This is terrible correlation of cause and effect.<br /><br />2) He cites Canadian Junior Hockey stats showing 40% of the 10 yr. old all-stars were born Jan-Mar, 30% April-June, and only 10% Oct.-Dec. The age cutoff is Jan 1 so those kids born early in the year are playing against younger kids and get chosen to go through to the all-stars, even though they're not better, just older (therefore appear better when chosen as all-stars). He wants a separate league for the poor babies born June-Dec. Get over it.<br /><br />I won the city batting championship three years in a row in Pony League w/ a left-handed batting average of .555 and an on-base % of .695. I could draw a walk as easy as getting a hit. As the smallest youngest tenth grader, I tried out for the high school baseball team. The uninformed coach lined us up by height and cut the bottom five without even looking at us. He was looking for football players for the fall. I was easily the fastest center fielder and the best hitter there (and a prized left-hander), and five years later when I filled out to 6' 1\\"+ it turns out I might have been a pro prospect. Wah, wah, wah. Life is not fair. Michael Jordan was cut from ninth grade basketball. He CHOSE to not give up. I CHOSE to give up and do something else. It's about choice.<br /><br />Apparently pro hockey players agree. The 40% born in Jan-Mar in kid hockey is reduced to 31% in the pros, and the 10% Oct-Dec. is doubled to 20%, just five percentage points below \\"fair\\". An awful lot of those poor babies who didn't make the All Star teams first time around CHOSE to not give up. Life isn't fair, nor should it be. We would lose all our drive to succeed. Gladwell didn't show us the pro stats. Because they demonstrate that circumstances don't make me who I am. How I respond, does. Choice.<br /><br />3) To debunk the ridiculously over-worked role of talent, Gladwell says it takes 10,000 hours to succeed - that at the highest level, work is more important than talent. I couldn't agree more, except that having correctly correlated success more with hard work (choice) than with talent, this debunks most of the rest of his victimology as well. I have a choice to succeed. Working my tail off is the biggest part of that, and that is a choice. This book misses cause and effect more than any book I've read recently.<br /><br />4) He also correctly debunks the role of \\"genius\\" by showing many smart people don't make it. I couldn't agree more, but the reason isn't because of their background. It's because of their choices. He actually gives the smartest man in the world a pass for giving up on getting published because his background obviously was too difficult to over come. Poor baby. It took me 19 years to finish college, but I've started and run seven businesses. I'm not smart, I'm just relentless. Choice.<br /><br />Gladwell applies equally tortured cause and effect to things like legacy, heritage, deep ties to people you never met in the old country a hundred years ago that allow you to live a life of significance or keep you from experiencing it. But he gives almost no time to the most important characteristics of success; personal vision, personal choice, and personal commitment to get there no matter what. Burn the bridges, sink the ships, shred the parachutes, I'm all in. These ideas are nothing more than background noise in the book, which he only recognizes as an annoying fact but not as the source of success. He misses the most important cause and effect relationships that create success.<br /><br />My best lesson from all of college came from one of the Women's Studies Courses I took. The female professor asked the one other guy in the 200 person class to come up front, gave him a toy gun and told him to hold her up. At first it was comical, but she kept belittling him and instructing him until he held the gun to her head and screamed at her, \\"Give me your f-ing money or I'll blow your f-ing head off!\\" She congratulated him for eventually becoming convincing, and ask him to sit down.<br /><br />Then she asked us a stunningly simple question, \\"At what point did I become a victim?\\" Her answer - \\"I never was.\\" And she said, \\"And at what point would I have become a victim? Only when I gave him control of my mind or he took control of me physically.\\"<br /><br />She went on to say that the problem with victimology is that it gives us a pass from taking charge of our lives, and allows us to blame our circumstances for forming who we are. I never forgot that lesson from 30 years ago. Those who read Gladwell's book should use it as a filter as they read.<br /><br />I road on the back of a motorcycle through the bush for 8 hrs in the middle of the rainy night, then spent 10 hrs with the Chief, and 10 hrs back last night without sleep (four flats, a blown gear box). My African friends on that trip were incredibly resilient. There wasn't a victim among them. Together we plan to build a first world country on the backs of these incredible people.

0440245931|3.0|Let me start off by saying this: The Pelican Brief is not necessarily a bad book. It is not necessarily a bad book until you bother trying to compare it with other Grisham books.<br /><br />Why, then, was it so disappointing? After \\"The Firm,\\" I was ecstatic about trying to read another book of John Grisham's. \\"The Pelican Brief\\" was there so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />It was disappointing.<br /><br />While I felt Mitch was a decently realistic character (in fact, a pretty interesting one at that), Darby was not appealing to me. Nor were any of the characters in \\"The Pelican Brief.\\" Often, I felt that the story moved so quickly that it took too long to process. The plot was unrealistic at best--in real life, there was no way Darby would survive. Mitch I could believe, Darby I could not. At times, I felt bored with Grisham's writing. I also personally wondered--how long could a person hold up under that psychologically? Perhaps the same is true of Mitch, but I felt that Darby would've broken down long before the ending.<br /><br />I also felt extremely discouraged by how the criminals chose to attack Darby for a brief that had little to no evidence. These people were people that knew how to make their way around the business world and knew that murders would only add weight to Darby's argument. They would most likely have waited in the shadows for solid evidence--and as there was originally none, the brief would've been tossed aside as a theory without any weight.<br /><br />I was highly disappointed by the ending. I didn't love the teacher-student relationship in the beginning but ok. People will love who they choose to love. I, however, felt extremely disappointed by how quickly Darby decided that she cared for Gray instead.<br /><br />The characters were a disappointment in the start. They never managed to redeem themselves in the finish.<br /><br />Overall, I was disappointed. Grisham should've thought this through a little more.

B0067QPVD2|1.0|In Antarctica, a small group of total half-wits encounter a dangerous alien and then behave more moronically than seems humanly possible.  Films like this arise when very stupid directors (in this case Matthijs van Heijningen Jr.)  and equally stupid writers (Eric Heisserer) are hired by soulless, crappy Producers (Marc Abraham) to remake older movies that they are too talentless to conceive of themselves, but wish to take credit for.  The problem with this modern film making paradigm is that the new script and resulting story can never be smarter than the three idiots in charge (see above).

B0071MV540|3.0|So I was searching for a comedy. Something that would make me laugh to end my Friday evening. Ben Stiller + Eddie Murphy...come on right. So the movie was funny at some parts, the ones already seen in the previews, but the plot was better with a few unexpected twists here and there. This movie really kept me guessing throughout

1453624910|1.0|As many others, I was extraordinarily excited for the release of Glimpses. I lost count of how many times I've read Luck in the Shadows, and I still tear up if I think about poor Nysander too hard. I certainly never expected my favorite fictional characters to be the subjects of such poor prose, and by their original creator, no less. Not only did the \\"glimpses\\" lack any emotion or depth whatsoever, they were riddled with more spelling and grammatical errors than a 4th grader's diary. There is absolutely no excuse for this with such easy access to spell-check and an editor.<br /><br />Sadly, I wish I had never glimpsed \\"Glimpses.\\" Perhaps the end result would deserve more than one star had it not been so obviously rushed.
B003UBTX72|3.0|If you are a guitar player, then this book is more for you.  Details of keys, guitars and producers are not for everyone.  His insight is often self indulgent, although he goes to the trouble to make it not seem that way.  Vince Neil's book, or Open are much more honest books.
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|The Stranger is a thought-provoking story that highlights some of the facets of \\"Existentialism\\" as viewed through the behavior of some of the characters.

It does not have irritating banners in places you tap accidentally which I really appreciate on a free app. I tried a few other apps to use and this one is my fav so far. It is good for quick reminders and grocery list so many app features are in one place, so u don't need so many apps installed and stores nicely on sd card. I highly recommend this app.Thanks to whomever it was that created evernote app. I appreciate it!

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Although I would say most all of Forever Girl would be considered Young Adult, there is a scene near the end that may be a little unsuitable for younger readers, so be forewarned :)<br /><br />What is Forever Girl, you ask? Forever Girl is an exceptionally written paranormal romance by Rebecca Hamilton. Everything about this book intrigued me. Witches, vampires, strigoi, shapeshifters. A little something for everyone.<br /><br />Hamilton's writing style is addictive. The scenes in the story quite literally jumped out of the pages. There were various points in the book where my heart did beat a little faster with anticipation. Hamilton has a way of drawing out a suspenseful scene where there is just no way that anyone can stop reading. Not only are her suspense writing skills top notch, but her romance scenes were equally well written.  I pretty much found myself needing to keep reading this book so that I could find out the answers to the little questions floating around in my head!<br /><br />Not only does Hamilton introduce us to a strong and clever leading lady, Sophia Parson, but she also gives us ...Charles *sigh* Charles just oozes sex appeal. The chemistry between Sophia and Charles is just as addictive as the story itself! Not only is this a truly romantic story, but it is also packed with a lot of action. Fast paced action in a world of vampires made Forever Girl impossible to put down. Add in a cast of supporting characters, both good and bad, that readers will fall in love with, and you've got a recipe for an unforgettable paranormal romance that will leave readers yearning for more.

1612130283|1.0|I heard about this book on the Today Show, that book clubs were enjoying it and that it was quite racy.  Excellent, I thought.  Sophisticated erotica.  Given the book's success, thousands of other women must have felt the same.  Sadly, the writing is so juvenile, I gave up before anything \\"erotic\\" made an appearance.  Both central characters are stock, uninteresting, unappealing.  The man is handsome, rich, and has great hair.  That's about it for him.  The woman, girl really, has the vocabulary (\\"Damn\\" and \\"Double crap\\" are typical) and the maturity of a 12 year old.  If this is a book club choice, then book clubs have slipped considerably.  My book club would laugh me out of the room.  A complete waste of money and time.
0756405890|3.0|This is the first book in a projected high-fantasy trilogy about living-legend hero named Kvothe in a faux-medieval world threatened by an evil fallen-hero-turned-demon and his vicious man-eating-spider-automaton minions. It started strong, if you like that genre, but was ultimately a failure and annoying.<br /><br />(I tend to find grand-scale, heroic, dragon-slaying fantasy-fantasy annoying, though.)<br /><br />The really annoying part was that it was a bait and switch. The book starts with the retired hero facing a new, very scary peril, and then moves into memoir mode, with the hero reluctantly telling his life story to a scribe who has tracked him down. I started to realize, 3/4 of the way through, as the page-count started dwindling, that the new peril wasn't going to be addressed *in this volume*. The whole book was back-story and didn't have enough of an arc on its own. It's also a bait and switch because the hero is an adult, but the whole book concerns his time at university as a very young, precocious (15-year-old) student. If not for the framing device, this would be a teen book.<br /><br />There's been a trend in fantasy literature lately to darken things up, make the heroes realistic, introduce sex, gritty violence and the seedy side of faux-medieval life. (See Richard Morgan's The Steel Remains, for a great example of deliberate genre busting. I like that approach. Name of the Wind is the opposite. It's squeaky clean, the good guys are all good, the bad guys are all bad, it's about as sexual as Tolkein, and the writing has some style, but in the overwrought moonlight and moonbeams and whirling capes way.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Sounding raw and heavily churning and aggressively paced, the granular tone that Eddie Van Halen wrung out of his rhythm guitar phrasing (along with the manner in which he tuned it) combined the intensity of heavy metal with relatively upbeat power chords to form tremendous hooks that made tracks from Van Halen's eponymous debut flow with an almost organic groove. The chunky distortion set off the eruptive abandonment with which he worked the fretboard; it was almost impossibly fast, yet positively vibrated with exuberance, and listening to it as an 11 year-old directly after its release in 1978, I was blown away by the amount of energy he brought to bear on just chord progression and lead breaks.<br /><br />And of course it helped to play out in front of a rhythm section so heavily syncopated from years of playing prior to the release of \\"I\\" that drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony might as well have been sharing a telepathic link. Alex's percussion work could be savage, muscular, and dynamic or crisp, finessed, and restrained depending upon what sort of magnitude a particular track required, while Anthony kept things anchored down with a heavy resonance prominent in his complementary basswork, there to help cement the groove, but not overshadow Eddie's frenetic leads. His expressive tenor voice helped to produce clean, harmonious background vocals, serving as a counterpoint to David Lee Roth's baritone lead vocals; though Roth had a limited range, he still possessed a naturally charismatic vocal presence with a real sense of swagger, delivering lyrics in a seductive growl, augmenting them with a howling, banshee-like wail. He might have been the band's weakest musical link, but he was the other half of the fuse that lit their explosive sound.<br /><br />\\"Van Halen\\" tops my list of desert island discs. This release made a heavy imprint on me just as I was reaching adolescence, hitting with a real sense of vitality, enthusiasm, and force. I get upsetwhen I hear snotty elitist critics describe Eddie Van Halen as a \\"soulless technician\\" ; sure, he had technique, and boy howdy, did he ever show it off, but on this release I hear someone who's playing with unrestrained passion. \\"Ain't Talking' 'Bout Love\\" , \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\", \\" Ice Cream Man\\", \\"Running With The Devil\\", and \\"You Really Got Me\\" exude a level of intensity that few other guitarists could or would match on their debut recordings while simultaneously using a novel approach toward technique to craft a sound almost entirely new, forever identifiable as being his very own, and introducing hooks normally associated with poppy, upbeat music into the genre of hard rock/heavy metal, altering the landscape of the genre's sound while spawning a host of imitators. I submit to you that this was one of the most influential debuts of any decade, loaded with not one track that could remotely be considered as filler, and sounds as tasty and fresh on its thousandth listen as it does on its first.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Many thanks to the author, Rebecca Hamilton, for gifting me The Forever Girl(Book 1)! I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and I look forward to Book 2 and beyond.<br />I found several of the ideas presented to be very interesting. The concept of what a \\"forever girl\\" is (read it to find out, no spoilers here!) and how the author tied the past and present together was excellent. I'm also very intrigued by supernatural creatures being \\"elementals\\", and I'm looking forward to finding out more about them in the next books.<br />The writing style of the author is pleasant to read and the story goes along at a good pace.<br />I definitely recommend this book to people who like supernatural fiction, anyone who is interested in Wiccan practices, and fans of vampires!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|very cool, very addicting game. I like the expansions and customizations. The only cons: it plays in real time and food takes a while to cook, and gems are quite pricey. but once you get into it, you won't want to stop playing.

B000NTPDSW|1.0|So, I love Amazon.  I'm a Prime member, and happy to pay for it.  I've spent hundreds already this year.<br /><br />Anyway, this is my first truly bad experience with Amazon.  I ordered this item [[ASIN:B000NTPDSW The Godfather Collection (The Coppola Restoration) [Blu-ray]]] as a Deal of the Day on Feb 21.  You'd think, being a deal of the day, they'd actually have some in stock.  Nope.  I'm told I'll get the item sometime in mid March.<br /><br />I leave a comment about it, and I get an apology and I'm told they'll rush my order.  This moves the expected delivery up ONE WHOLE DAY.  Not a big deal in the end, since I've now received the item.  Fair enough, right?<br /><br />Nope again!!!  I open the item (it's mine now, isn't it?), pop it in the PS3, and we've got us a nice enough looking picture, but it's 4:3 (or thereabouts).  Certainly not the advertised 2.35:1, or the suspected actual 1.85:1 or 16:9 that others are reporting.  No, this has thick black bars on either side, and no, it's not my PS3, because everything else fills my screen.  My TV auto-detects the resolution of the input, and when the disk plays, it tells me it's changing from 1080i to 480i.<br /><br />Not pleased at all.  We'll see if they let me return it.<br /><br />Edit:  2nd set has arrived, and the same issue is present.  The product page now reads,<br /><br />\\"Item Under Review<br /><br />While this item is available from other marketplace sellers on this page, it is not currently offered by Amazon.com because customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it's described here. (Thanks for the tip!)<br /><br />We're working to fix the problem as quickly as possible.\\"<br /><br />Not sure how that helps me though.
1594203334|5.0|I read an article by Pamela Druckerman the other day and just loved what she had to say. I was most excited to see that she also had a book that expounded on the ideas in the article. I was even more pleased when Penguin Press gave me the opportunity to review it for them through NetGalley.<br /><br />Druckerman is an American living in Paris with her British husband and their three kids. Bringing Up Bebe is the capturing of her experience as a mother in the midst of this culture. In my experience, the French are very mysterious, not prone to giving out the secrets of their lives or becoming best of friends with Americans. Druckerman makes this point several times within Bringing Up Bebe.  One of the reasons that I really enjoyed this book because it was such a great commentary of the reality of France and an in depth look at the ways that Americans differ in regards to parenting.<br /><br />The structure of French parenting is very tempting. The idea of how to encourage your children to not only sleep through the night, but also allow you to spend time with your spouse. These things seem like a dream from my past when Hannah was younger. The fortunate thing is that it's not too late. We have instituted some of these ideas within our own family and they do work. The key is being consistent. As well as making sure that I think before I speak. But aren't these the things we desire of ourselves as parents already?<br /><br />Bringing Up Bebe is a wonderful reminder of what we can accomplish if we stand firm in our desires as parents. But it's also a great trip into French culture. It was almost like a mini-vacation to Paris for me, seeing the sights, interacting with the Parisians. It was wonderful. I enjoyed every second of this book and I do believe it has encouraged me to be not only a better mother but a much better wife.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|I'm really happy with this product.  I bought it to finish my HP DVD collection.<br />It came very fast (I ordered it on Friday, it arrived on Monday)and everything looked good.  It comes in a really cool holographic case that shows Harry and Dumbledore in one image and Draco and Snape in the other.  I haven't watched it yet but I can't wait to see all the bonus material.
B007H51DQG|4.0|Since i have caught up as to what has been happening on The Walking Dead s2. I have found that is has slowed down. The death of Dayle was a shocker. Even little Samone*(i think thats how you spell it) has been written off. This show needs to get back on the road and head for Fort Benning. And get back on track. Though the stay on the farm is a bit of a welcome I'am suprised no Walkers have arrived. This is a good show. Those hacks should let the creators and produce's do their thing and get off their backs. Let them do this the right way. So many good TV shows fail because of those who \\"Think\\" it should be done a certain way. Look at the Big Bang Theory this season is slipping into boredom.<br />  There are just so few show's i watch and this is one of them. Dont kill off anymore main chacters(i know missed spelled) let them work their magic. Besides I would like to see how this version of the \\"Zombie Virus\\" was created and spread. I'am a big fan of these type of Show's and Movies'. So in closeing pleas let them do their job and dont screw this show up.
B000062TU1|5.0|I bought this to finish my HP DVD collection and  am very happy with it.  I love the book style case and cover.  I miss cases like this.  There's really nothing special about the outer cover, it's just a copy of the movie cover but it's still really cool.  I love all the bonus features that take you into the world of Harry Potter.
B002W1HBN4|5.0|This truly is a MUST HAVE for all WHITNEY HOUSTON fans! This is CD/DVD collection. This is honestly hours of pure entertainment. There are 15 songs on the CD and 41 minutes of Whitney on the DVD. This was produced in 2010. I love the collection of songs.<br /><br />I do not regret this purchase! It was well worth the money!
B00005JMAH|3.0|I'm a little disappointed with the casing for this DVD, there's a disc on the inside front cover and inside back cover with nothing else.  It seems a little cheep to me for a special edition case.  There's nothing wrong with the movie and it does come with a pamphlet but overall it seems a bit cramped since the first disc ends up behind the booklet slot.

B00004ST9Q|5.0|This is an EXCELLENT DVD of a collection of 23 Whitney Houstin hits! This was made in 2000.<br /><br />This DVD also includes Whitney's 1985 Merv Griffin Show TV debut; live performances from around the world such as A New South Africa & Manheim Germany; behind the scene footage from the GREATEST HITS photo shoot; interviews with Clive Davis and much more.<br /><br />This is not a short DVD by any means. You will be entertained for quite some time!
B005I4JG80|4.0|Many critics complain about her generalization about American or French parenting, and her use of anecdotal evidence for or against the two different parenting styles -- I couldn't care less.<br /><br />I, for one, am unlikely to raise 3 kids in Paris, and any interesting ideas from France -- or anywhere really on the matter for that matter -- provide great insights. The idea that parents have a right to sanity has already contributed a great deal to my quality of life raising an active 2 years-old. I stop rushing to her care or feeling obligated for her entertainment the minute she yells. And what do you know, you can reason with a toddler if you care to try.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|This is a great Christmas CD of Whitney's! Her daughter sings on one of the songs as a special guest and did an awesome job. Whitney will be missed but she left us with amazing voice collected on CDs and videos.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|It is nice to finally watch a GREAT movie.  This film was well-acted, touching, and inspiring.  This is a must-see movie that everyone will enjoy (probably more of a chick flick, but it's a terrific story).

B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Not a bad CD but not my preference in music.  I was trying to buy \\"Lux Aeterna\\", the same one that was used in the movie \\"2001\\", but I got instead a piece of the same name but by a totally different composer.  Interesting piece but not really what I wanted.  Not the seller's fault, only mine.  I should have researched the composer's name (of the piece I actually wanted) which was Gyorgy Ligeti, but I didn't.  Turns out the woods are seemingly full of pieces by that same name... The CD arrived as advertised, in good condition.  BTW the 5 star rating is for the seller's performance, not what I'd rate the CD as, musically, even though a lot of others seem to like it a lot, I found.  If you like that composer's work don't let me put you off!

B004M3GDI4|5.0|I have owned this light for 10 months as of writing this review.<br />  I first bought this light to go in my backpack for fishing. I live in Hawaii and do a lot of shore fishing which often requires fairly treacherous hikes across lava fields in the dark. I will admit, for this purpose, I was not impressed. The light just was not bright enough to illuminate the jagged terrain, however it worked fine for up close tackle work. Unhappy with it,I threw it in my tool bag (I have a handyman business) and bought a Princeton Tech Apex 200 for my backpack (an incredible light for hiking etc.).<br />  Soon after banishing the Petzel to my tool bag, I began to use it for work, and that is where it truly shined (pardon the pun). I do a lot of work in dark confined places, and this light puts off the perfect amount of illumination in the right spectrum to see clearly without distorting colors (very important when dealing with wiring). The Pixa 3 is incredibly durable as well. I have dropped it from heights up to 8ft. and it doesn't phase it. One of my favorite features is the way the light rotates the lens against the base to protect it when being stored, and it locks the power knob so the light cant be accidentally turned on. I can just toss it in my bag and not have to worry about it being damaged by other tools. Battery life is terrific and it gives you ample warning that the batteries need to be recharged/replaced. Also, its waterproof. I've dropped it in a pail of water and I just shook it off and it kept working fine.<br />  Conclusions: If you are looking for a light for hiking, biking or outdoor activities there are much better choices. I highly recommend the Princeton Tech Apex 200.<br />  If you are looking for a top of the line work/service light, I don't think you could find a better light than this.
B005HSL626|4.0|Compared to the paid version of Fruit Ninja, I found no differences in game play or rewards. The ads on the game do not pop up as often as many may think, especially when outside of Wi-Fi range where there is no source for the ads to come from. Aside that, the game has bright, vibrant colours. The swords are unique, each with its own design and way of unlocking, as are the backgrounds. They are simple, and not too distracting from your game. This game is entertaining and fun enough to be played for long periods at a time. Just be careful of finger cramps.
B0007TKNII|3.0|If you past the chandiler falling at the wrong time and a few other inconsistencies then the movie is actually quite good. the sets are fabulous, as are the costumes, the music is strong and the singing is clear. The major problem is the Phantom,it completly misses the the point, the musical is named 'the phantom of the Opera' so why did ever cast an actor to play the role and not a singer. Don't get me wrong I like Butler, Ive seen some of his movies and he acts well, but he can't sing. the Phantom is a very challenging part and his voice was not up to it. we are supposed to fall in love with the voice of the phantom, because thats how he shows us his amazing soul. Butler is adequate as a singer, but (like most people) completley inadequate singing opera type songs.<br />The other two singers who played Raoul and Christine could have been stronger too. there chemistry was good but the singing could have been better. You would have thought that after all the musical being on the west end all this time they could have found more suitable lead roles.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Most people would be tired of the wait for a YouTube downloader to finish their videos so they can view them already. With the FREEdi YouTube Downloader, it's fast and simple. Just search for the name of the video you want, hit search, and download. The quality of the video is fantastic as long as the Wi-Fi signal is strong. The audio does not change at all from the video source, and it stays in time with the video just as on the site itself. One can decide to only download the audio of the video also, which is useful if you do not want too much space taken up on your mobile device.

B000GCFY0I|4.0|I got this book because I heard it was somewhat similar to The Hunger Games which I liked. I did like this book overall because I thought it had great plot points and the 'underlying' lessons were very real to today society. It really makes you wonder if it is something that could happen 300 years from now with advancements & the way the described the falling of our current world could be a very real thing with the wars, crimes, & trying to scientifically engineer EVERYTHING.<br /><br />I would have rated it 5/5 but some of the plot points were very unneccesary such as the whole \\"you stole my boyfriend\\" thing. While reading it I literally thought \\"Really?! PULEASE!!!\\" Although it is something that happens in high schools and even middle schools, & this is a young adult book, it seemed VERY childish with, actually, a very mature storyline. (but that just my opinion)
B001AEF6BI|5.0|I recently saw the breakfast club and absolutely loved it. It now ranks number 5 on my top 10 favorite films. It's a true classic! So I just had to buy it! So I browsed around and I found this flashback edition. It seemed well priced and had some interesting special features so I made my purchase. I was completely satisfied! The price was great and it came 2 days later. The audio and picture quality are great! The special features were super cool! And the box was in great condition! The menu was also pretty sweet! I love this DVD! I highly recommend it!

1250004217|5.0|This is one of the toughest stories I have ever read.  I can only adequately review it by retelling it all, but I can't do that.  So, consider the following inadequate:<br /><br />The story is a combination of historical and realistic fiction.  The history part recalls in horrific detail the French \\"solution\\" to the Jewish \\"problem\\" in 1942-1944, but this story pinpoints a day and days in 1942 when thousands of Jewish children (and one in particular) were rounded up to eventually be sent to the German death camp at Auschwitz.<br /><br />The author, Tatiana de Rosnay, keeps one's heart pounding and eyes wet with all the twists and turns of the story.  (What a magnificent writer.)  Actually, there are two stories being told side-by-side.  One set in 1942; another in 2002.  The two times are skillfully and intensely braided:  In a sense horrifying; in another, with a suspense that makes the reader rush through the book because one HAS to know what happens next.<br /><br />At the end, especially, one's emotions are devastated, yet also calmed--after a heart-wrenching<br />cry.<br /><br />Historical Novel (WWII):  Grade 10 thru adult<br /><br />[[ASIN:1604945486 The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)]]

0545265355|5.0|I was skeptical about this series because it is under the genre science fiction, and I don't usually get into books that fall into this category. But everyone kept telling me I had to read the books, and I'm glad I listened. It took me four days to read the entire series, I couldn't put it down. I'm also looking forward to rereading the series, which for me is unheard of. I rarely read a book twice. If you are only considering reading them, just do it!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|*Contains spoilers*  It took me a while to figure out my main problem with this book. I think that I am mostly bothered because I ended up having an intense dislike for Katniss.  She has no redeeming qualities in this 3rd book; selfish, cruel, and spends most of the book in some sort of mental breakdown.  She never achieves the potential that was always hinted at and the relationships between her and the \\"people she cares about\\" just seem really false.  I kept waiting for conversation scenes and relationship development (not necessarily romance development), but they never came.  Just scenes and scenes of propaganda filming, huddling in closets, analyzing pod traps, etc.  And Katniss voting to continue the hunger games?  That was irredeemable in the face of how in the beginning how she was so protective of children in the first books and now is apparently just as cruel and vengeful as the Capitol people.  What, now instead of protecting people (like Prim, Roe, the poor sick and injured people in the hospital in district 8) she is going to watch children kill each other and be tortured in the arena for revenge?  They destroy the only \\"good\\" characters (either by torture or death; cue Peeta and Finnick) and leave me with a sour taste in my mouth, preaching about how awful war is (and yes, that's true, but does the author think we are all so stupid that we can't figure out that fact without driving it home over and over again?)  Gale's character and actions are frequently attacked without giving a fair and opposing viewpoint.  So unsatisfying.  The first book that I have actually deleted from my Kindle.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|Been a Beatles, and thus McCartney fan since the '60s. Enjoyed his post-split \\"solo\\" albums, still listen to and enjoy Ram.<br /><br />I'm happy for Paul if he enjoyed putting this together, and I'm sure some will love it.<br /><br />For me this is just not an enjoyable listening experience; doesn't bring anything to the table as a cover album must to be relevant.<br /><br />I get why he would want to record these standards; I grew up listening to them, too, and value their place.<br /><br />Comparisons to Linda Ronstadt's and Harry Nilsson's similar recordings will show how a sweet voice can carry it off.<br /><br />Sir Paul's latest effort brings to mind, instead, Randy Newman's \\"I'm Dead (But I Don't Know It).\\"<br /><br />Too bad.

055380684X|5.0|Does practice make perfect? I have often wondered about the truth of that aphorism. A brief look at any physical or intellectual endeavor shows that some people seem to practice just as hard as accomplished performers without achieving anywhere near the same level of mastery.<br /><br />In \\"The Talent Code,\\" Daniel Coyle argues that practice does perfect, provided that it is the sort of \\"deep practice\\" that triggers myelin, which is the material that wraps around the axons in the brain and is believed to be the source of mastery. As Coyle puts it, myelin trumps social prosperity, peace, freedom, mobility and paradigms. Deep practice fires impulses that strengthen myelin. It is no wonder that Florence of the late fifteenth century developed many of the greatest artists ever, Russia maintained a monopoly on the chess world for the later half of the twentieth century, and the Dominican Republic produces more major League baseball players per capita than anyplace else. Their common denominator is an environment and coaching regimen that systematizes practice into appropriate, repeatable steps, which develop skill circuits to the point that the learners are unaware they're using them.<br /><br />The three steps to deep practice detailed in \\"The Talent Code\\" are \\"chunking\\" by absorbing the whole skill and breaking it into small parts, repeating the activity, and \\"feeling\\" it. Coyle strongly suggests that learners cannot achieve mastery alone; rather, they need master coaches who can teach the required skills on infinitely deeper levels, perceive the learner's uniqueness, know the path to take for individual learners (what Coyle calls the GPS reflex), and point out learner errors honestly and memorably.<br /><br />This book may well be one to which educators across the country will refer in reforming education, especially on the elementary level.

B002KSPKRS|2.0|I jumped on this as a daily deal and I am glad I got a good price.  If I purchased this at full price it would be on its way back by now.  It may still go back.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Easy set up<br />It is nice to do gaming while not worrying about the sound waking someone up in the house.  This was the main reason for the purchase.<br />You can pick up a lot more game sounds using this head set<br />Mic and hearing your voice in the head set is awesome<br /><br />Cons:<br />Fit is tight and it is not really that comfortable, I stretched them out a bit on a speaker and this improved the situation<br />Sound quality is thin and too tin can in tone.  Bass boost is non existent regardless of settings.  Stereo headphones these are not.

I do have to fast forward a few times every episode to skip those nude shots and i'm glad those are only a small part of the show. after watching a few episodes I went out and grabed the books. I've read 4 of them in the last 6 months and have loved ever second of it!

B004ZN9NCY|5.0|Pink Floyd<br />UMMAGUMMA<br /><br />CD #1 - LIVE ALBUM<br /><br />- Astronomy Domine - a very good live version of the song found (in its studio form) in the \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" album.<br /><br />- Careful With that Axe, Eugene - This is a great live song.  The studio version of this one can be found in the \\"Relics\\" anthology.<br /><br />- Set the controls for the heart of the sun<br />- A saucerful of secrets  - the studio versions of these two songs are on the \\"A saucerful of secrets\\" album.  I prefer these live versions to the studio versions.<br /><br />This live CD is in the Progressive-Rock style<br /><br />CD #2 - STUDIO ALBUM<br /><br />Although these 12 tracks are part of five `songs', this has the feel of one long song.  This CD is in the style of Progressive-FOLK (and not Progressive-Rock) but it is very entertaining in its own right.<br /><br />Those new to early PF need to understand that, at this point in their career, they were playing experimental music, which is very different from their post \\"Dark side of the moon\\" years.  However, as an early Progressive band, this is a very good example of the genre.<br /><br />This new remaster lifts UMMAGUMMA up to a five star double album.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000002U0D Relics]]
B004J4WKDI|3.0|For a book that has remained on a best seller list for 12 weeks, I couuldn't have been more disappointed.  It remains half read! I failed to connect with,  or maintain interest in--- the charachters and the milieu in which it was set!
B004ZN9ERI|5.0|Pink Floyd<br />The Piper at the Gates of Dawn<br /><br />Pink Floyd's debut is prototypical late 1960's musical experimentation but done more successfully, and entertainingly, than many of their counterparts (compare this to The Stone's \\"... Majesties\\" album, for example).  Those who are familiar with early PF will be thrilled with this brilliant remaster.  Those who are not familiar with early PF should understand that, in this phase of their career, they are a very different band than the one that produced \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  In this album they are `hippy progressive' with little effort being made to creating a radio hit.  Yet this remains a great introduction to the band.  This remaster lifts the album to five stars.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really like this game, it distracts the mind. it also really entertaining when I'm bored I play . try it out
B004ZN9J0K|4.0|Pink Floyd<br />A Saucerful of Secrets<br /><br />Pink Floyd's \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is very much in the same vain as their debt album but, to my taste, not quite as good as that debut.  Still, it is a very entertaining album and this brilliant remaster does improve the experience.  Two of the best songs on this album are the title track and `Set the controls for the heart of the sun\\", but I prefer the live versions of these two songs as found in the \\"Ummagumma\\" double CD.  Although Syd Barrett had left the band, he does contribute to this album with his `Jugband Blues'.  Those curious about Syd Barrett, and are new to his solo work, might be interested the \\"An Introduction to Syd Barrett\\" album, which also contains a couple of non-album Pink Floyd singles.<br /> I give \\"Saucerful\\" four stars (4 ½).<br /><br />[[ASIN:B003YP7NAI An Introduction to Syd Barrett]]

B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|Pink Floyd<br />Meddle<br /><br />This is the beginning of the `modern' era for Pink Floyd, although they do not entirely abandon their experimental roots.  Those who only know the \\"Dark Side\\" era will recognize that sound in `One of These Days' (as well as elements in other tunes in this album) but there is still plenty of the early era here as well.  This remastered CD is excellent in its clarity and it increases the enjoyment of this album.  This is a Five Star album.

0385535139|2.0|I have read most of John's books.  Usually I like them.  About half way through I had had enough of this one.  The characters are real and probably very true to the lawyer trade, but the story doesn't move very fast.  A lot of people thought the book was very funny.  I thought it was just a sad commentary on our legal system.  Sorry folks!
1400052181|1.0|I honestly can't believe anyone likes this book.  It's a Frankenbook - a bunch of disjointed stories thrown together.  The author certainly likes to hear herself speak as she wrote, and wrote, and wrote - often about herself. Terrible.  There is an interesting story at the core but the author didn't know how to communicate it clearly or concisely.  What a waste of time.

030788743X|4.0|It isn't often that you come across a book tailored to geeks and nerds that isn't a new Star Wars encyclopedia or the Making of The Hobbit. Without the intervention of friends who brought this book to my attention, I would have never considered picking up READY PLAYER ONE. And I am clearly a big nerd - I have Star Trek toys, Farscape comics, a replica of Jayne's hat from Firefly, and the complete series of Battlestar Galactica on DVD including the extra DVDs. Yeah, I'm a pretty big nerd, even though my nerdom is science fiction more than video games and obscure 80s movies.<br /><br />READY PLAYER ONE is set in the near future where a virtual game platform called the OASIS has taken over life as we know it. People go to school on it, work on it, spend their entire lives on it, and thousands of people have dedicated their lives to finding the egg - the prize of a quest set by the dying founder, James Halliday, with billions of dollars and control of OASIS as the reward. The main character, Wade, also known as Parzival, is an 18 year old \\"gunter\\", a kid who has basically given up a semblance of a real life in exchange for questing for the Egg, but since he's poor, lives with an aunt that hates him, and stuck pretty much where he is, his chance of success is low, until fate gives him the one clue that he needs...<br /><br />Let me just start by saying that yes, this is a book directed at geeks of all types. Science fiction, gaming, 80s pop music, 80s teen movies, 80s television, 70s anime... Did I mention gaming? Yes, this entire book is basically the tale of a giant game composed of little games - MUDs (if you're ever in the market for a good MUD, I know them all sadly), console games, MMOs, computer games, arcade games. Wade is an expert, and Ernest Cline is an expert at guiding us through this maze of games and pop culture and weird trivia needed to solve Halliday's quest. Weaving all this information and bits and pieces together, and having the reader make sense of it when they might not have seen WarGames 500 times is hard, but Cline keeps track of everything and guides the reader along the story with ease and precision.<br /><br />Wade is an amazing, complex character that you can't help but root for. This kid, in a desperate search for a better life, has basically sacrificed reality (school, friends, a life, etc) for the hunt. He's made friends on the inside - his best friend Aech is the first, a snarky, bold character famous for his skills, eventually joined by the famed girl geek Art3mis and Japanese brothers Daito and Shoto. All are on the search for the same thing - the Egg that will grant them control. And all are being hunted by the same organization, the IOI, egg hunters led by the evil, manipulative Sorrento.<br /><br />This book had heart, and at its heart was a message - don't let fantasy overtake your reality. I mean, it's a message I could sure use. I spend waaaaay too much time surfing the web or playing games. And the world building in this book is spot on and BELIEVEABLE. I can really see something like OASIS taking over our world, but at the same time, I can feel myself wanting that to happen. The possibilities of OASIS are endless and just seeing all this with my own eyes would be amazing. (And yes, Warner Brothers does have the film rights, but this book seems like it would be very hard to translate to screen.)<br /><br />I'll let you explore the book yourself to find every geeky nuance and humorous reference. Let me just say that this book has almost everything you could look for - fun, action, excitement, romance, nerdiness, humor, tension, and uniqueness. It's not the best written book on the block, but Cline has clearly put heart and soul into this to create the ultimate geek novel. I just wish that maybe the ending had been more climactic with more stakes on the line than just the Egg. It was almost disappointing, rendering my rating down a notch, but this book was almost perfect on every level, and abook I would wholeheartedly recommend.<br /><br />VERDICT: Only brought down by a slightly dull ending, READY PLAYER ONE is a geeky tour de force - great characters, a great plot, and so many pop culture references that your little nerdy eyes will explode. If you are a geek, this book is for you. Also, this guy wrote the screenplay for FANBOYS. This book is a step up.book I would wholeheartedly recommend.<br /><br />VERDICT: Only brought down by a slightly dull ending, READY PLAYER ONE is a geeky tour de force - great characters, a great plot, and so many pop culture references that your little nerdy eyes will explode.

B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I was reluctant to pick this book up. Oh great, I thought, another boring &#34;redemption of the human spirit&#34; novel. I only began this book because of the author, Khaled Hosseini. But as soon as I finished the first chapter, I was hooked.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead...<br /><br />The characters were complex, and the husband, Rasheed, is portrayed very well. He's the bad guy, but he loves his son, and that makes him a tiny bit sympethetic. ( I'm still totally glad he died, tho. )<br /><br />I liked this book more then Kite Runner. It had more point to it. And I liked the semi happy ending. Tariq and Laila find each other, and the violent, corrupt, government finds brief stabilty. But the book hints that this lull won't be for long. That the country will lapse into civil war again.<br /><br />I think that Khaled Hosseini is a superb writer, and that's great, coming from me.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|It had been many years since I last read a King book, and I was happy to be welcomed back to his ability to draw me in to his world. So much has already been written in the reviews, but I will add...I did not find the story slow nor boring, even if it is over 800 pages long. With that said, when I concluded the final sentence, I was left with a little sadness, much like a friend was moving away. This is something that only happens with the best of the books, which this was for me.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I've been a Jane Eyre fanatic ever since I fell head over heels with Mr. Rochester in the seventh grade and I was very much looking forward to seeing this version which I had high hopes for.  Alas, this Jane Eyre suffers very much from the same problem that bedeviled the Keira Knightley version of Pride and Prejudice: there is simply no way to tell the story coherently in two hours.  And starting the film with Jane running away from Thornfield and then flashing back to the events that brought her there simply confused the plot.<br /><br />The film is like a disjointed sequence of scenes following each other because so many scenes were omitted from the book to make the movie fit into its time frame.  There is little time for character development and less for plot development.  Visually the movie is beautiful, the cinematography is outstanding, but there just isn't enough movie to do justice to the story.  And of all the people to delete from the film version, they should never have omitted Grace Poole, the taciturn keeper of the mad Mrs. Rochester who is a small but absolutely central character in the book.<br /><br />Mia Wasikowska (I was tempted to copy another reviewer and call her Mia Whatchamacallit but I did take the trouble to look up her name) is an excellent Jane, showing much of the charm and naivete she exhibited in Alice in Wonderland.  And she looks just right for the part, very young and pale and somewhat plain and mousy.  Judi Dench is a charming and likable Mrs. Fairfax.  The rest of the cast is also very good, although I wouldn't say outstanding, with the glaring exception of Michael Fassbender as Mr. Rochester.  Fassbender simply is not Rochester.  I found him just lukewarm instead of displaying the brooding passion that made Orson Welles and Timothy Dalton so memorable in that role.<br /><br />Overall, it's not a bad version of Charlotte Bronte's masterpiece, but it's a fair-to-middling movie of one of the greatest novels in English literature.  Go for the Dalton movie; it's still the best one out there.<br /><br />Judy Lindo for the Dalton movie; it's still the best one out there.<br /><br />Judy Lind
B002V091IO|5.0|Last month, I started reading David Nicholl's \\"One Day\\". I didn't know, back then, that it had been turned into a movie. I still haven't seen it.<br /><br />I was charmed by the fluency of the style, the muted, though occasionally blatant humor, and the underlying sadness. The style is never openly poetic ; yet the whole novel is tinged with poetry.<br /><br />Two young persons, a boy and a girl (what a surprise !) are subliminally in love. So, why does it take them twenty years clearly to reach that conclusion ?<br /><br />That question is at the core of the novel.<br /><br />Young Emma is, from the start, a very intense, unreasonable, left wing militant.<br /><br />Dexter is a selfish, ambitious, irresponsible, alcoholic TV presenter.<br /><br />Neither wants a \\"normal\\" life, the sort of life that makes you say : \\"Is that all there is ?\\"<br /><br />Over the years, they both calm down and have the courage to admit what they knew all along : they were made for each other and no one else will do.<br /><br />The sadness comes from the realisation that they have both wasted a lot of years with other partners ; the nostalgia comes from the memories of all the things they should have said and done together.

I was pleasantly surprised by _Death Magnetic_, which I consider a marked improvement over _St. Anger_. Nevertheless, _Beyond Magnetic_ failed to impress me at all the first time through. I haven't even considered listening to it again. Clearly the correct choices were made concerning what should have been included on the LP; unfortunately, these five songs were not left on the editing room floor.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I had very low expectations about this album and after hearing \\"Tattoo\\" I was afraid that this would be a big failure, but VH have proved me wrong. This Album is everthing I was looking for after 1984, the sound is raw, fast, aggressive...<br /><br />Ok we have to accept that this guys are in their 50´s approaching 60's mark, no one could sing the same as they did in their 20's but for me Dave does a great job, ok the guy has a flamboyant personality but this is the guy is the original rockstar, long before Vince Neil, Bret Michaels, Axl Rose, etc. Eddie is the guitar god he deserves to be, sober no one can compare to his guitar work, it was time to see this guy shine.<br /><br />I dont' care if most of the songs are from old demos, after all that was a great move to catch the old vibe and those are their songs!!! The only one who cares about it is the Bitter Sammy Hagar...<br /><br />I don't buy originals cds as i used to, but in my opinion I'm 100% satified with the money I spend on this one.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this CD Now!! If you are a ballad pop Van Hagar fan...well this is not for you...
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Anyone who loves a come from behind story should see Secretariat!  I love everything about it.  The movie does have one of the original races in it which is neat since it shows the real Secretariat for those too young to remember Secretariat's amazing races.  The item arrived in excellent condition and on time.  I would recommend this movie for families or anyone liking upbeat positive don't give up type movies.  I can also recommend the seller for getting it to me on time and in excellent condition.

0307593312|4.0|I am not quite done with this book but whatever happens next, I wanted to offer something that most of the reviews that I've read had not.<br /><br />This book is most certainly Sci Fi/Fantasy and it has strong Film Noir(ish) elements, along with an enormous amount of brilliant insight into both Japanese culture, philosophy, religion, etc. and more often than not - it comes out strongly for the side of reason and individualism, but in a very Japanese way - that is...subtly.<br /><br />There is a strong mystery and adventure story here. Partially about two people finding that missing spark within them, igniting it once more, and this is brought on by a battle that they need to fight. It's a morality tale, with great power and meaning. And while it starts out as a slightly odd, unusual and slow paced climb...once the roller coaster goes down the hill, you are swept away.<br /><br />Many people mention that it deals with themes of alienation (no pun intended - if you read the book), but in fact - like American Beauty - it shows you people who were already alienated and how they begin to climb back into the real world again...even if that real world is not really real...and is Murakami's creation.<br /><br />You will not find a post-modernist, moral relativistic load of crap here. What you will find instead is the poetry and brilliance of a well-crafted mystery about two people fighting a strange cult, or group, or force in the world that is responsible for some pretty terrible things. And in the process...they become heroes to others and more importantly, and for the first time...to themselves.<br /><br />20th Century Boys had some very strong similarities to this book, so if you enjoyed that, this will probably be a hit. Only warning is to give it time. A lot of time. Luckily, the cover is beautiful so glace at it every once in a while...and stay away from goats.
0440241901|3.0|Ok the romance was a bit more believable at the end than all the other books of hers that I have read and yes the tension our heroine is feeling in the beginning of the book is palpable, BUT I personally read this author to be amused and there were surprisingly few lol moments in this one. I just didn't find it as amusing as her other books. Good story, wrong genre? I had to take off two stars. One because it isn't a classic by anyone's definition and two because it did not do what I bought it to do.

0307959856|2.0|While I was expecting a treat, I got a pretty mediocre read.  I don't think Eliza Bennett's reincarnation does her much good.  Both she and Darcy having lost their edges are somewhat dreary and predictable, and what's up with Charlotte Lucas?  I was pretty sick of Wickham and Lydia at the end of P and P, so it was kind of onerous ploughing through more of their stuff.  I'd rather hear about Mary or Kitty.  I think that which bothered me most was the clumsy manner in which she handled the exposition.  That post trial monologue did not do justice to Jane A.; PD James should have adhered to the old adage: \\"show, don't tell\\"<br />Having said all this, the book did keep my attention and I suppose a poor book by PD James is better than many that are out there, but a far lesser author with an excellent vocabulary and sense of style seemed to be at work here.

B0078N2MTE|4.0|Here is a strange and twisty cinematic take on what has become a very popular viewing theme this past while since the release of '2012'. The great Ebert gave it two thumbs up simply because of its creative ending, and I would heartily concur for that and other reasons. When it comes to handling a clich&eacute; of a subject - the apocalypse - 'Take Shelter' seems to be drawing from the biblical story of Noah. Rest assured, this movie is not another 'Evan Almighty' spoof on how to save people from their own environmental irresponsibility. Instead of building an ark, however, Curtis, with the tentative support of his wife and child, ventures into a half-cocked notion of building an impregnable storm shelter on the outskirts of a little Texas oil town in the middle of Tornado Alley. This is, ironically, Bible-Belt land but Curtis finds it hard to enlist the help of his God-fearing neighbours. They're just too busy making money drilling for gas and oil to take him seriously about the big one coming. To complicate matters, Curtis comes from a family with a history of schizophrenia which makes his visions potentially suspect. This low-budget, even-keeled, and well-managed movie has a number of timely confrontations where Curtis and his immediate family put everything on the line to see this disjointed scheme through one way or the other. The interesting thing here is that the filmmaker keeps the action moving in the direction of a climax that the audience isn't entirely prepared for. While Curtis is bracing for the big one, his loyal and long-suffering wife and child are hoping for a medical recovery with life returning to normal. At this juncture, the plot has a potentially win-win ending to it. If the world comes to an end, as foreshadowed by darkening skies and lots of heavy rain, Curtis becomes the hero and makes a believer out of his sceptical wife. If it doesn't pan out, his wife will then be able to help a shattered Curtis back to normalcy. Watch this movie if you want to see how the screen writers throw a curve at the audience who, if they are anyway like me, may have been lulled into thinking that this film is simply a parody on those who would fixate out of fear on end-times.see how the screen writers throw a curve at the audience who, if they are anyway like me, may have been lulled into thinking that this film is simply a parody on those who would fixate out of fear on end-times.

0545425115|5.0|In a grim future North America, the heroine, Katniss, is both the prey and the hunter in a fight to the death survival contest:  The Hunger Games.  Children from twelve to eighteen are \\"reaped\\" annually to participate, and when her twelve year old sister, Prim, is chosen, Katniss, sixteen, steps forward and takes her place.  All of this is played out on live television to the delight of the populace, or the despair of those with family in the \\"arena\\".  The Games are quite a spectacle from the reaping day until the twenty-four contestants are released upon each other. The contest is an extended one, going on for weeks, to maximize the pleasure of the audience.  It is brutal.  Physical prowess, brute strength, intelligence, experience with weapons and locating food are invaluable to the participants.  Alliances are formed and disolved as the games continue.  Ultimately compassion, fairness, and even love play a small but vital part in the lives of those who remain.  This is a thrilling read.  There is not a dull page in it.  Katniss is charming and resourceful.  You must read to discover the outcome.  The only drawback is - this is the first of the trilogy and then you will certainly want the next book, Catching Fire, in your hands at the end of this one.

It was the perfect book to sit back and relax with while sitting poolside.  I literally laughed out loud and few times.  Shopie Kinsella never disappoints me!
0765350386|5.0|The story starts out slowly, but consistently gains momentum towards an exciting climax. The writing is quite good, and the characterizations feel refreshingly genuine by the end of the book. The plot includes several interesting twists that contribute a well balanced delivery of suspense and substance to the story.<br /><br />Although this is only the first installment of a trilogy encompassing a greater plot, the story of this book is neatly resolved in a satisfying fashion, while establishing the roles of each character in the ultimate fate of the Final Empire.<br /><br />All in all, this book is an excellent example of what a fantasy storybook should be.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|That the whole is greater than the sum of its parts is not always true but  for wool it s, in my opinion, certain.  As stand alone books they are good, especially #1 which is the most complete. I don't think the other four books tell enough of a story to be considered complete on their own. Together the five books create one great - probably classic story. I'm not really waiting in anticipation of sequels.  They wouldn't be wool, they would be \\"pulls\\" in the fabric of a finely crafted work. Too many stories are ruined when authors try to make too many stories out of them. I think the fact that each book was fairly short kept the author focused.  I believe these five books will stand the test of time.

B000006TSC|5.0|I just can't stop listening to this thing ever since I discovered Camel somewhere back in the 1980s. I see a lot of complaints that Camel was turning toward pop here and putting in more vocals, which for most bands who are trying to be something they're not is usually the kiss of death. But Camel pulls it off brilliantly. Whether you're into pop or prog-rock you should love this. The harmonic sequences are simple but brilliant. Lots of records have only one or maybe only two good tracks, but this one has three that I'd put in the category of \\"amazing\\" (Echoes, Sleeper, Summer Lightning). Buy it only if you want to be hooked 4ever and 4ever lament that fact that this band never made it bigger.

As mentioned elsewhere, cardboard slip covers for all five albums, without the gatefolds that were the covers of the original vinyls of Goodbye and Hello and Blue Afternoon. If, like me, you still have the original albums, then no problem. Might we expect then that the rest of the canon will be similarly packaged? Please? I assume anybody reading this already knows the albums well enough to make further laudatory review redundant,but Blue Afternoon is one of the greatest albums ever made.<br />Note - I got my set from amazon.co.uk.

There wasn't a night I eagerly flipped through the pages there were even nights I read only a few chapters just so my Hunger Games experience could last just a while longer. Now that it's over. What shall I read next????? Can anyone help me? Please.
0061564893|1.0|Whether this story is true or not, this is a fascinating book, with myriads of details, mostly unverifiable (read the other reviews of this book, most of them with a lone *).<br />Unfortunately, there is nothing left of the Chinese peregrinations (the findings that Menzies claims are meretrifles).<br />1421 BC or 1421 AD, what difference does it make? This could have happened at any time!<br />Here is my explanation of the silence behind the Chinese world tours.<br />I am of the opinion that as there were many sailors who went around the world centuries before Christopher Colombus or Magellano, in fact those sailors went a long way on our oceans as soon as ships existed. It is just a matter of statistics: since the beginning of times, tens of thousands of ships have been sailing from point A to point B; however, a small proportion of these ships never reached point B, but got \\"lost\\" and landed in a country C that was remote from the \\"civilized world\\" and, by this erroneous sailing, they took part in the disclosure of information from A to C.<br />It took only a very small proportion of these \\"lost\\" ships to scatter the human knowledge around the planet.<br />This theory explains why there are (were) so many similarities in our planet's various civilizations. Examples abound: burial rituals, pyramids, calendar, etc.<br />What Menzies omits to tell is that his Chinese expeditions did not leave behind a significant trace of their passage, whereas the Spanish established an Empire going from Florida to California, Mexico and down to Argentina.<br />Quite a significant difference! worth waiting another 1492-1421= 71 years!

B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />Rating: 2.5<br /><br />  In many respects, 'Moneyball' is not any different from most 'baseball' movies that place the national pastime on its ubiquitous, saccharine pedestal. That can be expected. Where 'Moneyball' differs, is that it seeks to invite a new 'player' to the table--the computer geek. Now all the aspiring Bill Gates' of the world can take a seat with the battle-scarred, beer-swilling veterans, who've been analyzing the game for years, utilizing an intuition grounded in their 'gut' perceptions, instead of a set of statistics, organized by a computer program. This is the basic premise of Brad Pitt's overrated Academy Award nominated film, which is more about the business of baseball, than the game itself.<br /><br />  For awhile, the story of Billy Beane, the former mediocre baseball player turned general manager of the Oakland A's baseball team, proves to be fairly interesting. After failing to beat the NY Yankees in the first round of the playoffs in 2001, the owner of the As gives Beane an ultimatum: win the World Series next year, but with a vastly reduced budget (as the A's principal players, such as Jason Giambi, have been traded away). Beane meets with his staff of scouts (played by former professional baseball players and scouts), who lend a real air of credibility to the proceedings. That group appears to be clueless and sends Beane in search of a new approach to resolve his quandary of finding underrated baseball talent, without the aid of the big bucks.<br /><br />  While attempting to negotiate a trade with the Cleveland Indians, Beane discovers a low level Indian employee, statistician Peter Brand, a Yale graduate, who picks players by means of sophisticated computer analysis (Brand is a composite character based primarily on Beane's real-life top assistant, Paul DePodesta, who refused permission to use his name in the film). Geeky Jonah Hill plays Brand, and for half of Act 2, he advises Beane on which bargain basement players to trade for. Brand looks primarily at 'on base percentage' and Beane (with Brand in tow) makes a house call , on one occasion, to fading major league catcher, Scott Hatteberg, asking him whether he'd be interested in converting to playing first base (the answer is of course, affirmative!). Beane manages to pick up more bargains, including submarine hurler, Chad Bradford, with the aid of Brand, and by the time spring training rolls around, Beane is confident that his motley crew, can compete against the more financially endowed teams, including their ultimate nemesis: the Yanks!<br /><br />  The drama (and one's interest), only lasts for a little while longer. There's an effective scene where Beane comes into conflict with his scouting crew, who resent the presence of Brand, and his disdain for their 'intuition'. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, manages to acquit himself nicely as A's manager, Art Howe, who doesn't like Beane telling him how to manage his team (but his part is all too brief). Sadly, the narrative eventually has nowhere to go, as there's virtually no additional interesting enough conflict, which propelled the characters so fitfully along, in the film's first half. The A's 20 game winning streak is attributed to Brand's highly questionable miracle system (it should be noted that the A's still had some 'big money' holdovers, such as pitchers Zito and Hudson, who were not selected as a result of Brand's machinations). Brand has little to do in the second half of the film, except act as Beane's glorified cheerleader, with Beane, now wheeling and dealing on his own, sometimes acting outside the purview of his brainiac assistant. Nonetheless, the film's scenarists afford the geeky Brand, with his own hagiography, now allowed to sit at the table with 'the big boys'.<br /><br />  Without a doubt, 'Moneyball' has perhaps the most anti-climactic climax, in recent film history. Not only do the A's fail to make the first round of the Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring. Even more embarrassing (and this is supposed to be impressive), we're told that the Red Sox, utilizing Beane and Brand's statistical approach, win their first World Series since 1918, a couple of years later. Beane's consolation prize is thus held up as some kind of great victory for humanity!<br /><br />  'Moneyball' is one of the few baseball films, that refuses to fictionalize the characters they are portraying. Unfortunately, we learn next to nothing about any of them, except for the fact that they have hearts of gold (again, as to be expected). Some time is spent portraying the aging David Justice, as a surly, 'non-team' player. But after a pep talk from Beane, he agrees to 'step up to the plate', and provide guidance to the 'younger players', who soon come together and accomplish the miracle 20 game winning streak.<br /><br />  All-Star writers Sorkin and Zaillian fall flat in attempting to infuse Beane's character, with a meaningful internal arc. Beane must not only overcome his past failure as a player (which we see in a series of flashbacks), but also must bond with his teenage daughter. Beane's nobility is undercut by such pretentious pronouncements as \\"money is not important\\", even though he's portrayed as a ruthless wheeler dealer, who uses shady tactics to gain an advantage over his rivals. According to Beane, introducing the new dry world of statistics, is what he wants to be remembered for, not earning a World Series ring.<br /><br />  'Moneyball' must also contend with the additional deficit of another 'phone in' Brad Pitt performance. No matter how hard he tries, Pitt invariably cannot play anyone but Brad Pitt. Ultimately, Pitt should not be completely blamed for attempting to elevate Beane (and baseball) to mythic status. In the end, however, it's the general public, who, year after year, places the 'national pastime', on that saccharine pedestal. After all, baseball, is nothing more than a business and entertainment spectacle, and anyone who tells you otherwise, is, I believe, trying to sell you the Brooklyn Bridge.he Division playoffs but we're told that Beane is still trying to earn his first World Series ring.

B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I saw this version at a theater in NY a few days ago. While I prefer the orginal POTO musical, I think it's a shame that LND never made it to Broadway. The story is gripping, and heartbreaking (depending on your POV, of course). For me, a Phantom Phan, I loved seeing Phantom and Christine together again... even if they play a little loosely with the original POTO ending. It's a great \\"what could have been\\" story and well worth seeing. A really nice story continuation.<br /><br />The songs are, in my opinion, a little less sophisticated lyrically than the original POTO lyrics, but there are a few songs that really do stick with you. Try it out on spotify, they have the entire album to listen to for free.
B0062IQNG4|5.0|Great music.  I like the diversity of the songs.  I'm really liking Bruno Mars right now and was glad to hear one of his songs on here.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Fantastic writing, great acting, perfectly cast, this movie had it all. Very humbling to remember a piece of our not-so-distant past. This is a film I will continue to watch once a year.

0375869026|5.0|WONDER by R. J. Palacio is a fantastic book that is easy to read and children of upper elementary and middle school age would greatly benefit from it, as well as like it.  WONDER is the story of August Pullman, Auggie, who was born with a severe facial deformity, He is one of those kids who makes his physical abnormality invisible once you get to know him because of how great a kid he is. I am sure we all know people who are like this in certain ways. Auggie is an amazing child who is not only a nice person you like right away but has so much else going for him including being quite intelligent. He is a grand example of how people are often times more beautiful on the inside and because of that, it shines through to the outside. Auggie is accustomed to being stared at and knows that people will look and point but takes it all in stride as he also has a wonderful attitude and personality.<br /><br />Having been home schooled for years, it is decided it is time for Auggie to attend school and so is enrolled for fifth grade and although he's frightened, says he will at least try it. It is no surprise that Auggie learns many valuable lessons as he learns that not everyone is as nice as he is. He also, however, changes some of the others' attitudes and the highs and lows of the story will keep you turning pages and reaching for a Kleenex from time to time. Palacio writes so well that readers can relate to all the characters and events because of the different points of view that are used to give the story such well developed realism. As a middle school teacher for many years, I can see this story played out in so many ways and would highly recommend it to that age group, as well as adults who want an easy and thought provoking story.

B003L77G10|4.0|My wife told me a friend of hers at work told her to watch The Good Wife and we only caught on in the latter half of the 2nd Season. After one episode we were hooked. For Christmas I bought her the First Season and now we're on the 2nd. Only went through one disc so far, but it's entertaining to say the least.<br /><br />Alicia Florrick is not only a bright, sensitive woman, but she could the girl next door. The character Eli Gold is a scene-stealer and it's fun watching Alicia and Cary match wits, all the while we're left to wonder if Alicia and Peter, her husband, will ever get back together.<br /><br />Our favorite character is Kalinda. They throw her in subtly, but with style, and she's clearly a necessity in the firms success. You don't know whether to like or hate Will Gardner, the firm's partner who hired Alicia, but you definitely admire the woman, Diane Lockhart. She is the role model of the intelligent, people-smart woman out to make a name for herself.<br /><br />If you haven't already started watching The Good Wife, do so now! You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />by David Lucero, author of The Sandman
B003PIUC02|3.0|I expected more, the acting was good, but the filming was poor and there was a lot more sex and nudity than there need to be. I know this was the way it was then, but showing that the sexual event happened and then moving along with the story would have been better.

1594202710|1.0|Kissinger's views of China were cast in stone during the 1950s and 1960s. He was a player on the stage from the late 1960s to the mid 1970s. His name can still open doors, but I'm at a loss to know what he can tell anyone about China today. The book is obsessed with Mao and with the idea of Chinese Culture being responsible for every decision in China as opposed to individuals being responsible. That \\"culture\\" view was popular in the old days when China was effectively closed to the west and the only means of analysis available was culture. But those days are gone.<br /><br />Kissinger as usual heaps praise on Mao and delivers all sorts of pro-Mao spin. But there is nothing new in what he says on those subjects.<br /><br />The worst part of the book is undoubtibly the coverage of the 1979 China-Vietnam War. Kissinger inexplicably wants to see that war as a turning point in the cold war and a strategic victory. From his point view, a response less than war with China by the Soviet Union in 1979 was a victory for China. This is in spite of the fact that the Chinese incursion into vietnam was a costly embarrsing failure that the Vietnamese beat to a halt mostly on their own.<br /><br />He also claims that the war was caused by reasons similar to those that led the US into the Vietnam War. There are things said in the chapter on Vietnam that defy any sort of reason. As an example, Kissinger claims the was negotiating a deal with the Chinese for a cambodian colialition government including Lon Nol, Pol Pot and Sihanouk. That the deal was designed to keep Vietnam out of Cambodia and that it not happening was the fault of the US Congress. Or how about the claim that China saw the hand of the Soviet Union in the Iranian Revolution.<br /><br />Best of all, he has the Chinese leadership attacking the Carter Administration for its weakness toward the Soviet Union. Trade agreements, Arms Control and efforts at peace in the middle east were all bad policy. A vague statmeent about Palestinians supposedly encouraged soviet influence in the middle east (called Europe's flank by Kissinger), undermined our strong ally Sadat and put world energy supplies in danger. He also explains the limits of American Relpolitik which was apparently outright military aid for the Khmer Rouge against Vietnam.<br /><br />By the tone of the book, Kissinger now sees the US alliance with China as his best shot at an untainted legacy. And he sees the China-Vietnam war as his lever to claim a share of responsiblity for the fall of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />There is also extensive coverage of the reform era in China. But its more a history of how Kissinger sees himself as the key player in the reform era in China. This is somewhat par for the course for the author.<br /><br />The only value I can see in this book is that its author is still influential and the book is a window into what he is thinking. The book is by degrees an exercise in egotism, vanity and self-delusion.t Palestinians supposedly encouraged soviet influence in the middle east (called Europe's flank by Kissinger), undermined our strong ally Sadat and put world energy supplies in danger.

B005VPRF0M|5.0|I had a lot of fun helping my 5 year old put this set together this morning.  I don't normally like that sort of thing, but the directions were fantastic and simple enough for him to do most of it.  This was our first lego set and I'm super excited to buy more!  The finished products included in this set are extremely cool looking and fun to play with.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. You can tell that despite what happend to Jaycee, she never lost her courage and her willingness to be a better person. Even in the confinement of a backyard, she made the best of what she had and the situation she was in. She is a truly amazing person and a true inspiration. In her writing you could always feel her love and tenderness for her kids and animals. You can feel how warm she really is. My favorite part of the book is when she describes the therapy she went through to begin her life long healing process. She encourages one to never give up hope. Again, she is truly an amazing person.

0375869026|5.0|I fully expect to see this book on at least one award list for children's books and perhaps more than one this year.  Is it that well written and that quality?  No, but it has a story that grabs you and doesn't let go and I think that will win over those who will nominate and choose the awards.<br /><br />Wonder is about August Pullman, a 5th grader who was born with a facial abnormality.  He has had nothing but love and support at home including his schooling.  His parents have decided that it is time for him to attend school with ordinary, normal kids.  You can imagine that some of the students and parents are unhappy with the decision to allow August to attend their school.  August, however, is more than an ordinary kid and in the process of trying to just be a normal helps everyone in his world learn some life lessons.<br /><br />This is a book that students and their parents will both enjoy reading and talking about together.  The former teacher in me sees so many classroom possibilities with this book.  It is written in short chapter like sections with different points of view from several different characters in the book.  I think even students who struggle with reading will find it easy to read and follow this book.  They will be interested enough in the story that they will want to finish the book.  Books for boys are often hard to find, but this book has Star Wars, camping, and even the typical middle school boy fights.  One spoiler alert, the dog dies.  Watching for this book on the award lists!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|this was a really good book and it is one of my favorites. this was one of my first books i learnt to read. i have the soft cover and hard cover and now on my kindle. this book just tells us a little what life was like back then during the war. if you enjoyed this book i think you should read Pride and Prejudice if you have not read these books you should not be able to call yourself a female this book is also for men. i am still in school and when i asked one of my friends if she had read these books she asked, \\" aren't those soap operas?\\" My male teacher who was listening to the story was shocked to hear that she calls herself a girl. so read and recommend this book and much loved classic even if you are just protecting your gender. these aren't just sterling classics but titanium classics. this is a huge must read.
B0052U59F4|5.0|First let me say that I've never written a review, but I felt strongly enough about this book to do so. I, like so many others, saw this book discussed on the Today show. I read a lot and I read quickly and I read a large variety of genres, so when I saw all of the discussion about the subject matter of this book, I had to have it, it really wasn't what I expected! I was captivated! I do have some of the same criticisms as some of the other readers. I find it hard to believe that a college senior, whether a virgin or not, know NOTHING about sex at all but utters \\"holy f---\\" over and over. I find it hard to believe that she was so naive. She did blush ALOT. But overall, great story. Engaging. I realize some people cannot get past the BDSM and feel like its unhealthy to read or fantasize or indulge in this lifestyle. Rather than that, I took away from this book the love that blossomed between this naive girl and this broken man. She wanted to be with him, but didn't want that lifestyle. He knew nothing else. The story, to me, was about their journey together to be together and to be healthy! Loved it! Loved all three books!
B005SFS4ZU|1.0|Probably one of the most putrid things I've ever seen. I saw the show on the 1st national tour years ago and loved it, due to what I now realize was an excellent cast. We saw it again about 7 years later, and liked it much much less, due mostly to a \\"Christine\\" who evoked a very strong image of a secretary from Queens hanging onto a subway strap. Wretched. I happened upon this Albert Hall production on PBS, and was shocked after just a few minutes by the atrocious acting. It was amazing to see that since the play has become so popular it has also lost, at least in this production, any finesse or sincerity. It was totally played to the audience, there was no illusion or subtlety or suspension of reality, as I had experienced in the first tour. There was also an irritating palpable modernizing of the characters delivery, other than possibly the two men who run the opera. Call me cuckoo..but I do not remember \\"Christine\\" delivering the pivotal \\"Think Of Me\\" with an unrelenting, beaming smile, as she saunters around the stage like a drag queen in a Burlesque palace...the touching emotions and drama that I remember feeling at this number were stomped on.  The \\"Carlotta\\" was a horrifically bad actress. The Phantom? They might as well have had John Stamos or David Dinklehoff play him..LOUSY. I seem to be in the minority in my opinion, but after my initial excitement upon happening onto this viewing last night, I quickly found my face contorting into a gruesome grimace which remained until i could bare it no more, and even the \\"car wreck\\" appeal soon dissipated. A ROTTEN MESS.
B00597A6NU|4.0|World War II aviation enthusiasts will find enough holes in \\"Memphis Belle\\" to fly a B-17 through and it has been extensively dissected on the \\"Memphis Belle\\" website, as this is a real aircraft that has been fully restored. The \\"Memphis Belle\\" was the first Flying Fortress to complete 25 missions and then sent stateside with its crew to raise money for war bonds. This film purports to show what happened on that final mission but, of course, it is all fabrication. There are some subplots that would appear ludicrous to a real WWII bomber crew, not the least a co-pilot whining that he has nothing to do and then leaving his post during an air battle! In truth, bomber missions were not only long and grueling but dangerous, the pilot often getting killed or wounded along the way. Add to that the cheesy FX graphics and clich&eacute;d cast members (One Jew, one hillbilly, one poet, one Italian, a coward who learns courage etc) and you could write off this film as second rate.<br /><br />What saves it is excellent ensemble acting, great music, thrilling air combat scenes and one unforgettable vignette that shows the viciousness of air combat through the actual gun camera footage of German fighter planes. Watching the Forts get chewed to shreds in real life is sobering and adds some weight to the story. There is also a great acting role for David Strathairn, as the squadron commander, Col. Harriman who practically bleeds for his men. His showdown with the obnoxious public relations huckster Lt. Col. Derringer is a study of barely contained rage.<br /><br />A reliable cast rounds out the crew, from Mathew Modine's mother hen of a Captain Dearborn, Tate Donovan (\\"Damages\\") as his surly co-pilot, the always reliable Eric Stoltz, Harry Connick Jr. Sean Astin, D.B. Sweeney and a surprisingly sweet turn by Reed Diamond as top gunner, Virgil Hoogesteger.<br /><br />It's worth noting that in this age of computer-generated reality, the most convincing scenes are those of the 1/4 scale models of the B-17's which, lined up on the runway, look like the real deal. Only 6 real Fortresses were available for the film so the rest of the squadron was filled in by good old fashioned model making.ls of the B-17's which, lined up on the runway, look like the real deal.

B000IKQMFO|3.0|This is an average film that should have been a good film.  It is unsatisfying.<br /><br />Upon reflection, notwithstanding the Academy Award to Julian Fellows, the problem lies with the script.  It has the wrong feel.  Robert Altman did not understand the culture being depicted, and so it is depicted through a lens that doesn't capture it accurately.  There is dialogue in the script that is just wrong.  There are accents that are wrong.  There is body language that is wrong, that does not fit properly in the class structure of that society.  It isn't badly wrong, but it is consistently wrong throughout the film. It persistently undermines the credibility of the charcters.<br /><br />Notwithstanding reasonable acting, the scripted portrayal of the police inspector and his sidekick is particularly weak. It is utterly ham-fisted - something that fits in an Americn film, perhaps, but not on an English country estate in the early 1930's.  If the Director has decided to make a murder mystery drama, then he needs to make up his mind to do a murder mystery drama.  It cannot include inspector Clouseau and remain a serious film. The weakness of that portrayal undermines both the seriousness of the drama, and the critique of the English class structure.  That is not the only portrayal that is ham-fisted, either.<br /><br />Upper class English society was then (and sometimes even now, is) about reserve, suppression of emotion, subtlety, and irony.  If you were \\"in service\\" you were \\"in service\\".  Which member of the household staff in this film behaves as if they were \\"in service\\" or as if they understand what the term means?  Compare the conduct of the staff in this film with, for example, \\"The Remains of the Day\\", which captures it far, far better.<br /><br />There is far too much swearing, at the wrong times, for the wrong reasons, in the wrong way, and frequently by the wrong people.<br /><br />We have a Jewish American film producer at an estate in the English countryside, and the problem is that he is peculiar because he is a vegetarian? In that era?  In a society then riven with anti-semitism? Who is kidding whom?<br /><br />His lordship is an industrial sweatshop owner?  Really?  In that era the landed class had a very strong aversion to people who were \\"in trade\\".  This fellow had multiple illegitimate children with working girls in his sweatshops? Are you doing Dickens, or are you doing Jane Austen?  Make up your mind.<br /><br />Meanwhile his wife cavorts with the staff of strangers at the drop of a hot glass of milk? The scullery maid services every man in the place down in the kitchens, and hasn't been fired long since? Again, who is kidding whom?<br /><br />It's too much.  Way, way, way too much. That concatenation of improbabilities adds up to several shark-jumpings.<br /><br />At the end of the day, it is rooted in a basic problem: The director does not understand the society he is trying to depict on screen, and doesn't get that his portrayal tends to caricature.  It spoils what could have been a much better film.
B004AVMZWQ|5.0|This is xfiles on steroids. The characters are a little better developed and we love the weird situations. A possible exception is the parallel universe idea, which gets confusing with everyone having doubles. The character, Walter Bishop, is a big attraction because he is so ingenuous and unassuming.
0374275637|5.0|Disclaimer: So far, I've read a bit over half the book.<br />I recommend this to anyone who is interested in improving their decision making, both individual and group.  It is applicable to the material, rather than the emotional, domain.  It may help you decide what goals to set but it won't tell you who to marry.  (Although better decision making and understanding how others make decisions should spill over into improved relationships.)<br />One of the ways we can improve our problem solving ability is to gather more infomation.  Another way is to more effectively use that information.  Kahneman provides people like me a wide look into the way we make decisions and offers some help for enabling us to make better decisions.  Chapters are short, some are repetitive.  This is a good thing, since when our own foibles are being exposed the natural tendency is to discount the importance of the insights.  This book is not about complexity, abstract reasoning or creative problem solving skills.  It is about the ways we fool ourselves when we make decisions.  It is not about the neurobiology, neuropsychology, or evolutionary biology of the mind.  It is about the real world *observed* way that our wet-ware works and often leads us astray and about how we can improve on that.<br />The material presented has quite a lot of the insights that led to the papers Kahneman published in the '60s and 70's.  So, I would hope and expect that current college Psych courses have embodied this material and hence is less novel to Psych majors.  It is probably not for everyone.  I think his style is (no surprise) a bit academic and analytical.  The \\"just do it\\" crowd may have little patience in the self-examination that has to be part of the way this can help us improve our decisions.  Kahneman explains some of the absurd in politics and business.  A building estimated to cost $60MM ends up at $600MM, a kitchen rennovation quoted at $18,000 costs $38,000 when completed.  He explains it as not the result of corruption, conspiracy and stupidity, but as a failure of decision making.  The gems come fast and furious, but it is not a difficult book to read.  It requires no previous science (although some very basic probability and statistics wouldn't hurt) and isn't technical. In my opinion, everybody could profit from reading this; high schoolers, entrepreneurs, college students, middle management types and CEOs and Scinece post-docs.  Some of this stuff should be taught to our kids in their public school years.  Some of the stuff will ring some bells for some of us older people who have seen some of the errors described here acted out time after time in real life.  I'm buying copies for my kids.  (You can lead a horse to water.)
B0071T5PN0|3.0|This album contains great tracks like Tattoo, She's The Woman, Bullethead and Big River, the rest of the tracks leave much be desired.  They sound (dispite Eddie's impressive solos) too new age or radio freindly and Roth's vocals are seriously lacking in places compared to the classic and previous albums.  The album over all I am happy with but it pales in comparision to pretty much all of Van Halen's other album save Van Halen III, which could also have been great but didn't have the songs.
B003IY49S4|5.0|I have dabbled in buying jazz albums in the past and even own a few of the albums included in this collection. But when I came across this collection I bit the bullet and got the whole collection. This is great! An instant collection of classic albums. I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to these albums from start to finish and am sure that I will for years to come. Of all of my Amazon purchases over the past five years, this is the one that I feel absolutely giddy about. I'm going to order the second collection as well.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I've seen POTO at the Majestic theater in NY twice, once in 1989 and then in 2010, and the movie. I just finished watching this 25th anniversary film on PBS HD. Even with the led backgrounds this is the best production. Not having the led backgrounds would have made this 5 plus stars. This film shadows the film of the Australian production of Love Never Dies, which is still pretty good.<br />Why is people not liking it? 2 stars? really? The ballet parts were extended, which is one thing I had wished for, it is the Paris Opera House during Edgar Degas times after all. The ending is absolutely trilling, sitting beyond the theater's 12th row it's hard to see this drama. Sierra Boggess is awesome. This was an only Macintosh production, what a gift for Sir Webber! The Encore presentation with Sarah Brightman and  4 original phantoms doesn't really add for me, hey, it was a celebration night, they did the same with Les Miserables celebration. Is nice to see them around and boy can they still sing!<br />I cant afford to go to the Royal Albert Hall but my 55 inch screen and sound system make a nice substitute, so I will get this blu-ray.

006197806X|2.0|Pandemonium, pretty sums up this book. This book is not like reading the second book in a trilogy but reading the first book in a trilogy. Besides Lena there was no connectivity between the books as it relates to characters.The story with Raven and the homestead was boring. I created no attachment for Raven or Tack or any other characters not even Juilian not even to Lena. She is one of my least favorite heroines throughout the dystopian genre. I still don't see anything great in her, she seems flat, lacking passion for anything but running. I found the first 200 pages boring, took me over a week to read this book, which is unheard of it, it was a chore to finish, but the last word of this book was worth my pain and is the only reason why i will read the third book. Her writing is lacking passion even though there is romance and action it just feels without, like a blurry picture, maybe using a theasurus would help. With all this said, I still have to know whats going to happen, the last page is that much of a cliff hanger.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Bought this amp recently to drive some high-end headphones while using my ipod. I have to say that I was really impressed. This little amp easily powers my AKG 702's, which are massive phones, and my Bose over the ear phones as well. For my taste, using only the first bass setting is perfect, and the sound I get from the ipod is unbelievable. With a good set of phones, this little amp works very well. The fullness and clarity of sound is better than I expected, by a long shot. The amp straps easily to the ipod, with a silicon band, which is provided. I did have to buy the ipod patch cable to connect properly, but all in all, this was a great investment. I've only owned this product a couple weeks, but,the listening enjoyment I've already had certainly justifies the price, and then some. I did have the opportunity to try one belonging to a friend, but as soon as I did, I immediately got on line and ordered my own. If you want some very nice portable sound, this unit, at this price is hard to beat I should also mention that this amp charges easily by usb, and holds a charge for a very long time. In two weeks, I have charged it once, but didn't really need to, and just wanted a full charge. I highly recommend this product.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome and.I really regimens it for ppl who want free games and for something to keep them busy:-)
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|First off, this movie takes a different approach from the normal mainstream \\"I'm a badass lets say some really cliche sounding stuff\\" the whole entire movie and blow stuff up with rocket launchers. Yes it is indeed a slow movie, but stepping out of the regime of action and fast pace moving movies really helps the array of Hollywood movies. That is where Drive comes in. This artistic feel of a movie really helps keeps movies interesting, such as the fact that the few action scenes that are in this movie are superbly intense and sometimes stomach turning. This movie leaves you with unanswered questions and left assumptions, but that is the beauty of story telling, to keep the image and idea of this vague but great story running around in your head. Step out of the boundary of some garbage like Cowboys and Aliens and pop this movie in and enjoy the ride. If you feel my opinion on movies and story lines, this movie is for you.
1400069289|5.0|I'm someone who has spent a lifetime transitioning from one change through another.  Involuntary changes and voluntary alike.  Understanding how our brains use habit patterns to dictate a large portion of our daily lives was extremely interesting to me and opened a door to how I approach things in daily life.  As a former smoker (since January 1, 2009) I can attest to the frustration and temptation that habit can sometimes require we suffer through in order to learn a new way to cope with significant changes.  Somehow understanding why we have these constant triggers takes the irritation out of it a little.  Understanding how habits are formed and altered gives you more control to re-shape those parts of your life that you want most to refine.  Well researched, written in an entertaining and easy to understand manner.
B004W89N72|5.0|This is a great app for people with who are very neat and have a lot of work to do.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is very addictive. I find myself worrying over the state of my fictional cabbages and carrots. I wonder what wonderful things I could contribute to the world were I not tending my make-believe crops.
B000RJW1Y2|3.0|I bought the Thrustmaster Universal 5-in-1 Wheel a couple of months ago mainly for my PC and PS2 (Need for Speed World and Gran Turismo 4).<br />When it first came in the box, it looked a bit small and badly made. The plastic of the steering wheel looked like it was about to split in half and the pedals were very small and felt unstable. Even the connector between the pedals and the wheel looked like it was falling apart.<br />It was really simple to set up. You just connected the pedals to the wheel itself, and connected the wheel to your gaming device. It has a Gamecube, PS2 and USB connector (which you can use for Gamecube controller compatible games on the Wii like Mario Kart and for the PS3 and other systems that support USB controllers), and it's just plug-and-play, without software.<br />It worked perfectly on the PC game Need for Speed World (you do have to configure it using the \\"Set up USB controllers\\" option on Windows 7, but after that it works fine). It also worked with Mario Kart Wii fine, but there's no variable acceleration/braking because the game doesn't support it; it's either on or off. It was compatible with Gran Turismo 4, but there was some glitch with the pedals that I couldn't solve where it would appear as full-throttle on the game when you half-pressed the accelerator. In short, if you physically pressed the accelerator 50%, the game would assume the accelerator is fully pressed.<br />In general, the steering resistance is way off. The more you steer, the more the resistance, so it's almost impossible to judge how much you're actually turning it.<br />Again, I've been using the wheel occasionally for the past couple of months, and it's served my purpose as a casual controller in games where the keyboard is simply too inaccurate. It looks and feels cheap, but it hasn't broken yet (touch wood). As long as you're gentle with it, it should probably last.

0439023513|4.0|I finished reading the 3rd book this morning and I am still processing my feelings. I thought was painfully honest and real. In the end I am glad she ended up with Peeta and no Katniss did not have a fairy tale ending but how could she after everything she'd been through? Those kind of traumas one can never fully recover from. The entire book was so believable. Many reviews I have read have unfairly complared this triology to Harry Potter and Twilight. Harry Potter was just as tragic and believable. I think the Hunger Games beats Twilight because this love triangle was so much more believable and painful and it took second place to the war story, Bella got her happy ending where as Katniss got a realistic one. Yes there were flaws, many in-fact but in the end it was great ending to a series I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finish. I read all 3 in 3 days.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|What can one say about Mark Twain?  The book is as delightful as I recall from reading it many years ago.  I was prompted to read it as part of a community read program here in Boise, ID.  Lots of discussions, presentations, contests, etc. accompanied this annual event.  Tom, Huck, Becky and the others never fail to entertain and calls us back to the seemingly carefree days of boyhood.  Perhaps they weren't as carefree as our memories or Tom's exploits suggest.  My Kindle Fire was a perfect way to enjoy this American Classic all over again.  Thanks Amazon for making it so quick and easy.

B004GYY714|5.0|I was \\"Blown Away\\" by this free app. As a big radio & broadcasting fan, the price (or lack of it) has no bearing on my opinion. Like most people, I think, it's common to trash our local radio selection(s). Never again. After just one day, it has been a sea change for me. A whole new world opens up and I've only begun to discover the awesome diversity offered here. So much, that I predict my T.V. gets a rest.<br /><br />The nuts & bolts: I got \\"TuneIn Radio\\" free for my Kindle Fire. I will stay with it for now, as I've read the \\"Pro's\\" only advantage is the recording feature. And it does not work. I ran the \\"free\\" app for much of one day, so far. I had no problems. Zero. This thing ran smooth as aged Kentucky Whiskey. It opens quickly & fast to follow commands. Navagation is easy enough. I like that you can scroll up & down (and) slide panels off screen to either side. Again, all without delays, kinks, or hang ups. With \\"TuneIn Radio\\" I have no regrets. It is, in fact, the very best use of space I've got. An app that is my favorite bar none.(Note)- I would have installed \\"I Heart Radio\\" weeks ago, had it not been coupled with \\"Facebook\\" which I don't know what it means, really. I just wanted a stand alone app.<br /><br />UPDATE- (Oct.30,2013)  I did opt for the \\"Pro\\" version. The advantage is no adds.<br />I've also learned the difference between this and \\"I Heart Radio\\" is the later<br />covers Clear Channel nationally. I use this for just one specific show. While<br />I use \\"TuneIn Radio Pro\\" for everything else. And let me say, I can spend many<br />enjoyable hours listening. There is a huge amount of spoken word content. Podcasts<br />of every description, NPR, PRI,BBC,audio books, Comedy, and on & on. It really<br />is the superior radio app. This is what you're looking for.
B0031RS69G|4.0|It's a warm, happy piece of fantasy that all Sci - fy fans must read, and every literature aficionado should know. The writing in particular is really strong.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book opened new horizons on Steve Jobs. He was depicted from different sides. His personality indeed is deep and colorful.
B006OAB432|2.0|I like this album a lot, so I pre-ordered the vinyl version. I listened to the first 3 tracks but had to stop because the skipping on tracks 2 and 3 was really bad (\\"Some Nights\\" and \\"We Are Young\\"). I exchanged it with a new copy (Amazon was really good about that--the new copy came within 2 days of my filing for an exchange). I just listened to the new copy, and it has the same problem as the first, so I am just going to stick with the CD version. My only complaint is with the quality of the vinyl version--I like the album itself.
B002RHGYOA|5.0|From page 1 i was entranced! It is so addictive you can't put it down...i hear some negative comments for reviews usually saying other books are so unrealistic...well it is fiction! But this book could just as easily be plausible. Stieg Larsson tells a story where you can try to guess what will happen - and you'll always be wrong because it's so original. I am so glad i picked up on this trilogy and recommend it to anyone that likes a real story and not just the same old stuff 'writers' churn out that blends all into the same cliche's. This book however, isn't for people who like light and fluffy pieces...this is the real stuff.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|People that went to the movies and saw this that didn't like how violent the movie was is not the problem of everyone else that did. If you didn't know what the movie was about walking into it that's your own fault for not reading. Yes its violent yes its over the top and yes its freaking ridicules but thats the exactly what its supposed to be and they nailed it!! Its not a history lesson nor something you will learn from unless you want to see what happens when a God hits a human being in the head with a hammer with \\"God like speed\\" The results are quite surprising :) Anyways, watch and enjoy if you liked 300 or over the top action movies and I'm certain you will love this one too.

B001P3SA94|5.0|The other reviewers have done an amazing job here of summarizing Cadillac Records, the story of the Chess Record Label in the 1950's.<br /><br />If you want to understand the blues, race and the dirty economics of the music business during the era, this film is the perfect place to start. You'll see great drama, and learn much about Chicago blues, the prototype for rock and roll that far too few modern  listeners understand.<br /><br />See it!
0142410373|3.0|Matilda by Roald Dahl is about a small, sweet girl who is a genius. She deals with over-exaggerated bullies in her parents and the headmistress of her school. Her father is a used car salesman who thinks females are dumb and only useful in the kitchen. Her mother believes a girl should focus on being pretty to catch a man. Both her parents love TV and hate books. While the headmistress is a giant of a bully, Matilda finds a confidant in her teacher Miss Jennifer Honey.<br /><br />The plot is slow-moving and I think ends rather abruptly but overall it was ok and slightly amusing. Some reviewers complained the adults were too idiotic and overly abusive. In my own experience this is typical of British literature. Yes, the characters tend to be one-dimensional, but this is a children's book published several years ago. For those who complained it was unbelievable--it is a fantasy, it's not meant to be believable.<br /><br />This won't make my list of favorites but I would still consider it a contender for classic in British children's literature.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Loved the book. As a runner with bad feet, this was just what I needed! This book may have saved me from years of painful running and more poor medical evaluations. After a very enjoyable read I have ventured into barefoot an Vibram five fingers running and in a month I can already feel the difference in my feet! Read this book if you are a runner or if not just be amazed by the unbelievable ultra athletes this book tells about. If you like it, follow it up with a couple of barefoot instructional books and off you go!

B000X1Z0BU|1.0|This film \\"Once\\" has got to be one of the worst that I have viewed in years!  How John Carney, the writer/director was ever able to get this out into the market for sale, I do not know.  It is absolute trash and the players are terrible.  Thus music is absolute garbage.....far too loud and \\"grating\\" on the nerves!  Need I say more....or less.<br /><br />I have two options:  Ask for a refund, or throw this DVD of \\"Once\\" right into the garbage!
B0016492BW|5.0|This is the funniest movie ever... period.<br /><br />My wife would not agree.  Maybe it's a guy-thing.<br /><br />Hey Amazon - negative reviews from 12 years ago are not helpful. Can't you purge the reviews after so long?
156224003X|5.0|There was always such a wall between me and the masters.  I figured I was inherently less talented and needed to practice eight hours/day (while practicing practically zero).  I had no road map for practicing and it would become an arduous unpleasant experience (hence I would avoid it).  Kenny Werner does an excellent job of building a foundation and philosophy for being great, and stresses the fact we are already great.  I also study Tibetan Buddhism and this was in alignment with that philosophy.  Essentially a goalless way eases tension of \\"making it' or learning endless pieces but half-assed.  A must read for any musician who is not quite sure what is holding them back or why they even play in the first place.  This book is not for the analytical mind!
0307949486|1.0|After wasting my time reading 200 pages and still having that feeling like the book was going nowhere i decided to post this review. Trust me when i say the background story is excruciating to read. I still didnt make it through it and i wont be. Every other author I've read at least tries to hook you in prior to being halfway done.  Horrible, simply put.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a decent read but the first 2 are better!  Still worth finishing up the series to get the closure that I wanted.
B004FOA84A|3.0|The game is too simple. There's nothing that really need you to think or spend more time to solve, which makes me a bit disappointed. And the game is really short, I finished it in 30-40 minutes..
B004XNGKBS|5.0|I bought the pro version for my Kindle Fire and have the free versions on my Android phone and Acer tablet. It is so nice to be able to quickly open the notepad and actually write a quick note without having to hunt out tiny keys or special characters.  In most cases, it's a much faster way to take down the information.I need, and can e-mail the image instantly if needed. Best if you use a stylus but a fingertips is just as well taken. Easy to customize, organize and edit notes.  Would recommend Handwrite over any other similar app available.

0316017930|5.0|The book Outliers by Malcom Gladwell is a very well written book. Just by the title of the book, you can kind of figure out what it's going to be about. It's going to be about \\"Outliers\\". In the book, Gladwell does a very good job of catching your attention on why people are successful and why it makes them an outlier. He goes to explain what makes a successful hockey player to how Bill Gates hit the jackpot in Microsoft. Before reading this book, I thought these people were successful because they were given a gift, but Gladwell changed my thought on that. Malcom not only changed my thoughts on success, but has changed the way I go on to be successful myself. This book can open your eyes in many ways, were you can strive to be successful. I would recommend this book to anyone. Whether you're a student, or just someone looking for something to read. Gladwell makes it easy to comprehend so that it can be read by anyone. Normally I am not a fan of reading books, but I have to say, the book Outliers, is one of the better books that I have read in a long time. That's why I am recommending that not only you should read it, but also that everyone should read it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Hard to put down once you get started. You get drawn into the characters and the intricate story line. Lisbeth's personality and her relationship with Blomqvist are fascinating.  Couldn't wait to follow the progression from one book to the next.

B005M2A4D4|5.0|Beware of pirated / inferior copies!<br />Look at the pictures posted here, and see if the item you received matches!<br /><br />The DVD holders on the inside should be DARK BLUE.<br />There should be inserts!<br />If the DVD holders are held together by what appears to be packing tape, you probably have a forgery!<br />The fake DVDs also only hold 5GB.

B001PPLJIQ|3.0|Personally I prefer movies that inspire and motivate people. The Reader is certainly not a feel good movie. It tells a story of some unusual choices people make and the consequences they will have to face. I feel sorry for the ignorance of Hanna and the false attachment of young Michael to her. I feel angry and sad about Hanna's indifference to other people's suffering - she was probably already drowning in her own pain. It's frustrating to see the grown Michael carrying the burden of his memory with Hanna which affects his family.<br />It's terribly wrong (if we don't talk about the law here) to take advantage of minors, whether it's a girl or a boy, by manipulation or physical force. Young people aren't given the same social power in a grown-up society, nor are they equipped with the wisdom to cope with being both emotionally and sexually overpowered. Not enough weight on this point in the movie.... maybe hinted in the brief screen time between Michael and his daughter, and his conversation with the holocaust servicer.<br />I wonder why Hanna actually kills herself in the end - Is she ashamed of what she did, or because she is ashamed of how she looks in front of Michael?  The director put the camera mostly on the parts of when Hanna appears to be somewhat pitiful and distant.  But when I take a deeper look into what she has actually done, it's really hard to forgive her, despite of the possibility of her unfortunate childhood to cause her illiterate or some past abusive relationships with men which make her a control freak. However, a little bit of mercy can still be given to the sorriest souls.... For this reason, The Reader is still worth watching.
1250006341|5.0|Only one word comes to mind when describing \\"The World of Downton Abbey\\" - sumptuous!!  If you are a fan of the brilliant PBS series, then you will love this book.  It is not only filled with gorgeous photos of the cast and Highclere Castle, the setting for the story, but it also contains interesting and informative back-story about the era of \\"Downton Abbey\\".  Subjects range from fashion, life in service, family life, and romance to houses and estates and World War 1.  It's the definitive companion book to the series and something to tide you over during the long wait for Series 3!!

1442419814|4.0|This was a dystopian, taking place in a world where everyone was `Pretty.' Becoming pretty was as simple as a medical procedure immediately after a sixteenth birthday. Until then, everyone was an Ugly, no matter what they looked like. When Tally's new friend Shay ran away to The Smoke, Tally had to track her down and turn her in or she would have ended up Ugly for life. I found the plot to be unique and thought Westerfield presented it in an interesting way. He made it seem like this was a normal way of life for these people, not just some weird science experiment.<br /><br />The dialogue was different, though not hard to follow. There was a lot of invented slang (i.e. crumblies, middles, littlies) and futuristic things (i.e. hoverboards and bungee jackets) but the basics were easy to get. The kids didn't have much respect for the authority figures in their lives and it showed in the way they spoke. The characters weren't remarkable or even unlikable. They were just...average. Tally was desperate to become Pretty and I found her level of commitment to having the procedure a little over the top. Although, in a world where this was simply the norm, that made sense. Shay and Peris were underutilized, I thought. I never really learned much about Shay or why she chose to join The Smoke. Peris was almost a noncharacter and I didn't understand why Tally wanted to join him so very badly. I thought David was the most complete character in the book, and he was also my favorite.<br /><br />There was a bit of romance and I thought it was realistic and sweet. There were lots of adventures and plenty of action, mostly after Shay disappeared and Tally set off to find her. The trigger that led to the final battle was so predictable, I didn't appreciate that. As soon as it happened, I thought \\"Well, that was stupid. That's going to end badly.\\"<br /><br />I liked the narrator okay. Her voice was slightly grainy sounding, but I got used to it quickly. I liked that she didn't try too hard to make the male voices sound low. Sometimes that can really backfire but she just lowered her pitch a tiny bit and I thought it was perfect.<br /><br />The cover is fairly unremarkable, not giving away anything or hinting at what the book could be about.<br /><br />As reviewed on [...].ces sound low.

B00003CX95|3.0|Because I know this isn't going to go over well.<br /><br />`Braveheart' is one of those movies that has garnered an impassioned following of supposed cinephiles who are convinced of this film's eternal greatness and hold it in high esteem and consider no fault to be had with regard to its greatness.  It doesn't help that these same devotees usually site it alongside `Forrest Gump' in terms of its greatness and thus lose my overall attention since I can't take that film and its fans seriously.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />But I'm getting off on the wrong foot here.  I don't want this to come across like a middle finger pointed straight at all the five star reviewers here, so I'll try and reword this.  I have found that this film is very popular to those who are told it is great because it won so many Oscars and confuse its epic scope for actual quality.  `Braveheart' is very pretty to look at.  The cinematography is superb and from a technical standpoint, the film still sends chills.  The battle scenes are beautifully cut.  The costumes and production design are stellar.  The score is rapturous when needed (a tad overdone in parts to be honest though) and Mel Gibson's direction can be confused for great because on the outset it appears like he's done a technically savvy job (although I truly account most of the films visual grace to the film editing and cinematography over Gibson's rather clich&eacute;d direction).<br /><br />Still, at the heart of this movie is an emotionally vapid presentation that is masked over by standard heart swelling `root for the underdog' camaraderie and is utterly littered with horrific acting that only bogs down the film's overall impact.<br /><br />This script is just BAD.<br /><br />One thing that I noted rather heavily was the way that Gibson really tried to portray William Wallace as a variation of Jesus Christ himself.  The way he visualizes the man (especially after his capture) is very symbolic and almost tasteless in parts.  In fact, the way that Gibson visualizes this film as a whole is rather distasteful.  There are heavy demeaning elements that bleed forth from Gibson's obvious personal feelings (the film is subtlety sexist and not so subtlety bigoted) and this can at times become overwhelming.  Look at the portrayal of the homosexual Prince.  The first half of the film is no better than a soap opera (those glances are grossly over exaggerated and they do not instill a feeling of love but one of cheesy fabricated emotions).<br /><br />I've debated this a thousand times with my friends.  `Gladiator', while heavily influenced by this film, trumps it by a hundred fold for the simple reason that Ridley Scott understood how to craft a film that felt organic and honest as opposed to vapidly misleading.<br /><br />And Russell Crowe's soulful portrayal of Maximus is leagues above the self-promotion that Gibson lathers all over William.<br /><br />It is technically beautiful, and Sophie Marceau is not only stunning but she delivers a marvelous performance that is too good to be a part of this overrated fluff.  Still, `Braveheart' is not a good film; like at all.<br /><br />And that ending is ridiculous.t, the way that Gibson visualizes this film as a whole is rather distasteful.

B002BX4VEK|5.0|Thank you for this great Elvis C.D. I have searched long and hard for this C.D. Again, this is a special C.D. for me. Some dealers are just to high priced.You came across for me. Fantastic!  Thank You.  Best Regards.
B000ZOXDFA|2.0|I don't have much to say here so I'm going to try something new.  I'm going to use a single sentence to convey my thoughts on each facet of this film.<br /><br />The Script:<br />A confused history lesson delves into campy soap operatic tones that snuff out the more interesting bits.<br /><br />The Direction:<br />A total step backward from its grittier 1998 predecessor, Kapur tries to add too much gloss and loses his core along the way.<br /><br />The Acting:<br />Clive Owen is a joke, Abbie Cornish can't act, Cate Blanchett is shocking bland and unfocused and Samantha Morton steals the whole show with a handful of scenes (she's amazing).<br /><br />The Technical:<br />Some overblown visuals look cheesy and fake, but the costumes are divine and the texture of the set pieces are organic and splendid to look at.<br /><br />In the end I hope that they stop here.  I loved the 1998 film, and Blanchett in it, but this was a disaster that failed on nearly every level, the Oscar winning costumes aside.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|Thank you for this great Elvis C.D. at a fabulous price! I have been searching long and hard for this particular C.D. You had it at a price I couldn't refuse. To own this,means a great deal to me. ELVIS,the greatest entertainer the world will ever know!!!  Thank You. Best Regards,  Gary.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Castle consistently delivers entertaining stories, funny lines and great ensemble cast action.  So what if the costumers put Detective Kate Beckett in high heels no cop would EVER be wearing on the job? So what if its hysterical that the writers think we're going to buy the fact that 1)She kicked a door down and 2)She did it in the aforementioned high heels?  And don't even get me started on her artfully tousled hair/perfect and fairly heavy eye makeup. Its FUN! Period.  In this season a long-running plot point gets a little more resolution, and more than one major character takes a major bullet.  Castle delivers nice full seasons of episodes (other than their first abbreviated season due to the writer's strike) unlike the team over at Bones which seems to have gotten too famous to actually put shows out much to my disappointment.  Highly recommend this series!
B0071MV540|4.0|I honestly didn't know what to expect, because the trailer really didn't do it justice. All the characters we're played right, they all had their back story for what time allowed was mostly shown. I think some parts were over played, or to detailed and some not enough. Example; the restaurant, with the roach. But overall I recommend it, it has the comedy that Ben, and Eddie are known for. But also keeps the seriousness of the situation. If you haven't enjoyed movies by these two before. You may not like this, for it keeps along of the line of their humor that they've shown in other movies.
0307959856|4.0|I bought this for my wife, and our daughter came to visit for a few days just when it arrived.  Both read it, loved it and talked about it.  They're wondering if PD James will write a sequel to this sequel.  They hope so.
B004W89N72|3.0|I really like the look and feel of this app. So much that I would like to use it instead of the stock calendar. But without a widget, which all calendars should have, even though it syncs with the stock.
0061245097|5.0|So many things about this series totally makes me all giddy! First there is Cat. I have said it before and I will say it again, I LURVE heroines that can kick ass and take charge! Cat doesn't think twice about doing what she has to to protect herself and the ones that she loves! She gets the job done and does it well..even better than the strongest man! Girl power! (yeah I hate that phrase too but damn does she do it well!)<br /><br />Second, Bones. Oh my dear sweet lord is Bones an awesome character! I love his swagger. He has everything that you need to make a great hero. He's strong, loyal, and dead sexy! Seriously, if Cat WASN'T romantically attracted to him, I would have thrown the book across the room! The two of them have wonderful chemistry and they make a powerful couple. I think they qualify as my favorite book couple.<br /><br />I loved this book! I can't wait til I can read the next one

B0041KKYBA|5.0|I first viewed the production on TV.  Both  my wife and myself were so impressed we recommended it to most of our online friends and acquaintances. As a follow up we purchased a copy.  The first portion of the production deals with the background of  characters  who got our country into the financial mess we are now in and how they did it during the Clinton and Bush administrations.<br />  The last portion really makes the adrenalin flow.  It reveals that Obama administration stacked  our treasury, and banking institutions with the very same blackguards. The summery, left to the viewer is quite clear.  That is we are living in the final decades of the \\"late great United States of America\\".

0385523386|4.0|I'll never forget the first time I walked into the prison I call home 8 hours a day.  It was a warm spring morning in central California. I showed my id at the entrance, followed the crowd through an open gate.  It slid shut behind us as another one opened.  I followed through not sure what to expect, the second gate slamed shut after we passed.  Two large chain-linked fences ran parallel to each other around the entire prison. Each with large looped bobwire on top as to prevent someone from climbing over.  In between the two fences runs an electric fence.  If touched by any living thing it is sure to bring death.  I do this five days a week.  I know as I enter I will be leaving at the end of my work day.  In Piper Kerman's book ORANGE IS THE NEW BLACK she takes the reader inside the prison walls of a Federal prison with an illustration so real you feel as though you are there.  It is deep, honest, heart felt and true.  As an RN working in the prison system in California I can so clearly visulaize her experience.  Piper's story is not a soft, easy story to read.  It is real.  I thank her for sharing her story, her life, the most painfully dark part of her self with her readers.  As a person who has the freedom to walk out of prison daily, Piper reminds me to remember those who cannot.  I'm glad to see it through the eyes of someone from the inside looking out. I recommend this book.
1612130283|4.0|This book was a very entertaining read.  I have read all three books and am looking forward to the next book in the series.<br /><br />If you are looking for \\"Henry James\\" - don't bother with the series; These are books that will transport you into the the \\"Fantasy of Fifty\\".  I mean, come on, how many books have you read that the H nickname is \\"Fifty\\".<br /><br />I did not want the story to end.  Ana and Christian - wow, I admire that girl.  Love conquers all?  I loved the e-mails.  What a nice twist - I went back and read them again AND<br />of course I looked up the music mentioned to hear what they were hearing - it was ALL GOOD TO ME (sorry, I didn't mean to get shouty)...

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this recently to hold my growing lens collection and new Canon 60D camera.  It includes ample pockets for storage inside the compartment and on the outside.  The camera and lens storage is customizable to fit your lenses alone or attached to the camera just like the more expensive \\"Canon\\" bag.  I could fit my camera with lens attached plus a 70-300mm, a 50mm, and a wide angle with more room to add another smaller lens.  There are straps on the outside to hold your water bottle, rolled fold-up deflector or whatever you may need.  I trust this bag to keep my camera and lenses secure while they're waiting to be used.
0525478817|4.0|I read \\"Looking for Alaska\\" recently and I kept seeing this book on the best sellers list so I figured I'd read it next. Oh my god... and I thought Looking for Alaska was sad.<br /><br />I'm a big cry-baby and cry during like every book I read and every movie I watch but I think even the most stoic reader is going to cry. It's well written and interesting and engaging. I couldn't stop reading it. But it's also deeply tragic and unfair and you will feel so terrible.
B006QKJQ12|4.0|Good movie enjoyed by my 13 and 14 y/o children.  They found it entertaining and they said it would be worth watching again.
0439813786|5.0|This is such a wonderful book! I discovered it with my grandson, and loved the way the pictures advance the narrative in the same way storyboards are used for film.  I have purchased many copies as gifts, but always tell young people as well as their parents to read the book before seeing the movie, as they will appreciate so much more the tender way Martin Scorsese brought the book to the big screen!! (Ha, \\"tender\\" & \\"Scorsese\\" don't usually come to mind at the same time\\" do they? )

This app is good for the starter but not for me. Cant sync and no widgets associated with this app. Staying with GO calendar for now.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It shows about a dozen garbage videos to choose from, none of which I had any interest in whatsoever. There is no way to search for anything, nothing like on a computer. What you see is what you get and that is all, a lousy dozen pieces of foolish infantile junk, that I did not watch or download. Useless on the Fire.

B0015346OM|5.0|This is a great book. I saw the movie, which I enjoyed, but the book is just like being there. The book informs you of everything that is going on. This information gives you a real feel for the horror of war and how quickly things can change..and go from bad to worse. A really good book, would highly recommend, and I am not a war book kinda gal.

B007H51DQG|5.0|Season 1 was absolutely amazing, but we all know the first season is usually the best. Don't complain too much or they will cancel the show altogether and replace it with something that won't even have a good first season. Yes, it would be lovely if they would continue to follow the example set by the first season, but it is still a really good show. Very few television shows or movies ever manage to make such a laughed at topic (zombies) good and this show went way beyond good. The Walking Dead brings a real-life twist on to the zombie flick and it's original.<br /><br />Yes, the second season is slower than the first, and of course there are going to be things done that a person would never do in real life, but that's how they make the characters' lives less about laundry and cooking and sitting around waiting and more about the things that make good television - action and adventure. I would honestly prefer a few more unrealistic plot turns to make things more interesting. But the show is still highly interesting- you just have to wait a little more for the parts that make you watch and won't let you go. They are still there, just more spread out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app, it is awesome.  You can read different versions of the Bible and also choose from a huge number of reading and devotional plans. You can also listen to the Bible and download some Bible versions onto your kindle for free. I highly recommend this app!

B003WMX3SY|4.0|I bought this case for my first build. I'm only using fans for cooling but I have no problems. I am in dusty Arizona and I have a cat and I don't have issues with dust inside the case, but I do collect some on the outside front. All my fans are oriented inwards the way the case was designed. I haven't put any extras in yet but there is plenty of room for more of them. It looks as if a water cooling system would be super easy to add. According to the AI Suite II temperature gauges from my mobo it stays cool. Just for the record, I never shut down my pc, I always have a game and a lot of other things running and never get over heated. I have an I7 2600k CPU,a Asus p67 TUF mobo, a single Ge Force 560ti and a single WD 500 Gig hard drive. I have tons of space for a second graphics card, extra hard drives and optical drives and fans and any other way I want to grow my rig.  For a first time builder this case was really handy because I could get to what I needed at any angle. In the future I want to switch the positions of some of my components.That is the joy of this case I can rearrange things in minutes. I would agree with other users the hard drive mounted on bungee cords worries me a little, but I don't really move the case around a lot. I bought this case for the look, the ease of installation and the cool handles on top. I travel for a living and prefer a pc to a laptop so this is as portable as a desktop case gets. I guess more savvy builders would say there is an issue with cable management just because it is so open there isn't much of a place to hide cables and I would agree. If I had to suggest improvement I think most people would like to see some kind of dust filters for it and most aren't crazy about the bungee cords or lack of hiding spaces for cables. It's also not quite as lightweight as it looks. The look is also just not for everyone. It kind of reminds me of something built from a Lego set and an erector set. I'm happy with it and won't be trading itin any time soon.. not that I could, since it tends to break the bank.
B0036CYKQE|5.0|If you're anything like me, you were heartbroken to learn that dollhouse had been canceled. It is my all-time favorite series. I wish more people would have known how great it is. Well, its too late now. But unlike so many canceled shows before this one, this one actually had a proper ending, which this is. For that I am grateful as so many networks often give their audience no respect by leaving them hanging. This series is great and if you can get over the first few episodes, which are great, but somewhat in a case by case bubble rather than a full storyline episodes, you will be set. This series is great and I cannot tell you how great it is, you will just have to find that out for yourself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is amazing so easy to use I'm sorry it took.me so long to upload it...it is a fantastically easy reference and offers many daily reading plans....there is no reason not to add it to ur kindle.  I use it more than my actual Bible<br />  God bless the creative team

B0041D843M|5.0|Campbell has assembled a detailed and comprehensive study of how American's are killing themselves with what they eat.  He consolidates multiple credible research results from a wide variety of sources, conducted over decades of time, including his own in-depth research in China and elsewhere to support his conclusions. Shockingly, he demonstrates to the reader that the interests of our food manufacturers, the medical care establishment, big pharma, the beef, pork, poultry and dairy industries have supported a diet for Americans that causes and prolongs a wide variety of diseases in America.<br /><br />This is a must read for anyone who either wants to save themselves, their children, or their loved ones from the ravages of disease after disease.<br /><br />Warning:  Some times the book is a detailed read.  Necessarily so, though, as the writer takes on almost every preconcieved notion you likely have about diet.  The detail is needed to reverse the brain-washing you've already had at the hands of the people who are poisoning you so they can profit!

B002PMV9FG|4.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Widescreen Edition) is the sixth film in the Harry Potter series and was first on the screen in 2009. Even though the film clocks in at 147 minutes, I feel that it could have been at least an hour longer to fully retain all the twists and turns that are contained in the book. This might come in an extended edition in the future. Still if one compares it with the rushed through Order of the phoenix, this is much better in many ways. Watson, Radclife and Grint are superb in their roles and I honestly can not wait to see the final two films in this remarkable fantasy world. Bravo Rowling! As for this film, I give it a medium 4 out of 5. 4/5.
B000077VR3|4.0|This is not meant as a disparaging remark about the cinematic quality of this film.  However, that being said, I had quite the time keeping up while the film vacillated between scenes of trippy show tunes and well handled French breasts.

FRANCE HAS PROVED THAT AGAIN WITH \\"THE ARTIST\\" AND THE MUSIC SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS 'SILENT' FILM IS JUST A EXCELLENT AS THE PICTURE!! THE MUSIC HAS AN AMERICAN 'FEEL' AND TONE TO IT - IF THIS WERE AN AMERICAN FILM, YES, IT WOULD STILL BE GREAT, BUT SINCE IT IS EUROPEAN, THE PRODUCERS AND CREW HAVE DONE A GREAT SERVICE TO CREATING AN ENTERTAINING PIECE THAT WILL LAST A VERY, VERY LONG TIME IN THE MIND AND IN THE 'CLASSIC' FILM LIBRARY. ALL THE ACTORS 'SPEAK' ENGLISH AND ALL 'TITLES CARDS', LOCATIONS AND EVEN SOME OF THE ACTORS THEMSELVES ARE ENGLISH AMERICAN. EVEN THE FRENCH LEAD ACTOR AND THE ARGENTINA LEAD ACTRESS 'MOUTH' THEIR WORDS IN ENGLISH. IT COULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE, WITH CARELESS FRENCH-SPEAK AND CHEEZY FAKE LOCALES TO EMULATE LOS ANGELES/HOLLYWOOD SETTINGS. IT DESERVED THE 'BEST PICTURE' TROPHY. COUNTRIES LEARN FROM OTHERS AND SOME, GET IT RIGHT. VIVA LE 'ARTIST'!! . . . IMITATION - A FORM OF FLATTERY? THIS WORKS!<br /><br />THE FILM MUSIC IS ALSO ROOTED IN THE 1920'S 'JAZZ AGE' STYLE. GOOD ARRANGEMENTS AND GOOD MOOD ENHANCING MELODICS SET TO CERTAIN 'SCENES' IN THE MOVIES BEING CREATED AT THE 'STUDIO' OUR SILENT MAIN CHARACTER IS ACTING AT. WELL DONE!<br /><br />I DO QUESTION A MUSIC PIECE 'LIFTED' FROM THE HITCHCOCK FILM \\"VERTIGO\\" BY COMPOSER BERNARD HERRMANN. NOTICED IT RIGHT OFF. IT WORKS, BUT 'ARTIST' COMPOSER SHOULD HAVE USED HIS OWN CREATION TO DEVELOP THAT SCENE. HERRMANN'S MUSIC IS NOT ON THE SOUNDTRACK. I WONDER IF ANYONE ELSE PICKED UP ON THAT SEGMENT??

006197806X|4.0|Pandemonium is an improvement on the series in many ways but also weaker than the first book, Delirium in many ways. I\\"ll just dive right into this:<br /><br />Improvements: Lauren Oliver definitely stepped up the pace and the action in this one. The story is split between Lena's past (what happens directly after the ending of Delirium) and her present and both storylines are equally compelling although at opposite times. What I mean by this, is her past storyline is really fascinating in the first half then beings to lag and her present storyline lags in the first half but really picks up in the second.<br /><br />Lauren's action scenes got a lot better this time and quite frankly I think the \\"present\\" storyline was really well thought-out complete with intrigue, mystery, suspense, great fight scenes and even romance. I liked the new characters, Raven and Julian especially and I really liked that Lauren switched the setting from Portland, ME to be in the \\"Wilds\\" but also New York City.<br /><br />Weaknesses: Even though the overall storyline was compelling, I found some aspects of this book irritating. For instance, Lauren used the word \\"twittering\\" at least three times. Either that's just bad writing or bad editing but either way I rolled my eyes everytime I read that word. But it also wasn't just that word, I found myself eyerolling a few times with her prose. In Delirium, Oliver's writing was poetic, unique, stark and at times beautiful and it overall felt effortless. But with Pandemonium, it felt like she was forcing it a little too much - she used really odd metaphors that just made no sense and sounded extremely fake in my opinion. She also seemed to focus on retelling us useless information over and over again like how hungry or cold Lena was.....we get it, enough already!<br /><br />I also couldn't help but draw many comparisons during the \\"past\\" storyline to The Hunger Games. Lots of survival in the woods, emerging from the brink of death, fighting. I appreciate those elements, but Suzanne Collins just does it better than Lauren Oliver, so if I were Lauren I probably would have focused less on this.<br /><br />Anyways, overall I thought this was a strong follow up to Delirium, certainly no \\"sophomore slump\\" here which was good. Will definitely be checking out the third in the trilogy to see how the story ends!eciate those elements, but Suzanne Collins just does it better than Lauren Oliver, so if I were Lauren I probably would have focused less on this.<br /><br />Anyways, overall I thought this was a strong follow up to Delirium, certainly no \\"sophomore slump\\" here which was good.

Deep issues are explored, such as, \\"Is it right to murder innocent children, even if it looks cool on T.V.?\\" The plot is innane, and the characters are absurd.The best thing about it was that it was free.

140120841X|5.0|V for Vendetta is a classic in his medium (graphic novels). It's subversive and entertaining at the same time. If you love reading and visual arts and literature that makes you think, this book is a must-have classic. The paper is soft and the size is quite good. I'm nearsighted and I didn't find any difficult to read (I tried reading on my iPad and I couldn't because the letters were too small). It's a good edition.
B0052GACNM|5.0|This is a great recording of Jazz standards.  Mr. Bennett's voice is as smooth as silk.  At 85 years of age, he's still great!<br /><br />The duets with Queen Latifa (who knew she could sing jazz like this?!), Lady Gaga and Faith Hill are all beautiful The duet with Amy Winehaus is particularly moving.<br /><br />The low spot on the recording is the tune with Aretha Franklin.  Never did like her.  A high school friend of mine used to call her Urethra Franklin.<br /><br />Buy this disk!

B005ONTD42|5.0|When I first heard of this robotic ball, I had to go to the Sphero website and check it out. Seemed like a pretty cool device--part robot, part ball--so I picked one up from Amazon. Although I've only put Sphero to the test over the past three weeks, it gets better with each and every run. First, you get better at driving the sucker over time. Second, everyone wants to play with Sphero. You see, I teach at a school and during frees, I've been taking Sphero out for test drives. I let him loose down the hallway and watch the kids' reactions--they are totally freaked out at first. They can't figure out why this colored ball is there, (I am using bright green for St. Patty's Day right now although you can program it to be any color you'd like) how it is moving, and why the sucker can do circles around them! Once the kids see that I am controlling the ball on my phone, they are totally blown away!<br /><br />Although these high schoolers are tech savvy, they've never seen anything like Sphero. Kids have downloaded the free Apps on their own phones and now they're taking Sphero for a \\"walk\\" during their free periods. I plan to break out mini cones and let them race each other against the clock. When enough of the kids get savvy with their driving, we plan to have the first of many Sphero drive offs as a kid already said he would buy a second one to help out with our antics. I think I'll set up brackets just like they do for March Madness and crown a champion. This is gonna be good!

0143119680|1.0|So here I am, about four c.d.s into the audio book, and I thoughtI would take a look at the reviews, and, naturally, I wanted to look at the negative reviews, and lo and behold!, I find all of the remarks I would make echoed,and no sign that things are going to get better, so I am going to bail on this book and find something better to occupy the time in my long commute. Every one of these reviewers is right: the book is long, the characters are superficial. Diana Bishop is everything I have gotten so tired of in the Scarpetta novels: a superwoman deeply wracked with self doubt, as if flaws are what makes people interesting. HEY AUTHORS! Flaws are what make people tiresome and obnoxious to deal with! When I make friends with someone it's because all of the terrific aspects of their personalities make their flaws trivial, not because the train wreck they present makes me want to be around to mop up after them.<br /><br />And vampires: Kostova had it exactly right, they are re-animated corpses that feed on the blood of the living. As she and Bram Stoker wrote, they are repellant at an instinctual level. They are not dark, brooding metrosexuals swooning about like Lord Byron!<br /><br />And lastly, some readers (and yes, I am one of them) can remember facts about characters from one chapter to the next. So it REALLY wrankles when you say that your vampire pool-boy just holds the tea cup because he doesn't drink...tea; or that he sits and watches you plough your way through a hessian washer-womans's breakfast and doesn't eat a bite because he doesn't eat...food, and then, a chapter or two later he is sitting down for wine, soup, and chess with his (obligatorily gay) daemon friend! Hey lady! How about some consistency?<br /><br />If you want a really good historical fiction based around \\"real\\" witches, check out \\"The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane\\". That's a much better book.
B004W89N72|4.0|I understand the comments from those who want a calendar that will sync with google (or something else). But for me the advantage to this app is that it *doesn't* sync with anything else. I'm a minister, using this app as a log, and keeping it local reassures me that it will be confidential.<br /><br />It works well as a log because it's tied to a calendar.  I like the fact that you can tag notes with different colors - so I can easily sort out my notes.  Only othe first  line from each note shows in the list below the calendar, but with a little planning you can use the one line to show whatever key information will work best for you.<br /><br />The notes are easily edited. The interface seems to be intuitive. So far I'm happy.  The one thing I would really like to see them change is their insistance that the tablet (on the kindle fire, at least) be in portrait mode with the power button on the bottom (where I always bump it! grrrr!)<br /><br />I do hope that if the developers *do* add in the ability to sync to google, they will make it optional.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|As most people who have read this probably have said, this is an amazing read, particularly the first book of the trilogy. I love novels with strong female protagonists, and this series has that in spades. I'm eagerly looking forward to the movie and hopes it does this series justice.
B004XVMCMQ|4.0|This movie was an unexpected delight! I had not read the book, so I had no preconceived notions, but it was a wonderful plot and well acted. I think all couples who are engaged or thinking about getting engaged should watch this movie (not necessarily together). It gives one a lot to think about prior to getting married. The lead character, Fanny Price, is a very wise young woman who sees more than many others of her age and time. What fun to find Hugh Bonneville (Sir Grantham of \\"Downton Abbey\\") buried in a supporting role in this 1999 movie. I found this film to be a combination of tragedy, romance, and comedy, particularly the latter in the way it was directed. It was time well spent!
0545265355|5.0|THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW, SO DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOKS<br /><br />Okay, so first of all, as a huge Harry Potter fan, I've been undergoing a withdrawal since the book series (and the movie series) have now ended. I love reading many different books, but I wasn't sure I would ever latch onto a new story the way I latched on to Harry Potter almost 10 years ago. Enter The Hunger Games. I actually first heard of it from Kristian Harloff of the Schmoes Know YouTube channel some months ago, and I was definitely intrigued. Of course, there's a movie coming out soon, and back when the trailers were first released, I thought it look interesting but I wasn't excited since I had no idea what it was about. I purchased this box set a few weeks ago, however, going off of the incredibly positive word-of-mouth.<br /><br />I've officially climbed onto The Hunger Games bandwagon. The first book is written in first person POV, with 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen as the main character. I will say that, as a male, I'm aware that most of the great fictional heroes are male. It's so great to see a great female hero like Katniss (along the lines of Ripley from Alien). While brave, her character is also very feminine and vulnerable, and she's just awesome! Anyway, I won't really delve too deep into the plot, but the first book, The Hunger Games, centers around this tournament in which 24 kids aged 12-18 (12 boys and 12 girls) are selected to compete in. They are put into large arenas controlled by Gamemakers, and it's basically a deathmatch. It's all a part of the Capitol (the force which runs the districts of Panem) showing the districts who's in charge. At first, I wasn't sure which of the 3 books was my favorite. Now, I'm pretty sure it's The Hunger Games, just because it takes so many unexpected twists and turns, and the reader really feels as though he/she is Katniss experiencing these games. Also, The Hunger Games is ironically the book that showcases the worst of the Capitol's power, by showing these kids killing each other.<br /><br />Now for the second book, Catching Fire. I regard this as The Empire Strikes Back of the Hunger Games Trilogy (for Star Wars fans out there). This one shows the issues that Katniss and Peeta face after the Hunger Games have ended and they have been crowned victors. The book centers around the rise of a rebellion against the Capitol, and the rising of President Snow, the ruler of the Capitol and the districts. What really sells this book is the dark, ominous, uncertain tone of it. It may reuse a few elements of the first book (for example, another Hunger Games match), but it puts a different twist on it. This book also ends on a cliffhanger MUCH like The Empire Strikes Back (I'll be shocked if Suzanne Collins isn't a Star Wars fan). This is a great book, maybe not as fresh as the first, but it's of equal quality and a great continuation.<br /><br />Now we have the final book, Mockingjay. This is definitely the one fans are most divided over. Some really like it, others were disappointed by it, and some even hate it. I'll start off by saying that Mockingjay is a full out war story, and everything in the first two books had been leading up to it. Many fans were disappointed that the Katniss-Peeta-Gale love triangle wasn't extremely romantic (though it was definitely present), and that the book seemed to end abruptly and felt incomplete. I, for one, think this book is excellent. It's not quite the read that the first two books were (though it's still captivating). While those two were dark, they still had a \\"pure candy\\" aspect to them. This one, as I said, is a full-out war story. People on both sides die, allegiances are questioned, there is anger, sadness, distrust, betrayal...everything. I was very surprised with how bold Suzanne Collins was with this book, but I was also very pleased. She doesn't sugarcoat any of it. War tears people apart, and it changes people permanently. Even if they make it through the end and rebuild their lives, they are never the same as they were before. And sure, the ending leaves some questions open, but it felt right to me. The main story, the main moral of the story was wrapped up very well. The main characters' arcs were wrapped up very well, too. It's definitely emotionally draining, but also uplifting.<br /><br />I thought the way she wrote it was fantastic. Is it my favorite of the series? I'm not sure. I would probably reread the first book before rereading this one. However, I might like this one a teensy bit more than the second, but I really can't be sure. All of the books are great for what they are.<br /><br />I'm not trying to overhype it, but this really is an epic trilogy. It has many thrills and takes many unexpected twists and turns. The first movie won't be out for another two weeks, but I could actually see the movies being even more enjoyable than the books. No disrespect to the author, of course, but the stories could benefit greatly from cinematic adaptations. Word has it that the films will take a more omniscent point of view, rather than being solely from Katniss' point of view. While seeing things from Katniss' POV works in the books, we definitely need a larger scale in the movies, so I think the atmosphere in the films could really blow people away. I especially think that Mockingjay (which I believe will be a 2-Part film) will benefit from a film adaptation, since we will probably see more of the war (and President Snow), and the ending will probably have a more definite conclusion. I think we will see some scenes from Peeta's point of view, as well. That's just my prediction anyway, and I hope I'm right.<br /><br />Again, this is a great set of books that has HUGE potential as films. Harry Potter did a great job as movies (sure, I might have some gripes here and there, but I'm just amazed that the crew stuck around to make EIGHT films, all of which are at least very good). Hunger Games needs tostick true to the books, but also bring in people who haven't read them. I LOVE the trailers we've seen so far, and I LOVE the casting (Katniss, Peeta, Effie, Snow, just about everyone), so I'm definitely looking forward to it. One things for certain, though: the world will be watching.

0439023513|5.0|I read the first two books and loved them. Looking back, I would not have anticipated the trilogy to take the direction that it did but it was a welcome finish. I think too many people expected a happy ending and that is what disappointed them but I think the ending to Mockingjay was perfect in every way. When you consider all the things that Katniss went through in the books, you can't really expect for her to be perfect and have a rainbow, unicorn happy ending. I think the ending did a good job in keeping to reality by showing that nobody ever really gets happy endings, we just make the best of what we have. All in all, I think this book was an excellent end to the trilogy and Katniss will forever be one of my favorite heroines.

B006UG90RM|4.0|A \\"Better than expected\\" effort, considering it's 2012 and Dave hasn't been around since 1984.

Also, \\"Big River\\" utilizes the old 'Running with the Devil\\" paradigm, and sets up a catchy chorus.<br /><br />The first single, \\"Tattoo\\", isn't the best song on the record, but grows on you like a weed everytime you hear it. Only thing missing......?<br /><br />.....Michael Anthony's backup vocals.<br /><br />Ed's son Wolf has stepped up his bass playing skills to a surprisingly high level.

0385343175|3.0|Although I completed the book, it was not without physically making myself.  Nothing in the book was extraordinary, nothing leaped out and grabbed my attention and made me want to finish reading it, as I was expecting.  Seems like a bunch of fluff for Danielle steel fans to get their fix, without any real substance.  I finished the book, and that's about all I can say positive on it.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is great! It provides awesome lessons for fathers and husbands on how to be a father and how to relate to family and friends. It presents realistic challenges which can be overcome when a man stands as God intended him to be. It's a movie that men, whether Christian or not, can identify with and the spiritual lessons in there are priceless. I'd advise all men and women to get a copy on dvd, it's not a movie you should watch only once! It needs to be watched over and over again!
B007BLCGNU|5.0|Clint Eastwood has again proven himself as the generations great story teller.  excellent film and excellent acting / Leonardo is amazing also.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I purchased the G930 so I could maintain the ability to talk as I moved away from my computer on occasion.  When I got the headset it worked like a dream, until a day or so later when I started to notice the right speaker going down in volume and then completely quiet, and this is with a full charge!  I'd turn it off then back on, played with the mixer settings in the Logitech Gaming Software as well as my PCs mixer, but never found a solution.  One day, as I was sorting through the plethora of other people complaining about the same problem on Logitech's forums (hey, kudos for actually having a forum on your site though) I tried plugging it in while I was using it (I had done this before, because you can still use it while it's charging) and all of a sudden my right audio was full volume.  I continue to use this fix but for the money I payed for this headset I should never have had this problem and I certainly shouldn't have to continue putting up with it.<br /><br />I own a Logitech G15 (original), G9 Mouse and G13 gaming pad.  I love them all, have had zero problems (hell, I've had my keyboard since 2006-7) but this headset is on the verge of souring Logitech products with me.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This cover is as promised in the description.  It is light weight and \\"holds\\" the Kindle snuggly.  The \\"stand\\" feature is very useful.  The elastice strap is helpful and serves as a place to clip my stylus upon when storing my Kindle Fire.
0321784421|2.0|I have so far only read the first two chapters, but already, I'm finding their writing style irritating. Pictures of hunks on the beach, got my mind wondering if they are two gays from Brighton, and I don't want that to be an issue. Concentrate on the subject matter, i.e. HTML5, not your own personalities.<br /><br />Some people think good writing style is being chatty, but good writing style is independent of that - it can be chatty or not. I found many sentences too long and difficult to parse.<br /><br />Yes, I am getting some insight into the background philosophies of HTML5 (although HTML is more and more looking like a mess), but this book reads somewhat like a Bruce and Remy personality cult. Get rid of all that, revise the overly long sentences and a book of half the size should result. Get rid of many of the adjectives and adverbs as well. Eg., \\"Let's say you run an large online newspaper and naturally wish to syndicate this story\\" can just be \\"An online newspaper may wish to syndicate this story\\", no need for chatty \\"Let's say\\", or large (in what respect, lots of pages or large readership... that's irrelevant), and get rid of naturally. Around 50% of the sentences in the book are like this. Get rid of the \\"lively\\" writing to make the writing more lively!<br /><br />Then use better examples, rather than those about \\"Bruce Lawson being the World's sexiest man\\". This is just unprofessional nonsense. Professional writing does not have to be cold, but the opposite extreme is far worse.<br /><br />The other thing that is really annoying is that this book is now in 2nd edition in early 2012. I got the first edition around Nov 2011 and it was fairly newly published then. So that is annoying to think that the first edition was obviously rushed out to make money with material that must have been in the pipeline. I was going to hold off on this review until I had read more, but this second edition grab for more money has made me review early.
B0067QPVJ6|3.0|Another movie that really disappointed me, after seeing all the previews you would think the movie would be great, this movie was a big disaster to me was not good at all.Will really think more about buying some of the movies. They all flops.

1439116881|4.0|Excellent book.  As I began reading the book, I thought, OMG she is so dead on. My mother has Alzheimer's, so I could really relate.<br />The only part I had trouble with was when Alice gave her reading. It seemed to be a bit unrealistic.  Good for the the family, though, and giving the reader additional information about the disease.  Perhaps that can really happen, it hasn't with my mother, who currently doesn't know who I am, and certainly can't read a script, but then, she wasn't a college professor.  So a little puzzling to me.<br />Also, I'm curious to know what her original ending was.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading The Hunger Games I was excited to read Catching Fire and was very disappointed until I got two/thirds of the way through it.  Mockingjay on the other hand was a much better book, but still not quite what The Hunger Games was.  I highly recommend reading all three.  I felt like the author did a good job of bringing the saga to a conclusion.

B005HS00NW|5.0|This is the best CD to come out in the last 30 years. No Hype, i'm serious.<br /><br />I'm a 46-yr-old music lover who has been seriously listening to & collecting music since the day my mom bought me a 45rpm of Barry Manilow's \\"Mandy\\" for my 10th birthday in 1975. Since then, I have maintained an avid, eclectic mix of everything from Abba to New Order to ZZTop. My favorite genres are probably 70s rock and 80s New Wave.<br /><br />I have tried and tried to come up with some other release I could compare to \\"Hurry Up We're Dreaming,\\" and the only thing I can come up with that comes close in terms of sheer volume of great music is Pink Floy'd \\"The Wall.\\" Probably not the best comparison, but there is a little bit of Roger Waters in Anthony Gonzalez.<br /><br />There's a lot of good music out there if you wade through the majority of dreck. I had previously heard and really liked \\"We Own the Sky,\\" but nothing M83 had done before could have prepared my for this CD. Gonzalez simply blew me away with this release.<br /><br />Regardless of genre, if you like music PERIOD, buy this CD NOW!
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|I have long held the view that Stephen King is not only a first-rate novelist, but also an important one - someone whose books will be read long after most others of his day have been forgotten. What marks him out as such a gifted writer for me, are two things: his wonderful imagination; and his ability to captivate a reader with his ideas. It is no surprise that he would be attracted to the concept of time-travel, or to the ongoing theories surrounding the murder of JFK. His afterword, by the way, makes clear all of his views on the latter. This novel is fast-paced, never less than convincing (no small feat, when you think about it), sad, funny and always suspenseful. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a King novel will definitely like this.<br /><br />My only slight quibble was the section when Jake Epping, the main character, falls in love. There are a few moments here that are less than gripping, even a little twee. However this in no way spoiled my overall enjoyment of, what is, quite some achievement. Would I read it again, as I have most other Stephen King novels? Absolutely. No fan of this great author's work should miss this book.
1250006341|5.0|I am astounded by the beautiful photography in this book!  The articles are informative about the times, places, etc.  The explanations of the duties of the servants are very educational.  There is even a section of the book devoted to the beautiful Edwardian clothing and how those gorgeous dinner dresses are made for the cast members.<br />I thought I would save this book to read this summer to get my Downton fix before the new seasons starts but I have already devoured half the book just days after receiving it.  DEFINITELY worth the money!

1400069289|5.0|This is a wonderful, highly readable book that examines how and why individuals as well as organizations form habits as well as exploring what might be done to change those that are unproductive or even dangerous.  Like Malcolm Gladwell, Charles Duhigg uses specific anecdotes to illustrate his main ideas, which make for engaging reading.  Learning how Paul O'Neill turned around Alcoa, how Rosa Parks' act sparked a civil rights movement in Montgomery, and how crises within the Rhode Island Hospital as well as the London Underground all illuminate the significance of understanding behavior that obstructs or prevents positive action.<br /><br />I loved Duhigg's personal example of eating a cookie mid-afternoon when he was bored and how he ultimately transformed that habit.  In doing so, he shows us how to identify the steps that shape our habits in order to change, should we consciously choose to.

This shows Ray's ability to adapt to different styles of songs that I don't think very many musicians of today have the \\"Genius\\" to duplicate.<br /><br />Couldn't believe the value vs. price paid at Amazon.com for this CD.
B0058YPG1G|1.0|The only reason I watch TV nowadays is for Jersey Shore and MTV in general. Wanting to expand my tastes, I heard about this show which was apparently one of the greatest shows on TV. After watching a few episodes, I was too disgusted to even go any further. The horrible acting was bad enough, but its message made me throw up. This show condones smoking meth, which is the worst drug in the world. How could the great FCC allow this garbage? This filth needs to be cancelled, and Bryan Crapson should be arrested for association. This show is the reason why our country is in decline.

B006YXTRHY|4.0|I have to admit, I read the first three Twilight books in about a week. And then I read it again a few times before Breaking Dawn was finally released in summer 2008. The movies, however, have almost completely fallen flat in my opinion, none of them really measured up to their literary counterparts until Eclipse which was good but still a bit silly. THIS movie, however, might exceed my expectations.<br />This is a much better movie adaptation of the original books; the acting is better, the writing and directing are better, and the special effects are way way better. FINALLY a movie as exciting as the book version, if not better. I will definitely be picking this one up on DVD, once the price comes down. For now, digital rental will hold me over.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of the series.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|At $3 this is worth picking up. Mark Cuban's eBook \\"How to Win at the Sport of Business\\" is really just a compilation of his free blog posts.

You do get more out of it then you would from his normal posts; the old posts have been updated with more details and some commentary that gives you a little more insight into Cuban. There is a lot of great advice and a handful of wonderful quotes in here but don't think you're going to finish this ebook and win just like Mark Cuban. Cuban's a smart guy who stays ahead of the competition. The best advice you'll get from this ebook is to make sure to stay ahead of the other guys in your field.

B007H51DQG|5.0|So far I've found the second season to be slow, but NOT uninteresting. (So they did a few things wrong, so what?)  This isn't a bad show; it isn't even a good show. IT IS A GREAT SHOW!

No one is forcing you to watch this, so PLEASE stop your petty moaning. (Ha Ha!)

B004GIPCU0|5.0|Awesome product. I am getting much lower temps on my top gpu. The purpose of using this was to cool it better because its sandwiched on top another gpu on a 990fxe biostar board. Idle temps 40c where the stock cooler was getting me a warm 51c. Load temps hover around 60c in heavy gaming after 15 minutes. Good buy. If you are in Japan dont order this go out and buy it at a pc shop. They are only 2000 yen which translates into about $23. Great product even for this amazon price.

159514188X|5.0|Jay Asher sweeps nothing under the rug - my hats off to him for that. We know that people can be cruel. What we don't think about is what we do unintentionally. The choices we make that we don't think are going to affect anyone but us. You don't know how many times I've seen somebody try to excuse disgusting behavior under the umbrella of 'it was just a joke, lighten up!' I think everyone of junior high to high school age should have to read this book in school. Hell, I think adults need this book too!<br /><br />This was one of the hardest things I ever had to read. Yet,I couldn't put it away for more than ten minutes. I finished it the day I was loaned it by my cousin. The whole time I was reading Hannah's story I felt like I was watching someone that I knew and wanted to help but couldn't save. It made me very sad.<br /><br />I promise you, you read this book and you will want to try to be a better person. Thanks, big thanks to the author. We all need to be reminded sometimes that what we do and we say always has consequences.

0143120530|4.0|The book offers a great insight into the history of the art of memory, as well as the process of how Joshua went on to become a U.S. memory champion after just a year of training. Everyday I'm more convinced that we all have remarkable capacities that are waiting to be exploited. Since some of the characters in this book may be portrayed as \\"geniuses\\", I'm somehow reminded of what Paul Graham said in one of his essays, that whenever we call someone a genius, it gives us an excuse to be lazy and not put on the hard work required to succeed.    I like that towards the end of the book the author points out the importance of cultivating our ability to remember since our memories make us who we are. It's also interesting the way in which the characters in the book approach the process of memorizing stuff, because they try to make it fun, which means we could be enriching our learning experiences by applying the same methods this guys use.    I strongly suggest the following talks so you can get better acquainted with some of the funny, interesting and peculiar characters mentioned in the book:    Ed Cooke on TEDx : [...]    Joshua Foer - Step Outside Your Comfort Zone and Study Yourself Failing : [...]    Documentary on Daniel Tammet : [...]
1400156343|5.0|Simon Vance has mastered the voice of Frankenstein and his hated creation: \\"the fiend.\\" Simon Vance should get an award for his masterful narration of this unabridged reading of Frankenstein. Each character gets a unique voice, and each voice seems so right, so perfect, so able to extract every last dramatic energy and subtle nuance Mary Shelley gave to her literary creations. This audio version is a must have! I rank it right up there with Jim Dale's rendition of Barrie's Peter Pan.<br /><br />The story is the foundation which Vance's magic builds on. So, to be sure, not only is the excellent narration a huge reason for buying this particular audio version of Frankenstein, the deep and moving tale of the \\"Demon\\" and his heartless creator is the prime mover for owning this classic gothic tale so one can enjoy repeated listenings and ever higher climbs to deep meaning and literary revelation. Michael Naulander wrote an excellent mini essay expositing a nice framework by which to appreciate this text; therefore, my review is less abstract and more in praise of this particular version of Frankenstein, due to Vance's oh so pleasent voice and wonderful characterizations. Any one at any age will simply love this tale, the young for the plot and uplifting and complex diction, the not so young for the philosophical and emotional depths, as well as the uplifting and luscious diction. Every word is chosen carefully and perfectly.<br /><br />Best,<br />MLC
B0061QD7YS|5.0|lady and the tramp, In this time the renovation or restoration of the film itself is excelent. The bright colors and great original English soundtrack makes this film a great classic. However, the Spanish dubbing is a little bit disapointing; the main reason is because the grace is missing and the voices do not match correctly. It is hard and complicated to compare the original Spanish dubbing with the 1997 dubbing. Once again, the cats are not singing with feeling and the little chihuahua doesn´t talk with a funy voice like used to have it. I understand that Disney has to work with a re-make voice becase of the legal problems. But, just imagine, how magnificent could be if we have these films (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and Lady and the tramp) with theirs original Spanish dubbing and perhaps those who have legal concerns with the companay fix their differences and make a good deal in order to allow us to hear the wonderful voices that they placed on those films. I have not problems to listen the film in English or Spanish, but I expect a high quality product. If Disney was alive, he would request a better quality in the work of dubbing although he had to do it ten times or more.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|The somewhat mixed reviews caused me to hesitate before diving in the Nightwish's Imaginaerum. Glad I overcame my reservations, for Imaginaerum really is a class act from a classy band. The tempo is very varied, and Annete has really become one with the band, no more newbie status. She sounds bold and dangerous and wickedly seducting. The songs themselves are all fantastic. Many other reviews listed each track and rated each one. With their harsh judgment ringing in my ears, I was expecting the worse when I first began listing to Imaginaerum. How so utterly misleading I now protest.<br /><br />Imaginaerum is lovable from the first listen. While, yes, I do have all of Nightwish's albums, I, luckily, don't look to the past with any weepy nostalgia. Taking this album head on as a set list of songs that exists now and for it's own sake, as opposed to analyzing every nuance from \\"then\\" to \\"now,\\" this album stands on it's own very well. It has that creepy carnival theme without getting too stuck in it that the theme overwhelms the music. This album in some ways reminds me of a mini metal verson of the Wall by Floyd. It's definatly darker than the last album with Annette and doesn't have as celtic a sound nor as eclectic, but this new album was not meant to be, and for the purpose it was created, it sounds great.<br /><br />Lesson learned, take each reviewer with a grain of salt as we are all different; therefore, don't take my word for the fact that this album is every bit as good as anything done in the past, take it for a test drive yourself. Hell, I personally loved the spoken language segment on Song of Myself, but I am an English major, and I love poetry and even the reference to Walt Whitman's great poem, Song of Mysef. I don't know that poem by heart, it's very long, and I haven't managed to see if the poem and the song jive in any meaningful way, yet; regardless, it's very perfect in its own right.<br /><br />Great job Nightwish!<br /><br />Michael
B001MEJY8W|4.0|First off, if you are planning to watch this film, I recommend that you do not read any reviews as it might give away the story. Also, it might change your expectations of the film and you don't need to go into it thinking of it a certain way. And finally, this review does not contain any plot spoilers.<br /><br />Yes, I would consider this a horror film, but not in the traditional sense. There is bloodshed, killing, and lots of brutality, but honestly, nothing that I would consider too difficult to watch if you are a seasoned horror movie fan. If you have maybe heard about \\"the ending\\" of this movie and you are worried you won't be able to watch it, let me just say that it isn't as bad or sick as you think.<br /><br />I came across the title of this movie while looking up \\"top horror movies\\" lists and this one caught my eye. Based off the reviews I read (which I regret doing), I thought this film was going to be something completely different. \\"Bloody, disgusting, hard to watch, heart breaking, sick, most disturbing movie ever\\" as people like to describe it. At first, I thought this was going to be a torture porn film, but I did read that there were some philosophical and spiritual ideas in there, which intrigued me. I'll admit I am fascinated by torture in the philosophical sense, that some people are completely void of empathy and do some very depraved things to others. It excites me and terrifies me, knowing that people out there are suffering greatly everyday and the fate of humanity in this cruel world.<br /><br />Moving on... admittedly, I did have very high expectations going into this film. After I was done watching it, I realized it wasn't at all what I expected and I actually felt a little disappointed. I decided I was going to be one of those people who thought the movie was overrated and over-hyped, etc. It had some scary scenes and there was a lot of hopelessness, but nothing that exceptionally moved me. But then for the rest of the day, I just couldn't stop thinking about the ending of the movie. I was annoyed with it. I wanted to make sense of the ending and I wanted to understand why some people thought it was so brilliant. I kept thinking about it and eventually decided to watch it again.<br /><br />This time around, I didn't feel more or less scared but I felt something different from it. I'm not quite sure how to describe it. I feel like I 'get' the meaning this movie was trying to convey, despite the vague ending. And when you do, you will realize it too. You might feel horrified or you might just feel hopeless. Yet, is there a point to it all anyhow?<br /><br />Horror fans who are expecting something like Saw or Hostel... it's NOTHING like it. Watch it anyways. It really is kind of poetic although it may not be apparent at first. As far as the violence level in it... if you can watch Saw/Hostel, you should have no problem seeing this. The people who think this is super disturbing and sick... I don't think of this movie that way at all. Yes, it is disturbing and sick but it is not the feeling I got in the end. I just feel sad. You might feel differently. I guess it depends on how you look at the ending. And for people who are not into horror... I think this might be too much for you. I wouldn't recommend this for 'fun Friday night horror with the family'.

B004HS1L9U|1.0|This book is not what its author claims it is. It is not the true story of a trek to freedom. It makes me angry to know that Slavomir Rawicz would live his life claiming to have done something that he didn't do, making himself a hero, and then making money off of it! I was about one third of the way through the book when it became evident that it was a hoax to me. That is when I began researching it. Look into it yourself. 13 days walking all day long through the Gobi desert without water or food, finding water, and then going ten more days without??? Crossing the Himalayas with nothing to carry water in, a meager amount of food they just happened to get before they started. How did they melt snow? No container of any sort, no firewood of any sort? The two wild Yetis were what really threw me for a loop...............Don't waste your time!

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'd seen some tweets concerning The Forever Girl by Rebecca Hamilton, but hadn't fully sought it out.  The cover was pretty, and the author's tweets were fun.  Finally, last week, after stumbling across the book for the millionth time, I took it as a sign.  This book was intended for me.<br /><br />I can say now, my only regret is that I didn't buy it sooner!<br /><br />I won't give you too much back story.  Partially because you can read the synopsis above, but mostly I don't trust myself with spoilers.<br /><br />The bones of the tale are this:  Sophia is an average girl, living in a painfully small town.  She is very much the `Boo Radley' of the neighborhood due to her Wiccan religion, and a very overzealous Christian woman who hopes to rid the town of her evil.  As if being stalked by a crazy lady wasn't enough, Sophia must deal with a constant hissing, a buzz that rattles around in her brain 24/7.  She managed to go to college, and now hold a job, but the constant noise never leaves her mind.  Curing her curse is her number one priority.  That is until she meets a whole host of supernatural beings, some dangerous, some carrying very human burdens, and one downright sexy.  She finds herself embroiled in a centuries old battle, first to find out about her own ancestry, then to save those she loves.<br /><br />I loved this book, and I'll give you just a few reasons why although I could probably come up with dozens.<br /><br />I was a Wiccan for fifteen years.  Rebecca Hamilton has been the ONLY fiction author I have ever read who described ritual, as well as Wiccan beliefs accurately and completely.  For her insight and research, I applaud and respect her.<br /><br />The main character Sophia drew me in from the beginning of the book.  She has a crazy mother (who can't relate to that) and is trying very hard to live her life, despite her hardships financially as well as medically (the constant noise in her head)  As the book evolved my only complaint was Sophia's fear of her own power and her raging self doubt.  More than once, I wanted to hop into the story, shake her like a ragdoll and tell her she was strong enough to do anything!  (There is also a sex scene I wouldn't have minded hopping into as well.  I'm telling ya, buy the book!)<br /><br />Keeping the storyline moving was the lovable Charles.  He is a member of the supernatural realm, and I don't want to say too much on that, but he oozes sex appeal.  He added some much needed humor to the extremely serious Sophia, and helped to keep the story moving at a good pace.  Not to mention he sounds drop dead gorgeous, and there are a few scenes not intended for children in the book.<br /><br />I have to tip my hat to Hamilton for my favorite line in the book.  I don't know if it was an intended knock on the ever popular yet poorly written Twilight series or not but as Charles pops up at Sophia's window one night, she crossly asks him if he's spying on her.<br /><br />His response?  \\"You're not so interesting that I came to watch you sleep, darlin'.\\"<br /><br />Rarely does a line literally make me laugh out loud as that one did.<br /><br />Hamilton also manages to put together an excellent \\"supporting cast\\" of characters, including Sophia's best friend Ivory, and Charles's best friend Adrian.  The characters are not only rich and welcoming additions, but they end up having very deep and meaningful backgrounds that assist in tying the entire story into a neat little bow.  Personally, I love neat little bows, and so I was in reader heaven.<br />All in all the book was great.  It wrapped up nicely while still leaving a few questions unanswered for the next books in the series.  Those books I will not hesitate to buy.fear of her own power and her raging self doubt.

0800141660|4.0|Along with the famous Andrew Davies BBC/A&E miniseries of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was the first of the famous series of adaptations in the mid 90s that sparked a kind of cultural Jane Austen boom. It was also considered at the time one of the best, although its pretty-pretty costumes, sets and cinematography were soon supplemented in the imagination(almost blessedly) by the terrifically gritty and muddy BBC version of PERSUASION helmed by Roger Mitchell. Even so, the exquisite prettiness of this Ang Lee-directed version presents one vision of Jane Austen very dear to many readers' hearts, and the deservedly Oscar-winning screenplay by Emma Thompson brings out much of the novel's great humor as well as its poignancy, and makes the plot's many twists and turns compelling.<br /><br />Many Austen scholars at the time noted that Thompson (then thirty-six) was too old to be quite believable at the elder and more stoic of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor; but the difference in marriageability ages in the late 20th century seems to account better now for the disparity in Thompson's age and that of her heroine. Similarly, though Hugh Grant was faulted in 1995 for pulling a more pronounced version of his usual adorably bashful stammering shtick as Elinor's admirer, Edward Ferrars, in retrospect it seems quite approrpiate to the character (and helps explain why he has such difficulty making his love for Elinor known in his earlier scenes). What has not improved over time is the odd casting of Alan Rickman as the more faithful of Marianne's beaux, Colonel Brandon: his sinister and slow delivery (used to such beautiful effect in other films) seems oddly out of whack, such that by the end it seems almost as if the Dashwoods are marrying poor Marianne off to a second Bluebeard. Much more successful are the impossibly dashing Greg Wise (Thompson's romantic partner after this film) as Willoughby, the estimable Harriet Walter as Mrs. John Dashwood, Hugh Laurie as an amusingly sour Mr. Palmer, and Elizabeth Spriggs as the impossibly vivacious Mrs. Jennings. The highest performing honors belong to Emma Thompson, ideally cast as the patient Elinor, and Kate Winslet as her emotional sister Marianne: it is a testament to both women's skills that, though they had played very similar roles recently before this film that had made enormous impacts (Thompson as the sisterly and wise Margaret Schlegel in HOWARDS END, and Winslet as the overwrought teenager Juliet Hulme in HEAVENLY CREATURES), their performances in this film are quite distinct from those earlier successes.
0375869026|5.0|I'm so glad I was able to read some reviews of this book to know I would want to read it. It turned out to be all the reviews indicated, and is a truly great book.<br /><br />For those who have disabilities of any kind, life can be complicated. For children there are many obstacles, and also for their parents, friends, teachers, classmates. And yet, if everyone will be kinder than necessary, those obstacles can be dealt with.<br /><br />This book has a happy ending. I always love that--I look for books that have that, and avoid books that don't. I'm careful about selecting \\"literature\\" to read, or \\"thrillers.\\" Although I do like cozy mysteries!<br /><br />One thing I wondered about in this book that turned out great was the author writing from one point of view for a several chapters, then changing to another character and then to another. It turned out to be a great way to tell us how people were perceiving things and changing in their experiences, beliefs, and emotions.<br /><br />If you have any dealings with people with disabilities, including children, this is a very good book for you to read. One thing it will show you is that each person is an individual. No two people are alike. And there are lots of good people in the world. Thank God.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is better than nothing if you have the kind of stroller where the handlebars are very upright.  The inner walls of the drink parts stretch so it will hold a variety of beverage containers.  It has a small zippered part inside the big part to hold...  I'm not sure what.  Something small.  Overall I don't think it's great because it's very swingy, being attached at only two points, and I don't like how the main compartment is so open.  I have things that \\"live\\" in my strollers - our zoo keys, the leash to my BOB, things like that.  I don't like to have to empty the stroller caddy of these things when I put the stroller in the car.  If your stroller handle bar has any sort of flatness to it, I'd suggest the Jolly Jumper stroller caddy instead - it is like the Bob but cheaper.  It attaches in 4 places and just feels more stable and structured, and the inner part zips closed.  If your stroller is very upright, though, this works fairly well.  In its favor, the main compartment is somewhat larger, and the drink parts will hold slightly bigger drinks.  I feel like maybe there should be another set of straps at the bottom, to add stability, as well as a cover for the center compartment - although this might take away from the stretchy sides of the drink holders.

0440243688|5.0|I've read most of the Jack Reacher novels, and while sometimes I wish he would just settle down and get a job, another part of me enjoys the thrill of his next adventure, because you never really know what it will be. It's not formulaic like some other mystery writers, same plot, different characters, etc., etc. Admittedly, I do have to shrug off the fact that Reacher manages to find trouble in practically every hamlet of America, but this one had a twist--a suicide bomber on a train?  Jack steps in and gets involved in a deceptive plot that starts in Manhattan, but involves sinister characters in Washington, California, Afghanistan. Enjoy the ride.

B0074QGGK6|5.0|Just as he does with his poetry, Austin Kleon has cut out all the words that are of no use. There is no fluff, no pretense, no crap, just concise practical and motivational advice. I flew through this book and will read it again and again I am sure. I especially like the part on productive procrastination and that is what I am practicing right now as I should be working on my own poetry but instead am leaving a book review ....great great read , something for everyone .
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book is amazing! Not only is it sinfully hot, it is also very well written. It is a real page-turner that just cannot be put down.
1451648537|3.0|The end of the book contains a couple pages which the author debates not including, where in his own words Jobs says a bit about how he saw himself. Ironically i found these pages to be closer to the objective and rational treatment i had been disappointed to not find in the rest of the book.... unfortunately they are short.<br /><br />There is information and facts and tidbits that are interesting but since the book settles on rather flip, rollingstone magazine conclusions , by and large i left with the same questions i came in with.<br /><br />for example:<br />-why was he so dedicated to the integrated closed system? The answer presented is basically : because the alternative is just crap...the author wants to display Jobs's very extreme personality like a rock star or something...ok the guy was intense but these issues he was dealing with are interesting enough to deserve more of the focus and I longed for a more coherent explanation, which throughout the book i gathered was just not possible to obtain. Until i read those last pages included by Jobs himself, from which i conclude that Jobs was actually probably providing this type information but ....it just was not as exciting as focusing on his eccentricities.
B006GH6IS4|5.0|Fans of Queen will not be disappointed one bit by \\"Queen: Days Of Our Lives.\\" (Q:DOOL) Frankly, fans of music in general will not be disappointed either!<br /><br />Starting at the very beginning of Queen (Smile, Ibex, Sour Milk Sea, etc.) \\"Q:DOOL\\" takes viewers on the inside track to the band, from friendships and relationships, to rows and egos, to making some of the finest music ever recorded. With new interviews and insight from Brian May and Roger Taylor, this documentary is every fan's dream. You'll hear stories from the early days, their days of rising success, the days of being on top of the world, life on the road and in the studio, as well as the struggles that came part and parcel with all of that. You'll also see newly discovered, rare performance and interview footage from all four members of the band. It should be noted that John Deacon does not appear in new interview footage and, in fact, neither does Freddie Mercury since he (in a nod to Monty Python) insists on remaining dead.<br /><br />This is not a Freddie Mercury documentary. (If that's what you're looking for try \\"Freddie Mercury: Lover of Life, Singer of Songs.\\") This documentary provides some of his backstory but for the most part ties it into the band and his life with respect to the band. Another nice thing is that they don't dwell on his sexuality the whole time. Too often that becomes the focus of Queen docs and they made certain to acknowledge it but not beat the dead horse about it. You'll hear the personal stories of Brian and Roger coping with the news of Freddie's health, his decline and non-stop professionalism, and the ultimate loss of their friend, family member, and working partner.<br /><br />If you love music and you love Queen, you will love this. The Blu-ray edition does come with added extras such as music videos and extended interviews but even the standard DVD is well worth your attention.
B004I744AS|1.0|literally it is possible the worst app ever a  dictionary from the 1800s would work better than this stupid app
1594744769|5.0|This book is very good! I thought it was a bit weird at first but it truly is genius! I would absolutely recommend this book for all ages!
0525478817|5.0|It took 20 minutes from the moment I closed this book to the moment that my throat decided to re-opened and the valves that control the pipes to my eyes finally shut.<br /><br />This book is not perfect. I found the beginning a bit choppy and the dialogue unrealistic in the first few scenes. But wow, this book is good. The 20 minutes I spent crying after I finished this book were not self-indulgent moments, they were legit, gdamn, stop sobbing it's 3 in the morning and I have to wake up early inconvenient but appreciated emotions.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Really nice app for weather and allows you to easily add site while traveling and not have to mess with your home settings.  Also found that support for locations is better than others i have used.  One problem is that when installed the first time it kept crashing until i removed and reinstalled ... hope we are good to go now
0439023483|5.0|I purchased this book by the recommendation of several friends and I have to say that it is an awesome read, so much so that I ordered the second book upon finishing this one! I couldn't wait to turn the page. In fact, it only took me 1 day to read it because I was so consumed! It's full of action, love, friendship, and gives the importance of family and home. A little bit for everybody. I would recommend this book over and over again!
B001TN1EBG|3.0|a few good songs but not as good as i expected the entire album to be. i listen to it alot and skip alot of the songs.
B00018TI5E|5.0|WARNING:LISTENING TO THIS RECORD COULD RESULT IN ECTOPLASM VAPORIZATION AND ULTIMATELY TRANSCENDENCE: I would compare the quality of this record to that of \\"Hermit of Mink Hollow\\" by Todd Rundgren. Some people sit around wasting tape but not John, He's making all of the the right noises here, sculpting this sound wave the way Michael Angelo would a block of stone. The songs are beautiful, the musicianship is awesome, the mix is perfect, This man is creative beyond his own limits and this album will stand the test of the time. IF YOU CLAIM TO HAVE GOOD TASTE ? YOU SURE AS HELL NEED ONE OF THESE...IT IS AN ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE! (went way out on a limb with OLGA for you on this one I hope you appreciate it)

B000F2C87Q|5.0|If anyone is a true die hard fan for these guys and the blues this album should not be missed, this is modern blues/rock in the purist form. In my opinion their best album as well, the new ones, Brothers and El Camino, are kinda toned down, and the bassist and keyboardist are featured in the songs too much. This album has no accompaniment just raw guitar and drums as it should be. Its worth more than it is right now.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|It is a great movie. The kind you can watch over and over again. I've always enjoyed Clint Eastwoods movies, especially his westerns.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This a great for people on the go. Bible on ur phone tablet, anything u always have Gods word right at ur finger tips.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is awesome. I love the fact that I can advance fairly easy and that I don't need to pull out my credit card to progress in the game. this game is a keeper
1419701533|5.0|My son purchased these, and we love reading them to one another.  Very pleased.  The box set is a great deal.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is super addictive and has plenty of challenges. Ive had it for 2 weeks or so and I only have on challenge left &gt;:D<br />looooove this game :)
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This free game is lots of fun, but very addictive!  So far have not spent any actual money, but have been very tempted.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The need to have credits to build is a little extreme. These are available for purchase, but I'd rather spend my non-virtual money on non-virtual things. You can not move a building once it is placed, making any kind of &quot;after thought&quot; organization impossible. I also dislike the constant request on posting on Facebook. Asking once is enough and most people don't like announcing how they waste their time on mindless time wasting games. It's more of a private fun. The good things are, once you do get a feel for the game and pre-determine how you want to set up your city, it can be fun and inventive. The growing of virtual funds is easy and upgrading a breeze. Keeping ppl happy is a bit tricky, but doable and the fact that you can collect one credit a day by simply checking on your progress once a day is nice. Also, the game continuing to generate your income when the game is minimized is nice. To earn the final star for this review, make the credits for building more accessible. As far as free games go, definitely one of the best.
044024238X|1.0|POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT - marked section<br />This a very light book, slightly entertaining in the first couple of chapters when it starts to describe the main characters (even if it stays very much on the surface with the basic attributes: the cute guy, the mean boss, the friendly boss, and one crazy friend) and their environment. As long as the book stays in the real world, it is pleasant to read. But when the twist happens, everything becomes so unrealistic as well as highly predictable once it is understood that the author mimics the clueless antics of the protagonist of the Bridget Jones' Diary.<br /><br />SPOILER HERE<br />A top layer from the City not realizing she's interviewing for a housekeeping job? (and not understanding the legal consequences on leading the employers on?<br />A supposedly brilliant woman with a IQ of 158 living on her own does not ANYTHING about cooking, cleaning, ironing?<br />The outlandish cover-up strategies go unnoticed?(catering sandwiches with a tag naming the type of sandwich, replacing the employers' clothes through a personal shopper from Harrods, learning to cook in one week-end from the gardener's mother who can read/understand/make a Maxim's menu????)<br />Come on.<br />And then, of course, there is only one other employee on the property - the gardener - and of course he's muscular, intelligent, and available...<br />And of course, he offers the perfect solution: his mother will teach her everything<br />And of course, they fall for each other in one week...<br />And of course, she can read a very little clause (oh so dangerous for her employer) at the bottom of the contract while serving coffee...<br />And of course, her employer is lending her emeralds to go one a date with their gardener...<br />And of course, it turns out that she was wronged by - guess who?...<br />SPOILER END<br /><br />So I am sorry to say that after a while I could not stand wasting my time reading what was becoming painfully slow on a very predictable path and I had to skim through the paragraphs just to get confirmation at every turn of the page that I had corrrectly guessed the next step.
B0071MV540|4.0|My teenage son and I watched this after he begged me to rent it.  When the price dropped to 1.99 for the weekend  I figured why not.  We really enjoyed it!  Contrary to the advertisements for the movie, Eddie Murphy was okay and had his moments, but the real stars were Stiller, Broderick and Sidibe.  Sidibe needs to work on that accent but some of her lines when combined with her delivery and attitude were hilarious! If you were hoping this would be a comeback movie for Murphy, keep hoping.  It was an improvement over a lot of his more recent stuff, but not that much of an improvement.  He's a little old to play the \\"Friday: con artist, thief guy\\" type of character.  If his agent is watching, please start recommending roles that are more suitable for his age and recapture his raw humor because this watered down, playing characters way too young for him thing is a bit depressing.  All in all, it was a fun movie and we had several laugh out loud moments so I would recommend it for a brief escape from reality and a few good laughs.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|A fun, retro style game with the same feel as Galaga from the 80s.  Good music and graphics.  The story is cheesy but adds a lot to the game... much better than just a plotless shoot-em-up.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Riveting, definitely an awesome continuation to the saga. Wishing for the next installment, but now pretty sure there will be more than one more in the story arc.The detail is incredible. Mr. Martin knows how to transport the reader into another world, one I find myself reluctant to leave.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is so much fun, Angry Birds (seasons) is fun when you try to get the pigs with the birds.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I really like these headphones! I bought these mainly for running and vigorous exercise. I have other ear-buds, but those constantly fall out of my ears. I guess my ears are too small or something. With these I can run without worrying about them falling out. And to top that, they are also very discreet. You can't really tell I'm wearing headphones or at least you won't realize it at first glance. Also these headphones don't cancel sound out which is perfect. I need to hear my surroundings (I don't want to get run over or something).
0142419400|5.0|This was such an adorable book and I really wish that I could just curl up inside of it and live inside of Anna's and Etienne's world. I started it with the intention of liking the book by the end but not loving it, and I think I fell in love by the end of it all. Living in Paris and experiencing an entirely new world with a group of friends that are absolutely wonderful in their own quirky ways is something that I really wish I could do, and I was glad that I got the chance to experience it through Anna's eyes.<br /><br />Moving to a new place is always a hard thing, and I can't even imagine having to move to an entire new country for my last year of high school, like Anna did, but at the same time it'd be an amazing experience to move to Paris for your senior year. I could relate to Anna the entire book, even though I've never been in her exact position. Her friends were all wonderful, and each one had their own positives and negatives. I really liked the fact that they just swooped in and took care of Anna, letting her into their group so easily.<br /><br />But I loved Etienne. Dear god, Etienne St. Clair. I wanted him so very badly, and not even as a relationship. I just wanted to be his friend because he really was just a magical person. I loved his personality and I just wanted to ruin his relationship with his girlfriend the entire time because I hated her and I didn't even know much about her except that she abandoned her friends when she graduated.<br /><br />Out of all of the characters, Josh was my favourite. I just loved him and wanted to be his best friend, because he just seemed like such a cool guy. I did despise Toph though, and Anna's best friend from home. It didn't matter that I understood the reasons behind what they'd done and that I shouldn't hate them as much as I did. I still hate them, but kudos to Stephanie Perkins for at least giving me reasons why I shouldn't.<br /><br />All in all, I really loved this novel and I loved the ending. Just the mere fact that Anna and Etienne managed to figure out a way to foil Etienne's father's plans was just wonderful. I very much enjoyed the fact that Etienne and Anna ended up going to schools where they could be together in college and maybe for the rest of their lives...that was wonderful too.<br /><br />I adored this book and I adored that this was initially written as a NaNo novel, because that just proves that NaNo, while being the most ridiculous time of the year, is also a time where magic comes alive through writing and creatively breaking brains. This is definitely a book that I will read again, and I can't wait until I do.
B005UT29Z0|4.0|I have no idea why this movie failed to have much buzz because it was extremely good!  The cast was great, the subject matter engaging and the presentation very honest.  I think the average person can watch this movie and have a better understanding of big business and the stock market.  Face it, even if you just pay your money into a 401 K and for some unexplainable reason simply trust the people you're handing your money to, you should take time to watch this film.  If this easy to follow movie can't give you an idea of why your trust and lack of follow up is misplaced, nothing will.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Daniel Kahneman has written a very detailed and interesting book about the way we think and respond to impulses from outside. Even though it is complicated issue it is very easy read.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I heard of this series thru Todays show and how the women loved it !!! I had to read it and to my amazement I loved it.. i cant put it down .. its not trashy its very erotic loved it
B004W89N72|3.0|Not a bad Calendar/ Notepad combo, but considering all the required permissions I can only hope that the abilities this App has will be improved with the ability to sync with other devices such as my comp, and directions on how to actually use this app are a must!  Most apps like this are very intuitive, this one falls short, way short of being intuitive.  Simple, easy use is a must for any app, especially this type.  Frustrating your customers is a bad idea.  This was good as a FAotD but not worth $1.50 as it stands right now.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I have been waiting anxiously for this movie to come out! I saw it in theaters with my 3 sons and we had a great time. With Easter coming up I can't wait to see it again and was even looking online to try to find it. I thought E.B. was a great character and the plot was cute for kids but still fun for me. I am not sure my husband will want to watch this movie more than once, but the other 4 of us will watch it again and again!
0525478817|5.0|My first John Green novel and I LOVED it!  Much laughter and a fair share of tears; when a book, especially a fictional book, can evoke feelings this strong, it is worthy of the highest rating, which is why I gave it all five stars.  I can't say enough about this story except do yourself a favor and read it.
B004W89N72|3.0|For a generic calendar, it's very good! Although not being able to sync with calendar apps or task managing apps like astrid really is this app's downfall
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The first Downton Abbey was quite a surprise.  I noticed it one night<br />on my instant play through netflix.  I couldn't stop watching it!  So<br />when the 2nd Downton Abbey came out, I couldn't wait to buy it.  I was<br />a little weary of it not being that good compared to the first one.<br />...I definitely was not disappointed!  It was wonderful!  The story<br />kept moving along a kept you glued to the TV.  Alot of the stories that<br />had loose ends in the first one were summed up in the second.<br />...The best part is they are filming Downton Abbey 3 right now!!  To be<br />released later this year.  I can't wait!!
B001GCUO1Q|4.0|i love the comics. x mens always been my favorite series other than when i was little and i was all about superman. All the xmen movies are different than the comics. theyre comic inspired action movies BUT i love em. hugh jackman is so cool. Hes an awesome adaptation of wolverine. In this one i loved how they pulled in scott without really pulling him into it. I really like liev shreiber and was happy they picked him to play a young sabretooth. It was a fun movie. i watched it in two settings so im not giving it a full 5l Lets face it if it was the best thing ever i would have watched it all the way through.  Like all the others, when you match up this to Xmen first class which timewise fall close things just dont add up but like i said not to think on much. Not my favorite but the last comic movie i saw was Green Lantern and haha anythings a step up from that.
1932100660|5.0|This is the first book that has inspired me to change my eating habits. The author describes how his research changed his understanding of diet and disease. The precepts are well supported by studies referenced throughout the book. I highly recommend this book.
B004W89N72|3.0|As stated before it's a calendar. It's a very plain app for a not so great price not to mention that ithas no sync. Not worth the money.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it great app. to have happy got it games are fun and addicting once started to play and learned
006197806X|4.0|I fell in love with the alternation between past and present. Lena's character seems so real to me; hurt, hate, unknown strength, love. I wasn't sure how I felt about the introduction of Julian, but by the time the ending hit, my heart tore into two directions. Excited to read what this world, and the characters have to offer in the third book!
0811875555|5.0|Tangled is such a beautifully animated movie so when I got this as a gift from my family, I was ecstatic! Each page is masterfully drawn and it gives you the traditional art behind the animated movie.<br /><br />The details are amazing. I think the traditional stills and sketches captured more emotion and life than the animation! Plus, whenever guests see this book on my bookshelf, they go crazy over the art too. I'd highly recommend this for any fan of Tangled.
B004W89N72|4.0|This app is awesome it keeps me so organized I love it I know when events are coming up and when they are going to happen
B005LW5J9O|4.0|This is a nifty historical primer on Greco-Roman history through the Renaissance as well as the evolution of books.  It relates the life of Poggio Bracciolini quite well, but I thought the theory of Lucretius' \\"On the Nature of Things\\"  influencing modern thought and providing a \\"swerve\\" to our present day direction was a little thin.  An interesting read though . . .
B0078N2MTE|1.0|I could understand had he come out of the shelter and everything was gone, but this was ridiculous! long, drug out waste of time. How did they get 2 hours out of this? Are we able to eliminate stars? When you finally get to the end, (if your able to sit through it) still didn't show enough of what was happening. Very disappointed.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This has got to be one of the best blu ray upgrades I've ever seen, and the quality of the video and the set itself were amazing. I don't need to review the films themselves because if you're a fan, you already know the details. One thing I do recommend is to buy the set here on Amazon that has \\"[blu ray import]\\" in the title. The set is almost identical, yet instead of the cardboard case with sleeves you get in the US set (which is very prone to scratching both the sleeves and the discs) you get a hard plastic blu ray case that holds all 6 discs (the 4 films+2 bonus discs) and it does a much better job at holding the set together. Not to mention rather than a $45-75 price tag that the US version holds, I got a sealed import for 30 bucks.  I have tested the import set on both the PS3 and my blu ray player, and the discs work perfectly, as the blu rays are region free from this set. Having double dipped on this series (more like triple) I can say this is the best set I've had, and I recently sold my US edition single disc blu rays of Alien and Aliens to splurge and get this, since the single disc releases are the same discs you get in the set, I've checked. If you've ever purchased the single disc US blu ray releases you get the 2 versions of the film, but lack much of the MU-TH-UR features, deleted material, behind the scenes, etc that are found on disc 5 and 6. Because of the 60+ hours of bonus content indicated on the front I just had to upgrade and I'm extremely happy with this purchase and wish I made it sooner!
0060873027|2.0|Scientific impracticalities aside, the idea of exploring the alien world of insects and spiders at their own level is intriguing, and would no doubt be terrifying. I actually found the first part of the book to be fairly well written and interesting. But somewhere along the way, things went awry. Much of the dialogue in the second half of the book is trite and unrealistic. The final chapters, with the graduate students buzzing around in tiny airplanes like Snoopy, were laughably ridiculous and seemed like something from a spoof rather than a serious drama. I'm not sure if the downturn in the quality of the writing coincided with Michael Crichton's death, or if he is more or less responsible for this trainwreck in toto, but a trainwreck it is. I am generally a big fan of his work (Andromeda Strain, Jurassic Park, Sphere, Prey, etc.), but would place this one on the short list of Michael Crichton stinkers which would also include The Lost World and Timeline.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Although this was a free product for my kindlefire that I got for Christmas, as I play thru the different levels and try to improve my time == the game will lock up sometimes for no apparent reason.  So I have to sign out then sign back into the game and start the level over once again.  This just is more annoying than anything therefore, that is the reason for the low score.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|I love this movie because in many aspects is a reflection of my personality. This movie is about a semi retired master weapons craftsman that stays in the town of Castel Del Monte, Italy where he makes a custom weapon for actress Thekla Reuten.<br /><br />This is a very mellow movie, so if you are expecting an action movie, look another direction and watch Die Hard, Rambo or something. You are not going to get 2 million bullets a minute on this movie!!!<br /><br />THE AMERICAN is about an assassin that moves from Sweden to Italy and while he stays in Italy he falls in love with a call girl (Violante Placido) after a few dates and just when he is about to retire, he is killed at the very end by his own boss.<br /><br />George Clooney, as JACK/EDWARD, is very quiet, very private, introverted, loner and he doesn't trust anyone and I mean his own shadow.<br /><br />If you are in am mood for a mellow movie...this is the one for you. Otherwise, like many other reviewers, you will not get it or understand it.<br /><br />With an air of arrogance I can say that this again, IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. So don't expect a non stop action movie in the lines of RAMBO because is entirely the opposite.<br /><br />I'm not surprised why the average reviewer didn't get this movie. This was filmed EUROPEAN STYLE!! Enough said<br /><br />To me needles to say is just brilliant!!!<br /><br />RATING 10
B003JTHESA|5.0|Before I bought this album, I only had Iron Maiden CD's from their early years so this is my first \\"Newer\\" album. I had to listen to it twice for the whole album to really sink in. Since I grew up listening to the early tracks like \\"Run to the Hills\\" or \\"The Trooper\\", just to name a few, it was difficult to really get into the CD. But once it stuck, there are quite a number of great tracks on it. For example, the self titled \\"Final Frontier\\" and \\"The Alchemist\\" tracks can indeed hold up to the greatest hits. I have to say, this is one of those albums that every fan should have in their CD rack. So, if your a fan, or just like the 70's-80's Heavy Metal, then I would suggest this Album.
B004W89N72|1.0|you cant put in a note until the day before....the pictures show nothing on how to do it..... what are the colored streaks for..... JUST DONT BOTHER WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B004EPYZXK|3.0|This is a good film.  However the copy I received was zone coded for the United States when it should have been zone coded for the United Kingdom.  My DVD player would not accept it but I did manage to view it on my computer but had no sound track.  This product has been returned to the senders address.
1469984202|3.0|It is a stretch to call this story Science Fiction since the most advanced piece of tech is a roll of tape and it takes place in a hole in the backyard. The setting feels more like a fictional account of the Cuban Missle Crisis. That being said, this was an odd read. Being confined to a small silo with no outlet of any kind except walking up and down stairs... and everybody thinks that the place is too big and segregated (one guy never even leaves his room)?! Last I checked, agoraphobia was not hereditary (maybe it was a group of agoraphobics who started the war). In that sense, I did not want to relate to the characters as easily as I did. Overall, these character are too normal and familiar given that they were raised under the circumstances set forth in this collection. *Spoiler Alert*, if the Lynchpin Theory (someone survives the cleaning) means there will be war, why even have real time monitors looking outside?! If you want to keep people ignorant of something why dangle it in front of their faces everyday? Perhaps, there is some deep social commentary that I am flat out missing. Will have to wait for the Cliffnotes to truly appreciate this otherwise flawed story. Note: the author is a natural - I just found critical plot points to be difficult (coming from a guy who has read Piers Anthony stories about intergalactic dentists)...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so much fun. I love it. My kids love to play it too! Very addictive!!! I could play this game for hours. It is extremely fun and challenging.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I love Karen's writing and I have to say she does this story justice. There are still some unanswered questions at the end but I like they way it kept me guessing and thinking throughout the whole book.<br /><br />I would highly suggest the Fever series to anyone!
0891419063|5.0|I ordered a set of six WWII books from Easton Press. Among them was this one, \\"With the Old Breed.\\"<br />The other five books were good. This book was incredible.<br />No adjectives are really worthy of what this book describes.<br />Having no picture of the author this book made me form a mental picture of the Hammer. A heroic marine faced with indescribable horrors. I pictured a young, robust he-man type.<br />I turned the last page of this stunning account and there before my eyes was Sledge. A boy who looked as if he just walked out of a high school yearbook.<br />A boy.<br />Really made me think of who really fought this war. Young men...... Boys.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who can read. Riveting from beginning to end.<br />Wow!
B006TLFIAQ|4.0|Good action, faster pace, found movie interesting, not the same old plot lines, couple twist ant turns you wouldn't expect.  Great movie.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|The 25th Anniversary production of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" can only be described as a brilliant spectacle.  With a cast of 130 of the West End's finest performers, it is also a tour de force.<br /><br />From the moment that the brilliant Earl Carpenter (in a non-singing role as the auctioneer) opens the play with a rap of his gavel, the production holds your attention.  Hadley Fraser as Raoul and Ramin Karimloo in the title role are particularly noteworthy for the quality of their performances.  Wendy Ferguson's Carlotta is also absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Staging the production at Albert Hall made for some interesting challenges, including managing sets.  Digital screens bring us the opera house, the cemetery and more.<br /><br />Highly recommended for Phantom fans.
B004W89N72|3.0|Nice calendar but I was disappointed to see that there were none of my events in the calendar. It's blank!  It literally doesn't sync to anything.<br /><br />It's great if you choose not to use the stock phone calendar or google calendar. Otherwise it's kinda pointless.
0765357151|4.0|I listened to the audio book of I am Legend.<br /><br />The main character, Robert Neville, for some reason not completely known to him, is the last living man.  Everyone else has either turned into a vampire or has been killed by the vampires.  Robert is struggling day by day to survive while at the same time trying to figure out why he alone was not infected like everyone else.<br /><br />I loved how the author made this a post-apocalyptic vampire novel (and one quite original for its time...written in 1954), but the vampires are not the main focus of the story.  In fact, Robert hears them at night and hunts them during the day, but they really are in the background, at least until towards the end.  The story is really about Robert and his struggles with loss, despair, loneliness, and trying to keep his humanity in a world that is no longer human.<br /><br />The other short stories in this book were good also, but I Am Legend was by far my favorite.
B002S8AGZG|4.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. This purchase was part of my replace my \\"dead technology\\" favorite DVDs with blu rays. As much as I love this movie I would say don't scramble to get it on blu unless like me its under the $10 mark. The video quality is very noisy, blue skies look like they're swarming with bees. The behind the scenes extra is worth the previously mentioned price of admission though for sure.
B000M9BPEY|2.0|Let me just say for the record I love this movie, although this is not the purpose of this product review. I wanted to review the actual bluray instead, since most of the posted reviews are from the dvd version. I happen to own the dvd version of this film, and I must say I was very disappointed with the bluray edition. The sound quality is honestly excellent, but the picture quality is incredibly inconsistent. To be fair, the movie was shot with different film stocks and makes ample use of haze filters during flashback/fantasy sequences. That said, the reds are very oversaturated, which when coupled with the softness of the picture makes it lose any real sense of depth. In comparison the modern sequences with the son were shot in cooler darker tones and appear appreciably sharper, but the grain is overwhelming in certain scenes and makes the image appear incredibly dry. I was able to detect scanlines in one of the modern scenes as well. The jump back and forth in quality and texture was annoying for me, and I couldn't enjoy the movie up close. In general the presentation is either dark and dry or loose and blown out. In fact I prefer to watch the dvd which has more consistent color levels and less graininess (owing to the lost detail). Deeply disappointing from a fan's perspective. This bluray is also not special feature heavy, if you're a fan of that. If I could, I would give this version 2.5 stars for the attractive menu design and excellent audio.

0812973992|4.0|Although I had read reviews on this book and it has been on my read list for sometime; I was NO WAY prepared for the impact the characters and stories touched my heart & soul.  I read ALOT and this book reminded me that most of what I read and enjoy has been almost a waste of my time compared to this novel. This story revolves around Philipe Petit's high wire walk between the world trade centers that took place in the 1970's--another thing I loved about the book..the time & place. I cannot praise it enough.  I was moved to tears more than once as I read & there are quotes from this book in my journal...words I never want to forget.

B002FFVF1G|5.0|Rock and Doris were made for each other , hollywood legends , at a time when  hollywood had the ability to tell a story.
0385342063|4.0|I quite enjoyed this book.  The main character, Poppy, was very like able even though she was total ditz in the beginning of the book.  I liked how the author showed her maturity level rise throughout the book whenever she was challenged to look at her life by Sam.  The Sam character was drawn much fuller than Poppy's finance so the reader was lured into rooting for him as the winning love interest.  The mystery was a little contrived but without it there wouldn't have been enough plot line to sustain the book. All and all if you go into the book with the mindset that it is suppose to be a screwball romantic comedy you will not be disappointed.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I have watched this twice! what a great story and a very heartwarming movie.I loved this movie for the fact that it was based on a TRUE story and my love for animals.Richard Gere was Fantastic in this movie and the role he played was very inspiring. All I can say is get the movie and watch it! it is great a movie you will want to watch again and again..don't forget the tissues though!!

B004EPYZOO|5.0|Can't get enough Robert Rodriguez? Tarantino not turning out flicks fast enough? Latest Rob Zombie joint not out yet? You have to check this out, this is a movie lovers film, pure popcorn indulgence, nonstop action, cool story line, and just crazy entertaining and fun. This is one of my favorite films made in the last few years, it harkens back to the crazy over the top fun action films of the late 70's early 80's, there are some really awesome kills and just insane over the top scenes that you want to see over and over. For me this is definitely one for the collection not just a rental, it's a really cool flick.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Being a Reacher Creature I was delighted by this book. I have read all of Lee Child's books and was thrilled to find a character who could channel my inner-Reacher the way John Puller did. I see that quite a few reviewers are upset over the similarities between Reacher and Puller, but I found enough differences to be exciting and why I enjoy this type of story so much. Don't listen to the nay-sayers! If you like Jack Reacher, you will enjoy John Puller. Lee Child only writes one book a year so I hope Mr. Baldacci will write more John Puller novels. Besides, you have to like a guy with a cat named AWOL!

B003UESJH4|5.0|I purchased this DVD from a video store knowing that it was a masterpiece and I was not disappointed. Being keenly interested in British history and literature this film did more than just entertain me. It showed me that monarchs have their troubles too and sometimes have a lot of difficulty overcoming them. This is about a humble ordinary man who was able to do a tremendous service for the king and I'm glad the film was made and that this humble man's contribution to the success of the monarchy was not forgotten. -- Val Lull

B006UG90RM|1.0|I wanted to like this album, I even bought the most expensive version with the DVD included. VH is one of the core groups that made rock a part of life. I have also been a Diamond Dave fan for, well for longer than I have not been a Dave fan. Unfortunately the world changed and VH did not.<br /><br />With the talent of the VH family this could have been, well it could have been a lot of things, but it is not. Of course the technical execution is there, it is after all Eddie Van Halen. Of course there is excitement in the music, it is after all Diamond Dave. Unfortunately there is no connection between the excitement and the technical expertise. Eddie does his thing, Dave does his and the mixers worked really hard to blend the two, but it just did not work.<br /><br />The album is good reminder that you can put all the ingredients in a bowl, shake 'em, mix 'em, and bake 'em, yet end up with cake that you cannot eat. This cake is not ready. This is one of the few times I can say I want a refund and I wish I had bought the 2.99 MP3 download rather than the CD/DVD.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Buckle up girls... this is going to be a LONG one!<br /><br />To start, I'll say that when I started reading Shades of Grey, I was doing so with the idea that it was a paranormal romance. Where I got that idea I couldn't tell you. I kept reading and reading waiting for the other shoe to drop and reveal something other-worldly, but it never came. It may have turned out to be the polar opposite of what I THOUGHT I was reading, but I couldn't be happier! Before we go any further, I will throw out 'the warning' .. this book contains EXPLICIT sex, language, some violence, sad reflection of child abuse, and a SMBD theme. For those of you like me who don't know what SMBD means.. I'll sum it up - bondage, submissive/ dominance relationship, etc. This was a whole new world for me and I'm not ashamed to admit that I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />First, on the non-sex parts of the book... Ive often laughed out loud while reading, but E.L. James had me running to the bathroom before I had an accident many times! I also shed more tears than I could count, and WAY too many nights were spent by myself awake, alone with only the light of my e-reader to light my way until the sun came back up!<br /><br />This story is told from the point of view of our main character Ana. However, the author has this magical way of not only incorporating the play-by-play of what's happening, but shows us a look into the main characters mind.. by telling us all about the thoughts of her subconscious and \\"inner goddess\\" ... Basically a metaphor for Ana's shoulder sitting angel and devil. The \\"Inner Goddess\\" Is my favorite and I will carry that concept with me for the rest of my life!<br /><br />This story is fantasy, fairytale, and heart breaking reality all rolled into one! How many stories are there about the plain, poor girl with nothing special going for her who gets swept off her feet by her knight in shining armor and whisked away to live in a palace with all of her hearts desires available for the rest of her life? Well, switch that into the 21st century, make the knight in shining armor an insanely wealthy CEO, and give him some SERIOUS demons, and there you go!<br /><br />That's really all the further I can go without incorporating \\"the sex\\" into this review, because it's such an intricate part of the story! I'll be honest - there's a LOT of sex! Some of it is just for the fun of the read. (Don't be embarrassed ladies) However, this story could not possibly be told without it! As I said, SMBD is the theme here. Don't be shy... who hasn't fantasized about a little role-play in the bedroom? The point that I'm probably failing at making is that the sex tells a story! Our main male role Christian has a LOT of issues. His \\"lifestyle\\" in the bedroom is an expression of those and a coping mechanism, therapy if you will for the brutal early-childhood he suffered through. This works fine for him until he falls for the very virginal, very vanilla Miss Anastasia Steele. As for Miss Steele, not only has she never had sex, but a VERY indecent proposal from this easy on the eyes man is just too much for her! She, her subconscious and her \\"inner goddess\\" set off to see if this is a life she could ever really get involved in. What's meant to be a black and white formal agreement between two consenting adults becomes 'complicated' as feelings and emotions evolve. The black and white blur into \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" for all involved.<br /><br />Shortly after finishing this series, I caught a segment of The Today Show calling this series many things from \\"Women's secret fantasy\\" ... to a \\"Slap in the face of the women's movement\\" and stating that the \\"Violence on women\\" was appalling! Obviously in my opinion, those people are morons! The only violence on women in this book is 100% consenting adults and in the bedroom... it's fantasy! It's the whole pleasure/pain thing. Mind you, we're talking about spanking here... not domestic abuse! So let's just put that to rest right now! The famous television personality \\"Dr. Drew\\" admitted on air to having NOT read the series right before he threw it under the bus stating that anybody who takes pleasure in that type of activity is often the victim of child-abuse. Well, DUH! Our male role Christian is fifty-shades of f#$%-up because of what happened to him as a young boy! This is how he has come to deal with it.. but Ana is there to help him work it all through even more and heal his inner child! Ugh! That television segment made me SO angry because it painted this series in the wrong light! They made it seem like only lonely, horny women or sick puppies could enjoy this book... as though it were some sort of perversion. It's NOT! It's a wonderful tale of love, lust, complications, and growth!<br /><br />Many women would feel embarrassed to admit that they read and enjoyed such a racy series. NOT ME! I will admit that I was a little shocked though. If you don't believe that a story with a lot of sex can have real emotion- just ask my husband who saw the tears fall down my face! This beautiful, amazing tale was written by a WOMAN for WOMEN and I'd go as far as to say every man should read it too!

0140434089|5.0|\\"The Moonstone,\\" frequently cited as the first detective novel in English, catches up its characters and its readers in \\"detective-fever.\\" British troops steal the Moonstone, an enormous yellow diamond, from a religious statue in India in 1799 and bring it back to England as spoils of war, where it is acquired by John Herncastle. The diamond is believed to carry a curse. Herncastle's will leaves the diamond to his niece, Rachel Verinder, to be given to her on her 18th birthday, as revenge for Herncastle's family having disowned him. In 1848, family members and friends gather at the Yorkshire country estate of the Verinders to celebrate Rachel's birthday. Rachel's cousin, Franklin Blake, who is in love with Rachel, has been given responsibility for delivering the Moonstone safely to Rachel. Everyone is anxious about having the valuable jewel in the house instead of locked up in a banker's vault. Sometime between the night of the birthday party and the next morning, the Moonstone disappears from Rachel's room.<br /><br />Who stole the Moonstone? Was it the Indian jugglers in the neighborhood who are suspected to be disguised Brahmin priests who will stop at nothing to restore the diamond to its rightful place in India? Was it Rosanna Spearman, a supposedly reformed thief working as a maid at the Verinder estate? Was it one of the party guests? Was it Rachel herself? We discover the truth through a series of narratives by different characters, the most memorable of whom are the Verinder family butler and \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" devotee Gabriel Betteredge, the hilariously pious poor relation Miss Clack, lovesick Franklin Blake, and the outcast biracial Yorkshire doctor's assistant Ezra Jennings.<br /><br />Although I'm not usually fond of mysteries, \\"The Moonstone\\" is among my all-time favorites, and Wilkie Collins is perhaps the most under-appreciated author of the mid-19th century. His \\"sensation novels,\\" as they were called in their day, are far-fetched and \\"The Moonstone\\"is no exception. However, readers willing to try something different and be a little patient with Victorian writing will delight in the humor, plotting, pacing and characterization found in Collins' best work. He held remarkably forward-thinking attitudes about women, people of color and colonialism for his day. He loves to poke fun at, or offer stinging critiques of, conventional piety. His female characters are stronger, more complex and more interesting than those of his friend, mentor and contemporary, Charles Dickens. Although he can indulge in verbal padding, a common flaw of 19th century fiction published serially in popular magazines, Dickens is far the worse offender on that score. Compared to most Dickens (the brilliant \\"Great Expectations\\" excepted), Collins' work moves along as quickly as your favorite airport lounge bestseller.<br /><br />Even if you think you only like contemporary books, give \\"The Moonstone\\" a try. You'll be surprised at how modern it seems compared to most 19th century fiction. Spending time with the memorable characters as they solve the mystery of the Moonstone's disappearance is wonderful fun.

B003V4AK8E|5.0|I purchased this because I needed a wireless gamepad for playing Mame on a PC hooked up to the TV. I took a chance and guessed that because the transmitter/receiver was USB that it might just show up in Windows 7 as a normal joystick... Guessed Right! Works great! No driver, etc. needed! Shows up in windows joystick configuration with all axis and buttons completely usable. Currently using two of them and will be getting two more for 4 player old school gaming action. :)<br /><br />Also, to comment on the dead-zone I've heard people talk about...Makes me wonder if it's a Playstation issue / incompatability, because the issue is completely non-existent in windows. In the windows joystick configuration app there is a little crosshair that moves around when you move the analog stick and the movement of that crosshair in relation to the stick is completely linear (edge-to-edge) w/ no 'dead zone' what-so-ever.

B006OFN0SE|3.0|From the moment I heard that Clint Eastwood was working on this film I became eager for the release. I was particularly eager to see how Leonardo Dicaprio would handle both the role, and Eastwood's direction. Hoover the man was a controversial character full of personal peccadillos both documented and heavily speculated upon. With such a vast amount of conflicting information available, I was deeply intrigued to see the manner in which the data would be presented. His paranoia was legendary, as were his interactions and fundamental mistrust of several of the presidents under which he served.<br /><br />I didn't read much in the way of reviews either here at Amazon or in the media prior to viewing the film - I even eschewed watching the trailer - because I wanted to meet the film at \\"face value\\" as I had many of Eastwood's other directorial efforts. My opinions of the movie are therefore my own, and not based on the praise and/or criticisms of others that have viewed the movie.<br /><br />On the plus side, Eastwood doesn't sensationalize the allegations of homosexuality and cross dressing that would have made Hoover an easy target for exploitation. Such matters are presented in a manner that manages to make their possibilities a very realistic conclusion to be drawn, but doesn't accept them as fact. The one kiss that takes place with Hoover's longtime \\"partner\\" is rejected by J Edgar who demands that such a thing never be done again. Unlike \\"Milk\\" in which the viewer is constantly bombarded with the protagonist's sexuality, in J. Edgar the sexual inclinations are present as a part of the man, but not the driving focus of his life.<br />It is a delicate balance, but largely handled in a deft manner in the film.<br /><br />On the negative side of the ledger however, is the overall bleak nature of the production. The colors are a dull pallette of greys and drab hues, which leaves the eye little stimulation to help with the slow pacing of the story. Eastwood also jumps back and forth frequently, choosing to relate the story in more flashbacks than necessary instead of presenting Hoover's life in a linear manner. As a result of these two filmaking decisions, the viewer almost has to work too hard to maintain interest and keep track of the flow of the narrative.<br /><br />For people who lived through the Hoover years, or have taken even a cursory glance at the man's Wiki bio, there are few surprises here. In fact, to the movie's detriment, it is likely that many viewers will already know more about the man than is presented. I have enjoyed virtually all of Eastwood's prior directorial efforts, but this one was just too slow and dry for my taste. I was also pulled out of the film several times by the makeup. I'm not usually bothered by such things, but at times the methods used to artificially age the main characters was so caky-looking I kept expecting to see chunks of it break off.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very average biopic, but a surprisingly poor film when compared to the past efforts of almost all those involved in the project both in front of, and behind the camera. It represents a rare but fairly large weakness in Eastwood's almost perfect directorial resume.ack and forth frequently, choosing to relate the story in more flashbacks than necessary instead of presenting Hoover's life in a linear manner.

Reading books on my tablet is the main reason why I bought it.<br /><br />The main feature I've been waiting for is a lock/hide \\"security\\" type feature so not all of my downloaded books are viewable. Archive is a very poor substitute (free wifi has yet to be widely available). Also on my Toshiba Thrive the Sort Most Recent doesn't work unless I soft reset the device. I don't believe this was always the case.<br /><br />Additional improvements I'd like to see across all platforms are full app functionality with imported documents (e.g. bookmarking), the ability to add labels and organize my Library as I want, and Kindle Store Wish List within the app.<br /><br />Come on Amazon!

B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I saw this movie in a free screening prior to release.  It is much more than a movie--it is about as real to life as any SEAL movie ever produced.  This movie is most impressive because of its realistic action.  Secondly, it is impressive because it is a non-typical Hollywood product, i.e. not inherently anti-American or politically correct in storyline or undertones.  Although some may remark that the acting is weak, in actuality the fact that the cast members are not professional actors makes it more real even if it is not as polished.  The plot is fine although somewhat formulaic.  The bottom line is that this movie is special because it is about as real as it gets.  Forget Charlie Sheen's movie, \\"GI Jane,\\" or Marcinko's books--this movie is the real deal.

This book is slow, boring, and uninteresting. And I have a Nook so the footnotes are especially annoying. Had I borrowed this book from a library or friend, I wouldn't even bother with finishing it. But since I paid money for it, I feel like I have to keep trudging though it, but honestly, I can't wait for it to end. This book has been a huge disappointment.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This is one of those books that pull it together for you. A lot of what's in it you already know (e.g., automation can eliminate jobs, disruptive innovation can create jobs and even new economic ecosystems) but it's all pulled together in a taut, coherent argument. In the age of the 1%, it also brings more light than heat to the important issue of why disparities in wealth and well being are increasing. For about the money and time you might spend buying a latte and leafing through last Sunday's Times while you drink it, you could be reading something that will reshape your perspective.

0345529057|5.0|The Game of Thrones<br /><br />In the book \\"The Game of Thrones\\" by George R.R. Martin, the author shows his brilliance in how he writes this fabulous depiction of medieval times. He shows how the characters lived, in there every day life's, how the abided by there rules, and laws that they died and lived by.<br />Martin makes everything he writes about so realistic. He describes the characters' lives in the times they lived, making you feel as if you are apart of that time and experiencing everything that is going on with the characters.<br />The twist of the plots in his book, keeps your interest because you never can predict what will happen to the characters. No one in his book is safe. The character who you think is going to be around for a long time, usually moves away, gets hurt, or killed. The king and his closest servants, who you would think are safe and secured from harm, you become amazed how they are not.<br />This is how Martin keeps your interest up, he gives a twist to the plot just enough not to bore you, and at the same time keep you reading so you can find out what happen.<br />Martin also is a master in describing the beautiful and picturesque country side magnificently. The author also keeps your interest in the book, because you want to see what the castles are like and his magnificent description.<br />The suspense is just thrilling. If you are a person who likes an action filled story that keeps great book series to read.

B006PHD0RW|1.0|I really liked this game and would like to continue playing it. However, after completing about 40 levels, all my progress disappeared. The history completely cleared. I started over, but after completing approximately the same number of levels, it happened again. I'm not interested in starting over once more, so I'm finished with this app. Too bad. It was fun.
0810989956|5.0|I got this book for my second grader for Christmas and he loves it!! He carries it around with him, Even to school. He's had it for 2 months now and still loves it. The questions and fill-in-the-blanks are fun and creative. I reccommend to any kid, even if they dont know much about \\"The Wimpy Kid\\" series. Actually this DIY book really boosted his interest even more to the book series.  I will be ordering him another one for next year and then keeping them for him to look back on and have funny memories of his school years!
6305428352|5.0|It was a FULL story, bringing me back to my High School Band days.  Early '70's.  Although we had a band with numbers up into 200 plus students, I recall our energy in both marching along with the 1812 Overture in concert!  We were called Band Fags in the day!  This movie brings forth the human element, teacher vs student.
B007CGLRWA|2.0|The conceit of this movie, a supposedly gritty, real-life look at American public schooling, is that at-risk teenagers are hardened, terrifying criminals-in-training whose only hope is for savvy white people to swoop down into their lives and save them. This old, deeply ingrained narrative, is not helping anyone. The idea that teachers are these noble, infallible heroes who should be given a medal for even setting foot in the war zones that are public schools doesn't leave much room for sympathy with the students themselves.<br /><br />When Lucy Liu screams at a blase young woman (her very attitude is seen as reprehensible, when in reality, what teenaged girl isn't blase?) with all F's whose plans for after graduation include modeling and being in a band, calling her a shallow, disgusting creature with no ambition, it's filmed as a moment of catharsis for this poor educator at her wit's end; as a teacher myself, I found it appalling, as with many other scenes where teachers get the best of their no-good students.<br /><br />There's no accountability here for the role adults play in the lives of troubled youth, no understanding for why these young people act the way they do. Instead, this is a sensationalist view of schools by someone who doesn't know a lot about them. Yes, at-risk students are angry, often aggressive, and often don't have much respect for authority figures. But there's more to them than that, and it takes more than a white hero spouting tough love to change their lives and their attitudes. They need the support and understanding of a whole team of adults who are willing to take responsibility for the roles they play in their lives; with teachers like these, who are so embittered that they basically despise the sight of their own students, it's no wonder they're so miserable, and Tony Kaye's lens is an extension of this hateful gaze.<br /><br />I gave this two stars, rather than one, because of the many excellent actors who were involved in this film. Adrien Brody's performance was one of the only things that kept me watching a movie I found so problematic.
