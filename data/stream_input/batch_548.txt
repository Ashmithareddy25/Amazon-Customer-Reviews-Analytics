B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The reason why this album got 4 stars and a half is because there was two songs that I didn't really like (one wasn't even a song, it was an intro) I'd thought I'd give this 5 stars instead... this is not SOAD's best as everyone would tell you but it does have SOAD's most popular song in it (BYOB). Wasn't for that song I woundn't like SOAD. Anyways here's the song ratings <br /> <br />1: Soldier Side: 2/10 Ermmm it's an intro and I don't like intros... worth skipping <br /> <br />2. BYOB: 9/10 This song rules. I love this song mainly for the chorus (can't understand half of the song)Good instruments and vocals. <br /> <br />3. Revenga : 8/10 This song is hard to rate cause it's not as heavy as SOAD usually is... but it's still really great. Heard this on the radio one time. <br /> <br />4. Cigaro: 10/10 This song is great and hilarious! Definitly my 2nd favorite. It goes like this \\"my c**k gets much bigger than yours\\". <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video: 8/10 Great song but gets repetive. Sounds somethin like from the wild west. <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song: 7/10 Ermmm... ends sorta abruptly is my complaint plus it's short... but it's still good while the song rolls... but in the end it just leaves you with a bitter taste, definitly not reply value <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography: 5/10 If there wasn't Soldier Side this would be my least favorite song. I know there's a lot of people who like this song but... it's sorta boring to me... I'm sorry. <br /> <br />8. Question! 8/10 This song is good. Somethin you can sing along to. Sometimes there are parts where it feels like timing is off tho but the heavyness makes up for it. Sorta has a mexicanish vibe. <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue: 10/10 Who coundn't like this song? It is wonderful! I love it! The chorus will definitly get stuck in your head. <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood: 9/10 Good song. Only thing mentionable here is there's a techno like theme. It makes this song very unique.<br /> <br />11. Lost In Hollywood: 10/10 This is my favorite song off the album. I love it so much! Give it time to grow on you (didn't like it first 3 listens) then you'll definitly love it:). It's the longest song (somewhere over 5 mins long) and goes by slowly and beautifully ending the album.

What do you guys want, Ringo to stop by your home for a beer...... ?<br /><br />This is history and did you not see the price.<br /><br />I remember seeing the film on the day of its release in my native England - it was in our local \\"bughouse\\" and I wouldn't trade that memory but this DVD is NOW and superb.<br /><br />David

B00000K3D4|5.0|This is one of my favorite childhood movies, that showcases mind-boggling puppetry, and that imparts real life lessons. This movie is about taking responsibility for one's actions, not falling prey to emotional manipulation (or at least overcoming it when it does happen), searching for creative solutions instead of obvious answers, the true meaning of friendship, overcoming fears, and trading childhood fantasy for adulthood. The characters are exaggerated charicatures yet have depth and are based on personality types one encounters in real life. Considering the movie is about goblins, it is not at all scary (I was scared of my own shadow as a child and this never gave me a moment of anxiety) so is perfect for kids of all ages, but I'm not sure how fun this would be for the average adult who did not watch it as a child.
B0000AM6IY|3.0|well,here's another review for you all to hate.i thought this was very overrated.come on people,this isn't a great movie.it has promise yes,but it made me so angry.natalie wood as a latino? didn't convince me.plus it's not even her singing.SPOILER AHEAD.when Tony kills Maria's brother,Bernado,she still takes him in and makes love to him?! the message is that love is stronger than family?! not in my eyes and it shouldn't,nor would i think,that it would be in any other peoples eyes and heart.i know it's just a movie,but come on.than when Tony gets shot at the end,instead of calling for help,they all stand around looking at him die,and of course maria breaks out into song.you can actually see Tony saying,\\"shut up and help me!\\" i give this 3 stars because alot of the movie is beautiful,and the dancing and arobatics are great.but the movie almost always sinks when it focuses on Tony and Maria.some of the songs are good.the one where the latinos sing about \\"living in america\\" is the best,and the one where the Jets sing about being crazy is also good,as well as Maria's \\"i'm so pretty\\".otherwise the rest of the songs,in my opinion,are throwbacks.some of the imagery works like when Tony and Maria first meet and everyone else is blurred.this had great promise to be the great film that everyone says it is,but because of the obvious problems,i'll never be convinced otherwise.if you want a great musical,watch Yankee Doodle Dandy or Grease.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Upon first listen, this CD became an instant favorite. Everything is right on the money with this album. Singer/Guitarist/Composer Jari Maaenpa is a genius madman with super speedy thrash riffs, blistering virtuosic solos, lush keyboard arrangements and catchy leads/hooks/choruses, plus his black metal screeching vocals that put any black metal vocalist to shame, not to mention his manly/viking singing (as opposed to the usual pansy power metal singing that annoys to no end), is there anything this man can't do? Well, its probably drums (which are played by the drummer from Rotten Sound, Kai Haihto, and extremely well, I might add...). This cd flat out destroys the competition (thats right, Bodom can't even hold a flame to these guys, as much as I like them, and Alexi is an amazing guitar player, Bodom's music is straight up cheese metal, which has its place, but its nothing compared to these guys). Wintersun have been able to craft an album that is probably closest to perfect that albums can get. The only gripe I have is with the last song \\"Sadness and Hate\\", its a 10 minute opus devoid of ANY solos, which is a shame because Jari is an incredibly fast, clean, and virtuosic guitar player and the song could definitely benefit from some solos, seeing as it drags on a bit. Other than that, any one looking to hear what a hybrid of black metal, melodic death metal, thrash metal, power metal and folk metal would sound like (done right), look no further. Alternatively, any one looking for just plain out epic and emotional metal, pick this up too. A criminally overlooked album, you won't be dissapointed, trust me. <br /> <br />Personal Favorite track: Starchild.
1573223026|5.0|This book is wonderful. Made me snort w/ laughter, I can't imagine reading it after listening to the audio book, I really connected to the characters.
B000B8QEYC|1.0|Less Than A Pearl:  <br />The album opens with Enya's typical soundscape, a chorus comprising entirely of herself. Where she normally just vocalized her way through the first track of every CD (with the exception of Watermark, that rare gem), Eithne decides to use lyrics. But instead of aiming for Gaelic or equally obscure languages, she decides to sing in Loxian, a made-up language that her lyricist created for her book \\"Water shows the hidden heart\\". Curiosities aside, the first track is basically 3:44 minutes of (very) sedate tribal chanting. It is, in its essence, a watered mixture of \\"Ebudae\\" and \\"The Longships\\", without the distinctive identity that made those songs memorable. It is a notable effort, however, but at this point the discerning listener feels a little wary-- he may fear that this album may earn the title of \\"The Further Adventures Of A Day Without Rain\\". <br /> <br />The CD spins, and we move to the second track... <br /> <br />Amarantine:  <br />The first three seconds of the track give one a false hope: Has Enya decided to experiment with asian scale tonality? Could she be so bold, and follow up on the promise of what she could do with a small effort, such as \\"Tea House Moon\\", a song that showed she COULD go somewhere interesting, but she didn't really want to. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, no. This composition is definitely a sister of \\"Only Time\\", but the melancholy has been replaced by luv. \\"Aramantine, Amarantine, Amarantine, Love is love is love\\", wisely says Enya (at this point, Roma Ryan has probably had enough of whatever she was smoking). A sleepy ballad in 4/4 time with an abuse of pizzicato, there's nothing bold or innovative here, except -perhaps- that Enya decides to visit a range of her voice she completely left out of her previous album... unfortunately, it's rather breathy and weak, definitely no Loreena Mckennit whose silvery , folksy soprano is always a joy to hear when she goes into the mid-high range of her voice (which she does quite often). Enya should take a singing lesson or to to strengthen her voice in the upper register before doing things like these. <br /> <br />This song is 'pretty' in the same way cute little porcelain statues of boys and girls are pretty: They don't add anything of substance, and you probably wouldn't notice them by themselves, but they make pretty ornaments and are often used to hide holes in the decor. So far, Enya hasn't managed to impress -and for an album that's produced five years after its original, that can't be good.  Although \\"Only Time\\" was far from being as captivating as anything in Watermark, or the singles from \\"Shepherd Moons\\" and \\"Memory of Trees\\", it still had more personality than the single of this particular CD. Again, it feels like nothing new, and more a rehash of an old formula. <br /> <br />On to the next track: <br /> <br />It's In The Rain: <br />The song opens with a little introduction featuring the over-familiar Enya arpeggios in the synthetizers, telling us that the piece is going to be another slow affair, but this time in 3/4 time. <br />Funny enough, the lack of the Army Of Enya  humming away , and a more clearly projected voice make this song much more personable than Amaranthine (the chorus kicks in at the second stanza, but it's bearable). <br />Just like the previous two songs, this one is written in A-B-A-B format, which can get rather tiresome.  Knowing this, she introduces a small transition at 2:47, which leaves the listener hoping for a modulation so that the song can continue in a different key and thus gain a little more dynamic momentum... <br /> <br />Unfortunately, hoping is all we do, as Enya lets the little transitive phrase toy around with the possibility of a new tonality and then flop down to the initial key. Enya's never going to even reach classical composer stature, but at least she should have known better than this. We're on track three and we still haven't seen anything interesting or beautiful happening yet. <br /> <br />With heavy heart, we move to track four... <br /> <br />If I could be where you are: <br />A little simple ditty that's not very interesting. Enya's done this before, and much better than this: \\"Angeles\\", \\"On Your Shore\\", \\"Evening Falls\\", \\"Evacuee\\" are compositions done in the same style that \\"IICBWYA\\" is cut from: A melancholic, lilting vocal line and minimalistic accompaniment. Whereas the aforementioned compositions had a certain spirit to them, this one feels quite vapid. <br /> <br />It also should be mentioned that the orchestration has grown increasingly poor since The Memory of \\"Trees\\": both \\"A Day Without Rain\\" and \\"Amarantine\\" feature a greatly reduced range of instruments, and this is one of the factors that hurts the album. A masterful composer can work with a chosen and small number of instruments, but Enya can't. As a result, a lot of vitality from the previous albums (granted, this is Enya, so sedate vitality) is missing here. <br /> <br />On to the next track: <br /> <br />The River Sings:  <br />Ebudae. That's the first impression I had when listening to this track. That's not necessarily a bad thing. For the first time since I turned the album on, I'm interested. This track gives us an Enya that's flirting a little with percussion of a less restrained nature. Only a little bit. But we've seen how beneficial this is to her with \\"Storms In Africa II\\", the english version with the added african percussion. Enya should really look into that, and she honestly should not be afraid to expand her repertoire of instruments and rythms.  <br /> <br />Long Long Journey: <br />This is another 4/4 ballad, slightly more lively. The whole thing sounds like an Anglican anthem. A military marching drum does liven it up a bit. The track is not very special, but definitely an improvement over what came before (with the exception of The River Sings).  <br /> <br />Sumiregusa: <br />I can only describe this track as impressionist. It's certainly trying to conjure up a certain imagery, in between Enya singing in Japanese. However, it lacks any distinctive japanese atmosphere due to Enya's adherence to her own typical tonalities and chord structures, so the effort is a wasted one. The result is a track that, again, is 'pretty', but nothing special. (For an excellent example of how to do it correctly, see Freddie Mercury's \\"La Japonaise\\" with Montserrat Caballe, the album \\"Barcelona\\"). She does try a few interesting things, vocally, which makes it all the more painful because one wishes over and over that Enya let her hair down, one finds oneself wishing that she weren't afraid to experiment-- with the technology, dedication, and company on her side, she could truly be churning out some innovative and beautiful masterpieces, like the freshness of \\"Shepherd Moons\\" in comparison to \\"Watermark\\", but all she does is compose in circles! She's perpetually stuck in \\"A Day Without Rain\\". <br /> <br />Someone Said Goodbye: <br />A little surprise. This is as close to a popular ballad that Enya has ever gotten. Although I know it should be rather a sad thing when you're surprised that she's actually using chords in the piano and not arpeggios... but there you go, she does. The piano line under her singing at the beginning is distinctively independent- until it joins her in homophony for the chorus. This song teeters between traditionally Enya, and Enya trying a few new things. I like it. I'm not crazy ga-ga over it, but I like it. Please, Enya, try harder, go further, challenge yourself as a composer.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, I'm losing count of how many songs deal with loss or heartbreak. Something tells me this album is a little more personal than you'd think. <br /> <br />A Moment Lost: <br />The arpeggios are back. Damn. What's more, she's getting her heart broken again. This song is very irish ballad-like, in an Enya sort of way. It didn't do much for me, but it's 'pretty', again. <br /> <br />Drifting: <br />Arpeggios, again. The first few seconds sound like a rehash of \\"Oriel Window\\", but then it becomes a little more interesting when the cello kicks in. Incidentally, she's using a broad brushstroke version of the \\"Imagine\\" chord progression, which works. I definitely like the use of the cello here, but I'm still wishing for a little more individuality for the instruments, perhaps a little solo here and there, writing in a concerto-sonata form, at least?  <br />Then, the Army Of Enya hums in, a little modulation happens and then we return to theme A with the cello and piano (with faint strings in the background) in the original key. This formula doesn't bother me as much here as it has in the previous tracks. This is a still piece where nothing happens, but at least she makes the nothing pleasant and engaging. So far, this is the only track I've contemplated returning to. <br /> <br />Amid The Falling Snow: <br />Back to a typical Enya ballad. This means: <br />-Arpeggios in the piano. <br />-Single notes on the strings, with faint touches with the arch. <br />-Lullaby/Anthem-like melody waltzing its way through the song. <br />-Army of Enyas providing backup, doing nothing too interesting outside of vocalizing and humm humming along. <br /> <br />That being said, this little ballad works. It has a charming little feel to it, wintery and childlike. It's charming, nothing new, again, but it's a charming little song. <br /> <br />Water Shows The Hidden Heart: <br />Enya sings in Loxian again. <br />This, I have to say, is the better track in the CD.  It has three sections: Theme A, Theme B, and the third section moves into polyphony. Theme A and theme B are the typical lilting Enyaesque themes, nothing too daring as far as rythm and melody goes.  <br />So far, the structure goes: A - B - A  <br /> <br />The surprise comes as the third section, or C, dawns.  <br />At 2:58, the polyphony begins. This is what Enya should spend more time developing, it shows a beautiful play ofvoices and it shows a tiny smidge of what Enya would be capable of if she really put her thinking cap on.  <br />Unfortunately, this moment lasts all too little and at 3:40 we're back to theme A and then the conclusion. The ABACA makes this piece a little Rondeau. <br /> <br />And then, the album ends... unfortunately, with the dissatisfying taste of dissapointment. This album is, indeed, \\"The Further Adventures Of A Day Without Rain\\". For a second time, Enya's trying to write with a dried-up pen... it's quite clear that the formula that worked before is no longer working for her, what comes out is dull and uninspired, with brief moments that shine with promise but that pass by, ignored. At this point, style has definitely won over substance. In five years from now, will Enya have learned the lesson and will she have experimented enough to bring freshness to the now-stale \\"Enya Formula?\\" <br /> <br />We can only hope so.  <br /> <br /> <br />Overall? 1 star out of 5. Shame on Enya. We've SEEN her do better with Watermark, we know she can innovate as in Shepherd Moons. Therefore, she has no excuse. Back to the piano, dearie.
B0000027F8|5.0|I'm shocked to find how many reviews of this CD are recent. I, too, recently began to listen to the CD when I started playing guitar and really loved the song \\"Waiting(Reprise)\\". The lyrics are telling and thoughtful...and the acoustic guitar is fantastic. I then began listening to the rest of the CD and was blown away. As with the other reviewers, I believe all songs on the CD are masterful. Even the clubby songs like Freedom 90 have deep lyrics. Listen to it again or pick it up if you missed it the first time around...I did!
068983571X|5.0|An absolute classic which includes some of the more memorable characters and setting in any murder mystery.  This book focusses more on eloquent Watson, which is a good choice since he is the character readers can relate to.  Conversely, Holmes' extraordinary deductive reasoning powers make him the \\"superhero\\" of the story at just the right times.  The setting of the \\"Grimpen Mire\\" is perfect for a murder mystery: ancient hut relics, deadly bogs, and even an escaped murderer.<br /><br />My only complaint is that there is not much suspense when it comes to the ending, since Holmes of course is always a step ahead and he clues the reader in perhaps earlier than necessary.  But overall this is a wonderful story and clearly a very influencial work.

B00000HZH7|5.0|I first came across this band by buying metal massacre 6 on cassette around '85 and had never heard anything like it in my life.  I was hooked.  Terrified by the satanic imagedary, haunted mainly by the vocals of Jeff Becerra, and the guitar work of Larry LaLonde, before he aged a bit and forgot his roots in some band called Primus.  I purchased Seven Churches and was blown away.  They were the originators of Death Metal as far as I was concerned, playing the most sloppy, yet extremely tight insanity that the world ever had heard.  Don't play this CD's the first time you bring a girl over, however, she may think you are a devil worshipping pot smoking drunken lunatic, and who knows?  She could be right.
B000002J20|5.0|Easily one of the finest pieces of music ever conceived. Along with Olias of Sunhillow, Awaken, Close to the Edge, Wondrous Stories and Madrigal. This is music for souls who want to go inside and see face to face the source. If you don't get the lyrics, I understand, but as a mystic one can see where Jon has been and where he is going. If you read the writings of the mystic saints, past and present, you will see the same landscape that Jon writes about. Saints like; Kabir, Hafiz, Shams-i-Tabriz, Rumi, Tukaram, Paltu, Sarmad, Mira Bai, Tulsi, Bulleh Shah, Nanak, Arjan, Sawan Singh and many others, that spoke of the internal 'landscape' and it sounds like Yes lyrics. This background will give you a greater appreciation for Jon's lyrics; and when someone says that they are confusing, pompous, silly or worse yet, meaningless one can only fold their hands and wish peace to be upon the heads of our brothers and sisters who 'having eyes do not see'. Please forgive me for sounding pompous myself, sinner that I am, but stranded as I am on an internal desert island this music gives me great comfort. Pound for pound the finest band ever! With Love.

1577312082|5.0|I highly recommend this. I've never been a big believer in reading or listening your way to a better life, but this CD has truly made a remarkable difference for me.   <br /> <br />I think that many people misunderstand Tolle's ideas because they've read the book, rather than listened to the audio CD.  They are worlds apart.  The CD is Tolle himself speaking, and it is very powerful.  His presence and enlightened state is obvious in his tone and energy alone, and the words are delivered in a more comprehensible, digestible way.   <br /> <br />For those who say Tolle's approach to the past is misguided, I think they misunderstand what he has said.  For example, one reader writes:   <br /> <br />\\"I disagree with him about the past because it often contains unreleased trauma that directly impacts our life in the present moment. We may find for example that we have severe judgments about ourselves and other people, or that we have volatile mood swings and we may not know why. By accessing and then releasing past trauma we have a better shot at living the present moment as it is, instead of how it is distorted by our defenses, moods, and judgments, almost all of which are the result of early childhood conditioning. If you accept Tolle's approach, the past goes unexamined because it doesn't count. But you are the past and the more you know that past-I mean truly know who you are instead of your stories about who you are-the greater your possibility of having an authentic experience in the present moment.\\"  <br /> <br />Tolle does not recommend to forget the past, ignore the past, or leave it unexamined.  He simply does not recommend that be your focus.  He acknowledges that pain and suffering are unavoidable and that we must move through them.  His recommendation for dealing with the past is to stay in the present.  Indeed, if you have an unresolved issue or trauma from the past, it will undoubtably surface in the present, in the form of thoughts, memories, feelings, pain, behavior, etc.  That is unavoidable if you stay present.  Then you can be present with those things until you move through or past them.  Many people are afraid to handle it that way because they are afraid of the ways past trauma will impact their future life... but of course, neither the fear nor the imagined future have anything to do with the present.   <br /> <br />It's true that dealing with past trauma requires a great deal of presence, and often faith, and can often be best aided by a very aware counselor (consider those who have trained at the Alchemy Institute in N. California)... but it is well worth trying.  In those moments when time, past and future disappear, life can be incredible and peaceful.   Of course, like anything, it takes practice.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|There's not a weak album on the track, with the exception of Don't Bother, which has a weak chorus. I love the songs she transferred from Oral Fijacion, and the new ones are excellent too. I just hope she releases a new single soon - Dont bother is a bit of a flop.
B00005T30L|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is a very interesting movie. As tacky as this sounds, there are no good words to describe it. I could try saying it's \\"weird\\", \\"real\\", \\"beautiful\\", or any other word, but none of them would actually mean what I think of it.<br /><br />I watched it, in the first place, because I admire Scarlett Johansson (who plays Rebecca), due to her incredible acting skills. But, in a couple of minutes, I almost forgot about her, amazed by the shockinly honest script and a visual impact so real that could only be fake.<br /><br />The simple coming-of-age story, about Enid, a girl who's just graduated from High School and doesn't know what to do with herself, and her complicated relationships, is just... sincere. Not in a subtle way. She has typical problems, such as her troubles with her best friend, Rebecca, her father, Josh, the cute guy, and Seymour, a man as awkward as she is.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, I'm not able to describe it in words, so I will just recommend something: Watch it.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|The CD hasn't left my car player since I bought it and I could watch the DVD every day.  What an awesome performer Mr. Buble is.  His voice is just incredibly smooth and flawless.  It's wonderful to see young performers who appreciate the song stylings of the master songwriters of the standards.  It's also wonderful to listen to someone who actually sings.  His phrasing is excellent and his tonal quality superb.  I'm loving this.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|The music is great. The copy protection is not. J-Records is a subsidiary of Sony BMG. If you trust that the copy protection program on this CD is safe, then by all means buy the CD. You might want to do a web search for \\"Sony BMG rootkit\\" first though.
0345440900|5.0|I read Spock, I read Sears (until I couldn't take it any more), and when my daughter was about 2 weeks old, I read Hogg. Wow. I wish I had read this before she was born. Like all baby books, you take what works for you; having said that, this is the closest thing to an owner's manual that I have found. I was flailing and guessing at first (cry=hunger), and this book helped me figure out what my baby was really trying to tell me. We used the cry-decoder charts a lot - these helped me stop nursing unnecessarily every hour (it turns out she was really just tired or had a tummyache). The routine is also a godsend - eat, activity, sleep. More explanation of what to do when a baby deviates (eat, activity, eat with skipped nap) would help, but you can find that in the second book. <br /> <br />This book is pro-family by being both pro-baby and pro-parent. Tracy Hogg was one of the only baby book authors who recognizes that in order to give the best possible care, you need to satisfy your own needs too (sleep, some time to yourself, etc.) As the old saying goes, \\"if mom's not happy, nobody is happy,\\" and this approach allows Mom (or Dad, Grandparent, etc) to have her own life too.  If you're not comfortable with that and feel that you need to really give up yourself for your child, then this book probably won't work for you. <br /> <br />I buy this as a shower gift/new baby gift for everybody. I just wish I had read it before I had my baby!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The longest 90 minutes in history came to a close when this horrifying excuse for cinema finished on my DVD player. I'm not exaggerating here: I removed the shrink-wrap, watched the movie, and put it up for sale in the span of two hours. This from someone who never sells any DVD unless I've picked up a \\"deluxe edition\\" and need to get rid of the old version. I couldn't imagine a deluxe version of this: two discs of pure drivel instead of one? Where do I sign up?    Early on in this movie, Napoleon is watching his uncle's old football video. He says, \\"this is, like, the worst video ever\\". That, my friends, is the sweet embodiment of irony. You see, at worst, anything else could only possibly be the second worst video ever. That particular low bar has been set by the very film that contains the line, and it's not likely to be displaced by anything. Ever.    Maybe I just don't get it. Perhaps I'm a cinema snob--someone who actually likes to have things like plot, dialogue, acting, interesting characters, humor, and enough entertainment to avoid slipping into a coma when it comes to movies. If none of those things matter to you, saddle up and ride this broken-legged horse that needs to be euthanized. However, if you are capable of individual thought, enjoy movies that actually have some effort put into them, or hell, even if you're just cultured enough to proclaim Rob Schneider movies as \\"awesome\\", you are waaaaaaay above this particular disgraceful clunker. Consider yourself warned: steer clear. But if you don't believe me (or if you're one of the legions sure to rate this review as \\"not helpful\\"), feel free to buy my copy.    ADDENDUM: Not 10 minutes after I finished posting this, my copy for sale was snapped up. It's a sad commentary on society, but hey, God bless capitalism.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|Oscar nominee DIANE LANE (Unfaithful, The Perfect Storm, Under The Tuscan Sun\\" really shines in \\"MUST LOVE DOGS\\"! This is a very good movie that is very smart, very funny, and manages to avoid the usual rom-com cliches. The acting is top-notch with DIANE LANE in great form and JOHN CUSACK as charming as ever. An all-star support cast is also on hand. <br /> <br />All in all it is a very enjoyable and entertaining film that is funny and touching in equal measure. Highly recommended!
B000035P7X|4.0|One of many things that struck me about this movie was how much Dylan and his friends as a group look and talk a lot like the people I know. It felt like a life line between young people now and young people then. We're still all doing the same thing. Dylan was 23 when the movie was shot, and I'm 23 now, so it was interesting to see what he was like then; his youth and passion in full force, and so much in the moment, and this was 40 years ago. <br /> <br />It's kind of depressing, actually. Because afterwards you want so badly for there to be a young artist like that now.  <br /> <br />I saw this movie for the first time earlier this week. I've listened to Bob Dylan casually for a couple of years, but have recently gotten really into his music. I don't think that he's rude in the film like some people have said. I thought he was hilarious and bratty with the science student, and really trying to get through to the Time magazine reporter.  <br /> <br />Actually they explained his attitude a little in the commentary; the British reporters who came to interview him didn't even know who Joan Baez was; they really didn't know what they were talking about. Now, wouldn't YOU want to mess with people like that? Especially if these same reporters were calling you the voice of a generation?
B00063F8B2|5.0|With 14 tracks that are just as magical as the film (and the picture book by Chris Van Allsburg from which it was inspired,) \\"The Polar Express\\" is a must have soundtrack for the holidays!<br /><br />Tom Hanks himself performs two of the films fun scores with back up choirs of children and adults, \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" sung by two of the film's main characters, is a very sweet song. There's a \\"rockin'\\" song from Steven Tyler and \\"Believe\\" (the movie's theme) performed by Josh Groban is an absolutely beautiful song with a simple, heartwarming message. Josh Groban's voice is perfect for this song; very pure and soothing. The instrumentals by Alan Silvestri are just as amazing-- \\"Suite from the Polar Express\\" is fantastic!<br /><br />What I love most about this c.d. is the variety of Christmas music included. Classic Christmas songs from timeless artists including Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra make this album all the more worth purchasing. This is one Christmas album that has something for kids from 1 to 92. Not only will you have fun singing along to familiar holiday tunes, but you will also be inspired by new songs and instrumentals, and most definitely full of Christmas spirit!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I know John might have \\"sold out\\" his roots and broke into the music scene with his pop-rock, baby faced ballads that caused all 12-17 year old girls to put up a poster of him, or vote for his videos on TRL, but look where it got him. He's now rich famous, got a couple of Grammys and established himself as a true pop star. He can do what ever he wants. But he's thrown that all away, its behind him now. Anyone who does that really has something to prove. If you've seen a Mayer show then you've experienced whats been bottled up inside John since his pop debut, a talented guitar player with deep lyrics, sophisticated whit, blazing solos, and a seemingly rocky past with some women. Now I love the old gritty blues, but I for one think its about time someone threw somthing new into the blues world besides a couple of repeated phrases and hammer-on fill-ins. Mayer takes what he's learned from his long time blues meantors and shows what he's got: a new style that shows his dymanics, and passion for playing. This is just John Mayer having fun, and doing what he loves, so love or hate it he's not changing, I dont think he cares what you say. Sorry to all the \\"Room for Squares\\" fans, but just keep that album on repeat b/c its the last your getting. TRY! is John telling what he has to say, now its no where near the blues greats, but its a damn good start...
6304806434|4.0|Great premise for an action movie - put \\"every creep and freak in the universe on one plane\\" (they're transferring a bunch of murderers, rapists, and arsonists in one fell swoop.)  Cuff `em to the aisle seats.  The really bad guys, like Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), are locked down in cages along the walls.  The really really bad guy, Garland `The Marietta Mangler' Greene (Steve Buscemi,) is trussed up like Hannibal the Cannibal and treated by the wary transport guards like a rabid rottweiler.  Into this stew of degenerates add one Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage,) ex-Army Ranger who is going home after serving a seven-year sentence for murder.  Of course, Poe killed the man with his bare hands when the man, along with a couple other drunken thugs, jumped Poe and his wife in a parking lot.  The ex-Ranger, as the sentencing judge informs us after Poe refuses to cop a dishonorable guilty plea, is a killing machine.  So Poe is flying home a free man, to see for the first time his seven-year-old daughter.  You see, his still-faithful wife was pregnant when the killing occurred, and Poe wouldn't allow his child to see her Daddy in jail.  Poe is very anxious to see her today.  It's his daughter's birthday and Poe's bringing her a birthday present, a bunny....<br /><br />  Don't let that touchy-feely stuff worry you too much.  The movie needs a reason for Poe to be in a hurry to get home, and this one works well enough.  The situation turns ugly before the plane leaves the runway.<br /><br />  CON AIR is an extremely engaging action movie.  The actors are top-notch, including John Cusack as the US Marshal on the ground who believes in Poe and tries to resolve the situation without shooting the hijacked plane out of the air.  The action is non-stop and the dialogue is sometimes startlingly funny.  For instance, at one point one of the bad guys snarls threateningly at Poe \\"You know what I am?\\"  \\"Ugly all day\\" is Poe's deadpan response.  Add to that a lot of explosions and car crashes, snarly bad guys and good guys too, and a pace that's lifted from a Road Runner cartoon and CON AIR is a hoot.  CON AIR is non-stop, totally improbable, over-the-top, and a whole lot of fun.nd car crashes, snarly bad guys and good guys too, and a pace that's lifted from a Road Runner cartoon and CON AIR is a hoot.

B00005JO1R|5.0|I'm not a movie reviewer but I am writing about this movie because I loved it. I loved the movie and I fell in love with Joaquin Phoenix. This movie will make him a huge star and a household name. Everyone everywhere will hear his name. He carries the movie very well along with Reese Witherspoon who already is a star. Joaquin Phoenix does all his own singing which impressed me very much. I went out and bought the CD Soundtrack to Walk the Line. His presence on the screen is captivating. I recommend you watch this movie if you enjoy love stories, country music, any music, and just to watch the riveting performances of Joaquin and Reese. I was so taken by his performance that I went out and read everything I could on Joaquin Phoenix. How could I have missed him in all those other movies? This guy is incredible! Good music and good story make for a very entertaining movie.
B000002KOY|5.0|I'm not not a huge Neil Young fan--well, I do own 5 of his records, but the guy has like 75 in print--and I don't know how I stumbled on this record. But it's excellent. And it's much more musically varied and contemporary sounding than I would expect. You can tell they're Neil's band, but I actually think the rhythms are more interesting than what they do with Neil: and I was suprised at some of the unusual echoes I heard, particularly of early Steely Dan, when they still had a bit of rock and roll in their veins. Finally, it doesn't sound like a 70's relic at all--\\"Dance Dance Dance\\" could easily pass for a Modest Mouse song. It has zero of that smug, stoned-n'-sexist country-rock vibe that can turn off curious younger listeners.  <br /> <br />I must admit I knew little of Danny Whitten, besides being the muse from \\"Tonight's the Night,\\" but now I can understand the quiet way his memory has held on. Judging by this record, at least, he was a special cat.
0316921173|5.0|This is one of my favorite books of all time. I have only read this book twice, but I will undoubtedly read it many more times. I wrote this review simply to tell potential readers why to read, or not read, this book, as this book is not for everyone. My review turned out, unsurprisingly, to be as complicated as the book I'm reviewing, so I divided it into four sections. I hope this helps you decide whether or not to by Infinite Jest.    PART I- WHY YOU MIGHT NOT READ IT  Right away, practical considerations make it difficult for many people to read it. My copy was a gift from an uncle who had tried to read it many times. He would get a few hundred pages in, loving every minute, but he has an extremely time-consuming job and is also raising two kids, and would thus be forced to shelve it for months at a time until he could start it all over again. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that work and family would take priority over a book, no matter how amazing the book is. Don't get this book if you have a busy life. Even if you enjoy it, you will not be able to finish it.    Second, the writing is dense. Make no mistake, this is not the hard-to-parse, poetic language that requires (for me at least) a teacher to manage. The writing is straightforward, but Wallace gives you all the details. This creates a quite effective sense of immersion, but requires a slower pace. Even though it doesn't require any more effort to read, people just parse details and description slower than blow-by-blow action. Even if you have a lot of free time, you may not want to make such a huge commitment- if you put it down for too long, you lose too much of what's going on. If you already have hobbies which consume a lot of your time, or are the type to have several books going at once, you have to rearrange your leisure time around this book. Be warned.    PART II- WHY YOU MIGHT NOT ENJOY IT  Now that we've dealt with practical considerations, let's look at some other issues. As the title ofmy review implies, this book has some issues. If you've read the other reviews, you will notice that these issues are large and frustrating ones. I can't speak for anyone else, but even though I found them frustrating, the perceived flaws didn't affect my enjoyment of the book. Think of your loved ones- their flaws can irritate you, but you don't love them any less. Of course, this is just a book, but that is the best metaphor I could come up with.    Now let's look in depth at the major issues people have had with this book. I say 'issues' and 'perceived flaws' because they are really choices the author made, not bad writing- as you can tell from the other reviews, some things about this book just kill it for readers, but the same things are other readers' favorite parts.    Probably the biggest, most obvious flaw is that is has no ending (or beginning). This seems like something you can't publish a novel without, but Wallace gets away with it, because Infinite Jest is not, in fact, a novel. It's like Wallace just spent years making up anecdotes to tell at dinner parties and then created several interrelated characters to tell all those stories. Wallace is giving us huge chunks of imaginary people's lives, and the book succeeds because you want to hear those types of stories. Just like my fictional dinner party, the book begins and ends only because it can't continue indefinitely. Wallace has written only a part of the whole, because the whole has no beginning or end- in my opinion, this is partly why he called the book Infinite Jest, for that is as good a term as any for what would happen if the book never began or ended.    We now have three reasons you might find this book difficult to enjoy. If you want a conclusion, a sense of closure, resolution, or anything along those lines, you won't find anything like that here. The only things that hold this book together are abstract and symbolic themes (addiction, entertainment, et cetera) and characters themselves. Ifyou tire quickly of hearing other people's stories, you will quickly tire of this book. The acid test in this regard is Seinfeld. Imagine that kind of fascination with minutiae, except on a much larger stage. If you can't understand a TV show if you start watching in the middle, you won't be able to get off the ground. Infinite Jest starts and progresses at the same pace, with almost no background. Everyone, be warned; for the first 200+ pages, you won't really know what's going on. Don't fight it. Just appreciate what's going on at any given moment and you will know the characters with time. To extend the dinner party analogy, you can still enjoy vignettes told by perfect strangers.    PART III- SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT  This book is full of endnotes, 388 to be exact. This means you will need to keep two bookmarks, one for the text and one for the endnotes. These endnotes can also be long. A few take up multiple pages, and some have there own footnotes. When you've gotten absorbed in the text, the endnotes will jerk you out and force you to re-establish your flow state. Let me be clear- that's not a bad thing. Endnotes allow Wallace to add another level of detail, and if I haven't already made this clear, the whole joy of this book lies in its attention to detail. The endnotes should not prevent anyone from reading the book. They are distracting at first, but stick with it and you will appreciate how they enrich the book.    PART IV- WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK  If you've stuck with me through the review so far, then you're probably a little put off by all my warnings. Don't worry. Even if one or two applies to you, you can still enjoy this book, but it will take extra effort before the book starts to pay off. Even if none of these warnings apply to you, it still takes work to prime the pump. However, if you only take one thing away from my mammoth review, let it be this: the rewards of reading this book are huge. I'll describe them, to give you some incentive to make the effort.    I've already mentioned the anecdotal style, but this book is so much more than the literary equivalent of sketch comedy. I've also mentioned Seinfeld, but it's appropriate to mention it again- this book is like an entire season of Seinfeld seamlessly run as one episode. Even though many of these anecdotes could stand on their own, when you read them all, you understand the character's whole world. As fun as the anecdotes are, they are just the tip of the iceberg. Once you start to understand what life is like in drug/alcohol rehab, for example, you want to read more because the place itself is fascinating. The anecdotes show you the psychology of the individual characters, but once you get a feel for the psychology of whole ways of life, you'll be able to read and reread Infinite Jest with no difficulty at all.
B000002NIW|5.0|If you want metal, don't get this.  If you want punk, don't get this. If you want stale old crap that has had little creativity from their influences, don't get this.  This music is for someone who want's to hear something thoughtful, progressive, and new.  Call it nu-metal or what ever, it's just straight up good, inventive hard rock.  These guys are legit. The guitars may not be eddie van halen but it's different and they have a unique sound that I haven't really heard before.  Progress.  That's what music is about.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|this is a great album when john first came on the scene he said that Stevie Ray was one of his biggest influences, thought I liked his first two cds his music was poppy and radio freindly. With this new album he is playing the music that I think that he wanted to play all the time. It rocks and is the kind of music that gives me hope in the direction of music today!!!   <br />Bravo John
B000002UAR|5.0|They won't let me give this one seven stars...<br /><br />From Rubber Soul on, the quality of the Beatles' records is so high that any attempt at meaningful criticism can only be subjective. Revolver may well be their best.  It reflects the freedom and mind expansion that came with a ceasation of touring and exposure to drugs, respectively*.  It is as taut and British and colorful and poppy and as pure a distillation of its time as possible-- and yet it is utterly timeless.<br /><br />The record kicks right in with \\"Taxman,\\" one of Harrison's best rockers, full of bite and satire. \\"Elanor Rigby\\" is one of the band's best-loved melodies; while a tad over-dramatic, the tension created by the string quartet makes this a vital track.  \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" is a classic mid-period Lennon rumination, full of stops and starts and hypnotic effects.  \\"Love You To\\" presages Sgt. Pepper's \\"Within You Without You,\\" an Indian-influenced, sitar raga by Harrison that probably ages worse than anything here (but, interestingly, better than the Sgt. Pepper track.)<br /><br />\\"Here There and Everywhere\\" is one of McCartney's 10 greatest songs, a brilliant melody and enchanting verse.  \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is the obligatory Ringo song, but compared to the rest of what's here it is relatively inconsequential.<br /><br />\\"She Said She Said\\" is crisp, vibrant, driving Lennon rock, one of the record's highlights and an early foray into mild psychedelia (\\"She said, I know what its like to be dead,\\" supposedly based on something a girl kept coming up to him and saying at a party.  Or maybe it was Peter Fonda.)  And from here on in, the needle points to \\"highlight\\" right through to the end.  \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" is a great middle-period McCartney song; more complex and sublime than the earlier \\"Beatleania\\" stuff, not as obtuse as the later psychedelic stuff, and pure joy.  Then Lennon's caustic, intricate \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" and another top-10 McCartney tune, the simple and gorgeous \\"For No One.\\"  Lennon responds with \\"Doctor Robert,\\" and Harrison contributes his second great song on the record, \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" a driving rocker he used as an opener on his 1992 tour.  \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is a great McCartney rocker, accented by horn section; the best part is at the end, where he begins to sing-vamp the song all over again over the outro.  (The Monkees rip this off nicely on \\"I'm a Believer,\\" a true homage.)<br /><br />The record ends with the ominous and weighty \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" Lennon's psychedelic blast that heralds the follow-up singles (\\"Rain,\\" Strawberry Fields\\") and records (Sergent Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour.)  This is the song that goes, \\"Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream.\\"  It is a trippy challenge that the band would answer in spades over the next 4 years.<br /><br />The great thing about Revolver, if you haven't discovered it yet, is that it contains a lot of the Beatles' best songs that were never hits.  So if you know and like the Beatles from the radio but have not explored their records, this one will deliver untold joys, more so than an album where maybe you know most of the songs already.  The joy is in the discovery, and I am sure I am not alone in my envy of any of you getting to discover this for the first time.<br /><br />After this, try: Rubber Soul; Sgt. Pepper; Abbey Road; Help.<br /><br />______________<br />*Note: this is not an endorsement of drug use. But it is impossible to deny the affect marijuana and psychedelics had on popular music in the 60s.\\"Doctor Robert,\\" and Harrison contributes his second great song on the record, \\"I Want to Tell You,\\" a driving rocker he used as an opener on his 1992 tour.  \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\" is a great McCartney rocker, accented by horn section; the best part is at the end, where he begins to sing-vamp the song all over again over the outro.

B000ASSDVA|1.0|This is from the restored print, but this DVD is taken from a Laser Disc source. If you look closely you will see the pre film credits just as they fade out which tells you pretty much from what this has been mastered. I doubt that it is a legal print. While this version is better then nothing it is a long way from doing justice to the beauty of the film. The sound is stereo but not the 5.1 surround that it should be. I'd rate the film a full 5 STARS, but this disc is not much more then a 2 STAR.
B000001FS6|4.0|I am really getting into the spirited tones of U2.  Bono sings with so much passion and the band really alters their style throughout the record.<br /><br />My two favorites on here are God Part II and Love Rescue Me.  The vocals vary nicely between soft and loud on both tracks as you really can feel Bono's emotion as he sings the wrods.  Van Diemans Land is another noteworthy tune that features The Edge on lead vocals.  The cover tunes Helter Skelter and All Along The Watchtower sound fine as does Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For with the gospel arrangement.<br /><br />Truthfully this recording was the turning point for me with U2.  Afterwards the band would record the highly acclaimed Achtung Baby and put some nice experiemntal pieces out on Zooropa and Pop before contributing The stunning recording All That You Can Leave Behind.  Two thumbs up here.
B00005K3NR|4.0|This is a really scary, creepy and well-directed, and acted movie. Normally, most horror movies aren't so good. To find a good horror movie is pretty rare. But to find a horror movie which won big awards like oscar or academy awards, or even get nominated for such, is almost impossible. This movie opposed those odds. It got nominated for 2 Oscars, though it didn't win, it won 2 other awards and another 3 other award nominations(according to the imdb site of this movie).  <br />To me, though, that's not a suprise at all. The movie was extremely well made, and especially well acted. Sissy did a great performance. And so did her crazy ma. And as well as the rest of the cast. Beautiful.  <br />The story is simple: <br />It's about a misfit, outcast, loner, weirdo, shy, paranoid girl, named Carrie, who is always bossed around and picked on and teased and hated on by everyone. The teachers, the principals, her cruel classmates, even her mother for crying out loud. But then again, her mother is an obsessed christian, who can be heard repetetively quoted out psalms and lines from the bible, and can be seen all the time in a black robe and carrying a wooden cross. Anyways, Carrie one day discovers that she has telekeniss powers, that she can move things with her mind. And so she gets revenge on all the people who have done wrong in her life. It's a scary and creepy movie, which really questions your thoughts and actions toward being cruel to anyone else like Carrie. A reccomend watch if you want an entertaining, scary, and \\"sexual\\" movie(though that's only in like one scene, but i tell u it got the milk gushing out of me non-stop!) <br />Amounting at 1 hour and 38 minutes, it's a fast-paced, scary, creepy, suspenseful, bloody, horror/thriller movie, which is based on Stephen King's first novel, and directed by Brian De Palma, the director of Scarface.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The firefly series, in my opinion, is some of the best television i've seen.  Unfortunately it was cancelled just as you begin to really care about the characters.  I see the movie as an attempt to bring all the loose ends to a close.  Another two or three tv series's would have made a better job of this, but that didn't seem to be an option.  There is so much in the way of back story that was crying out to be told.  A movie could never cover all this ground, but it did a pretty good job with the time it had. I'll just have to live with not knowing the preacher's story, or the many other questions not answered. I would not recommend seeing the movie unless you've watched at least the first few episodes of firefly.
B0000CD5FN|5.0|Although I loved-loved The Clash (saw them in '82), I admit that, after an initial brief orientation with Joe Strummer's solo work in the mid '90's, I mistakenly put him aside. Big Mistake. Then, Joe tragically died a few years back.<br /><br />About a year ago I was at a friend's place for a party and I was caught by the music playing, which sounded like Joe's voice but the music was so friggin' hip sounding. Wow!, I said when I was told it was Joe Strummer and The Mescaleros. As much of a music connaisseur as I am, at that point I felt very inadequate.<br /><br />From then on, Streetcore, X-Ray,and Go-Go have been permanent staples in my CD player. The remarkable thing is that they NEVER get played out no matter how many times I hear them. The combination of acoustic and electronic instruments along with punk style vocals and various rhythms and beats is the greatest thing I've ever, ever heard in the last, oh, 20 years.<br /><br />As I get a little older, I welcome mellower sounding music, especially if it has a punk soul and great lyrics. Streetcore and the other Mescalero recordings are the best of both worlds and are also totally versatile. They are good for parties, chilling out, driving, cleaning the house, or just spacing out.<br /><br />I typically give CD's that I like 5 star ratings. Well GLOBAL A GO-GO, ROCK ART AND X-RAY STYLE, and STREETCORE, are all MASTERPIECES in music that deserve their own category of being beyond ratings.<br /><br />RIP Joe. This music will never die.

0060899190|5.0|This compliation of confessed secrets (in postcard form) from a website ranges from fascinating to banal and back again. It's been said that all human beings have a public self, a private self, and a secret self, and being let in on what claims to be the last of the three makes for thought-provoking reading. The editor here did a good job of keeping the themes from being too repetitive, except in those cases where the intention was to show how common certain secrets were. You know, I always thought about tapping into my psyche for a secret to send that site but I never did. Maybe I will for the second book, huh?
B00005RFVL|1.0|What a hateful album this is. Each song, a classic in it's own right, eviscerated by this glorified club singer. The song \\"It was a very good year\\" illustrates my point, you hear Williams's voice, and it's dire, but then to have Sinatra sing on the same song so you can compare the two was folly indeed.  <br /> <br />I would be surprised if this sells even one copy, especially since the originals can be purchased for far less than this. Which fool would therefore choose the talentless imitator over the original? Do yourself a favour and buy the originals if you like these songs, if you buy this people will point at you in the street and laugh.
0553801503|3.0|Honestly, how much do we REALLY care about Cersei, Jaime, and Brienne? Not that much. But most of the book revolves around these characters, with the occasional chapter about some seemingly random side plot. What is worse is that many of the early chapters in the book seem almost entirely unnecessary, or could have been reduced in size considerably. Cersei broods, Jaime does almost nothing, and Brienne travels. GRRM never stretched things out in this way before - he always got to the point, and usually in a way you didn't expect. I understand GRRM's reasons for splitting the story this way, but the missing chapters seem to be the ones that matter the most. This entire book seems like one big side story with a few interesting bits thrown in. I agree with some other reviewers that this book could have used an editor. It just seems like GRRM just wrote like crazy to get another book out and didn't go back to actually decide if what was there actually needed to be there. Anyway, if you are a fan of the series you should probably keep reading. I only hope GRRM doesn't end up falling into the same rhythm Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind fell into.

B000068TSI|5.0|This to me is the best Vietnam movie that has been made. If you want to know what war is like watch this movie. Maybe if everyone knew what war was like it would always be our last option. I think this was Mel Gibsons best performance and showing what the wives went through and also the battle from the enemies side makes this simply the best.
0780020685|5.0|there's no doubt about it - this is THE greatest movie ever!    kurosawa skillfully blends action, philosophy, adventure, romance and drama in this offering.    the story is about a poor village hiring a group of samurai to defend their lives and crops from a gang of bandits. the bandits threatening the village, the hiring of the samurai leader, how he in turn selects and hires the other samurai, the interactions between the samurai and the petty villagers who don't really trust them, the dynamics between the samurai themselves (the young samurai who wants to learn, the samurai who wants to perfect his art, the bitter samurai who is really a peasant, the leader who has to manage all the contradictions and forge them into a disciplined fighting force), the final defense of the village against the bandits - so the story progresses.    the development of the plot, the development of the characters, the fight scenes are all done to perfection.    the movie is in scratchy black and white, with sub-titles and nearly four hours long - but once you start watching it you cannot stop till it is over!
B0002XL35G|1.0|I just saw this movie for the first time and I am sickened by the positive reviews it has gotten. Are we living on alternate planets? This was a HORRIBLE movie. The storyline and the characters were all completely unbelievable. The acting was so bad I sometimes didn't believe they were professional actors on the screen. I muscled through it hoping that something would eventually happen to redeem the movie. Even though I spent no money to watch this I am going to send a bill back to the makers of this movie for compensation for wasting my time and brain cells. I hope I will be able to keep my dinner down tonight. Do yourself a favor if you see it on cable, keep flipping channels. The shopping channel would be more interesting.
0143034901|5.0|This may be the best book you will read all year.  What starts out as young man's nocturnal adventure with his gentle, bookish father becomes the cause of a lifetime and an adult adventure through the perils of post-WWII Barcelona.<br /><br />It hinges on a book by a mysterious writer named Julian Carax entitled \\"Shadow of the Wind\\", and it may be the only remaining book by this author since someone is methodically buying, stealing, and burning every copy in existence.  The owner of this last book is our hero, the boy we meet in the opening chapters whose name is Daniel and who is our guide through the anarchistic underbelly of Barcelona and the privileged gardens of its suburbs as he searches for Carax and flees those who would burn this last book.<br /><br />Daniel is so beautifully, achingly rendered that it is hard to believe this is a translation.  The work in its native Spanish must have been spectacular.  You'll love Daniel, but you will be completely besotted by his mysterious friend and loyal protector, Fermin, a character to end all characters.  Bigger than life, loyal to the extreme, and amazingly literate and well-read, this tattered soul is enchanting and unforgettable.<br /><br />This isn't a book, it is a quest worthy of Cervantes and it is a privilege to be invited for the ride.
B000001E18|5.0|...Vorsprung durch Technik.  I love this album.  Perfect in every way.  I wish U2 would give us more of this and less of the watered down bore-fest they have produced as of late.  I think sound of this album and Acthung Baby have more to do with the influence of Brian Eno than anything... they should work with him again.
B00005JOHI|5.0|I thought I would hate this movie because no one else can be Mr. Darcy like Colin Firth can. But I fell in love with the movie (and the new Mr. Darcy) about one minute into it. It was a wonderful movie! I can't wait for the DVD.
0743243315|4.0|Review Brick Lane <br /> <br />Monica Ali who came to Great Britain at the age of three as the daughter of a English mother and a Bangladeshi father, wrote with Brick Lane in my opinion a wonderful book. <br />Brick Lane, a street in London's East End, is home to many Bangladeshi immigrants since they came as seamen in the 20th century. <br />We accompany Nazneen, the main character, from her birth in Bangladesh over her arranged marriage to the 20 years older Chanu who brings her to London to that point of her life she develops to a woman with an own will.  <br />In the course of the book the issue of Fate plays an important role.  It comes up the first at Nazneen's tragic birth and the question whether Fate should decide will accompany Nazneen during the years.  <br />In contrary to her sister Hasina: she decides to take her life in her own hand and leaves her brutal husband to work in a sewing factory. <br />We get to know her better by reading her letters to Nazneen.  They include also a very vivid and touching description of the country Bangladesh and the role of women there. <br />In general the descriptions in Brick Lane are definitly a plus.  Monica Ali has the skill to describe every little detail in such a fascinating and lively way that you really feel as a part of it.  The descriptions, often interlarded with similes and methapors, function as the spice of Nazneen's rather gloomy atmosphere in Tower Hamlet. <br />Monica Ali succeeded in representing the never ending inner-conflict of immigrants with the western civilisation.  As supporting characters, like Chanu and Mrs. Islam, show, London (in this case) is just a station for succeeding in a job and for making money to send it home or to save it for home-coming. But during that time the moral values and the traditions from back home threaten to get lost.  This omnipresent apprehension becomes clear by focusing on Chanu, on the way he oppresses his children and by looking at Karim who has never been in Bangladesh but fights with all weapons for his religion and its traditions. <br />Focusing on Brick Lane's characters has always been a pleasure because all of them are brilliant represented. <br />With its partly humorous but also very touching and sad sides every page of the book is an adventure and absolutely worth to be read. <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This is unquestionably one of Shakira's greatest albums and defining moments in the music world.  The CD reveals a side of Shakira that hasn't been viewed before, with a mix of typical unusual lyrics and provocative beats.  Her political stance is defined and her emotions are effortless.  On a scale to 1-5, 5 makes it almost discreditable to her achievement.
B000046PVN|5.0|This double-CD edition of Superman is outstanding, a true film music gem if ever there was one. I own 70+ John Williams CDs and still can't decide whether this is his best soundtrack of all time. Without this fantastic music, Superman in my opinion wouldn't have gained half of its success. This music is a work of genius.  <br /> <br />A big round of applause must also go to great talent and wonderful, inspired playing of The London Symphony Orchestra and to rerelease/remaster team. It's really an example of how a great collector's edition of such a great score should look like.  <br /> <br />If you are a serious collector of JW's music (or soundtracks in general), I believe you already possess this. In case you don't, make sure you do. You'll never regret it.
B0000640VO|4.0|This film does what all great films do: it delivers a universal message through an entertaining, well-crafted story and a wonderful attention to detail. On the surface this is a light-hearted, quirky tale about a young woman finding true love, but this is no sappy romantic comedy. In a way, the film is about a woman overcoming the poor training for life that she received from a cold, distant father and a hopelessly neurotic mother. (But don't be put off by this seemingly gloomy topic of dysfunctional parents: the filmmakers use just enough comedy to avoid being grim, yet at the same time do not go to the other extreme of all-out comedy.) A shut-in who is unable connect emotionally with people, a grown Amelie eventually discovers the joy of being a do-gooder, but even this she must do anonymously, from a distance. Only with the (sometimes unintentional) assistance of those whom Amelie has helped (including her beau-to-be) does she finally conquer her shyness and anxieties to find true love. The film also comments on the idiosyncratic or self-centered things that people do to compensate for being unable to love: hypochondria, stalking an ex-lover, obsessing about the lives of strangers, living in the past. But such bold statements and universal themes are made subtly enough not to distract from the story in this brilliant film.--MellowMonk.com <br />
B0001MDP3G|5.0|I avoided this movie when it first came out, thinking that it would only be a pale \\"Gone With the Wind\\" remake. Big mistake.  What a fantastic film this turned out to be (I bought the DVD from Amazon). Each and every minute in this rip-roaring movie is chocked full of ideas, color and great acting.   <br /> <br />The plot:  Won't go into it here, but suffice it to say that it blows \\"Gone With the Wind\\" out of the water.  And the battle scene that happens about ten minutes into the movie is incredible.  If you thought the battle scene in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" was remarkable, this one is even better--or worse, depending on how you look at things. <br /> <br />But what really stands out is the acting.  Renee Zellweger is incredible AND funny. What a versitle actress she is.  The rest of the cast is also great--Jude Law is wonderful and plays against any \\"types\\" he may have played in the past.  The accents are right on and everything rings true in this enormous saga about the Civil War. <br /> <br />There simply aren't enough stars in the heavens for this movie.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|...only joking.    Christopher Nolan's take on the Caped Crusader takes a refreshing and more serious direction than the previous two installments of the Batman franchise. Gone is the irritating self-parody. Gone are the tired theatrics. Gone are the camp villains whom seem more in common with the tone of the original television show (POW! WHACK! YAWN!) rather than Tim Burton's revitalised take on the then stale 'superhero' genre.    Christian Bale is an inspired choice to play Bruce Wayne. If you have seen his portrayal of Patrick Bateman in American Psycho you begin to recognise a true acting talent. His transformation from murderous, souless Wall St yuppie into one of the world's most recognisable superheroes is very similar to Michael Keaton's transformation from his funny OTT performance as the green haired, bug-eating bio-exorcist in Beetlejuice to his sobering, deadpan portyal in Burton's Batman world.    Bale, however, is just as complex as Bruce Wayne as Keaton was in his portrayal. Bale's Bruce Wayne is fuelled by anger, guilt and, initially, a desire for revenge. In this respect, he is not much different from Henri Ducard, Bruce Wayne's initial mentor (played by Liam Neeson) - who teaches Wayne how to let go of his fears.    Katie Holmes is the love interest as Rachel Dawes, a district DA (if somewhat unrealistically young) who, like Wayne, seeks justice in a city slipping into squalor and corruption, fuelled by apathy.    Michael Caine is great as Alfred. He is very paternal to Wayne, even to the point of chastising him as if he is a mischievous school boy. Morgan Freeman adds warmth as a fallen Lucius Fox who keeps some pretty cool toys in his warehouse-like workplace.     Gotham City has also been given a fresh takeover. Gone is the neo-gothic fairyland that is always nearly buried in night and snow. This city is a fusion of New York and Chicago and other huge city landscapes. This supplements the film's more sober approach to the Batman legacy. Criminals are drug-dealers, mobsters, corrupt cops, rather than Jokers, Riddlers, etc. The Scarecrow is a wacky villain, but his use of mind destroying drugs is creepy and sinister enough to give him serious gravitus.    I found this film brilliant in its fresh retake on the story. This, arguably, is the best superhero film to be made in years. It has revitalised the legacy for new Batman fans as well as offering something new for old die-hards.    The ending finishes up with a tantalising prospect of a sequel (I read somewhere Jude Law may play the Joker, though it may be just a rumour).
B000BM6AVA|4.0|This album is about the same thoughts i had on Mezmerize, fun to listen to, but gets kinda annoying after awile. This has a few memorable songs, my favorite is Soldier Side. Dont get me wrong, this is a good effort from System, but nothing compared to thier first two albums. I have been a fan for about four years, I liked it alot better when Daron only played guitars, and thier music was harder. Saying that though, change isn't necessarily always a bad thing.
0385510454|2.0|Reading this book was torture for me because I found it so, well, boring. Don't get me wrong - I like Grisham, have ever since his very first, which I think is his very best. Also enjoyed most of the others, although I'd like to see him get back to the style he used in A Time to Kill or even The Firm or The Pelican Brief. This one is mediocre at best, left me feeling that Grisham was only half-heartedly writing the thing. Maybe now the money is more appealing than the love of writing. Come on, Mr. G., you can do better than this.  <br /> <br />Will I read his next one? You betcha.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|My Husband and I accidentally stumbled upon this series, and we have never looked back! It is a very unique series that involves sci fi space travel AND old western gun/fist fights! This very well written series from Joss Whedon, leaves you in nail biting, edge of your seat suspense! Not to mention the good old fashioned chivalry and honest theft (^_- you flans know what I'm talking about!) that put the icing on the cake. I highly recomend this series to anyone who likes to fall in love with characters and wants to feel like they are right there for the ride!

B0000A98ZP|5.0|This movie is a true classic.  It is perfect for any teenager, or anyone who simply remebers being a teenager.  I would reccomend it for anyone who was a teenager in the 80's, but no one older than that.  My grandmother cannnot stand this movie.  The Breakfast Club also has great music, you should totally check out the soundtrack.  Basically, if you are a teenager and you haven't seen this movie yet, you have to see it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a big reviewer but I have to chime in when I find a show that is incredible. I am a HUGE Stargate fan and I have to say this had better writing and better acting. To say it was cut off in its prime is an understatement. This show was unbelievable. Bring it back!!!!
B0000214F0|5.0|This incredible movie reminded me of a bad car accident I saw as a child, -horrific, shocking, fascinating. It is perverse, erotic and so incredibly haunting, that the images will stay with you long after the credits have rolled. I have a feeling that it was probably a hell of a lot worse in real life than was actually dipicted by this movie and in my opinion, it is a brilliant historical piece.     The performances of Helen Mirren, Malcom McDowell, Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud were marvellous and inspired, -they all deserved Oscar nominations in my opinion!  Unforgettable.
B000AP04OM|5.0|This lovely new 40th Anniversary 2-disc edition of THE SOUND OF MUSIC is a real treat.  But, for those in a quandry about buying yet another DVD release of the film (following the \\"Five Star\\" 2-disc edition), I say, buy this version but keep the old one too, because it has some great extras that were not ported onto this new edition (more about that later).<br /><br />THE SOUND OF MUSIC is of course based on the long-running 1959 hit Broadway musical that originally starred Mary Martin.  The musical was inspired by a Geman film called \\"Die Trapp Famile\\", based on the book by Maria Augusta Trapp.  The story is as well-known as those hills that truly did come alive with the sound of music:  Maria (Julie Andrews) is a postulant nun at the Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg circa 1938.  The Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood) becomes well-aware that the spirited Maria is hardly suited to the cloistered life of a nun.  So Maria is assigned as governess to the seven children of an autocratic widower, Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer).  Like a breath of fresh mountain air, Maria transforms the children and eventually steals the Captain's heart away from a worldly Baroness (Eleanor Parker).  But the Nazi Anschluss is coming, and the family's safety is under threat...<br /><br />This new DVD contains a wealth of new bonus material including :<br />\\"Audio Commentary\\" - brand new commentary track with Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, choreographer Dee Dee Wood and Charmian Carr amongst others.  The Robert Wise director commentary (from the \\"5 Star\\" release) is also included.<br /><br />\\"A Few of My Favourite Things\\" - Julie Andrews hosts this generous-length documentary which features new interviews with key cast and production team members, some rare photos, footage from behind the scenes and more.<br /><br />\\"Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer: A Reminiscence\\" - Julie and Chris sit down and share their memories from the film.<br /><br />\\"From Liesl to Gretl: A 40th Anniversary Reunion\\" - This is something truly special.  This segment reunites all seven von Trapp children to share their own memories and talk about the film.  With Charmian Carr (Liesl), Nicholas Hammond (Friedrich), Heather Menzies (Louisa), Duane Chase (Kurt), Angela Cartwright (Brigitta), Debbie Turner (Marta) and Kym Karath (Gretl).<br /><br />\\"On Location with The Sound of Music\\" - Charmian Carr takes us on a personally-guided tour of Salzburg, taking in the historical sites as well as the locations featured in the film.  This is a cute update on \\"Salzburg Sights and Sounds\\", which Carr made as a featurette during production of SOM in 1965 (and which can be found on the \\"5 Star\\" release).<br /><br />\\"When You Know the Notes to Sing: A Sing-Along Phenomenon\\" - This takes a look behind the scenes during the 40th Anniversary \\"Sing-Along a-Sound of Music\\" screening held at the Hollywood Bowl with an audience of over 18,00 people.  The \\"Sing Along\\" version of the film has taken off all over the world, and this featurette gives you a definite flavour of one.<br /><br />\\"The von Trapp Family: Harmony and Discord\\" - This is the fantastic `Biography' episode which takes an in-depth look at the real von Trapp clan.  We learn that the real Maria was a far more flawed and fallible human being than we ever saw in \\"Sound of Music\\", and also the shocking fact that infamous Himmler took over the von Trapp villa shortly after their exit from Salzburg.  Featuring interviews with several of the real von Trapp children.<br /><br />\\"Mia Farrow screen test\\" - A fascinating look at the girl who might have played Liesl if Charmian Carr was never cast in the role.  Farrow sings a brief section of \\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen\\" in a blonde wig.  Lesley Ann Warren also auditioned for the role (she appeared in the title role of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \\"Cinderella\\" instead), but it might have been nice to have had Lesley's screen test also.  Oh well...<br /><br />\\"Restoration comparison\\" - Compares a 1993 print of the film with the new 40th Anniversary restored print.<br /><br />There are also copious trailers and galleries to watch and explore.<br /><br />The \\"Five Star\\" double disc set also included the fabulous doco \\"From Fact to Phenomenon\\", and that is the main reason why I'll keep my old DVD alongside this new version.  I recommend that all fans purchase this new edition, if only for the reunion featurette.  For those who have yet to buy SOM in digital format, this release is a no-brainer.are also copious trailers and galleries to watch and explore.

B00000IJPU|4.0|Just like the other reviewers here I am stumped as to how they left out key tracks like \\"Flight of the Icarus\\" but I guess to put out just a 1-disc version of Iron Maiden's best stuff someone had to make a call what to leave out even though we may not agree.<br /><br />What is clear is that this disc is not meant for the die-hard fan; for that they released the 2-disc version for you and they expected you to have all the albums anyway.  This disc is clearly aimed at those who had never heard the band before and don't want to go broke having to get all the albums let alone a 2-disc compilation.  The record company were looking at converting/recruiting new fans.  I know because I was one of them.<br /><br />As a guitarist who started out learning the licks of many greats like Joe Satriani, I was intrigued when I read in one of Joe's instruction books about the importance of Iron Maiden's guitarists to the development of speed metal and to even what HE plays!  Joe knows best, I thought, and so I dutifully went and got this album.  I had heard \\"Flight of the Icarus\\" before and I thought it was great but it wasn't enough to make me want to go get all their albums and so I for one was pleased to find this disc in the store.<br /><br />I was simply blown away at the complexity of the musical ideas (this is heavy metal for goodness sakes, I thought), the great speed and dexterity of the guitarists and indeed the whole rhythm section.  Bruce's voice quality goes without saying and really, 16 tracks on a 77 min 53 secs long disc that is remastered albeit not so well is a great bargain!  The cd liner notes are fantastic as well as they are full colour and have photos and all the lyrics!  The disc itself is a picture disc with great colour depictions of Eddie!<br /><br />For those of you who like me were/are not diehard fans but want to get a not-so-short sampler of the band or if you are an aspiring speed metal guitarist, this is essential listening.  Now, for me, I'll start looking for a well-packaged and remastered version of the \\"Piece of Mind\\" album so that I can get my beloved \\"Flight of the Icarus!\\", I'll start looking for a well-packaged and remastered version of the \\"Piece of Mind\\" album so that I can get my beloved \\"Flight of the Icarus!\\"
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Loved this movie. I loved it cynisism and down right nasty look at love and relationships. Perhaps this is because I am a bitter [nasty] but everything in it rang true to me. It is the story of 4 people who meet become involved and then tear it all up and cheat and then go thru all the mechinations of covering up, breaking up, being supposedly happy till they find something or someone else and then go thru the whole cycle again. I am not a big Julia Roberts fan but she was good in this. Clive Owen was just excellent as the brutish but likable macho guy. The internet chat/cyber sex scene was hilarious as was the Roberts/Owen break up that just was biting and hardcore down in the dirt dialogue. The whole movie is full of great hardass dialogue that I just thought was hilarious.<br /><br />Also, Natalie Portman as a stripper and in a thong.
B000059QYB|5.0|If you are looking for the best compilation of Billy Idol that's out there look no further cuz this is it!  What the product description doesn't tell you is that this disc is also 24-bit digitally remastered and so the sound quality is excellent.  Also, you get 16 tracks with a healthy mixture of studio, live, unplugged live, original and covers that fill up the disc and so it's great value for money.<br /><br />Although \\"Rebel Yell\\" is a rip-off of \\"White Wedding\\" but I guess if you're going to rip-off the entire rhythm section of your own song then it's okay and together with my favourite \\"Eyes Without a Face\\" are the best tracks here.  Speaking as a guitarist, I cannot tell you enough how much fun it is to play the rhythm guitar solo to this track and the chords to the song are very interesting and almost jazz-like in the way they sound.<br /><br />I also have to tell you about the MVP of Billy Idol's sound, the brilliant Steve Stevens.  When I first heard the intro to \\"Rebel Yell\\" I thought that it had to either be 2 guitarists or Steve overdubbing himself and then I read an article he wrote in a guitar magazine and lo and behold it was all him playing at the same time!  I tried copying the technique he described in the magazine and I saw straight away that it was going to take lots of practice to even come close to what he did on the track.  Amazing guitarist!<br /><br />However, even the greats can have a bad day, witness the unplugged version of \\"Rebel Yell.\\"  I always smile when I hear that track because I can empathise with Steve.  As all guitarists who have ever had to play live can tell you, you just sometimes run out of ideas.  It's quite funny the way Steve loses it at about the 3/4 mark of his solo (I bet he was praying that it wouldn't last that long) and stops playing.<br /><br />You can almost hear his brain cranking frantically thinking of what to play next and even Billy Idol himself had to coax Steve when he exclaims \\"Common Steve!\\" after which Steve tries valiantly but the solo continues meekly and ends in a whimper!  Poor Steve!  Just hear that track and you'll know what I mean; every performing guitarist's nightmare.  But hey, after what he did with all the other tracks, we'll forgive him for his bad day at the office.<br /><br />Overall a great album to get and with remastered sound and 16 great track selections, this is highly recommended and essential listening for any rock guitarist wannabe.after which Steve tries valiantly but the solo continues meekly and ends in a whimper!

Do you enjoy telling people detailed stories about the dead and mutilated victims?  If not, congratulations on having a soul, but I'm afraid you will not like this appalling movie, which is one long bloody spectacle of carnage without meaning.  If you do you will enjoy this movie, but you are a twisted, loveless freak.  Try therapy.

0345475674|5.0|I have a slight bias in reviewing this novel because of my hydraulic engineering background.  The hero is a young Roman engineer, Marcus Attilius Primus, who has just been appointed aquarius in charge of the Aqua Agusta, the aquaduct serving the population around the Bay of Neapolis (the Bay of Naples).<br /><br />The novel is set during the height of imperial Rome, and the action takes place over a period of a few days, just before and during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius.  Attilius has taken a working party out to repair a break in the aquaduct, the main fresh water supply for about 200,000 people.  In the process he has stumbled into a nest of corruption involving the use of water and the evasion of water bills.  Attilius has the flaw of being honest, and is considered a danger to people profiting from bribes.<br /><br />Events are compounded by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (the last days of Pompeii).  The hero, Attilius, must rescue a young woman (of course) and fight various evil people in the process (of course).<br /><br />The novel is well researched and well written, and presents information for a general audience on both the Roman aquaduct system, and the eruption of a volcano.  It is also a good adventure novel and would make a great motion picture.<br /><br />The novel does give a few insights into imperial decadence and the Roman class system.  A slave is fed to eels, young girls (and some young boys) are held enslaved in prostitution, daughters are bartered away like commodities, corrupt politicians trade favors for votes, etc.
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|One of the interesting aspects of the original X-Men were that they were also students at Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters, where the teenagers were learning to become superheroes.  When the X-Men grew up and went international they got away from the whole school idea become irrelevant even with the arrival of Kitty Pryde.  But then Marvel came up with \\"The New Mutants,\\" which got back to the idea of teenagers learning to deal with their powers and with being teenagers.  The school aspect has been played up more in the \\"X-Men\\" movies, but it is still a secondary consideration to what the grownups are doing, which is why \\"Sky High\\" has its inherent appeal.<br /><br />Granted, the superhero world of \\"Sky High\\" is more akin to that found on Saturday morning cartoons than Marvel comic books, but that is because the idea is to keep thing fun while trying to slip in the lesson.  Our young hero here is Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), the off spring of the most famous superheroes in the world, the Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston).  The Commander is certainly a little bit full of himself, but without in danger of becoming obnoxious and while being over the top is central to the performances in these films Russell and the other adults only go about as far as their eyes in doing so.  That way the kids get to keep things real.<br /><br />The key scene in the film for me is when Layla (Danielle Panabaker, who they should get to play a young Bree in any \\"Desperate Housewives\\" flashbacks), the girl next door who is Will's best friend but wants to be more, has a talk with Will's arch enemy, Warren Peace (Steven Strait) at a Chinese restaurant about the upcoming Homecoming Dance.  This is a scene we have seen before being played by kids with superpowers (she controls flora, he plays with fire), but it is played with a refreshing honesty and makes it clear these are real kids and not just cartoon superheroes.<br /><br />Will and Layla are now freshmen at Sky High, the alma mater of his parents.  Because Will's parents are the Commander and Jetstream he is considered to be a BMOC but there is one problem: his powers have not come in yet.  That means when the incoming class is separated into heroes and sidekicks by Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), Will ends up being one of the latter.  So does Layla, but that is because she refuses to use her powers to buy into the existing power structure.  This is not good, because he is supposed to be a third-generation superhero and telling his dad he is just a sidekick is a fate worse than death.<br /><br />The division into heroes and sidekicks means that Sky High ends up being just like any other high school with its cliques as the future heroes treat their future sidekicks like something less than support staff (sidekicks do not get names or costumes until they are assigned such by their heroes at graduation).  Will makes friends with the other sidekicks, all of whom have superpowers, just unimpressive ones (e.g., glowing, turning into a guinea pig).  But just as the lines are drawn between \\"us\\" and \\"them,\\" Will's powers kick in and he switches sides.  Suddenly he is hanging with the heroes and he has caught the attention of sexy senior Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).  Meanwhile, Royal Pain, one of the Commander's old super villains, has set his eyes on the kids at Sky High.<br /><br />Now, you should know exactly how this is going to play out, but that does not stop you from enjoying the proceedings.  All of those minor superpowers enjoyed by Will's sidekick friends are going to be the powers needed at the right time and the right place.  The screenplay was written by Paul Hernandez, Robert Schooley & Mark McCorkle, and whoever wrote the last line of the film go the final punch line right.  The result is not great satire but certainly a lot of fun, including waiting around for Lynda Carter's Principal Powers to make the inevitable in-joke.  This is really a cute movie, which is certainly not a bad thing in this case.y a cute movie, which is certainly not a bad thing in this case.

In the millions of pages already written on the subject, there are no books that I know of that do in essence, a character study on Lincoln and his cabinet members.  The 754 page text is one of the best ever written regarding the true and underlying nature of those men who served with Lincoln in his cabinet. <br /> <br />While events and persons such as Antietam, Jefferson Davis, Fort Sumter, Maryland's secession attempt and many other events receive short shrift from Ms. Goodwin, this treatment is as it should be for her book concentrates on the personality and character of Lincoln and his cabinet. <br /> <br />While Lincoln never committed himself during the convention to any of his rivals in terms of cabinet positions, to gain votes for his eventual nomination; he voluntarily chose most of his cabinet from men who were his greatest rivals for the Presidency.  He did this with clear and present knowledge that they were the best men for the jobs and the country at the time.  The incredibly impressive exposition of the character of these men and especially that of Abraham Lincoln and his political and personal acumen in holding them together is given new life in this book. <br /> <br />Through careful reading and perusal of literally thousands of personal letters from cabinet members and from President Lincoln, Goodwin is able to put together a wonderfully clear and unique picture of the character of these men.  In addition, she is able to paint a picture of each in words, and point out how their true character differed often from the public perception that abounded. <br /> <br />Ms. Goodwin should be noted for her fine and excruciating work in creating this book which will remain as a must read classic for Lincoln scholars of the present and the future.  All of us who track the Lincoln Presidency, 140 years after its termination are grateful for her assiduous work in creating thiswonderful book.  <br />
068987474X|2.0|I only had a quick look through this book so maybe I shouldn't be reviewing it, but it bugged me so much I am.   <br /> <br />I admit it had some good points.  If a guy is ignoring you, married, lying scum or just plain obnoxious, you should probably get rid of him.  He's probably Not That Into You.  But you knew that without reading this book.  You are not stupid. <br /> <br />It occurred to me at one point the book should be renamed \\"101 Reasons to Freak Out and Dump Him\\".   This book is not a boost to a woman's confidence.  If you believe this book, it would seem no man you've ever been with, probably not even the man who married you, ever really loved you.  The problem is people are not perfect.  Their motivations are not simple.  I think that's my main complaint about this book: it's too simplistic!  No two relationships, or persons, are exactly the same.  And, in general, men do like women!  Some relationships work out, some don't.  There's always that space in-between where it could go one way or the other.  That's okay, because that's the way life is. <br />
B00005JO1J|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have never seen the play, but was encouraged to see it by a dear friend who had seen the play twice.  I only knew the basics of the story and that it was SAD.  As I HATE sad movies (like Love Story) I ws a tad dubious about going, but must admit to the trailer REALLY looking good, and OMG that song, Seasons Of Love hooked me from the start. So while I was afraid I would be depressed the rest of the day we all went opening weekend.  I was TOTALLY blown away!!  This movie is NOT dark or tragic!!  It celebrates LIFE!!  Yes, admittedly you will laugh, you will cry, and there are sad things in it....but then aren't there in LIFE too??  You leave this movie feeling uplifted and filled with hope...the message being to treasure EVERY mintue you have with the people you love...life is fleeting and precious!!!  I thought the entire cast was stellar!!  AND was most impressed by the fact that all but two of the original broadway cast reprised their roles for this....and were FANTASTIC!!!  And who says you don't get better with age??  Bah to the hum buggers who think AGE holds you back or slows you down!!  The director, the cast, the music was perfect to me....I was TOTALLY impressed and pleased with this film and can't wait to own it on DVD!
B00068IOWC|2.0|This is a decent album by general standards, but U2's least evocative work.  This album is plain and forgettable compared to their other excellent work.  There are several strong tracks, but the lyrical content overall is weak, and the musical content is nothing new from average pop rock.  How has the studio sapped the emotion of such a great live band?  If you are new to U2, check out Joshua Tree or Achtung Baby instead.
B000002G87|3.0|Sure,most of Mr. Clapton's stuff is reasonably good, but really that's only when it's compared to the immediate competition. Truly, when one is a rather naive 17 year old, some of these tunes may not sound half bad! But with some musical and worldly experience, this album, like just about all \\"Rock\\", fades away into the realm of adolescent sentimentality,bordering on noisy nonsense. Indeed, listening to say \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" for a wizened old timer (now over 50) is simply an embarrassment, and the idea of these performers playing them now is even worse. Same with just about everything here. And the copy cat version of \\"Little Wing\\", originally written/recorded by Eric's old rival, J. Hendrix, does not come close to the original! Really, the best Clapton can still be heard on the older (1967-68)\\"Cream\\" albums, much of which still sounds fresh and unique, not just thumping re-treads of 3 chord blues with banal lyrics.

B000BJS4SU|1.0|Hey George Costanza! You dont know *#$ about blues rock. If you think Kenny Wayne and Johnny Lang are anywhere near the top of the list of great young blues rock guitar players, you must be smoking crack. Neither of the two can even hold a candle to the likes of REAL blues rock players like Doyle Bramhall II or Mato of Indigenous. Heck even Henry Garza of Lonely Boys blows KWS Johnny Lang and John Mayer out of the water ...and hes is nowhere near as good as Bramhall II or Mato. Do yourself a favor and listen to the real deal before you go talking about things you obviously know nothing about.
B0007XT87G|3.0|Other reviewers compare this album to its predecessor \\"In Absentia\\". Well, there's another way it's like that earlier release and it's in the fact that you MUST have a conventional audio CD player to listen to it. You cannot play this album using your computer's media player software--it will not even load. Actually, it crashed my machine. I was figuring I might have to ship this album back but I slapped it in my Discman, where it played just fine. So there probably isn't a flaw in the disc that wasn't put there deliberately. Obviously P-T's record label has some rather hard-line policies on how to prevent piracy. If I didn't have that Discman and the player in the car, this album would be a coaster for my purposes, because my comp would be useless for the task. So I'm not going to bother to repeat what others have written here about the music itself, some of whom did it better than I could. They're absolutely right--this is some great music here. That's why this album gets 3 stars--it's an average between 5 stars for the awesome music that P-T still haven't lost their touch in playing for us, and zero stars for the the somewhat anti-consumer packaging we get it in. Given the consistently high-quality music we get from P-T, I would guess they have a higher regard for us as their fans than their record company has for us as customers who I guess are most of us common thieves.
B000002C4J|5.0|my husband and i totally love this cd. celine speaks to us in a way that others can't. sometimes it actually feels like she talks to me when i'm alone. OH MY GAWD!!! we listen to this whole album at least twice a day. i'm not kidding!!! it's SOOOO cute, my husband (who is sooooo totally not gay) cries whenever he hears my heart will go on. he cries and holds my hand and whispers \\"i love you soooo much\\" it's too CUTE!!!! i just want everyone to know that she is getting better and prettier with age and her las vegas show (i've seen it 12 times and counting) is so inspirational. her and her husband are the couple that we would most like to mirror (we even said so in our wedding vows and even made a play about them). anyway, this album made me want to write as exceptionally as she does so i wrote a poem that i think of everytime i hear her angelic voice. <br /> <br />\\"god made me to love you so, my sweet sweet baby, oh you fill me up, with your joy and christian servitude, i love you more and more as each day comes to a close, i need you more than ever, glen, oh glen, i love you so\\" hopefully, you'll see that on the next amazng album by a truly amazing artist.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Now that everyone is talking about \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\", I want to go back over a year and talk about about thier stunning self titled debut. W.O.W.! I can not tell you how much I love this one. This album is definitely a keeper, a classic in every sense of the word. I would love give each band member a big kiss on the cheek (esecially Bob :) and thank them for making such an absolutely FUN and entertaining album! There's no filler here. It's fast paced, no dragging allowed, punk/pop/dance/rock bliss! Did I mention this album is extremely sexxxxxxy? Yes, sir! \\"Tell Her Tonight, Auf Acshe, Cheating on You, Darts of Pleasure\\", and the very hot \\"Michael\\" are all proof that these guys have quite the tounge for sexy.  <br />So stomp that foot and make way for Franz Ferdinand!   <br />

B0000AQS0F|5.0|We heard so much about this series from online sources, we decided to give it a try. And, boy!, were we hooked from the first minute. The characters are varied but not cliched,  excellent script, very, very funny, well done special effects, cool space ship, original... I can't say enough good things about this series. Well done to Joss Whedon and his amazing cast and crew! I'm recommending it to my 70 year old mother who is an avid Star Trek/anything sci-fi and Western fan. She's going to be giddy. There's no *bad* language as they don't swear in english or present day terms. It can be violent but not too much so, and there's very little sex. We looked forward to each episode with glee and rubbed hands as each started. It's so nice to see something that is as near to perfect (for us) as we've seen in a very long time. Let's all hope that the TV powers-that-be see sense and buy another 10 series. Looking forward to the movie....
B0000648WZ|1.0|This movie shares one thing in common with Robert Heinlein's Classic and that is the name.  The book follows the career of a soldier in the future and examines the true nature of what it means to be a soldier.  The description of a soldier's thoughts, feelings, actions, and motivations are as true now as they were in Heilein's time and as they will be in the future. This book was placed on the secretary of the army's suggested reading list for junior officers not because it is an exciting science fiction novel (although it is) but because of how accurately it portray's the life of a young military leader.  The movie is fun and worth watching but the screenplay writers completely missed the point.  Do yourself a favor and read the book.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|i too was blessed with the opportunity to attend this once in a lifetime event. although i was not there for all three days ( i flew in from Tampa for the Sunday big show) this was by far the finest guitar preformance i have ever witnessed in person. and as a 50 yo kid i have seen quite a few shows. i recomend this to all fans of the guitar as an instrument of communication. plus....being actually in the video was special, lol.i ended up front row dead center in between the two stages set in one end of the Cotton Bowl. This video accurately captires the spirit of the event. This was not a show for a fan of one musical genre, but a fan of the guitar in its entirety. as Clapton says in one interview \\"I wrote to everyone i wanted to hear play....and they all showed up\\". buy this dvd and you will not be dissatisfied......
B000BOH8XW|3.0|As a diehard Shakira fan, I have heard all of her prior work. This album is of solid quality, perhaps more consistently good than her prior work. I highly recommend it.    The first two tracks are spectacular. They have the lush musicality of U2 ballads. In them, Shakira has the energy and emotion of Alanis Morisette, only better! When I heard them first, I thought to myself, geez, this is going to be one of the best pop albums I ever owned!    However, the rest of the album falls below the standard set by the opening tracks. There are solid, good ballads. I'd say that they are too \\"average\\" for Shakira, sort of what you'd expect on one of her good albums, but not four or five star stuff. In fact, the Santana collaboration is uncharacteristically laid back and lazy -- I would qualify it as weak, given Shakira's usual lyrical depth and energy.    Many like the last track Timor. It is good, but musically falls short. It has a direct, politically charged, early-U2 style of message, which is unusual for Shakira. However, musically it sounds like the Russian Tatu lollipop dance-pop. I think the style does not fit the substance in that song. The cheesy cheerful music juxtaposed with the serious message is probably part of the artistic intent, however.    I believe that the album will grow on me (and you); I am still getting adjusted to the new style I am hearing. In terms of lyrics and musical complexity it is clearly better than her previous English language album, Laundry Service. Some of the lyrics are more mature, more thought provoking. While Laundry Service had translations of Spanish songs and some catchy lyrics here and there overcompensated by lively music, here it is clear that the songs were written to convey a message in English. She expresses herself with a newfound colloquial ease, natively in English, which kind of reminded me of Alanis. As far as the sound, it still has some of her old signature, but it may as well be a British or American band you are hearing. There is more of a global pop sound here, you can't point to her Latin roots quite as much as in her earlier work. There are even some French lyrics and Brit-band guitar riffs in here :) The sound engineers deserve kudos too: play this CD through good headphones or stereo, and you'll hear wonderful subtle details; it is very well recorded.    Overall, there are surprises in store for the Shakira fan. What is most impressive to me is how Shakira keeps turning out such good albums which show growth, development, and yet keep her signature style. She consistently succeeds, king of like U2, and I hope her career is similarly long and productive as theirs. You may disagree with the analogy, but you know what I mean :) She just has the deep store of genuine talent that keeps her going -- she is not a manufactured and over-marketed pop star, and it shows on this album.    Bottom line:   I recommend this album and CD as it is high quality throughout. If you are a Shakira fan, it's a no-brainer must-have. Three stars was too harsh, come to think of it - I hurried this review and can't give four stars now :)

B000AP04FG|4.0|\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is a movie that is fairly predictable and often laughably implausible. But it's also one of those movies that, while you're watching it, you're having such a good time you just don't care.<br /><br />Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as John and Jane Smith, have this great on-screen chemistry that's just irresistable. Even when they're beating the tar out of one another (and yes, they both get in some good licks), you get the feeling that they're enjoying every minute.<br /><br />As for the action, there's a lot of it, and it's great fun. From a car chase down a freeway involving three matching bulletproof BMW sedans chasing down a minivan, to some pretty serious indoor gunfights, including a final showdown with John and Jane Smith against just a small army of agents in a sporting goods store, it all flows together into a high-octane flow of visceral fun.<br /><br />The movie is quite funny as well, not only in the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but with some extra amusement supplied by Vince Vaughn, who plays up his role as John's irreverent friend and business partner. I was laughing almost all the way through, as I think was intended.<br /><br />My only real complaint (a minor one) was that I wished that the trailers for the movie had not given away so much of the premise. There's a full 30 minutes or so that is spent exploring the surface-level relationship of John and Jane Smith, in which you get only gradual hints to their \\"other lives.\\" It would have been even more fun to have discovered this along the way, rather than going into the knowledge from the trailers of what the rest of the movie is about. But, that's more of a quibble with how the movie was marketed, not so much how it was made.<br /><br />In itself, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is exciting and fun. It's not a thinking-person's movie by any means, but just a movie to enjoy for what it is. In a weird way, it's a great date movie, too...but only if you and your date are in the mood for a high-octane action story.in the mood for a high-octane action story.
B00005LMBK|4.0|After falling in love with Demon Days this past spring, I was pretty much required to give this album a chance as well. And, while not as satisfying a listen as Demon Days, I was still glad I did.<br /><br />This album is certainly spread across a larger variety of sounds than its successor. It opens with an indie vibe and moves through a series of reggae, hip-hop, punk, rock, electronica, and stoner derivatives. This, like always, is a strength and a weakness at the same time. Lots of variety means it doesn't risk getting boring, but it also means you have to be in a more tolerant mood to listen to the whole thing in one sitting.<br /><br />I would have to say that this album's best moments are the tired,  half-stoned melodic tunes such as \\"Tomorrow Comes Today,\\" \\"New Genius,\\" \\"Sound Check,\\" \\"Double Bass,\\" \\"Starshine,\\" and \\"Slow Country.\\" \\"5/4\\" has a mischevious swagger that stands out as well, and of course the funky \\"Clint Eastwood\\" deserves a mention.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Del's drunk Rainman rapping style which compliments \\"Clint Eastwood\\" so well stumbles gracelessly all over \\"Rock tha House.\\" Even though the trumpet and flute melodies are pretty cool, I just have a hard time wading through the awkward rapping and PG-rated party lyrics. If there's a single song I skip on this album, it's this one.<br /><br />Even with that low point, this is still worth buying in my opinion. Easygoing pop and hip-hop tunes with enough musical maturity and sentimental value to greatly lengthen its shelf life - but not so self-important as to turn off the casual listener. And it only got better after this...
B00062J00S|4.0|I thought this was ok good movie. I saw this with my dad and I didn't hate it at all. I just really think it went back and forth. The angel really should of came earlier in the movie. They should of shown George's life not as long. Besides that, it was good.
B00005JO1J|5.0|All I knew about RENT came from having watched Hedwig and the Angry Inch. That was it. I walked into the theatre having no real concept of what I was getting myself into. <br /> <br />What I found was music, love, friendship, sadness, and a final feeling of hope. My two favorite songs were Seasons of Love and Will I Lose My Dignity / No Day But Today / Finale, because to me they completely encompassed the meaning of the show/movie. It's about living each day like it's your last, but being wary all the way, yet having the hope to continue *living*. Period. And for that, I adored it. <br /> <br />I don't know about the play production, but I can't see any flaws in the movie. Washy characters? Heck no. Bad music? Impossible. Non-mainstream topics? Okay, but that only adds to the atmosphere! I understood the lyrics, plot, setting, character interactions, and the emotions. It was a *wonderful* movie, and I highly reccommend it to *anyone*.
B000002C1W|5.0|\\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\", Pink Floyd's 13th album, is the first of the two INCREDIBLE post-Waters Floyd albums, and packs a PUNCH!! There are three kinds of PF fans out there- those who prefer Waters, those who prefer Gilmour, and those who think BOTH are equally talented. I fall into the 3rd category. I totally treasure the Waters-Floyd, but I also hold Gilmour-Floyd in HIGH regard, and I feel that David Gilmour is just as talented as Roger Waters in most respects. Gilmour may occasionally need a little help in the lyrics department, but his direction and style is NOTHING short of SPECTACULAR!! This incredible album contains some of the most potent PF material to date, and is music you may want to experience while visiting the ocean. Very deep, very satisfying. The album cover alone says it all- an ocean beach. Some say it doesn't \\"sound\\" like PF, but I heavily disagree. It just has a bit more 80's sound to it than their previous albums, but not by much. Ofcourse, keep in mind this is coming from a man who loves 80's music, so it you prefer the 70's sound, this may not be for you. But even after having said that, I still think this album TOTALLY sounds like Pink Floyd in most respects. I kind of think of it as the \\"Dark Side\\" for the 80's. It is a VERY powerful, entrancing  album that always leaves me hungry for more. David Gilmour proves that he, too, has incredible talent with this album, and should NEVER be put below Roger Waters. They are BOTH fantastic musicians- I'll just leave it at that. It is unfortunate that this wonderful piece of work gets such a bad rap from a lot of PF fans, because I personally think it's GREAT and should be in any PF collection. Not as much of a \\"concept\\" album as some of their other work, but EVERY bit as EXCITING. A bit more up-beat sounding than \\"The Final Cut\\", and just as satisfying. Very much worth a listen at the VERY least- you MAY be in for a surprise. Very HIGHLY recommended!!
B000BP86OG|5.0|I loved Permission to Land but this cd is better!The quality of the songs are better and the production is far better.I've very rarely bought a cd that has ten excellent compositions on it but One Way Ticket has just that...simply fantastic...forget the funny lyrics...this cd is superb from start to finish.The Darkness don't take themselves too seriously but they compose seriously good rock songs.Five stars from me...

B000067J1H|5.0|Watch it twice.  No joke, the second time is so much better than the first, kinda like getting high. Anyways, this movie is a complete 180 of what i thought it would be.  The previews made it look simple, two guys hate life, so they start a fight club. in reality, this is one mind numbingly great movie.  By the end of the first watch of this movie, i just didnt know what to think at all.  It was just so....yeah. But after letting it sink into my mind and giving it a second viewing, it was just amazing.  My friends and I dont even refer to Brad Pitt as himself anymore, we call him Tyler Durden because this was obviously one of his best performances.  As Durden, Pitt is damn near addicting, you begin to see why so many people would follow him.  That \\"who cares i do what i want\\" personality is portrayed perfectly on Pitt's part, and Norton, what an underrated actor. This man is a chameleon on the screen, so much so that in the same year he played the neurotic, scrawny wreck in Fight Club, he played the ripped, hate-filled, relentless racist in American History X.  He's one of the best character actors around.  This movie is hard to follow on first watch mainly because its all so out there, it took me til the second watch to realize that Norton is unnamed throughout the entire movie.  If you don't watch it twice, it probably wont be as good. And dont, for the love of god, watch it on TV. FX played it one night and it was just not the same thrill.  Alot of people complain about the violence in this movie, saying its poorly done. Well, thats the idea, these men arent ninjas or professional fighters, they're just normal men, so the fights are filmed just right.  Word to the wise, if you're squemish during brutal fight scenes, turn away when Norton fights Jared Leto (blond guy) its pretty intense. All in all, this movie is a classic cult flick.  Watch it with an open mind....and DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB...sorry i just had to

B0001KZM3O|4.0|Pink Floyd's 12th album, \\"The Final Cut\\", is a very powerful, emotional album. Many fans fail to see it's beauty because it is considered to be mainly just a Roger Waters solo effort, having only the PF name on it. However, in my opinion, this doesn't in any way make it a bad album. Other Waters-dominated albums like \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\" are considered classics, and I consider this to be just as good in most respects, though it IS the MOST heavily Waters-influenced album. But you have to remember that it is STILL the wonderful band of Pink Floyd PERFORMING it as a WHOLE, and it is not just a display of Roger Waters talent alone. It may be his direction (which is rather awesome, by the way), but it is the WHOLE BAND playing it with the INTENSITY and BEAUTY that you come to expect from Pink Floyd. People are a hard breed to figure out- most prefer the mastermind of Waters over Gilmour, but when they get the most heavily Waters-influenced album of all, they don't like it. Waters fans and Pink Floyd fans in general should love this album because it truly showcases the genius mind of Roger Waters, while still containing the UNBELIEVABLE sound of Pink Floyd. It is essentially a sequel to \\"The Wall\\", some of it being written at the same time as that album. In fact, if you watch the movie \\"The Wall\\", you'll notice a song or two from \\"The Final Cut\\" are on there. This album focuses even more on Roger's own personal demons, mainly on the affect of loosing his father at a very young age to the war. Every time I listen to this INCREDIBLE album, I get the chills. VERY powerful and a very rewarding listen if you just give it a chance. I rated it 4 only because it does lack a LITTLE (just a LITTLE!!) of the over-all excitement of the previous several albums. However, this is still a FANTASTIC album from begining to finish, and should be in any fan's PF collection. Highly recommended!!
B000B8QF00|3.0|I agree with Tom.  I was disappointed not to see favorites like \\"Precious Illusions\\", \\"Joining You\\" and \\"Unsent\\".  I would've much rather had those than some of the rarities that were added.  Still a fun album though.

B000002A3T|5.0|Pink Floyd's 14th and possibly last album, \\"The Division Bell\\", is in my opinion one of the legendary band's TOP FIVE GREATEST albums EVER. I can easily call it a MASTERPIECE in every sense of the word, and that would STILL be an understatement! A rich, powerful musical experience not unlike \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or \\"Animals\\", this is some of the most BEAUTIFUL, MOVING, and RELAXING Pink Floyd music you will EVER HEAR!! If this album is truly their last, then they certaintly went out in STYLE and with a BANG! I thought \\"A Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" was unbelievable, but then I heard this INCREDIBLE MASTERPIECE and I have a hard time describing how AWESOME it is in words. Seven years after \\"Momentary\\", in '94, David Gilmour and friends returned to the studio to put out some of the band's most IMPRESSIVE work ever, changing gears a bit from the slight 80's sound to a more atmospheric, relaxing \\"new\\" sound not unlike much of the band's most CLASSIC works. EXTREMELY soothing and breathtaking while at the same time being a VERY emotional experience, this album is BY FAR David Gilmour's GREATEST achievements and ranks as the one of the Floyd's ABSOLUTE BEST, in my rare and somewhat unpopular opinion. Many PF fans hate the Gilmour-led Floyd, while some have grown to really love and appreciate it. I happen to be part of the \\"some\\". This is an album that you will either \\"get\\" or \\"not get\\". However, if you disliked Pink Floyd's first post-Waters album \\"Momentary\\", don't be leery and give this one a chance! Many who hated that album tend to like THIS ONE better, so keep an open mind. But if you think Roger Waters was the ONLY talent the band had to offer, you may be a little hard-pressed to accept this astonishing piece of work- go listen to Waters-led Floyd. Those albums are epic masterpieces as well, so I guess in my opinion, you just CAN NOT go wrong with Pink Floyd ANYWHERE! I just happen to like Gilmour as much as Waters. The album cover is one of the most classy coversStorm Thurgeson has ever constructed for the band, and is a picture of \\"seperation\\", or \\"division\\"(obviously), in the most simplest sense. \\"Marooned\\" stands as one of Pink Floyd's greatest instrumentals, while \\"Coming Back To Life\\" and \\"Keep Talking\\" stand on their own level as well. \\"High Hopes\\" is one of my top three FAVORITE PF songs of all time, closing this mesmerizing album with utmost beauty and class. And I can safely there is NOT ONE bad track on the entire album-from beginning to end it will take you on a musical journey through many gorgeous musical landscapes that you will NEVER forget. Atleast, that's how it affected THIS fortunate listener. AT the very least, you owe it to yourself to give \\"The Division Bell\\" a shot- it just may become one of the MOST rewarding and satisfying listens you will ever experience, packed with David Gilmour's masterful guitar-playing and voice you have come to  LOVE and APPRECIATE.  HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie single handedly got me hooked on the entire Firefly/Serenity universe. Before I watched the movie I hadn't even seen an episode of firefly, and now I can't get enough. Serenity does an excellent job as a stand alone film, there is no need to see the series first or have any background info before going into the movie. You will get all the info you need to enjoy the film in the first few minutes of the movie. I can't say enough good things about this movie! It is incredible! I would rate this movie as one of my favorites!
B000002MFN|3.0|While Madonna's Erotica album was meant to be a companion to the Sex book, it couldn't have been released at a worst time. Back in 1992, the media had a field day tearing Madonna apart for her sexually charged work in film, music, and for the first time in print. I mean, let's face it: we can't even discuss the album without mentioning THE BOOK. The book itself isn't as titilating as it is a bit naughty, and it's all very tongue in cheek. As for the album, much of the material couldn't even be classified as erotic. The first single/title track is merely suggestive, Madonna plays Dita, who promises/threatens a very interesting night in her dungeon. It's really all about Madonna striking more poses than anything else, also the case with the accompanying video and the photos in the book. Madonna is in various stages of undress, thrown into seedy sexual underworlds, at high class sex parties, eating pizza and hitchhiking in the buff. \\"Hey, it's a living\\", she seems to say, as she presses her breasts up against a windshield. Whatever the \\"Erotica\\" single was supposed to be, it's a dark, but not that daring turn on a long winding journey through artistic progression. This album is her darkest work, tetter tottering between pissed off, detached woman to broken, vulnerable little girl. She tells a lover to hit the road in \\"Bye Bye Baby\\", but doesn't really sound aggressive enough for her big talk to stick. \\"Words\\", her response to criticism and scrutiny sounds as though she is more hurt than vengeful. \\"Bad Girl\\" could be autobiographical in its depiction of a woman whose hedonistic behavior is doing her in. \\"I'm not happy when I act this way\\", she sings. And we believe her. She really doesn't sound happy on much of Erotica. The sassy cover of Peggy Lee's \\"Fever\\" doesn't quite match the original. Here, Madonna sounds pretty icy and not really all that eager to heat things up, which could be good or bad depending on how one feels about covers. Even on the triumphant disco-anthem \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", she doesn't sound as though she's celebrating love, but is acknowledging the price you pay for it. Don't get me wrong, her bitter sweet sensiblity and causal approach does work. But overall it's an album that explores pain rather than sex, which could have been the whole point. \\"Rain\\" is doused with a refreshing warmth and should rank as one her best ballads. I never understood why it didn't chart higher than it did. The single contains the breakthrough that changes the album at the very end. \\"Here comes the sun,\\" she sings,referencing the Beatles both in blissful pop song lyrical frolic and  a tendency to lean towards the avant garde in sound. Sound wise, Erotica is a minimal beat driven machine, with scaled down melodies, and house music that is only rough around the edges and at the core, anything from light jazz to lounge to hip hop (the rap in \\"Waiting\\" is much better than the one in \\"American Life\\"). \\"Why's it so Hard\\" is a call to arms to love thy neighbor as thyself, like many of Madonna's celebratory songs like \\"Keep it Together\\" and \\"Holiday\\" do best. Here, it comes after a media frenzy and an indentity built around controversy, freedom, independence and power. After all, 1992 was the year Madonna launched Maverick Records. What makes Erotica so different, is that in the one outlet that she set out to do, she isn't concerned about making a perfect album. Instead, Erotica is an intriguing and unusual animal in a career packed with glossy pop, some nice ballads, and some of the best dance songs os the past two decades. It derives it's energy not from what it lacks, but what it seperates itself from. Like Madonna's life it is a work in progress. She's up all night, plotting her next move, absorbing information at the speed of light, and at the cusp of something without ever really getting there.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Yes, I'm really sorry because you know, I really like this group but I didn't like this album, and when I red the reviews I said: No!!, I have to tell the truths of this group. So... <br />1.- Yes, SOAD is one of the toughest bands in political music, maybe, the strongest since Rage Against The Machine. <br />2.- Yes, they have a lot of creativity to mix so many different rythms in a single song <br />3.- Yes, they are very talented musicians. <br />But you know what: <br />4.- No! This is not a great SOAD album, the wait wasn't worthy. <br />5.- There are two things that I love the most of this group: <br />5.1.- The Vocals of the Lead Singer. God!! I think he is great and the magic he puts in the songs are unquestionable. But... What's the f#\\"$\\"&ng problem with Daron Malakian?? Who told him that he could sing?? I mean, yes, he is cool for some chorus but come on, he takes so much time singing in Mezmerize that takes very valuable vocal time from Serj Tankian. In my very humble opinion, he should stay right behind of his guitar and ocassionaly, very ocassionaly, in front of the mic. <br />5.2.- The Drums. To me, this drummer is one of the best in history!! You can literally hear him playing another song with great variation of rythms while playing a SOAD song. I mean, he plays a bunch of different styles and rythms in every song. But when I first listened to mezmerize, I honestly taught that he has left SOAD. In this record, the drummer only keeps with the song, nothing is refreshing, nothing is different from the tune style, everything stays as if any other drummer would have played it. <br />6.- So, I'm terribly sorry to tell this, but Mezmerize lost the drums and voice that made distinctable this band, and for that, I can honestly say that I'm dissapointed.  <br /> <br />Then, why 3 stars?? Well, after all, it's SOAD.  <br />
B00082IJ08|4.0|These days, music is very controversial. It seems that everywhere you go, there is always someone who thinks their music is the best music on the planet. I am one of the many fortunate people to stumble upon the Gorillaz album titled Demon Days. I'll admit that I was pretty cautious about buying it - the two singles, \\"DARE\\" and \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" got old quickly, and if the whole album was just as good as those two, I would have been disappointed. <br /> <br />Very fortunately, though, I picked it up. I was craving something new, something unique and different. I bought the special edition album with a DVD containing some things concerning the \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" video and a bonus track among other things. It wasn't too interesting, so I was a little frustrated that I had spent an extra four dollars on something I didn't even like. <br /> <br />I popped in the CD with high hopes, trying to keep an open mind. I'll admit, \\"Intro\\" was a little too `out there' for me and I was hoping that the album was better than this. \\"Last Living Souls\\" began playing, and much to my pleasant surprise, I was hooked. The soft, mellow vocals blended in with the furious guitar perfectly and the percussion only makes the song sound more modern. About one minute into it, I could tell that this album would be different. It's very futuristic and has a bit of a space theme to it. <br /> <br />\\"Kids with guns / Kids with guns / Taking over / But it won't be long,\\" the vocals chant on the album's next track, \\"Kids With Guns\\". The song sounds very urban, which might be because of the title. The beat to this song is amazingly simple, yet it sounds very deep. \\"Kids With Guns\\", while simplistic in lyrics, has a great hook and a chorus that will be stuck in your head against your will. <br /> <br />The insane introduction to \\"O Green World\\" began as I listened intently. The guitar work here is pretty nice - the annoying vocals in the background, however, make this song my least favorite. The song itselfis really up-beat and bouncy, it does not blend in with the album very well. Redeeming it, however, is the song following it. I'm talking about \\"Dirty Harry\\", my favorite song on the album. A choir of what sound like adolescents begins the song and the electric music plays for awhile until it fades out a little bit, and the best part commences - the rapping. I'll admit that the furious vocals are a little hard to listen to at first, but they become the highlight of the song after a couple of listens. Even though I dislike rap strongly, I can't help but think of \\"Dirty Harry\\" as a masterpiece. <br /> <br />The band's most popular single, \\"Feel Good Inc.\\", follows. It really is something to listen to, especially when you listen to it for the first time. The catchy, dark moans turn into a beautiful verse of singing with a guitar solo... and finally, a little rapping. The rapping is what makes this song, it's catchy and annoying; but you can't help but love it. Lyrically, this song is insane. Basically, you have to have your own interpretation of these lyrics because they make absolutely no sense. <br /> <br />Demon Days takes a more soft (almost acoustic) turn with \\"El Maana\\". I like this song a lot. While a lot less upbeat and intense as the others, the vocals and guitar work really shine here. It's a little angst-driven, but it certainly isn't whiny. Following \\"El Maana\\" is another softer song, \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\". This song summed up in three words: `boring', `slow', and `long'. The electronic music is pretty good, but chances are you won't be sucked into the song too long to actually notice them. <br /> <br />I like \\"November Has Come\\". It has a bit of a reggae (or \\"Jamaican music\\" to those of you who don't know) feel to it. It's urban like \\"Dirty Harry\\", but it lacks a catchy hook or explosive lyrics to get you intrigued. It's nice to listen to every once in awhile, though, I guess. <br /> <br />\\"All Alone\\" is cool. The constantly shifting voices chanting \\"all alone\\" over and over again sound great for some reason. It's spooky and mysterious, but fun to listen to. This song also has a bit of a reggae feel to it - more than \\"November Has Come\\", actually - and it's one of the better songs on the album. It's very beachy and would be the perfect summer single. \\"White Light\\" is just too cool to hate. The vocals, while very hard to listen to, are unique in the sense that they sound like they are being whispered into a microphone. The whole song is just \\"White light / White light / White light / Alcohol, alcohol, alcohol / White light\\" over again, but I like it anyway. <br /> <br />It's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up, it's coming up... it's \\"DARE\\"! The climax of the album, it's a great pop/dance song that anyone can appreciate. It sounds like a mix of British pop with something straight from the 80s. The female vocals here are perfect. There just aren't very many bad things you can say about the song, aside from the fact that it gets old after awhile. While \\"DARE\\" is great, the next song is even better. I'm talking about \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\". What makes the song so great? It's a story, all narrated with two small, sung choruses. The narration here is amazing, as is the story it's telling. It's all timed perfectly. <br /> <br />A small angelic noise plays, and \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" begins. I'm going to rate it and \\"Demon Days\\" both as one song; the first fades into the latter and they sound similar. The choir is beautiful and sounds like something straight out of Rent. It's fun to listen to if you're feeling down. The latter song, \\"Demon Days\\", has a cheesy (yet inspirational) statement surrounding it - \\"It's a brand new day.\\" <br /> <br />Now, I'd like to go back to the first paragraph in this review. The reason I wrote it is because an wacky cartoon band called \\"Gorillaz\\" found a way to combine many genres, make it sound great, and make it look easy. If you're a fan of any of the following genres, this album is for you: alternative rock, hip-hop/rap, reggae, inspirational, choir music, acoustic, electronic, dance, or pop. Do you fit into one of those? If so, do yourself a favor - check this album out, you won't regret it. If you're still hesitant to buy it, there is a free album sampler you can download on iTunes. <br /> <br /> <br />Recommended tracks: \\"Dirty Harry\\"; \\"Feel Good Inc.\\"; \\"DARE\\"; \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\" <br /> <br />Least favored tracks: \\"O Green World\\"; \\"Every Planed We Reach is Dead\\" <br /> <br />Also check out: \\"Last Stop: This Town\\" - Eels; \\"South Side feat. Gwen Stefani\\" - Moby
0142004413|5.0|I first heard about this book in one of SARK's books and was intrigued by the title.  I'm surprised this book is not more well-known.  Charming, intelligent, witty, and hilarious.  What more could you want??
B000002NJS|5.0|Like most Madonna fans , I remember the release date like it was yesterday. 1998's Ray of Light is nothing short of brilliant. For Madonna, the 90's have had its share of ups and downs. From the backlash of the early 90's to seeing 1994's \\"Take a Bow\\" become her best selling single, to playing Evita, to having a child. Ray of Light seems to be the culmination of what she was going for in the 90's. Madonna has always strived to back up her beats with meaning, but all too often her singles are generally known for serving as big and flashy mirrors to reflect the fashion trends, sexuality and dance moves at the particular time. It wasn't really until 1986's True Blue and 1989's Like a Prayer (her best) that Madonna matured with her ever evolving music. Being the culture sponge that she is, it was only a matter of time before she leaped into what was supposed to be \\"The Next Big Thing\\" of the mid to late 90's: electronica. For those who have said this is new to her, in a way it is, the way it is used in the context of Ray of Light, an album centered around bubbly, beeping cyber pop. Madonna has always been sweet on the synth beats; the synthesizer became the backbone of her early hits like \\"Holiday\\", \\"Lucky Star\\", and \\"Like a Virgin\\". Ray's producer William Orbit has done remix work for her in the past on such singles as \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\", and 1995's \\"Bedtime Story\\" was co-written by Bjork (who is one of the very few electronic artists that have supported Madonna's latest foray into rave culture)and like much of the Bedtime Stories album, was produced by  Nellee Hooper, who has worked with Bjork on several of her albums and has also produced Soul II Soul. Ray of Light reads like a guidebook for any artist who strives for reinvention. It has been the formula that has worked (most of the time) for Madonna. Here, Madonna is warm, cuddly, and maternal. Gone is the teasing come ons, the polished, well calculated dance numbers, and the bitter feelings towards those who have put her down over the years, themes that have dominated much of the singer's work in the 1990's. Opening with \\"Drowned World (Substitute for Love)\\", the album's consistent theme is introspection. She warns of the trappings of fame on this song, and she will try to mimic the message on recent albums like 'American Life' and 'Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" and not get too far with it. Here, the slow ballad turns into a rocking, electro-folk tune that evokes a feeling of a world spun out of control by the spotlight. Madonna is impressive in her ability to counter feeling with dance music. \\"Ray of Light\\", is a party song at the end of the world, with a head spinning sound that leaves you breathless. \\"Frozen\\", the first single, is not in the least bit cold. Madonna's voice never sounded so good and the tribal/middle eastern beats make the perfect team. Coming off Evita, Ray's vocals are stunningly beauiful. I loved \\"Nothing Really Matter's and didn't understand why it was overlooked when it was released as the last single. Maybe the bizzarre geisha girl video had something to do with it. Still, its easily one of the album's most accessible dance songs. \\"Little Star\\" is a high tech digitalized lullabye that flourishes and takes shape, blossoming into a sweet song which somehow avoids being labeled as sap. One of the more interesting cuts is \\"Mer Girl\\", in which Madonna explores her mother's death and her own survival techniques that sounds like a poetry reading. It's dark, eerie, and a nice contrast to Ray of Light's slick, and embracing demeanor. Ray of Light is much more than a pop comeback, its a celebration of artistic growth and an overall classic record that is sure to stand the test of time.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Casino is a masterpiece....hands down, and I don't think anyone will disagree with me on that....but is this the special edition that was released not to long ago? It states the release date as January 2006...however, it was just released on DVD about 6 months ago! I find it hard to believe this is yet another edition...can anyone shed some light on this? If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and buy it.
0393316041|5.0|\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman\\" was a very funny, informative, and it seemed like you where actually there with him when he talked about his personal experiences.  I learned quite about physics I would have never thought have related to, and that the military needed physicists to actually operate at a high achieving level.  The first chapter was even worth reading about how he made a living from just fixing radios when he was around 10.  Mr. Feynman was a very honest man, even if the truth hurt.  With that, probably thanks to him many things are better for what he did such as the locks and tumblers or the research he had done with the Challenger disaster.  I think this book everyone should read, it is a very inspiring book to learn more about the earth.  It is an all around book, it has its funny moments its serious moments and above all Mr. Feynman when he talked it seemed like he was teaching you.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|This album displays alicia key's talent as an artist. The girl is only 24 years old. But she is fresh and new and doing something from her heart.  Yeah, she was stretching the chords a bit too much but I am sure it was not done purposely.  The problem I have with people is that as soon as an artist reaches a peak in their career where they are very popular the fans are basically looking for something wrong.  Half of you can't sing or play piano and would not have the ability to do what she has done.The arrangements of the songs were like they were freshly done.  She is a great performer, writer, producer, and a creative species that I hope we can see more of.  So all you haters are full of it.  Beyonce can see sing but she sells sex and she had that special look.  Now are the new artist female artist are following her tracks but nothing is original. Beyonce will play out and better stick to acting.  Once she gets married and have a child the shape is over.  Not once does alicia sell sex or come out with seductive clothing..  She displays her heart, her talent, her emotion, and most all her ability to be different.  Artist have to have the package and she does.  With this, she will be around for a long time and has time to grow as an artist and remain interesting to the fans.  So give her credit, please!!!!

B000AU9UYC|2.0|Most of us remember the Batman (1966) movie and the tv series (1966-68) starring Adam West and Burt Ward. The cartoons as well.    Then in 1989, began a series of four Batman films:    Batman (1989), starring Michael Keaton.    Batman Returns (1992), starring Michael Keaton.    Batman Forever (1995), starring Val Kilmer.    Batman Returns (1997), starring George Clooney.    And now Christian Bale will play the much darker version of \\"Batman\\".  Bale had lost a horrifying amount of weight down to 100 pounds for the role in The Machanist (2004) and quickly had to beef up and put the muscle back up and out for the Caped Crusader role.  This adult \\"Batman\\" version is not to be thought of with the version Michael Keaton began with in 1989.    BATMAN BEGINS (2005) is a brand new metropolitan (metrosexual) Batman as originally written when known as \\"The Dark Knight\\", to begin a new era of films.  This \\"Batman\\" is a harder, more violent one.    This story might be based on \\"The Dark Knight\\" comic books or \\"The Batman\\" film serial (1943) starring Lewis Wilson and Douglas Croft.    2005 has not been a good year for remakes as the stories have been poorly written and badly cast.    Perhaps the next \\"Batman\\" film in 2008 will have more potential.    Special Features are only available on your personal computer's ROM-Drive.    [[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]] was released July 18, 2008. Heath Ledger as \\"The Joker\\" in one of his final films. His last film, [[ASIN:B001HN69AY The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]] (2009).    Update: The Dark Knight Rises will be released July 20 2012.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Lets clear this up. I'm tired of people saying \\"I am a long time S.O.A.D. fan and I hate this crap because it's not Toxicity or their debut\\". And what do I say? So What!!! This album is still System of a Down and it it still great. The changes in their music goes with every band, and System being around for 7 years now, of course the music is going to change and progress. System of a Down has never given us bad music before, and they haven't now. And also... it's not teen agnst music, it's political, so if you want teen agnst go listen to Slipknot or something. So now that's cleared up, on with the album!    Two words... it's great. If you liked Mezmerize, then for sure you will like this. Songs like \\"Attack\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Hypnotize (released as a single earlier), \\"Tentative\\" and \\"Solider Side\\" make up the best songs on this album. \\"Vicinity of Obscenity\\", even though it is pretty random and \\"Stealing Society\\" are both good listens. This may not \\"feel\\" or sound like the old System, but for sure it is System nontheless and I think it's great.    But, it isn't perfect. Daron Malakian is not the best singer, and songs that he is mainly singing, \\"Lonely Day\\" and \\"She's Like Heroin\\" are not that good. Even though people are complaining he is the worst singer of all time and he made the album bad, (he's not that bad) I would rather have Serj go back to being the main singer and Daron backing up, because he is good harmonically and singing along or behind with Serj. It was bearable on Mezmerize, but now it is a little too much, but it doesn't ruin the album like other morons are saying. Anyway, overall Hypnotize, even though not quite Mezmerize or Toxicity, is a great album that is worth every penny, even if you are not a System of a Down fan.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This is a great cd, on many levels. We finally get a new blues rocker who can really play, sing and write. As a live release it shows the band raw, not afraid to show blemishes. No, John isn't Hendrix or SRV. Who is? But he sure can play. Some \\"purists\\" posting reviews conveniently forget the rap given to both Hendrix & SRV by \\"purists\\" back in the day--that both were just pale imitations of Albert King. I guess that Mayer is suburban, white & rich takes his cred for blues down, but what about Mike Bloomfield, an upper middle class Jewish kid from the Chicago suburbs? Gonna discredit him too?  <br />      <br />     The fact is this--this CD brings the real stuff to a new generation of listeners, more so than Johnnie Lang or the other young players. No disrespect to them, but Mayer has millions of fans already. if 25% get into this (our) music, start listening to blues, start supporting other artists, we get a giant kick. My guess is that B.B. King is thankful to Eric Clapton & John Mayall for getting  white kids in the US to listen to blues, and to him. We should embrace John Mayer as a soulmate, don't push him away just because we wish our bank accounts matched up.
B000000W5N|5.0|In April 1971, the Rolling Stones continued their legendary run of brilliant music with the release of 'Sticky Fingers', their first album under their own record label, albeit released through Atlantic. New decade? No problem. Death of an original member? Didn't matter. Altamount? Mounting drug dependency of musical mastermind? Pending UK tax difficulties? The Stones machine rolled on into the 1970's with another masterpiece. New lead guitarist Mick Taylor officially debuted here and his contributions were immense. The songs cover a fairly wide range of the Stones' various styles and for the most part, they all count. Opening single \\"Brown Sugar\\" fits easily among the great rock classics that the Stones already had in their formidable canon. A tale of sleaze, slavery and sex is punctuated by one of Keef's most memorable riffs and also the sweet sax of his other \\"blood brother\\" Bobby Keyes. \\"Wild Horses\\" the classic Stones country ballad makes its first appearance here as well along with \\"You Gotta Move\\", Mississippi delta at its finest. All of the three aforementioned tunes were recorded on the road in 1969 at Muscle Shoals Studios, right near the delta that gave birth to the idea of the Rolling Stones, home of the blues. Other rock standards and favorites include \\"Bitch\\" (awesome guitar work here), \\"Sway\\"(love the count in...), \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin\\" (great lead guitar work from young Mr. Taylor), \\"Dead Flowers\\" and of course the hauntingly evil \\"Sister Morphine\\". Everybody probably has their own favorites and for many 'Sticky Fingers' was the ultimate Stones album but in my humble opinion, THAT album was recorded in the following summer of '71 in a little village in the south of France.....the party showed no signs of slowing down!

B00005JNBQ|4.0|OK, granted, this film wasn't the final word in high brow humor, but it was FUN and it did depict the quirky life of a nerd or two (Napoleon and his 32 year old uber-nerd brother) in an entertaining fashion as seen by an up-and-coming young Film Director.  The part where Napoleon's brother finally meets LaFawnda in the flesh (his online cyber-girlfriend), and where he radically changes his fashion sense to accomodate her 'shizzle ma nizzle' urban rap/dance culture was a friggin' LAUGH-RIOT!  Pat Boone singing Heavy Metal tunes a couple of years ago was nothing compared to this character transformation!  The only part of the film I didn't like, was when they said 'POP' instead of 'SODA', but hey, what do you expect in Idaho?  LOL!  They say the same thing out here in redneck Ohio, despite the fact that in NATIONAL TV ads and shows they say 'SODA'.  Thank God for places like New York and California!  But I digress...
B000B0WODA|4.0|this cd is as good if not better than the last.  and dont listen to those nerds evaluating the lyrics and all that, sometimes people just write music. my friend bob wrote a song about being a teenage vampire and shooting things with glocks and he is def not a vampire nor does he shoot or have a glock to shoot things. so i say buy it, love it, share it. and dont listen to the other negative ding dongs   <br />that over analyzed the cd
B000BP86OG|1.0|PTL was an absolutely amazing album.  A testament to all that is guitar driven RAWK.  OWTTHAB on the other hand is a different story.  Who the hell produced this album?  They should be shot.  All the edge of the previous album has been replaced with a bunch of overproduced crap.  Dan and Justin are way too good of guitar players to have wasted their talent on a crap album like this.  I hope this album grows on me, because it is SEVERELY dissapointing.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This album is such a very good one. And like all other albums of Shakira, every single song in this project has a very great sense. And the tune? Very appealing to the ears. <br /> <br />Song by song the album goes, story by story unfolds with a meaning that covers almost all, if not all, people. That in other words, Shakira sings things that matter to all people in all walks of life. <br /> <br />Oral Fixation Vol.2 touches issues like religion, love, politics, anger, jealousy and many other else. And the melody, the instrumentals, make an impact for every song. <br /> <br />This album is one evidence, and a reason in some way, that meaning and beauty of melody go together. Shakira did it again! And she keeps the world screaming for more!
B000BNI99K|5.0|What makes this series so rare is that the 4 volumes all compliment each other.  Rod Stewart's voice is in great form and the arrangements are so simple and unassuming that you simply enjoy the music from one disc to the next.  Great for the holidays, dinnertime, when company is over, right before you go to sleep etc.  My favorite duet is the one with Cher from volume 2 but if you dont happen to care for an artist that Rod is duetting with rest assured that it doesnt take away from the realxing quality of the set as a whole. Although this isnt Sinatra its great to have a box of light standards that please from one disc to the next.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I was disappointed with this film but my reasons differ somewhat from those given by other reviewers. This one still has the technical excellence of the first two in terms of effects and production values. It also does a fair job of following the book although there are elements that have to be cut in any such adaptation. It is certainly a darker episode than the first two but so was the book. My complaint is different. The new director needlessly made changes that didn't have to be made. <br /> <br />Some of the changes involve sets. The feel of the story is different. There is no real story telling reason for the change; it seems the changes were made for their own sake. <br /> <br />Other changes that seem to be made for their own sake do involve the story line. Nothing was accomplished by the changes. They don't seem to have added to the story and, I must admit, they don't really detract all that much. They are just different without having to be. It is almost as if the book was not good enough. That is a far cry from a book being too difficult to film. <br /> <br />The story involves Harry's 3rd year at the Hogwarts Academy for wizards. Once again, skullduggery is afoot and Harry and his friends are intent on straightening things out. This time, a fearsome wizard has escaped from prison and it is common knowledge that the wizard wants Harry dead. His being Harry's Godfather makes the tale more convoluted and the twists and turns really start occurring when many of the characters are not who they seem to be. <br /> <br />It's a good movie adaptation of a book but it is not in the same league as the others. <br />
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I was going to buy the CD from Amazon or somewhere else cause I have not buy CD's in a while or ask for it for Christmas.  I really feel your pain about this annoying encryption on CD's<br /><br />that is doing illegal, brutal things to our nice home PC's.<br /><br />Normally these CD's are creating confusion to the customers and fellow listeners of the Foo Fighters.  If they don't play in regular high end CD players, I bet the DJ at the radio station<br /><br />wouldn't even try to promote the new CD on the radio cause of the playing equipment, or mobile DJ's may want to play this CD at parties.  I have listened to one track in limewire and I never ever heard it on the radio or XM.  Maybe they should bring back cassette tapes and make a two tape album of this since you can't upload tapes easily and just deal with the hiss and use Dolby B noise reduction.  Personally I don't like the song since I sampled it from limewire and I believe protecting something that does not sound good is a just a waste of time.<br /><br />Copy Protected CD's are not CD's.  Since VHS became a copy written thing and DVD they do deserve protection. I also<br /><br />wish that Phillips would of came out with this along time ago<br /><br />with a special bit code instead of ILLEGAL software.  But they didn't. the software is creating technical and cyber terrorism to innocent prople who love music.<br /><br />The DCMA is getting brutal and one day there will be lots of CD players this holiday season and next year that will be returned for a refund cause of this anti-pirate crap that messed up the circuitry in the new CD players.  Thank you very much for sony's crime. We might as well open more repair shops!  We didn't do it Sony did it.
B000B86S1Q|4.0|PS, I LOVE YOU is a beautiful, touching novel. <br /> <br />It tells the story of how a very young widow copes with the loss of her husband during the first year following his death. <br /> <br />Cecelia Ahern writes a sweet and insightful story, piercing as to its insights regarding the pain of losing the person one loves the most. <br /> <br />The spine of the plot hinges on the young husband, realizing that his end was imminent, writing a year's worth of notes, one each month, to be opened by his widow after his death.   <br /> <br />These notes reveal how well he knew her, and how much he loved her. Each note is both inspirational as well as pragmatically instructive as to how she is to live her life. <br /> <br />The brief biography of the author, illustrated with a photo of a radiantly pretty young woman, discloses--in the very first sentence--that she is the daughter of Ireland's Prime Minister. <br /> <br />Perhaps this relationship is the reason that the book is not better edited; perhaps she was treated with the proverbial kid gloves, instead of the firm red pencil that many parts of her work require. <br /> <br />The beginning of this novel is slow, and so poorly written that it seems to have a different author from the remainder of what is a reasonably long book. <br /> <br />Too, there are consistent difficulties with tense (past, past perfect, etc.) throughout the book. These grammatical glitches interfere with the flow of the prose in what truly is a very interesting story. <br /> <br />Were it not for the issues described above, PS, I LOVE YOU clearly would deserve five-stars here. Even at just four stars, though, it is a wonderful read, touching and rich and complex.
B00062RBOA|4.0|This a very interesting DVD with no doubt, like all those conducted by this strange and wonderful conductor that is Carlos Kleiber. I knew his Brahms's Fourth with the Wiener Philharmoniker (DG), and some of his Beethoven concerts (some of them on DVD) and that were the reasons for buying this DVD, apart from the very interesting concerts this man use to conducts. <br /> <br />But what we have here is not the very high level of excellence you can listen in his recording with the Wiener Philharmoniker (DVD and CD, DG) or the Concertegebouworkest Amsterdam (DVD, Philips). <br /> <br />The conducting is, like in most of his performances, intense, electrifying, vivid, technical... Apart from having the sensation that you are watching a very prepared concert, probably played after having a lot of rehearsals, because of the way sometimes he conducts or don't. Kleiber is a particular case in conducting, in the sense of his feeling of the tempo is still very fresh even being an old man, when in many other cases the tempi use to get very slow when the conductors become more than 60, 70 years old (of course not all of them). Kleiber continues with his full of life and freshness versions, like the Brahms' 4th he recorded in the early `80s with the wieners. <br /> <br />His recording of Brahms' Fourth with Vienna is one of my favourites, together with Bernstein (Vienna, DG) and Giulini (Vienna, DG), but this DVD one could be better because of the Bayerisches Staatsorchester is not really a first class orchestra. Woodwinds and metal is not perfect technically and their musicality is not so close to Brahms' one like Vienna does. The way Kleiber understand the symphony is quite similar to the one you can listen on CD (DG), but the final result is not so good. <br /> <br />Mozart's Symphony is fresh and clear, but nowadays I use to prefer Mozart on authentic instruments, like Harnoncourt or Hogwood does. <br /> <br />Coriolan is very interesting on Kleiber hands because of the wayhe use to conducts Beethoven (remember his 5th and 7th with Vienna or his program with the Concertgebouworkest on DVD), a very direct and powerful version, but clear and energetic like his other recordings. But... again the orchestra is not that miracle of Beethoven's 5 with Vienna. <br /> <br />The film is good and offers lot of shots of Kleiber conducting, as I thought it would be with a legendary conductor like him. If you want to watch him on the stage this is a DVD for you, if you want his top performance from the technical point of view, in the highest orchestral level, you should go to his DG recordings or the DVD with Beethoven released by Philips. <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira is fantastic on this album.. my favorite songs are \\"don't bother\\", and \\"illegal\\".. two fabulous new cuts.. but every song on this album is top notch, sung with emotion, and its also amazing that the singer wrote all these songs.. and sings them in a language foreign to her own.. an amazing work, buy it, you won't be sorry.. God bless this amazing talent!!
0446577383|4.0|I had a very mixed reaction to this book by David Baldacci, an author whose work I have often praised in the past. As detailed in this review, there were parts which I enjoyed immensely and yet a few aspects which meaningfully detracted from my enjoyment. By the time that I had concluded writing this review, I finally settled on what might be an overly generous compromise four star rating as a reflection of my enjoyment despite problems with some problems with some facets of the plot and its totally unbelievable nature. However, I was disappointed by three factors. First, aspects of the political message inherent in the plot development seemed almost overtly propagandist. (At times I felt as if I were reading a Richard North Patterson book.) Second, the author seemed willing to slow the pace of the narration considerably to provide great explanatory detail about some aspects (e.g. the mental state and background of some of the protagonists) but alternated such interludes with  moving the action forward at breakneck speed furnishing very minimal background information. Last, certain elements of the conclusion were not satisfactorily explained. I will not discuss this last criticism in this review, since I cannot do so include without including spoilers.    The story opens with a brief prologue that immediately foreshadows one of the key elements of the plot. The reader is then immediately introduced to Oliver Stone, a tortured loner with a violent past who is currently one of the protesters allowed to maintain a presence in Lafayette Park across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. (If you visit DC, this is a scene you should see.) The sign outside Oliver's tent reads I WANT THE TRUTH, and this enigmatic statement sets the stage for the story. What events have led to Oliver's current situation? Is he simply another conspiracy nut? (Some of whom occasionally do stumble across the truth.) Will the reader ever learn Oliver's true identity? (Yes, but not until nearthe conclusion and while his history is extremely relevant his name is not, except to a few participants in the story.) We are soon introduced to Caleb Shaw, Reuben Rhodes, and Milton Farb, Oliver's friends and the other members of the top secret CAMEL CLUB, whose history and name are eventually explained as the story unfolds. The group then retreats to their prearranged clandestine meeting on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River.     In another scene shift, we have been introduced to Secret Service Agent Alex Ford and his favorite bartender Kate Adams, who is a moonlighting DOJ attorney. We have also already been introduced to President James Brennan and his intelligence chief Carter Gray, who will also be major characters in the story. Next, the members of THE CAMEL CLUB witness a murder which has been foreshadowed in one of the introductory chapters, and the action rockets forward as the lives of all these DC participants are increasingly drawn together and the members of THE CAMEL CLUB furiously try to unravel a political conspiracy which they gradually understand simultaneously threatens both their own lives and the future stability of the world political order. Meanwhile, in further scene shifts, we have also met an entire cast of additional characters whose roles will gradually unfold. There are the many Muslims whose dedication to their faith and willingness to sacrifice their lives is central to the plot and also their coordinator - the mercenary Captain Jack. There is Oliver's neighbor in tent city - a seemingly bit player who suddenly assumes a very important role and whose history is as interesting as Oliver's. Finally, there is Tom Hemingway, Carter Grey's number two, a man with incredible physical and psychological abilities and whose perceived relationship with Kate is of immediate concern to Alex.    The pace is breakneck, the plot is very inventive and has several unexpected twists (unfortunately many strain the reader's credulity) and thestory involves politics, romance and several  interesting characters - if you are a speed reader and don't worry about the details these factors may be enough to make it a five star read for you. However, the book's political dimension far surpasses the plot - there several segments which come perilously close to political propaganda and stereotyping of the type not found in Baldacci's other work. My interpretation of these scenes (some are dialogues, some are mental monologues; some are brief and subtle, some are prolonged and in your face) is that they reflect two attributes of Balducci's work. First, they obviously result from his detailed research and his desire for making his characters realistic. A second  related point is that the incredible audacity of the concept which forms the basis for the central storyline of the book only becomes believable if he succeeds in establishing the authenticity of the characters involved. And the fact that he successfully achieved that goal in my case is why I rated the book four stars.    Despite my observations concerning the story's flaws, I didn't want to put the book down although I was tempted to skim over a few parts (but did not). I really liked Oliver and his mates in THE CAMEL CLUB; I was intrigued by many of the other characters; I hated the villains (when I correctly identified them); and I was tremendously upset at the sudden and shocking death of one of the \\"good guys\\" (and also surprised at the survival of some of them).. And while I don't share some of the political viewpoints seemingly implicitly endorsed by the book, I did not feel that it was totally onesided in its depiction of the issues involved; based on my first hand experience I in fact agree with two of the implicit messages of the story. First, that many of the decisions made by politicians today suffer from a lack of creative thinking and result from seriously outdated preconceptions. Second, that most politicians and bureaucrats are much more concerned with doing the safe thing (which often means consensus action) than doing the right thing even if it involves risk to their careers.    My summary - if you like political thrillers with interesting plots set in the contemporary world, read this book despite its flaws. Then, like me, you will wonder if the conclusion has set us up for a sequel in which some of these characters will reappear. Perhaps fittingly THE CAMEL CLUB will solve a mystery involving the Arabian desert or less likely the National Zoo.    Tucker Andersen
B000B8QEZG|4.0|First CD I have purchased in a long time with no regrets.<br /><br />Every song is memorable, the lyrics are empowering without being preachy. Hypnotic beats keep you locked into Madonna's world and literally make you feel like you're in a highrise dance club.  My mind takes a trip everytime I play the CD, which is nice when you're sitting at your desk for 8 hours a day.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from giving the album 5 stars is that song #5 \\"I love New York\\", was subpar for me...in fact, Id go so far to say it's 'stupid' compared to the rest of the album.  It's the only song that seems silly and has nothing to offer me.  But, cut that song out, and the album is absolutely snap.  Finally Madonna gets fun again and does what she does best: make you want to get up and dance :)
B000063COX|5.0|Iron Maiden released their first, full-length, self-titled album in 1980. Little did they know that they would eventually be part of one of the most known heavy metal bands of all-time (well Steve and Dave would be). Although it isn't the \\"classic line-up\\", the line-up of Steve Harris, Dave Murray, Denis Stratton, Clive Burr and of coarse Paul Dianno is definatly an impressive one. Paul definatly rocks. He is just a no-BS rocker and that shows in this album. His rough voice helps make this Maiden's most raw album.<br /><br />One of the other reasons I like this so much is the punk-metal style. This can't really be compared to later releases such as  Number of the Beast or  Powerslave. The opening riff to \\"Prowler\\" is a great way to kick off the album. The song itself is an album highlight and one of my favourite Maiden tunes. It features a nice solo which I'm pretty sure was done by Denis. Maybe not a \\"masterpiece\\" in terms of lyrics compared to some of their stuff that would follow but this one always makes for a very enjoyable listen.<br /><br />After \\"Prowler\\" is finished wowing you, you're hit with one of the coolest riffs this side of cool. This turns out to be one of the more \\"punk\\" songs lyrically and might not be for the casual Maiden fan but I can never see myself skipping over it. \\"Sanctuary\\" is one hell of a song!<br /><br />\\"Remember Tomorrow\\" sort of reminds me of some of the later Maiden stuff with Bruce. Much like \\"Children of the Damned\\" this one starts off very soft and mellow (demonstrating that Paul can take on the ballad as well) but in the middle gets louder and a bit faster. I think this is a nice preview of things to come.<br /><br />Clive gives us a cool drum beat to start off this song. Steve quickly comes in with a nice, smooth bassline and \\"Running Free\\" begins. This song kind of goes back to the punk energy of \\"Sanctuary\\" with similar lyrics. I dare you to listen to this song and NOT get up, jump around and/or start to sing or hum along. This is a quick classic and Paul excels again on this track.<br /><br />\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a masterpiece all on its own. This may well be Maiden's first epic. If this were an album...I would buy it. This song is fast and then slow and then fast again. I find it funny how they can go from the very punkness of \\"Running Free\\" to the epic metal song that is \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". This is how a lot of people get into Maiden and even more of a sign of things to come.<br /><br />A quick riff starts this one off. \\"Transylvania\\" is a great piece of work and pinpoints each member's talent at one point in the song. While not as good as any of the instrumentals that Metallica would do in later years but still is a fast song that always makes for a fun listen.<br /><br />\\"Strange World\\" is sort of a mystical track. I think this kind of influenced some of the power metal bands that would come out in later years although no one else I talk to seems to get that. I guess I get that mainly from the lyrics and the overall vibe of this one. It's a pretty cool song.<br /><br />The Charlotte saga starts here with arguably the best out of the four songs (defiantly better then \\"Hooks in You\\" and \\"From here to Eternity\\"). Much like \\"Prowler\\" the lyrics aren't amazing but they are fun and this turns out to make a very serious series of songs.<br /><br />A very strange riff launches the next song and it soon turns into a harmony riff. The theme of this one is pretty much terror and death. It makes for a fast-paced yet still spooky listen. This is many a Maiden fan's favourite Paul-era song. Also Bruce does this one quite nicely live.<br /><br />Anyway as much as I love this album, I don't recommend you start here. If you start with this or  Killers you won't get the feel of what Iron Maiden really became. I'd start with  Number of the Beast or  Powerslave but don't count the Paul-era stuff out because it really does rock and it will kick you ass.hum along. This is a quick classic and Paul excels again on this track.  <br /> <br />\\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is a masterpiece all on its own. This may well be Maiden's first epic.

B00007G207|5.0|This review is for the 2003 Marimax \\"New Version\\" DVD.    The story deals with a successful film director whose childhood nickname was \\"Toto\\".  In a long flashback, he recalls his youthful days in a small Italian village in the mid-1940's.  Young Toto's father died in Russia during the war, so he would frequently take refuge in the local movie theater and immerse himself in each and every film shown.  He befriends the projectionist, a middle-aged man named Alfredo, and through fun and even tragedy, they become inseparable.  When Alfredo is no longer capable of being the projectionist, young Toto takes over.  As a teenager, Toto continues to work at the cinema, while falling in love with a beautiful girl named Elena.      The DVD contains two versions: the original 123-minute theater version and a 173 newly released director's cut.  The original version is absolutely incredible, while the newer, longer release is actually very average.  The difference between the two is that the longer version deals with Toto and Elena over many more years than what is shown in the original, and besides being too long, it kills the innocence and purity of the original film.      I've now watched the original about six times and it never grows old.  I watched the extended version once and never plan to again.  The original does a much better job staying focused on the funny moments as well as the heartwarming situations.  Furthermore, the original effectively concentrates on not only loving the cinema, and even more so, loving people in the purest way possible.  The new version fails miserably on the later.  The ending of either version reaches a brilliant and gripping crescendo as middle-aged Toto views a film that was given to him by Alfredo.  The musical score is also wonderful.    The DVD quality is excellent with stunning color and sharp focus.  A few short sequences seemed grainy, but it never seemed to be a major distraction.  The audio is excellent too.  Unfortunately, there were no extras on the DVD.      Original Movie: A+    New Version Movie: C+    DVD Quality: A
1402714580|1.0|Sure the story is great (as it would be with any version) and this version does have the nice print and book mark, however, the advertising suggested to me, at least, that there would be several illustrations.  There were none except silly chests with each little woman's name engraved on them at the start of each chapter. <br /> <br />Do not select this book if you are looking for an *illustrated* version.  The Illustrated Junior Library version is well illustrated and at least as high quality a printing. <br /> <br />By the way, read the sales copy above to see how misleading it is.  Just for that reason, consumers should eschew this version, and Amazon should have them change it.
B000BP86OG|5.0|...but i think that's just cause they were trying to go into a more queen/elo/meatloaf direction (in fact queen's producer helped produce this.) there is still some 80's vibes on a couple tracks, but this record is predominately 70's operatic. which is in my opinion a good thing. different from the first album to a certain degree, yet still very much the darkness. more sophisticated and radio friendly, but still classic.<br /><br />1.) One Way ticket To Hell-- this track seems to have the same riff as i believe in a thing called love at the begining of the chorus, which ensures its success since the former was a hit. isn't that what \\"ac/dc\\" does? the same thing over and over so the hits keep on flowing? yep.<br /><br />2.) Knockers-- most people think this is the best song on the album. i like it, but it's not my favorite. cute lyrics. something about the guitar melody in the chorous reminds me of 70's \\"aerosmith\\".<br /><br />3.) Is It Just Me?-- One of my favorite tracks! very 80's chorus and good lyrics. this song could've been big around '84, '85. around the time \\"van halen\\" were churning out hits like jump and panama, though this track doesn't particularily sound like those. it just has that fun happy 80's metal edge that reminds me of that time period.<br /><br />4.) Dinner Lady Arms-- justin's voice is in top form on the album, and this track definitely demonstrates that. the verses to this track have a very british new wave contemporary sound to them. lovely chorus!<br /><br />5.) Seemed Like Such A Good Idea At The Time-- beautiful ballad. interesting vocal arrangement. i would've liked to have heard a little more guitar work, but still quite lovely.<br /><br />6.) Hazel Eyes-- kind of sounds like if \\"the who\\" met \\"big country\\". 70's classic rock meets sweedish new wave. again, this is most people's fave track. not mine, but still i like the guitar riff.<br /><br />7.) Bald-- excellent track! everyone must admit this. reminds me of something from \\"the scorpions\\" era. good old fashioned power metal. silly lyrics, but it just goes to show with incredible vocals and an amazing song, the lyrics can be pure silliness and it doesn't damage the song at all.<br /><br />8.) Girlfriend-- i like this song a lot! very 70's rollar boogie. reminiscent of something \\"sweet\\" would've done.<br /><br />9.) English Country Garden-- excellent track! very meatloaf/queen inspired. once again is demonstrating the strong 70's flavor. clever lyrics as well.<br /><br />10.)Blind Man--very very obviously inspired by \\"Queen\\". very slow, but very lovely. and an interesting pick to close the album to.<br /><br />this c.d. is very fast paced, the songs flow into one another nicely, and the songs are wonderfully produced. i don't skip any tracks, which is a good sign cause i'm notorious for being a song shuffler. i smell a success. good job blokes!but it just goes to show with incredible vocals and an amazing song, the lyrics can be pure silliness and it doesn't damage the song at all.    8.)

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Warning: Contains Spoilers---For the past five years, our TV has been used 99% of the time to watch DVDs and play videogames. So of course I missed Firefly when it first aired. Thank god for Netflix! My husband and I rented the first disc and before I even returned it, we bought the boxed set. Because we knew this was it, no more Firefly after these four discs, we watched the rest of series sloooowly, one a week, savoring each episode. And when it was over, I felt satisfied (great last episode!)---yet empty. I NEED to know what's going to happen: Can Mal and Inara put aside their Elizabeth-and-Darcy act and get together? Will Zoe and Wash have a baby? (A baby on Serenity? Hmm, might work, might not.) Will Jayne be tempted to betray his shipmates again? Who exactly is Shepherd Book? Will Simon loosen up and will Kaylee be the one to help him do it? When will River stop crying?! And these are just the little questions! Ok, quite a few of these get answered in the movie, which is some consolation, but it's not enough. The cast, crew, and writers of Firefly deserve hour-long shows and plenty of them (well at least as many as, oh, Star Trek Next Gen): FOX, MAKE IT SO.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|Listen to his lyrics on \\"who did you think I was\\"? HE DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE SAME OLD STUFF ANYMORE! <br />Give him credit for that! He's doing what he wants to do now. This is what's wrong with the music industry and why music all sounds the same-because people freak out when someone changes their style and tries something that isn't necessarly different for themselves but different for their fans! You're lucky he is sharing this side of himself with you and making it about the music and not the money!    <br />As someone who has grown up on Stevie Ray Vaughn and Hendrix and as someone who has always loved John Mayer I really appreciate this cd. Of course it's not going to sound exactly like his influences because it is still John Mayer. <br />For a live cd it sounds very good. It's not over-produced like a lot of the other music that is out there.  <br />Listen to it with an open mind and give it a chance.. it's not going to be what you expect! appreciate it for that!
B000002H33|5.0|This is perhaps the second or third greatest heavy metal album of all time!  Hands down, the best Metallica album of all time!  Perfection!  Every f*cking song is a gem.  Jaymz & The Metalifux kick out all the stops and go for broke.  Battery, The Thing That Should Not Be, Damage Inc.  Welcome Home (Sanitarium) is a favorite as is the title track.  Not a bad song on here, even the instrumental Orion is f*cking hella-cool.  Rocks on every level and then some.  This is the one that turned them into rock legends. Truly a visionary recording.  Ten steps above the rest.  Saw them on the Master Of Puppets tour in March of 1986, opening for Ozzy.  They f*cking rocked Ozzy off the stage! Farewell to Cliff Burton.  Here is where the honesty that was Metallica was in it's final, flawless state.  After Master, and then Justice, the wheels started to come off a little tweak at a time.<br /><br />Dig It!
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I am not a great reviewer in terms of coming up with a lot of descriptive words.....but I do consider myself a good judge of music (who doesn't right?).  This is one of the best new CDs I have bought in recent memory.  The live sound quality is great with an crisp edge and an awesome low end / bass response.  Great jam band sounds on some songs, great blues sound on some songs, and some great just regular rock on others.   <br /> <br />Gotta try TRY!!!!!!!!!
B000002H6C|5.0|With the untimely and tragic death of Cliff Burton, Metallica took some time off and reflected before choosing upon Flotsam & Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted to take Cliff's spot.  What ensued from there was an EP of garage band covers called Garage Days Re-Revisited and then the real studio effort of ...And Justice For All.  Well...the Metalifux, with Jason New-kid seemed to click and the result was a double album (back in the days when they still had them) with smashing, bone-crushing, solo-ladden manical flights of fancy ala Metallica.  Jaymez seemed in rare form on this album and some of the songs were quite lengthy.  Lars drum sound on this album was the heaviest I've ever heard.  Blackened, Shortest Straw, Harvester Of Sorrow & Dyer's Ever are among the standouts.  One is on here, of couse, which launched the MTV Metallica career.  Great album, up there with Master Of Puppets, but not as entirely perfect.
B000002GQJ|5.0|I think this album is the Moody Blues' most complete effort. Every song is good. Some of their other albums also have great individual songs, but this album is winner from beginning to end. Actually, I created a \\"best of\\" compilation on my computer and it included this entire album plus several individual cuts from many of the other M.B. albums...I just couldn't think of any of the songs on this album to leave off of my personal Moody Blues favorites collection. Love this album and it just never gets old or outdated. \\"Melancholy Man\\" is another \\"Nights in White Satin\\"  (well not quite, but a great, great song). \\"The Question\\" is outstanding too...can't go wrong with this one....
B0000025K9|5.0|This is it!  If you can't understand that this is the greatest heavy metal album of all time, then you just don't understand the entire concept of metal.  Since Ozzy pretty much helped to invent heavy metal with Black Sabbath, it is only fitting that he inherit the claim to the it's most superior album.  Randy Rhoads make this album perfect.  Rhoads is God here.  Don't believe me?  Listen to those licks!  Jesus!  He was a monster!  Crazy Train, I Don't Know, Mr. Crowley, Suicide Solution, Revelation (Mother Earth)....every track is a certified classic.  Un-f*cking-believable!  Listen and learn!<br /><br />Dig It!
B00005JO1J|4.0|I will admit first off that I am not a Rent-o-phile. I have never seen the musical although I do know that the musical, now entering its tenth season on Broadway, has had more guest performers than the entire run of the Love Boat. I know it is supposed to be based on the play/book La Boheme, which I know nothing about. I also know the creator, Jonathon Larson, died before the show hit Broadway. I also know the show won a Pulitzer for best drama, and a slew of 1996 Tony Awards. During the 1996-1997 Broadway season, I saw another innovative show that critics loved--Bring in Da Noise, Bring in Da Funk. From the Broadway: The American Musical compilation CD, I knew the popular song Season of Life from Rent. However, I didn't discover that until winter 2004. Needless to say, I went into the movie not knowing much about the plot of the show, but looking to be entertained and not disappointed by the film adaptation.<br /><br />I was not disappointed with Rent...the movie although it was directed by Chris Columbus (who ruined Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets for me). Out of four stars, I give it three solid stars. However, I should delve into the flaws before I heap on the praise. That would only be fair.<br /><br />Rent is a time capsule of a New York City that no longer exists. As a matter of fact, the NYC that Rent takes place in didn't even exist when the show hit Broadway. In 1995, AIDS was no longer a death sentence and phrases like \\"living with AIDS\\" were the norm. AZT was replaced with Protease Inhibitors. The heart of NYC bohemia, SoHo and Greenwich Village, became filled with Yuppies who were the only ones able to afford the soaring rents (no pun intended).<br /><br />In the Giuliani era of NYC, Times Square and 42nd Street was cleaned of its charm. The hookers, the homeless (Squeegee Men), and drug addicts had been bulldozed out of sight by the corporate sponsors and family entertainment. Even the gays and lesbians seemed less threatening as they became more and more a marketing niche as opposed to a hated and disenfranchised population. And ironically enough, Rent came to Broadway stage at a time when Broadway was starting to sell out its soul to Disney, Hollywood actors (no offense Hugh Jackman), and musical tracks instead of real life musicians.<br /><br />Rent was dated when it became a hit, but somehow it works. It works on stage and works on the screen. As a native New Yorker who remembers dirty streets, crack heads, graffiti-ed subways, and the squatters and tent cities in Tompkins Square Park, Rent is a beautiful reminder that New York is good even when it is really bad. It's full of youthful ambition and a will to succeed even when the odds are stacked against you. Death, sickness, poverty, and hunger are the prices one must pay to live out their dreams. Rent is about fulfilling dreams when everything works against you. It's also, as the Seasons of Life eludes, about love and living for only today.<br /><br />Except for the lesbian lawyer Joanne, played by Tracie Thomas, and erotic dancer Mimi, played by a feline sexy Rosario Dawson, everyone in the movie are holdovers from the original stage production. Some critics say that they are too old to be playing characters that are at least 10 years younger. I don't hold their age against them--is there a time limit on optimism, ambition, dreams? You'll recognize Jesse L. Martin from his stint on Law and Order; Taye Diggs from How Stella Got Her Groove Back; and Diggs' wife, Idina Menzel from her Tony-award winning stint in Broadway's Wicked.<br /><br />I was wholly moved by the plot, the acting, the singing, and of the NYC of long ago. I sat until the end of the credits singing along until finally the lights came up. I knew in my heart that I would be buying the original Broadway soundtrack and movie soundtrack and the DVD when it came out. I hope the movie gets an Oscar nod for best picture, best movie score, and that Rosario Dawson getsan Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.<br /><br />Rent! You gotta see it!osario Dawson gets an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress.  <br /> <br />Rent! You gotta see it!
B00000DS9H|4.0|After the mental-fart that was 1986's The Ultimate Sin, Ozzy said goodbye to Jake E. Lee and came up with a replacement by the name of Zakk Wylde.  (By the way, who the f*ck in the Ozzy camp comes up with these terrible monikers?  A monkey on peyote?)  Anyway, Zakk is young and wylde and you can totally hear that he is a Randy Rhoads freak and a Black Sabbath nut to boot.  Well....he absolutely shreds and Ozzy seems supremely happy with himself.  Perhaps he has found Randy Rhoads reincarnated here.  Maybe.  Anything would have sounded good after the tripe that was The Ultimate Sin, but No Rest is more than that.  It is a ressurrection in a way.  Ozzy soundz more sure of himself again and Zakk is the guitarist that Ozzy didn't have with Brad Gillis or Jake.  The songs wail all over the place and Zakk's riffs and licks are electrifying.  Miracle Man is sorta annoying but still catchy.  Devil's Daughter rox as does Demon Alcohol and Fire In The Sky.  The true gem is Bloodbath In Paradise, an ode to Charlie Manson and California murder.  One untitle track at the end of the CD.  All in all a very solid effort.  The one lame track would have to be tattoed dancer (Dance for me, bitch?) just doesn't seem like Ozzy being honest with himself or his fans.  Otherwise, pretty flawless.  Bob Daisley returns to write the lyrics and the melodies with the Ozzman.  Geezer Butler will take his place on the road.  The late Randy Castillo's second studio recording with Ozzy on drums.<br /><br />Dig it!
B00000DQSS|5.0|In the original liner notes for the record (sadly not reproduced here), Kate Bush thanks Peter Gabriel for \\"opening the windows,\\" a prophetic thank you considerring that 6 years later she would sing on Gabriels' \\"So\\" on \\"Don't Give Up.\\" The sound of this Cd compared to earlier efforts by Bush certainly shows her welcoming Gabriel's 'open windows' of inspiration.<br /><br />I was tempted to give this a 4 because of the production sound and missing liner notes. The sound is a bit thin and deserves a remasterring from the original tapes. I'm glad to see it released on CD, but it needs a good production wizard to \\"open the windows\\" of the work. Classic case of vinyl transfer not quite measuring up in CD form.<br /><br />Nevertheless, 'Never For Ever\\" stands as an intellectual, progressive album with multi-dimensional and multi-sonic realms. I give it a 5 based on the music, which is the main point of releasing a CD.<br /><br />Notable tracks: Babooshka, Delius, All We Ever Look For, Egypt, The Wedding List.<br /><br />I wore out all three copies of my vinyl versions of this masterpiece by 1988.<br /><br />Please, someone remaster this work of art!
B000002B7O|5.0|Being a how Randy Rhoads and Ozzy would only collaborate on two studio albums before Rhoads tragic and untimely demise, it seems fitting that Diary Of A Madman be Randy's swan song.  Steeped in accoustical genius and dark overtones, Diary is more revolutionary than its predecessor Blizzard Of Ozz in that the compositions are more complicated.  Since both albums were recorded at the very same time, this is slightly strange.  Randy was never happy with the final product because the album was pushed up and out to catch the popularity of Blizzard and he was never able to go back and fix things that he wanted to.  Some of the solos on Diary were dummy solos to Randy.  Incredible.  Still in the top ten of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time, Diary is a little bit off the track and not as cleanly perfect as Blizzard was.  Still flawless in execution.  Over The Mountain, Flying High Again, You Can't Kill rock And Roll & Little Dolls as well as the title track and Believer!  Standout Ozzy classics.  Randy is God and he shows why here.
B00005MP58|5.0|I recently saw the new 2005 version of P&P with Keira Knightley, as well as this mini-series from 1995 with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.   <br /> <br />I absolutely love the story.  The new version leaves a lot out as it primarily focuses on Keria Knightley.  The mini-series is 300 minutes long and develops all of the other characters.  The fact that the mini-series is older does not hurt its quality.  The actors are exceptional. <br /> <br />This DVD was selling as #35 on Amazon's best sellers when I wrote this review.
B000002B7S|5.0|The first studio album following Randy Rhoads' tragic death.  We find Ozzy a little confused at what he's doing, but otherwise slightly coherent.  Enter San Diego wunderpunk Jake E. Lee on guitar, original Blizzard bassist Bob Daisley, Blizzard keyboardist Don Airey, and drummer Tommy Aldridge's first appearance on an Ozzy studio effort.  The song selection is a bit schitzophrenic in its array going from the bone-crunching Bark At The moon into the depressed defiance of You're No Different to the tongue in cheek (literrally) sexual innuendos of Now You See It, Now You Don't then back to the staight metal of Rock & Roll Rebel.  That was side one as the licorice pizzas used to turn.  Side two was equally strange with the monks-in-mourning opening of Center Of Eternity, to the blazing boredom of So Tired, the filler-mediocrity of Slow Down and the final brilliance of Waiting For Darkness.  A very topsy-turvy outing by Ozzy, but quite understandable.  Less than a year after losing his best friend in a freak plane accident.  Booze and dope and his new marriage to Sharon.  There are mixed emotions in Ozzy's life and in his work as well.  Jake E. Lee is solid, though overshadowed by the brilliance of Rhoads, and he will have to live with that for quite some time.  Fans curse him with banners as if he purposely whacked Randy in order to break into the Ozzy clubhouse.  Still a favorite of mine, reminds me of what it was like to be thirteen years old and totally into the madman of rock and roll.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This album is the best of the two albums released by System of a Down this year. But many people will find it hard to adapt to the new cd for they wont be finding any thing radio-friendly on this album. Hypnotize is an intense album with alot of emotion. The story of this album would have to be the lyrics.  <br /> <br />The lyrics this time around are MUCH better than mezmerize. Lets look at Radio/Video lyrics from Mezmerize compared to Soldiers Side of Hypnotize. <br /> <br />Radio Video- <br /> <br />Hey man look at me rockin' out <br />I'm on the radio <br />Hey man look at me rockin' out <br />I'm on the video <br /> <br />Hey man look at me rockin' out <br />I'm on the radio <br />Hey man look at me rockin' out <br />I'm on the video with Danny and Lisa <br /> <br />They take me away from <br />The strangest places <br />Sweet Danny and Lisa <br />They take me away from <br /> <br />This is the whole song. You want to know why people will like Mezmerize better than Hypnotize, its because System of a Down intended it to be. They wanted to show they can release something that sounds great for radio fans and release something like THIS for System of a Down Fans. <br /> <br />Soldier Side- <br /> <br />Dead men lying on the heart of the grave  <br />Wondering when savior comes, if he is gonna be saved  <br />Maybe you're a sinner and to your turn in life  <br />Maybe you're a joker, maybe you deserve to die  <br /> <br />They were crying when their sons left  <br />God is wearing black  <br />He's gone so far to find no hope  <br />He's never coming back  <br /> <br />They were crying when their sons left  <br />All your men must go  <br />He's come so far to find no truth  <br />He's never going home  <br /> <br />Young men standing on the top of their own grave  <br />Wondering when Jesus comes, are they gonna be saved  <br />Holy to the little bishop, tells the king his lies  <br />Maybe you're a mourner, maybe you deserve to die  <br /> <br />Welcome to the soldier side  <br />Where there is no one here but me  <br />People all grow up to die  <br />There is no one here but me  <br /> <br />Welcome to the soldier side  <br />There is no one here but me  <br />People on the soldier side  <br />There is no one here but me  <br /> <br />That is the complete song. Much longer and much more powerful than anything of in Mezmerize. You might get the hint that i dont like Mezmerize, but that is not true. I like Mezmerize and i admit its a good album but this is CLASSIC System of a Down at their best. <br /> <br />Attack- 10/10 strong musical with catchy choruses <br /> <br />Dreaming 10/10 great melody and one of the best of the album <br /> <br />Kill Rock and Roll- 10/10 A highly catchy song. The chorus is real funny and the music is really fast and changes pace alot. <br /> <br />Hypnotize-10/10 The first single of the album. If anyone hasn't heard this song it must be some were in mars. For this is as close to mezmerize as you will get in this album. The only song, in my view, that has a Radio Feel. Good song. <br /> <br />Stealing Society- 9/10 The intro starts of with Daron's heavy riff and ends with it too. The chorus is good and Darons vocals along with Serj make this song some how work. <br /> <br />Tentative- 10/10 Probably the most emotional song of the album other than Soldier Side. Its track 6 of Hypnotize and Chop Suey was Track 6 of Toxicity. It has a Chop Suey feel but with powerful lyrics. You can tell Serj really put alot into making this song work. The line-\\"Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall\\" demonstrates Systems strong view of anti war. Great song. One of System's best. <br /> <br />U-Fig- 10/10. Eat Eat Eat Eat Eat Eat em. The catchy U-Fig is a song of Melody and change of pace and movement. The Chorus is one of the catchies of the album. Its great and doesnt let up.  <br /> <br />Holy Mountain- 10/10 Track 8. Well here is track 8 and this one has a lot to live up to especially after Questionsbeing track 8 on Mezmerize and ATWA being Track 8 of Toxicity. Before i heard this song of the album i had already heard live of the main website. I LOVED IT. I thought to myself how can the original version be any better than this. It was. Violins and the way Rick Rubin produced it is so wonderfully epic. This is one of their best of all time. Songs like these is what makes System of a Down the best going band going today. <br /> <br />Vicinity of Obscenity- 10/10 Usually after System puts on an Epic song they release a funny song after it. This is the most wierdest, funniest, catchiest system of a Down song to date. I got one word for you all, Bannanna. <br /> <br />Shes like Heroin 9/10 The weakest song of the album. I like the lyrics to the song but i wouldve put serj to sing the whole song other than Daron.  <br /> <br />Lonely Day- 10/10 The lost in Hollywood of Hypnotize. This is a great acoustic song with a powerful Solo. I love the lyrics, music, and emotion Daron puts into making this song work.  Again Lyrics and Music wise are awesome here. The ending is so great because it leads us to Soldiers Side. <br /> <br />Soldier Side-10/10 The most emotional song of their career. They put it in the Mezmerize track as an intro and they had a lot to live up to. I had a lot of expectations for this song. The lyrics and melody and the EMOTION put into this song makes the song nothing short of an epic.  <br /> <br />Overall- An epic album. One of the best they have ever released if not the best. I love the whole album from start to finish. So when you put Mezmerize and Hypnotize what do you get, the best damn double album ever released.  <br /> <br />Possible  Upcoming Singles: <br /> <br />Kill Rock and Roll <br />Holy Mountain <br />Soldier Side <br />Lonely Day <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002B7U|3.0|In the middle '80s, there was a thing called hair-metal and in the midst of that movement with bands like Poison and Motley Crue and Cinderella and Warrant and blah-de-blah-blah Ozzy lost his f*cking mind and started to think that maybe he could get away with being a glam rocker too.  The song on this disc all have that \\"Hey, I collaborated with some Hollywood song-mechanic hotshot sound\\" as if the likes of Desmond Child or some other song doctor had jumped in bed with Ozzy to create a new sound that wasn't Ozzy and wasn't very f*cking metal.  This is Ozzy-lite!  This is the disgrace of chick-minded-metal.  This is a fad.  Well, you can tell that it won't last long.  The saving grace of The Ultimate Sin Tour '86 was that Ozzy recruited some underground metalheads to open for him by the name of Metallica, and they were supporting a little album at the time by the name of Master Of Puppets.  What a great show & a fond farewell to Cliff Burton at the end of the tour.  The Ultimate Sin, Shot In The Dark and probably Lightning Strikes are the listenable cuts, everything else just sounds like Dokken and I wasn't really into them.  Bummer that Jake E. Lee's exit would be marred by suck mediocre work.  Would have been interesting if Ozzy had stuck with the metal.
0316666343|4.0|Have you ever imagined how life might be in heaven? Many of us imagine graceful angels, rivers flowing with milk and honey and peace. In the luminous novel, The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold, the narrator Susie Salmon is already in heaven.  Murdered tragically by a neighbor when she was just fourteen years old, Susie tells us what it's like in heaven. \\"When I first entered heaven I thought everyone saw what I saw. That in everyone's heaven there were soccer goalposts in the distance and lumbering women throwing shot put and javelin. That all the buildings were like suburban northeast high schools built in the 1960s.\\" Later she learns that heaven is whatever you truly want it to be.  As Susie gets used to living in heaven, she watches her family and friends on Earth come to terms with the realization that she is gone forever. This book grabs the reader into the novel with the dramatic, shocking first few sentences,\\" My name was Salmon, like the fish; first name Susie. I was fourteen when I was murdered on December 6, 1973.\\" In the novel, Sebold brilliantly uses the character of Susie to challenge our perspective on death and most importantly, life after death.   The heart of the story lies when her family and friends begin to heal the wounds of her death. She's there when her father comes to realize that the immortality that should of come from having three children is not there anymore.  Meanwhile, Susie keeps watching, hoping that they can feel her there, in spirit and that a little bit at a time they can go back to the way their family was before the murder.  Given the age and what happened to the narrator, you might expect a sad, angry or bitter teenage girl.  But Sebold surprises us with a character full of curiosity, maturity and hope about the people still on earth. Of course, she occasionally becomes upset because of the events going on with her classmates who are doing things she never will, but her real regret isn't for herself; it is for the members of herfamily and friends who are left to piece the puzzle pieces together and make sense of it all.  The Lovely Bones is about Susie watching her family and friends heal and regain their strong relationship.  It is about the restoration of a family after it is devastated.   The images and feelings that Sebold sets up through the events in the novel are nevertheless truly unforgettable. I am not normally one to get emotional and vulnerable, so reading in public has never been a big deal. I was somewhere in the middle of the novel while waiting in a dentist's office and I got so into my reading that I hadn't realized a hour had passed by. (Had they already called my name?)  I was glad, though, that no one was there to see me wipe away my joyous tears.  There are a myriad of scenes that stand out to me, but a truly heartwarming and touching moment occured when Lindsay, the younger sister of Susie,  attempts to shave her legs for the first time. Her father, instead of her mother steps in and helps by giving her a new blade and telling her what to do, against the typical father role. He keeps it to himself that he feels she's too young to shave her legs. Like various moments throughout the novel,  it touches the heart and is a step in the grieving process of Susie's death.  Another way the novel surprised me was in the flow of the story, which is very unique.  Susie narrarates by blending in events about things that happened before she died so that we can see how the family was when she was still there; and at the same time, she keeps the day to day, year to year events moving along, so that we can see the progress the family has made toward recovery.  The ending is poetic and beautiful. Yes, it is somewhat predictable, but nevertheless leaves you with a pleasant smile on your face. After the novel is read, it's like what Susie says about both herself and her family, sometimes she goes away to watch her family because she just can't help it, and sometimes they think of her because they can't help it as well. That is how I feel towards the novel, I think about the messages and themes because I can't help it either.  Overall, Sebold takes a horrifying tragedy and sheds some light on the event turning it into something that helps the characters grow and thrive. With drama, suspense and even humor, she brings healthy insight into the role that death plays in our lives and how we must remember that although they may not be there physically, they certainly are in spirit.  So, will the murderer be caught and sent to jail? Or will he be get away with the crime he committed? This novel will have you on your feet eagerly wanting to turn the page.  Penelope, San Francisco
B000002LCE|3.0|Those people who thought or think that Dream Evil is really good Dio are either too young to understand Dio or not big enough fans to realize mediocrity when they hear it.  Now...Vivian Cambell is gone and Craig Goldie is brought on board.  Ressurected from Dio's pet project Rough Cutt the San Diego kid is way too much of a Blackmore freak and way too mezmerised by Dio's presence (don't get me wrong, I think Goldie is a pretty good f*cking gutar player).  The lyrics are thin and slightly dull-witted and the guitar solos are strained.  There is an element of passion on Dream Evil that is not even hinted at.  By this album, Dio seems to be on auto-pilot, believing his own hype and regurgitating the same old sorcery and voodoo elements.  But...and this is a big one, it is still listenable.  Weird.  Even Dio's most uninspired tripe is still a good turn now and then.  Not completely awful as it could have been, Dream evil just seems like Dio-lite.  The margerine of Dio.  The Dio that should not be.  Call it what you will.  I you think Dream Evil is a top-notch Dio effort, then...you just don't get it.<br /><br />Dig it!
B000B8QEYC|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Enya and love everything she has ever produced in the past twenty or so years. She's enormously talented and along with the Ryans, she has gone on to create some of the most memorable and beautiful music anywhere. <br /> <br />However, after purchasing and listening to Amarantine shortly after seeing a TV commercial for the album, I must say I am rather disappointed. Sure, this has the same great Enya, same great melodies, and same great choirs, but so what? <br /> <br />Enya's first few albums were unique and special, unlike most anything before them, but this album is almost exactly like her past two or so efforts. It gets tiresome to hear the same chord progressions, same types of melodies, same choirs, same orchestral strings, and just about everything else the same from the past. While this may still be relaxing and enjoyable, as a fan I was looking for something new: a territory that she has not yet covered. Alas, that's where this album falls flat on its face. <br /> <br />I will probably be scolded for this review, but Enya has simply become boring to me. I never thought I'd say that about her as I really love her previous work, but this new album, even after five years, is almost exactly like the previous album. Perhaps it was rushed to fulfill a contract? Perhaps these songs were leftovers from the previous sessions? I don't know the answer, but I'd hate to think that Enya's innovative years are past.
B000002L7V|4.0|I think the first thing you notice from Sacred Heart is that Vivian Campbell is no longer happy being under the thumb of Ronnie James Dio.  Learning from such superior pricks as Blackmore and Iommi, Ronnie has become a miniature megalomaniac himself and since the band bears his name and no one else's he makes the rules.  This might have been hard for the individuals that made up Dio (the band) to digest and you can hear it in the 3rd Dio effort.  Magic and mystical overtones abound and are starting to wear a little thin.  Still listenable but not the gut-punch Dio of the previous two albums.  Seeing Dio twice in '85 on the Sacred Heart Tour (Once with Campbell and once with Goldie on guitar)you could see that Vivian and Dio were through.  He looked nearly dead on stage.  This was where Dio's stage show had started to get ridiculous too, with the knights spitting lasers and the big fake-ass looking dragon that Ronnie fought with a lightsabre.  Wow!  Was this metal or friggin' Disney on Ice?  Ronnie may have been listening to his wife Wendy way too much, because he was starting to become a cliche.  Sacred Heart is the beginning of the decline for Dio that would last for decades to come....
B000AMJDHY|1.0|OMG! <br />I wouldn't even give this album a one! <br />I can't believe that people are actually hailing this band as doing something new...the shear stupidity of claiming such a thing makes me fear for humanity! <br />These sound even worse than most of the pathetic emo bands out there! <br />I wouldn't dare call this music \\"dance/rock\\", it's just souless, kiddy pop. <br /> <br />And if you want truly new and experimental dance/rock...then i'd stick with Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Arcade Fire, Franz Ferdinand type bands who could wipe the floor several times with this band. <br />Leave it to these bands who truly know how to create a fresh sound with exciting beats and catchy lyrics.
B000002L61|5.0|After a classic like Holy Diver, how could you come up with an album as awesome?  Well...Dio came very close with his second album The Last In Line.  Very metal!  Vivian is still wailing and Ronnie is still in peak form and aside from a few soft spots, this album has classic metal written all over it.  We Rock, The Last In Line, One Night In The City, I Speed At Night, Breathless, Eat Your Heart Out & Egypt (The Chains Are On) all rock on every level.  Mystery is a little too reminiscent of Rainbow In The Dark & Evil Eyes is the Diet Coke of Metal (Just one calorie, not metal enough!)  Still a stellar effort!  I saw Dio in '84 on the Last In Line tour in San Diego from the front row and I gotta tell you it was AWESOME!  Still one of my favorite albums of all time!<br /><br />Dig it!
B00005JLR8|5.0|An Irish family moves illegally to New York to escape the tragedy of losing Frankie, their only son. Once you know that the character of Frankie was based on, and dedicated to, the Director's late brother, it becomes all the more poignant. Christy and Ariel, the couples two remaining children, are sisters in real life, and treat each other with an amazing tenderness in the movie. The acting that the children do is incredible. <br /> <br />This is a movie about carrying on despite being in the darkest place you've ever been in. These characters don't HAVE a choice, they must keep breathing, must find jobs, must comfort each other. <br /> <br />I adored this movie. It was very sad, but so is life sometimes.
B00005K9LK|5.0|Arguably one of the greatest Heavy Metal albums of all time.  Certainly on my personal Top Ten List.  This is Judas Priest at the height of their metallic granduer!  Electric Eye, Screaming For Vengeance, You've Got Another Thing Comin' & Devil's Child absolutely f*cking rock!  Halford at his ear-splitting best!  You love Priest, you love this album.  You never heard Priest, start here!  Awesome!<br /><br />Dig It!
B0002DB52M|5.0|I've gone back and forth between thinking that this film is incredibly sick and incredibly brilliant. I still can't make up my mind, so all I can say is that is the most unique film I have ever seen: a very sick and amazing film, showing the darkness of the human heart when there are no rules to protect its victim. It starts out very slow, but gets good after 30 minutes (it is nearly 3 hours long). The violence of this film surpasses Pulp Fiction, but in a much more subtle way (if I was to say any more I would give the whole film away). The symbolism is worthy of analysis...a film student could write for days about what they see in this film...and afterwards, your mind will be racing and trying to make sense of it all. This is, in my opinion, the best work Nicole Kidman has ever done.  <br />
B000002B82|4.0|If one had to compare albums by Ozzy from one to the other, I would have to say that No More Tears is the technically-supperior bastard son of The Ultimate Sin.  The only thing that saves No More Tears from reaching that level of hypocrisy is that it has Zakk Wylde on it.  And something about Zakk and his love of playing guitar keeps the monsters under the bed and the boogeymen in the closet.  No More Tears was mostly co-written with non-Ozzy personnel.  Lemmy from Motorhead helped the Ozzman out on a few tunes (in fact there were two versions of the song Hellraiser, the Ozzy version and the Lemmy version.  Wow!  Yawn!)  Overall, this is a solid Ozzy outing, don't get me wrong, it's just tainted around the edges by too many fingers is all.  Ozzy is best when it's just him and the band writing their own sh*t.  Face it.  Otherwise can it truly be considered Ozzy?  Not really.  Anyway.  There are a few standouts here.  Mama, I'm Coming Home.  Zombie Stomp.  Mr. Tinkertrain is very creepy in the way that Ozzy soundz like a child-molester.  And of course, the title track, No More Tears.  Very polished album.  Very structured.  Just not Ozzy's best work, or most honest.<br /><br />Dig It!
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I adored this movie, even though I sat down to watch it thinking, \\"Oh no, it is bound to be crap.\\" Alice Ayers aka Natalie Portman is a young American, freshly arrived in London (such a cliche but whatever), that wins the heart of Dan aka Jude Law, and then spends the next 3 years of her life suffering miserably because of that. Julie Roberts character, Anna, has an affair with Dan, and even though she ends up marrying Larry aka Clive Owens, she continues her affair. Both couples cheat on each other with the other's partner, everyone suffers and is miserable about it, and since we have all suffered for love before, I adored this film. It was so unHollywood, so raw.
B00005JOHI|3.0|I realize that time constraints often pose limits on screen writers but my disppointment with this film was not based on what was left out so much as what was put in. <br /> <br />As others have expressed before me, the slovenly lifestyle of the Bennets portrayed in this version was a bit of a shock.  The Bennets were not well-to-do, but were comfortable in the book.  Even if those who produced this film thought it necessary to contrast the comparative wealth of Mr. Darcy with the Bennet's lack thereof, there was no need to equate poverty with mess, filth and general lack of attention to cleanliness. <br /> <br />The dialogue of the screen writer clashed with the lines adapted from Jane Austen's work.  Elegant phrasing was painfully coupled with modern casual verbage. <br /> <br />The characterization of Elizabeth and Jane Bennet should have stood in sharp contrast to those of their sisters and parents.  There was very little distinction between them. <br /> <br />Elizabeth was often rude in her behaviors to others rather than spirited and witty.  She was hateful to her mother, aggressively invading Mr. Darcy's space when angry, and generally childish. <br /> <br />Mr. Darcy seemed to be more an advertisement for the need of antidepressants than an attitude adjustment. <br /> <br />Charlotte Lucas was desperate rather than practical. <br /> <br />The comedy that should have been there in Lady Catherine, and Mr Collins was sadly lacking. <br /> <br />On the plus side though, I did enjoy how the relationship between Mr. and Mrs. Bennet was portrayed with greater warmth than previous versions.  I saw them as much more sympathetic characters. <br /> <br />I also thought the scene of Darcy and Elizabeth's awkwardness at their first meeting at his home was also well done. <br /> <br />The music and scenery were both lovely.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a strange movie, and it made me painfully aware of my own inherent geekiness (I remember fixing my hair like Deb's, way back in the 80s...).  But I still liked it...I think.
0553801503|3.0|Alright, we've heard plenty of excuses for this book.  We've heard it's half a book, we've heard the publishers demanded a smaller one, we've heard that we were gifted this one because the next book was supposed to take place 5 yrs later - and I say the only reason anyone has accepted these excuses after waiting 5+ years since the last one is because this is simply the best epic fantasy series ever written . I must say that A Feast for Crows is a yawn in the company of the three previous installments, but it is still better than 85% of the other fantasy trash out there. My biggest beef with the author is that in my opinion all of the characters covered this time were the least interesting . That is why I believe the next book will be really, really good because it will have all of the most interesting characters in it. I will not wait another 5 years though. I don't mean to appear negative, this is really great stuff, the best in my opinion. My advice is : READ THIS BOOK!! because it is only a small part of a brilliant work that demands to be enjoyed.
0307276902|5.0|I finished this book in 2 short days.  I just couldn't put it down!  Frey's writing style, using only periods gives a flow to the book similar to an addict's thought process.  Although some of the book is repetitive, Frey did this to give the reader a feeling of the redundancy of rehab.  It is a brilliant protrayal of his struggle and survival that could play a nice hand in dissuading teenagers from drugs and alcohol.
0151008787|3.0|This book is good and if you want a long drawn out, often over-detailed story about a family legacy from Europe to Israel and their trials and trevails, then this is good. If you get bored easily, you will be bored really easily with this one. Nonetheless, Oz writes beautifully and passionately and creates vivid images and scenes with his writing... the book is worth trying, but know, its Ok if you don't make it and run out of patience
0553275976|4.0|Many will remember the movie made of this.  My advice?  Don't.  I was put off this book for quite some time because of having seen the film, but, finally decided to give it a go (despite having a paperbackl edition with the film characters on the cover...) This book is an example of what a meticulous, fearless and talented writer of prose can come up with in response to the world around him. While being a great 'page-turner' as far as plot goes, Wolfe manages, through a complex web of ironies and double ironies, to examine humanity as a social creature in a certain time and place. Hands down one of the most enteratining novels that I have ever read, and definitely the best rendering of modern New York City in fiction! This paperback was so ubiquitous I waited 10 years to reluctantly read it, and only because it was one of the only books on the shelf where I was staying. Boy, was I rewarded with this compulsively readable, suspenseful, razor-sharp story. For social satire to be so fiendishly plotted is a real treat and this story will have you racing to its inexorable conclusion.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album is far more mature then the other albums previously released by John Mayer. Along with Pino and Steve, John has produced a sound that is somewhat old school and a lot more raw. His original songs, (`good love is on the way` is my particular favorite) step up his game. If you want Mr. your body is a wonderland, you are probably looking in the wrong place. It is different, it is unique, it is guitar playing at it`s finest, it is a risk he has taken and risk that seems to have paid off. Personally, I could do with never hearing `Daughters` again, but his revamp of it makes it almost like a new tune. A lot of people have talked about how this album may not reach the throngs of pop music fans which have made John so famous, but I believe this CD will make him even more famous then he already is. He is now getting past the screaming girls that consume his fan base and reaching out to those guys with guitar dreams and singing music the older generations can appreciate. He is bringing back the blues. Go into listening to this CD with an open mind and I am pretty sure you will come out bopping your head to at least a few of the tunes.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|I like Diana Kroll but, I bought this CD to have another opportunity to hear The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. CHJO is the best big band out there!
B000B7HZXM|1.0|no more please. This is another album, another piece of junk. Why do we even listen to this gunk. No way. I wont fall for it anymore.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|The purpose of this CD is to not only entertain lovers of traditional Christmas Song Classics but to also allow Mariah to light up your holiday with the joy of her \\"blessed vocal talents\\"...Haters, say what you want to say about Mariah but the truth is that she is a vision of love: Beautiful, talentive, smart....This re-release of a Christmas classic is just a reminder that Mariah Still Rules in a musical world of imperfection. You Go Girl! :-)
B000BJS4OY|5.0|What is it with some people commenting on Sony and their copy protected CDs, and Bruce's politics, and then using that to rate this release? Nothing! Rate it on the music. Not the man, not the politics and not Sony. Those comments don't belong here. Rate the release.<br /><br />Some people have commented on song selection. Well, there's not much choice in song selection when you're releasing a 30th anniversary re-release of an album. You're kind of stuck with the son choice. ;)<br /><br />As for Sony, well... just don't buy anything from them. But don't get on here and rate something down because you have something against Sony.<br /><br />As for the politics, well... that poster would have to be Republican. Get over it! Republicans certainly were petty in the senate recently when they knocked back acknowledging Bruce's career. They are probably still bitter about Bruce's support of Kerry, or maybe still holding on to him not allowing them to use Born in the USA during the Reagan years. Get over it! Bruce for the Senate!!!<br /><br />As for the music, yes, I am going to rate it. This is a true masterpiece. Nothing more to say than that, but give it 5 stars.
B000028U0Y|4.0|I'm sorry for insulting Johnny Cash, even without listening to the album. Maybe you can say i'm biased..because i might not like him in person..but i guess i shouldn't let that affect my review of this album. <br /> <br />This album is really awesome..i recommend it to any Country or Pop lovers..thanks M. Sallee for clearing up my mind. Hope you can see my review and accepted my childish apology. <br /> <br />I recommend Carrie underwood's Some Hearts together with this. they will make a perfect match in your two-disc player set.
B00005JMXX|1.0|How anyone can spend 125 million dollars on this load of rubbish is amazing. Apart from the special effects (which are only so-so) the whole movie is just one long string of boring cliches plundered from penny dreadfuls and your everyday soaps. Global warming (whether or not it is caused by us) is a horrifying threat and deserves a much more intelligent treatment than this. Then the movie might have done some good. Now it is just one more excuse for the ignorant to shrug off our impending doom.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|I know alot of people went to the theater thinking this movie would be another one of those cheap so called horror flicks that we have seen alot in the past 8 years or so but it's not.  It's a much more smarter film.  A Drama/Thriller <br /> <br />Both points of view are represented in the movie and you the viewers can decide for yourselves what to believe.  I happen to believe that she was being held hostage in her own body by some unseen unknown evil force.  I know those types of forces do exist.
B000BB14YY|5.0|By now you have probably read enough reviews telling you that this is a great film, and probably read a few about how other DVD transfers are horrible, so let me just speak to the Criterion edition of this film.<br /><br />This transfer is amazing! The colours that Kurosawa used are finally given due justice. The image is sharp and without noise, the colours are rich (especially the outdoor greens), the sound is great.<br /><br />Finally The Criterion Collection has done justice to one of Akira Kurosawa's greatest films. As if an excellent transfer of an excellent movie wasn't enough, the second disc contains wonderful bonus material including a 74 minute documentary on Akira Kurosawa and interviews with key performers.<br /><br />For anyone ever disappointed with previous releases of this film, your wait is over.
0312995423|3.0|Well, most of us would read this after having completely fallen in love with Brown's 'Da Vinci'. Then you are bound to be disappointed. But if you didn't read DaVinci and did not expect much out of Dan Brown, then you are bound to be satisfied. <br />Actually its a good book, based on crytography in computers and encryption techniques etc. If you are bit knowledgeable on the subject, it would be little more interesting. I liked it coz I knew about cryptology and stuff a little bit. Good enough to get through the book.  <br />Initially the characters seem interesting and different. But as you progress on, they get so mundane and same old 'hero-type' figures. They don't really stay in your mind like Robert Langdon did!!  <br />And also, there isn't much suspense as you move along. You kind of will guess who the traitor is . Well, if you've read a lot of mystery novels before, you definitely will.  <br />I read this book coz this was pending in my list as I had read all other Brown books. Hmm .. not so disappointing , but not intriguing enough. U gonna buy the book ? No don't.Get it from somewhere , read it and return it. You wont feel bad then. If you've bought the book like me, its a waste of money and time too. Well, good for a lazy weekend read. Have no great expectations. You will be happy.  <br />I am waiting for Brown's next book. Something which can equal DaVinci's standards.  <br />But DaVinci is just enough to make me a big fan of Brown. <br />Have fun reading!!
140004281X|5.0|It's been a month since I finished reading this collection.  I keep finding myself suddenly thinking about one of these stories or a character or a theme that Munro develops with incredible alacrity.  It takes a well developed story to keep drawing my attention time and again, and Alice Munro is a master!
B00005YXZH|3.0|YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT is far removed from the hard rock/country hybrids created by Jeff Tweedy's former band Uncle Tupelo. Tweedy, Wilco's head honcho, wrote the lyrics and most of the music on YHF.<br /><br />I've never been a huge fan of UT or Wilco, but I finally borrowed a copy of this album and gave it several good listens after hearing about how \\"brilliant\\" and \\"beautiful\\" it is, that it was one of the best releases of 2002.<br /><br />After reading and hearing all that hype, I gotta say YHF doesn't come close to living up to it. First of all, Tweedy just isn't a very good singer, and though I wouldn't call his voice grating, it alone prevents these songs from being \\"beautiful.\\" This album gets compared to Radiohead's music quite a bit. While it does sport plenty of Radiohead-like \\"bells and whistles,\\" I hear nothing that can approach that band's musical genius and creativity. Give me Radiohead any day. But I will concede that many of the electronics on YHF are undenyably cool sounding.<br /><br />This album has a rather ramshackle, haphazard or thrown-together quality that some may find charming but I think it sounds lazy or even sloppy at times. The lyrics are largely meaningless and, to be frank, pretentious, save for the straightforward \\"Heavy Metal Drummer.\\" Ironically, the track actually sounds light and poppy, laden with gurgling electronics, although it's too sing-songy for my tastes. Tweedy's nostalgia for Kiss is pretty revealing as, musically, Kiss is one of the worst bands of all time.<br /><br />Some additional comments about these songs:<br /><br />- I find the opener \\"I Am Trying to Break Your Heart\\" to be rather annoying. It sounds sort of aimless and it has lots of extraneous, out-of-tune instruments which I don't particularly appreciate. The drums are cool though.<br /><br />- \\"Kamera\\" has considerably more musical direction and is a pretty nice little tune.<br /><br />- On \\"Radio Cure,\\" Tweedy seems to pick an arbitrary moment out of the blue to start singing (or whining, depending on your point of view), but the track does turn into a fairly intriguing mood piece.<br /><br />- I would say \\"Jesus, etc.\\" is the most \\"country\\" song here and it features a fiddle and some slide guitar or dobro. It's a pretty good track but I wouldn't exactly call it mind-blowing.<br /><br />- \\"I'm the Man Who Loves You\\" has an annoying guitar that sounds like crap, but it becomes pretty cool sounding once it gets past that single-note solo. I guess it's supposed to have some kind of ragged charm, but I'm not completely feeling it and it sounds a bit out of place here. Otherwise, the song is actually one of the best on the album and I really dig the horns too. The track provides a welcome dose of energy that YHF could've used a bit more of. To me, \\"... Man Who Loves You\\" sounds halfway to Simon & Garfunkel which, for those who don't know, is a compliment as Paul Simon is one of the most highly revered songwriters of the 20th century.<br /><br />- \\"Poor Places\\" is . . . interesting, the way it builds to an incredible, noisy climax.<br /><br />- Ultimately, I find the closer, \\"Reservations,\\" to be a bit boring. The aimless electronics and piano chords that wrap up YHF are pretty pretentious, although I suppose those who like to hear this album while they are falling asleep quite enjoy the way it ends.<br /><br />Overall, YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT isn't a bad listen, but it's far from the revelatory work of art I've been lead to believe it was. I made an honest attempt to review it objectively, but in truth I don't really care if I ever hear it again considering all the other music out there that turns me on so much more.of view), but the track does turn into a fairly intriguing mood piece.    - I would say \\"Jesus, etc.\\" is the most \\"country\\" song here and it features a fiddle and some slide guitar or dobro.

B00005JOHI|1.0|I was curious to see this adaptation of the novel as the director chose to place it in the late 1790's when Jane Austen finished her first draft of the story rather than in 1813 when it was finally published.  It was a different time to be sure and the setting is much less pristine than other versions of this story.  However, the filmakers seem to have taken this as artistic license to insert all sorts of confusing anachronisms.   <br /> <br />For example, there are times when Lizzie publicly visits someone with her hair down.  As a young lady who is \\"out\\", her hair would  come down only at night and being seen in public with it down would make others perceive her as a little girl.  Lady Catherine the proud and haughty, would not say \\"thank you\\" to a servant upon receiving a cup of tea, she probably wouldn't even deign to nod in their direction.  And, she certainly wouldn't show up in the dead of night to visit someone.  The most glaring example is Bingly casually showing up in Jane's room while she is sick in bed.  Never, would such a thing happen!   <br /> <br />Keira Knightly herself is more than a little anachronistic as she is not an actress who hides her modernity well.  She seems entirely too smug with her jutting jaw and toothy grins to be a believable Lizzie.  I thought she was great in \\"Bend it Like Beckham\\" but she has never been convincing in a period piece, not even \\"Pirates\\".  Her thinness is painful to behold and would have seemed freakishly unhealthy for that time. <br /> <br />Worst of all is that the film has not enough pride and not nearly enough prejudice.  Except for his first scene, Darcy seems more pathetically shy than proud.  You actually feel sorry for him.  Lizzie then, has less to react to with prejudice and with the story of Wickham being so shoddily done, her realization of the depth of her character misjudgements is weak.  There is never that moment where she says, \\"and then I knew myself\\". <br /> <br />Still, the story is strong enough to be salvageable even with this treatment.  The cinematography is lovely too.  I'm just left with the feeling that they figured that American audiences wouldn't be sophisticated to notice all the sloppiness.  We are so often stuck with only action films and insipid comedies that we should be grateful for any substantial period piece.  With Keira Knightly, it wouldn't be languishing on the art house circuit either.  So they mucked it up and tacked on a very silly ending (not there in the British version) and sent it out for sale. <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|I must say, there are two albums made in the twentieth century that completely define what music is: Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon and Radiohead's Ok Computer.  This album is by far the greatest album I have ever heard.  I actually got into Radiohead when a friend of mine lent me his entire collection and of course, like the mindless drone I used to be, I went right for Pablo Honey.  I was simply immature at that point.  I soon explored The Bends, and then came Ok Computer.  Of course it took a few listenings to get used to, but once I did I couldnt get enough.  I listened to it more, and more, and more.  Every single track, i repeat, EVERY SINGLE TRACK, is AMAZING!!! There are no exceptions.  I remember just lying on my bed one night and listened to it from front to back without stopping, like I had with Dark Side before, and it totally changed me.  Paranoid Android, Subterranean Sick Alien, Exit Music, Karma Police, Lucky, The Tourist; oh whats the bother in listing all of my favorite tracks when they are all whisper at complete music genious.  Everyone who can sit there and say that Radiohead arent that great simply are mindless idiots who just do not understand what real music is.  As a musician I realize what REAL music is.  What real music isnt is this MTV emo/whining crap.  People who are knowledgable and understand what music is all about would never dis this album.
0553801503|2.0|Having avidly followed this series, I anticipated a real downright bangup story to come forth over the 5 year wait since the last installment.  Surely Mr. Martin could have gotton on with the story and advanced the plot so we could (soon) have some resolution on the dangling plot left out there 5 years ago. <br /> <br />However, I was greatly disappointed as Mr. Martin bored me with the most inconsequential details of many unimportant characters.  He also wearied me with lineages of every minor character on their frequent  chance meetings throughout the book. <br /> <br />By the last 150 pages, I was skimming.  I felt cheated, just like I did when I weathered through Book 5 of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, finally figuring out that I'd been had. I somehow forced myself to finish, with a disgusted anger, glad at least to be done with it. <br /> <br />Somehow, I feel Mr. Martin is out to follow the same path as Jordan, endlessly dragging his story out year by year.  I just don't want to wait for it and be teased any longer. <br /> <br />When Brienne, one of the minor characters, finally got killed, it was the highlight of the book for me.  At least I no longer would have to read of her boring hunts for Sansa Stark, always never finding her and going in circles.  I cheered the death of her, and hopefully Martin won't be tempted to resurrect her in books to come.  I won't be going back for more however. I'm done with this series.  <br /> <br />Time for me to hit the road Jack, and find something more satisfying.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Mariah keeps getting better and better with her music!! She is very talented with her gift of music, she really knows how to express it well! Not only were her hit songs 'We Belong Together' and 'Shake It Off' good, but now she offers more and more with her new recent hit song 'Don't Forget About Us.' Mariah keeps suprising us with her music over and over again, which makes us wanna buy more of them! This is a wonderful CD to listen to, hey if you a big fan of Mariah Carey, this CD is a MUST to add to your collection. As a long-time fan, I would definately keep this CD forever, it's one of the best, and I think you should too. Mariah is an extraoridinary singer, and she can hit those high notes better than any Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears or Jessica Simpson anytime! Her Christmas CD was a big thing a few years ago, and it still is. She's got a lot to go for, and so far she's doing it very well,from the fans point of view. The Fans cannot get enough of her, and we can't get enough of her music. =)
0140067477|5.0|First I have to address the 1 star reviews... were you reading the same book? How did you get all this negitivity from a simple book? Hoff isn't knocking anyone, if you read the book there's a whole section dedicated to the feeling that everyone has a place in life. The \\"Owls\\" The \\"Tiggers\\" The \\"Rabbits\\" ect... he's not saying that these are bad qualities just that too much \\"Rabbit\\" or too much \\"Eeyore\\" can be bad. It seems to me the people who gave this book a one star are exactly the people who this author is trying to get across too, it's your own pre judgements that don't allow you to enjoy this book.  <br /> <br />That being said this is a wonderful book, I've always been a huge Pooh fan and I've always used these characters to discribe people. Everyone knows a \\"Eeyore\\" and a \\"Owl\\" and so on, and in some regards everyone has a \\"Piglet\\" part of them or a \\"Tigger\\" That's all this book is saying, the sooner you realize it the better. Hoff isn't saying if your a \\"Owl\\" change because you won't ever be happy. He's saying the sooner you know who you are and accept you for you, the happier you'll be. The sooner you can \\"Let go\\" of the things that we all get wrapped up in, the happier you'll be. It's a shame when people can't see that.
0553801503|4.0|I give this book 4 stars because, to be quite honest, it lacked my favorite characters (Jon, Tyrion, Bran, Daenerys, etc.). It wasn't until the end of the book and Mr. Martin's afterword that I understood why they their prescence was sorely lacking. Hopefully, however, A Dance of Dragons will throw them all back in the limelight. However, I applaud Mr. Martin's (and his publishers, I guess)in splitting his attention--this way, the plot can move forward without having to drag through 2000+ pages (I think he needs to share his secret with Robert Jordan!) <br />Stick with this book, because all the action is at the end and it gives you a satisfied feeling.

B00000DQSZ|5.0|If you are a Kraftwerk fan you must own this album.  It is a bit slower paced than Computer World, but richer and deeper in sound.  To me, the music is still characterized as background music, but very enjoyable, relaxing and soothing to listen to.
0307263118|5.0|John Banville is a poet, a wordsmith without current peer, a writer of such extraordinary gifts that he dwells in his own stratosphere. He is able to distill a life's story in a thin novel, yet in the telling of that story uncover more nuances about time and the paths left by incidental occurrences that pepper the life cycle with such beauty of language and sensitivity to nuances of character and place and moment that reading his book becomes one of life's luxuries.  He is simply a master of his craft.<br /><br />The story is simple: one man's life, inconsequential by Max Morden's own admission, is told from the vantages of a childhood unveiled from imbedded memories, from the recent past from which he is in mourning from the death of his wife Anna, and from the present when accompanied by his only child Claire he returns to The Cedars, once the home of the Grace family - Mr Grace, Mrs Grace for whom he felt his first passion, their twins Myles and Chloe with Chloe being his first love, and the governess Rose - a place where fifty years ago he spent an indelible summer with the events that shaped his psyche and life, yet now is a dumpy apartment house run by two old folks who watch him drink away his grieving days.  With incredible skill Banville weaves his story from three vantages, each uncovering or explaining the climax of the story that awaits the last pages of the novel to intricately weave together.<br /><br />Banville meditates on death in every manifestation that portion of the life cycle takes, and yet he does so with such avoidance of the morbid or maudlin and with every bow to the mystery that death as an occurrence leaves in its path that his views enhance us.  His 'style' of writing includes conversing with his reader, pausing to apologize for possibly misusing words or definitions or time frame lapses, a manner of writing that brings the reader in such close proximity with the characters and the incidents, the landscapes and the moods that reading this book at any but a very slow pace would be a grievous error.<br /><br />But how does one review a book as perfect as this?  One doesn't.  It is sufficient to invite lovers of great literature to share the hallowed space contained in THE SEA.  Brilliant!

B000002L7Y|5.0|How can anybody not be familiar with \\"Take on me\\".  However, if you have not listened to the whole album, you need to check it out.  The reason I like this album the most is because it also had the best A-ha song ever made, \\"The sun always shines on TV\\".  Man! everytime I put this song and listen to it, I get chills!!.  I just love the mix of instruments and Morten Harket's vocals.  Try listening to this song while you are running.  <br />5 Stars all the way!!
B00005AWMF|5.0|I first encountered Sade(pronounced like Shah Day)during mid eighties when I first heard the hit song \\"Smooth Operator\\" which surely well showed us how she sounds. Her voice and excellently orchestrated jazzy pop appeals to wide range of music fans including metal fans. When I grab this compilation and listen to the latter half of the collection I missed during early 90s, I am truly happy that I took this one.<br /><br />I am familiar with most of the first half side of the compilation such as \\"Smooth Operator\\" \\"Sweetest Taboo\\" \\"Never As Good As The First Time\\". Particularly I love every track from PROMISE album that I have the copy of. Of latter half of the tracks I am less familiar CHERISH THE DAY captivates me so much.<br /><br />Verdict: Reassuring Sade is stronger than ever<br /><br />Rating: 91 out of 100. Far beyond 80s pop nostalgy.<br /><br />Fitting mood: My current bedtime album.<br /><br />Recommeded: Smooth jazzy pop fans and 80s pop fans as well as fans of Sting, Suzanne Vaga, Tracy Chapman, Kenny G and Groovy Toto sound.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you aren't familiar with Firefly the series, please give this film a shot.  The characters are real people, script is witty, and this is a film about loyalty and compassion.  The storyline is great and you will find yourself caring about these folks long before the end of the movie.  The series was wonderful in that Joss Whedon way, and the movie will make you long for the next installment.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album is an indication of John's mobility to flow from genre to genre and excel in doing so. Not many can become an acoustic pop sensation and drop it on a dime and make electric driven hard-core blues! Could you imagine Dave Matthews or James Taylor doing this???  <br /> <br />Many have poorly rated this album, and it's something to note that there is a trend that has risen. The weaker or stronger the rating is, seems to resemble the reviewer's knowledge of music and musicianship in general! It takes a true musician of an established caliber to fully appreciate what John is creating in a music world filled with reality tv pop singers and phony, irritating so-called rappers who do not play or write their own music. The music on this album is BLUES-ROCK, if you don't like rock or the blues, you probably would rate it 1 star. This isn't cheesy pop music, but guitar driven rock with a blues spin.  So don't expect the Dave Matthews style Mayer, but more of an Eric Clapton or Jonny Lang. <br /> <br />Though John is not technically a \\"bluesman\\" as many have stated, he has clearly marked his contentioncy of becoming one in the near future. Mayer is the real deal, despite what many have said. If he wasn't great then he wouldn't have been recording and playing countless shows side by side with other absolutely great performers and \\"guitar gods\\" such as Buddy Guy, Eric Clapton, B.B.King, Herbie Hancock, Paul Schaefer, John Scoefield, and even country guitar king Brad Paisley, along with his backing duo Pino and Steve. Mayer is clearly bringing a blues revival to the younger generation, which along with young blues prodigies Jonny Lang and Kenny Wayne Shepherd (with whom Mayer takes a close third behind these guys), should make a loud awakening among teens and others of all different ages to the new blues-rock genre they are each establishing. <br /> <br />If you enjoy the blues and good \\"real\\" music, this album is good news for you. If you expect anything other than rockand blues, you might not appreciate this album like you should. If you aren't a huge blues-rock fan, just keep an open mind about it and you just might end up liking it as many people have. <br />

1591391105|3.0|We all know that the first three months on a job is pivotal and critical.  This was the title of a movie about JFK's first Ninety Days in office as President of the United States and the way his administration dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis showed that he was indeed not too young to hold that office.  In any profession, we have to show our abilities to do the job for which we were hired.      Written by the top management expert, a former Harvard business professor, he lists the common traps of trying to do too much too soon and being led astray by trusting the wrong people.  This happened to me on more than one job.  He shows the reader how to manage expectations and strive to reach your full potential.  He cautions about the problem of filling the shoes of the person you replaced, and shows the difficulty of the successor syndrome.  It is demeaning and not for a neophyte.    At Harvard, he co-wrote RIGHT FROM THE START: TAKING CHARGE IN A NEW LEADERSHIP ROLE.  He's learned the hard way by copycats that you can copyright a sentence but not the ideas it represents.  His is the management advice book to follow.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was simply the best thing not only ever on HBO, but ever put on televison. It was told from the point of the view of the men in the trenches, not by paper pushing generals in Washington. The series stayed very true to Ambrose's book. Let you get to know these men who were called upon to save the world from an unspeakable evil. Kudos to HBO, Tom Hanks, and Steven Spielberg

B0000024SI|4.0|Like a Rolling Stone came out on Rock and Roll radio stations in the mid 60's. <br />Like a Roling Stone was Dylans first electric hit. At that time he was alientating his folk audience and gaining a new audience. <br />This is not his best effort but many people will say it was their favorite Dylan album. <br />It takes a lot to laugh, A train to Cry, and Ballad of a Thin Man are also great songs. <br />We also got to hear a marathon that lasted nineteen minutes, Desolation Row. <br />This in my mind is among Dylans top 5 albums ever. For any Dylan fan and certainly any collector this is a must.
0142000655|5.0|I was required to read this for an English course, and was not looking forward to it because I had not enjoyed other Steinbeck books... after the first 10 or so pages I couldn't put it down. Whether or not you have enjoyed Steinbeck before, make sure you check this out.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Alison Krauss has taken 4 superb musicians and herself and formed possibly the best bluegrass band ever. <br />She has Jerry Douglass who has been called the Jimi Hendrix of the dobro. <br />She also has Dan Tyminski and Ron Block playing guitar and banjo respectively. <br />Barry Bailes is a solid gut bass player. <br />On this CD we hear songs from her recent album New Favorite. She does a classic remake of the old pop song Baby, now that I've found you. <br />Bright Sunny south is a civil war song, that I listen to over and over. <br />Take me for the longing is another great song from New Favorite, and the Remake Man of Constant Sorrow from Oh Brother How Art Thou, won several grammys for her. <br />When you say nothing at All is another monumental song on the CD. <br />The musicians are the best in the world, Allison Krauss has a very pure voice. <br />I dont listen to much country music but this CD is a treat to listen to. Jerry Douglass is in top form. <br />I cant wait till she comes to Las Vegas
B000B8QEZG|4.0|For most of her career, Madonna has been a conduit between the dance and pop worlds.  In the 80's, she brought \\"black\\" music to the pop charts (\\"Holiday\\" and \\"Lucky Star\\").  In the 90's, she helped house music reach the masses (\\"Vogue,\\" \\"Deeper and Deeper\\").  In the new century, she's made techno accesible to the herds (from \\"Frozen\\" on).  Even so, Confessions on a Dance Floor is probably the first time since her debut that Madonna has let her dance sensibilities eclipse her skillful pop stylings and the results are enormously rewarding.   <br /> <br />\\"Hung Up\\" is a killer hitbound ditty but, if you like that one, then you'll be in ecstasy from \\"Sorry\\" (track 3) all the way through \\"How High\\" (track 9).  I do not mean you'll just like these songs; you will be insanely addicted to them.  The pop-dance balance Madonna achieves is perfect.  \\"Future Lovers\\" could be a Luke Slater track. When Madonna chants \\"get offa my street\\" in \\"I Love New York\\" I could SEE candy ravers screaming and jumping like methed-up bunnies. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is pure pop heaven underneath the dance sensibilities, and \\"Jump\\" cops the Pet Shop Boys' \\"West End Girls\\" synth line to great effect. <br /> <br />The album is a masterpiece until \\"Isaac\\" brings the party to a crashing halt.  Of course, things are supposed to wind down at that point anyway and \\"Like It or Not\\" is a exceptionally strong pop finish with lyrics of unrepetent individuality.  <br /> <br />Overall, I found the continuous mix format an excellent choice, and it succeeded in creating the club feel Madonna was going for.  Lyrically, my only gripe is that she didn't use the F word in \\"I Love New York.\\"  Aside from that, I admire the way she often worked meaningful topics into the rather limited lyrical scope of the dance format.   <br /> <br />I hope Madonna will finally get her due as a producer for crafting this killer CD.  While I'm sure Orbit, Mirwais, and Price all contributed mightily to their respective albums with her, I have CDs from all three on their own (I bought Price's \\"Darkdancer\\" back in 1999), and none of their stuff holds a candle to Madonna's. She's clearly the spark here and after over 20 years she shows no signs of slowing down.
0439679958|3.0|this book was alright it wasnt five stars just because how every c hapter until the very end seems like it is the same. matt hears whispers he gos into the woods everytime. he finds a dead body. yeah that was realy interesting, not really. there are only two interesting parts. when he fights the skelitons in the museum and when he is using his powers for the first controlled time at the nuclear reactor. this book is too slow for a.d.d. readers who like action around every corner this book is not for you.
B00005LQ04|5.0|I'm an adult. kind of.  but I watched this movie at night in the dark with headphones and it freaked me out.  Just the main theme playing during the menu sent shivers up my spine.  I had to nurse a glass of cognac during the entire viewing just to keep the nerves in check.  This movie is stylish and colorful and just cool. I don't recommend watching the music video as part of \\"extras\\" on the DVD though.  It sort of diminishes the mysteriousness of the soundtrack.  Actually, the video is pretty awesome.  Those guys in the band look really evil, especially the keyboard player when he starts mouthing some of the strange haloween music sounds in the song.  (And if you are one of those people that like to go all out for the trick-or-treaters on halloween, might I suggest playing this soundtrack on a little radio hidden on your front porch.) Try and disregard the fact that they're playing in a vacant office building.  the special effects are awesome too.  especially the way the entire screen looks like it's on fire as the band initially enters the vacant office building. It some how reminds me of ozzy's crazy train video.  i think they are using some of the same synthesizers.  Kind of like that wow wow keyboard effect thing.
0399241515|4.0|i gave this book 4 stars only because the begginingg is a little slow and dosnt make a whole lot of sense. but if you keep with it there is lots of surprising twists like how alex's father dies and the great ending with the hot air baloon. this is a great fast moving story after the first 30-50 pages
B00000I5Y6|5.0|I've always liked Kansas and although this compilation is kind of brief, what is here is good. The sound is very good and it hits all of the high points of Kansas' career. If you are a really devoted Kansas fan, you might be disappointed and you'll need more, such as \\"The Ultimate Kansas\\", but for the casual fan, this works well.
0553801503|2.0|The genius of Martin's world was that it was brutal - it hammered the reality into the fantasy.  Where other novels were afraid to give the main character so much as a black eye Martin beat them, chopped them, raped them, kicked them and if they were lucky killed them.  The problem with the series is that Mr. Martin has become far too predicable.  With this latest installment he has confirmed that his world is firmly governed by Murphy's Law.  We have come to expect the worse, and a steady (and increasingly monotonous) pattern has emerged.  Mr. Martin's brilliance was apparent in his first book where we did not expect the headman's axe, or the hangman's noose and when it came we were devastated... when a hero died we cried...when a treachery was revealed we roared in anger...but now if someone gets away with a stabbing they are counted lucky...if they lose a limb or three we call their tormentors amateurs.  In fact, if someone ends the book sound of mind and body we are shocked! It has simply become too difficult for us to care, it would be akin to developing a close and loving bond with a canary in the mines.  Sadly, what was once a brilliant game of thrones has degenerated into a bleak and meandering plot, with a sadistic author marching his sorry band of characters to the slaughter.  Moreover, sundering the original in two means that the characters in this latest installment will stagnate over the next two years while we get the news from the other lot...splitting the book was a bad idea, and splitting it in this manner a terrible one.  This reader hopes Mr. Martin is able to reign in his story and his sadism, otherwise his work is no different from the fluff...just we expect the parade of horribles instead of the parade of heroes, wiser men have said that variety is the spice of life.

B000002952|5.0|Gloria Estefan put you in the right romantic mood with this great collection of songs. Here voice sounds even better when she goes back to here roots and sing spanish. It doesnt matter if you know the words, the music speaks for itself. It lifts you, it moves you, and this is quality all over.<br /><br />The soundpicture is clear, with great acoustic certainly on the guitar, and Gloria`s voice is even better here, then when she sings american language songs. The good thing with this cd, is that it`s so much room inbetween the instruments that lift`s forward Estefan`s voice to a higher level of \\"earjoy\\"<br /><br />Track 7 Si Senor and Track 9 Montuno shows that Gloria Estefan really knows here roots when it comes to the rythmic upbeat songs too. I dont know much of the words, but the music speak for it self.  Like Track 12 Tradicion, im agree, and i think that the word is universal. This Cd keeps the \\"tradicion\\" when it comes too roots and the \\"real thing\\"
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Sadly, you are left wishing that Liman had reprised his role in the directors chair.  Although the movie was serviceable and entertaining, I found it wanting in a few areas.  For one, the script seemed a little rehashed (especially the overly-long car chase).  But I did really enjoy Damon's acting... he actually makes you believe this has happened to him and he brings both intelligence and an impressive phsyicality to the role I didn't think he had in him.  I respect him far more as an actor than his craptacular sometime-partner and friend, Mr. Afleck. <br /> <br />They kill off Ms. Potente's character in the very beginning of the movie. I'm sure those who didn't like her in the first film will enjoy that (I thought she executed well in both films).  It also provides a great deal of motivation for Jason Bourne.  The cloaked workings of the first film carry over here, and the excellent cast brings the story to life. <br /> <br />I wanted the movie to be longer, bringing more of Bourne's story to life and it could have dropped the car chase that seemed lifted from the first flick.  I think the \\"Agency\\" caved a little too quickly, and the new woman director could have had some other hidden agenda, etc. to bring more conflict to the film.  It needed a few more original action sequences, but it still rates a 3.5 simply for the cool-as-hell Bourne.  I'm rounding up to a 4 because, well...  I still wish I was Jason Borne and that says a lot about the movie (and maybe about me).  :-)
B000AYEIZY|1.0|If you are reading this for advice: save your money.  Burn a copy off of a friend.  They are obviously all still accomplished at their instruments.  The fact that the three of them are still alive & can play is immense on it's own right.  We know, their all great-hall of fame,etc etc. One reviewer said they are all playing \\"like a band\\" now, thats not what we want from Cream!  We want that abusive \\"crawling over each others parts\\" type of playing.  Take I'm so glad.  On the original, by the time Clapton's solo is peaking, Bruce is playing as high on the fretboard as EC.  That \\"fighting\\" is what made them (in my mind) what they were.  Now, it's a more polite version, its almost been reduced to a shuffle-which does not work!  The overall performance sounds forced.  If you happen to see the DVD, it's even worse.
B00023B1LC|5.0|This movie had me wanting more when I saw it.  Everything about it is really well done; from the acting and script to the direction and stunt work.  The plot is somewhat predictable, but still seems fresh and exciting.  The stuntwork is really top shelf, and you walk away feeling like you wish you were Jason, but without all the headaches, memory loss and people trying to kill you. <br /> <br />I know I thought it would be pretty cool waking up with a few million, the ability to disable and disarm any assailant, speak several languages fluently and counterintelligence skills.  I'm sure that was a lot of the draw for many fans of this film.  The pacing kept you involved, yet made time to develop the characters.  The clever car chase felt fresh and even though it was a little over the top, it seemed borderline believable.  The fight scenes are fantastic (and the DVD shows the staging and training involved). <br /> <br />Jason is a better Bond thand Bond.  I loved this movie and think it's approachable to all.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|This is an AMAZING CD!!! I have the original version and I purchased this one also. And I did so upon my own free will. I didn't feel obligated in any way whatsoever. I LOVE the new songs and the videos. It's hard to make a great album better, but Mariah did just that. If you haven't purchased the original, then I would definitely get this version. I don't feel like I'm being taken advantage of because of the re-release. This is not the first by a recording artist and it surely won't be the last. I can't hate. I'm a huge fan of Mariah Carey and this is one of her BEST CD's. The 4 new songs, \\"Don't Forget About Us,\\" \\"Makin' It Last All Night,\\" \\"So Lonely,\\" and the \\"We Belong Together - Remix\\" are GREAT additions to the CD. This is a smart re-release and a good package. If you were planning on buying this as a gift for the holiday, then purchase the ULTRA PLATINUM EDITION CD/DVD. You get 4 videos and 4 extra songs. It's been 9 months since the original release, so I don't think the fans are being slighted. Since Mariah's probably not going to record a new studio album for another year or so, then you're better off with this version because it has a little extra.     But I recommend you buy this from Target, Circuit City, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, or Tower Records. Please don't support this company. Can you find their customer service number? No. Have you tried to complain about orders that don't ship? I have. I equate ordering from this company to ordering From Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.    Here's their Customer Service# 1-800-201-7575. Write this down because you'll need it!!! I saved this from a few years ago, but it's current. I used it last month. It works!!!
B00005JOHI|4.0|I found Pride and Prejudice to be a superbly well adapted film. While the Jane Austen purists may not approved of all the changes in this movie, I thought the script was superbly well thought out and its adopted the book into a well made two hour movie. This movie is basically the director Joe Wright's vision of the book. There is nothing wrong with it. After all, the three Lord of the Rings movies were Peter Jackson's vision of the book, not the book itself.<br /><br />The movie proves to be well directed and well acted. The two key characters, Lizzie and Darcy were well represented by Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyn. Knightley proves to be the right age and she managed to captured the character of Lizzie superbly well. I thought McFadyn did well but from all I read, Colin Firth from that mini-series hold the gold standard for playing Darcy. Firth must be very good indeed. The movie choose to centered around those two characters and goes from the initial false impression of each other to realization of truth about each other. The supporting cast proves to be quite excellent, both Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench steal scenes during their limited time on the screen. I thought Brenda Blethyn who played the super annoying mother probably did the best job of all. Tom Hollander who played Cousin William Collins also proves to be excellent. Thanks to him, Lizzie's horror of the thought of marrying his character can be made clear for all to see. The production values proves to be very high, costumes fitted the time period of the book very nicely.<br /><br />This movie probably will not satisfied the pure-hearted Jane Austen fans. But for all others, this two hour movie will do quite nicely as it captured the spirit of the book and its two lead characters.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Just months after her all spanish album Fijacion Oral vol. 1 Shakira is back with her English conquest Oral Fixation vol. 2, a great album from the Latin singer.  Shakira is back with her 'acquired taste' vocals, bringing a powerful punch for those who want to listen.  What has Shakira done to step it up since her 2001 successful effort \\"Laundry Service\\"?  Well, most notably she has stepped it up lyrically.  Also, in my opinion her voice has only gotten better, though like I stated before, he vocals are an `acquired taste'.<br /><br />Things start off on great notes, such as the questioning religion track \\"How Do You Do\\" and the full fired lead single \\"Don't Bother\\".  Sure, on paper \\"Don't Bother\\" doesn't look like much, but when in action it's great.  By the third track it's reached one of the two best numbers with \\"Illegal\\" ft. Carlos Santana.  Everything about the song is perfect, lyrically it's superb, vocally she's never been better, and the whole mood of the track is so laid back you could rest a baby on it.<br /><br />The second track to take top honors would be \\"Dreams For Plans\\".  Everything from the instrumentals to the lyrics are beautiful.  And though it's a \\"say goodbye\\" song, one will put that aside and instead smile at the elegance of it all.  Also, one can enjoy songs such as the unique \\"Animal City\\", the funky \\"Timor\\", and the seductive \\"Your Embrace\\" where Shakira harps \\"Tell me what's the use of a 24\\" waist/ If you don't touch me\\".  So what exactly brings this album down.  Easy, \\"Hey You\\" is just plain bad.  It's irritating to the point I had to skip to the next track.  And though not horrible, \\"The Day and the Time\\" ft. Gustavo Cerati can get just plain boring.<br /><br />However, only two tracks are lacking the quality in which the rest of the album does more than make up for.  So anyone who is a fan of Shakira should pick Oral Fixation vol. 2 up.  Shakira has really outdone her self as an artist in her career.  She's gone from dominating Mexican Air waves, to dominating America in a style all to her own.  Congratulations should be given to such a loyal artist who despite mainstream ways, has never changed hers.ating Mexican Air waves, to dominating America in a style all to her own.  Congratulations should be given to such a loyal artist who despite mainstream ways, has never changed hers.
B00005JO1P|3.0|I will probably write a minority review here. This biopic starring Joaquin Phoenix as the famous country singer, Johnny Cash looked very much like a clone of last year biopic, Ray. We got the same theme here, poor upbringing, childhood guilt trip, drug addiction, making it big and losing his family at the same time and the both films end around the same time period, never going into their mature years. Only major differences between the two movies were the color of their skin and sound of their music. The major reason why this movie wasn't an one star movie for all this copycat format was that Reese Witherspoon gave a real fantastic performance as June Carter. While Joaquin Phoenix was good, I didn't think he was great. Witherspoon proves to totally effective and she virtually overshadowed Phoenix in almost every scene they were together. She brought this movie up to a high level by her performance which I thought to be authentic, well interpret and settled. While this may sound bit unfair to Phoenix since he had the hardest job of capturing Johnny Cash without mimicking him, I thought he didn't do that good of job. Maybe the script let him down on that issue.<br /><br />Both of them were well supported by their fellow cast members. The music production was very good and it told the musical story very well. But the script was bit on the weak side. Movie seem to go from episode to episode, home scene to music scene and so on. What made Johnny Cash tick? What were his motivations? Answers seem very superficial here. There just wasn't any major surprises in the movie and although my knowledge of Johnny Cash came from only one book and two CDs, I didn't see him too well on the movie screen.<br /><br />Outside of Witherspoon's superb performance, this movie is basically by the number routine. Isn't there a music star out there who didn't have poor upbringing, who didn't have some sort of childhood guilt trip, who wasn't a drug or alcohol abuser and didn't lose his family when he made it big???mily when he made it big??? <br />
0812550706|4.0|I kind of hesitate to give this one only four stars, but I will because I want to be fair to the whole series. The books that follow are amazing. I found them tremendously entertaining in a way that stimulates the mind. Card uses his stories to introduce interesting perspectives of human nature. The characters are so real that we actually care about them and understand them and feel for them. I give the series as a whole five out of five stars, and for that reason I very highly recomend Ender's Game. I give Ender's Game only four because it is almost just an introduction. It definitely stands on it's own very well, but after reading what comes after, it is very limited in comparison.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|In my humble opinion this album is an amazing effort and completely original. I had no idea what to expect when I bought this CD because who ever heard of Sufjan Stevens? This album I do not believe is for everyone, but for individuals who like imaginative and laid back music this is one of the best I have ever heard. The combinations of different beats, choruses, instruments, and lyrics make this a truly complete album. I can listen to this album over and over again and every time I do I learn to appreciate it that much more. This is not an album to put on at you next party but if you want to put something on just to relax to or throw on during your next road trip, perfect! The only question I have for Sufjan is what is the next state because I am on board.
B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb Of God is probably the best modern hardcore band out there.  Great drummer, guitars, bass, and vocals contribute to an all around phenominal sound.  I would suggest buying this album whether you are first trying Lamb Of God or whether you are a fan and just don't own it yet.  You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />As far as Mr. Ashlee Simpson goes, NO ONE CARES WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY!! If you don't like hardcore, then why would you review this?! And why the hell would you even dare to say that you appreciate Simpson's music?  She just sucks and she has the vocabulary consistency of a dead cow.  Her most recent album is called \\"I Am Me.\\"  Well, thanks for the update, Ashlee.  And by the way, you don't have to like it, but it does take talent to scream or sing from the throat, believe it or not.  A lot more talent than it takes to lip sync.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|!!!Gilmore is great. With funny writing, suspenceful episodes, and great romances this makes for a great gilmore season!!! OH JESUS!!! This season dvd is great with loads of extras, suchs as a a film by kirk, fun commentary with witty remarks and games including stuff with the writers like gilmore remarks. A whole lot of fun. Once again Lauren Graham gives and uncannily great proformence along with kelly bishup and kekio agenda. So i say buy this great season of gilmore girls along with the others <br />JAREd:(
B00003CX8U|5.0|This is Bob Fosse at his best.  This is a semi autobiographical movie.  Fosse was mounting the musical \\"Chicago\\" starring ex wife Gwen Verdon and finishing the film \\"Lenny\\" and had a mild coronary. <br /> <br />In this film director Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is mounting a new musical starring is ex wife (Leland Palmer) despite the fact she is too old for the role.  At the same time, he is editing a film called \\"The Standup\\" (Cliff Gorman).  Like Fosse, Gideon is a womanizer who lives on uppers, downers, Alka Setlzer and cigarettes.  He lives with his star dancer (Ann Reinking - who is considered the quintessential Fosse dancer) and daughter.  During the rehearsals, he has a heart attack.  This begins a series of fantasy sequences and flashbacks all hosted by the Angel of Death (Jessica Lange in the comeback role of the 80's).  This later proceeds into the final sequence which is hosted by Fosse alumni Ben Vereen. <br /> <br />This film has many layers to it including a fascinating behind the scenes look at the mounting of a musical and look at the editing of a film.  The \\"Take Off with Us\\" number is truly spectacular.  For most of the cast, this is their finest performances.  The technical side is the best.  Tony Walton proves that he is the best set and costume designer with his fantasy sequences.  Alan Heim needs to be credited with creating the music video with his cutting edge film editing. <br /> <br />If you to see a master class in film making this is the one to watch. <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS: <br /> <br />Commentary by Roy Scheider (Did not listen to this) <br /> <br />Interviews with Roy Scheider - very good. <br /> <br />Filming clips with Bob Fosse - very good <br />
B000AP04FG|5.0|I can't remember the last movie I saw where I enjoyed almost every moment the characters were on-screen together.  This is one of those times.  Here's why: <br />Chemistry:   <br />I don't know exactly what Brad and Angelina have going on in their private lives...and I don't care.  All I know is that their obvious on-screen chemistry is what makes this movie. They are totally awesome together as their bickering, fighting and constant competing will show.  There's a well-balanced 'point-counterpoint' to their acting in this movie that makes you wonder what they'll do and say next.  (Remember when the Smiths each failed to kill each other at an opportune moment and he yells, \\"Chicken$hit!\\" at her, to which she replies, \\"Pu$$y!\\") <br />Style:   <br />Another reviewer commented on how this movie reminded him/her of the old black and white movies that were strong on banter and style.  Visually, this movie was very pleasing.  Added to the attractiveness of both lead actors, they were dressed well all the time...Even when they went out to assassinate someone.  They didn't skimp on the secondary characters either, except Vince Vaughn's character sometimes wore t-shirts--at least Angelina's fellow female assassins were dressed to the nines. <br />Vince Vaughn:   <br />Is so funny.  I don't even think he's trying to be funny half of the time, he's just got that perfect comic timing where he can say almost anything and it will be funny.  His scenes at home with his mom had me cracking up. <br />Other Small Details:   <br />Did you notice the shirt \\"the Tank\\" was wearing in the hotel room with Brad? And the outfits that the Smiths were wearing when they met Vince V. at the diner.  Just fun.  I love everything about this movie. <br />The Fight: <br />I'm glad they never let the fact that it was a \\"boy-girl\\" fight prevent it from being a full-out fight scene.
B000001FC0|5.0|\\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" is a great album.  Period. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" made it big, but the entire album from beginning to end hooks you and doesn't let go.  There's a mystical, haunting thread that runs through the entire thing.  \\"I Believe\\" is one of the most beautiful songs every produced.  While that tune is a world away from the harsh \\"Mother's Talk\\" there's still that same haunting background melody going just bellow the surface in both songs. <br /> <br />I could say more, but I think everyone should buy this album, so you can listen for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.
B0009UC7HA|2.0|...as the story (however stupid) drags on (into nowhere). Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says \\"The hunt for the gold begins here\\" and \\"The search for the mysterious ship\\" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment. Sahara is a failure, lacks charm and story, and will soon be forgotten.
B00000K3CK|5.0|There's a reason that almost 60 years later, this durable classic still touches the hearts of filmgoers:  it's beautiful heartwarming story of believing and having faith in others.  Edmund Gwenn deservedly won a supporting actor Oscar for his role as Kris Kringle, a department store Santa who says he really is the jolly old fellow.  Once the nasty corporate psychologist (a delightful Porter Hall) gets hold of Kris, though, we find our Santa facing commitment in a mental home unless lawyer John Payne (a great performance here) can provide legitimate proof that Kris is who he says he is.  The movie is lovingly performed and produced and stands the test of time, and most of  today's Christmas movies pale in comparison.  Maureen O'Hara is a lovely mama; the late Natalie Wood shows her star was shining brightly even at the age of nine; and veteran character actors Gene Lockhart, William Frawley, Thelma Ritter and Jack Albertson all add to the festivities.  Truly one of our finest Christmas movies.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The Phantom of The Opera is, on the stage, a musical that captures what I believe is the essence of theater. The story and music accentuate the deepest, most soulful human emotions, namely love, jealousy, hatred, fear, lust, and compassion, and wind them into a tragic Gothic love story.  <br /> <br />Phantom also has some comic moments, to ease the tenser moments of the show, or to prepare for some shock, such as the hanging of Bouquet (that's all I'll say on that matter, which is a real shock in the show, and an excellent thrill.) To sum it up, it is a great play. <br /> <br />That said, the musical instigates great expectations for the film. For instance, on the stage the atmosphere is essential to the experience, and it becomes somewhat harder to do this well in a film. Phantom meets this challenge spectacularly, making use of surround sound and special effects to create a very convincing opera house. All in all, Phantom does the stage-to-screen transition well as far as sets and atmosphere. <br /> <br />Phantom is also very faithful to the show. There are only two major changes in the entire movie: First and foremost, there are periodic scenes from the perspective of an older Raoul, shown in black and white. While there is a short appearance by this aged man in the opening of the play, the scenes from then on draw from the plot of the original novel combined with the subplots of the play. They are a nice addition in my opinion, as they nicely bridge the gaps that are remedied in the play by a short blackout. The other major difference is the fall of the chandelier in the second act instead of the first. This is, in my opinion, not as detrimental as some say, as the importance of this event is only important in that it happens; the when is not all that important. <br /> <br />Finally, the voices are very well done. Many fans (or \\"phans\\", as they are called on many fan websites) have an undying devotion to the original voices of Sarah Brightman (Christine) and Michael Crawford (The Phantom). Personally, I view this as a so-called \\"acquired taste\\", as I feel that Sarah Brightman has a voice that is not suited for the role of Christine; a wavering, shrill sound that does not convey the purity associated with Christine. And, it makes her difficult to understand. Michael Crawford also has a poor voice for his part; a high tenor that can sometimes sound nasally. This does not suit the Phantom's part as it cannot convey the coflicting emotions that are the soul of the Phantom in the play and movie. I much prefer the voices of Emmy Rosum (Christine in the movie, a soprano with the pure, unwavering voice that I feel is essential for her part) and the bass of Gerard Butler (The Phantom in the movie, whose voice, again, better captures his role than does that of his thespian counterpart). <br /> <br />Overall, this was an excellent movie and a great play, so I feel that it deserves the 5-star rating. <br />
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Robert Zemecki's take on the popular children's classic is a visually stunning and heartwarming tale of faith and belief.  Though the story itself is somewhat thin, the animation is brilliant.  Never has animation seemed so lifelike, with loving detail to character movements and gorgeous alpine scenics.  Tom Hanks lends his brilliant vocal characterizations and physical appearance to several roles, most notably the conductor and the mysterious hobo.  He is of course also the embodiment if not the voice of the hero boy.  The movie's message is clear:  if you believe, then everything is magically possible.  The trip to the North Pole is fraught with misadventures and once there, the magic of the landscape and the North Pole is breathtakingly captured.  Alan Silvestri contributes a fine score even if the BELIEVE song is a little maudlin, but deemed Oscar worthy as performed by Josh Groban.  Nona Gaye also does nice work as the hero girl and Eddie Deezen is a great know it all.  In time, I think this groundbreaking joy will be a Christmas classic.  The whole family should enjoy this one.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This cd is amazing! It completly blew me away. I have listened to it non-stop and it seems to get better everytime, cause you can pick up new things you never heard or understand the last time through. One of the best cds of 2005 by far! I have let some of my friends and family listen to it and after one listening, then all went out and got this amazing record. Amazing cd, check it out for sure!
0440237688|4.0|I liked the book but it took a while for it to get going, to get me interested. It was really confusing at first, but when i started to understand it i really enjoyed reading it. Some parts slightly disturbed me, but i guess thats what made the Giver interesting. Over all i thought the book was really good, well written.  <br />I would suggest it to anybody.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Having grown up in the 80's listening to bands like Depeche Mode I was Excited to hear their latest. Im dissapointed to say this cd sounds sad and old like the bands picture.If you are unsure of what to buy of them I would recomend 'Speak and Spell' from their early years. A more modern suggestion would be Violator.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|This album is the mark of another blues age.  For someone who plays pop, he has clearly showed his roots as a closet blues player!  What makes John such a good guitarist is that he doesn't always have to blow you out of the water with head-heavy licks, which he does do in this album, but rather he shares the soloing with \\"lyrical licks\\" that may not be as fascinating as his hard hitting ones, but they truly give the song a \\"body\\" and its own personality and soul, which you have to respect!  Obviously, Eric Clapton did to invite John to play at his cross roads guitar festival, as well as Double Trouble, the backing group of the late great Stevie Ray Vaughan. <br /> <br />The guy has obviously got the endorsements of the best, how could you see or hear anything other than what the best do? <br /> <br />\\"Bubble Boy\\" may be right about the fact Bramhall II and Mato are better players, but the fact is that outside of Garza's one hit wonder (Heaven),KWS, Lang, and now Mayer hold the public's eye much more than any other younger blues rocker, which would be more instrumental than just being \\"a good guitarist\\" in a \\"blues movement\\".  <br /> <br />The only tiny thing I have against this cd, is that I think the JM3 and Columbia, should have given more thought on a studio album to set up \\"Try!\\" before they let it loose. Having a live CD for a first album is somewhat wierd. Even still, this album is full of its bumps and bruises along with the highs of articulate craftsmanship and excitement not contained by studios; basically all the things associated with live albums.
B000AA305M|4.0|Lyrics are the life blood of any song writer. A simple yet true statement which when you Add David Gray to it becomes obvious that this boy can write.I would put this CD up there with White Ladder.He captures your heart and mind with his lyrics and pulls you into his world or maybe you are seeing your world through his songs. Either way,you will not be dissapointed if you buy this CD as it doesn't even take a second listen to be drawn in.
B000002NFM|5.0|Somewhere and only in 2004 I got this record; since then I've been repeating the some sentence whenever I refer to it - \\"the most outstanding sound I've heard in years\\". <br />My highlights are: Smack My Bitch Up, Breathe, Diesel Power, Funky Shit, Serial Thrilla, Mindfields, Narayan, Firestarter, Climbatize and Fuel My Fire. That's right, all the 10 tracks - not a single moment to rest from all the power and brilliance of \\"The Fat of the Land\\". A prodigious album I believe to figure in all music books from the 90's.
B000002H97|2.0|Metallica may have sold out arenas, had huge \\"pop\\" hits and round the clock MTV airplay with the release of this album, but at what cost? They stopped playing the complex metal of and Justice For All or the balls out thrash of Ride The Lightning or Master of Puppets. Instead we are treated to the asinine nursery rhyme of Enter Sandman and the excreble ballads Nothing Else Matters and the Unforgiven. WTF are ballads doing on a metal album? Some of the other songs rock harder but the tempos are slower, the structures simpler and less interesting than previous albums. Where are the guitar solos? Where are the double bass drums? Where's the thrash? Where is the lyrical and compositional complexity? Metallica used to be like a cup of espresso, but with the black album I have to take No Doz to stay awake for the whole thing. By mixing pop and metal Metallica got huge MTV play, made lots and lots of cash, but they lost me and many of their original fans.<br /><br />Now that said it's not so awful that I'd give it one star. It's a two and a half because some of the songs work, Sad But True for example, but most of this album is a disappointment. It's not metal enough and ultimately I don't like the way this album makes me feel. If you want to hear the real deal get Metallica's first three albums with original bassist Cliff Burton or And Justice For All. I'd skip the rest.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|First off, I'd like to make the statement that, despite what anyone says, this album is NOT for everyone. Also, nothing that I or anyone else says here will affect your feeling about this album; it's a strictly love/hate relationship, as with all 'different' music... there is no partiality. That being said, it's understandable to see where some people who dislike this album are coming from. If you aren't used to TMV, this is not your album. Personally, I had to work up to TMV, it wasn't something I enjoyed immediately, but once you can get your ears around the ideas and techniques of TMV, it's true genius, pure pleasure to listen to. Listening to one song on this album is an injustice; it really cries out to be listened to in it's entirety, and this is how it's meant ot be listened to, not in bits and pieces. In comparison to De-Loused, Frances does not have quite as much catchiness or as many musically difficult lines, but, I feel that the music, viewed as a whole, shows much more thought and depth; instruments seem to almost weave in and out of eachother in some places, creating an almost surreal and mind-numbing effect. The most impressive aspect of this CD, just as in De-Loused, in my opinion, is the flow- from one track to the next, the flow is smooth, lines fade in and out, and guitar effects provide subtle, odd, and sometimes even frightening undertones, while the bass and drum lines are thouroughly supportive of the rest of the band, while maintaining some degree of complexity, especially rhythmically. I feel that De-Loused may have done a better job mending different tracks together than Frances, but Frances is nonetheless brilliant in it's approach to this style.  <br /> <br />As I said before, you will either love or hate this album, depending on what you have listened to in the past, your influences, and your tastes- even the best review can't change that. Love it or hate it, this is TMV, and if you can truly listen to this album thoroughly once, you mayfind it growing on you more and more.
0064407667|4.0|I really did liook. My mother asked me to try to read and it and I tried it and I really did like it. Violet, Clause and Sunny are all three great characters in the novels and this is a great book for many kids to read.  <br /> <br />I really do think that pre-teens would like this book moer than anyone else. I read this book a long time ago and am continuing in the series and really like the way Lemony Snicket writes. \\"The Bad Begining\\" is a greta book but is sad too but that is the way Lemony Snicket writes. Many people like his style and many people do not but I really do think that younger people like it more than older people. <br /> <br />Read the first book and don't stop reading his series of books. I hope my review was helpful to you!
0553801503|5.0|All of the negative reviews for this book boggle me - or rather the dominate reason behind the negativity - that the reviewers favorite character makes too brief an appearance or none at all.  This would make sense to me if The Song of Fire and Ice was about a certain set of characters, but as was made abundantly clear in A Game of Thrones, the Song is the main character, not the people who compose it.  I am surprised that anyone can finish book one, let along three books, without that becoming painfully clear. <br /> <br />This is a wonderfully written book.  Like many I wanted to see more of Arya, Tyrion and Hodor, but any disappointment I feel stems from my desire for instant gratification.  This series is brandy, not tequilla.  Savor it.
B000BP86OG|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />I loved the Darkness' first cd (Permission to Land), so I was hoping for more of the same on this new cd.  The first four songs on this new cd continue in the same vein, more or less, as the songs on \\"Permission to Land\\".  But then things get very schizophrenic.  From the fifth song on, the new cd seems to lose momentum, or the momentum changes.  What the last half of the cd sounds like is nothing so much as a collection of stylistically diverse  B-sides/bonus tracks, most very good, some not.  Track five is over-produced with a string section nearly drowning out the band.<br /><br />The last half of the cd is pretty enjoyable overall.  It's just a more uneven listen than the first four tracks, which flow together seamlessly.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Before you buy into the bad reviews of this album, let's take a look at some of the negative comments that people have left (and these are actual quotes from other reviews). <br /> <br />-was dissappointed considering what she has come up with in the passed. <br /> <br />-This album, like all the rest of her albums, is a chaep rip off. She aint pretty... <br /> <br />-I can't imaging why people think this is good music. <br /> <br />Note: I did not correct their obvious spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. These are not the brightest bunch of people as you can tell. Another interesting aspect of some of the one star reviews is the way that they blatantly contradict themselves. They begin by saying that the album is worthless but then go on to say such things like: <br /> <br />-Do yourself a favor and download \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Sorry\\", and \\"Jump\\" from Napster <br /> <br />What? Don't believe Teamlamb or the uneducated fools who like to trash people because they \\"ain't pretty.\\" If this album was lacking, it wouldn't STILL be number one in the US.  <br /> <br />Make up your own mind but something tells me, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B00062IDCO|4.0|I've never been a fan of any Star Trek series finale episode.  They just never live up to what you expect them to be, and this series' final episode was very weak.  Overall, the seventh season was one of the weakest since seasons 2 and 3.  They tried too hard to tie up loose ends and made a pathetic attempt at pushing two of the characters into a romantic relationship.  They even managed to misuse one of the most interesting recent character creations, The Borg Queen.  They did manage to get Alice Krige of \\"First Contact\\" to reprise her role, but she was sadly under-used.  You have to watch this set to see how it all ends, but it's certainly nothing special.
0446677450|1.0|I would say an emphatic no. He bases his book off of the notion that he learned from his \\"Rich Dad\\", who happens to not exist, who taught him everything about making money. Then he went off to fly a helicopter in Vietnam, and made some nonsense up about not wanting to do the governments bidding and kill an unarmed Vietnamese child in his helicopter (which would not only be murder but against the Geneva convention), how he purposefully deserted, (which is punishable by court marshal), then came back and went bankrupt (which, by the way, shouldn't have happened if his rich dad had taught him, as he said, how to make money and thus the basis for the book, since, after all, it was 30 years after he was taught how to make money; additionally, there is no public record of Kiyosaki ever filing for bankruptcy, which is yet another lie to make him seem better than he is). I could go on and on about all of the stuff that Kioyasaki made up (such as the houses that he says he has purchased, of which there are no records) or about the notions he is preaching (such as, take information from a friend or broker who has inside knowledge of a new product to be released, which would be insider trading and punishable with a fine and prison; he also says that that is what friends are for, so that you can profit).    Kiyosaki writes about commonsense notions that your parents and society have already taught you, and then he tries to take the credit for it. It is unbelievable that he is preaching a story that is completely false. So then where does this leave his supporters? They, obviously, will start spouting that he is inspirational and that he makes them think about their finances. Your monthly bills should make you think about your finances, not some fictional book created by a bankrupt fool claiming to be worth anywhere between fifty to a hundred million. Yep, that's right, and Kiyosaki says it varies each day, so as Reed (follow his link in the first spotlight review) points out, Kiyosaki has all his wealth invested in something that could either double or be cut in half in 24 hours? Who in their right mind would ever invest their livelihood in something so potentially disastrous? And this is the man that is inspirational, who makes you think about your finances?     Kiyosaki is nothing more than a dupe preying on the hopes and expectations of the mindless multitudes, making money off a book that had only one good attribute, which was how it was marketed. Read Reed's website, he does way more research about Rich Dad Poor Dad than Kiyosaki did himself.     Wouldn't we rather learn from someone who has actually done something, who has actually applied a method and made money, rather than take the word and advice of a man who has not only made the whole sordid story up but is also preaching stuff that can get you in jail? I know I would, and I am glad that I have come upon the truth and know Kiyosaki for a fraud. Don't slam me for what I say, do a little research and compare this to what Kiyosaki is saying and come to your own conclusion. It will undoubtedly be to turn to more solid and forthcoming advice.
B000BGH22W|2.0|Fine in the film...bland on CD.  Divorced from the film, Patrick Doyle's score simply cannot touch the sense of wonder, anticipation & magic that John Williams pours into the previous three scores.  It's just is not very interesting to listen to on it's own.  I guess that's the difference between good and great.
B00008A7QK|5.0|T-Rex is the definitive 1970's glam-rock band. Electric Warrior features most of the most memorable tracks of T Rex including 'Cosmic Dancer', 'Get it on', 'planet queen', 'hot love', and 'Girl'. I would recommend this one along with David Bowie's 'Ziggy Stardust' as a good place to start in the genre of glam-rock. The music is a strange blend of simple riffs, mythically tinged lyrics, and interesting production. Truly a strange and beautiful album.
B00005V4O5|5.0|My favourite Pain of Salvation album, also my favourite album of all time. Remedy Lane is dark, emotive, beautiful, dealing with subjects such as suicide, love, despair, miscarriage, and a trip into a painful past. <br /> <br />Why is it my favourite? First, the production is great. No more muddy tones such as in Perfect Element I. Second, the humanity of the subjects clicks with me very well. Don't get me wrong. 'Be' is good as a philosophical piece, but Remedy Lane's lyrical subjects, music strikes the deeper (and deepest chord) compared to all of their other albums. <br /> <br />Let me touch on Gildenlow. Amazing singer, truly unique, and the only singer I have ever heard to truly use his voice as an instrument. The weird sounds he makes, as mentioned by another reviewer, just enhances Remedy Lane for me. He is on top form here, and backed by an excellent vocalist with complex, deep and stirring music - How could Remedy Lane be anything short of a masterpiece?
B000BISBDY|4.0|Heres the thing. This one is obviously out now to ride on the tail of the movie, (you can also buy it together with the soundtrack to WALK THE LINE at a reduced price). Ok, I won't knock it, its a decent collection. There are fifteen billion Johnny Cash collections, I have never been satisfied with ANY of them. I feel that this misses a lot, but it does hold a tight collection of good songs.<br />THIS particular collection starts off the same way every single other one does, with CRY CRY CRY and HEY PORTER. These songs well maybe were the first singles back in the mid fifties, they are both sort of weak. We are trying to span fifty years of music... do we need both of these early songs? The rest is pretty much like every other hits package too which I guess is ok. UNDERSTAND YOUR MAN always seems to miss the cut on these things... I don't know why. It's one of his greatest for sure. This thing is better than say, ESSENTIAL JOHNNY CASH.. which I bought back when the man was still alive and was severely dissapointed with. I like ONE PIECE AT A TIME but it gets old after one or two listens.. and we take a pretty large leap in time between that song and HIGHWAYMAN, which is only like 30% CASH by the way, It's way more Willie Nelson. This must be so we can leave space for the U2 cover which is absolute crud. I'm happy to see DELIA though, and the MAN COMES AROUND is another welcome addition. I also realize that HURT is now an essential. I'm also glad they left out WONT BACK DOWN because that was a pretty terrible outing from his most recent years. I don't know, I guess its a good compilation. Personally the FOLSOM PRISON and SAN QUINTEN albums are pretty much all the essential material for me. It would take you years to get all the hits compiled here on their proper albums... and you just want a couple songs to keep the buzz going from the movie.  So get this one.
B00005JNTX|2.0|So I saw \\"Sin City\\"; another in a long line of films that look good, but aren't good. Yeah, I know there are sexy women and lots of nudity, but for these types of films a story would be nice. And while I respect Frank Miller as an artist, I am not really a fan of his work. Also, Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have done much better in the past. See \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" for what I mean.<br /><br />I used to really respect Rodriguez as a director, but ever since he got caught up in the 3-D craze, he really hasn't made anything that has excited me since \\"Spy Kids 2\\". I'm referring to \\"Spy Kids 3\\" and \\"Sharkboy and Lavagirl\\". Even his standard films like \\"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\\" have suffered.<br /><br />Rodriguez is currently working on a sequel to \\"Sin City\\". I can hardly wait (sarcasm).
B000BJS4OY|5.0|The important thing about this disc set is the Hammersmith Odeon Concert DVD. It was the first concert outside the US for Bruce and the band and you call feel the nervous energy when they enter the stage. They rise to the occasion. A great peformance. Brilliant playing by all bandmembers. Crystal clear sound. Excellent selection of songs. For some reason the people that were there that night spread the word that it was an off night for Bruce. This film proves them wrong. The documentary is ok. The remastered Born To Run album sounds better than the original, so I guess the remastering is done properly.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Muscially speaking, this album is the strongest recording Black Sabbath released after the Ozzy/Dio eras (and better than some of those albums, too).  Tony Iommi is the master of those dark, pummeling, sludgey guitar riffs.  Headless Cross is, musically, arguably the best example of that guitar sound that is a trademark of the Sabbath sound.  The keyboards are more prominent here than on other Black Sabbath discs but that's not a bad thing - in this case, I thought the keyboards really enhanced the music on this.    The album begins with the haunting keyboards that is a prelude to the heavy, slow-paced title track.  Devil and Daughter is another GREAT, upbeat riff that is perfectly complimented with the keyboard work of Geoff Nicholls (why was that musician rarely tabbed as an official member of Sabbath?).  When Death Calls starts off slowly with the emphasis on atmosphereic keyboards and a simple guitar melody and BOOM! - another heavy riff and operatic Martin vocals - finishes out as another upbeat track though not quite the way Devil and Daughter does.   Most of the other tracks have good riffs and that dark, heavy guitar sound that are some of Iommi's best musical efforts.    Tony Martin is a great singer.  Black Sabbath does not begin and end with Ozzy or Dio on vocals.  Iommi is the heart and soul of Black Sabbath. Laurence Cottle's bass work is excellent on Headless Cross, and he sounds very similar in style to Geezer Butler.  Cozy Powell is one of the greatest drummers of all time, and his contributions here in terms of production and drumming really helped Black Sabbath regain some status they had lost as the band had really become a Tony Iommi solo project with the guitarist as the sole original member.    My high rating for this album of for the music ONLY.  Occultish lyrics have been another Sabbath trademark, and I would personally prefer to have had the band record this fine piece of music without Satan and his cronies getting a namecheck on almost every song.  But musically, the instrumentation on this is great.
B000BYA5GO|1.0|Not a bad movie, but watch \\"Deal of the Century\\", a much better movie about and funnier.
0780020685|5.0|This is my favorite movie. Ive seen it dozens of times and I still am enthralled with each reviewing. Thanks Akira for a lifetime (55 years anyway) of enjoyment.
0141439661|5.0|I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and this my second favorite, after Pride and Prejudice.  I've heard from others that they found the language used in this book hard to understand.  I didn't have any problems but this was not my first J.A. novel.  These books aren't for everyone but I definitely recommend at least giving them a try.
B0007CNXUK|2.0|...he was reacting to the current theatrical scene in London. He was tired of writing melodramatic, chauvinist, manipulative, and overly-sentimental plays. PETER PAN was brilliant and revolutionary because it was fantastic, escapist and playful. Unfortunately this film is almost EXACTLY what Barrie deplored! It is melodramatic, predictable, chauvinist, and maudlin. The acting is quite good, but Depp has done similiar work far too many times. He is a terrific actor but he should explore new territory.  <br /> <br />One scene does stand out: the creation of PETER PAN on stage. The audience's reaction tells all: they are either astounded, reviled, but never unmoved.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|I was looking through a few of the reviews here, and I found them halarious.  Most of it is like a personal vendeta against the guy (john mayer), I could bet money on it, that 60% of these clowns haven't even listened to the cd, they just hate him so much, that they needed this \\"amazon review station\\" to let loose of their feelings...talk to someone who cares, and get a hug from someone perhaps, other than that, let these kind people review the disc with some thought and brain. <br /> <br />Personally, I thought this was a average disc.  This is definitely a step in the right direction for the man though.  I would say there is much better to come in the future.  With his talents on the guitar, and a good backup band (like his current one) he will be able to expand his music to something worth listening to, for the pop crowds, and music lovers alike. <br /> <br />I would say though buy it if you are a john mayer fan, it will be very likable.  If you are a newcomer to his music, download it first, and see what you think....because in the long run, its all about your own opinion...not mine.
B0000025YW|5.0|One of the best metal cd's of all time.  If you like 80's metal like Iron maiden and Judas Priest, you will not want to miss this one.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.  There is not a bad song on it. This has been a regular in my collection since I heard it in 1984.
0345409671|4.0|Anne takes a reader from Heaven to Hell and everywhere in between in this surprising, and obviously personal tale. Her writing style makes it more than worth reading, and the plot gives any reader something to think about.
0553801503|3.0|Martin has run amok with this one, indulging in his world and character weaving with the intensity of a fetish.  Look, anybody who read the first three books is going to enjoy this one too.  But it is a deeply flawed work. <br /> <br />Nothing happens.  Nothing.  I could tell you everything you need to know about the plot in two sentences.  Most of the book, like the Brienne chapters, have no relation to the overall plot, and are simply tedious. <br /> <br />Worse, this volume lacks the three most interesting aspects of the series -- the best character (Tyrion), the Fire, (Dany), and the Ice (Jon).  It's strictly a sideshow. <br /> <br />Should never have been written, or at least should have been written after the series concludes, as a backstory filler. <br /> <br />As I say, however, no matter how flawed, it's still enjoyable.
1932100385|2.0|Veganism is a wonderful diet, for some people. I was a strict follower of vegetarianism for 10 years and vegan for an extra two years. It was the sickest period of my life. I suffered from physical weakness, acute depression and would suffer colds about 5 times a year. I started a lot of world travelling and found myself needing to eat meat on occasion. I gradually started to introduce meat back into my diet. Suprisingly my health skyrocketed. I rarely feel sad, I have not had a cold in 3 years, and I am stronger and more energetic now at 36 than I was at 26. I know that this comes from eating meat again.  <br />I have learned first hand that one persons perfect diet is another persons recipe for misery. Mr. Campbell should go to Thailand and try to explain why an entire population which consumes a large amount of meat with fresh vegetables remains thin. When I am there I see maybe one out of a thousand people who are overweight. In America it is more like 1 out of 3. The big mistake that these diet books make regardless if it is a vegan book or a meat eaters diet book is that there is no single healthy diet that you can recommend for everybody at all! Different people require different individualized diets. Which would mean that everybody needs their own unique diet book. That is the ultimate truth.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna, Confessions On A DanceFloor<br />I must confess - the disco-fied R&B, pop, Euro, and trance beats of Madonna's 14th album, Confessions On A Dancefloor - makes me want to dance. From the adrenaline-drip high on the hit single \\"Hung Up\\" (with samples from Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme\\") to the retro beats of \\"Future Lovers\\" (with samples from Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\"), the all-dance, no-ballad Confessions On A Dancefloor will re-inspire the hustle and bus stop on the dance floor. You can hear Madonna's confessions, and even make your own by [...]
B000BP86OG|4.0|...this cd is more polished than the previous cd...which can sometimes spoil things for rock fans...but over all its a stronger effort than \\"permission to land\\"...I've been purchasing music since 1970 (only back then it was LP's and 8 track tapes) and many of the titles from that era remain fresh and enjoyable 10, 20, even 30 years later. The Darkness seems to be on the same level as some of those artists. I believe their music will stand up to the test of time, which to me is a sign of quality. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoyed their last cd, or to anyone who enjoys good, solid rock music.
B000B8QEZG|2.0|For 20 years now, Madonna has been my favorite artist... I've grown up with her music, and I think she's set the bar in the pop music industry.  I was very excited to hear that the latest release would be an all-dance album because it's always been my favorite side of Madonna -- plus, the club-crowd adores her. After \\"American Life,\\" she really needed to be well-received again in the States.  Although I feel this album does out-shine her previous release, I have to say that the songs on \\"Confessions\\" resonate disappointment more than disco.  Doing an all-dance album was Madonna's chance to define this genre for the entire decade, but unfortunately, the songs just aren't spectacular enough to do that. Sonically, the production is superb and glossy (even if a little too repetitive), but the songwriting on most of these tracks is lackluster.  Aside from a couple of gems like \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Hung Up,\\" these songs aren't all that catchy or memorable like her previous material has been... and some of the lyrics are just terrible (\\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Jump\\" just don't cut it for me).  I *really* wanted to love this album because I have such respect for Madonna, but I just don't find enough material on here to love.  It's not that I hated this album, but I just wanted smarter lyrics, hookier choruses, and more diversified production... An all-dance album doesn't mean that every song has to be overtly electronic, but I guess the days of using real drums, a horn section, and rhythm guitar have been forever replaced with a vocoder, a sampler, and a synthesizer.  My expectations were awfully high, I know... but come on, it's Madonna!  I shouldn't have to lower my expectations.  For me, this album could have been the pinnacle of Madonna's hugely successful career, but instead, I'll keep my fingers crossed that the next album won't stoop to the level of rhyming \\"New York\\" with \\"dork.\\"  SORRY, but you deserve an honest opinion from a very devoted fan.
B000BCKFWK|1.0|This was copiously awful movie; one of worst I've ever seen. I highly advise you to give it a miss. For me the worst part was the dreadful, dreadful waste of talented actors who are forced to speak silly, stilted dialogue amongst overpowering scenery. Truly bad!
015626224X|5.0|a. For those who blame the poor for being where they are. <br /> <br />b. For those who think that an expensive restaurant is, ipso facto, a good restaurant. <br /> <br />c. For anyone who would applaud a bracing, grimly realistic -- but not maudlin -- face-off with the real world of the down and out.  <br /> <br />The true shock is, seventy-two years after the publication of this book, we haven't even tried to solve the problem of poverty. Orwell's idea of having \\"tramps\\" work at farms in exchange for nutritious food is still a great one.

B0009W5JS2|2.0|This has to be the most stupid movie I have watched for a long, long time. I'd be here all night pointing out plot holes and the stupidity of it. If a train is going in a straight line at 150mph, is it possible for a car doing less than that through city streets and traffic to gain and catch the train? In another scene Ice Cube's left arm catches fire, then the flames are put out and the burns are on his right arm. I could go on and on but it's been said in other reviews before me. Your IQ will literally half while watching this mess. At times I didn't know what movie I was watching as the movie rips of scenes from The Fast And The Furious, GoldenEye, Under Siege, Under Siege 2, Octopussy and Mission Impossible to name but a few. I'd rather have my balls sandpapered raw for 90 minutes than have to watch the insulting stupidity that was this movie again. One star because I have to and one star because people should be rewarded for effort.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|This set costs more than it would to buy each season individually. Why, Amazon, why?  As for the show, it is definitely not my favorite Star Trek, but my mom likes it and the theme song isn't that bad the thousandth time.  Plus it has a dog.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I saw this concert on Vh1 on TV several times. I kept looking up bootleg DVDs of this concert and then I got this on my birthday. But a friend of mine was pretty annoyed by what she saw. What we saw was too many shots of the audience reactions. She thinks MJ's fans are ridiculous like that. Also, Jackson kept on crotch-grabbing which she thinks he went too far. <br /> <br />Also, we saw that several shots were not from Bucharest. I saw London Monza Paris Lausanne Toulouse blah blah. Why couldn't the footage shot be only on Bucharest itself
B000BOH8XW|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time, not just one of the best of the year.  I loved the album the first time I listened to it, it's really that good.  Out of the 11 songs the only one I really don't like is #11 Timor.
0201433079|5.0|This badly needed update to the classic first edition preserves what is best about the old edition, which is the format and attention to detail, and adds the changes that have occurred to the UNIX operating system since the first edition was published back in 1992. Specifically, there are implementation samples for FreeBSD, Linus, and MAC OS X included. This edition is as the first one was, an excellent reference for anyone doing system level programming in C or C++ on the UNIX platform. It is was never intended to teach the reader the fundamentals of the UNIX environment nor to teach C/C++ programming. The author assumes a strong  knowledge of both. The book begins much as the first edition did, by explaining the UNIX kernel in generic terms. It then goes on to explain the various implementations of UNIX and their specific differences. You will find chapters three through ten largely unchanged from the first edition, as the basic mechanisms of file I/O, directory structure, interprocess control, and signaling have not evolved since that time. Chapters eleven and twelve are two new added chapters on threads, as  threading has become very important in UNIX system programming. Also, gone is the chapter on interfacing to a postscript printer. It is replaced by a more modern chapter on communicating with a network printer. The HTTP protocol is discussed in this context. The book contains a rich set of examples and downloadable code that is very useful. In addition, the book contains the implementations of two large-scale projects: a database library and communication with a network printer. Each project includes complete code with schematics. This book also contains numerous exercises, and the solutions to some of those exercises are included in the back of the book. Since Amazon, and some reviewers, show the table of contents for the first edition but not the second, I include that here for the purpose of completeness:<br /><br />1.

B00000I5Y6|5.0|Six shaggy haired men wearing overalls and leather jackets belting out perfectly synchronized harmonies, and strumming powerful guitar and violin chords. Not exactly what you'd expect from the 70's Americana rock group, but for Kansas fans everywhere, it's whom they've come to known and love. The album, \\"The Best of Kansas\\" is a compellation of Kansas' greatest hits remastered like never before. For new fans and old, this album will have you singing along to hits like \\"Dust in the Wind\\" and \\" Carry on Wayward son\\" sooner than you can think. <br /> Kansas' lead vocal Steve Walsh resembles a quieter, softer side of Queen's Freddy Prince. It gives more attitude and more punch to the songs. <br /> My favorite song is actually the poetic and influential \\"Dust in the Wind\\". The acoustics and Walsh's melodic yet subtle voice goes together perfectly. <br /> As for the nine-minute ballads, \\"Song For America\\" and \\"The Pinnacle\\" showcases a wide range of piano in the introduction. However I did think it was a bit long to wait about three minutes before the words start to come on. <br /> The rock guitar riffs come off strongly in songs including, \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" and \\"The Pinnacle\\". <br /> To my surprise, this album gives something to everyone. Old fans get newly remastered songs by Jeff Glixman and Vic Anesini. And new fans get a taste of the legend that is known as Kansas. <br /> The album features 12-chart topping songs span throughout Kansas' career. It is without a doubt that the sensational mixture of classical violins and rock vocals that make Kansas, a staple in Americana Rock history. <br />

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Joss Whedon's space western didn't find a wide audience on televison and was unceremoniously yanked from Fox's lineup despite rock solid writing.  Given the choice to make money or make quality programs, broadcasters logically chose the former.  Fortunately, the story didn't end there for the nomad ship, the Serenity.  The crew and the beloved bucket of bolts they call home, return on the big screen this time.  Malcom Reynolds [Nathan Filton] and his ragtam team of space buccaneers are harboring a pint size weapon in the form of a girl named River [Summer Glau].  She has used her mind reading abilities to inadvertantly garner some secrets that the evil Alliance doesn't want found out.  This leads to deadly entanglements with the Alliance, space cannibals called Reavers and a forgotten planet named Miranda.  Serenity's staff soon learns that the 90 pound waif that has been riding around with them is capable of taking on whole groups of weapon toting henchman by herself without breaking a nail.  You don't need to be a fan of the television series to enjoy this science fiction saga [as of this writing I have yet to see any of the 14 episodes].  The characters are well drawn out and the plot isn't so terribly complicated that you can't figure out the basic details quick enough to keep up with the fast moving script.  The movie has a silly, spaghetti western feel to it that somehow comes across as charming and amusing rather than quirky and annoying.  Comparisons to the Star Wars universe are inevitable, but Serenity doesn't get swallowed up by expectations of grandeur and legacy.  It is free to be razor sharp, witty and simply enjoyable.  At times, the George Lucas films seem to take themselves a little too seriously.  That is never a problem with Serenity.  Joss Whedon manages a near perfect balance between serious action sequences and humor.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It was well worth the wait. It seems that Coldplay wasn't that popular when Rush of Blood and Parachutes were out, and now all of a sudden they are all the rage and I'm happy about they. It hasn't gone to their head and you can see that in the music. Although it is not as strong as Rush of Blood (nothing could top it), it has many strong songs and runs nicely.  <br />It opens with Square One, a three part song which samples all parts of the album. They have some of their great ballads, What If and A Message which will never get old, another Clocks, Speed of Sound, and some great suprises like White Shadows, Talk, and The Hardest Part. The album's great, but the best part of it is Fix You. The thing that is great about Coldplay is their simplicity. The Scientist is and will forever be my favorite song in the world, but Fix You close up there with it. It is split into two parts, the slow and the fast, showing both sides of the bands music, and for something new, they threw in 4 part harmony which makes the song. Their voices combined along with Jonny's guitar playing make it the best song on the album, and it never gets old. While their last album was flawless this one is close behind.
B00005JO1J|5.0|I was born to love \\"Rent.\\"  Having grown up listening to my mother's record of \\"La Boheme\\" playing as she did her housework, I anxiously anticipated seeing the Broadway production when I was in New York in 1999.  Although, it was superb, the movie version was so much more enjoyable to me, mainly because the words to the beautiful songs were clear and much more understandable.  I realize Broadway is a one-shot deal and a movie can have countless takes on a scene, so I'm not putting down the play I loved in any way, just saying the movie was an easier and more enjoyable viewing experience.<br /><br />From the spectacular opening scene where the full cast sings the beautiful \\"Seasons of Love,\\" the stage is set for a glorious celebration of life, living it to the fullest, and enjoying every moment.  Yes, there is heartbreak on the screen and many moist eyes in the theater, but this is mainly a joyful story of friendship, love, and reaching out to your fellow man.<br /><br />The acting is superb, lovingly done by actors who obviously relate to their roles in a profound way.  Wilson Jermaine excels as Angel, especially in the show-stopping \\"Today 4 U.\\"  Adam Pascal and Rosario Dawson are believable as the romantic leads and Jesse L. Martin will astound his \\"Law and Order\\" fans with his rich singing voice and dancing ability.  All the cast is marvelous, the show is electric with its high-energy singing and dancing, and overall, the best movie I have seen in a long, long time.  I will definitely get the DVD the day it is available.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|The \\"Wicked\\" Original Broadway Cast recording sparkles with energy and emotion, and features the original performers for whom the music was specifically written.  The musical version of \\"Wicked\\" differs substantially from the original novel by Gregory Maguire but the altered storyline, in which the minor character of Glinda the Good in the novel is elevated to co-star status in the musical, becomes a story of the friendship between two young women and the sacrifices they must make to be true to their ideals.   <br /> <br />While this makes the musical story completely different than the book it is arguably more compelling than the actual novel, as evidenced by the show's runaway success on Broadway, Chicago and on national tour.  Add composer Stephen Schwartz's best work since \\"Pippen\\" 30 years ago and the result is a show that IMO is easily as enjoyable as \\"Les Miserables\\" and far more gripping than \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" or \\"Miss Saigon.\\"   <br /> <br />Schwartz introduces the dramatic \\"Wicked Witch\\" theme (a six chord progression whose unspoken lyrics purportedly are \\"oh no, the witch is here\\") in the first moments of the overture and recalls it chillingly again moments later when it becomes apparent at the Wicked Witch's birth that something is horribly wrong.  Then, when the young Witch is finally united with her true love in the second act, the love theme utilizes the exact same chord progression, but now set in a compelling ostinato figure that underscores the urgency and desperation of their fleeting moment together.  The Hindemith-like antiphony of \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" both jars us and serves to clue us into realizing that something's not quite right during the \\"Ding-Dong the Witch is Dead\\"-like opening celebration number. <br /> <br />The hopeful yet tragic \\"Unlimited\\" theme arcs through the story and is a clever homage to the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" movie score, using the same first seven notes as \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" and then diverging.  Schwartz noted in interviews that he chose to use only the first seven notes as an inside joke because copyright laws specifically define eight notes as the point where infringement on someone else's tune occurs.   <br /> <br />The music of \\"Wicked\\" is for the most part completely dependent on the context of the musical and the individual numbers do not stand alone well, but Ms. Chenowith's \\"Popular\\" and Ms. Menzel's legitimate showstopper \\"Defying Gravity\\" are justifiably acclaimed, and the de facto finale \\"For Good\\" is already available on Amazon on two other non-Broadway recordings, one of which features the composer singing half of the duet himself.   <br /> <br />The aforementioned love song \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" also has to be heard in the context of the story to be fully appreciated; the audience at this point in the musical has been taken on a journey from the apparent celebration of the witch's demise at the beginning to the show 180 degrees to where we now understand her character and motivations to where from \\"Defying Gravity\\" onwards we are actually cheering for the witch to succeed; by the time this duet comes along near the end of the second act, the witch and her true love are being hunted across the land and we already know that our heroine is doomed to melt (and soon!) at the hands of a certain Kansas farmgirl, lending the lyrics and chord progressions, maudlin at best out of context, tremendous pathos and power akin to \\"The Fall of Saigon\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World\\" in \\"Miss Saigon.\\"  Only when you see the musical do you understand why Schwartz chose Fiyero's otherwise jarring verse \\"Maybe I'm brainless, maybe I'm wise.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Wicked\\" is well worth your time but you'll enjoy it infinitely more once you also see the show, and the show itself is well worth a weekend trip to the nearest city staging a production to see it.

6305428042|4.0|I remember seeing this movie in theatres when I was in third grade. I love, love, loved it. It seemed to be forever before it was finally released on video! Now, being older, I have the DVD -but, as we have been spoiled so often, I feel cheated without any bonus features at all! And I clearly remember, from previews that still lurk in my mind, that there were a lot of deleted scenes from this film -including the witches going to a super market among others. Come on, Disney!...why the hold? <br /> <br />I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie and my sister was 8. We handled it extremely well then. I don't think children of today would have a problem at all with this movie. Of course, it's probably best at Halloween!
B00000DHZJ|4.0|It is clear that Hendrix is a classic great of rock music, with the likes of the Who, Beatles, Stones, Kinks, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath. Any best of collection is worthwhile. Enough said. It is nice that we have this free forum to voice our praise, or criticism of products. Unfortunately, it is open to the illiterate burgers, to voice completely useless and crass opinions. But at least adding ridiculous discrminations, such as that of the NYC gay disco fad Scissor Sisters in favor of a modern music ICON such as Pink Floyd, shows the mindset.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|What the heck hapened to the blues? I was raised on them, and I always thought it would be around. I was wrong. The best way to describe this album is LAME. I'm all about an artist growing. I really enjoy that part of music. I have enjoyed seeing where Johnny Lang is going. However, this isn't growth, it's regression. If this was a demo tape, no one would listen past the first 5 seconds. Where's the heart? the passion? Am I the only one who needs this in their music?
B00005NC66|5.0|First, I must say I enjoy these types of movies.  Characters who are living on the edge of society, almost oblivious to it.  That obviously says something about me, the viewer, the interpreter.  It also says something about how I view reality.  As Marx noted, humans are self-interested creatures at the core.  The rest is constructed fluff.  This movie, for me, flows along that premise.  Second, I had read nothing on this film until after I saw it a couple days ago.  I knew Jean-Luc Godard was a very influential filmmaker, but little about this film itself.  When I first saw the jump cuts I thought, \\"what the h&*@?\\"  Others say those were political comments, revolutionary, forced, or just plain amateurish.  What Roger Ebert conveys is Godard had to cut 30 minutes of film, so he went through and cut out anything he found boring.  Sounds logical.  This led to the final product, which includes the jump cuts.  Well, I think as a style it ends up working.  This is a \\"rough\\" film about an \\"amateur\\" criminal.  Perhaps along its core is a universal political statement about social authority and the individual reactions to it.  In the movie people die, and they die through the unpolished style of the main character, who simply lives how he chooses.    Third, to me, the camera work, the acting, the script, all flow seemingly into a very stylized film that pays homage to the petty crime drama genre.  In a way it is Reservoir Dogs before Reservoir Dogs.  But it is also more.  It tells the truth about love.  Love isn't as simple as meeting somebody, sleeping with them, marrying them, having children, aging, and dying.  Love, like life, is beautiful but messy.  This film matches love and life perfectly.  Just as amazingly, like the other film I mentioned, it manages to remain \\"on the fringe\\" of cinema while reinventing the industry in an important way and becoming a topic in mainstream discussions about film making.  Certainly we have moved on.  Breathless is not the only great movie ever made.  There are movies made today that may even be its equal.  Breathless becomes immortal, then dies.
B000BKJ78U|5.0|It's amusing (yet tiring) to read \\"reviews\\" of a product that turn out to be nothing but a soapbox for disgruntled sci-fi nerds. If you enjoyed the 1997 revised versions of the original trilogy, then you will enjoy these DVDs. If you hated the new movies, you will hate the DVDs. The simple fact that so many people seem to be missing is that regardless of whether or not you feel \\"betrayed\\" by George Lucas, the man created the Star Wars universe and can do with it as he pleases. Threatening a man who has over $300 million with the fact that he \\"won't get a nickel from me\\" is sad and pathetic. Fortunately, in this capitalistic nation of ours, nobody will show up at your door to put a gun to your head and force you to buy it. Please stop wasting review space with juvenile lamentations and log on to your nearest star wars blog or news group to dispense your woes.
B000006045|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best Massive Attack album.  Here, they really hit their stride blending tip-hop with electronic music into a wonderful blend that is so powerful, it is unforgettable.  Features so many great songs: Anel, Rissingson, Teardrop and the great title track, Mezzanine.  Get this!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Kudos to John Mayer... instead of churning out another pop album (which would probably give him another Grammy nod), he does what he wants to do, aligning himself with two of the best in the business (Steve Jordan and Pino Palladino).   <br /> <br />John shows us nuances of what he can do on guitar... but I can't say there's ever a track where he \\"lets it all go.\\"  A few times while I was listening to the album, I felt that the song deserved a little more \\"tasty\\" solo than the one that John chose for the particular song.  Nevertheless, he sings and plays with a lot of emotion... emotion which isn't depicted as well because of the recording quality, but I will get to that in a minute.  John seems like he is really enjoying himself on stage.  I applaud his choice to avoid many of his hits, instead focusing on the trio's original songs, cover tunes, and some other songs he has written.  His version of \\"Something's Missing\\" is extremely good, particularly with Jordan and Palladino's excellent playing on it.  As for \\"Daughters,\\" it just didn't fit; it seems like it was just thrown in as a chance for the 15-year-old girls to scream. <br /> <br />Now for the recording quality... it seems as if no editing or mixing was done whatsoever.  It seems as if my buddy went down to the club, recorded the band with a tape recorder, and burned me a copy.  I suppose the band was trying for the ultimate \\"live\\" album; the cd liner basically brags about its \\"raw\\" nature.  The quality takes away from the album, to say the least. <br /> <br />This isn't your kid sister's Mayer album... this shows a little of what Mayer can do.  It's obvious that Mayer has recently been reinventing himself as a Rock/Blues player who also sings, rather than a singer who just so happens to be a wonderful guitarist.  I'd love to hear a studio effort from these guys... I think we haven't even seen the best of John Mayer yet.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a fun must have dance CD. <br />PS It's even better CRANKED up.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|I loved the movie. <br /> <br />BUT.....!!!!!!! <br /> <br />I am so mad at the studio for being so greedy that they released a first dvd with NO EXTRAS on it and then six months later release the 2 disc edition. I'm not even sure if I want to buy it now.
B0001OOUEM|5.0|In this brilliant, poignant novel, Michael Cunningham captures the lives of three remarkable women going about an ordinary day, much as Virginia Woolf did in \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" In the first section, Woolf is planning the aforementioned novel and dealing with an impendinig migraine, that often brings suicidal thoughts, as well. In the second, Clarissa, a housewife, is planning a party for her poet friend who has AIDS, Richard, with her partner Sally. In the third, Laura Brown, also a housewife in the Forties, and mother of Richard is planning a party for her husband, but resents the time it take away from reading her her novel \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" With evocative prose, the author goes inside each woman's mind, and the results are unforgettable. <br />
B000006YMP|1.0|I don't know why this inferior version is still listed--and is more money than the remastered re-issue with 5 bonus tracks. Amazon failed to list those tracks, but I've done so in a review for that version.
0920668372|5.0|I never read this book to my children.  I didn't even know it existed until my son bought it for ME.  It was a birthday present and has sat on the table next to bed since he gave it to me.  To me it was a statement of love from him telling me he will always love and care for me, just as I will always love and care for him.  He is 30 now and I love the book just as much as I did the day he gave it to me when he was a lowly college student.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|This DVD is presented in a 16:9 aspect ratio,not 4:3 that is listed on the back of the box and this is the US version
B000BJS4SU|1.0|i want to second the idea that a lot of reviewers noted; mayer has no original style whatsoever. Its all a lot of copped SRV and Jimi Hendrix riffs (there are others he rips off , but ill leave it at those two for example purposes). Its one thing to want to do a blues album cause you love the music, its another thing to put another generic blues album out there that does nothing but slap history in the face and also does nothing to move the genre forward in any way. And a little humbleness huh john? You arent the best guitar player in the world (not even close) , and you never will be .... so quit acting like you are.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|This is one of those movies I watch every Christmas.  Definitely a classic and worth your money.  You won't be disappointed!
B000AP04FG|3.0|I avoided this movie in theatres because of all the Brad Pitt/Angelina Jollie tabloid crap.  I saw them on five different magazines every day, and every week a new one with similar picture on each cover, so I had no desire to shell out 9 bucks to see them smirk at one another for two hours.  These are two \\"actors\\" I never much respected anyway.   <br /> <br />Plus the movie looked really dumb.   <br /> <br />But removed from all that sickness, after checking it out at home a few months later, I would never call it a great movie and technically, yep, its pretty dumb, but it has moments and I have to admit the stars are likeable in spite of their constant public over-saturation.   <br /> <br />He's a spy/killer, she's a spy/killer, and they are married, but he doesn't know what she does and she doesn't know what he does (riiiiight), but 5 years into their marriage, one day they put two and two together (the same day, at the same time.... after 5 years - again, riiiiight) and on this day so do the different contacting agencies they work for.  So now they have to kill each other, or get taken out by their respective employers.  <br /> <br />(It took the geniuses in intelligence at those firms five years to figure out they were married?  You'd think you'd know all there is to know about your super-spy employees before you entrust them with government secrets or worse; and what's with them all suddenly getting a clue at the same time?)   <br /> <br />At first they are content to kill each other (each had been treating the marriage as a cover story so no real feeling should exist) and this results in some humorous banter and husband on wife and vise-versa beatings (if that's your bag), but wouldn't ya know they actually do love each other (an epiphany that is awakened after beating the crap out of each other turns them on so much that they stop fighting long enough to screw on shards of broken glass) and soon it's them against their agencies.   <br /> <br />SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!! <br /> <br />But true to form those geniuses are pretty easy to beat.  At least that's what the abrupt ending that doesn't explain anything leads us to believe.  So they wiped out the baddies that were after them that night.  Wouldn't they send more the next day?  In the last scene the couple says all is well and they redid the house they blew to sh*t earlier.  So they are living in the same place?  Why wouldn't someone just blow there house up again?   <br /> <br />I'll do it!   <br /> <br />So, yeah, it's that kind of movie.  But I did smile a lot.  The premise, dumb, no scratch that, absolutely impossible as it - I mean this isn't like, 'oh, he couldn't get shot that many times and survive,' or 'he wouldn't survive that fall' - I mean none of this would ever, ever happen - still makes way for lots of clever gags.  Imagine if your significant other was this person and so were you.  The movie plays that to the hilt and is better for it.  If you're going to stray this far from reality and still expect us to care about the characters then you better go for broke and make sure you play every other angle and possibility up as much as you can.  For the most part, this movie takes full advantage.  I liked how they both had guns and bombs hidden all over the house, in places the other doesn't go and when they are fighting against one another, I liked their banter and the way they knew how to get to one another, whether it be because of their training or because they are husband and wife; often the two reasons are one in the same.  And when they join forces there is the predictable power struggle.  There is a scene where they compare body counts the way couples compare their number of sex partners.  And the scenes with their shrink that bookend the film and set the jokey tone are funny.   <br /> <br />Most importantly and most surprisingly the two leads are solid and likeable and that goes a long way in a dumb movie like this.  If we can't buy them and we sure as hell can't buy this premise, then we can't by the movie.  Their characters are a little clichd and under-developed.  She is the by-the-book, team player who is good at throwing knives, while He is the somewhat goofy frat-guy who, judging by the evidence submitted, enjoys kicking people and hitting them with objects he finds around the room.  Hey, one more caricature and they'd be Charlie's Angels!   <br /> <br />There is Vince Vaughn, but he is underused and doesn't appear much in a kick-ass mood.   <br /> <br />Though the movie explores and exploits most of the possible fun scenarios to come out of a situation like this, I would argue the action sequences come up far shorter.  There are really only three, one is a car chase that is not staged with any real zest or originality and is completely sunk by the two leads' constant sarcastic addressing of each other as \\"dear,\\" or \\"honey\\" before giving an instruction or ribbing one another.  We get it, you're a married couple and you are shooting at people!  Shut up and shoot!   <br /> <br />Blame the director.  I know the guy did \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" and that was generaly well-received, but here he has no style and his attempts at it range from shaky camera work when it is not needed (like early scenes with Brangelina in a hotel room) to slow-mo editing and camera twirls as in the generic shoot-out finale.  All the actions scenes are pretty generic.  The car chase I mentioned pales in comparison to not only great film chase sequences, but doesn't have the excitment and inovativeness, or the hard edge of, say freeway chase in \\"Lethal Weapon 4\\" or even the hot, flashy cars and big pile-ups of crash-wizard Michael Bay's \\"Bad Boys II\\" (or any of his films for that matter).  There is just nothing special, unique or exciting going for any of the action in this movie.  It's a shame it didn't try harder.  Those two titles (and many others) are proof you can be a \\"dumb action comedy\\" and still blow audiences away.  <br /> <br />Sozero logic and poor direction sink its chances of being much more than a guilty pleasure.  But thanks to the charismatic leads and some clever bafoonery, it is a pleasure all the same.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Review no. 100. I've said it many times before and I'll say it again, reunions are big these days. However, must admit this is certainly one reunion I never expected to see. I mean a Cream reunion, with all three original members Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. Superb DVD picture quality of the most memorable four night stand event, probably ever to take place. Total of 22 songs on 2 DVD's here. Band sounds better than ever before, even after 37 years since their farewell concert. Most likely because this time they're actually sober. Tunes I could honestly watch like every other night are \\"I'm So Glad\\", \\"Badge\\", \\"Politician\\", \\"Rollin' And Tumblin'\\", \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", \\"White Room\\", \\"Toad\\" and \\"Sunshine For Your Love\\". Happened to notice that they didn't play \\"Strange Brew\\". That's fine. Highly recommended.
B00009V7RF|5.0|WOW!  I kept hearing about it from my sister, and I never gave it much thought.  I recently got ahold of the album after hearing Holiday on a bodyboarding video, and thought it was really cool with the video, I was just straight trippin' off this mix.   <br /> <br />Man, I love these guys.
B00005JKDR|5.0|As a child, who is not fearful of a big, scary monster opening your closet door and eating you alive?  Ironically, these intimidating monsters are more afraid of the children they are scaring than the children are of them. <br /> Pixar's Monsters, Inc., directed by Peter Docter, David Silverman, and Lee Unkrich, puts a spin on the original idea of monsters inside your closet.  I greatly enjoy this comedic movie full of laughs and tears especially because of the characters' qualities and creativity. <br /> In this movie, James P. Sullivan, played by John Goodman, and his sidekick Mike Wazowski, played by Billy Crystal, work at a factory called Monsters Inc. that turns screams into energy.  Everyday life depends on children's hairs standing up in the town of Monstropolis.  One day, James P. Sullivan, the best scarer at this factory, accidentally lets in a little girl that he later name Boo.  Although children are supposed to be toxic and dangerous to monsters, both Mike and James P. Sullivan, nicknamed Sulley, find that no harm comes from these little people.  Boo, played by Mary Gibbs, has now entered a world unfamiliar to her where she poses a great threat.  With her two monster friends, Boo is ready for any problems she might face.   <br /> Because of characters like Boo, Sulley, and Mike, Monsters, Inc. keeps me captivated and emotional.  Anyone can relate Mike's comedic flair, Boo's vivaciousness, or Sulley's friendliness.  Even from the beginning of the movie, Mike wakes up Sulley by saying, \\"Hey, good morning, Monstropolis. It's now five after the hour of 6:00 a.m. in the big monster city. Temperature's a balmy 65 degrees, which is good news for you reptiles, and it looks like it's gonna be a perfect day to maybe, hey, just lie in bed, sleep in, or simply... work out that flab that's hanging over the bed!\\" <br /> In addition, I love the originality that this movie possesses.  I have to give acknowledgment to the writers of this film.  They did a wonderful job of being imaginative, and coming up with such a complex world full of monsters.  I especially like the scene when both Sulley and Mike are in the locker room and Mike asks for \\"odorant.\\"  With his choices of smell being smelly garbage, old dumpster, or wet dog, Mike chooses wet dog, and Sulley responds by saying, \\"stink it up.\\" <br /> Overall, I absolutely love this movie and never get sick of watching it.  I especially like the fact that this movie is fit for the whole family to watch together. <br /> Who knew that to the creatures inside our closets think of us as the monsters that could hurt them with just a single touch?     <br />
0385334176|4.0|It's been probably 15 years since I read any Vonnegut, after a few years when he was all I read, and this was a nice return. While not one of his best works, it's quintessentially Vonnegut\\" Life in Ohio, suicidal mothers, massive destruction and loss of life. No Kilgore Trout though. What I liked the most was how one doctor had proscribed speed to many of the people in town, and how they were all starting to lose it. The doctor's wife, especially, in one scene, tears up a pharmacy wigging out trying to get a refill. Sounds like most of the people I grew up with back in the day.
0553801503|1.0|<br /> <br />Or so I've read here. I am sick of People to use the same old tired arguments here...do any of you read ALL Fantasynovels there are? Then how can you know if 85% of all Fantasynovels are Crap? Huh? I wouldn't even DARE to utter such complete nonsense! I don't have TIME to read every fantasynovel! <br /> <br />And why should we - the Readers - be privileged to read boring filler books? Why should we feel ourselves as mere onlookers? We paid for it, didn't we? We invested time and emotions. There is no such thing as a writer's complete control over his world and his characters...only in meeting with the reader the whole thing starts to live. It is this arrogance that contributed so much to the downfall of so many fantasywriters - they look upon the reader as cattle and even worse the cattle themselves agree to that. What is wrong with you? I wager that most of you have more ideas than the average fantasywriter - yes, even Martin - and still you believe that you amount to nothing? Without the readers there would be no fantasy, period. Without your participation no story would form itself. <br /> <br />Feast for Crows was just bad. Why? It had no structure. That was one of Martin's greatest Assets. He could indeed write novels who had a beginning, a middle and an end...and leave much for later editions in the series. That is an art in itself. Feast for Crows resemblances more a series of short character studies or society study of the world of Westeros. Now answer truthfully...are you all fans of social sciences? Then why don't you read Max Weber, Norbert Elias and instead dive into fantasy novels? Isn't that odd somehow? <br /> <br />A entertaining book has to be gripping. It has to convey Emotions into the reader. It has to better be a very moving experience. It has no other purpose.  <br /> <br />Feast failed in this regard. And you know what? Dance is going to be even worse...because once we reader see Tyrion, Snow and Dany just stumble along like Brienne, Sansa and Cersei illusion will begin to crumble. The worst case scenario? When you people start to write hate reviews in DANCE OF DRAGONS concerning TYRION.  <br />THAT will hurt! <br /> <br />
B000BJS4SU|1.0|Okay, I'm disappointed. Very disappointed. This sounds like it was recorded off the mains. As far as I can tell, there was no post-production, no mix, just a couple mic's stuck hanging from the rafters (at least it's in stereo). The vocals are buried, there's something banging along in the background which sounds like a drum set. Can't really hear a bass at all. Every once in a while John's guitar gets punched a little to make it out of the muddle, but all in all, it's a .. recording effort.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks, but the previews did little to capture my imagination or inspire me.  Had my wife not purchased the DVD for our 2 year old son this past weekend, I would have missed something truly magical. <br /> <br />The story and character development itself is enough to win the film over.  Add to that the spectacular animation and sensational sound effects, it very well may displace some existing Christmas classics. <br /> <br />Our son is content to tirelessly view this film over and over.  That said, I have to admit I'm the one selecting what we watch...   <br /> <br />Polar Express is a must see!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Thanks god Madonna has returned to her dance roots. I put this album in my cd player the day I bought it and I cant pull it out. Its addicitng, its infectious, its pure ecstasy!! Now I can finally forgive her for American Life. This is her best album ever! <br /> <br />Hung Up: If you havnt heard this yet you have probably been hiding under a rock. This pulsing, high energy dance anthem will be stuck in your  head for days. Riding high on an ABBA sample, it will make you jump out of your seat everysingle time! <br /> <br />Get Together: This song is just amazing. Its retro-trance beat takes you away on an E-trip. This song will definatly be one of your favorites. Its mellow but at the same time you can dance like crazy to it! <br /> <br />sorry: This is a great \\"i will survive\\" type song. It has an awsome beat that keeps you on your feat and singin. This song could definatly be a #1 hit, easily! <br /> <br />future lovers: Here the albums slows down and chills out a bit. this is where you start to feel like your on ecstasy. This song takes you to another world. She speaks for the first minute and then its deep pulsing beat hits and you on your feet again. This song would do really well in the clubs. This song si one of the best on the album! <br /> <br />I love new york: This one is great, definatly one of the higher energy fast songs. The only place she faulters is with the lyrics. a first grader could have written them but the music is pure genius. Madonna shows us her goofy side with this song. You will be dancing the whole time! <br /> <br />let it will be: here you can get a breather and chill out a bit. this is more of a trance song. Its not one of the best songs but it really grows on you after a few listens. It sounds like somthing daft punk would do. <br /> <br />Jump: This in my opinion is the best song on the album. It literally makes you want to jump out of your seat!! The beat is pounding and fast, and the electronic noises make this song a definate #1.When this hits radios its going to explode! <br /> <br />how high: This one is a little bit slower than jump but alot more electronic. she sings in a robot voice, which I think is really cool! It has a really good beat. <br /> <br />Isaac: you will either like it or hate it! Its middle eastern sounding but one of her moe deep songs lyrically. I didnt like it at first but it has really grown on me. here the album loses its momentum, its not a dance song by any means. <br /> <br />Push: Watch out! the energy is back, the beat is not quite as fast as the other songs but is pounding and irrisistable! defiantly one of the best on the album. It has a sting sample which is fun. this song sounds kinda like a britney spears or kylie minogue song. Its awsome! <br /> <br />Like it or not: here the album slows down and stops. Not one of the best songs musically but lyrically its the best. The beat is slow and you cannot dance to it. It would have been better on american life. Its to acoustic for a dance album, but Its a really good song. <br /> <br />  This album may sound a little monotone at first but trust me after a few listens each song takes on its own character. ALL the songs are mixed together like a dj set so its perfect for any party!! I encourage everyone even non madonna fans to grab this album!
B000BHN7DE|4.0|Foreign to most Americans (although known for her breat cancer triumph), Anastacia is a SUPERSTAR across the pond and into the mountains.  Amassing herself a sizable catalog of hits, 2005 is the time for a required collected works to hit distant shores.  And the result?  Pretty darn good. <br /> <br />Opening with the soaring \\"I'm Outta Love\\", the tracks the precede in the order they were released.  Most the material off the \\"Not that Kind\\" and \\"Freak Of Nature\\" is typical girl with big voice material.  The outstanding expections are the unreal \\"One Day In Your Life\\", \\"Cowboy's And Kisses\\", and \\"You'll Never Stand Alone\\" (presented here in it's richer, more complex US release reworked mix).   <br /> <br />Beginning with \\"Left Outside Alone\\" and straight through the closing notes of the album we are given some truly great, amazing, and inspired music.  \\"Anastacia\\" (the album) finally has Ms. Stacia rockin her true voice.  It's a true shame that album has failed to surface domestically. Given the climate of girl rock and heavy lyrics the album could finally give Anastacia some major hits on US charts.  And what about these new songs?  \\"In Your Eyes\\" is a competent rock ballad, but hold on to your seats for the collection's true gem, \\"Pieces Of A Dream\\".  A deep, rich, and challenging ballad that fits Anastacia's voice and latest sounds perfectly.  Almost sounding like a throw away from \\"Anastacia\\", this song is no one's sloppy seconds.  The one off track?  The duet with Eros.  He definatley has a market, but this track should have been left off. <br /> <br />Sadly some really amazing tracks were not released as singles; \\"Overdue Goodbye\\", \\"How Come The World Won't Stop\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Rearview, and the beautiful b-sided \\"Underground Army\\" far surpass some of the tunes selected for radio and release.  But ulitmately this is a singles release and present the artist's best known tracks. <br /> <br />The \\"special edition\\" comes with a bonus remix disc featuring a collection ofdance mixes.  It's truly genuis idea that is a welcome choice from the ever popular additional DVD that is popping up everywhere.  Most of the tracks have had releases elsewhere, but for US fans it's a great chance to get them all in one spot without have to search.  Some tunes are repeated and having rarities (b-sides and rare mixes) would have made this disc truly amazing. <br /> <br />The packaging also deserves a nod.  The designers really rocked out and made this release memorable.  The CD's are house inside the inner sleeves or a little hardcover book (the album cover is still intact and looks breathtaking).  The pages of the book feature the photos apparently taken for the since cancelled US release of \\"Anastacia\\" and re-shot \\"Left Outside Alone\\" video.  The full lyrics and credits are included on the high glass, glossy stock paper.  The CD's are a bit hard to get out of the sleeve and can become scratched easily if not handled with a little TLC.  So be careful with this one!!  <br /> <br />The final product is a great one.  Anastacia is an amazing singer/songwriter with a great collection of hits to draw from.  In the season of \\"best of/greatest hits\\" collections this one is stand out above the rest.
0671027387|4.0|I really enjoyed Deception Point. The story grabbed me, and kept my interest the whole way through. This is my third Dan Brown novel, and I have yet to be disappointed. What is amazing though, is the descriptions of the Spec Ops! To think, we really have these kind of guys working behind the scenes! Amazing! I take on The DaVinci Code next; I already have my paperback version for at home, and the unabridged audio for the drive to work!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|Mariah Carey is the best artist ever created by God. Her voice is incredible!! Any HoneyBFly fan knows Mariah rules!! Madonna is just trying 2 show off. MC will ALWAYS top Madonna no matter what. God Bless You Mariah..I Love EOM Ultra Platinum Edition!!
B000ASATYO|5.0|This film, which didn't get much attention in the theaters, is now finally getting the treatment it deserves since Peter Jackson won his Oscar for Lord of the Rings.  I've always loved this film, and in my opinion, it's far superior to LOTR.  But it isn't overlong, full of excessive dialogue, and based on a classic novel, so I'm sure many will disagree.  But that doesn't matter because in the end this is a fun, scary, clever film that deserves to be seen. <br /> <br />The premise of a man who can see and interact with spirits has been done before.  So what makes this film so unique?  To begin with, the writing.  Ghosts are handled so matter of factly that we are immediately immersed in this strange story of Frank Bannister and the evil Shadow of Death that stalks his hometown.  How do you stop a spirit that you can see but not really touch?  How do you keep it from killing people right in front of you?  That's what Frank has to figure out. <br /> <br />The special effects are amazing.  Death himself is a creepy, flowing predator.  And there are scenes where multiple actions are taking place in multiple levels of reality simultaneously that are directed with jaw dropping skill that keeps them exciting without being confusing. <br /> <br />The story is full of creepy moments, comedy, and twists.  You never know what's going to happen next, but it never seems forced or difficult to follow. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great film that just gets better with age.  See it.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|In combination with the release of their double-DVD Rush in Rio, which documents the final concert of their 2002 Vapor Trails tour, Rush also released a Rush in Rio triple CD as an audio supplement to the DVD visuals. Or, as percussionist Neil Peart so eloquently stated, \\"...for some people (that) might prefer to listen to us without having to look at us...\\"  <br /> <br />Well, after witnessing the DVD video on the big screen and having seen Rush live twice on their latest, and hopefully not final tour, I was really anxious to take in all the nuances of the triple-live CD.  <br /> <br />Now I, like many other Rush fans, were a little surprised that the boys from the great white north were putting out another live album so soon after the last one. In fact, in their 30 year career, Rush followed the pattern of releasing four studio albums, then one live album. That pattern held true up until Rush in Rio which followed after only one studio album since their last live effort, 'Different Stages'. Regardless of this blip in their pattern, Rush in Rio is a very welcomed addition to an ever-growing and magnificent collection of work by these often misunderstood, grossly unappreciated and underrated masterful musicians. Man, say that fast five times! :-)  <br /> <br />Another distinction between this live CD and others released by Rush in the past is the fact that all of the performances, save for two 'bonus' tracks, were all recorded from the single show held in Rio de Janeiro at a stadium packed with 40,000 amazing Brazilian fans. Previous live CDs understandably took the best performances from a variety of venues and dates, all combined to treat the listener to the very best of Rush live.  <br /> <br />However the fact that the entire CD was recorded from a single show makes little difference as the Gods were clearly looking down on Rush that one magical evening in Brazil. Rush, without question, produced arguably one of their finest concerts ever. And what a treat it had to have been for the 40,000 fans to witness, especially since this was the first visit to South America for Rush in their 30+ year history.  <br /> <br />The electricity of that evening translated well into the CD recording. At times, the deafening crowd is so powerful, so vibrant, that they wash over some of the music and vocals. Others complain about this type of 'distraction', but to me, this is a phenomenal way to truly feel like you're there, and not listening to a recording. If anything, I thought that the crowd energy wasn't fully represented on the CD as it was on the DVD. Part of that is certainly due to the visuals of the DVD focusing a lot of its attention on the crowd, where as the CD obviously would not have to live up to that aspect of the presentation. Still, the crowd interaction is quite vibrant and apparent throughout this triple CD, as they should be. After all, this is a LIVE CD. If you didn't want to hear the crowd, then go listen to the studio version :) That being said, I should point out that some songs suffer from washed out vocals more than others. Some adjustments to your system should improve the audio quality and separation, but at first listen, it may be difficult to pick up Geddy's vocals at a few select times.  <br /> <br />As mentioned above, this final show of the 2002 Vapor Trails tour was unquestionably one of the finest performances Rush had ever put forth, but as with all shows, there are always highlights, always particular songs that rise even farther above the bar. There's no shortage of those 'special' songs on this triple CD, but I thought it proper to discuss a few of the very best out of the collection of 30 available tracks.  <br /> <br />First, comes Tom Sawyer; the quintessential Rush song, and the one the boys chose to open up the concert on this tour. The anticipation of the crowd had piqued, so when Rush began playing the opening chords of this 20th century classic, the crowd absolutely erupted. Goose bumps? You bet. Turn this one up loud and become enveloped in the essence of the moment. Absolutely intense.  <br /> <br />Another amazing track comes in the form of YYZ, the superb instrumental that came from the same studio album (Moving Pictures - 1981) as Tom Sawyer. Once again, the crowd exploded with cheers as soon as the first instantly recognizable series of notes echoed out from Neil Peart's drum set. What became even more amazing was the fact that the crowd actually began to sing along to the song. Singing...to an instrumental...! We all hum to songs, but imagine 40,000 fans humming in unison. Simply amazing!  <br /> <br />One of Rush's staples at concerts throughout the years was the fan favorite Closer to the Heart. However for the Vapor Trails tour, Rush decided to retire this little ditty, that is until they went south of the border. They had heard that this was among the all-time favorite songs down south, so they decided to revive it for this special collection of fans. And upon Geddy Lee announcing this to the concert goers, they reacted with extreme appreciation. Having heard this song many times myself (live) and having had it appear on a couple of earlier live compilations, I wasn't expecting anything earth-shattering. But once again, Rush and the 40,000 other stars that night brought the song to new heights, instantly reaffirming what makes it such a popular song 25 years after it was first performed.  <br /> <br />Driven, from Rush's 'Test for Echo' album is just a solid jam, with Geddy at the helm. His spiritual and spontaneous bass rifts drive the scores of people wild. The vocals are spot-on, Alex's powerful guitars are electric (well, duh!) and Neil's heart-pounding punishment of his skins all work perfectly together. What a treat to behold. Perhaps a true candidate for a song that's better in its live format on its studio counterpart.  <br /> <br />O Baterista. Neil Peart. The Drum Solo. Words are completely inadequate in expressing the performance put forth here. Watching the impossible performance on the DVD was surreal. Hearing it again confirms my utter shock that one human being can have such a command over his percussion set up. Have you heard that Neil is regarded as one of the finest drummers of all time? Listen to this solo and hear exactly why.  <br /> <br />All of Disc 3 - every track, including the two 'soundboard' bootlegs are just incredible. A non-stop jam of incredible hits that Rush launches into. The fans go wild, never given a chance to rest after one song before the next is hurled at them at warp speed. Non-stop Rush elation best describes it. And, if you'll pardon the pun (or even if you don't), it's quite a Rush.  <br /> <br />Without question, Rush in Rio in both CD and DVD form should not be missed by any fan of this Canadian trio. And for those of you on the fence, have a listen. You'll be transported to a musical world unlike any other you've ever experienced.  <br /> <br />
B000005EJL|3.0|I came to this album not as a Supertramp fan but as a Mark Hart fan (yes, he has them) following his career after Crowded House.  I don't have the same breadth of knowledge about Supertramp, so I can't play the \\"I miss Roger, and the band is nothing without him\\" game that so many other reviewers seem to be doing. <br /> <br />Being the Mark fan that I am, I immediately focused on the songs that featured his vocals.  \\"Sooner or Later\\" is a great song that has a similar feel to Santana's \\"Oye Como Va\\".  I really like listening to the band members trading licks at the end of the song.  Likewise, I enjoyed \\"Give Me A Chance\\" (the \\"hidden\\" track before C'est What?) as a song featuring Mark.  On the other hand, I took an immediate dislike to \\"Listen to me Please\\" and have only made myself listen to it more because Mark is featured on it. <br /> <br />Hart's voice is good, but some material is not as kind to it as others.  If given the wrong thing, he can sound very whimpy and anonymous.  This album material almost dips into that territory.  To listen to something that does show Mark's strengths both vocally and instrumetally, invest in his solo album Nada Sonata. <br /> <br />Now to the rest.  I'm not much of a jazz fan, so if I don't get excited about what is on the album, that has a lot to do with it.  Also, the white-bread attempts at adding gospel elements just fail miserably.  I do have a few compliments, though. <br /> <br />*Rick Davies sounds his vocal best on \\"Live to Love You,\\" though the song itself is rather bland. <br /> <br />*The bass player, Cliff Hugo, is utterly AMAZING!  If I gained nothing else from following Mark Hart to this project, I learned about Cliff.  I want to hear more of this man's playing, and he is a new inspiration to me in my own playing. <br /> <br />*The same props to the horn section and percussion.  There are quite a few moments on this album where they take the blahs away because of playing so well. <br /> <br />So whatever your Supertramp issues, this is a decent album if taken on its own merits.  You'll like it if you enjoy jazzy elements.  You'll snore if you don't.  The best things about it for me are Mark and Cliff, and the rest is forgettable.
B000000W5L|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Rolling Stones. I own Jump Back: The Best Of the Rolling Stones '71- '93 and 40 Licks. I was going to see them at Fenway Park but couldn't make it. My f@(king clock is The Tounge And Lip Logo, so believe me when I say this is their best album. The opening track \\"Rocks Off\\" is one of their best songs and it has the classics \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and \\"Happy\\". This album could only be better if \\"Sympathy For The Devil\\", \\"( I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\". If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would give it a 10. So I hope you consider getting this album.
B00005JOHI|5.0|I hate to review the movie in such a fashion but invariably as a fan of the TV version, I initially (and errantly) made comparisons to that version and this film version. <br /> <br />Overall, I was rather pleased and surprised by my reaction to this film.  Granted with a listing of solid actors, I did not anticipate it being bad, but instead a bad interpretation of the book (which I have read a couple of times) especially given the time constraints that feature film provides. <br /> <br />While the 1995 TV version is quintessential in its adaptation of the text, the 2005 film version in my humble opinion captures the spirit and the raw emotion that although not on public display must have been in the hearts and minds of the central characters.  I guess this is what many folks consider the \\"modern edge\\" given to this adaptation.  I personally found it refreshing, vibrant and alive. <br /> <br />In terms of casting I must start by saying that I loved Keira Knightley's Lizzie - by far the best interpretation of the role.  And despite those who were blown away by the dashing Colin Firth, Matthew MacFadyen did the role of Darcy service.  His performance wonderfully gives perspective and insight into the perceived fastidiousness of the Darcy persona - I felt like in this version I understood where he is coming from. <br /> <br />Beyond the two leads, all the supporting characters did a wonderful job.  I am almost tempted to go to the theater and see it again it was that good.  Highly recommended to all! <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|This year Rolling Stone came out with the last part of the Immortals. When Guns N' Roses ranked at only 95.), I was upset. They are obviously better than Eminem. But thats dritting away from my point. Guns N' Roses' Appetite For Destruction is an album that proved that titles are stupid. They were called metal, but to quote Joe Perry, They were called metal at the time, but they weren't: Metal isn't sexy, but rock is. They had a deep impact on the face of the Earth, and Appetite For Destruction is the best example of that. Axl Rose has a great scream and a beutiful voice. Slash plays the guitar so well, you would think he's telling it what to sound like. Izzy Stradlin is one of the best rythem guitarists ever and made a awesome solo album. Duff McKagan plays bass so well, you would think the bass loves him. Steve Adler used to be the best drummer of the 80's, until he had a stroke. So please consider this review when you want to buy this album.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|this just bearly made me want to listen to every song. Pretty banal and boring for the most part. Decent guitar work, mediocre songwriting. This jimi cover was nowhere near as good as the original. Worth listening to if you like john mayer and all his ugly facial expressions, but for people who like gritty blues rock this comes off as a tad wimpy.
B000002KIE|5.0|The Sex Pistols are filthy rotters. When they die, they will burn in hell. As a punk, I can say that and that won't be a bad thing. Johnny Rotten is a punk legend and sings like a british demon. Sid Vicous was a wonderful bassist when he wasn't to high to play. Steve Jones is the best punk guitar player other than Ron Asheton. Paul Cook is a drummer with amazing ability. This album should be called Never Mind The Bollucks, Heres The Sex Pistols: The Best Of The Sex Pistols.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Yep..Isaac sucks! It sucks hard! Really not crazy about that song at all. But the rest is top notch. Even if the lyrics are a tad bit cheesy at times. (Check out \\"I Love New York\\"). The music evokes the '70s disco classics. You'll hear snippets of \\"I Feel Love\\" by Donna Summer as well as others.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|of course there are great songs that aren't on this disc but than it wouldn't be called 1. before this,when i was a kid,i had 1967-1970 and was and still is my favorite years from them as well as my favorite collection.yet this still is perfect in that it's the beatles damnit! i don't see how anyone can't like the beatles.i can see someone not liking the bubblegum beginning,but even than they made it work somehow.i can't say what the stand-out tracks are because the whole album,to me,is a stand-out.charting at #1 doesn't prove greatness in my mind because most of the greats never charted. but in the case of the beatles it does mean something in that it's just the icing on the cake.for those who have yet to get into the beatles and want to start than this would be a good starting point,especially for kids.if you are like i used to be in that you only have their albums from revolver on than this probably won't satisfy you,seeing as how the advantage to this is to get the bubblegum hits.oh what the hell, you know that you can't resist.
1400043662|3.0|To begin with a major annoyance, the English translation by Prof. Philip Gabriel of Murakami Haruki's Kafka On the Shore has been excessively \\"britishized\\" for the first Vintage paperback edition. The result is a weird mixture of American syntax and style with British spelling, typography, and vocabulary (mobile phones, lorries, and torches abound). Alas, this mixture isn't just weird and off-putting: it's effectively out-pulling insofar as the translation's constant flow of linguistic inconsistencies pulls you right out of the story, time and again. It's a great example of what I've come to call the \\"Transparency With Birds\\" effect. Meanwhile, Vintage also issued Gabriel's original translation in a \\"reprint\\" paperback edition, so both that and the original hardcover edition are an option.<br /><br />The story itself can wrap you up & take you away, but Kafka on the Shore is certainly not among Haruki's masterpieces. The story lines are excessively opaque and excessively predictable at the same time, the characters at once over- and underdeveloped, and the novel has a Stephen King-ish feeling about it (certain motifs, characters, modes of progression), but without King's knack for weaving even the most outlandish storylines into a gripping and satisfying solution. Not that Kafka On the Shore needed a solution, but it also lacks internal coherence. In the end, too many things and events have not been accounted for, neither in terms of a solution nor in terms of coherence. And certainly not in terms of development: especially Kafka Tamura, the principal character with first-person view (mostly), seems to have ended up right where he started, up to and including his fully intact alter ego that goes by the name of \\"Crow.\\"<br /><br />The story's development, like the characters', is designed to be labyrinthine---a recurrent motif---rather than linear. Only, it's more circular than labyrinthine, on balance. While both the phrases \\"wrong turns must be righted\\" and \\"wrong turns have been righted\\" turn up sufficiently often in the original paperback edition's 615 pages to suggest one must have missed some major plot point or other, it is close to impossible even after attempts at backtracking to pinpoint what wrong turns have been taken when by which characters, let alone righted. That's postmodern, alright. Speaking of which, there's also that typically postmodern mix of ancient archetypes and corporate conspiracy elements, complete with a more than decent load of learned detours into art & culture, but without the tightly controlled over-the-top playfulness of, like, John Barth's or Donald Barthelme's or Robert Coover's fiction. Plus, Murakami's use of feminist characters and corporate icons feels forced, heavy-handed, and artificial. At times, the heavy-handedness even affects his writing technique: the way two pseudo-feminist cardboard characters \\"function\\" to reveal important attributes of another important character's make-up (Oshima) borders on hack work.1<br /><br />But still, Kafka on the Shore is a rich and gripping reading experience. It does expand one's understanding of the world, or at least one's repertoire of questions. But of weaknesses, alas, it has more than its fair share.<br /><br />>> This review has been updated on Dec. 8, 2009.

B00006AW2J|5.0|if not it is still one of the greatest albums of all-time.it's unreal to me that they released this in 1968?! unreal.what a great band and who would have guessed that they'd still be going,especially keith richards?! this album is perfect from beginning to end and a must for stones fans and the like.i've heard that you're either a stones or a beatles fan.well i am definitely a fan of both,as was my mother who passed albums by both of them on to me when i was around 5 years of age,and this was one of them.thanks mom.
B00005B36H|5.0|I'm an avid Maynard fan. I'm eagerly awaiting their newest release set to drop early next year (Maybe January?). Until then, I've finally decided to write an online review for their masterpiece, Lateralus.<br /><br />Its hard to decide if Lateralus is better then Aenima. After each listen, I lean towards Lateralus as being just a complete dream, a euphoric one where I'm complacent and relaxed. Aenima has more edge, and definitley more anger. Lateralus will take you where Aenima and Undertow couldn't. It wasn't their purpose. Right from the start, you are brought into \\"The Grudge.\\" An 8 minute classic that sets the tone for the rest of the disc....at least you think so. The song prepares you for the unknown, because as soon as its over, you drop into the Eon Blue Apocalypse, a minute long transition that sets up \\"The Patient\\" a musical orgasm that you would not have expected. Usually with custom albums, the second song launches you into a different direction. Sticking with Maynard, look at \\"Mer de Noms\\" with The Hollow, followed by Magdalena. Two different approaches to music it seems. But enough about APC, back to Lateralus. The Patient has potential to move you in ways that The Grudge couldn't. Its musically enchanting, and lyrically superior to The Grudge, though by no means \\"better\\" since they are all part of the experience. \\"Mantra\\" carries you over to the first single off of Lateralus.<br /><br />\\"Schism\\" hooks you right from the moment it starts. There is no warning and it just sucks you in. Maynard haunts you here. His voicem, similar to when he begins in \\"The Grudge\\" is very forceful, but delicate. He lets you know that you are in for a ride. You get blasted 3/4 of the way through with the edge that was missing from \\"The Patient.\\" And to make it all the more worth while...it drops off into \\"Parabol.\\" Usually a CD will have one major climax, and that be it. Not Lateralus. Repeated climactic areas occur on this album, and that is a hint for some people not ready for it, to put the album back on the shelf and leave the store. But those willing to keep going, follow into the 3rd climax as \\"Parabol\\" hits \\"Parabola\\" and we are taken through one of the most intriguing and genuinely amazing tracks that Tool's ever produced. The two combined were a single (though most radio stations started \\"Parabol\\" at the 2:55 mark, just in time for the climax into \\"Parabola\\") It doesn't end there either.<br /><br />\\"Ticks & Leeches\\" screams potential. Maynard has been noted to have scorched his chords on this one while edging out the screams. That's intense. Much like the transition from \\"Schism\\" to \\"Parabol\\" there's a drop off mid song, that just sends you down the stream, with a little bit of string to hold you on. Then, when you're just about completely submerged, they pull you out of that trance for the next climax, and close out this amazing track.<br /><br />\\"Lateralus\\" the title track is my personal favorite. Cracking in at over 9 minutes long, I think it represents the style of Tool much more then anything else on the album. \\"Black and white are, all I see, in my infancy\\" it sets up the transitions between Maynard's vocals and the rest of the bands punctuality with him. Its not sporadic, its all purposeful, and thats what sets them apart from a lot of other bands. They take time to write it, and dont rush it, thats why there's a good amount of time between each release. To see this song live was amazing, and Danny Carey made sure you got everything you paid for with his solo to finish us off. A masterpiece.<br /><br />Its not over yet though. Considered to be one long track just broken up, Tracks 10-12 all seem to share a similar theme to them. \\"Disposition\\" is the four and a half minute under balanced track, composed of the same lyrics, over a hypnotic melody. I've often found myself, falling asleep here. Not because I was bored, but because I was relaxed. This is Maynard letting you drift off and relax. But not for long, though \\"Reflection\\" is an extension of \\"Disposition\\" it seems at times, its by no means boring. It keeps the theme moving right along of Lateralus, making the listener believe that what they've just listened to, the last 10 tracks, to be the end of this intense ride through the mind. Until you hit around 6 minutes of this 11 minute track, and Maynard brings you back in. Then its \\"Triad\\" which uses many hard guitars to bring you back in for the final climax. Intense, predominantly instrumental, but completely fitting for the end. Because after \\"Triad\\"...you're left with the lonely frantic blubberings of a former Area 51 officer in \\"Faaip De Oiad\\" ...which I'm sure is actually a joke.<br /><br />The actual climaxes happen here: The Patient (about 3 minutes or so in), Schism (half way through or so), Parabol/Parabola transition, Ticks and Leeches drop off, then resurface, almost all of Lateralus (track 9), and during Triad.<br /><br />So there you have it, Lateralus. What many consider to be the greatest Tool album ever. Others believe its pure garbage. I on the other hand have to agree that it is quite amazing and beautiful. I can't argue with those who see it as near perfect. There's a common misconception about Tool being Satan worshippers, and its all nonsense. In fact, they pray before every meal. They just encourage you to think for yourself, and question authority. Five stars, doesn't do this justice. It should be in everyones possession, to be enjoyed, and experienced. If you haven't, you should. If you have, you know exactly what I'm talking about.ong, though \\"Reflection\\" is an extension of \\"Disposition\\" it seems at times, its by no means boring.

B000000OAN|5.0|classic Queen. i don't know what it is with re-releasing already classic albums with remixes and live tracks.just leave these albums alone already and put those b-sides on albums all it's own. with that aside this album really is perfect. freddie mercury had one of the most beautiful voices in all of rock history and should be remembered for that as well as his incredible stage presence. \\"death on two legs\\", \\"you're my best friend\\" and \\"bohemian Rhapsody\\" are there more well known songs,but the rest compliment the album beautifully and don't qualify as mere filler. check out the uncategorizable \\"'39\\" for starters.probably Queen's greatest album, aside from their greatest hits albums.BUY THIS CD!
B000BP86OG|4.0|For the previous reviewer I offer a quote from the movie Stripes, \\"Lighten up Francis\\".   <br /> <br />The Darkness is a band that's about having fun.  Their attitude is fun and their music is fun.  These guys are great, and they offer a very refreshing change from all the depressing, ultra-serious music that exists today.  Are they great musicians?...no, is Justin a great singer?...no, do they overdub and mix to create a better sound?...yes they do (Spoiler Alert here....so does everyone else!  Queen did it, Zepplin did it...welcome to reality folks!).   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, the Darkness has talent and they use it well (I have seen them live and they sounded great).  This album doesn't have a bad song on it.  It is great ROCK, and it's also great fun.  I would highly recommend it to anyone.  If you loved PTL, you'll love this one.  Buy it, sing along, rock your a** off and have a great time.  I did. <br /> <br />And for the record, I don't live with my parents. <br />
0553801503|4.0|I read this right after reading Robert Jordan's latest and was far more entertained with \\"Crows\\". Jordan could use some lessons from Martin on narrative pacing. Martin does seem to slow down the plot a bit, assumingly to set the stage for future books. I think this is faithful to how the \\"real world\\" works, but doesn't make for the most exciting reading at times.  <br /> <br />But Martin's real strength is character development and I think he is true to form here. Really enjoyed the development of Jaime as a character - no he doesn't do much but you get some much needed insight to his motivations and character.  <br /> <br />The book missed Tyrion and Danerys however, my favorite characters from the previous books. They add a lot of depth to the story line and I found myself wanting to skip chapters in the previous books to pick up their stories again. <br /> <br />Also, the brutality gets a bit overwhelming at times. What was a realistic, refreshing change over the faeryland fodder out there a few years ago seems over the top now. Maybe it's Martin, maybe it's me... <br /> <br />Definitely worth a read though
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First of all, this disc is outstanding; an entire CD of uncompromising hard rock, coupled with an excellent acoustic disc.  This allows the band to go to both extremes without worrying about spacing softer songs between loud rockers.  I have the rock CD on my MP3 player for working out, and the soft CD in the \\"dinner music\\" lineup with Norah Jones (who also does a cameo on the album).  Pure genius. <br /> <br />Wait; did I say MP3 player?  YES!!  All these militant I-Pod freaks that are wailing about the copy protection have fallen victim to Apple's insistence on using the dreaded \\"proprietary technology\\" for their I tunes/I Pod business.  I have a relatively cheap I-River MP3 player and had no probem putting the Foo Fighters CD on the player.  Nearly all non-Apple MP3 players can support the protected DRM-WMA file format contained on this disc.  Here's how it works... <br /> <br />When you put the CD into the computer, it loads in the songs via its own software (and yes, you can choose not to install it, and no there is no spyware or \\"cyberterrorism\\" attached).  You then tranfer all songs as WMA files with the accompanying licenses.  Once you have done this, you can transfer the files to your MP3 player, and yes even burn them to a CD!!  The only thing you cannot do is Email the tracks or put them on a Kazaa style file sharing network!! <br /> <br />The only trick is, in order to put the songs on your MP3 player you must use Windows Media Player, not the software that came with the MP3 player.  My \\"Iriver manager\\" cannot transfer the DRM licenses so the tracks won't play.  There is a help menu as soon as you load in the CD that explains everything. <br /> <br />So now the I-Pod users know how I felt when I purchased $30 worth of songs on I tunes, only to find that they are not true MP3 files and therefore would not play on regular MP3 players like mine!  Since Apple will not permit these \\"M4p\\" files to play on non-Ipod players, then it's only fair that the Windowsbased copy protection won't play on Apple's players.  For those of us who opted to purchase one of the dozens of non-Apple MP3 players, there is no problem!!
B00002Z88D|5.0|This album truly builds upon the Metallica songs in ways I never thought possible. The symphony sounds like it was made to be there on the orginal tracks, which many Metallica fans know quite well already. Songs like Master of Puppets, The Thing That Should Not Be, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Wherever I May Roam, Enter Sandman, and Battery stand out already on their albums, so the biggest surprise is what the the symphonic accompaniment does for lesser Metallica tracks. Many people criticize Load and Reload for weaker songs (I agree, especially on Reload, which I refuse to purchase), but tracks like Fuel, The Memory Remains, Devil's Dance (ok Black Album there), and Bleeding Me finally become redeeming because of the energy in the fantastic symphonic additions. Tracks from the Black Album end up improved as well, but not as dramatically as later works. Finally, Metallica proves they still can write excellent songs (circa 1999) with No Leaf Clover and Human. <br /> <br />This is a solid album, and I highly recommend it for any Metallica fan.

B000B86S1Q|5.0|I had to give this book 5 stars only because you cannot give them 6! I loved this book, ahern gets the perfect balance between humour and sadness which makes it the perfect read. Touching, heart warming and beautiful, you warm to all the characters in the book, and really feel like you know them. One warning though: it will make you cry!
B000026OHN|5.0|I have long held Richter to be a master of baroque music and polyphonic music in general. Since fugues are a model for conflicting layered themes and their intertwining with other themes, this music can be very difficult and a surprising number of pianists cannot master them. Richter is very serious in anything he plays and you can see that throughout the cycle he is very consistent and never gets lazy. This is what makes Richter so special.... is his mastery and understanding of braod genres of music ( a legitimate criticism, I guess to a certain extent, to Horowitz and Rubinstien who molded their repertoire to suit what they played well). Richter's Baroque is very different than conventional Baroque - more intense, less benign, even agressive at times. I guess it is worthwhile to hold a view versions if one wishes - harpsichord, Richter, maybe Schiff. Overall, this CD is close to my heart.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|After nearly a year of hype, the most talked about dvd of 2005 is finally here, and I'm thrilled to report that Paramount has done a remarkable job in bringing KING KONG to the digital medium! This is the film that made Jessica Lange a superstar, and Paramount's gorgeous new transfer captures the actress at her most beautiful.  One of the best discs the studio has ever produced, the care and attention lavished on this classic library title reinforces just how much the company is dedicated to the restoration and preservation of a wide variety of films. As far as extras, it must have been tempting for the good people at Paramount to provide fans with every last tidbit of production and promotional material related to this project, but the studio wisely avoided the \\"puff\\" pieces and instead put together a solid package of the most interesting and historically relevant information pertaining to the film; the supplementary material included herein is nothing short of magnificent! It's releases like this one that have established Paramount's vaunted position in the dvd community, and builds anticipation for the many fine discs to come.
0553801503|2.0|Having gobbled up the first books in this series, I anxiously awaited the release of Crows.  I read the author's web page as well as other pages so I was ready for the slower plot lines and the absence of some characters.   <br /> <br />So, taking that into consideration, these were my main complaints: <br /> <br />- Martin spends way too much time on details that the reader does not need.  Yes he is the master of description and dialogue, but no one needs to spend two pages reading about every Knight attending some conference and their respective sigils.   <br /> <br />-  There was a lot more flashback, and I am not a big fan of that.  It seemed like around every corner some character was rememering when something happened, then followed what that incident was.  Interesting is what is currently happening in the story along with a few glimpses of the past.  I think it unnecessary to continuously flashback over, and over, and over again. <br /> <br />- I am a firm believer that chapters should add something relevant to the story.  There were many chapters where I felt that if I did not read them I would not have missed anything.  Other chapters did reveal something of the story but the revelation was so minor - and usually found on the last page - that I wondered what the other 14 pages of the chapter were for. <br /> <br />- I felt with this release, Martin knew he had his readers hooked.  Knowing that, he wrote this book to add to the overall story, only, for the most part the additions were minor.  An editor could have easily chopped out much of the unnecessary descriptions and horse ridings and conferences and pointless dialogues and combined this with Dance  - making it one novel.  That Martin released this (after such a long period in between), is a pretty big let down.  I found myself reading not because I wanted to, but because I was interested in finishing the story all the way through Dance.  Martin needs to stop showing off his ability to make up names andsigils and just continue doing what he was doing in the beginning. <br /> <br />Suggestion to readers:  If you have not read the other books, get them and devour them - they are wonderful.  When you get to this one, look for a cliffnote or an abridged version - or, better yet, ask someone who read it what happens.  save yourself the time and just hope that Dance returns to the original formula that made this a great story in the first place.  Thanks.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|Hey, this is a really funny mockumentary! It's about this fictional band, not Spinal Tap, but this one's called Metallica. Get this... they call in a psychoanalyist to help them deal with their feelings... HA! It's really funny. There are some great scenes showing how the band comes up with some really moronic lyrics. They even have a fictional ex-member come into therapy, crying about how he was kicked out more than twenty years ago! So funny! How about, \\"we can only listen to the recordings between 12 and 4.\\" That was just as funny as the first Spinal Tap, the \\"turn it up to 11\\" bit. Or there's the funny bit where they talk about how hard their lives are now, and then they show the balding one on his ranch. I even heard they put out a fake soundtrack, St. Anger, to go along with this very funny fake movie! You'll laugh until you pee! (Note- fake stars omitted, leaving only one).
B000683VI4|5.0|The original romance novel by Nicholas Sparks transitioned into a tear-jerking love story for everyone to enjoy (in other words a chick flick women would definitely benefit from). The actors chosen could not have been any better, they really knew how to bring a sense of reality, and comfort to the movie.  <br /> The film is based on a couple who fought for their love and ended up growing old together. The movie is told though flashbacks, while Noah Calhoun reads from a notebook that unveils the story of Noah and Allie's life together. In the present days Noah is played by James Garner, and Allie is played by Gena Rowlands. <br /> The other time frame is during the 1940s, around the time of World War II. This is when teenage Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) met with her future love, the young Noah (Ryan Gosling). You could say it was love at first sight for Noah, as Allie realized her love for him in the later on. As the relationship prospered, social status and Allies greedy mother (Joan Allen), lead to a split; however, the break up would be just long enough for Allie and Noah to be brought back together again.  <br /> The ending of the film brings everything all together as a whole, for a heart filled resolution. The director couldn't have made the ending any more unrealistic, but it does comply with the routine soppy love endings. <br /> This movie brings out the ideal craziness of love. As cheesy as the movie really is, you can't help but grow a likeness for the couple. Gosling and McAdams are the epitome of a match made in heaven, you learn to love them together, and it is hard to look at them when they are apart.  <br />
B00081U6EG|3.0|Well the idea SOUNDED fantastic: Celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster with a live concert featuring some of its greatest practitioners.  Unfortunately somewhere between conceptualization and realization, things went horribly wrong.  Now maybe I'm not aware of the logistics needed to pull off such an event, but even a monkey with a bag over his head could've picked a better set of names.  I WILL give the organizers this though, they struck platinum when they landed David Gilmour, easily one of THE premiere guitar gods to be associated with the Strat (or ANY guitar for that matter).  Likewise Gary Moore.  Though considered a Les Paul man since 1990, Gary has abused quite a few strats throughout his hard rock/metal days so he easily qualifies.  And to be fair, they supposedly had the legendary Jeff Beck signed as well (certainly another of the greatest EVER) but somehow managed to lose him in the end.  From there, things rapidly deteriorated to the point of complete confusion.  Where was Robin Trower??  It's been said that he's been staying close to home due to touring costs.  And Ritchie Blackmore??  Couldn't anyone convince him to plug in again for just one night??  How about Mark Knopfler??  Buddy Guy??  What about young guns Joe Bonamassa, Chris Duarte, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd??  Didn't anyone think of buying Eric Johnson a plane ticket???  Unfortunately, oversights like these made for a rather disappointing show.  If you're a guitar-playing music fan looking for strat players to show you how it's done, you'll have to wade through a lot of junk to get to the good stuff.  But enough whining; here are the highlights:  <br /> <br />For me, the whole reason to buy this DVD is David Gilmour, who took the stage to a standing ovation.  The crowd was not disappointed.  Although he looked a bit thrown off by the house band at times (some cues were missed by the band during the free time intros to two of the songs), once he settled in he just soared.  Without question, of all the acts that night, Dave displayed the widest array of sonic possibilities a stratocaster can offer: bending strings; caressing the whammy bar; using volume swells; feedback touches; playing behind the nut; all the while blending lush liquid melodic lines with searing hot earth-shaking licks.  I've certainly seen him perform these songs better, but even \\"mediocre Gilmour\\" is stunning.  The next reason to pick this DVD up is Gary Moore.  Another astounding player, Gary performed a barn burning version of Red House, taking his battered strat from hushed whispers to absolutely blazing runs in the blink of an eye.  Like Gilmour, he demonstrated how much can be done with the instrument in his way-too-brief set (I highly recommend picking up his Live at Montreaux DVD as well as tracking down his two flawless out-of-print VHS shows).  Other highlights include Hank Marvin, whose simple but silky lines decorated with light whammy bar touches really showcased the gorgeous pure tone of the stratocaster.  His set was a nice surprise and clearly illustrated why he was such a hero to many of England's greatest players.  Then there was Albert Lee who lit up an otherwise dull moment by pop/country act Theresa Anderson.  Lee's flashy chicken pickin' during Country Boy was a brief highlight of this otherwise dreary set.  Phil Manzenera was another nice surprise.  He played a mid-tempo instrumental with a slight Eastern flavor, taking advantage of the strat's tremolo bar.  I would've liked to have heard more.   <br /> <br />The extras here include interviews with some of the performers reminiscing about their first encounter with the Fender Strat and how it changed them.  I found this segment rather enjoyable.  If you are a guitar player yourself, you will likely relate to a lot of the comments and may develop a sudden urge to go shopping for a 2-tone sunburst strat with a blonde neck.   <br /> <br />So bottom line, is this worth it?  Well like most \\"star studded\\" concert discs, you will likely watch the full show once and then find yourself just jumping around to your favorite cuts later on.  How many cuts are worth jumping to is obviously up to your own personal taste.  All in all this is basically a fair DVD that could've been miles better.  As a final thought, if you're on the fence and need just one good reason to drop some cash on this, remember that the proceeds go to Nordoff-Robbins Musical Therapy.  And that's not a bad reason at all. <br />
B000002JNJ|5.0|Anybody dissing Pantera should legally have all their music removed or placed in quarantine. Pantera was one band that made a career the old fashion way,touring, playing live and good ol' word of mouth. No MTV, radio or internet dowloads yet they put out classics and never sold out. My suggestion is clean your ears, stop smoking that \\"herb\\",grow a brain and listen to their albums and think \\"wow, this band rocks more than the other crap I listen to\\" because every 5 star reviewer knows the real value of this band and their records and will forever stand the test of time.
B000AP04FG|3.0|First, I didn't see Mr. & Mrs. Smith at the theater, but I did see a particular trailer to the movie which showed Angelina Jolie putting on a pair of nylon stockings.  That scene in the trailer (I don't know if it was actually in the theatrical release or not) is pretty much the only reason I purchased the video.  To the young, middle-aged, and old guys out there like me who may also be buying the video for the same reason, the scene has been cut, or deleted.  Now, all you see is Angelina walking around in a white bra and half-slip.  Of course, you can see the garter tabs and the tops of the stockings through the slip when she stands in the light.  You can also see a brief still of her adjusting one of the garters in the \\"Making of a Scene\\" feature.  I hate it when the director, or studio, does this to the male fans!  I've never forgiven Lawrence Kasdan for a scene he cut out of Body Heat, and that was twenty-five years ago.  My guess is that a longer version of the video (Director's Cut, Special Edition, Collector's Edition, New Extended Edition, etc.) will be out in six-to-eight months so that the guys will buy the new version in the hope of seeing the beautiful Angelina putting on her nylons.  Most women have never understood what a powerful affect that has on a male.  As to the rest of the movie, rent it, or wait till the longer version comes out.  There's no resolution at the end with regards to the killers that are sent out after this couple and what the CIA's final solution is to the problem.  I suspect an Alternate Ending will be attached to the newer version in a few months.  I will say that the bantering between Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt was fun to watch.  It had me laughing in a number of places.  Still, this isn't something I particularly will want to watch a second time...that is until the new version finally comes out, and it will.
B000007T1M|5.0|Possibly one of my personnal favorite albums ever is this self titled album from System of a Down, a strange yet subtle album that pushes the range this band can go from light, thrash and death all in one song. Serj possibly has a range from melodic, bizzare and twisted to death growling mayhem. Daron has some great guitar riffs that are melodic and heavy with some of his best work ever.Shavo is one badass drummer who has a better pattern than many other nu metal drummers. John has decent basslines but performs grsat combo to the guitar. My favorite tracks are Suite Pee,Spiders, Sugar, War?, Mind, Soil and PLUCK yet the rest are great tracks on their own. Get this sick,twisted album by a sick twisted band. Pick Toxity too to make a great combo.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I have to say the storyline is kind of different and interesting.  The movie takes about 30 minutes to really get started and yes it is somewhat predictable, but it kept my attention pretty well overall.  I would have liked to have seen a little more action and even romance, but I guess they gave us as much as they could.  It would have been better for me to have had the ending summed up a little bit more.  And what is it exactly that Vince Vaughn does in this movie?  He plays a friend and partner like person to Pitt's character, but really doesn't do much except talk alot.  I am giving it 5 stars simply because of Pitt and Jolie are the stars of this movie.  I have always been a fan of both, so having them together in one movie no matter what the storyline means I will at least watch it once.
0061015725|4.0|Like most Michael Crichton books, this one is a fun, fast, exciting read.  I give it 3.5 stars.  PREY is a \\"Frankenstein\\" story about nanotechnology/biotechnology/computer technology run amok... but it also borrows themes from INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, and the campy 60's TV series VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA (where every week one or more of the crewmembers is \\"taken over by aliens\\").<br /><br />The story includes some very strong character development, and it is easy to relate with the main character Jack's plight througout the story.  Jack is an out-of-work high-tech Silicon Valley software manager, who is playing Mr. Mom, while his wife is trying to score big by hooking some big Venture Capital money in the fledgling nanotechnology industry... she and others at her company are very agressive and competitive - too much for their own good, it turns out.<br /><br />The biggest problems I had with the book were related to a number of unbelievable scenarios.  For example, the scenes involving the \\"dirt bike\\" were totally unbelievable - the way the scene is described, I kept imagining these two big guys trying to get on the equivalent of a Japanese 70cc 2-stroke pit bike, which he \\"pulls out of the trunk\\" of a vehicle... it would have bottomed out the suspension!  and even that bike wouldn't have needed the all-important \\"missing key\\"... and he \\"straddles the bike and starts if up\\"??? electric start on a small dirt bike?? ... and then, it has a light?... so maybe it was a like a modern 650cc 4-stroke enduro??? It makes no sense - that bike's suspension would be WAY too tall for the described antics to have transpired, and how could he pull the bike out of the trunk so easy then, and how could he have started a 4-stroke so fast - after he had LAID IT ON THE GROUND! ... nope - COULDN'T have happened the way it was described - no way, no how.  And, there were other unbelievable scenes like with the wind changing speed from calm to very gusty, up and down, throughout a whole day (obviously because it suited the flow of the story) - I've lived in the high desert, and it aint gonna happen how it was described.<br /><br />Michael Crichton goes to great lengths to do research on the high-tech subjects in his books (look at the footnotes and bibliography), but then he goofs up on simple everyday technology like \\"dirt bikes\\" and \\"desert winds\\"... man, he could just have taken 1 day to go out in the desert and research what it is like to ride a dirt bike, and to know what the winds are really like... or just talk to someone about this stuff.(obviously because it suited the flow of the story) - I've lived in the high desert, and it aint gonna happen how it was described.    Michael Crichton goes to great lengths to do research on the high-tech subjects in his books (look at the footnotes and bibliography), but then he goofs up on simple everyday technology like \\"dirt bikes\\" and \\"desert winds\\"... man, he could just have taken 1 day to go out in the desert and research what it is like to ride a dirt bike, and to know what the winds are really like... or just talk to someone about this stuff.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|After a night of drinking, a man is imprisoned by some unknown people and left there for 15 years until he's let out.  After a while trying to readjust to society and figure out what's happened, he is given 5 days to wreak vengeance upon whoever took his life away from him.  Unfortunately, the progress is being watched by a less than benevolent spectator.<br /><br />What's interesting about this film is it's influences.  It's based loosely around The Count of Monte Cristo, takes a lot of Shakespearian and Biblical elements, throws in typical Asian kung fu, and then puts it into a very modern stylistic context in terms of cinema.  The best part about this movie's style is that it never actually feels overdone and it actually seems to make sense...  a shot isn't canted just to be weird, it's more subtle than that, even if the tone itself bleeds the idea of style.<br /><br />Honestly, I was taken simply by a single shot, a long take where the camera tracks along a hallway as the main character fights off a large group of people.  It straddles the line between realism and romance and creates a distructive ballet of choreography and motion that is downright beautiful in a somewhat horrible way.  Then setting it into the context it has to a rather well done and structured story really helps this movie have a profound effect on the viewer.  Just don't expect to be coming out of this feeling very happy, as it gets a bit disturbing at the end.<br /><br />It may have overdone the ending, but I don't care.  The weird mix of hypnosis and not-hypnosis kind of constricted the story.  It is interesting to note that this film is of a new group of films out there that a few people call Asian Extreme Cinema, and I've seen two other films from this neo-genre that involve heavy use of violence and hypnosis themes (and men cutting their own tongues out).  Why do these images seem to tie this genre together?  What is it about hypnosis, specifically, that creates an anxious desire in these filmmakers for broken vigilantes?<br /><br />--PolarisDiBn these filmmakers for broken vigilantes? <br /> <br />--PolarisDiB

0393035158|4.0|I think this book is brilliantly written. I also think Harris is a brave guy. Bravo!<br /><br />I only have two critcisms. One is that many of the Koran verses Harris uses are taken out of historical context. He doesn't explain the wars that were happening at the time the Koran was being written and that would help understand where all of that war language originates. The other criticism I have is that while Harris gives several examples of Islamic terrorism, he doesn't give any of Christian terrorism. I am thinking of McVey, of course,  and the right-to-life-people who have killed or attempted to kill doctors for performing abortions. While these acts were not commited on the scale of the Sept. 11 attacks, they most assuredly came from the same place- religion.
0671027344|5.0|woahhhh this book was soo good! <br /> <br />The main character was so believable, and the way he writes his life story is beautiful. The context of his writing, was letters, to a \\"friend\\" and the reader is the friend. He explains the teenage perspective of sex, masterbating, and all sorts of stuff. I think that this book was amazing, and i read it within 3 days. The book is short, but don't let that be a bad thing, becuase this book is just amazing, and you should read it!
B000BJS4SU|4.0|It seems to me by reading most of these reviews that people have a deep hatred of john mayer. i can understand this as just the mention o \\"fall out boy\\" makes the bile rise to the front of my mouth. point is, get past the look and voice people. u dont like it, listen to something else. dont waste time complaining about how he looks or his vocals or that he isnt the greatest guitar player of all time. (ya know what? he ISNT...but he is damn good and really thats all that matters) <br /> <br />HOWEVER, after listening to several tracks on this record, it is obvious that isnt the greatest cd of all time nor the worst. its an interesting & experimental outing for john mayer in company. sure it isnt true-down-home-blues, but this is john mayer we are talkin about and he does a good job of making it his own. the sound quality is excellent for a live record and it makes for a nice party background-music cd. all in all, i say worth the 10-13 bucks.
0739308742|3.0|Years ago, Doonesbury had a spoof series in which the minor characters in the strip went on strike for larger parts. That's what much of this book feels like.<br /><br />The writing is strong, but with the exception of the story line of the Lanester Queen and her twin, the book is almost totally absent of the more major characters we've been focusing on in the previous books.<br /><br />I know some authors have written series and then spun around to fill in the story of a minor character in a more involved way, for example the superlative Shadow Series by Orson Scott Card which fleshes out the story of Ender's Games sideline characters.  Unfortunately, it's as if the author decided not to wait to complete his story before doing so.<br /><br />It's enough to bring new understanding to Stephen King's old anecdote about The Stand. He said he had too many characters, so he put a bomb in the closet and killed half of them.<br /><br />After listening to this, I began to wish I could point out to George that a dragon in the closet would have the same effect.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this on Fridays when FOX first aired it.  I rented the whole series from NETFLIX. I have asked for the DVD box set for Christmas. FOX should of shown them in the order that the DVD's are in it would have made more sense.  The unaired episodes are some of the best.  \\"Heart of Gold\\" is my favorite. Please buy these.  Go see the movie \\"Serenity\\" and buy the DVD on December 20, 2005.  Can't Take my sky from me...I found Serenity <br />
006016848X|4.0|I first read this when I was dating my now husband. I recently re-read it as a married woman and I still enjoy it as much as I did then. It really hits on the difficulties that most people have in a relationship. My girlfriends often call me for love advice and I encourage them to read this book(I even sent the audio version to one of them) because they get in fights and don't know why. Their guy doesn't do what they want or stomps on their feelings and they can't figure it out. This book is very eye-opening. It also has good suggestions like the '101 ways to score points with a woman'. It can give a guy some good insights and I think can really improve communication and selfless loving. It is not for the casual relationship though. I guess the Mars and Venus Dating might work for that.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|One might be tempted to say this CD is typical Enya fare, however there is absolutely nothing typical where Enya is concerned. There is an old adage among performers which says something about .......\\"always leave them wanting more\\", and in this case I would have to agree. When the CD ended, I was thoroughly disappointed, but not for lack of content. From the first note to the last I was drawn in and this one will rank among my favourites. Thanks Enya, for another stellar performance.
B000683VI4|5.0|Nicholas Spark is one of the greatest authors of romance novels so it was no surprise Hollywood created a movie out of The Notebook, which in turn became one of the greatest romantic movies of all time.  <br /> <br />Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams had such an amazing chemistry on-screen, I went home and thought to myself that they really should be together off-screen as well.  <br />Rachel McAdams stars as Allie Hamilton, a wealthy young girl and Ryan Gosling stars as Noah Calhoun, a young boy struggling to save money to buy his dream house. The two met one summer and at first, Allie is reluctant to go out with Noah. But as Noah hangs from the Ferris Wheel with two hands threatening Allie if she doesn't agree, he'll let go, she screams at him, \\"I WANNA GO OUT WITH YOU!\\" As the movie progresses, Allie and Noah's love for each other begins to grow. But as the summer comes to an end so did their relationship, broken up by Allie's mother who sees Noah as \\"trash\\". Allie moves away to New York and Noah joins the army. Seven years pass by and Allie becomes engaged to a soldier. In the midst of her wedding planning, a picture of Noah standing in front of his dream house in the newspaper captures her eye. The house was restored the exact way Noah had promised her. As Allie's love for Noah jumps back alive, she rushes back to him before she gets married. When they finally meet after seven years apart, it's obvious that they both still love each other but the only problem was Allie was engaged. So she struggles to make the right decision, her first true love or her fianc.  <br /> <br />I never watched a movie that tugged at my heart strings as much as this movie did. Forget Titanic, forget Romeo and Juliet, and forget every romantic movie you have ever seen and go out and buy yourself, The Notebook. The acting was so extraordinarily amazing Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling made the love connection between Allie and Noah felt so real. But what made the acting so great were thelines in the movie that will probably have you quoting it for the next year. For instance, the scene where Allie and Noah meet after seven years and Allie goes, \\"Why didn't you write me? Why? It wasn't over for me; I waited for you for seven years. But now it's too late.\\" Noah replies, \\"I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you everyday for a year.\\" Then Allie dumbfounded replies, \\"You wrote me?\\" and he says, \\"Yes... it wasn't over, it still isn't over,\\" and swoops her up in this great kissing scene.  <br />  <br />I believe every woman, girl, whoever should just watch this movie because I guarantee you by the end of the movie, you would be bawling your eyes out or would have at least shed a tear and who couldn't use a good crying? Most movies nowadays starts out great: great beginning, great plot but the ending just completely ruins the whole movie but The Notebook did not leave me disappointed in the slightest bit and after watching this movie, I truly believed Nicholas Spark is the greatest romantic novelist out there.  <br />
B00005JO17|1.0|A lot of violence for a G rated movie.  More along the line of The Incredibles which was rated PG. <br /> <br />I am glad I prescreened this movie.  I definitely will NOT be taking my 4 year old daughter to see it.  She was so frightened by the violence in The Incredibles that she was shaking and we had to leave the theater. <br />   <br />The violence in this movie is on the same par. <br /> <br />I loved The Incredibles, but it wasn't for my daughter. <br /> <br />Chicken Little, on the other hand, doesn't have any redeeming qualities. <br /> <br />The story was weak and contrived. <br /> <br />how bad is it?   <br /> <br />See it in theaters: no.   <br />Wait for the DVD: no. <br />Wait for it to come on TV: no, watch something else... <br /> <br />Disney needs to remmeber it is the STORY that is important, not the way it is animated.  CGI for CGI's sake is a fast road to mediocraty. <br /> <br />Still waiting for the next \\"Nemo\\" quality movie... <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I'm one of Enya's dedicated fans, but it doesn't mean that everyhing she does is automatically fantastic and superb in my ears. I could be critical towards her if there would be a reason, but fortunately, there hasn't been reason yet. \\"The Memory of Trees\\" was a bit of a let-down for me, but still a good record.     And so it's her 6th one, \\"Amarantine\\". Actually I consider it to be one her Top 3, only \\"Watermark\\" and \\"Shepherd Moons\\" ahead. So all of these negative reviews here from 'the dedicated fans' have amazed me. It seems that there are two different \\"Amarantine\\" copies in circulation, because it's beyond my comprehension how anyone can give this record a one star and still love Enya's previous works.    Enya is enya, she's doing music which has her character all over it. If she would change her style, that would not be Enya anymore. And what kind of changes in her style she is supposed to make? A country record perhaps? Or techno? Please... Those who find her repetitive, I think it's a bit too late to say it after the 6th album. I would have stopped listening her ten years ago, and not bothered to try her albums anymore.    And this album is no way \\"A Day Without Rain part II\\". Many things have changed from that record. There is only one instrumental this time, when others had three. There is no Latin, but Japanese and Loxian, a totally new language created by a lyricist Roma Ryan. All songs Enya sang by Loxian are quite different in styles than on \\"A Day Without Rain\\". \\"Less Than a Pearl\\" could have been on \\"The Celts\\" album, \\"The River Sings\\" is a bit like \\"Ebudae\\" from \\"Shepherd Moons\\". \\"Water Shows the Hidden Heart\\" is one of Enya's finest moments in her whole career. I think she has not made anything similar before. It's like an aria from Puccini's opera with some church music feeling. Enya's voice is also more prominent this time and sounds lovelier than ever.    If you are an Enya-devotee, I think you are aware of the fact that everyone of her album'shas its own mood and color. The fact that each of her albums has their own admirers, tells that she has no weak records in her catalogue. You may not like each of them equally, but that's just a matter of taste. \\"Amarantine\\" is not going to be everone's favorite Enya album, but the fact is that it's just as enjoyable as the rest of them. There is no-one quite like Enya, and let's be happy that she's giving us something unique from her music. The gaps between her records may be long, but remember that it takes a long time to make an Enya-album. And that time is always worth waiting for, and this time is no exception.
B0006J28MI|4.0|Richie Rich is the world's poor little rich boy. He's the richest kid on Earth, but all he really wants are friends (well, he's got everything else). He spends his days living by a meticulous schedule that sometimes even includes filling in for his father at public appearances. His wealthy schoolmates are just as busy as he is and not quite as desperate to do \\"regular kid things\\" as Richie. While filling in for his father at a public event, however, Richie takes notice of some inner-city, street-wise kids playing baseball in a vacant lot nearby and makes an attempt to join in. They soon make it clear that he does not belong, and poor Richie goes home in despair. Seeing his disappointment, Richie's protective and caring butler, Cadbury, makes arrangements for the kids to come to the Rich family mansion and spend a day with the boy, much to Richie's joy and surprise! The gang of kids have a ball riding Richie's rollercoaster, trying out his kid-a-pult, and eating in his own, personal McDonald's. At the end of the day, Richie's new friends have accepted him as being just another regular kid, though they more than appreciate the benefits that come with his friendship. Still, feisty redhead Gloria, self-appointed leader of the bunch, makes it clear that they like Richie more for who he is than for all the neat stuff he has. Richie doesn't have much time to be happy about that, though. Word soon arrives that Richie's parents, benign but sometimes clueless Richard and Regina Rich, were victims of an assassination attempt and are now lost at sea and assumed dead. As the Riches survive in a life raft on Perrier and champagne, Richie is forced to take over the family company and keep it safe from malicious top executive Lawrence Van Dough, who planned the attack on Richie's parents in the first place. Luckily, with his new friends' help, Richie turns out to be a business whiz! Richie has to become even more assertive when Cadburry is framed and locked up for the murder of Richie's parents though. Some help from in-house inventor Professor Keenbean allows Richie to break Cadburry out, but matters become even more complicated when the Rich parents finally are rescued by the villainous Van Dough and his cronies themselves, purely so they can open the voice-activated lock on the family vault in Mt. Richmore. Now, Richie and his crew must prove their mettle and save Richie's parents and fortune from a criminal desperate to do anything to have it all!<br /><br />After the wonderful holiday films \\"Home Alone\\" and \\"Home Alone 2\\" turned child-actor Macaulay Culkin into an instant superstar, he sadly seemed incapable of having another success. 1994's \\"Richie Rich\\" was just one example of several films the young actor made after his big Christmas hits that failed to strike a chord with movie going audiences or critics. Sadly, \\"Richie Rich\\" is really a great film. While not a perfect adaptation of the comic and cartoon (the villainous Van Dough is an adult exec here rather than a rotten cousin, Gloria is unfortunately a cute but street-sassy tomboy with a last-name change rather than Richie's sweet and femininely dressed girlfriend, and Irona the robot maid/bodyguard is nowhere to be seen until the direct to video \\"sequel\\"), the performances, particularly the adult ones, are fantastic, fun, well developed and well fleshed-out considering their cartoon origins, and easily carry the very basic cartoon plot. The humor and emotion is well-written, even if it's an age-old story of the rich kid who just wants friends. And, of course, the sights are the icing on the cake, from the kooky inventions of Professor Keenbean to the glorious Rich Family Estate (actually the Biltmore Estate in North Carolina), not to mention the world's only Dollarmation, Richie's dog, Dollar! The DVD is in widescreen and includes one Bonus Feature, which is the theatrical trailer. Hey, \\"Richie Rich\\" isn't rocket science, but it's a feast for the eyes and a fun family fantasy frohie's parents though.

Hey, \\"Richie Rich\\" isn't rocket science, but it's a feast for the eyes and a fun family fantasy from beginning to end that brings back childhood memories of Saturday morning cartoons and Harvey comics, and with actors like Edward Herrmann, John Larroquette, and Jonathan Hyde in a live-action cartoon, you know you're in for a treat!   <br />
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is an awesome CD. Although I liked her Immaculate Collection album, I feel that this cd brings about a more mature Madonna. Her music is softer and her voice better modulated than her high shrilly voice from the 80's. I definitely do recommend this album to all Madonna fans. All of the songs on this cd I like with the exception of Erotica but 1 out 16 isn't all bad.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|How should a movie be judged?  By the play/movie/book that preceded it?<br /><br />I think not.<br /><br />The play was significantly different than the book and previous film versions but few complained.<br /><br />Let's judge the movie for itself:<br /><br />1) I love the camera work.  We the viewers are offered the opportunity of giddily flying through the opera house time and time again.  I love the scenes backstage and the many flickering gas flames.  I love the fluid movement during the scene where Carlotta gets into her pink dress - it floats down upon her.<br /><br />2) The movie works BECAUSE the Phantom is, well, hot.  His age is in his favor (he COULD be Christine's father as opposed to her grandfather).  As well, his appeal creates a convincing tension for Christine and we the viewer can understand her inner turmoil.  Should she run off with the handsome blond or with the dynamic stranger who is a natty dresser, has an incredible, ah, lair, and is a genius to boot?  His deformity makes him additionally appealing - one's heart goes out to him.<br /><br />3) The over-the-top sets are visually rich and enjoyable.<br /><br />4) Emmy Rossum has a SUPERIOR voice and is enchanting to look at.  Compare her voice - and the excellent pacing of her songs - with the play soundtrack.  I know this is heresy but Rossum is better.  Sorry fans.<br /><br />5) The orchestra is much larger and as such richer.<br /><br />6) Gerard Butler is, as mentioned, a very sexy Phantom.  His voice, while not opera quality is nonetheless powerful, deep, and commanding - a perfect Phantom voice.  After watching the movie several times, Michael Crawford (I know this is heresy) sounds like a teenager on the play soundtrack.  Sorry fans.<br /><br />7) Is the movie perfect?  No.  The sword fight is absurd and unnecessary.  The fall of the chandelier should have been better (watch Disk II for a better scene of the infamous fall!).<br /><br />8) All the versions of Phantom suffer from the following but few if any have commented: each of Christine's suitors treats her like an object and a child.  Even though the Phantom got my vote as The One To Run Off With in the movie, I fantasize about Christine dumping both guys and seeking a man who didn't objectify her!
015603008X|5.0|In the world that we live in, nothing is impossible. <br /> <br /> In Daniel Keyes' book, Flowers for Algernon, the \\"impossible\\" comes true. Despite the simple story, Keyes presents a tragic yet miraculous story that triggers feelings of anger, pity, and humor all at the same time. The unexpected plot twists keep the reader interested throughout the book. Keyes truly touches one's heart with the honest and direct feelings in his story and the valuable lesson it teaches. <br />  <br /> Charlie Gordon, the main character, is a mentally challenged, middle-aged man who worked as a sweeper at a nearby bakery. Although he faces discrimination, humiliation, and taunting from fellow workers, he does not realize them as such due to his limited IQ level. The tables turn, however, when Charlie is offered to participate in an experiment that will increase his IQ greatly. Previously only tested on a lab rat named Algernon, Charlie would be the first human to undergo the same procedure. This experiment successfully turns Charlie into a genius. Charlie is able to discover surprising details about his earlier life as well as a new love life. However, to his dismay, Charlie soon finds out that being smart is not everything. His newfound intelligence leads to an isolation much like his lack of intelligence had before. In the height of all the drama, Algernon the lab rat dies. <br /> <br /> Keyes used the technique of a journal entry to tell the story. The straightforward writing style effectively showed the metamorphosis of Charlie and the people around him. The technique of foreshadowing, which hints at what is to come, worked marvelously in this book to move the story along. But as the ending draws near, it is heartbreaking to see the deterioration of his newly gained intelligence fading more and more until it no longer exists.  <br /> <br /> Keyes sends many messages and emotions throughout the book, but it the honesty of his tone that makes this story both so believable and exciting. Because of this depth of emotion Flowers for Algernon, is one of the best books I have read.  <br />
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Capping off a year in which Shakira had the #1 single and album on the Latin charts and made history by becoming the highest charting Spanish album in Billboard history, Shakira delivers her second set of delights on this lavish and tasty set. <br /> <br />    It's hard to separate both \\"Fixations\\" Vol. 1 and 2, they are both different albums and even Shakira herself will tell you that they have no preset connection to one another. But take that concept away and listen to both as different albums, we can come to understand and appreciate them separately, because both albums have very distinct sounds. \\"Oral Fixation 2\\" is a traditional mixture (at least in her music) of College Rock and Dance Pop...and her 80's synth tones, first heard on \\"Vol. 1\\". However, this second set oozes with psycoanalitical and socialogic lyrics, spitting out venom about the world and certain governments in general. This in no way distracts from the beautiful production of the music, as it never overwhelms the music. Shakira obviously understands the balance that pop stars need to understand when making pop music and diving in to political subjects. You have to have lyrics that speak your truth but at the same time understand that the melody of the song needs to be solid enough to sell to the popular music world. \\"Oral Fixation 2\\" is a great example of this and stands out with great social conscious-pop records like Janet Jackson's \\"Rhythm Nation\\" and Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\". I'm glad Shakira knew what she was doing and understood that the MUSIC was the selling point...she could have easily crashed and burned and release a disastrous record. So many others have tried and failed to release social conscious pop but end up frustrating themselves and the market...who can remember Madonna's similiar attempt \\"American Life\\"?  <br /> <br />    This record is not entirely political...it sneaks in some beautiful love songs. My particular favorite and the song that stood out from the rest,probably because of its RnB influences, was the lovely \\"Dreams For Plans\\". Shakira's frustrations on love   <br />are beautifully spoken of when asking \\"Did I change my hopes for fears and my dreams for plans?\\". I'm sure this is a subject many people can identify with. And then of course there's the 2 English versions of songs first heard on \\"Fijacion Oral V. 1\\". \\"The Day and The Time\\" is nice..but the original \\"Dia Especial\\" is superior and also Gustavo Cerati's voice is much more evident. \\"Something\\" is lovely, but it lacks the passion of Shakira's voice in the original \\"En Tus Pupilas\\". Both songs are touching tributes to someone who has seeped in to your skin. <br /> <br />     I'm sure it will be a welcome suprise to many of her English fans who are expecting Shakira upbeat material. I'm sure people will be bopping to \\"Animal City\\" and the synth-pop \\"Timor\\". This album doesn't have any of that \\"la da da da do day\\" or Reggaeton babbling of \\"La Tortura\\" but it doesn't fail to make you want to shake your shimmy. You'll be happy to listen to a great pop album that doesn't try too hard to impress
B00000JR29|5.0|The biggest masterpiece from Tears For Fears is their 1985 album \\"Songs From The Big Chair\\", and a great chunk of the songs from this album were singles (for the exception of \\"The Working Hour\\", which is also a great song) and two of those songs went to no.1 and became mega hits. I think this album is also excellent because of Roland Orzabal's talent for songwriting and singing and Curt Smith also being a good singer and contributing to the songwriting on the album. The songs are great from track 1 to the last song on the album! <br /> <br />Thank You, Tears For Fears for making the best albums! : )
B000BJS4SU|2.0|not so impressed. john's playing is pretty much a slavish imitation of stevie ray vaughan on this disc. i'm sure he loves the music, so do i, but for god's sake at least wait until you have an original voice to contribute before you run the risk of being yet another pasty white trainspotter diluting the integrity of the blues as a musical artform. yeah i'd rather 15 year old girls listen to this and maybe go from this to srv, albert king and so on than listen to matchbox 20 or some garbage, but judged against real blues musicians this is just so bland and so contrived, it just shows a disrespect for the music.
B000001DU5|5.0|I recommend this collection because it has all of their great songs on it and there's not one that I don't like! I bought it because I wasn't really impressed with the 20th Century Masters collection. You should check this out and buy it before you decide on buying a cheap TFF compliation that can be easily found in a \\"clearance bin\\" in any record store!
B000000OSE|5.0|For the common rock fan, the term \\"Guns n' Roses\\" is synonymous with \\"Appettite for Destruction.\\"<br /><br />Rarely are the follow-up double albums, Use Your Illusion I & II even mentioned today among the casual fan.<br /><br />But, the diehard G'n'R fan such as myself know better. In the G'n'R fan forums of today, which together boast tens of thousands of daily visitors, the general consensus is that the Illusion albums deserve in their own right to be named one of hard rock's finest achievements.<br /><br />Critic reviews of the albums were poor due to both albums having a good amount of \\"filler\\" which I, even as the most hardcore of fans, find true. The Use Your Illusion's or UYI's for short, are not albums that I can find myself listening straight through like Appettite. In fact, I don't think I've ever even heard some of the songs more than once.<br /><br />But for those songs that have left a lasting impression, I will touch on them briefly.<br /><br />Use Your Illusion I is the harder rocker of the two Illusion's. Songs include:<br /><br />\\"Dust N' Bones\\" which is a fine example of a laid-back rocker that features a catchy end chorus long with a solid guitar solo.<br /><br />\\"Live N Let Die\\" - a single off the album and cover of the Paul McCartney classic. Although the studio version is nowhere near as good as seeing this song performed live, it'll still leave you with a desire to see the Bond flick.<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry\\" - Izzy's power ballad which features a very powerful message, a tear-dropping solo from Slash, and an absolutely memorable ending with both the majestic vocals and riffs.<br /><br />\\"Double Talkin' Jive\\" - an Izzy rocker that although only 2-3 minutes in length, makes you want more. A song that's expanded to 14-15 minutes in length live, DTJ is an absolute unknown as far as great g'n'r rockers go. The ending to the song features a Spanish guitar tune that is reminiscent of the Eagles' 'Hotel California.'<br /><br />\\"November Rain\\" - greatest ballad of all-time, no competition. No one who thinks November Rain is not a great song has heard it enough times to respect it for what it is - a masterpiece. Axl's ode to undying love is a build-up of majestic proportions. Everything about the song is perfect from its beginning piano piece to the slow vocal buildup to the guitar solos to the classic outro.<br /><br />\\"Coma\\" - my personal favorite G'n'R tune at the moment. If you haven't already listened to this song 3-5 times on full volume - please do so, I promise you that you won't be disappointed. The last 3 and 1/2 minutes of this song are simply rock n' roll at its purest. Axl's vocals in belting out what its like to live life like its a coma is truly unique even among G'n'R's catalogue.
B00006FM77|4.0|I saw Chicago in 1971 and 1972 at Arie Crown Theater in Chicago.  This is essentially the same show/s I saw and they were fabulous.  I remember I could hardly wait to get my hands on this Box of 4 LP's.  Deal was they were all warped to some degree.  Returned it, same deal.  With the CD's no worry about that!  Excellent!
0446310786|5.0|This book is my favourite book of all time. It's full of emotion, suspense, and action. When I first came across the book it was bound in the classic black cover. I instantly assumed that it'd be boring. Please don't make the same mistake I did!  <br /> <br />The story is narrated by Scout, a young girl who tries desperately to try to come to terms with the cruelty of the world. Her words are sometimes haunting, sad, and humourous. She encourages you to think differently about certain issues, and she opens you up to a different world.  <br /> <br />Harper Lee writes so flawlessly that it's no wonder this book won a Pulitzer Prize. My English teacher once said that the world is divided up between those that have read the book and those that haven't. I think that might've been a slight exaggeration but do pick up the book anyway. It's rare for a book to transcend time and still be relevant 45 years after it was first publised.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Miss Madonna is back in a HUGE way with this fabulous disco album.  I HATED \\"American Life,\\" but girlfriend redeemed herself.  I love that song \\"Hung Up\\" which samples that cute song by ABBA.  Madonna may be over the hill, but I love her because she is absolutely FIERCE!
B0000027RL|5.0|This is a great album.  I don't consider myself an expert of 90s rock or grunge, but love rock music from the late 60s and after.  So, coming from someone who is NOT a hardcore grunger, believe me when I say that `Ten' is awesome.   I have to join the crowd when I say that `Black' is one of the greatest songs I've ever heard.  Awesome keyboards & vocals highlight one of the greatest sad songs in rock history.   My other personal favorites on `Ten' include `Once', `Even Flow' and `Garden'-who can't love that screaming guitar late in the song on the last chorus?!!!  Honorable mention to `Release'.  'Ten' is a must have for all lovers of rock music, even folks over 40 like myself!! <br />
B000BP86OG|2.0|Entertainment Weekly was right on with their grade of \\"D+\\" for this CD.  I bought it because I liked the previous Darkness release, but this one veers strongly into silly hard rock that is at best annoying and at worst completely lacking in any entertainment value whatsoever.  There were moments on this CD where I heard traces of Boston, the \\"lite metal\\" of Scorpions or Def Lep, and most of all a whole lot of Queen.  Unfortunately they've captured only the SOUND of those bands without any of the sparkle or melodic skill that made them special.  I'm pretty amazed that there are people giving this album 5 STARS. (!!!????) It just goes to show, there's no accounting for taste (or a complete absence of it).
0385510454|1.0|And this is NOTHING like a great novel.  In fact, it is the unhappy marriage of a bad travelogue, poor Italian lesson, cut-out characters, predictable circumstances and a fizzled-out ending (on a par with \\"and then I woke up\\").  Waste of money, and not worth the time to find out how dreadful it was.  Not well written.  Not interesting.  Not exciting.  Not anything.
B00097DXZS|4.0|The Michelle Branch song 'Im Feeling You' is excellent....as is Trinity with Robert Randolph
B000BOH8XW|5.0|I became a fan of Shakira in the Laundry Service Era. I loved the CD even though I knew it was not her best. Then FO1 came. and I got eternally hooked with La Tortura (and its video). I was longing for the English counterpart and definitely I was surprised at the growth that Shakira has had. I cannot regret of any single song as far as music goes. I may regret of the lyrics at \\"How Do You Do\\". BUt still it's a great CD. I think I can't get enough of Hey You, Animal City, Dreams For Plans, Timor, Something, Don't Bother, and Costune Makes the Clown. <br />Definitely the best CD I've heard this year
0553801503|4.0|I have been waiting for this book for years and it was really good, except that only half the characters were in it. I am not sure that I am going to like reading the next book as it occurs at the same time as this book with the rest of the characters. I think it would have been much better to do them chronologically.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This has to be one of Michael Jackson's top 3 all-time greatest albums.  Before Michael became strange this album captures what the \\"King of Pop\\" is best at: Pop/R&B.  Carefully chosen tracks from proven songwriters (Carole Bayer Sager, Rod Temperton, Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney)and a few tracks of his own added to a brilliant producer are all the ingredients of a great album.<br /><br />Now, this disc has also been remastered par excellence!  I have never heard such a great sounding remastering job in my life and believe me I've heard too many pretenders and alleged remastering jobs that even sound worse than the pre-remastered version.<br /><br />The best tracks are the title track, \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\", and my favourite \\"Rock With You\\" but the other tracks, written by great hall-of-fame songwriters are great too and make the whole package cohesive and overall just a great album.<br /><br />For the diehard fan, there are even bonus outtakes and interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton although personally I feel they should have either left this out or put it on a separate disc but I guess I can always stop the disc after \\"Burn This Disco Out.\\"<br /><br />This is probably the best version of this album that's out there and is highly recommended for all MJ fans out there.
B000002L7Y|5.0|a-ha could have ended up a footnote from the 80's because of their breakout hit \\"Take on Me\\" - not because of the song or it's album: Hunting High and Low, but because of the award-winning video that it spawned. Images of pin-up lead singer Morten Harket dashing through a black and white cartoon backdrop will forever be associated with that song (and rightly so - it's an awesome video). In reality, a-ha is a far more talented group than many would have ever liked to state. However, even if you choose to dismiss them as so much fluff, THIS is the album that you need to have to keep in your 80's collection. However, I'd encourage you to dig deeper and you'll see how truly deep/talented this group actually is. <br /> <br />a-ha is far more than the sum of its parts. This is high praise since very few musical groups can survive the egos of their members. a-ha undoubtedly suffered from this malady as well: Harket's looks often were reason enough to dismiss the group as fluff and his appearance on the cover of more than one teen magazine during the 80's era could have brought the group crashing down. However, beyond the lead singer's model appearance was a songwriter extrordinaire! Harket and his bandmates Pal Waaktaar and Magne Furuholmen are an extremely (and though some might argue otherwise) consistently talented trio/group. <br /> <br />Hunting High and Low rocketed a-ha to fame. Was \\"Take on Me\\" a one time thing? No. <br /> <br />- Take on Me is the breakout hit from this album, but there are several others that are really amazingly full bodied and fully realized. <br /> <br />- The Sun Always Shines on TV (this was the second hit from this album)- Harket wants to know why everyone on television has a good and happy life when his is not. <br /> <br />- Living a Boy's Adventure Tale-  speaks about a homeless man's choice to view his life in a different light <br /> <br />- Blue Sky - ethereal and light, peppy song often dismissed as bubble gum, but if you listen to the lyrics you'll realize that Harket sings about how he must forge ahead happily even though others do not perceive him the way he hopes they will. <br /> <br />- I Dream Myself Alive - Harket sings about lost love and finding happiness afterward <br /> <br />These are not fluff pieces people (Homelessness being addressed in the early 80's?!). This is not a fluff group.  <br /> <br />I really recommend that you take a listen to this album and see if you don't realize the depth of this amazing group. <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|Ok, UHateMe \\"CarpetMuncher\\", one thing you have to understand is that there is no such thing as \\"real rock\\" and \\"fake rock\\".  Just because you have no liking for a band, which is fine, does not entitle you to ever criticize what other people enjoy listening to.  I personally feel that this is a great album, and yes, I do enjoy older (mid- to late-70s) rock and I still somehow found the ability within myself to buy and listen to this album and still love it for what it is.  Music.  And to say that this is \\"teeny-bopper\\" pop music for people who live with their parents and don't know anything beyond what's on the radio is completely untrue.  I'm 21, have moved out, and being a music major in college, I have a very good sense of other artists who will never make it to radio, and yet I still find this album to be a great one.  Being on the radio does not automatically make an album terrible, even though that is the case for some stations out there.  So for the love of God, just lighten up instead of taking music so seriously.  When you're all grown up and have stopped ranting about other people's tastes in music anonymously on the internet, you'll realize that you're not the all-knowing musical genius you think you are.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I thought The concert for Bangla Desh is a great double DVD to have, excellent performances etc. BUT after all these years waiting for it to be released on DVD in 5 channel sound (which is great)has Apple after spending so much time restoring it has it released only on 4:3 ratio when the original film was made in 70mm......we're missing out on 2/3 of the film footage, especially these days when most people are buying widescreen TVS. <br />Apart from that its worth buying. <br />A bit dissapointing Apple!! <br />
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I really really like this album, I loved the \\"old\\" John Mayer if thats what you call it, but I think that this new stuff is great, and I think that he is such a diverse artist he can really play anything, maybe some people don't like it because it not true \\"blues\\", but this album is John's own style he has always had kind of his own thing going. I think that it's great and I listen to it everyday. I just love how real of his songs are. After seeing him live you know that this is the real thing, he loves what he does. I love it, definatley one to buy for the collection.
B000B8QF14|4.0|This DVD/CD is a good album but it could be even better, i would preffer more old songs than the american idiot songs (like boulevard,etc.), now about and commercial world, this world is a complete *#! because they never cared about green day, this group has better dics, but this world only care about wath album sells better so they never care anything about green day but now that they have a \\"very commercial album\\" they care. <br /> <br />An example is shenanigans that was relased in 2002, most of people and fans of green day dont know that this album exist, but now whit american idot everybody talks about them. For all the fans of gren day: This group rocks but not the american idiot, if you are a new green day fan i would recomend the \\"dookie\\" or the \\"international duperhits\\" or the \\"insomniac\\" or if you want a live dics you can get this \\"a bullet in a biblie\\" but not the american idiot.
B00003CXAE|5.0|Okay, I am pretty sure everyone in the universe over the age of 25 has seen this movie. There are two people in this world, the kind that love musicals and the kind that dont. Within those groups are the people that love Grease or Hate it, the ones that hate it should stear clear of me because at any moment i might just bust out with \\"summer nights\\" or \\"hopelessly devoted\\" I have to admit that i always thought Olivia Newton John looked to old to be in high school, and her \\"danny\\" when she sees him in the parking lot after the game is hilarious. I was always in love with Kinicke not Danny, and I always wanted to be Rizzo not Sandy. My favorite song is \\"beauty school dropout\\" which is strange because its such a random point in the whole film, but i have many a times with my hairbrush belted out this song. The only song i dont like is \\"blue moon\\" its boring and \\"Tears on my Pillow\\" other than that its flawless.
B000089CJI|3.0|In a light melodic tone lead singer Benjamin Gibbard of the band Postal Service croons the phrase, \\"They will see us waving from such great heights.\\"  Yet with all their beautiful words and exotic tones, I did expect greater heights from this popular band.   <br /> The band Postal Service is made up of Gibbard, singer of the band Death Cab for Cutie, and Jimmy Tamborello from the band Dntl.   <br /> The album Give Up is a mixture of techno, pop and indie. When I first made my mom listen to it she immediately said, \\"This sounds like Depeche Mode.\\"  This album does have a Depeche Mode feel to it, with its erratic beats and melancholy lyrics, but there are some original sounds. <br /> I first heard the song \\"Such Great Heights\\" listening to an iPod on a bus.  I immediately fell in love with the strange and unique song.  I got the album as soon as possible, expecting other interesting songs.  After listening, somewhat painfully, to the entire album I was not really that impressed.  There were some intriguing songs like \\"Nothing Better\\" and \\"Recycled Air\\", but for the most part it was not on my Top Albums list. <br /> The words in this album sounded beautiful, but when you strung them all together there was not really much of a meaning.  For example in the song \\"We Will Become Silhouettes\\" it begins with, \\"I've got a cupboard with cans of food, filtered water and pictures of you and I'm not coming until this is all over.\\"   <br /> Sure these are interesting words, but why do I have to know about your cupboard?  I was expecting a little more depth.  I also felt like the singer was trying to squeeze too many words into one sentence.  This ruined the simplicity of the song and made it seem too wordy.   <br /> I do believe that this is an original band and not at all like other contemporary bands, but sometimes I wished that the band would pull out of their own style.  I would have liked to hear some songs different from their usual techno beats and scraping backgrounds.<br /> I do commend back up singer Jenny Lewis for adding colorful backgrounds.  Her feminine voice suited well with the voice of Gibbard.  I was very impressed by her voice in the song \\"Nothing Better.\\"  That song was my favorite from the whole album because it was a relief from the somewhat repetitive songs before it. <br /> This album is distinctive and absorbing, but do not go out of your way to buy it.   <br />
0743243315|1.0|I was really excited to read this book however after reading 50 pages, I was really disappointed.  I tried to force myself to keep reading, and finally last night I decided it is time to start reading a new book.  I have read 150 pages.  The book never got better.  Just because someone writes about a different subject doesn't mean the book is good.  The writing is really BAD.  I kept trying to reread sentences.  The grammer was really bad.  A friend told me that once she started reading the book faster, it was easier for her to read.   <br /> <br />I picked up \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" last night.  I have read the first 30 pages so far and am really excited about the book.  I can't believe I wasted the last week trying to continue reading \\"Brick Lane\\".  I really can't see why people like this book.  If I write about a different subject with no writing experience, will I win awards also?   <br /> <br />She writes similar to Chitra Divakaruni's writing which is very chopping and is probably a good first draft.  They should hire someone to clean up their writing.
B000B8QF14|4.0|Bullet in a Bible was an incredible DVD/CD combo. The live performance was incredible and fully energetic. Those guys definitely put on one hell of a show and this product is definitely worth buying if you're a hardcore Green Day fan. It was also nice to know these guys took it upon themselves to play some of their older songs (Brain Stew, Longview, Basket Case etc...). The CD's sound quality is also good for a live one. A few minor complaints though: Yes, I agree with the reviewer below who pointed out how Billie Joe makes the audience sing some parts of the songs. But that's the point of a live performance; to get the audience involved somehow so you will expect that. Also, to the reviewer who talked about giving money to charity instead of this DVD/CD; how about using your time working at a soup kitchen instead of writing reviews? Some of you guys have to stop dissing Green Day so much. You should only write a review if you are a fan of the band, not just some random guy who is pissed off at the world and feels the need to degrade something. Anyways, the DVD was great and I in fact enjoy some of the live adaptations of some songs, such as Longview. You know these guys are good if they're playing songs they performed in 1994/1995. I also liked the Good Riddance performance with the electric guitar, that was fresh. Purchase it if you can or get it somehow because you won't be dissapointed. Note to fans though: watch it without your parents obviously, because Billie Joe does a lot of goofy sh*t on stage (humping the stage floor and showing half of his a** during King for a Day). Another sort of dissapointment was it was ENGLAND. No offense to the English, but Green Day should have considered their AMERICAN fanbase. The only time he mentions America was when he yelled \\"I want you to sing so loud, that every f*ckin' redneck in America hears you\\". Otherwise, no problem. Get it if you can.
0440217563|5.0|This book has several very long reviews, so I will be brief. I just can't seem to get enough of Diana Gabaldon. If you were a fan of Outlander and Dragonfly in Amber, you will also enjoy this book. It took me over a week to read (unfortunately my job got in the way) and I savored every page. This is the continued saga of Jamie and Claire Fraser and their love and trust grows much deeper in this story. Voyager covers a lot of ground/ocean and moves like a whirlwind at times! There are a few weaknesses and unexplained events that have left  some questions in my mind. I can  only hope that they will be answered in her next book, Drums of Autumn. This book may not be perfect, but it was certaining entertaining and worth every one of those 5 stars!
B000002H70|5.0|I purchased this album when i was 16 years old. I was already a huge Cure fan, I already owned Boys Dont Cry, Three Imaginary Boys, Seventeen, Faith, Pornography, Japanese Whispers, The Top, Head on the Door (my 2nd fav), Kiss me kiss me kiss me, and the compilations. I loved them. But when Disintegration came out, It changed my perception of music alltogether. From the opening song, througout till the end there is not one throw away track, not a ONE! They all blend and shift and integrate themselves . It can be on permanent play in my cd player and i would never get tired of it, NO other album has ever had that distinction with me.
B000BJS4SU|3.0|Certainly not album of the year - but the name of the cd is TRY!  Kudos to John for doing what he wants do to, and not putting out another pop album despite the pressure to do so.  There is a great version of Somethings Missing on here, and potential to expose some non traditional listeners to Blues.

B0000024YL|5.0|My dad had this album when it first came out so I grew up with it.  I then had my own vinyl copy. When CD's starting arriving on the scene I knew it was one of the first that I wanted on disc. This is a classic of their best and a must have in any music collection!
B000002KCI|5.0|In my humble opinion, \\"Zuma\\" is one of Neil's most enjoyable and listenable albums that showcases his various talents.  We get pensive acoustic Neil (\\"Pardon My Heart\\"), hopeful romantic Neil (\\"Lookin' For A Love\\"), grunge forefather Neil (\\"Drive Back\\"), and yes, even drunk poet Neil (\\"Barstool Blues\\").  Somehow it all fits together as a sort of perfect sampling of 1970's Neil Young, which by the way, is the best kind of Neil Young.<br /><br />As for Neil's lyrics on \\"Zuma,\\" they show how loss can co-exist with hope, but the outcome is never certain.  The subject shifts on this album depicting scenes from the endless human drama -- man does his brothers and sisters wrong, gets intoxicated to forget about it, then stares in the mirror and swears not to do it again.  And my favorite, \\"Danger Bird\\" puts all those feelings of regret in one song: \\"With the rain pounding on his back, he recalls the moment that he cracked... long ago in the museum with his friends.  And like those memories the rain keeps pounding down, down, down.\\"  Neil's guitar screams with a classic, treble-drenched solo like an exclamation point.  It doesn't get better than this.  I love it for its naked truth.<br /><br />If you're an old Neil Young fan, like myself, you probably already own this LP.  I recommend you buy the CD version and relive the music.  If you're a new fan of Neil Young and are unfamiliar with his works from the 1970's, Zuma is an enjoyable CD with some great rock tunes that will not leave you disappointed.
0790733226|2.0|In Contact, Jodie Foster plays Ellie Arroway, a <br />briiliant astronomer, maybe the smartest woman in the <br />whole world. Mathematics and science are every bit as <br />natural to Ellie as knitting a scarf or whipping up a <br />souffle. Ellie's on a one-woman mission to <br />find intelligent life somewhere out in the cosmos. It <br />sure ain't in this movie. Here's how she quantifies <br />her excitement: <br /> <br />\\"You know, there are four hundred billion stars out <br />there, just in our galaxy alone. If only one out of a <br />million of those had planets, and just one of out of a <br />million of those had life, and just one out of a <br />million of those had intelligent life; there would be <br />literally millions of civilizations out there.\\" <br /> <br />OK, here's what I get: \\"one out of a million\\" of four <br />hundred billion leaves you with 400,000. So before you <br />even get to the second \\"one out of a million\\" you are <br />out of millions to get one out of. This is not even <br />close, and would probably get you a summer in remedial <br />math at even a crappy public high school.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I waited a while to see The Passion of the Christ so that I could approach it fairly and without the shouting of the faithfull/unfaithfull clogging up my ears. Recently, I was amazed to read Roger Ebert's 4-star review, which stated it was a great film simply because Ebert believed in what he was seeing and the film depicted that. So, I got it, saw it, and, . . .not so fast Mr. Ebert.<br /><br />Let me take this thing apart from several angles. For production, the film was nicely shot and adequate, and overall, the shots of Jerusalem type surroundings were effective. But the entire film was very cramped, and the only drammatic sequences that worked well for me were the scenes with Pontious Pilate. The film uses a  broad brush of color and myst; this reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings, and I half expected Frodo and Golom to appear at any time. Its constant use of slow motion to accentuate the beatings and whippings was very distracting, and the usual heavenly music competed with memories of The Ten Commandments. From these perspectives, Jerusalem in the Kingdom of Heaven was a powerful and beautiful film, which also gave the city a memorable singularity and grace. I also rewatched Barrabas, an earlier epic that more creatively and poignantly tells and shows this story, and at least, with more interest.<br /><br />As Jesus, James Caviezel has a handsome and photogenic face; kind of a Charlton Heston replacement with chiseled, monumental features. (He was marvelous in The Thin Red Line.) He looks like those Jesus pictures that people expect to see in a minister's office. In this film, however, Caviezel is constantly looking either very focused and silent or very confused and silent. He says little, but apparently this means a lot. When he gets whipped and beaten, which is often, it hurts, and he shows it, as most of us would. When I sum up the character in total, however, I am left with a rather empty shell of a portrayal. For those who know this story, explanations aren't necessary, and this is all Gibson gives the viewer. All the other characters, including the Romans, fall into stereotypical grieving, brave Mary, hysterically grinning, laughing, and ponderoulsly cruel Romans, cunning and slithering Jewish prelates, mournfully sad looking apostles, and a devil who looks suspiciously like Marilyn Manson (with snakes). Only Judas and Pontious Pilate have particlular roles that intrigue and question, but Gibson is too in love with the blood of Jesus and the leering of others to let them have much screen time. I wasn't left with any conviction that these people were real or that the event was any more worthy than the millions murdered over the millenia.<br /><br />The script was written for the faithful. What does this mean? If you go into most medieval churches in Europe, you sill see the renditions of the Christ story by the great painting masters of their time; you see the suffering of Christ, the crucifiction of Christ, Christ carrying the cross, the Resurrection of Christ, and so on. This film is merely a modern extension of those themes, and nothing else. I wanted to come away from this film with a new feeling, an insight into this story, which is entirely based on belief and with no archeology or record to support it. Pasolini's St. Matthew film portrays a believable Jesus, Barrabas gives us an intellectual and epic story of a man's journey to belief, and even M. Scorcese's film asks questions about the life of Jesus. None of this is in this film, just blood, more blood, flayed flesh, and more blood.

B00005JKCH|3.0|With the recent resurgence of comic book popularity, it seemed only a matter of time before Marvel's classic heroes got their movies, just as DC's did.  First came the spectacular blockbuster X-Men.  After that rousing success, who could doubt that Spider-Man would be just as amazing? <br />Unfortunately, while the movie was a smash hit, it is not nearly up to the standards true fans set.  The actors are competent, but with the possible exception of Defoe as Norman Osborne and the man who plays Jameson, none are outstanding.  The visuals are sweet, but again, no surprises.  The story is well-done, but not brilliant.  See what I'm getting at? <br />So, while this isn't an exceptional movie, it IS quite good and a good gift item.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|Just simply put....a great performance by the BEE GEES!!!!  I work out watching them perform and they just keep me working harder as I can't tear myself away from watching and listening to them.  Just a great DVD that is well worth every penny!!!
B00000IBRX|1.0|I had a hard time following the sub-plot of constant flashbacks.  However, if you watch this for theological insights, you will be misled. <br /> <br />Theological Mistakes: <br /> <br />#1. Hell is not about judgement.  If you believe that, how can you claim to be Christian?  Romans 5:12 \\"Sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin.\\"  1 John 3:8 \\"He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.\\"  But the good news is that Jesus died on the cross.  1 John 1:7 \\"The blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from every sin.\\"  Galatians 3:13 \\"Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us.\\" <br /> <br />#2. Where is God in this movie?  Christopher, the main character played by Robin Williams, says that he NEEDS his wife so he can be happy.  So, he doesn't God to be happy?  Heaven, in a matter of speaking, is the presence of God.  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character thought that God's presence even in heaven is removed from the people in heaven.  God says in Psalm 16:11 \\"You fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures at your right hand.\\" <br /> <br />#3 & 4 No one from heaven can rescue anyone in hell, plus no one going back to earth would do any better at convincing an unbeliever if that unbeliever does not accept Jesus without stuff like that.  Luke 16:22-31 \\"The time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried. In hell, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away, with Lazarus by his side. So he called to him, 'Father Abraham, have pity on me and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in agony in this fire.'  \\"But Abraham replied, 'Son, remember that in your lifetime you received your good things, while Lazarus received bad things, but now he is comforted here and you are in agony.  And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, so that those who want to go from here to you cannot, nor can anyone cross over from there to us.'  \\"He answered, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house, for I have five brothers. Let him warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment.'  \\"Abraham replied, 'They have Moses and the Prophets; let them listen to them.'  \\" 'No, father Abraham,' he said, 'but if someone from the dead goes to them, they will repent.'  \\"He said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead.' \\"
B000002LCI|5.0|I have known and loved DM ever since \\"Master and Servant\\" became a hit in Europe, where I was a teenager at the time. So I was quite familiar with their music by the time \\"Music for the Masses\\" came out. This album has 6 fantastic songs, among them arguably their best song ever, \\"Strangelove\\". The good songs, in order: <br /> <br />1. Never Let Me Down Again: a great song, dark and moody. I have not realized the deeper meaning of the lyrics for years (addiction), but I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br />2. The Things You Said: Nice emotional ballad, good song with great, honest lyrics. <br /> <br />3. Strangelove: If you don't know Depeche Mode, this is the first song you have to listen to. A perfect combination of Dave's humongous voice with a very driving and dynamic synth based sound. It just kicks ass! 'Course the lyrics are cool as always. <br /> <br />4. Little 15: a very honest and somber song. Reproducing teenage angst is one of DM's strong suites. <br /> <br />5. Behind the Wheel: Another great dynamic DM song. Great samples, one of their most danceable songs. <br /> <br />6. I Want You Now: It is one of their more straightforwardly themed songs. No need to guess what this song is all about. But that is exactly why it is so much fun. <br /> <br />\\"Music for the Masses\\" was a slight improvement over \\"Black Celebration\\", their best effort to date. The subsequent \\"Violator\\", although a large commercial success, was a slightly weaker album, and changed their sound from what I consider the real DM one, that is, sound based on synths and clean, unusual samples. It went all downhill after Violator...
0385504209|5.0|A book of such magnitude should be lauded for its complexity and the author's wit and research.<br /><br />Brown obviously spent quite a bit of time familiarizing himself with France, The Louvre, Leonardo Da Vinci, The Holy Bible and the secret societies of Europe. Kudos to Brown!<br /><br />Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, is lecturing in Paris when the curator of the Louvre contacts him and requests a meeting. Sauniere is murdered before Langdon can meet with him though, and mysteriously enough Langdon becomes the chief suspect in the crime.<br /><br />The symbologist must unlock clues in search of an elusive secret; a search that includes Sauniere's granddaughter Sophie. The curator has left several clues concerning his involvement in/with an elite secret brotherhood that has sworn to keep the earth shattering secret.<br /><br />The author keeps the reader immersed in the book with the continuous plot changes, upbeat tempo and interesting history of location and item.  I have recommended this book to friends and will do the same here!
068987474X|1.0|i read the first 3 pages of this book and concluded that this guy's an idiot. he's obnoxious and sarcastic. his writing style is such that you wish he were talking to you so you could slap him because it's so inconsiderate! the book starts with these women writing him sincere questions, and since he doesn't really know what he's talking about, he just makes fun of them, and does so in an unfunny way. i mean, he could have made the book humorous, but the sarcasm kills it. don't waste your time with this. if you want a real read, with real humor, read sex and the city.
B0002XL35G|5.0|you guys just dont get it, this is all about cinematography and unpredictable storyline, this is a very unconventional movie, this aint also about fast cars, this is a movie with brain, you have to use your brain to understand the message, if you dont get it then fine, go watch some action flicks or teeny bopper love stories, but anyway enough about that. <br /> <br />I'm just amazed with the 20 minute dialogue between travis and jane, just recently watch the DVD and found out that, that scene alone just takes 1 take to shoot, wow... that scene just proves how great Nastassja as an actress, she's not just a pretty face but also a damn pretty good actress.  <br />
1400101301|1.0|Rebecca Burns kills this beloved classic with her dull, lifeless, monotone reading. After listening for 5 minutes, my 12 year old daughter's immediate reaction was: \\"Whoever's reading this sounds like she's really not interested in the story at all! The voice sounds like a computerized voice.\\" <br /> <br />If you want this story on audio, find another version with a different reader.
B00005JMYI|3.0|The Legend of Ron Burgundy has it's high and low moments, some moments are genuinely funny, other moments are a bunch of dirty jokes that make you smile and the rest is a little dull. Will Farrell, Christina Applegate and all of the others do well in this film, but there just isn't that much to work with.<br /><br />The high point of the film is when Ron plays his Jazz flute in the club, that part was hilarious and my favorite part of the film. Like I said, there are a few other highlights, Ron throws a burrito out the window and hits biker Jack Black, and like when one of Ron's co-workers wears his sex panther cologne that smells like \\"a turd covered in burnt hair\\" among other things. These parts are hilarious!<br /><br />The soundtrack to the film is amazing; some of the best 70's music in one collection. Farrell and three other co-workers show off their singing ability by singing a version of \\"Afternoon Delight\\".<br /><br />Overall a good film, mainly for fans of Will Ferrell. If you like comedy movies that are what you see, this film is for you. If you want a deep story with a moral this ain't for you. Just fun, nothing more
B000001FZK|5.0|It's not easy, not to say contradictory in terms to write a review of this album. Beeing alongside its predecessor one of the eight, ten albums that definitely have had the most influence on me, since i've listened to them probably close to, if not more than a thousand times each.  <br /> On Party's over you might find some similarities with contemprary bands such as the human league or duran duran, but in my opinion they took off already at It's my life. We all know the story of how Mark Hollis just kept expanding the orchestra as his records made big hits, and i heard him say in an interview that on Spirit of Eden, he finally arrived where was heading on the preious three albums, so the choice was to disband, or experiment. He chose the latter, and Laughing stock are the fruits of that decision. If you count, the \\"verses\\" on Asecension day are cut by one bar each (10-9-8...), a trick Hollis only informed some of the musicians about, cauising other to be on a backbeat on some of the verses. The record is full of it, the \\"solo\\" on After the flood is TIm Firese Greene walking along the studio floor, stumling upon an electric guitar wired-up at ten on a Marshall amp, causing a wall of feedback. <br /> So, yes, it's not a complete and ultimately subtle record as Spirit of Eden, but it offers years and years of delightful musical safari.
0060899190|5.0|PostSecret: Extraordinary Confessions from Ordinary Lives was by far one of the best books I have bought in long time. This book was entertaining from conver to cover, and makes for a great converstaion piece. Hearing about so many different secrets and seeing the art work the goes along with each one, makes this book truely unique! I HIGHLY recommend this book whether it's for your coffee table, or a gift, or for you to hide in your night stand so you don't feel so guilty about your own secrets.
0312954468|5.0|I can't say that I've read all 207 of the other reviews at this point, though I might at some point.  So if I accidentally rehash what someone else has said, I apologize.<br /><br />This book wasn't in the \\"history\\" section when I found it--it wasn't even under \\"historical fiction\\".  It was in the \\"fiction\\" section.  Therefore I see no problem with historical inaccuracies.  Who's to say that many of these things didn't exist as Smith has written them?  I have not researched the history behind the Hyksos army and their assault on Thebes--though I know via Alex Trebek that it did occur--and so I won't argue that Smith is perfectly accurate.  But he's entitled to change things around for the sake of the story.<br /><br />I read this book when I was eleven, then again when I was fifteen, and now that I'm in college I enjoy it at least four times as much as I did in grade school.  I think that (with the possible exception of Simkin in the Weis-Hickman Darksword Trilogy,) Taita is my absolute favorite literary character.  Sure, you can claim that so many skills in a thirty-year-old slave are impossible.  Sure, you can call him egotistical and unvelievably intelligent.  But putting aside all that (because honestly, who is going to believe that Lostris is as absolutely perfect and beautiful as described?), Taita is a fantastically round character.<br /><br />About the suggestion that a romantic liason between Taita and another woman would make for a happier ending... it just didn't happen for either (a) a slave or (b) a eunuch to consort with a woman in those days.  The woman wouldn't think of it, the man wouldn't think of it... it just wouldn't happen.  Taita is completely and totally devoted to Lostris; she begins the story, and her death ends it; without his love for Lostris, there is no story for Taita to tell.  That's another reason I love Taita.  He is tortured by his love for Lostris, and though she knows it, she thinks nothing of it until the very end.  He is both mentally and sexually attracted to her, but because he is not of the Thebes nobility (and later because she is Pharoah's wife), he will never have anything to do with her socially, and in fact would rather remain her slave than become a lowly free man, banned from her presence.  And because he is a eunuch (caused, by the way, because he preferred the company of a companion slave girl to that of his pederast master) he will never, ever have anything to do with her sexually.

And because he is a eunuch (caused, by the way, because he preferred the company of a companion slave girl to that of his pederast master) he will never, ever have anything to do with her sexually.

B00005JN0T|4.0|This is movie was as good as I hoped it would be. Since it was written by the man who wrote The Minority Report, my favorite book, I expected great things from this movie and that's exactly what I got. The story never dulled, from start to finish, this film was excellent and action packed. Will Smith does a great job in lead.<br /><br />The robots really are the stars of the film; they are done very well and very entertaining to watch. Every minute the robots are shown, it just makes the film all that more entertaining.<br /><br />If you love good Scifi movies, you have found it here.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I think you need to be in an older age group to enjoy this movie.  My brother, my sister and I, all in our 40's, thought this movie was a riot.  My children in the early teen years thought it was totally lame.  They'll see the humor later, when they get older. <br /> <br />Vote for Pedro!!
B000BJS4TO|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect of the soundtrack to the motion picture \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\". The film's Japanese setting leads one to expect an extremely Oriental sound and yet John Williams as the composer(major works include Star Wars and Jurassic Park) suggested a more western, epic sound. I was pleasantly surprised that both expectations were met.<br /><br />Williams does a great job of mixing tradition Japanese instruments with standard orchestral pieces. The music is epic but without the bombastic flourishes that are typical of Williams' work.<br /><br />Yo-Yo Ma and Perlman feature on various solos throughout the soundtrack. The two artists are perfect in that they have created a balanced tension in their work. Each artist contributes a character theme and these themes crop up throughtout the score.<br /><br />Overall the soundtrack is a pleasing affair. The music is relaxing, often tracks will feature soft strings and the simple sounds of Japanese shamisen and slight taiko drums before building up into a soft wave of melody.<br /><br />\\"Memoirs..\\" is a fantastic soundtrack that hints at great things  for the film. RECOMMENDED!
B00099BPP6|5.0|It took amazon ages to release this excellent Rigoletto but now it's here and it offers one of the warmest accounts of this opera. <br /> <br />Fischer-Diskau is far from a Verdian baritone but this role more than any other allows different interpretations and somehow his most sympathetic characterisation made me care for Rigoletto. It's pleasant that he can't bark like others but he can't be the nasty Rigoletto we should be introduced to in the beginning of the work either. Lets say that he's a good alternative to the classic Cappuccilli, Bastianini, Merrill, Bruson. <br /> <br />La Scotto is heard here in her signature role and she surely doesn't dissapoint. Even if I can't endure her metallic voice for long, it's hard to deny the singing is exceptional. I'd compromise with her sound and vote for her as the best Gilda if it wasn't for Mariella Devia who offers everything Scotto does plus a creamy, focused top.  <br /> <br />This was the recording that introduced me to Bergonzi's magic. When he completed parmi veder le lagrime, I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. It sounds asif he distils Verdian essense from every single note the duke sings. And honeyed tone makes the experience a dream. I wonder why Maddalena didn't fall for him too! Cossotto and Vinco splendidly sing their minor but important parts and give an extra polish to the ensembles.  <br /> <br />Kubelik deserves the praise he gets for he offers drama, force and lyricism and controls the Scala forces even in the difficult parts. Don't miss it!

0446677450|5.0|I was motivated to write this review after reading another which said that Robert's information is \\"dangerous\\" in that he suggests that one can become rich while still young with little hard work instead of following the usual advice of go to school and get a good job.  What's really dangerous are these naysayers who teach our children the myths that \\"it takes money to make money\\" and \\"the rich get richer\\" and \\"you can't get rich.\\"<br /><br />Here's my story:  On June 22, 2002, I was broke with $18 to my name.  On August 17, 2003, just under 14 months later, I retired at the age of 30.  I never have to work again if I don't want to.<br /><br />I credit two authors for this: Napoleon Hill, who gave me the proper mindset to succeed, and Robert Kiyosaki, who gave me the \\"how-to.\\"  The reason I was broke with $18 was because of two previous failures in starting a business.  I read all of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series (at the library as I was too broke to buy the books) and realized what I had been doing wrong.  I applied what I learned from Robert and as a result my third try at starting a business has been immensely successful.  In fact, 2006 is shaping up to be a mind-boggling year for me in terms of growth and income.<br /><br />Note with great benefit that I applied the books to entrepreneurship.  There seems to be a fantastic myth that these books are only about buying rental properties.  Nothing could be further from the truth (and it goes to show that Robert's critics have not actually read the books in their entirety).  Robert has repeatedly said he uses rental real estate as an example simply because it's the easiest model of cash flow to explain.  I personally found the information to be far more applicable to starting and running a business than to buying rental properties.<br /><br />When I read the negative reviews, I must assume that those who write them are very small-minded and cannot see the possibilities and priceless information contained within the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series.  Like I said, I applied what I learned to entrepreneurship and am now wealthy as a result.  And, as I say in my own writings, everything comes down to ACTION.  You'll never get anywhere if you merely read and say, \\"Oh, that won't work for me.\\"<br /><br />Read these books.  Go to the library if you must, like I had to because I was broke.  Start with this one and read the entire series in order.  Apply what you learn and you will not regret it.  This 32-year old retiree promises you that much.I said, I applied what I learned to entrepreneurship and am now wealthy as a result.

Snowy White is solid and Doyle Bramhall II just burns it up on some of David Gilmours solo parts. <br /> <br />an amazing performance of some incredible songs.  GET IT!!
0553801503|5.0|As a huge fan of the series, reading all the reviews here saying \\"there isn't enough\\" or \\"where are my favorite characters\\" is extremely tedious and downright boggling.  George Martin is a great writer.  His world is fantastic.  All the characters are interesting in their own way and Martin takes great pains to make sure none of them are cliched.  He guides us through a rich world full of history and depth in a masterful, exciting way, and best of all, every bit of it is entirely unpredictable.  Every character is fair game for the chopping block, none of them make the decisions you expect them too, and he deftly introduces one scene to the next while alluding to other scenes from other character POVs.  He does not deviate at all from his style in Feast for Crows.  <br /> <br />To me, I can go on forever reading the tales of this fantasy world and I want George Martin to continue writing about it.  I like all the characters he chooses for chapters and am interested in all of their fates.  Each one's adventures all contribute to the whole of events happening in Westeros and beyond even if the reader does not know that.  But isn't that the point?   <br /> <br />For all you readers wanting more from Feast, just relax, it's Martin's world to breathe life into, we're just the fortunate people who get to witness it.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|Tarantino once said he loved Vanilla Ice.  I always thought it was an inside joke, because like Ice, Tarantino became famous as much for material borrowed, as created. <br /> <br />In 10 years, people will not even know what Tarantino was referring to in Pulp Fiction, what he was paying meticulous homage to in Kill Bill.  His 'source material', will be forgotten.  What a pleasure it is though, in Kill Bill, to cite his references, and recognize the feel of this film from 70s b-movies and 'exploitation' films. <br /> <br />The plot and characters, are in service of style.  In this way too, Tarantino closely follows his idol Depalma, who stole from Hitchcock in an almost fetishlike obsession, just as QT steals from everyone else.  Like Depalma, in say Dressed to Kill, all elements of story, are mere slaves to the dual gods of technique and image.  In this, Kill Bill is stunningly successful.
B00004S35Z|5.0|This was the second of 3 albums in a row to win the album of the year Grammy for Stevie, (as well as best male vocal performance for the album, and best male R&B vocal performance for `Boogie on reggae woman') and it's easy to see why.

0679422714|5.0|As exposed in this book, Mao was a blood-thirsty tyrant who didn't care about anything but his own personal power.  At every step of his career, he manipulated those around him, destroyed those who could not be manipulated, trampled those who he claimed to support, and destroyed the culture of China.  In fact, Mao is responsible for more Chinese deaths than World War II.  What is really interesting is that he controlled those around him with fear.  To instill this fear, he created an environment in which those who don't support him are his enemies.  Those who spoke out against his disasterous policies were liquidated.  This biography serves as a fine example of what happens when people give into fear.  Something which we in the United States are in danger of.  Pick up this book and find out what a country lead by fear can lead to.

And at the end You have to think its the one character, nbut we talked about it and it couldnt have been him.  I wont give it away, not like some PEO_PLE on this site who never heard of SPOILERS!<br /><br />i love kenvin Spacey event hough i don t like all his movies of some of his ACTIN Choices (thats a tem from acting class).<br /><br />So after we saw it my frinds and me came up with the name \\"Shunshee Copper\\" and were going to do a movie satirical on this movie.<br /><br />Also, the title comes from an old movie starring Cagney!!!
B0007Y08I8|2.0|I used to be a big fan of \\"South Park\\". Then after I felt it ran its course after a couple seasons, it kept going and going and going, so eventually I stopped watching it (not having cable helps a lot). Anyway, \\"Team America\\" came out on DVD and I felt that since this was supposed to be a little more \\"sophisticated\\" than \\"South Park\\", I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Amazingly, except for their parody of \\"Rent\\", the entire film was way too serious and straight and the novelty of having marionettes wore off after a few minutes. I was bored. I sped through the end. Sorry.<br /><br />Also, Trey Parker and Matt Stone should really work on some different character voices. All of their character voices sound like Terrance and Philip, and although those voices seem to work for those obnoxious characters from \\"South Park\\", they come off as extraordinarily irritating in \\"Team America\\".

B000A7S4B0|4.0|I agree with everyone who says the record companies are screwing with people's free right to get music.  However, take it up with your congressman.  Otherwise, throw down 15 bucks for a good CD.  Sometimes you have to toss your principles aside for the sake of your own enjoyment.  Unfortunately its the world we live in. <br /> <br />    Beside all that however there is an album(which everyone has stated) which is a totally new direction for the band.  Yet if you are looking for originality within B.R.M.C then you are looking in the wrong place. They have always been derivative of classic bands so why would they stop now with a different sound. The point is they make music that is consistently enjoyable.  <br />     <br />   I listened to album at first and disregarded it as an attempt to stray from their obvious britpop influences of the past two records.  I actually threw it in my \\"Dissapointed(sic) Pile\\" of records that I hoped would be better.  A couple of months later I pulled it out again to give it another chance and it hit me; as long as I KNOW I'm not listening to Muddy Waters and such...why not enjoy it for what it is.  It's three guys who love the music of our past and do a damn good job re-interpreting it. Just let the music be on its own without \\"F-ing\\"  over analysing everying so much...at least that's what I think.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|Simply the best...Madonna's best that is.  This is an excellent dance CD.  I often find myself swaying and grooving to the beat while I'm driving.  It's contagious and a treat for the ears.
B000007NZ5|4.0|Muscially speaking, this album is the strongest recording Black Sabbath released after the Ozzy/Dio eras (and better than some of those albums, too). Tony Iommi is the master of those dark, pummeling, sludgey guitar riffs. Headless Cross is, musically, arguably the best example of that guitar sound that is a trademark of the Sabbath sound. The keyboards are more prominent here than on other Black Sabbath discs but that's not a bad thing - in this case, I thought the keyboards really enhanced the music on this.  <br /> <br />It begins with the haunting keyboards that is a prelude to the heavy, slow-paced title track. Devil and Daughter is another GREAT, upbeat riff that is perfectly complimented with the keyboard work of Geoff Nicholls (why was that musician rarely tabbed as an official member of Sabbath?). When Death Calls starts off slowly with the emphasis on atmosphereic keyboards and a simple guitar melody and BOOM! - another heavy riff and operatic Martin vocals - finishes out as another upbeat track though not quite the way Devil and Daughter does. Most of the other tracks have good riffs and that dark, heavy guitar sound that are some of Iommi's best musical efforts.  <br /> <br />Tony Martin is a great singer. Black Sabbath does not begin and end with Ozzy or Dio on vocals. Iommi is the heart and soul of Black Sabbath. Laurence Cottle's bass work is excellent on Headless Cross, and he sounds very similar in style to Geezer Butler. Cozy Powell is one of the greatest drummers of all time, and his contributions here in terms of production and drumming really helped Black Sabbath regain some status they had lost as the band had really become a Tony Iommi solo project with the guitarist as the sole original member.  <br /> <br />My high rating for this album of for the music ONLY. Occultish lyrics have been another Sabbath trademark, and I would personally prefer to have had the band record this fine piece of music without Satan and his cronies getting a namecheck on almost every song. But musically, the instrumentation on this is great.
0553801503|5.0|this book is the transition between the chaos of the first narrative cycle of this series and what appears to be the buildup towards the conclusion.  I thought this was VERY DEFT on his part.   <br /> <br />He focused on the king's landing crowd.  On the further breakdown of the status quo, of the recognized order.  When things fall apart they often do some from entropy, accumulated drag, and that is what this novel seems to relate.   <br /> <br />* The rise of a fundementalist religion <br />* The gutting of any honor left to the Lannister's by Cerrsei.   <br />* A road trip by breinne that I think tells you in an indirect way what things are like outside of the major cities <br />* A building up of the forces that are likely to be fighting over the corpse <br />* Hints hints hints about those characters who WERE NOT detailed in this 1/2 of the story <br /> <br />Think of this as a bridge novel.  A breath between arias.  I think this was VERY intentional.  And throw in some terrific threads about the Iron Throne, Sam the Slayer, Arya (great stuff) and Jaime (where will he fit into all this?). <br /> <br />I think people discount this subtlety of this book.  The points and plot elements that he has introduced here i think are critical to what is to come.  It needed doing, and I give GRR credit for tightening things up while still telling a terrific story. <br /> <br />oh yes, and don't count on Brienne being \\"dead\\"  She still has promises to keep to cat.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I am completely dissapointed by this movie, after having read all these positive reviews I had to check out the movie.  <br />Basically there was not one thing in the movie that wasnt tacky. Its all the typical horrormovie elements that might scare an 8 year old but for an adult it made me laugh more than anything considering how ridiculous most of the scenes and storyline is(and not mentioning the bad acting).  <br />Another problem with old movies is that by now the effects of the 70s are just so ridiculously bad that it really makes you laugh more than anything else. While it might have caused more of a scare 20 years ago, looking at it now is just ridiculous. <br />Not even the storyline of this movie was excused from a bad review, the whole climax of the movie is just waaaay to short. As soon as the main character finds out about the witches the movie ends after like 10 min of a pathetic showdown between the main witch and the girl.  <br />I think real horrorfans nowadays should look at some Japanese and South Korean movies because they seem to be the ones making intelligent horrormovies. I highly recommend \\"a tale of two sisters\\". An intricate plot and a great psychological thriller/horror movie which will have you pondering over it for a long time. <br />For Suspiria, dont waste your money like I did.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|When going into this movie keep in mind  <br /> <br />BURTON + DEPP = CREEPY DARK GOTHIC DRAMA <br /> <br />* For shiny stories and happy orange Oompa Loompas please look under Gene Wilder <br /> <br />OK That's out of the way. <br /> <br />There are some light-hearted moments, like when we first see Wonka, his first shop, the cream tanks, Wonka telling Mike to `stop mumbling', Charlie's reason of candy, the utterly ramshackle Bucket house and Charlie's grandparents. Fans of the old movie recognize most of these as carry-overs. There are also new aspects to the story the broadened the tale such as actually seeing the fates of the children & Charlie's family, and Wonka's motivations. <br /> <br />This Wonka though is a self-absorbed, self-centered, and uncomfortable with anyone human. I found it hard to believe Wonka really cared about anyone but himself once he closed up his factory. Depp did a great job of pulling that off but the character, I never saw Depp I saw Wonka, but Wonka himself was hard to suffer as he bumbled about looking like he wanted nothing more than to hide or at least find some disinfectant spray. <br /> <br />Most(what appeared to be) attempts at humor fell flatter than Oprah off the empire state building, such as the doll hospital. Many aspects were clunky and felt forced, such as almost every scene with Christopher Lee, Veruca's restraint by squirrel & daddy's pathetic rescue attempt (The friggin' gate was 3feet high. Climb over, you pompous twit.), the initial Wonka-vater scene and it's futher use, and the entire ending. <br /> <br />The original, Wonka, was a light romp with brief moments of dark surreality and scariness focusing on Charlie; while Charlie is a dark surreal oft disturbing movie with brief moments of light focusing on Wonka. With this looking glass aspect one can respect the movies as separate beings but beyond that do not compare the two or you will have a hard time watching this movie. I give it points for cinematography, effects, and adding new aspects but take away most because this whole movie felt like if you looked over the right wall, you'd find Neverland Ranch.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|Try compiling a modest collection of, say, 12 tracks of Bob's greatest songs since the mid 1970s and it soon becomes apparent how much fertility was in the whipper snipper in the 60s. Don't get me wrong. I have dipped into stuff from throughout a career that has accompanied me throughout my maturity. And, yes, I did take succour from,'Time Out of Mind', and'Love and Theft'. There's always something worth listening to on a Bob outing. But we no longer expect, with baited breath, the next move. Scorcese has the same enthusiasm for the prodigious early Bob as all of us that have committed those formative songs to the soundrack of our adolescence. How we were infatuated with the androgny of that face, the eyelids closing as the heavily vowelled rhymes found their way to us. Was this a blokey thing?As a stylist, we took his taste in clothes, and his put-downs of interviewers sent us into delerium. There were no false moves. But you can tell, with the marvels of 20/20 rear vision, that nearing the end of this brilliant doco. if ever a lad was cruising for a bruising, it was Bob. No matter how trifling the bike accident might have been to cause his retirement from the hurly burly of public life, it was just in the nick of time. Sagacious Bob provides the glue to the footage, looking more and more like Keith Richards, these days. There's Van Ronk, the bourgeoise looking Baez, and a glimpse of the ethereal John Jacob Niles. Why hasn't someone reissued recordings of this legend? This film is a great accompaniment to 'Chronicles. Vol 1'
0792838068|1.0|If you like pointless tear jerker sob stories without any real plot and a incredibly depressing ending you can see coming while you're getting your twizzlers and $3 tea cup of soda then you'll love this movie or just the extra push to keep you from commiting suicide cause your life can't be as pathertic as this. If you want a story with plot, character development, or even the possibility of feeling for the lead character spend your money elsewhere, stop reading and find another movie. <br /> <br />Many of the casino shots were in a former employee of mine, Sam's Town in Laughlin, NV. Since most of the moving scenery were locals a good cross section of the communites were in the film, so the showings were sold out for the first few days. Then is it was dead and gone. During the showing I attended no less than half of the audience was in the movie and if it wasn't for that fact every single one of us would have walked out. Half way through popcorn was flying at the screen to cries of 'someone just #@^%#ing shoot him already'. <br /> <br />I could not sympathize, empathize, feel remorse or even disgust with Cage's character, I was simply angry cause this movie made me feel like a unpaid social worker. Watching Cage pointlessly crawled from one bottle to the next without meeting a end to rhetorical whines of suicidal intent, oh yippie sign me up for another go. You think he could have at least wandered into traffic at some point and spared us. To a town full people who knew exactly how easy it was to A) drink yourself to death B) find yourself dead in one of the sleazier areas of Vegas or any city for that matter C) get drunk and wander into a bad sitiuation there by solving all your problems permanantly this movie was insulting. For all the money this coward wasted on booze he could have just gave it to one of the 'colorful characters' and said make sure I don't see it coming and spared a jerkwater town 2 hours of their already pathetic enough lives. <br /> <br />Eventhat my mother is in this movie will NEVER have me watching it again.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|This movie is a nice adaptation of a respected children Christmas story.  It's the story of a boy, perhaps a pre-teen, and his struggle to believe in Santa Claus.  On Christmas Eve he is whisked away on the Polar Express to the North Pole.  He, along with some new friends he encounters on the train, encounters a series of adventures on his way to the North Pole.  Once there he finally comes to terms with what he believes about Santa Claus.<br /><br />The movie includes all the scenes from the book and adds quite a few characters, events, and action sequences to the story.  Even with these additions to the story the theme is still the same as the original story in the book.  The story is somewhat darker than the traditional Christmas specials and movies marketed for children.  The story takes place late at night and because the children in the story are put in life threatening situations this movie may scare young children more than it entertains them.<br /><br />I may no longer be able to hear Santa's sleigh bells but this movie made me wish that I could.
B000BKDOCA|3.0|This album isn't really worth it, especially since Britney has much better remixes. All of the remixes on the Me Against The Music maxi single were far better than the MATM remix on here, especially the Gabriel & Dresden Mix and the Kanye West Mix. Some of the mixes are good though and perfect to play in clubs. But if you buy this album, seriously, buy it for the new track \\"And Then We Kiss\\". This song is pure genius and should be a single. It is dance/chill and would be a great song to release. Britney's vocals are excellent and if she is going in this direction, it really suits her. Download this song from iTunes, you won't be disappointed! It will be interesting to see what the original version of this song sounds like...
B000092ZYX|4.0|Having owned it already for months, I suddenly understood Hail to the Thief. We were playing it on the way back from a party at 2am in the morning...and instantly it came to life: songs about sitting down and standing up, sailing to the moon and scattered brains.

B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is a coming-of-age story that defines the character of a generation that is one of the most elusive in modern memory. Enid (Thora Birch) is stuck in a small town with peers and adults who are going nowhere. Only Norman, the aging would-be bus passenger, is reliable in her view--maybe because he is at least trying to leave town--though this is not something that is thrown at the audience but rather something to think about.     This is a thoughtful film with appealing characters, sharp wit and soft warmth. The composition including use of color in set and costume is lush and crisp; the editing and camera highly expressive. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to better understand the lives and issues of middle-class young people grappling with the search for identity at the end of the twentieth century.
B0000CDL93|2.0|In his landmark 1991 film about the assassination of President Kennedy -- \\"JFK\\" -- Oliver Stone has just about everybody east of the Rocky Mountains involved in one way or another in the elaborate \\"plot\\" to assassinate John Kennedy. This film is a veritable \\"Melting Pot of Plots\\".<br /><br />A logical question to ask would be: How could so many different people, agencies, and organizations possibly ALL be involved in such a massive assassination plot and never have anybody from any of these agencies leak any information? Such widespread theorizing is utter nonsense, IMO. I guess Mr. Stone just wanted to touch every possible base, and throw in the kitchen sink, to boot. :-)<br /><br />There's a point in the film which has Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) and his staff, while eating dinner in a restaurant, coming up with conspiracy theories seemingly out of thin air and off the tops of their heads. Mr. Garrison seems to be taking assassin Lee Harvey Oswald at his word when Oswald shouted \\"I'm just a patsy!\\" to the waiting press in the Dallas Police Department hallways. Of course, just exactly WHY this known liar (Oswald) -- who told one falsehood after another to both the police and the anxious press at the police station -- would suddenly be looked upon as a TRUTHFUL person by the conspiracy theorists, who believe he was telling the truth when he uttered his famous \\"Patsy\\" declaration after his arrest, is a mystery to me. Most curious indeed.<br /><br />\\"JFK\\", which premiered in U.S. movie theaters on December 20th, 1991, might very well make some people think twice about what really happened in Dallas on November 22, 1963. But when weighed against all the evidence in the case, you soon begin to realize that the film is designed ONLY to make you think like Oliver Stone WANTS you to think.<br /><br />And I would also ask those conspiracy theorists who take this movie to heart to consider the rationale and logic that would have been exhibited by any \\"plotters\\" who were attempting to \\"frame\\" their lone \\"Patsy\\" PRIOR to the assassination. Because placing your faith in the boobs who supposedly cooked up the kind of PRE-assassination \\"Let's-Frame-Oswald\\" plot that is proposed by Mr. Stone in this film is akin to drawing to an 'Inside Straight'! I'd sooner believe the sun will rise in the west tomorrow.<br /><br />In other words -- In order to accept the idea that Lee Harvey Oswald was the \\"Patsy\\" he said he was, and in order to buy into Oliver Stone's 3-Gunmen, 6-Shot \\"Triangulation of Crossfire\\" conspiracy theory that is the central \\"shooting plot\\" as depicted in this motion picture, anyone who accepts this film's proposed shooting scenario as \\"fact\\" MUST, therefore, also be of the opinion that these \\"conspirators\\"/\\"plotters\\" had no hesitation whatsoever to green-light and proceed full-tilt with a \\"Patsy\\" plan that would involve the POTENTIAL final results of having the one and only target (John F. Kennedy) being hit with UP TO SIX SEPARATE BULLETS fired from the guns of THREE different snipers (one of which was firing from the front, the exact OPPOSITE direction from where the ONE \\"Patsy\\" was supposedly firing in the Texas School Book Depository Building, which was located to the REAR of the President's car).<br /><br />Even in a 'perfect conspiracy world', how in the heck could these covert \\"plotters\\" possibly have thought (on November 21st, the day before such a nutty plan would be taking place) that it was a GOOD idea to utilize three different assassins, who would ALL be drilling JFK's body (potentially) with many bullets in just a short 6-to-8-second time period -- with several of these missiles coming from OBVIOUS non-Oswald (non-\\"Patsy\\") locations?<br /><br />Were these conspirators of the opinion (somehow) that JFK would be pronounced \\"dead\\" right there in the limousine, right there in Dealey Plaza, and would then be driven IMMEDIATELY to some \\"Conspiracy Morgue\\" someplace where all the wounds that have just been inflicted uponthe President would be \\"controlled\\" by the same evil henchmen who conceived of this plot?<br /><br />Did the people who dreamed up this impossible-to-pull-off \\"Frame-The-Lone-Patsy\\" plot really NOT consider the possibility of ALL six shots striking President Kennedy (or all six shots hitting SOMEBODY in Dealey Plaza)?<br /><br />Did these plotters just automatically assume that all of the \\"frontal-shot\\" evidence (that would have invariably blown the Patsy Plot to bits just minutes after the gunfire had ceased in Dealey Plaza) wouldn't be noticed by ANY Parkland personnel -- and that ZERO of these many bullets that would be potentially entering the body of John F. Kennedy (or any other victims who might be accidentally hit) would ALL simply \\"get lost\\" on their own or wouldn't be seen by ANY non-plotters?<br /><br />Or was it the conspirators' belief that all of these bullets would immediately be collected by some additional conspirators within the hospital? Or -- did the plotters just feel it wouldn't make any difference how many bullets had pelted JFK's body, and that any 'Non-Oswald' bullet wounds would simply be \\"taken care of\\" by other \\"after-the-shooting\\" conspirators who were in charge of the \\"Cover-Up\\" operation? Kind of a reckless plan and a very large risk to take -- don't you think?<br /><br />Plus: Did these clandestine assassins really NOT consider the potential eyewitness accounts of the literally hundreds of witnesses who were scattered throughout Dealey Plaza to watch the President pass by? (Many of them with cameras, who would be photographing the dastardly deed, potentially acquiring the filmed proof of conspiracy within their still photos and motion pictures!)<br /><br />Did the plotters just GET LUCKY when not one single witness saw ANY assassin other than the killer located in the \\"Oswald window\\" in the Depository? And did they just get lucky that the vast majority of earwitnesses heard only three shots (the EXACT number that Oswald could have fired in the allotted assassination timeframe)?<br /><br />And: Did the conspirators also just \\"luck out\\" when very, very few witnesses (less than 5% total) said that they heard shots coming FROM MORE THAN ONE DIRECTION? (And the vast majority of these witnesses heard shots from BEHIND the President's car, from the direction of the School Book Depository.)<br /><br />Didn't ANY of these things go through the heads of these assassination-planning operatives? If these potential \\"problems\\" with their screwball plan didn't enter their brains, these guys weren't earning their covert dollars, that's for sure.<br /><br />Shouldn't just a small bit of common sense and practicality have crept into the minds of these people (whoever they were supposed to be)? And shouldn't at least one of these plotters have spoken up and said on 11-21-63: \\"Gee, fellas, this plan seems a little bit loony to me. We're asking three different killers to all fire rifle bullets at JFK at virtually an identical point in time and yet also expect ALL of the trace evidence to, somehow, some way, immediately lead back to Oswald's window and only Oswald's rifle. Hmmm....maybe we ought to re-think the probability of this plan succeeding. Ya think?\\"<br /><br />But -- Per CTers, I guess nobody on the \\"JFK Assassination Plot\\" payroll made any such logical statement, and, therefore, the almost-certain-to-collapse plot was allowed to proceed, as planned.<br /><br />The \\"Common Sense\\" truth re. this mess that Oliver Stone purports in his movie is this --- From a PRE-assassination standpoint, a conspiracy plan as depicted in this film would have been just plain suicide for any team of conspirators, and is a plot that only a crazy person would think of going forward with. Which is the main reason why no such plan of this nature would have been implemented on 11-22-63; nor would such a foolish plot have even been considered in the first place, given the many obvious hazards and complications that such a \\"Patsy\\" operation would have presented.<br /><br />It's hilariously absurd from every given angle! Hard to believe any reasonable-thinking person can actually believe such \\"Oswald Was Merely A Patsy\\" nonsense.<br /><br />A portion of the \\"hilarity\\" in it stems from the idea that these behind-the-scenes plotters (who were supposedly manipulating Oswald like a puppet on a string) couldn't have cared less about the precise whereabouts of their one-and-only \\"Patsy\\" at the time JFK was being murdered.<br /><br />Because, per this movie, Lee Harvey is left free to roam the lower floors of the Depository building at his leisure (while supposedly waiting for a telephone call that never came), leaving him free to inadvertently establish himself a perfect alibi for his location and movements at exactly 12:30 PM on November 22 (should anyone happen to see him on the lower floors at 12:30).<br /><br />A great job by those \\"Real Killers\\" at keeping Oswald WHERE THEY NEEDED HIM, on the 6th Floor, huh? I guess it was just another instance (among gobs) where the \\"real killers\\" simply lucked out that afternoon, by not having one single person inside the Book Depository get even a brief glimpse of Lee Oswald on the lower TSBD floors at the time JFK is being killed outside the building. Will the grand luck of these conspirators ever run out? Per most CTers....apparently it never has.<br /><br />I think it's kind of interesting that Director Stone decided not to accept Robert Groden's complete version of the assassination. In his book (\\"The Killing Of A President\\"), Groden, who served as a technical adviser on the film \\"JFK\\", tells his readers of his conspiracy theory which involves a MINIMUM of 8 shots (and possibly even more). And, incredibly, Mr. Groden claims that NONE of these eight bullets likely came from the Oswald window in the TSBD! ~LOL break~ .... Please note that even Mr. Stone didn't \\"buy\\" that silliness.<br /><br />But, as far as Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" filmmaking is concerned, I think it's quite good. Very authentic-looking 1963-era \\"re-creations\\" were filmed of Dealey Plaza and the motorcade (with an appropriate amount of old-time \\"graininess\\" added to the new imagery), which have been intercut throughout the movie with actual news clips and amateur film footage. At times, it is difficult to discern between the re-creations and actual archival footage (although JFK assassination experts will have no trouble spying the differences). The editing of this picture is on a level way above anything else you're likely to see anywhere. And the John Williams music score is also superb.<br /><br />I have the 2-Disc Widescreen DVD edition of \\"JFK: Special Edition Director's Cut\\" (in the \\"Snapper\\" type case) that was released by Warner Home Video on February 6, 2001, which does not include the 90-minute \\"Beyond JFK: The Question Of Conspiracy\\" documentary that is available on the newer (2003) 2-Disc SE.<br /><br />This 2001 edition, though, does sport a beautiful Anamorphic (16x9-enhanced) DVD transfer (in the wide \\"scope\\" aspect ratio of 2.35:1). That fabulous music of John Williams shines brightly, too, via the disc's rich-sounding Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track. This DVD might own the record for most \\"Chapter Breaks\\", too (88 of 'em)!<br /><br />The bonus features on this (2001) 2-Disc DVD set aren't really that much to write home about, IMO. There's an Audio Commentary Track by Oliver Stone and some \\"Deleted/Extended Scenes\\" (which I did enjoy seeing). But the totality of the extras on this older DVD edition seem to be a tad on the weak side -- especially the feature on Disc 2 called \\"Multimedia Essays\\", which is pretty much dry as dust, IMHO. (Of course, I say this as a staunch \\"LNer\\" who believes in Lee Oswald's lone guilt in the JFK and J.D.

Something akin to .... \\"What you are watching is a fictional account of a true-life event. Handle with care; and with lots of salt.\\"<br /><br />I'd advise anyone interested in the JFK assassination to seek out (at any cost) the amazingly-good 1964 documentary \\"Four Days In November\\" (MGM/UA Home Video). It's a 123-minute journey back to November 1963 that is supported by the FACTS and EVIDENCE in the JFK case. It gives a detailed and thorough chronology of all four days surrounding President Kennedy's assassination, including Ruby killing Oswald and also a look at the hard facts supporting Lee Oswald's blatantly-obvious guilt in the murder of police officer J.D. Tippit.<br /><br />\\"Four Days In November\\" is the antithesis of Oliver Stone's fantasy film. I'd strongly recommend to everyone that they watch \\"Four Days\\" immediately after watching Stone's film. It's a night-and-day difference, of course. But at least \\"Four Days\\" is based on a little something that Mr. Stone's \\"JFK\\" doesn't get within a country mile of -- i.e.: The documented and verified facts of the events of November 22, 1963.<br /><br />So, I'd say -- Watch Oliver Stone's slickly-presented piece of motion-picture entertainment by all means.

B000000XB9|4.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival (otherwise known as CCR) are a fantastic classic rock band with a unique southern sound.  This greatest hits CD has more then enough of their collection for the average listener.  Many songs on this album receive heavy radio rotation and if you will probably recognize many songs if you can't place them already.  Songs like the pplitically carged \\"Fortunate Son\\" and the catchy \\"Hey Tonight\\" have been used in many shows and movies. <br /> <br />It's pretty interesting to see the range CCR exhibits on this disc.  \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" is a bluesy heart felt ballad and really showcases Fogerty's ability to maximize his limited vocal range.  On the other end of the spectrum, we have \\"Heard It Through the Grapevine\\".  An 11 min jam that really rocks with some fantastic solo guitar, it makes me wonder what these guys were capable of on.  They mastered the short radio \\"diddy\\" and prooved they can jam out...it's a shame they were only together for five years. <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A must have compilation for any fan of classic rock.  For all intensive purposes...it will suffice for all your CCR needs.
B0009SOFFY|5.0|Most of what you'll need in order to fully comprehend 1970's \\"Fun House\\" lies somewhere between Iggy's admission that he dropped acid every day during recording sessions, with an occasional psylicibin or Peruvian pink cocaine chaser, and the strident squawking, bleating, and screeching which punctuates \\"Down On The Street,\\" \\"Loose,\\" \\"1970,\\" \\"T.V. Eye\\" and the title track.  <br /> <br />Producer Don Gallucci's decision to record Iggy's vocals with a hand-held microphone amplified through a mini PA, along with Iggy's coercion of Steve MacKay to add saxophone stylings, coated the album with a sheen of raving lunacy, Ron Asheton cutting back on the fuzz but not the menace, Rock Action and  Dave Alexander forced to pick up the beat a wee bit in order to keep pace.  <br /> <br />There's a few curves here; \\"Dirt\\" is just what you'd expect the blues to sound like if filtered through the psyches of four guys cooped up indoors all winter in Michigan and although \\"L.A. Blues\\" has always caused me no small amount of heartburn, it ain't a bad way to clear a wedding reception.  <br /> <br />The bonus disc will be familiar to owners of \\"1970: The Complete Fun House Sessions\\"; demos, multiple takes, and spit polishing of various album tracks as well as single mixes of \\"Down On The Street\\" and \\"1970.\\"  <br /> <br />And in an entirely unintended moment of liner note hilarity, you get a buffoonish, completely misguided Jack White trying to distance himself from those who \\"watch a music TV station that's never heard of 'T.V. Eye'\\" and \\"shop at record stores where those who have only imitated Iggy's power are selling by the truckload.\\" Whatever you say, Jack, whatever you say...  <br /> <br />The recent glut of Stooges manna begs the question just what might still be laying around out there waiting to be uncovered. The sphincter tightens in anticipation.
0307276902|1.0|This book is a bad read...if just to follow a pathetic a**hole, <br />who hates himself and the world. He should have done us all a favor and OD. Most of it is self serving exaggerated BS, recollections no doubt distorted by his drugged out mind ...rather than condemning his habits he glorifies it to blow smoke up his own a** and inflate his ego...not only the descriptions of the amount of drugs abused, how \\"tough he thinks he is\\" ,  but especially the early descriptions of going to the dentist...You can certainly give local anesthetic and medications to recovering and/or \\"detox\\"ing patients ...So I would like to talk to the doc that provided that care?...the rest of the book continues on and on...complaining and struggling...I might muster some compassion for his struggle if he wasn't such a pompous braggart.

Now he should write a book on how to recover from that.  <br /> <br />Don't buy it. <br />Does not deserve the Oprah blessing, and all the $ it brings.
B0009SOFGI|5.0|In the liner notes to this souped-up reissue/remaster of the Stooges' wide-eyed, dribbling debut, Detroit native Alice Cooper (whose albums with the original Alice Cooper band are in dire need of a sonic upgrade) confesses that the Stooges were the only band he never wanted to follow largely in part to Iggy Pop's wild streak of unpredictability.  <br /> <br />Only 12 when \\"The Stooges\\" was released and 14 when the original band gave up the ghost, I never had the pleasure of seeing them live but I have seen Iggy solo several times, dating back to \\"The Idiot\\" tour, and \\"unpredictable\\" isn't an adjective which seems to fit much unless you consider Iggy staring down challenges from paying customers and eventually introducing them to \\"Little Iggy\\" abnormal. I've seen the guy's dick more than I've seen my own and believe me, I'm not proud of it.  <br /> <br />Given the musical climate at the time, however, The Stooges were something of an anomaly when that first album dropped its anchor back in 1969 because, as Brother Wayne Kramer has so bluntly pointed out, the Summer of Love didn't stop in Detroit. The race riots which reduced much of the city to so much cinder just two years previous apparently hadn't even registered as a blip on the radar of Ann Arbor's favorite sons, whose insular world, created just a short trek down I94 from the city proper, rotated on alternating axes of mindless fun, boredom, psychedelic escapism, ostracism, and pleasures of the flesh.  <br /> <br />Although the world has spun a few times in the ensuing 36 years, \\"The Stooges\\" still seems to defy explanation and/or context, a big-bang, primordial collision of monosyllabic angst and convulsing, tribal rhythm. There are those who feel all warm and fuzzy inside by anointing the Stooges harbingers of punk, but that seems woefully inadequate, perhaps even misguided. \\"No Fun,\\" \\"1969,\\" \\"Real Cool Time,\\" \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog,\\" and \\"Not Right\\" stake out a section of real estate entirely their own, oscillating between grey areas of alienation, tedium, and outright dementia, Iggy yammering, grunting, and howling over the Neanderthal lockstep laid down by drummer Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and the fuzzy, buzzing, angry hornet six-string dissertation of Ron Asheton.  <br /> <br />Plain and simple: these guys weren't fooling around.  <br /> <br />There's a bonus disc which gathers John Cale mixes of several songs which were deemed \\"too arty\\" by the band and later re-twiddled by Iggy and Elektra president Jac Holzman, and full versions of \\"Ann\\" and \\"No Fun,\\" the latter which fades out much too soon at the 6:50 mark with Asheton stomping his wah pedal flat.  <br />

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Sadly, like most of Madonna from the past decade, take away her DJ and she'd be flat out of the scene.  She took absolutely no risks with this production and it shows.  Practically any good electronic spin-master could produce this album, throw in any random diva for vocals, and voila, you have \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\".  Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic dance mix; Madonna is brilliant to keep herself fresh and in the scene by making music like this, however it's hard to call anything she's done in the past couple albums one of her classic \\"reinventions\\".  Regretfully you  walk away from this album remembering the wicked beats, but not the lyrics.  Madonna's core fans should like it, and anyone who likes to shake their ass will like it.  It's not a milestone, it's not very memorable, but it's well done.
B00005JKWJ|3.0|In any genre, sequels are a dicey business unless the director/writer intended the movie to be done in sequel format to begin with.  A good example of this is the LOTR trilogy.   <br /> <br />As mentioned before, the author didn't really keep this series open to that.  Although he mentioned that Blade would be out there, he seemingly had killed Whistler in the previous movie. <br />As mentioned in another review, this isn't what happened.  For this sequel to work, the vampires would have had to infiltrate his lair at the end of the other film.  That makes this sequel feel false. <br /> <br />Since others have spoken of the story, which wasn't too bad for a horror film, but it wasn't the most substantial, I would talk about the special effects.  There is a bit more computer-generated effects, which make some of the fighting moves seems a little cartoonish.  Further, in one fight, rather than seeing displays of the martial arts, we see a little bit of WWE professional wrestling.  Rather than give the fight a sense of power, it makes the fight a bit cheesy. <br /> <br />Going into the movie, I didn't have the highest of expectations, so it wasn't too bad.  If you are looking for a great film, this is not going to be it.  This is, however, not bad for a Friday night.
014017821X|5.0|This great collection of short stories by the late Angela Carter focusses on the theme of familiar fairy tales and legends that includes Red Riding Hood, Bluebeard, Puss in Boots, Beauty and the Beast, vampires and werewolves with a provocative element and mind-inflicting twists. The gist of these dark tales, written in fantastic prose venture on the chemistry between human and beast(s) and of their self-discovery of inner thought as well as their physical sexual conformations. This book can be read over and over as the language woven within it's plot reaches a point where there are many possiblities for the characters-the innocent virginal maiden and the beast can go from, and for the reader being left in a wild sense of wanting to know more.  So be prepared to be propelled through one heck of a rollercoaster as from the first few pages, even every sentence containing a unique word will immediately have an impact in this sexually implicit and bloody fest of a book.  I accidentally came across Angela Carter's works through \\"The Company of Wolves\\", as i have never heard of her, and will definitely be amongst my collection including S.K., James Herbert, Dean Koontz. Highly recommended for horror fans.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|\\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" is arguably one of the greatest interpretations of Charles Dickens' classic Ghost Story of Christmas. With equal parts humor and heart, it perfectly balances that stylish Muppet humor with big emotion and depth. It does so without ever condescending to the children that make up its core audience. Michael Caine gives a phenominal performance as the crotchety curmudgeon, Ebeneezer Scrooge, and the film boasts the best score of any of the Muppet films.  <br /> <br />The heart of any version of A Christmas Carol is the crucial scene involving Scrooge's long-lost love, Belle (or in some cases Emily). This scene is crucial to both character and story - this is when Scrooge's frozen heart begins to melt, giving credibility to his dramatic change at the end of the story. Even the Jim Henson company knew better to fiddle with this emotionally raw scene, allowing the fairly long sequence, told largely in song, to play without a single beat of humor.  <br /> <br />The song, entitled \\"When Love is Gone,\\" was inexplicably removed from the original theatrical release. In removing the sequence, Disney destroyed any beievability from the tale, leaving the film feeling unfinished and choppy. When the VHS was released in 1992, the song was put back into the film. This is not only the purist version of the film, but the one that feels most complete. <br /> <br />With this 50th anniversary Special Edition DVD, Disney has made one of the most disastrous creative decisions in recent memory. The DVD boasts both Widescreen and Fullscreen formats, but \\"When Love is Gone\\" is disappointingly present only in the Fullscreen format. Also, in using a single-sided duel layer disc, the film's visual presentation is sacrificed. This grainy, lackluster \\"Special Edition\\" presentation undermines the film's quality, leaving the buyer wanting more.  <br /> <br />The bonus features are almost more of a disappointment then the film's presentation on the disc. Containing only abrief (and terribly unfunny) gag reel, a documentary with no relevance to the movie, and a restrained commentary from director Brian Henson, one feels cheated for gaining no insight into the making of this classic.  <br /> <br />\\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" is a phenominal movie, and in that respect this is the must-have DVD of the season, however it deserved much better treatment than Disney was willing to supply it. This is a DVD to purchase, but only to have a long-lasting copy of one of the greatest Christmas stories ever told.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I Had never heard of this series except for on Amazon.  I purchased it based solely on the rave reviews.  If you are not sure, go for it!  You can trust all of these reviews -- This series is wonderful.  I stayed up 'till 2 a.m. watching it despite having to work at 8:00!
B000AARKW6|1.0|uy,yuy,yuy. i don't know what my sisters saw in this movie when it came out. i finally saw this wack a** movie from beginning to end. it was beyond boring. it was just like that movie, \\"Scarface\\", but worse. the whole time i was watching it, i was rolling my eyes waiting for something good to happen. the only good part about the film was THE END, when carlito was ready to get killed by the mob guys and when John Leguizamo popped back into the picture and he shot him. im sorry, any movie with Al Pacino in it, is BOR-ing to me.  no movie with that man in it has ever fascinated me. not Scarface, not the GodFather, not Serpico,  not even the Devil's Advocate.
B00007LTIB|5.0|In a volume published in Italy in 1979 for 'Longanesi & C', titled \\"The Big Of Pop Music\\", the famous musical reviewer Pier Tacchini wrote, in a long survey about the 'Yes', that the album 'Relayer' \\"was not up to the prevoius ones\\" and that this was mainly due to \\"the presence of Patrick Moraz at the keyboards\\" who had given rise \\"to some regrets for the fair-haired Rick Wakeman, a much more important figure both from a musical and scenic point of view\\". <br />Nevertheless, I remember that, more or less in the same period, I listened to the album for the first time, at some friends' home and I immediately got an excellent opinion as one of the best works of the famous English band. Today, more 20 years later, listening again, with great attention and concentration, to the CD appropriately expanded and remastered by 'Rhino Records', I must confirm, without any esitation, my first impression. I would also add that with the passing of time the value of this work by the 'Yes', dated 1974, has increased instead of decreasing. As a matter of fact, 'Relayer' can be placed, even more than 'The Yes Album', immediately after and very close to the tops reached by the British group with 'Fragile (1971-72), 'Close To The Edge' (1972) and 'Keystudio' (1997, 2001). <br />The contribution of Patrick Moraz, there can't be any doubts, is here excellent and distinguished, even because of the musical trend of the whole album pervaded with a jazz-like taste. Both Jon Anderson and Chris Squire as well as Steve Howe express themselves at a very high level as usual, while Alan White, unlike other performances which, in my opinion, were not completely convincing for the rhythmic solutions as in 'Going For The One' (1977) and 'Tormato' (1978), manages, here, to combine strenght, vigour and power with smoothness, agility and creativity. <br />Wonderful the pieces 'The Gates Of Delirium' (21:55) and 'Sound Chaser' (9:25), slightly inferior the third and last track 'To Be Over' (9:08). <br />An impartial and objective evaluation would call for 4,50 stars, but, as the album has always been underestimated because of Wakeman's absence (whose talent and qualities are not under discussion), my proposal of evaluation rises to 5 stars. <br />[English version revised by Guerrino Maccaferri]
B000085RTZ|3.0|What does damage to this otherwise very competent, talented and strong band is drummer Casey Grillo's annoying habit of filling every single space in the songs with that awkward double kick drums. The whole time, all the songs!! It seems it's the only technique he masters! In EPICA this happens once again. We have Roy Khan amazing and meloid vocals buried under a ton of those damned double kick drums (maybe it's Thomas Youngblood who orders him to play this away.)
B000B8QF14|1.0|Green Days \\"American Idiot\\"  album (released 2004) is less of an artistic statement by a long mile than any of their previous records which seemed to be more about music than leaping around screaming \\"England!!\\" (meaning?) on stage and featuring a thousand explosions and ridiculously, an overdoing of their commercially successful album \\"American Idiot\\" songs, which we've heard a thousand times of Music Television and radio, which has been marketed directly to the safe and mainstream unadventurous audiences. <br /> <br />The Green Day of, hey 2002? They released a B Sides compilation called \\"Shenanigans\\", no one took any notice? Yet why in 2004 and 2005 everyone thinks \\"American Idiot\\" is the dogs bollix and they are suddenly so great, when for years before, no one gave a crap? And neither did Green Day. <br /> <br />Marketing - is your answer, this is'nt music! The fact that quotes such as \\"reclaims punks ambition\\" are laughable and so wide of the mark its a joke. Critics know absolutely nothing about music, well most of them oviously. <br /> <br />Green Day were'nt neccesarilly punk in the first place anyway, if you want punk go listen to \\"Sex Pistols\\" or \\"The Offspring\\", Green Day wrote melodic tunes \\"When I come around\\" \\"Warning\\" \\"She\\" \\"Redundant\\". <br /> <br />To some who don't even really enjoy music, these guys at the moment are the best thing since sliced bread, but it looks like they've gained a new audience that does'nt really count for anything.

B0000BWTK3|5.0|Leif Ove Andsnes is wisely pacing his career with recordings not only of varied repertoire and dividing his time with solo collections, chamber ensembles, and collaborations (the magnificent Schubert 'Winterreise' with Ian Bostridge recording, for a fine example!), but he seems to be marking his maturity with repeated recordings of works he has championed.  This stunning recoding of the Grieg Piano Concerto benefits enormously from the collaboration with Mariss Jansons and the Berlin Philharmonic.<br /><br />Recorded live, the sound of this CD is lush and velvety smooth, quite in keeping with Andsnes richly flowing Grieg. This is the quality of commitment to the Grieg that he is currently stunning audiences at the Los Angeles Philharmonic performances. The added pleasure of the Schumann Piano Concerto rounds out a performance that deservedly won the Gramophone Award for Best Concerto category.  This is as fine as it gets and should be part of every collection despite the possible duplications of these two works. Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 05
B0009WFFS6|1.0|Yikes. I just finished watching this DVD and what a bringdown! As a lifelong fan of the legendary Cream, I had total mixed emotions when I heard about this reunion. Of course, I totally wanted to see this happen since I was too young to see the Cream in their prime. Yet I was truly hoping it wasn't gonna be a lukewarm run through of past glories.  <br /> <br />But I never imagined it would ever be this lame! <br />Although Eric Clapton looks more enthusiastic than I've ever seen him (he actually prowls the stage, rockin' and bobbin'), his unimaginative playing and thin tone betray his guitar hero status. Anybody can have an off night but c'mon Clapton, you had four gigs to get some fire in the belly! This is the band that vaulted you to International Rock God! PLAY THE GUITAR LIKE YOU MEAN IT! And make sure it's on a guitar where you've truly shined the best - on a Gibson! Play a Firebird! Play a  Les Paul! Play a SG! PLAY A GIBSON GUITAR! What is that you say? \\"And not a single Marshall amp to be found\\". This is the Cream, right? <br />Where is the thick, singing sustain and wonderful \\"woman\\" tone that defined Clapton of this era? It turned into a thin, nasal single-coil rasp that pulls up weak. There is no power in this trio.  <br />   <br />Actually, I think Clapton not showing up with some semblance of the classic Cream gear woefully planted this reunion in the grave from the get go. It's like Clapton's not even trying to capture the vibe of what made this band a sonic revelation back in the day. Heck, he's not even trying to make it sound like a half-way decent bar band covering Cream songs. There's not even a wah-wah pedal deployed for \\"White Room\\" for heavens sake! <br /> <br />\\"We're Going Wrong\\" is the best performance here but the rest of the songs are all slow paced and dull. Ginger Baker dumbs down the previously complex rhythms, Jack Bruce sings and plays well but seems disinterested and the audience, although totally adoring, is lousy with yawns and low attention spans.  <br />And who can blame them!  <br /> <br />Goodbye Cream!  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
1593072937|4.0|Frank Miller doesn't write your grandpa's Archie comix . . . <br /> <br />\\"The Hard Goodbye\\" tells the tale of Marv and his vengeance, and is so hard-boiled even L.A. noir master James Ellroy would stand up and take notice.   <br /> <br />The word \\"anti-hero\\" gets tossed around a lot these days (including by me), and current fiction has quite a few strong candidates for the title.  Barry Eisler's John Rain and Lee Child's Jack Reacher fit the bill nicely.  Frank Miller's Marv takes the label anti-hero and crushes it to death with his bare hands, possibly after chopping its limbs off first and feeding it to ravenous wolves. <br /> <br />The story of \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" is simplicity itself.  Sin City is the crime-ridden burg of our tale, full of murderers, thieves, and prostitutes (and those are just the elected officials). Marv, a murderous brute so ugly that he can't even hire one of Sin City's innumerable hookers, spends a night of passion with the \\"perfect woman,\\" Goldie.  But then Marv wakes up to find Goldie murdered next to him and corrupt cops kicking down his door. <br /> <br />Even a \\"confused\\" guy like Marv can figure out that he's been set up.  Marv has a pretty simple code of justice - don't mess with me or with the woman I love.  Somebody violated that code.  Somebody's going to die.  Hard.  Bad.  Broken.   <br /> <br />Along the way, Marv's trail of vengeance leads him to many dastardly criminals and leaves behind almost as many bodies.  Told in stark black-and-white, \\"The Hard Goodbye\\" isn't for the squeamish, but it has a sentimental side.   <br /> <br />I confess that I prefer color to the black-and-white, if only because I've seen what Miller can do in his voluptuous tale of the Spartans at Thermopylae in \\"300.\\"  I have to find some way to critique Miller's work, so there you go.  A must for fan of pulp fiction, hard-boiled crime tales, or just damn good stories.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|John Mayer just keeps getting better and better! At least that's what this pop-acoustic-jazz-blues-loving music fan thinks. His first two albums are always blasted on my computer speakers/iPod. I've been listening to this album ever since I got this as a birthday present (11/28!)The songs are soothing at times, and upbeat which really gets you in the mood. The album is also nice to listen to, especially after a long day from school, work, or your just chilling at home.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that they should have included a DVD with this package. Just like \\"Any Given Thursday\\" it would be awesome to see all the live performances of John Mayer Trio, or maybe at least all the performances of the songs in this album. Also a documentary on how John, Pino, and Steve collaborated with each other, touring around the country, etc. etc. Oh well, i'll continue to cross my fingers. Until then, I will patiently await what John Mayer will come up with in his next album.
B00005A46T|5.0|This is one the best metal cds ever. It never leaves my cd folder, and I always enjoy listening too it. Every song is brutual but easy to sing along too. You can relate to the lyrics, believe it or not. Its too bad they are over exposed now and on every metal magazine you can name. This was before they were made in media puppets. Then again, every artist you see on VH1 or MTV today are way over exposed.
B000B8QF14|5.0|I'm a late-comer to the cult of Green Day, but having seen them perform live, I'm a full-fledged convert.  I haven't stopped playing \\"American Idiot\\" since it was released and their live show was phenomenal.  They're one of the few bands whose songs sound better live -- between the crowd's enthusiasm and the band's mind-blowing talent it made one of the best concert's I've ever seen.  The DVD does them justice (play it really really LOUD), but I would have loved more footage.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is an epic of a film. It is one of a kind  and what I loved about this film is the mixed reviews I heard from people. You see most people have shorter attention span than others and cannot tolerate violence. I do not think this film was of very violent nature. However, I do feel it's immensely entertaining and wholesome in it's movie making experience.<br /><br />I never liked revenge films and it's a genre that became my favourite after I watched the epic film called \\"Oldboy\\" around August this year. Oldboy was fascinating with that slap of phenomenal flabbergasting suspense it has. Kill Bill is better directed than Oldboy but its just one step down from being the best revenge film I have ever seen. You see Oldboy wins over this film. However I take nothing away from this flawless flick.Most people think that fans like Kill Bill because of the violence it contains. I beg to differ because the story line and how it unfolds on screen is what I loved the most about this film.<br /><br />Uma Thurman plays a role of a lifetime. I still can't believe she can move like that. Around 90% of the action on this film would make Crouching Tiger look like a fairytale of sorts. I do not care if this film is exaggerated and stretched beyond what most imaginations can be led to believe. I usually lie on my couch while watching films but Kill Bill ensured that I sit up and take notice.<br /><br />It is quite difficult to talk about what I appreciate most about Kill Bill but it made me a Tarantino fan. I never liked any of his earlier films as much as I liked this one. I cannot wait to watch Kill Bill 2 and I am glad I own the dvd. I never bothered to watch it. I love how fresh Kill Bill was because the studios,the atmosphere around the film , the swords, the blood, the black and white scenes, the wagons,the airplane with a orange feel outside,etc. were all that made Kill Bill into a film that I would remember all my life.<br /><br />My Rating - 10/10<br /><br />I suggest all fans watch Oldboy too.<br /><br />Respect,<br /><br />HSAI suggest all fans watch Oldboy too. <br /> <br />Respect, <br />HSA
B000069HZP|5.0|I can't help but harken back to Michael Douglas's terriffic portrayal as a stock market financier in Wall Street. His character in The Game is strikingly similar to Gordon Gecco, except the dissimilarity of the Game's Orton is that instead of truly enjoying the merits of massive money monkey malarchy, he seems only interested in attaining more of it at the cost of no personal life whatsoever.  <br />Douglas is again, his usual thriller great self. We see him at the true zenith of perfection in his attempts to discover the secrets of the corporation that set forth this intriguing but upsetting game which seems to be much more than the simplicity originally implied.  <br />Oh sure, we expect something special in his brother's gift, but we certainly dont expect to be so far on the edge of our seat that we are getting cramps in our butts just trying to stay there.  <br />What I truly loved about this movie is my own lack of ability to come to a true answer as to what was really going on. So often, it is within my and other's nature to try and be smart and figure out the intended ending, only to be found right and then slightly disappointed that the writer and director didn't go past our expectations. Not so with The Game. Game takes you so deep into this man's downward spiral while \\"playing\\" this deceptive game, figuring out it's true intent becomes second nature. By the end, your nerves are so shatterred from the journey, you feel like you've been right there with Van Orton experiencing every nuance of the events in reality yourself. Plus, the finale is truly magnificent, which I cannot spoil here. This movie is a true must for anyone who is a fan of movies that not only make you think, but defy the typical Hollywood thriller model.
B0001MDP36|5.0|I readily concede the star power of this moving film.  Hard to go wrong with headliners like Nicole Kidman, Rene Zellweger, and Jude Law; even harder to miss the mark with COLD MOUNTAIN's supporting cast--a cast including Donald Sutherland, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Brendan Gleeson, Ray Winstone, and James Gammon, just to name a few.<br /><br />But I'm going to digress from the thespians, for two reasons:  1) I'm ornery; and 2) the real sucess for this movie, in my humble little opinion, resides in the capable hands of its filmmakers.<br /><br />Based on Charles Frazier's bestselling, award-winning novel, COLD MOUNTAIN is a bittersweet love story set in the majestic mountains of North Carolina during the tumultuous Civil War.  Two individuals make an instant soulful connection, just before their brief romance is violated by the ugliness of war.  While the man fights--first to survive, then to seek out his beloved--the woman must fend for herself, often under miserable, even brutal conditions.  Their odyssey forms the backbone of this unforgettable film.<br /><br />Yet its compelling story is not the highlight of this movie; COLD MOUNTAIN is exceptional because of its remarkable craftmanship, beginning with director Anthony Minghella.  Aided by the haunting visuals of cinematographer John Seale, Minghella lets pictures tell the story.  He utilizes countless devices to augment the sweeping images portrayed:  disturbing slow motion shots, unique camera angles, dramatic audio voice-overs, a liquid image of a figure metaphysically projected in a water well.  Such visuals combine and mesh to present the entire spectrum of the story, from its elegance and beauty, to its brutality and sorrow.  Enhanced by the talent of its actors, Minghella's film is an artistic feast of wonder and delight.<br /><br />Finally, COLD MOUNTAIN delivers the sights and sounds of 19th Century North Carolina via Gabriel Yared's dynamic musical score--by a profound sound track of unforgettable songs, including Jack White's \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" and Alison Krauss' haunting \\"You Will Be My Ain True Love.\\"  COLD MOUNTAIN is the entire package of epic movie making on a grand scale, a timeless treat for cinematic enthusiasts.<br /><br />--D. Mikels, Author, WALK-ONack of unforgettable songs, including Jack White's \\"Wayfaring Stranger\\" and Alison Krauss' haunting \\"You Will Be My Ain True Love.\\"  COLD MOUNTAIN is the entire package of epic movie making on a grand scale, a timeless treat for cinematic enthusiasts. <br />--D.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Sure Donnie Darko is a mind bending movie of so many mixed messages, even with multiple viewings you still may not \\"get\\" it all, but thats what makes the film so masterful. Each time I watch it, I find even more brilliance in it, more to ponder, more to discuss. So, with that said, how do I review the screen's most complex and disturbing look inside the mind of a borderline schizo teen who is at the crux of possible worldwide destruction described by the poster bunny for rabbit population control while Donnie is on a discovery path to himself? <br /> <br />Well, I could start with the fact that so much more lies within the coal plated exterior edges of this true horriffic masterpiece than first meets the eye. <br /> <br />I could focus on the few comedic elements that lie on the outskirts of some of the most dramatically striking scenes ever devised in any movie, let alone one of an outsider teen on the brink of seeming madness, but really more sane and smart than most.  <br /> <br />I could comment on the almost cardboard cutout representations of 80's suburbanite caramel coated goodness that Donnie is so far removed from and how that difference brilliantly skywrites the message of \\"just because I am different doesn't mean I am crazy, you're all the nutso ones!\\" <br /> <br />Or I simply could leave you to your own conclusions. I think I will just do the latter....
B000BP86OG|5.0|I sure wish America would hurry up and warm up to these guys - they are incredible. On first listen, I thought this album was okay. By fifth listen, I was amazed. The songwriting is consistently great throughout the entire CD. Justin's vox are higher than ever. Definitely more produced than PTL which is a lateral move, neither worse nor better than PTL, just different. Just watched the clip of them on Letterman doing \\"Is It Just Me\\" (it's on CBS's website) - I was curious to see how they would pull off the songs live without the overdubs, and it worked. Sounded like if it were from PTL - raw and rock hard. The harmonized guitar solo between Justin and Dan was tough as nails. Can't wait for them to tour live. Highly recommended.
B000BOH8XW|3.0|I am a person who really appreciates good lyrics in music, which is why I have been a fan of Shakira for years. She has a poetic touch in her song writing skills.  <br /> <br />However, I am now convinced that her music in English just doesn't do it for me. I don't like the style change, the lyrics don't always mesh well with the music, and it seems very watered down from her Spanish albums. I'm sure this is purposefully done to grab the attention of a larger international public, but I personally find it a bit drab. <br /> <br />People who are ultra fans don't like to hear these types of criticisms, but you can't win them all. I know both albums are supposed to be different, I wasn't expecting a Fijacion Oral #2. However, I am not as impressed as everyone here.  <br /> <br />This is my opinion, and everyone's opinion on here is valid as long as they are qualifying the music. I notice how people attack others if they do not find the opinion at par to those who love the album, which I find childish. It has received mixed reviews, therefore, some find it great while others do not.  <br /> <br />I think it is a medium ranged pop album. Not excellent and ultra-unique, but not mediocre either. Some of the songs are enjoyable and interesting, while others are a bit generic and forgettable (lyrics included).   <br /> <br />Buy if you enjoy this type of music.
B0000062FN|4.0|back in the 70's I used to listen to this album a lot.  there's a lot of good stuff here, but I noticed one thing that no-one else has pointed out: the song Everybody's Everything is a direct ripoff note for note of an earlier soul song called Karate by a group called The Emporers (if you don't believe me, check it out for yourself).  I can't believe the band didn't get sued for copyright infringement! And the song \\"NO-one To Depend On\\" is a straight up copy of a Willie Bobo song. Nevertheless, this is a great cd and if I had to have one Santana album this would be the one.
B00005JNX0|5.0|From the makers of Shrek and Shrek 2 comes a rolling-over hilarious comedy.  Four animal friends from the Central Park Zoo find themselves onboard a ship to Madagascar thanks, in part, to the help of some pengiuns.  Once there, they face the challenges of the unknown wild.  It is a riot of fun and laughter from the opening scenes to ending credits for all ages and hardly a dull moment.  Although the tribal lemurs could have toned down a bit, the film takes advantage of creative voices from Chris Rock, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith to give life to the characters.<br /><br />Additionally, the disc set comes with a Christmas special starring the penguins from this movie.  This is a fun little short as well and worth the purchase.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Mr. Reznor has done it again!  Another album, another sound.  Albeit with this album, the sound is in large part a complex composite of all his prior work.  I really like it!  It has most of the elements that made Pretty Hate Machine superb; but takes on a 2005 tone by blending in a much more acoustic sound. It is somehow familiar, but new.    <br /> <br />All NIN albums have the same effect on me.  They just get better and better every time I listen.  With Teeth is no exception.  Once you get past the \\"shock\\" part of the sound, you start hearing the complex rhythms and feeling the unparalleled energy. What a fun album to just throw into the player and let it take you for a ride!!
B000B8QEZG|1.0|First of all, I'm not sure how this crap can be called music.  Its all synthesizers and ripped off beats. I never understood the appeal of this overrated and untalented artist (I use that term loosely) but she has some good music over the years. The only Madonna albums I have are Ray of Light, and Bedtime Stories. Basically, the only way I can stomach a Madonna album is when she doesn't write or produce it herself which essentially is fraud when you think about it. Everyone has different tastes in music and I guess soulless, banal dance music obviously speaks to some people. I don't hate Madonna because she's just a celebrity to me and I think its pathetic to go around hating celebrities. One thing that puzzles me is that so many Madonna fans love bashing Mariah, why? If you go to Mariah's review board there's tons of Madonna psychos bashing Mariah and giving her latest album terrible reviews even though they haven't heard it. I guess Madonna fans don't want to face that she no longer has the most number one songs or has sold the most records in the 90's. It just goes to show you how low-class, insecure, and delusional Madonna fans are. But I guess you are who you idolize.  Don't waste your money on this crap! There's so many singers out there who have actual vocal ability, and real things to say on their albums!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Slipknot is my favorite band on the disgraceful planet earth. I will tell anyone that. I love the first and second albums, but my god! What have they done? Gotten even better, that is what they have done my friends. No matter what these retards on this website tell you, there is no denying this powerful band anymore! Slipknot have set out to rule the world on their own terms and they are on their way as I speak. This cd has ultimate brutality, horrible sadness, and an attitude that is unmistakeable. I can put this in and push play and be completely satisfied for over an hour. You could to if you would stop listening to dumb people and go with your hearts. I even read some idiots review that called them metalcore; sorry dude, no freaking way! Slipknot in my mind cannot be put in a category and that is why they are the best band in the world. They give you their hearts and souls in everything they do and people still put them down, I don't get it. Anyways, don't listen to me if you don't want to cuz I may not be right either, but at least I buy what I like and don't listen to other people. Buy this album if you want outstanding, brutal, passionate, heavy freaking metal that will peel your pathetic face off. I'm out; LONG LIVE METAL!!!!!!!!!!
B00001NFCY|4.0|This, Being Creed's 2nd album, was more than a respectable follow-up to their stellar 1997 debut ''My own prison''. Though this album lacks a bit of the freshness of that album, This album is a joy to listen to. The songs still have that dark, atmospheric sound that Creed is known for. The best songs are ''With arms wide open'' [You've most likely heard this song and saw the video, This single is the best song on the album, Check out the bonus remix at the end of this album also], ''Higher'', ''Are you ready'', ''Never die'', and ''Beautiful''. Creed truly was a band that had great music that had strong social themes as well as spiritual themes. I strongly advise anyone who hasn't heard Creed before to ignore the negative things you will hear about Creed and check out their albums. Unfortunately, After their next album, ''Weathered'', This wonderful band broke up. The more i hear 1 of Creed's cds, The more i pray for a Creed reunion. Hope this review helped ya. Be blessed now.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I've had a mild interest in Bluegrass ever since the \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" movie with George Clooney featuring the song \\"(I Am) A Man of Constant Sorrow.\\" Good movie, great music. At the time I didn't even know who Alison Krauss was and wouldn't until seeing her perform on David Letterman. Oh, man, what a voice! I'm no Bluegrass officianado. I just know what I like. And this is it. <br /> <br />This double disk set has the best sound quality of any live album I've yet heard, better than most in-studio albums. The recording is clear and crisp, almost too crisp since some of the whistles from the audience seemed piercing (and I had to turn down the volume), but all the better to capture the ephemeral high notes and vocal inflections Alison hits with breezy ease. Did I mention she has a great voice? Oh, baby! If you have a quality sound system, you will soon appreciate the far above average recording quality and live venue -- an all too rare mix. Makes you wonder why all albums don't sound this good. Then again, most lead singers and backup bands aren't half as talented as A.K. + Union Station. <br /> <br />There is only one word to truly describe this 2 disk set - AMAZING! Great songs, great vocals, great instrumentals, great value (25 songs in all). 5 STARS doesn't do this album justice. Alison Krauss, where have you been all my life? And will you marry me?  <br />
078681859X|5.0|I thought this was such a good book. I loved the footnotes at the bottom being the opinions of the spirit/creature (I read this book over a year ago, sorry)! It was a fun book with some mystery and intrigue. At times I had no idea how they would get out of situations, but it was creatively done, with plenty of funny tidbits.
B000AGTPUA|2.0|WOW, I went to the movies with my husband & My Baby girl. We watched the 3D Version in the city. Picture was beautiful, but the plot to this movie needs major work because it was really boring. My daugther was the only one half delighted, but has not mention the movie to me again. I definity won't be making this part of my collection, although I Love Tom Hanks. Well I might consider buying it for a dollar, No more then five, just for the picture. Full price is not worth it.
0671027344|5.0|Whenever someone tells me a book/movie/cd will change my life, I always end up greatly disappointed because afterward, I am no different than beforehand. This book didn't change my life, but it gave me a lot to think about. The obscurity of never knowing who he is talking to kept me in. The ending made me cry. It is a very easy book to read, but you can sit and think about it for hours. It's a really good book and I definitely recommend it. Also, a book with the Smiths in it constantly? Come on, it gets no better!
0140186409|4.0|I read this book when I was a Junior in High School. I didn't liek the book at first, and it was hard to get into, but once I really started reading it, I found myself wanting to read more and more. This book has some great underlying lessons. The family in this book had a really hard time with life during the depression. But even during the hardest of times, they stuck together as a family and worked out what they were going through. I recommend this book to anyone.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I was going to get this for my dad for X-mass, but sorry Sony not going to get. You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus. Guess I will get the next CD on his list.
B00004STUL|4.0|For his first film, Director Michael Bay took production to Miami like a bull in a china shop.  The perfectionist film maker supposedly ruffled many feathers with his demands and `do-it-my-way' approach.   <br /> <br />Despite the rumors, and they are just rumors which are usually based on disproportionate facts, Bay had Jerry Bruckheimer in his corner and was able to get it done.  Even back in 1994 when Bruckheimer was merely a Producer Czar, and not quite the Producer Deity that he is today he was able to get sections of busy streets closed off and complete shooting schedules approved on location in Miami.  Bay went on to help Bruckheimer became even more influential with a string of blockbuster action hits; The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br />To emphasize the point, Bay really does know what he's doing when it comes to making movies.  Bad Boys being his first film, he certainly wanted to do it right.  The SE DVD explains much of this as he worked with Lawrence and Smith to get the most out of the characters as well as the sets.  He actually paid for an entire scene (several thousand dollars) on the basis that he believed the movie needed it and would get it back if the movie made enough at the box office.  It did, and he got his money back and then some. <br /> <br />Now to focus on the movie itself.  It's a buddy cop movie at the core, but it's different in that both characters are black.  The script was originally written for Dana Carvey and John Lovitz, which would have made it a much different movie.  As with many scripts, parts are usually written with the assumption that a white person would play the role but could easily be played by a black person.  Samuel L. Jackson has won many roles by pointing out this oversight.  It's a refreshing change compared to many movies because not only are they black but Lawrence and Smith do a superb job of characterizing two very different people.  Lawrence play Det. Marcus Burnett, a working man's cop.  He's married with kids and a house.  Will Smith, in his first action flick, plays Det. Mike Lowrey, a somewhat self centered ladies man who was left a large trust fund by his parents (we're never told what happened to them).  He drives a Porsche, wears silk shirts and lives in an art deco condo on Bayside.  The two play off each other with skill in being very black sometimes but at the same time, very funny.  They have deep chemistry that comes off as a partnership/friendship that goes back a long way.   <br /> <br />The plot centers around the two Vice Detectives as they try to find out who stole their largest bust of heroine.  The fear of political repercussion of someone taking the fall for the screw up gives them a time limit.  As Marcus and Mike hit the street one of the thieves squanders some of the heroine and gets himself killed by the mastermind of the operation, Fouchet (Tchky Karyo).  In the process, an expensive call girl and her friend, Julie (Ta Leoni) are caught in the crossfire.  Only Julie survives.  What happens next is a case of mistaken Identity that cannot explained in a short sentence or two.  Suffice to say, it provides the movie with many moments of comic relief. <br /> <br />As things unfold the action scenes become more energenic.  The cinematography and use of slow motion are used to their full potential.  This is where Michael Bay shines, in the look of the film.  The lobby shoot out/foot chase provides the best action sequence of the movie with many shots of Smith that glimpse into his future stardom.  The ending action scenes are a great climax. <br />This movie is a stellar introduction piece of work.  It has some flaws but none that are glaring.  The infusion of life into the buddy cop movie was badly needed and this movie does it in large doses.
B000AGTPUA|5.0|Chrismas, adventure, Tom Hanks...... <br />I didn't read the book, but no adoubt, this movie is the greatest chrismas movie for ever.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|This is by far the best CD System Of A Down has released since Toxicity.  They have kept the intensity/humour contrast that is so characteristic of them : among the emtionnally intense songs of this album, you will find Soldier Side, Hypnotize, Dreaming, Holy Mountain, Lonely Day and most definitely Tentative, which is undoubtedly my favourite song off the album, and the closest song to Chop Suey! which is my personaly all-time favourite SOAD song ever.  And then there are the funny songs : U-Fig, She's Like Heroin and I would even add Kill Rock 'n Roll. <br /> <br />All in all, great album, I was mezmerized by System's capacity to surpass themselves because I honestly wasn't expecting something THIS great, since Steal This Album! was decent but not excellent, and although Mezmerize was much better than Steal This Album!, it wasn't really anywhere close to Toxicity.  But Hypnotize makes you forget those little \\"downfalls\\" and gives hope of an SOAD forceful return. <br /> <br />Their lyrics remain very political in many songs, and when they are not, they are plain ridiculous.  I love listening to a new SOAD song for the first time cause I never know if it's gonna give me chills or make me laugh.  And I definitely chuckled when I heard U-Fig on this one, just as I had laughed my head off when I had first heard Pictures off of Steal This Album!, which Serj going \\"Pa-pa-pa-PA!\\" in a really high-pitched tone. <br /> <br />This band has such incredible potential it amazes me.  I'm looking forward to new material already, but for the moment, I'm probably gonna keep listening to Hypnotize daily like I have been doing since I bought it on Nov. 22nd.  If you are a System Of A Down fan, or if you're only into them a little (which probably means that you liked Toxicity a lot but the other CD's a little less) and are hesitating to buy this CD, I hearten you to buy it, you will not be disappointed!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I took my wife to this movie.  Afterwards she told me she had been dreading having to see one of my Sci-Fi movies, but that she loved it!  This really is one of the best movies of 2005, and almost every critic in the country loved it (including my wife).  Serenity received an amazingly high 87% Cream of the Crop rating at Rotten Tomatoes, a rating very few movies this year (2005) can top.  It has a great plot, really solid acting from a fine ensemble cast, and the special effects were well done.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.

B0002ZYE1Y|1.0|If you like pop music then you will like where they went with this album. I hate to say I hate the album it makes me sad. <br /> <br />Their levels all wrong. Turning the keyboards down was horrible. Then turning the guitars up and simplifying them. While they were at it they also made the drums dissapear. I dislike Marcos vocals. I hope they go back the direction they came from before this album. <br /> <br />It seems like some big producer walked up to the band made them mainstream their amazing music. I hope this isnt the end of the old nightwish.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|This is a TERRIBLE piece of american culture, and truly illustrates everything that is wrong with western culture. THere is not one redeeming quality in the entire series. The actresses who play the supposedly fabulous characters are anything but. No man in his right mind would be attracted to these ugly skanky women. also I found the whole series to be quite misogynistic since all the women characters are so wholly negative. Plus it seems that the writer is perhaps making the statement that professional women who focus on their careers are ugly, bitter sex crazed whores, which is what these characters are. What I don't get is their sex or reliationships could be special after the ten thousandth sexual encounter. This does not bode well for our country.
B0009I7O7U|3.0|This cd has real good music, and I would recommend it, but if you plan on ripping it to iTunes or any other media server, think again - you can't!

B000244FDW|1.0|I am spoiled by the A&E version. It has Jane Austin's spirit. A true enjoy. As a matter of fact, that is my all time favorite. This BBC one is unspeakable. Just read the reviews that has one star, I agree with all of them. I even think that 20 minutes is a waste of my time. If you never read the book, you would never think this movie is intended to be a romance, never a comedy.

0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is about a brutally honest man who subconscioulsy commits a meaningless murder and comes to the realization of what his own life is truly worth. Although this novel is worth reading, it does contain some flaws. Due to the complex structure of the narrative, The Stranger is a book for the strong minded. The lack of dialogue makes it bland at times; furthermore, Camus' attention to detail can befog the reader. However, the positive aspects outweight the negatives. The philosophy behind the book makes it thought provoking and characters in The Stranger relate to every reader. Camus' profound use of imagery appeals to the senses. This novel is recommended for aspiring philosophers and intellectuals alike. Don't be discouraged, anyone is capable of understanding The Stranger by Albert Camus.
B00006AW2G|5.0|There are a few songs that are so great, I remember exactly where I was when I first heard them.  \\"Good Vibrations.\\"  \\"Well-Respected Man.\\"  \\"I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You).\\" \\"Aja.\\" \\"1999.\\"<br /><br />One of those songs is the lead track on this album. I was in bed. My clock-radio had just gone off and I was listening to a good station.  The timing was perfect; I was a groggy high school freshman who'd struggled all the previous night with geometry, so I didn't want to get up right away. The DJ said, \\"we've got the new Rolling Stones,\\" and proceeded to play \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  It gave me chills.  I'd heard a lot of great Stones songs up to that point, like \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" \\"Paint It, Black,\\" and \\"Let's Spend the Night Together,\\" but this was something else, a cry from the heart of all the paranoia of 1969, but even more timeless, the sound of the apocalyptic doom closing in. It was perfect that Jagger shared the lead vocals with Merry Clayton.  The climax of the song is when she loses control over her voice singing the word \\"murder,\\" which becomes a harrowing screech. But, as the last verse said, \\"love is just a kiss away.\\" You don't have to face the madness of the world alone.<br /><br />I got the album right away.  Interestingly, the Stones let go of the intensity of that first song, which gives way to the beautiful reading of Robert Johnson's \\"Love in Vain,\\" followed by three songs in a somewhat comical mode. Side two started with \\"Midnight Rambler\\" which was wonderfully ambiguous. Were we supposed to hate him or admire him?  Plus, that song is one of Charlie Watts' best drum songs, with all the changes of pace. Then, Keith sings something romantic, Jagger sends up the Stones' image in the brilliant \\"Monkey Man,\\" and finally, they get serious again in \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" which is as close as the Stones or any other rock group gets to something like the \\"Ode to Joy\\" in Beethoven's Ninth. It is the perfect bookend to \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  Nicky Hopkins' plays a joyous gospel piano solo at the end, and I think it's Billy Preston on the organ here.<br /><br />The remastering of all the Stones' albums is wonderful, but this one seems like the topper.  The acoustic songs especially have a wonderful sense of space. The original production by Jimmy Miller was brilliant here, as it was on all the albums he did with them.  Miller's the one who mixed Watts' drums way up so we could hear how great he was. He's the one who dirtied up the guitar sounds.  His contribution to the Stones' legacy cannot be underestimated.<br /><br />If you don't have this, go for it.rfect bookend to \\"Gimme Shelter.\\"  Nicky Hopkins' plays a joyous gospel piano solo at the end, and I think it's Billy Preston on the organ here.  <br /> <br />The remastering of all the Stones' albums is wonderful, but this one seems like the topper.

0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha is a novel about an individual's journey to self-discovery and enlightenment. On his path to manhood, Siddhartha encounters many \\"teachers' who influence his life. The novel is recommended for those seeking to find peace within. Hermann Hesse's conscious craftsmanship allows for an in-depth look at Buddhism, the human mind, and paternal relationships. Specific paragraphs are quite verbose and prior knowledge of Eastern cultures is required to fully comprehend the novel. Collectively, this novel is worth a read because it teaches many valuable lessons. Give this novel a try and you too can be on the path to enlightenment.
B0001MDP3G|5.0|There have been many movies told about the Civil War.  However, few of those movies have focused on the backwater towns that provided many of the men who fought and died in that awful conflict.  This movie does exactly that.  The focus is on two average people in a small community that is quite likely to be similar to many other small communities across the United States at that time.<br /><br />Jude Law is Inman, a rather shy man who is smitten with Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), the daughter of new minister Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland).  Ada is very sheltered from the realities of life and enjoys many of the smaller luxuries available to genteel Southern society.  All this changes when the Civil War begins.  Inman goes off to fight in the war, and her father dies.  Now Ada has no money and no help.  Things look grim for Ada until brash but practical Ruby Thewes (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger) arrives to assist her.  We learn of Ruby's character when she quickly converts a rooster into food, shocking Ada in the process.<br /><br />Though Ada and Ruby manage to cope, things around town have deteriorated.  A gang of thugs take advantage of every opportunity to exert their exaggerated authority over the town and the valley.  As the movie progresses so too does the brutality of the thugs, who are supposedly the security for the town.  Eventually they brutalize and murder a family.  Yet, we see that there are others like them throughout the South.<br /><br />Inman is injured during the battle of Petersburg.  He thinks of Ada and the few letters her received from her as he convalesces.  The words that stick in his mind are her pleas for him to return home.  Quicker than you can say \\"deserter,\\" Inman is trekking across the countryside to return to Ada.  Inman's journey becomes an epic as he battles brutal Northerners, more Southern thugs, and consoles a beautiful widow.<br /><br />We know that at the end of the movie there must be a showdown between the major characters, and the ending is too good to give away so I leave it to viewers to discover the ending for themselves.<br /><br />This movie has received much press and many accolades, receiving an Oscar for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger's incredible performance, which is critical to the success of this movie, and thirteen other awards and forty-nine nominations.  This movie is certainly a very good movie, but I think it shines more because too many modern movies have forsaken plot and acting for special effects, loud noises and blood.  This movie retreats to those characteristics that make movies art and allow movies to vie with books.  Modern audiences are so hungry for a genuine story and real acting that they have launched this movie into the category of a modern classic.  When you get tired of watching yet another video game become movie whose total plot consisting of racking up a body count, try popping this one into the DVD player and remember what it is like to have a story and serious acting.d the ending is too good to give away so I leave it to viewers to discover the ending for themselves. <br /> <br />This movie has received much press and many accolades, receiving an Oscar for Rene Zellweger's incredible performance, which is critical to the success of this movie, and thirteen other awards and forty-nine nominations.

0307276902|2.0|I am one of the many people who kept hearing about how good A Million Little Pieces was. I love to read and when I come across a book that has so many positive reviews, I really can't help myself. I have read some of Oprah's recommended books before and some were good, while others kind of sucked. A Million Little Pieces in kind of in the middle. I really didn't see what the big deal was. Everyone kept talking about how wonderful this book was but I seriously had to skip a bunch of pages because it was just boring to read. There were some parts that were interesting but for the most part Frey whines a lot, eats, sleeps, makes out with Lilly, and acts like the \\"tough guy\\". <br />Lilly really got on my nerves. I just hated how she was always boo hooing. Same with Frey's mom. Lord, I had to skip pass all that BS. And why even save Lilly, why even care? I knew she wasn't going to get any better and she was kind of nasty. I didn't feel sorry for her at all. I really don't think I would recommend it to anyone.
B00003CWMI|4.0|Synopsis: Generations of people are born and die. One robot is the unchangable, immortal witness of their lives. Then he also decides to become mortal and die along with them. You get to see how the hospital of the future will look (it's quite beautiful). And there is some nice jazz muzic in the middle of the movie. The song is originally performed by Nat King Cole, and has memorable, romantic lyrics:<br /><br />\\"The very thought of you,<br />and I forget to do,<br />the little ordinary things<br />that everyone ought do...\\"<br /><br />The movie starts in an innocently playful way, with some family buying a robot, and the kids treating it like a broken toy, in a rude and unfriendly manner. Then gradually, the robot becomes more intelligent, capable of emotions and making money with his skills. Then he gets the desire to become human. Centuries pass by, and he is not granted acknoledgement, that he is human, because of his robotic brain. It kind of reminds me of an immigrant who wants to become an american, but can't fully complete the transformation, because he was born elsewhere.<br />Finally, the robot becomes mortal and dies, just a moment before he is granted the acknowledgement that he is human.<br /><br />Because the story happens in the future, it's hard to imagine something that has lasted 200 years. I was thinking that the US Dollar has existed for about 200 years, so you could say that George Washington, the dead president on the dollar bill, is a bicentennial man. And I'm sure that after about 180 years, they will talk about the immortal, bicentennial Personal Computer (PC).<br /><br />I remove one star from the rating, because the ending is sad, the hero dies. The movie's producers could have allowed the robot to live eternally, as I am sure this will happen with real robots. Their bodies will wear out, but their souls will be immortal... like records on a DVD.<br />For any viewer concerned about aging and death, this movie may be thought-provoking.
0385338082|2.0|I have liked previous books by this author and heard good things about this book, so I thought I would enjoy it.  I love chick lit and am always looking for a fun breezy book.  I really did not care for \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\"-overall I thought it was average.  The characters never seemed real, the romance was never developed and felt fake at times, and it almost seemed like a long drawn out plot for a soap opera.  A few parts made me laugh, but all in all I thought the plot to be very weak and unrealistic.  I found myself sympathizing more for the dumped boyfriend than cheering on the new love interest.  If you're looking for a light fluff book you can finish quickly without thinking, then I would pick this book.  But I most likely will never read it again and I would recommed any of the Shopaholic novels over this one anyday.

But they rebel against their creators, and want to live longer than the pre-encoded 4 year life span. They manage to find and kill their creator (Doctor Tyrell). But \\"the Bladerunner\\" (a police detective played by Harrison Ford) finds and destroys them all. Except for one (a replicant of Tyrell's niece) whom he falls in love with.<br /><br />With very romantic soundtrack mellodies, composed by Vangelis, and fantastically beautiful buildings from the Los Angeles of the future, this movie is a sci-fi classic, setting the standards for generations of movies to come.<br />The story is analogous with the problems of immigrants who want to stay in America, but the INS denies them the rights to do so.<br /><br />I would recommend the original film, not the director's cut.<br />The director's cut has a sad end, confirming that the beloved Rachel (the replicant that the Bladerunner falls in love with) will die, like anyone else.<br />The original film has a more uplifiting end, saying \\"I don't know how long we have together... who does?\\"<br />It's like with this amazon online bookstore. I don't know for how many years it will exist. Who does?
B00005JNQA|2.0|I should have guessed that Sean Penn and Hollywood would become increasingly unable to make good decent film without using them as a springboard for their political views (most of which are wrong of course).<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film and only gave it 2 stars because of Nicole Kidman.<br /><br />The story plods along SLOWLY and PAINFULLY with no tension, no anxiety.... in fact, you dont care for any of the characters in the least.<br /><br />This feels like on of those 70s films like \\"All the Presidents Men\\" that simply puts you to sleep.<br /><br />Lost of talk and attempts at creating a storyline about attempting to stop the supposed assassination of some tyrannical leader of a 3rd world country.<br /><br />It's hard to care to much if he gets knocked off or not.<br /><br />Penn and Kidman's characters seem stilted and stiff.<br /><br />Simply put...... the film has ZERO suspense, ZERO tension, and stirs ZERO interest for the characters.<br /><br />It simply does not come together and WORK like a good \\"magical movie\\" like Shawshenk Redemption, Door to Door, Straight Story or other great non-action movies do.<br /><br />A high budget clunker.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Although this movie is dark and has no humor in it,<br />it is worth seeing. It has a gripping sci-fi story about a cyborg machine that comes from the future to kill the guy who would become its enemy. The special effects were good at the time. It gave birth to the classic phrase \\"I'LL BE BACK!\\"<br />It even starts with a scene from the vicinity of Los Angeles, which you can visit in real life.<br /><br />This movie (along with \\"Total Recall\\") helped Arnold Schwarzenegger to enter into the genre of sci-fi movies. Until that moment, he was just playng muscle-man barbarians.<br />The word \\"Terminator\\" has become almost a household name, and some people nowadays call Arnold \\"the governator\\" (a mixture of governor and terminator).<br /><br />Just one warning: do not try to repeat at home the things that the Terminator does: i.e. looking dead serious, killing women, crashing cars into buildings, saying things like \\"f... you as.....\\" etc.
1594200106|5.0|As I was reading Carlos Ruiz Zafon's THE SHADOW OF THE WIND I kept thinking this could easily make its way to the number one spot on my favorite book list.  About halfway through I knew it would definitely end up in the top ten.  As other reviewers have pointed out there are flaws both in the plot and characterizations, and liberal melodrama to be sure, but not overdone in my opinion, as the heroic elements take this otherwise bildungsroman to a higher level (yet not quite \\"excellent literary fiction\\"), all the while rendering a story of great entertainment.<br /><br />It could be an easy read if you want it to be, but there is enough substance to THE SHADOW OF THE WIND to keep even the stodgiest litt&eacute;rateur engaged.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|This album is, in a word, relentless. It is also a bigger and badder brother to Violent Revolution, if you will. If you were dissapointed with Renewal, Cause for Conflict, Outcast, or Endorama, pick up this and VR - you will not be dissapointed. I personally enjoy nearly all of Kreator's stuff, but there are some fans who were thrown off by many of their 90s albums, saying they lost their way with experimentation. I think the different directions were a good thing, but they definitely went back to the basics with Violent Revolution, and I think that was a great thing. With Enemy of God, they have taken that back to basics vibe and run with it, creating an album that has the classic thrash feel with a modern flavor for 2005. The guitars are clear and thick, the drums are full, the vocals are harsh and angry as ever, and the music is fast. The title track kicks off the album with a classic speed riff into a fast thrash beat, quickly changing key into a verse that takes you back to the days of Extreme Aggression and Coma of Souls. If these were your favorite Kreator albums, you will be very pleased with this one. Overall, a great metal record for 2005. Top songs include the title track, \\"Impossible Brutality\\", \\"Voices of the Dead\\", \\"Dying Race Apocalypse\\", and \\"One Evil Comes, a Million Follow\\".
B000002UZ1|5.0|Perfect collection of The Beatles' latter day years. Of course there are numbers missing, but that's because this band, the best, put out such great music and in such great quantity. It's more-rounded than the (great) \\"1\\" collection. <br />Attention Mr. J. Dunn. The \\"Let It Be\\" version here is the one, I think, that appears in the \\"Let It Be\\" film, where the guitar solo isn't distorted. The \\"Let It Be\\" album version has the distorted guitar solo. It's rumored that Paul played the guitar solo in one version (the distorted version, possibly?) and George played the guitar solo in the other (the clean guitar solo, I think, at least he does in the \\"Let It Be\\" film.) It's not revisionist history, as you might think. Both versions were recorded during that time period. The \\"Let It Be\\" version on this 1967-70 CD is the same version that appeared on the 1973 vinyl version of this \\"Blue Album.\\" <br />Peace.
B00005KB9T|5.0|On some RARE occasions in music, sumpin' magical is happening. An' is' not NEARLY as often as people give credit to. Thas' not to say that other artists aren't talented, memorable, innovative an' earth-shatteringly amazing. But we're talkin' MAGICAL; thas' sumpin' altogether different, like the mother ocean jus' completely STOPPING to reflect on it's own vastness an' history.  <br /> <br />Bob Marley an' the Wailers is what I consider sumpin' MAGICAL in music. E'ything from the gritty politically-charged sways of 'Concrete Jungle' an' '400 Years' where the land of liberty seems to be jus' over the horizon to the beautiful love an' eternal companionship espoused on 'High Tide Or Low Tide'. In the hook of 'Stop that Train' when he says \\"It won't be too long, whether I'm right or wrong,\\" you'll realize that it don' require a fat nicely-rolled spliff to get into the groove of the Rastafarian's world (though I'll admit, it don't hurt). Tunes like 'Slave Driver' an' 'No More Trouble' become about more than what maybe they're even intended to be about; these're the Gospel hymns of the proletariat; the commoners; the oft-ignored an' oft-exploited.    <br /> <br />If you're only goin' to own one reggae album, then this, er, well, lemme say first I'll slap 'ya silly an' ask what in the HELL is wrong wit' you!?!? But, then once I've accepted that not everyone's gonna have the same opinion as me, I'll point to this album as the ONE. Besides, once you own this, you're gonna end up needin' more anyways.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Aside from the two attractive leads there is little to recommend this film. Certainly not the story. Two killers married to each other, keeping their respective careers a secret until one day they're contracted to hit the same target.

0812975219|5.0|\\"You make your own luck\\" or \\"It's all a crapshoot.\\" Which describes your point of view? Nassim Taleb believes chance plays a bigger role than most of us acknowledge.<br /><br />Fooled By Randomness is Taleb's way of distilling all his thoughts on the nature of chance. He throws in math (statistics and probability), philosophy, trading, economics, pop culture, classical literature, and psychology to come up with a book that's fun to read and that leaves you with quite a bit to think about.<br /><br />Taleb makes a good case for the notion that randomness plays a huge role in practically everything. Philosophically, this is hard to argue with. But our brains want to find patterns everywhere and we refuse to believe that success or failure is largely due to chance.<br /><br />In fact, the whole notion is somewhat un-American. We love to take credit for our successes, even if deep down, we know our success could just as easily have been failure. And we hate to let those who are not successful off the hook by blaming bad luck. If they aren't responsible for their own bad fortune, then what's to keep us from being unlucky?<br /><br />But Taleb doesn't just throw up his hands and say we have no control. He explains, through his alter-ego Nero Tulip, how he trades. By protecting himself from catastrophic market moves, he becomes a more careful, therefore a less successful trader in the short run, but one who survives severe markets and lives to trade another day.<br /><br />This is no how-to book for traders, though. It's an entertaining look at unpredictability and how to deal with it. Chances are, randomness is here to stay.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|This modernistic movie was based on the animated MTV series and a video game about an emotionless female assassin.  In 2011, life on earth was eradicated by some explosive device and the surviving group formed the perfect society called Bregna, ruled over by the Goodchild regime.  The dessident organization out to defeat this was a group who dressed in funky black clothes and used gymnastics and acrobatics to get around the security systems.    Charlize Theron who won an Oscar for playing a real-life 'Monster,' now with a figure like Cyd Charisse, leads the way to the doom of the Goodchilds.  She feels like she is in a gilded cage but has dreams of memories she does not understand.  She said that she had a life once, but now all she has is a mission.  We must show the way.  She agrees to go to the Citadel where they will have their revenge and we will all have victory.  There, in the forum, she confronts Trevor, played by Marton Csokas, and acts like a female John Wilkes Booth until he calls her Catherine which rings a bell.  Nothing is as it seems.    Be careful what you wish for!  Trevor showed her what it felt like to be a person instead of an unfeeling thing.  He told her, \\"We both are still alive for a reason.  Everything changed when I saw you.\\"  Both were clones of the originals and the doctor over the lab told her, \\"I knew you were important, so I saved your DNA.\\"  In a war, people on all sides die.  There would have to be consequences to their indiscreet actions.  He is betrayed by his brother, Orrin, who declared that what he did was treason.    Suddenly, the situation has changed and has become more complicated.  He'd told her, \\"You had your chance, so you know where to find me.\\"  Clones, they realize, are just like ghosts.  I needed to protect you; you are an idea I kept alive.  She agrees, \\"I remembered you.\\"  After their escape, she patched him together again.  We watch a slaughter down among the cherry blossoms and Orrin is defeated.  It's the end results that count in this case, not how pretty the path is getting there.  Aeon climbs aboard the cloning lab in the flying saucer with the gold trailers floating underneath and sets the explosives to destroy it.  After all, we are meant to live only once, but with hope.  The use of the heligraph of the 400-year-old doctor was very effective.  It was a good diversion from the cold weather and Christmas crowds and music.  It was a nice interlude into fantasy and sci fi at its best.
B00004RD54|5.0|It always cracks me up that the same expert critics that dismiss this album as crass give 'Transformer' rave reviews.  That album is every bit the 'dated' cash-in that this one is.  Every bit as contemptuous of the audience as well.  Who really cares?  Imagine Kiss doing an all Velvet Underground musical review and you have an idea about what you're getting here.  In some ways this is excellent proof of Lou's songwriting ability.  It demonstrates that his songs can shine in a variety of arrangements.  I think this is one of his strongest solo albums next to 'Berlin' and 'Street Hassle' - Dark and dirty.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|This cd is a definite must-have in your collection. It's refreshing to hear sophisticated, meaningful, well-written music as opposed to the same-old radio garbage. <br /> <br />You'll be familiar with Daughters and Something's Missing, but with a new, yet groovy spin...much better versions than on the Heavier Things album. <br /> <br />Highlight songs on the album for me are Another Kind of Green and Try....simply wonderful! <br /> <br />If you want to be pleasantly surprised by this cd, go pick up a copy asap!

B00005JNNZ|2.0|This movie is somewhat like Remember The Titans... <br /> <br />It's safe and is 95% a feel good movie with some exceptions.. It <br />also shows signs of being stereotypical.. Good athletic black men <br />taking off to the burbs to hang out with all the white girls and <br />then go back to the dumb black women that always accepts them <br />back. <br /> <br />I couldn't seem to care for any of the characters that are  <br />in the movie. None of them had any personality and overall  <br />just wasn't very interesting... And sorry, But Jackson  <br />doesn't come off as a former basketball player in this one.  <br /> <br />Sorry, it it's just a poor mans Remember The Titans.
1400032717|5.0|A mystery, a dead dog, an autistic boy, a moody father, and a ghost of a mother all make The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon a great read.  <br /> Christopher John Francis Boone is a 15 year old autistic child. Christopher lives with his father, Ed Boone. He was told, 2 years ago, by his father that his mother had died from a heart attack. Christopher one day finds his neighbor's dog, Wellington, dead from being stabbed with a garden fork. This is when he starts on a search to find the killer of Wellington. This narration, told in first person, goes on to tell of Christopher's adventures. He gets arrested for hitting a police officer, questions neighbors, and is told off by his dad not to bother other people.  Christopher also tells us of his habits and particulars; liking the color red and disliking anything yellow, counting red and yellow cars, his love of math and numbers and not liking physical contact with people are his main particulars. Christopher also tells us many interesting things, like the meaning of his name, books he enjoys and why, and famous math and logical problems and their solutions. Christopher eventually gets on a train to leave his father and find his mother. <br /> I especially liked the character of Christopher in this well-written book. He is an independent, confident, and sometimes a brutally truthful guy. Though he can seem a bit overwhelming with his slightly random facts, he is really a character that stands out. Even if he is autistic, Christopher can be unpredictable, in good and bad ways. When he is on a train, trying to hide from a policeman that is bringing him back home, Christopher uses the toilet. \\"Then I went out of the toilet and I saw opposite the toilet there were two shelves with cases and a rucksack on them and it made me think of the airing cupboard at home and how I  climb in there sometimes and it makes me feel safe\\"(163). He was very discreet and quick.  <br /> This captivating book gluesyour eyes to every page. Through out it all is the message of discovering life and its limits. Christopher pushes as far as he can before going over. He runs away, walks around in the middle of the night, and doesn't eat if he wants to. Unless someone specifically tells Christopher not to do something, he will keep doing what he feels like doing. Throughout the book, as Christopher began to feel frustrated and understated, I began to feel that way too. I felt that there was a voice inside him that couldn't be heard. You began to feel a connection between you and the main character. This is what makes the book so powerful. As the book goes on, Christopher and the people in his life come to understand him too.  <br /> This novel is compelling, remarkable, and contains incidents that everyone can relate to. I enjoyed reading this novel with a slight twist in the mystery. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a novel that really lets you connect with the handicapped main character.  <br />
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Alright, I'm sure you've read other reviews by now... <br /> <br />Tom Cruise plays a contract killer out to kill 5 people in <br />one night and uses a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to drive him <br />around. <br /> <br />This movie had the potential to be really good... I mean, Cruise <br />and Foxx in a action flick? The problem is that Cruise is abit <br />robotic in his behavior... Perhaps that's part of the point that <br />he is a cold hearted killer.. <br /> <br />However, he simply wasn't ever fully able to make me believe that <br />he is realistic. His behavior is not consistant... Sometimes he <br />does well, but other times he makes sloppy mistakes that you  <br />really wouldn't expect a professional to do. <br /> <br />Also, the movie works it's hardest to be completely realistic and <br />that's a blessing in some ways, but in other ways it's a ledown. <br />I do like realistic movies, but not to the point to where it does <br />hurt the action... Until the end, there simply isn't enough action. <br /> <br />It's a well acted movie other than Cruise... Jamie does well and <br />the some of the wise cracks and a few scenes were good. It's  <br />very close to being a B movie.. And honestly, this movie was a <br />big sign that Cruise is losing his star power because he simply <br />can't hold this movie up.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've only seen bits and pieces of Wicked on television and missed it when it toured my city. However, knowing that Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are in it, I knew it was a winner and between the cast album and feedback from family who saw the show confirmed it.<br /><br />As with most musical soundtracks, it can be challenging to figure out what's happening just from the songs alone as action and talking occurs between songs. To overcome this, just do a search the Internet for the show's synopsis. Here's a short synopsis of the show as explained on the show's official Web site:<br /><br />\\"Long before Dorothy dropped in, two other girls meet in the Land of Oz. One, born with emerald-green skin, is smart, fiery and misunderstood. The other is beautiful, ambitious and very popular. How these two unlikely friends end up as the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good Witch makes for the most spellbinding new musical in years.\\"<br /><br />After listening to the music, I'm eager to read the book and find another opportunity to see the show. Thankfully, the CD comes with the song lyrics, so those of us with less than perfect hearing can follow better.<br /><br />It's rare that I find a new musical that I want to repeatedly listen to its CD. The last CD that accomplished this came out over a decade ago. Wicked has joined my replay list and it's wicked good! After listening to this, any questions as to why the show won many Tony Awards are answered.<br /><br />As soon as the music plays, Chenoweth and the Citizens of Oz sing \\"No One Mourns the Wicked,\\" which goes back to the scene we all know about from the original story - the wicked witch is dead. The song jumps at you with its striking minor harmonies and grabs you and takes you on a captivating back story of the witches and other Ozian characters.<br /><br />In \\"Dear Old Shiz,\\"Chenoweth and the students sing about Galinda's (better known as Glinda, the Good Witch of the North in Wizard of Oz) and Elphaba's (Wicked Witch of the West) school days in which the two witches end up as roommates. They sing of their first impressions and how they loathe each other in \\"What Is This Feeling?\\"<br /><br />Eventually, they become friends and Glinda gives Elphaba a make over to help her become \\"Popular.\\" However, Glinda tells Elphaba, \\"You'll be popular, just not as quite as popular as me!\\" This is the best song on the soundtrack with its sharp lyrics and peppy beat. As the soundtrack progresses you learn more and more of the \\"true?\\" story of Oz. It's delightful soundtrack that is easily worth playing many times. Even other household members of different ages agreed.ked Witch of the West) school days in which the two witches end up as roommates.

B00005JO1R|5.0|2005 was a lackluster year for films. There were very few movies that were really knockouts. The one standout film for the year was \\"Walk the Line,\\" the Johnny Cash bio-pic.<br /><br />In an era when films are full of darkness and lack good, quality storytelling, \\"Walk the Line\\" was a glimmer of hope. Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the Man in Black is startling, proving that he is one of the most versatile actors in hollywood. There were a few times when I thought that it really was Cash up there, and not an actor. Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. She plays here as both a spit-fire and a compassionate friend who saves Cash from....well, Cash. It's these two performances that give the film it's soul, and the fact that the two stars did all their own singing makes it a very impressive film. The supporting cast, such as Ginnifer Goodwin, Robert Patrick, and Dallas Roberts as Sam Phillips, are solid.<br /><br />The 2-Disc Collector's Edition for the film is a must-have for Cash and movie collectors. The extras are excellent, including a featurette about Johnny's historic concert at Folsom Prison, where he emerged as the Man in Black.<br /><br />\\"Walk the Line\\" is an exceptional film with fantastic acting, fine storytelling, and excellent music that will have your toes tapping before the end. I highly recommend this film for fans of Cash, and for movies buffs as well.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I first learned about this show from two good friends of mine.  They mentioned it but I didn't pay much attention really.  Then the movie came out and I still didn't make the connection, until I spoke to them again.  I went online and read the reviews.  I have NEVER seen this many 5 star reviews for anything.  I realized that I must be missing out on something great so I purchased both the series and the movie simultaneously.  I also started to record the series on TV and watched them too.  One episode is all it took.  Everything everyone is saying is true.  I am a rocket scientist and just the fact that there is no sound in space was enough for me.  Anyone that would have taken the time to think about something like that and the nerve to make a show without sound in space (like it is supposed to be) had my never ending respect.  I've seen all of the episodes (finished them last night) but haven't seen the movie.  Best money on a series I have ever spent.  When are they going to realize this show needs to be brough back?  We all seem to understand it, when will \\"they\\".
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Michael Buble's show at the Singapore Indoor Stadium October 10th 2005 ranks as the BEST concert I've ever attended ( out-jostling even Sting and Robbie Williams ), and this DVD is an absolute must for MB fans, as well as those who have yet to discover his wonderful talent. <br /> <br />This is a beautifully produced event, and Mike gives his all both vocally and emotionally. His renditions of You Don't Know Me and Home are flawless, the Maroon 5 routine hilarious, the rapport with his audience undeniable.  <br /> <br />The concert itself is at least 90 minutes long, but trust me, you'll hardly feel it, and will probably clamour for more. Check out the bonus track - a duet with Chris Botti on an additional performance of Song For You, which took my breath away. <br /> <br />Having met Mr. Buble during his visit to Singapore, I'd just like to state for the record that he's just as warm, sincere and cheeky backstage as he is in front of thousands. He doesn't just pander to the cameras. This lovely man is the real thing. <br /> <br />So please, get out there and BUY THIS. It's fantastic, he deserves our full support, and while you're at it, why not grab an extra copy and convert a friend or relative? :) <br />

B00000K19E|4.0|\\"No one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it yourself,\\" exclaims Morpheus. Indeed, you have to see it. Suggest that the DVD itself is the red-pill; by purchasing this, you are gulping down that red pill with an icy cup of water and you are tumbling down into the computerized rabbit hole, the Matrix. Ultimately, you get to join the unbelievable quest of Neo once again, dodging bullets, doing Kung fu kicks and finally, wearing a good-looking outfit and a cool pair of sunglasses. <br />    The movie The Matrix, created by the Wachowski brothers Andy and Larry, is one of the best science fiction movies out there. While other sci-fi movies are filled with cute beeping sounds of robots and zaps of laser guns which have been repeated so much that it is almost disgusting, this movie decides to portrays a closer, a more plausible reality, a reality where humans are defeated by A.I (artificial intelligence) and are trapped unknowingly in a virtual reality named Matrix. It is a feast to the eyes with its impressive graphics including the ever so popular `Bullet-time\\", while it also manages to grasp the audience with a very philosophic and religious tale about a Messiah of computer programs.  <br />     The story begins with the introduction of Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves), who lives a striking double-life; at morning he stays as the typical Mr. Anderson and works for MetaCortex, a major software company. At night, he prefers being Neo, a hacker selling illegal programs. However, he is taken custody by Agent Smith, a guardian program of the Matrix who sees Neo as a potential threat to the system. Fortunately, Neo is saved from his clasps by a band of rebels including Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who frequently wreck havoc in the Matrix system by hacking into it. From them, he realizes that the world around him actually is a computer program made by A.I robots to keep humans imprisoned in a dreamland, while their bodies are used as a means of energy sources. Neo also learns that it is he who will presumably be the One, an almighty figure powerful enough to destroy the Matrix itself. Thus begins Neo's path to brighten reality, but things get wobbly right from the beginning; there is a traitor in the midst.  <br />     The Matrix is compact of greatly improved actors. Keanu Reeves, the rookie star of the action-movie \\"Speed\\", is done with stopping bus explosions set up by a madman. Instead, he now faces a much bigger, heavier burden; he has to rescue the whole humanity! As I watched the movie, I could not hide my amazement; Reeves seemed to have matured considerably, confronting such a humongous task of being the One. His acting of utter shock and awe as he first learns of the Matrix is thoroughly realistic; I just wondered how I would have reacted, seeing Reeves muttering \\"No!\\" and then falling to the ground, spinning around in shock. Carrie-Anne Moss also does a great job; she depicted Trinity's character successfully. It's interesting to see a bit of a contrast between Trinity of the real and the virtual; a soft, sincere and caring woman turns into a fiery combat machine! My heart thrilled when she said, \\"Dodge this,\\" shooting Agent Smith right on the head. Laurence Fishburne, as the leader of the rebels Morpheus, creates a sense of authority and acts a spiritual supporter of Neo. His gentle conversations of Neo are filled with confidence, and his voice creates a tranquilizing effect when there is great danger ahead; that is what he has his name for. Lastly, oh, I can never forget him, Hugo Weaving! He does an unbelievable job being Agent Smith, whose goal is ever so simple; to eradicate the One. \\"I hate their smell!\\" He cries out to Morpheus, showing his terrible dislike for humans. He is the perfect rival against Neo, also armed with a snappy suit and the strangely cruel smile of his.  <br />    Also, one cannot easily go over the cinematography of the movie. The Wachowski brothers certainly make us open our mouths at the right beginning. When Trinity faces a mean-looking policeman (who is luckily not an agent), she evades his gunshots by walking sides along the wall and then leaps right infront of him. Just at this moment, time stops, and the scene is rotated 360 degrees in slow motion. And as the rotation stops, Trinity delivers a fatal kick at the policeman's head. The whole progress of this single action scene is so slow, so simple yet so beautiful. Such beauty is shown again at the scene where Neo manages to `dodge' the bullets shot from Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving)'s gun. Again, time freezes and the bullet slowly moves towards Neo, who bends his body backwards to evade the bullets. The cinematography used in this scene is so famous that it even has it's own distinctive name; \\"Bullet-Time\\". Ever since this movie, this method has been used by way too many other movies. Finally, I would pick the lobby battle scene as the epitome of the Wachowski brother's skills. Neo and Trinity slowly kill the policemen, doing somersaults and cartwheels, and wasting plenty of bullets, It almost glorifies violence; I didn't feel sorry for all those men being killed. I actually hummed along with the exciting music, hypnotized by such artistic fight sequences.  <br />   The DVD, apart from such a masterpiece, also features a satisfactory introduction on how the movie was made. It also explains some of the cinematography involved in the movie, especially how `Bullet-time' was created. I was amazed at how the Wachowski brothers arranged at least 60 cameras around Keanu Reeves to create the effect.  <br />    Despite such greatness, movies after all, are made by humans, not by robots nor the One. The Matrix does have some tiny flaws. While I watched the movie, I just had to admit that the movie was mainly created for the mass population, who are easily lured and fascinated by some tricky graphics or cool action scenes. I had hoped that the movie might focus more onthe tone and seriousness of the whole situation (that robots rule the world), rather than concentrate on the video game-like fight scenes. I had hoped that the movie would really pull us into the rabbit hole and emit a strongly philosophical topic, which would permanently stay fixed on one's mind, but when the movie ended, we were forcefully popped out from the hole, and the philosophy evaporated. Though it was a good attempt, The Matrix wasn't able to satisfy people who were really puzzled about the world, whether it is real or not. Watching it is like having a soup that is neither hot nor cold; it is just `it'.  <br />    Overall, The Matrix is quite an awesome movie. It presented to us a whole knew theory; that the world one is living in might not be the world that another knows, with the help of great actors. In addition, some spectacular action scenes spiced up the movie, thanks to the innovative minds of the Wachowski brother. As the first tale of the Matrix trilogy, this movie has great significance. One would be buying the DVD with the pleasure that he is going to `see' the matrix itself, ensured that he is going to enjoy it. Come on, take the red pill, and `hack' in! <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|I tried with all my might to resist the mighty slab of rock that was \\"Permission to Land\\" years ago. Why? Being a devout fan of all that is true and rocking, I felt that to fall prey to the ironic yet anthemic and catchy spell that this Darkness band cast through walls of Marshall stacks would be blasphemy!!! \\"Why is this band so popular?\\" I'd ask myself with disgust, \\"what about Thin Lizzy, Ac/Dc, Boston...even Queen!!Who needs this \\"Darkness\\"? I tucked the album away, yet did not throw it out...this act alone spoke volumes...I even went to see the band with my girlfriend, on her behest!!! To further add insult to injury, she herself does not own a single 70's rock album!!! Not one!!! This only fueled my hatred for what I felt to be an affront to all I hold near and dear...my precious rock.<br /><br />  Years pass, \\"One way ticket to hell...and back\\" is released. I set aside my bias, and I did what one is supposed to do when one listens to a rock record-I just listened...as I listened, I laughed. I rocked. I laughed some more. I sang along...like, REALLY sang along. I had come out of the closet, and I felt good. I told myself, \\"I am a Darkness fan\\", and it felt good, as if deep down inside, I knew it all along.<br /><br />  My girlfriend isn't very pleased about my epiphany-I kinda ruined the show for her a couple years ago. She's a little bitter about it. Oh well. I may not have her in a couple of years, but I'll still have my Darkness records...and those are a good time-guaranteed.

B000BOH8XW|1.0|Shakira is one of those artists I just cant possibly comprehend how she has made it in the music business.  She is most obviously a product of the music industry and is someone THEY want to see become a huge success.  Somone had to have shilled out alot of money because this untalented, \\"produced talents\\" music seems to have become prectically unavoidable lately! Unfortunately it appears that my generation once again is EATING the crap they are almost force fed by the big shots in this industry.  I am a regular red blooded American male but even I have grown tired of watching Shakira roll around on countless floors and beds and continually pump her breasts to the beat of her music in her videos! Her doing this in EVERY video really makes her come across as a HO and a sex object.  Guess this is all an attempt to distract the viewer from the fact that her singing isnt that great.  I am very open to all different kinds of music and never judge an album until I have heard it in its entirety.  I can in all honesty say this could be the worst album I have previewed this year.  Her voice is shriller and harsher then ever and many of the songs are just down right HOKEY.  The album really should have a WARNING lable on it as I know I personlly experienced nausia, headache, chills, and restlessness while giving this one a listen.  I could go on and on believe me but instead I will close with a letter to all those from my generation...... STOP BUYING CRAP LIKE THIS .  DEMAND REAL TALENT AND SUPPORT ARTISTS WHO REALLY HAVE SOMETHING TO OFFER. <br /> <br />New Releases I Recommend -  <br />*Madonna- Confessions on a Dance Floor <br />*Alanis Morissette - The Collection
B0009QBLA8|5.0|You could buy a bad copy of this film from one of the external vendors.  But to get a good copy of Eraserhead, you have to go to DavidLynch.com, where the director sells a remarkably pristine transfer dvd in an unconventional but cool package.  It is a really nice disc to own, and well worth making the extra effort to buy it on his site.  I got mine in a week or so, and it looks very good (they put a lot of work into getting the details just right) and has some nice extras.  Apart from wanting to get the transfer right, I think another reason Lynch decided to do it himself was that he dislikes features on dvds that allow you to skip around from chapter to chapter.  If you are going to see his movie, he wants you to see it in order.  I do think that is his prerogative as an artist.  I can't even get my disc to fast forward any faster than the lowest speed, and I believe that is by design, for much the same reason.<br /><br />** Update: Since I wrote this it turns out that the director's approved dvd of this film has appeared for sale here on Amazon.  It is the one that has \\"2000\\" on its cover.  The actual dvd appears to be identical with the copy I purchased from David Lynch's website, with the difference that you get it in a normal dvd case and not the bizarre oversized case that I have.
0385510454|4.0|I can't say enough about this book. The only reason I can't give this 5 stars is because if I did there wouldn't be anything to improve upon. I particularly liked that the little Italian town was described so vividly for the simple reason that it was a central part of this book. This was the first Grisham book I read and since the time I read this when it came out I have read 3 more of his titles. Awesome book, I can't say enough.

0060958324|5.0|A couple of years ago, an editor (whom I had hired to help give my book \\"A Reason for Living\\" a final polish before publication) wrote to me a heartening letter of appreciation, the last part of which steered me very propitiously onto \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,\\" by Robert M. Pirsig. The half autobiographical, half philosophical nature of my book apparently reminded him of Mr. Pirsig's work. Now that I have read this remarkable work, I see the connection, both at the level of style and content, and confessedly delight in it. There is hope after all for a book that daringly challenges mainstream literary categories or straddles two of them by blending a personal epic with extensive philosophical insights.<br /><br />What above all took a firm hold on my attention is the author's perspective of the nature of reality; that is, our human reality, which is the only one to which we have access. His entire discourse about Quality - as the very core of our lives that bridges the divide between art and science - is definitely on target, smack in the middle. It scores all the more points with me as I myself buck at every materialistic worldview that is blind to its spiritual foundation.<br /><br />By spiritual foundation I mean the human spirit behind every human endeavor, including scientific ones.  In fact, reality as we know it is nothing but a spiritual reality, again in the sense that it is all happening between our two ears in the form of sensations and thoughts, and that it is suffused with feelings and value judgments that constitute the heart of the matter. Furthermore, strictly speaking, reality as we know it is nothing but the spiritual reality peculiar to each of us as individuals. The assumption that part of it (the part that concerns other people and things, distinguishable from ourselves) refers to a reality that exists independently of us is precisely that, an assumption, and a metaphysical one to boot, if also reasonable. A less reasonable assumption would be that other people and things, distinguishable from ourselves, are an illusion, a dream or a nightmare depending on how we look at it - a mere extension of ourselves that proceeds from some mysterious principle that inheres in our spirits.<br /><br />Needless to say, the assumption that the world reasonably distinguished from ourselves can be limited to our perception of it or can amount to a \\"material\\" aggregate of microscopic things is not only metaphysical in the extreme; it is laughably fantastical or at least indefensibly presumptuous and narrow. Indeed, the idea that something can be exclusively \\"material,\\" when our reality is exclusively spiritual, is bordering on the insane for it is devoid of a rational basis. I would go so far as to say that our scientific culture, chockablock of \\"material\\" descriptions that are supposed to reveal the alpha and omega of the universe, is fit for the loony bin (this point is particularly ironic because it is also made by Mr. Pirsig, who spent considerable time at the asylum, as though it were him whose mind was derailed). The word \\"material\\" simply refers to the world of appearances, and any person endowed with common sense knows that appearances are superficial and can be deceiving, or that people - us included - and things far exceed them. Quite frankly, so-called primitive cultures that indulged in a naïve form of animism were certainly closer to the truth than those among scientists who are so intellectually blinkered that they believe there is nothing more to the world than meets the eye.<br /><br />Yes, as the author of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" eloquently and vehemently points out, it is high time that we wake up from our materialistic slumber and acknowledge the true essence of humanity - and in all likelihood of the universe as a whole: the spirit, driven by feelings and value judgments. Not that we should plunge headlong in the opposite extreme and adopt an anthropomorphic worldview, but that we should remain open to the part of the world that is beyond appearances, beyond the so-called matter, and cannot be experienced but only imagined. Scientists are doomed to stay miserably off the mark, however efficient their material descriptions and predictions may be, until they agree to be poets as well.<br /><br />Laurent Greniern to the part of the world that is beyond appearances, beyond the so-called matter, and cannot be experienced but only imagined.

0684824906|5.0|Pulitzer winner Goodwin has long demonstrated a feel for biography as a gateway into the past. In Lincoln, one of our greatest presidents, she has found an ideal subject for her attention. He is the more interesting to study because, unlike most presidents, who have sought to surround themselves in their cabinets with safe men who think like they do on important matters, Lincoln chose to build a cabinet out of men whose relationship to the president was problematic, if not downright risky.  In 1861, Lincoln persuaded three of his rivals for the Republican nomination -Seward, Chase and Banks-to sit in his cabinet. They owed Lincoln nothing. As a rule, they saw Lincoln as a man of low ability and little promise, president by the accident of geography.  Furthermore, some were enemies who would barely talk to each other. Yet, the cabinet did not dissolve in warfare and Lincoln established firm control over executive decisions, much to the surprise of Seward in particular, who had assumed that he, and not the president, would lead this group and be the true decisionmaker in Washington. In short while, Seward and Banks became firm allies of Lincoln; indeed, Seward became Lincoln's fastest friend in the Washington power ranks. When Stanton joined the cabinet as secretary of war, he too was converted to allegiance to Lincoln although he had publicly slighted him years before. The only cabinet member whose loyalty remained suspect was Chase, whose lust for the presidency in 1864 blinded him to his own duplicity as he sought to undermine Lincoln and gain support for his own candidacy. Chase was not above political blackmail: three times, he submitted his resignation to Lincoln and three times Lincoln, who valued Chase's substantial ability to get things done in a key office and who would rather have Chase inside his tent than outside, persuaded him to remain. Chase proffered his resignation for the fourth time in 1864. This time, he had overplayed his hand: Lincoln, who by then had secured renomination by the Republican party, no longer needed Chase and didn't need to fear him, so he accepted his resignation without further discussing it with Chase. When Chase heard, he was shocked, even though he'd asked for it.  Lincoln tempered the blow by dismissing Chase's rival in the Cabinet at the same time, maintaining a balance of interests in the group, and when an opening on the Supreme Court became available, he appointed Chase, an act of magnanimity unimaginable in any of Lincoln's successors.<br /><br />Recently, I read a very interesting \\"moral biography\\" of Lincoln's early years (up to 1861), Lincoln's Virtues: An Ethical Biography, by William Lee Miller. Goodwin's fine biography made a good counterpoint to Miller's more limited and focused study. Both made the same point, that Lincoln succeeded as president, and excelled in the role, because he complemented his exceptional political talents and strong intellectual ability with a consistent ethical focus. There has never been another American president with such a strong moral compass as Lincoln and none who heeded it so consistently.en had secured renomination by the Republican party, no longer needed Chase and didn't need to fear him, so he accepted his resignation without further discussing it with Chase.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera is a must see movie, even if you don't like musicals, the music will steal your senses. Emmy Rossum shines as the talented Christine with a powerful soprano voice, Gerard Butler bewitches us with his rough voice as the Phantom, and Patrick Wilson beams as a love from Christine's past, Raoul. A must see movie for people of all ages, it takes place in the Paris opera house, Emmy(Christine), and Gerard(Phantom) take your breath away in beautiful scene's in the Music of the Night and in the The Point of No Return. Patrick(Raoul) will steal your heart when he bellows out in a handsome tenor voice in All I Ask of You. With other names such as Minnie Driver(Carlotta), who sings the final song Learn to Be Lonely, and other greats such as Ciaran Hines, this movie will bewitch the mind and steal the heart, and leave you with the question, if you were in Christine's place...who would you choose?
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I saw an advance screening of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN this week, and what can I say?  As a fan of the original short story that first appeared in The New Yorker in 1997, I was amazed at how the filmmakers so perfectly distilled, yet somehow expanded, the essence of Annie Proulx's prose from the page to screen. Gay or straight, simply put, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is not only the best movie of 2005, but one of the best films I've seen in many years.  Not an image, line, or shot is wasted, as the film is a miracle of economy.  It is by turns erotic, poignant, and finally, heart-breaking.  So what to say about the soundtrack? It's a nearly perfect companion piece to the film.  The sparse acoustic guitar interludes a pitch-perfect for the barren, rugged landscape, while the new songs (especially Emmylou's Love That Will Never Grow Old, Willie Nelson's heartfelt cover of Friend of Mine, and Rufus Wainright's Maker Makes, etc.) are all winners - I don't even mind Linda Ronstadt's It's So Easy - when you see it in the movie, you'll know.  Rufus and Teddy's delightful, slight cover of King of Road doesn't appear in the film...well, actually, the Roger Miller's vintage original does, for just a moment. Again, you'll know it when you see it.  I really hope you see it. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN - the short story, the film, and the soundtrack are all brilliant. Nothing was lost in translation. When I now play the CD, I replay searing scenes from the book - and now the brilliant film - in my head, to devastating effect. As Jack admits, \\"Old Brokeback got us good.\\"
B000AGTPUU|2.0|My husband and I rented the DVD and previewed it before showing it to my 3 year old son who loves trains.  I am very glad that we did that because it was way too scary to be shown to him.  There are several scenes where the children are walking on top of a snow covered train and almost fall off.  Another scene has the train losing control on a lake of ice and then the ice starts to crack.  There is also a mystery ghost man who \\"lives\\" on top of the moving train. I know that all children are different, but I can't imagine letting my son see this movie until he is much older. I suggest that you preview this movie before you give it to the little ones in your life.

B000059T00|5.0|Eric Clapton has worked on several good records, but in my mind none beat Blind Faith's one and only album, aptly titled Blind Faith. Formed in 1969 after Cream's breakup, the group consisted of Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker (both from Cream), Steve Winwood (formerly of Traffic, while they had temporarily broken up) and Ric Grech (a respected studio musician).<br /><br />The first cut to be found here is Winwood's Had To Cry Today, the best cut found on the LP with firey guitarwork by Clapton and nice heavy drums from Ginger. Next up is classic Can't Find My Way Home, another winner with some great lyrics and acoustic guitar. Well...All Right, the third tune, is my least favorite but still a great tune. Presence of the Lord, the album's other resident classic, is my third-favorite. How can somebody like me, somebody who doesn't really care about religon, be into a tune like this? I don't know, but it just keeps calling me back. Actually, the entire album does. Sea of Joy seems like something straight out of Traffic's book, very strange song. Lastly is the underrated Do What You Like, pretty much a long jam with some lyrics tacked on the beginning and end for good measure. The band stretches out and plays for over fifteen minutes, but the song (highlighted by the bass and drum solos) really holds my interest. It could've been my favorite, but no, they have to chant \\"Do what you like\\" over and over and over until your ears hurt. That, and a good minute could've been cut. But it's still a highly enjoyable track I must say! There's just one thing this album needs; a good blues tune. But that can be found on the Deluxe Edition (Which I only have half of) in the form of Sleeping in the Ground.<br /><br />Essential Clapton listening.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I honestly think that no one should listen to the opinions of those putting this album down. <br />I don't mean just about this album, their bashing this album actually questions their knowing anything about music at all and makes their general opinions on music null and void. <br />Why else would Buddy Guy and Eric Clapton, and the like enjoy Mayer so much?  Cause he's so bad?   <br />Why would people as great as Steve Jordan and Pino Pallidino play with him and work on his new album due out in the spring if he wasn't worth working with?  They've worked with big names before...the DON'T need John Mayer to get attention.  Steve Jordan and Pino Pallidino wouldn't not only work with him but they wouldn't work so well with Mayer if he couldn't bring it.  And work well they did on tour.  Each adding something really solid, supporting the music and letting it shine.  Steve and Pino are great and they perfectly compliment John Mayer supplying great parts of their own at all the right moments. <br />John Mayer was trying to do something special and different with this album.  He's accomplished that.   <br />Let's point out that he wrote most of the songs on the album.  And out of those he wrote most of them alone with the exception of a couple.   <br />Give credit where credit is due, and do yourself a favor by picking up this album.  It's worth it. <br />That's not to say this is the best blues album ever.  I do question his re-doing \\"Daughters and \\"Something's Missing\\" with the trio.   <br />Not that they do a bad job of em, but I think it would've made more sense to do \\"Come Back To Bed\\" and I would've loved to hear what they could do with \\"Neon.\\" <br />With that being said, it is the best blues album since Clapton's \\"From the Cradle.\\"  Note that I just compared a LIVE album to a STUDIO album.  That says something else about how on point the JMT are on this.   <br />Buddy Guy was right to say that John Mayer is doing a good thing by keeping the blues alive.  Thanks to the John Mayer Trio, their tour and this album, the blues is alive and well.
B000002LMM|5.0|This soundtrack has it all- totally brings back the weirdness of the tv show but also stands on its own as this hip cool jazz soundtrack. The music is moody, and you can't help but sway to the beat. I esp like the track Freshly Squeezed- includes some great drum work.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|How distressing.Okay I'll give Ashton Kutcher his due for his magnificant debut dramatic performance as Ethan,either a mentally troubles child or a time traveller-by the end I never figured out which.The point is that this movie is not something I would recommend to anyone alone,unless they were made of stone of course.'The Butterfly Effect' is a very sadistic movie.Basically Kutcher's character is jumping through time every time he reads diary enteries made as a result of years of trauma related blackouts.If that sounds complicated it is.This is a difficult film-filled with alot of emotional shocks.But as I stated it is sadistic and violent-in this movie people are beaten,crippled,blown up and even a defencless dog is almost set on fire.Along the way Kutcher falls for a girl who,as he is all too regretful to discover is the cause for all the damage to his own little space-time continuum-thus in order for him to be happy she cannot be in his life or history.People say this has happy ending-it doesn't.Kutcher loses the one thing that he wants more then anything and therefore the ending is anything but happy.It's calm considering all the violence in the movie but a very sad ending anyway you look at it.For those who know little about basic temporal physics 'The Butterfly Effect' probably won't interest you-it's too intense and distressting.Fortunately I am also a Star Trek viewer and unlike many I actually WATCH the show for more then pointless trivia-therefore I have a more then average grip of temporal science.So much so that the idea of insignificant changes in the fabric of time produces major changes in the future is almost hackneyed.Nor do I recommend this to anyone with a known mental problem or heart conditions.But fans of the distressing and dark movies will find this one of the better made.

0345475674|4.0|Fans of National Geographic (if they are old enough) will remember the haunting images of the excavations of Pompeii and Hurculaneum.  When Robert Harris writes the following as the first section heading, \\"Mars, 22 August, 2 days before the eruption,\\" you know that the book is going to cover the details of the eruption.  You also know, because this is Robert Harris, that there is going to be a suspense story going that incorporates the disaster, just as his \\"Fatherland\\" incorporates the Holocaust in a chilling way. <br /> <br />The story: the Aqueduct at Misenum, the Roman naval base on the Bay of Neapolis, has run dry overnight.  The mystery: Pompeii, further up the coast on the same bay, still has water, so there must be a break where the line passes by Mt. Vesuvius.  The complication: the new Aquarius, responsible for the aqueduct, has only been on the job a few days.  The suspense: the old Aquarius has dissappeared, and everyone in town seems very frightened when his name is brought up.  The story follows the new Aquarius as he tries to determine the cause of the water shortage, and to fix it, and to navigate the politics of provincial Rome. <br /> <br />On the balance, we learn more about volcanoes in this book than we do about Romans.  That's okay, though - Harris is the master of telling a story, and placing it in a historical setting (either real, as in this case, or an alternate history like Fatherland).  The story moves at a rapid pace as we march inexorably towards the disaster. <br /> <br />The only problem with the book, which robs it of its fifth star, is the last 50 pages or so.  It is difficult to discuss the ending without giving away key plot points, but with a disaster of this magnitude, you'd think there'd be more deaths among the major characters.  Similarly, I seem to recall from the National Geographic articles that most of those people buried alive by the lava were already dead - victims of the noxious gases that accompany any big eruption.Perhaps Harris decided that people dropping dead from H2S poisoning was not dramatic enough, but it does rob the book of some authenticity at the end.

B000B8QEZG|2.0|Madonna has merely morphed into Ashlee Simpson, Britney, Jessica and Hillary Duff. The music is the same and anyone of the above could have done this cd/album. I respect the fact that her fan base is happy because this cd IS better than recent Madonna efforts. Problem is it is fake music. This album will never stand the test of time. In a year we all will wonder why we even bought it ( me too ! ) and it will be available in huge numbers in used cd stores. Come on, deep inside you know I am right.      I thought Amazon reviews were to help a casual fan decide if they wish to spend their hard earned money on a particular cd. Now I have learned that it is a place where die hard fans write bogus reviews. This is where Madonna and Mariah fans battle it out and that is silly. If Madonna was to sell lint from her clothes many of these same reviewers would be giving it 5 stars.     Why all the personal history and life story stuff about Madonna ? Review THIS product and THESE songs. The fact remains it's just average. If they slipped Cher's \\"Believe\\" onto this album many out here wouldn't have even noticed.
B0001Z642W|5.0|Red Dust, the original on which Mogambo was based, starred Clark Gable and Jean Harlow set in Asia. 21 years later, the remake was in technicolor, shot in Africa and starred Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly.    What made this movie attractive were the 3-dimensional characters - Gable, as the animal trapper Victor, won hands down with his masculine outlook, down-to-earth character, knew-it-all worldly knowledge. Grace Kelly, as the married woman Linda, would steal every one's heart with her elegant beauty. But it was Ava Garner that shone brightly throughout the movie. She was Kelly, the American who fought fiercely, but clumsily and in vain, in her pursuit of Victor's love. She might lose to Linda but beneath her unforgiving remarks about Linda, she had a big and understanding heart. She helped Victor all along and stood up for Victor and Linda when Linda's husband began to suspect. Ava Garner was beautifully portrayed here, both under the camera and in the script. She had wit, courage and adapted well in the jungle. And there was chemistry between Gable and Gardner, whose vulnerable feelings were disguised by their professions and their strong characters.     A thought provoking movie about sophisticated people and mature love. And I couldn't see the ending coming, not until the last minute.

The music is way better then \\"American Life,\\" although, \\"American Life\\" isn't bad music, it's just not my taste. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is the best Madonna album in years, better then both \\"MUSIC\\" and \\"American Life.\\" Although, I will not say it's better then \\"Ray Of Light,\\" it is better then the two previous two albums before \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor.\\"  <br /> <br />My favorite songs on here are all of them!

B00005JOHI|5.0|This adaptation seems more like Emily Bronte than Jane Austen but it's one of the few films which have motivated me to go to a movie theater this year. I was surprised at how well Keira Knightley interpreted Elizabeth Bennett and though Matthew MacFadyen isn't as perfect as Colin Firth was as Fitzwilliam Darcy, this may just be \\"prejudice\\" on my part. Even my Anglophobe husband enjoyed this film but I think that it may be because of lovely Rosamund Pike who plays Jane Bennett. Donald Sutherland is a nice surprise as Mr. Bennett and Dame Judy Dench is magnificent as always in her role as Lady Catherine De Bourg. Go see it if only for the scenery and the feel of the Regency period. You won't be sorry.
B0002YLC24|5.0|One of my all-time favorite shows!  <br /> <br />For those of you who can't stand ambiguity(though not as bad as BEFORE SUNRISE), STAY AWAY.  <br /> <br />I don't want to spoil it for you, but all I can say is this movie takes on different meanings everytime I watch it (which adds to the replay value -- bang for the buck). The conversations flow quickly and the topics are profound and varied. The cinematography, though not jaw-droppingly breathtaking, is nonetheless very pretty. The dialogue is beautifully scripted, and I suppose it helps that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have amazing chemistry. Enough said. It's a beautiful movie, and a must watch!
0393327655|2.0|As an atheist who has grown tired of religious fanaticism, I came to this book with high hopes.  Both the title and description of the book led to expect Harris to introduce some new ideas about the future of faith and reason.  Unfortunately, quite the opposite is true:  \\"The End of Faith\\" is a shoddy rehash of what other authors have already written, followed by political grandstanding unrelated to the book's main idea.   <br /> <br />Yes, religious people often commit atrocities because they base their decision-making on irrational ideas about invisible gods, rather than on the practical consequences their choices will have on fellow humans.  Yes, when members of the religious right rail against the separation of church and state, they sound more like the Taliban than like citizens of a post-industrial democracy.  Yes, the scripture- and religion-based approach to problem-solving is what fuels the very acts of terrorist violence against which American fundamentalists claim to wish to fight.  All of these points are common knowledge to freethinkers and progressives around the globe.  Harris' regurgitation of these facts adds nothing new to the discussion. <br /> <br />To make matters worse, Harris then veers from his thesis midway through his book in order to engage in political axe-grinding.  In the chapter inappropriately titled \\"The Problem with Islam,\\" he criticizes how Noam Chomsky sees a moral equivalence between the supposedly unintentional, non-terrorist killing of foreign civilizans by the militaries of Western governments, and the terrorist attacks intentionally targeting the civilians of those same Western countries.  In equating the two, Harris says, Chomsky ignores \\"the most basic moral distinctions -- between types of violence, and the variety of human purposes that give rise to them.\\"  Invoking the Doctrine of Double Effect, Harris says that the U.S. military's killing of civilians abroad, like its bombing of the Sudanese pharmaceuticals plant in 1998, is qualitatively different from terrorism because the U.S. never intends to cause civilian deaths. <br /> <br />The problem with this argument -- as Chomsky has of course noted, but Harris has presumably not read -- is that governments routinely deny targeting civilians even when overwhelming evidence exists to prove otherwise.  This propensity for lying further complicates the nearly impossible task of surmising a government's intentions.  Therefore the only feasible option for judging a government's actions is by looking to the consequences of those actions.  When one does so, one realizes that the foreign civilians murdered by U.S. Apache helicopters are just as dead as the passengers of Flight 93.  Watching Harris try to take Noam Chomsky to task is like watching a one-legged man participating in an ass-kicking contest -- Harris doesn't stand a chance. <br /> <br />The book then closes with praise for eastern mysticism, leading one to suspect that Harris' agenda all along was not to critique faith and reason, but to attack Christianity and Islam. <br /> <br />All in all, a waste of time.  Check it out from the library if you want to read it, but do not buy it.
B000AOEMXM|1.0|I agree with the above poster.  This is ridicules.  I have been trying to get an explanation about this since I ordered this, seemingly, same set here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AOEN2C/103-3987181-1570227 for a lot less.  They have yet to explain to me the difference other than just there ASIN number.  I mean the description and everything is the same!!!!!  I ordered the set I linked to about 2 weeks ago and it was listed as shipping within 24hours when I ordered it.  And I still haven't gotten it.  It is listed as unavailable now.  Yet his more expensive set pops up at the holidays and is available in 24hours.<br /><br />Why will you not tell me the difference?!?!!!!<br /><br />I am going to send them a 3rd e-mail and see if they can answer my question this time.  This just seems to be a ploy to make more money at the expense of holiday shoppers.  I hope I am wrong!<br /><br />PS:  my one star rating has nothing to do with Enterprise itself, I was required to leave a ratting.  I loved the series and saw all of season 1-3.  want to see the fourth.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Look, if you're reading this review, chances are you are someone you love really knows what the deal is about this show. It's smart, fun, sultry, touching, intelligent, has big explosions, great storylines, and great characters. If you're here, you're likely going to enjoy the DVD. Or whoever you're getting it for. Trust me.
0679422714|1.0|Jung Chang's earlier work, Wild Swans, is itself full of anti-communist propaganda that can easily be refuted with proper research. She is a clear example of someone that has personal reasons for hating Mao and Communism, and facts have little to do with her writing.<br /><br />The Cultural Revolution saw some 3% of the Chinese Communist Party expelled, and it happened because \\"capitalist-roaders\\" hiding in the party were operating to restore capitalism and make a profit in doing so. Millions of workers and students rose up during this time in support of Mao and the Communists. Chang tries to claim her parents were targeted unfairly as innocents that saw Mao as an evil man, but this cannot be confirmed. She clearly has personal reasons for hating Mao and his followers, even if her parents were enemies of the people.<br /><br />This book is ridiculous. The third cousin of the wife of a political enemy of Mao is not a viable source, but this is the sort of nonsense you will find in this book. Literacy went from 15% in China to almost 80% in Mao's lifetime, and middle school enrollment went from 15 million to 58 million. Chang claims Mao did not care about education, equality or anything else, but the facts easily refute her views.<br /><br />Mao did many good things for the Chinese people, and many horrible things attributed to the Chinese Communists were in fact carried out by capitalist-roaders that came to power after Mao's death. Jung Chang is clearly anti-communist for personal reasons, and she has made a name for herself by distorting history and facts to fit her personal views. The anti-communist views in the West have made her a celebrity because she tells them what they want to hear. If you think communism is evil and then someone tells you it is evil, you won't question them.<br /><br />You do not have to agree with Mao's views or Communism in general, but calling this a biography is a sham. This is a great read for people that have already decided that communism and anyone associated with communism is evil. Right-wing, anti-communist historians that agree with the overall view of this book have still commented that it is absurd due to the distortian of history to further the point. Anyone interested in history or political science should stay away from this book unless it is to study propaganda efforts.unism and anyone associated with communism is evil.

B00005JNX0|3.0|This was a good movie.  It is much better the second time around.  I especially liked the penguins. They literally stole the show.     Coming in close second were the Lemurs.  Buy this movie just to see the King Lemur do a version of the Robot Dance.  It's pretty awesome.  Also their rendition of \\"I Like to Move It Move It\\" song!    The animation is stellar.  Most of the actors did well.  I especially liked the hippo.    The problem, I think, lies in Ben Stiller's voice work.  I   really don't think that he is much of an actor.  However, I must admit that he is a much better actor than I am.  Richer too, come to think about it.    There are some interesting movie references.  Some of them are pretty strained and not at all funny.  For example, if I see another riff on Charlie Heston and the Planet of the Apes, I think I'll scream.      In any case, this is an enjoyable picture.  It has adult jokes.  It has kids jokes.    My daughter, who is almost four liked this movie, but not as much as \\"Nemo.\\"    Unfortunately, nothing compares to Pixar.  This will do, though, until the next movie from them comes out.     Update 2-3-05:  I saw this again with my daughter who is now over four.  She loved it, and joked along with quite a few of the lines.  The lemurs are awesome.  This movie is growing on me, but I still hate the planet of the apes reference.  Ben Stiller is, sigh, growing on me as well.
B00004XQ83|5.0|OH MY GOSH....FIRST OF ALL I LOVE THIS MOVIE, AND THEN THE SOUND TRACK IS AWESOME! This soundtrack has all the songs from the movie and all the songs in the movie are great and have a great meaning! <br /> <br />If you have not seen the movie yet, you shoudl probably watch it before buying the soundtrack, just because you might not like the music! Now people who like old-timey country-type music, you should buy the CD! Every song on the CD is great and has a good meaning! I hope my review was helpful to you!
0140187537|5.0|I probably would not have picked this book to read on my own. I was assigned it in an English Literature class at Santa Monica College. I loved it. It is timeless piece of literature. I give this book as a gift to anyone who has ever paid a fortune teller. It is a perfect example of how a seed can be planted.  I give it 10+++++++++++++++.
B00005JNZJ|4.0|Whoever says Aeon Flux is Catwoman 2 is an idiot and should be ignored. This is a very good movie. It's not without it's faults. The director isn't very good when it comes to action scenes and the acting is pretty dry. But there's a solid and original story here and the scenery looks great. Science Fiction movies like this can be extremely difficult to follow (The Matrix) but this director does a very good job of making a complicated story easy to understand.<br /><br />I actually think it was a good idea not to let critics screen this movie in advance. They all typically hate this type of movie. But for people like me, this is great entertainment.<br /><br />I give Aeon Flux an 8 out of 10.
B000059XUI|4.0|Most every movie buff and/or Superman fan knows the story of \\"Superman II\\".  It was filmed back-to-back with \\"Superman\\" by the director of that film, Richard Donner.  For some reason, when \\"Superman\\" was released, the producers fired Richard Donner.  He'd already shot 2/3 of \\"Superman II\\", but for some reason, they wanted him gone.  So The Powers That Be brought in Richard Lester, director of the Beatles documentary \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".  Lester re-shot almost all of Donner's footage and completed the film.  In 1980, the film that was released to theaters was Richard Lester's \\"Superman II\\". <br /> <br />\\"Superman II\\" isn't so much a sequel as it is a continuation, a la \\"The Godfather: Part II\\".  It picks up almost exactly where \\"Superman\\" left off.  Clark Kent/Superman (Christopher Reeve) still loves Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and Lois Lane still loves Superman.  Well, remember those three nasty bad guys from the first movie?  When Superman throws a bomb into space, the waves from the bomb release those three Kryptonian badguys, led by General Zod (Terence Stamp).  But Earth didn't fear - Superman can take 'em, right? <br /> <br />Wrong.  Superman has agreed to sacrifice his powers to be with the woman he loves, Lois Lane.  It's hard to fight three super-evildoers with the same powers as Superman - when Superman has no powers.  How will Krypton's Last Son defeat these alien invaders? <br /> <br />I loved \\"Superman\\", and I loved \\"Superman II\\" very much as well.  Though it's nowhere near as epic as \\"Superman\\", it's still a fine film.  Richard Lester does a fine job as director, though he doesn't compare to Richard Donner.  Ken Thorne's score is very good.  The cast is great - all three Kryptonian badguys are terrific, which includes Sarah Douglas as Ursa and Jack O'Halloran as Non.  Clifton James appears playing the same sort of redneck sheriff he played in the James Bond movies.  The highlight of the film, cast-wise, is Gene Hackman, who is absolutely fantastic as Lex Luthor.   <br /> <br />I would love to see the Richard Donner cut of the film.  It's going to be released on DVD next year so as to coincide with the release of \\"Superman Returns\\", so I'll certainly pick it up then.  But the Richard Lester cut of \\"Superman II\\" is far from a bad film.  It's not the epic blockbuster that \\"Superman\\" was, but it's still a super sequel.
B000002H5I|5.0|This album came out a few years after I was born, and I intitially got into Tracy Chapman because this is one of my father's favorite albums(I'm probably not the typical Tracy Chapman Fan). This album is exceptionally beautiful, and made all that more amazing by the fact that it was her debut effort. This album is definitely a classic, Tracy writes the kind of songs that remind you what really good music is all about. Her Lyrics are filled with great messages that really allow you to get to know her, it's impossible to listen to the tracks on this album and not feel something. I've found that this is definitely the kind of album that people of all ages and with all kinds of tastes can appreciate. I love every song but some of my favorites are: <br />1. Fast Car  <br />2. Talkin' bout a Revolution <br />3. If Not Now <br />4. She's Got Her Ticket <br />5. Baby Can I Hold You <br />6. Across The Lines <br />7. Behind The Wall(this song is really striking and speaks to the Tracy's unique talent)
B000AA305M|1.0|I recognize many don't appreciate the concept of \\"fair use\\" which is what you are legally entitled to when you purchase music.  I already went through the SunnComm copy protection problems on Santana - All That I Am (a tired re-tread of duets IMHO) and won't repeat that experience with this CD. There are ways to bypass this copy protection but the end result is a very poor quality sound.  You can buy a non-copy protected version from Amazon UK if you want to spend the extra $$.  Remember SONY's first digital portable didn't support MP3 and the reason that this can't port to an iPod is to try to help force Apple to accept SONY's standards.  SONY has always been off on their own in terms of proprietary formats and their own standards.  The artist's themselves don't get to choose, SONY decides where and when to use their copy protection schemes.  DualDisk doesn't work well on my PC and if you look closely you will see a disclaimer on their lables that the formats are not standard CD formats and may not play in some players.  Bad experiences with my last two DualDisks so I won't repeat that either.  So this is a CD I'd love to own and hear but won't.  I won't support a company that forces you to install what is essentially spyware (that reports back your listening habits)to hear their product.  Unfortunate for David Gray.  It's sad more people are not outraged and don't take the time to learn a bit more about what SONY is trying to do.  Their efforts have spawned several lawsuits and I hope it costs them big. If people just accept it, it allows SONY to set the future for people that BUY their music and have an expectation of fair use.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love this album. John Mayer is increadibly talented, some of his music gets dismissed as being too poppy, but i disagree; his songs have great lyrics that you can relate to, and he's a great guitarist. It's a fun yet relaxing album to listen to, and it definitely spent ages on repeat in my cd player. I prefer this album to his 2nd album Heavier Things, my favorite songs on this one include: Why Georgia, My Stupid Mouth, Love Song for No One, Great Indoors, & Your Body Is A Wonderland. I always recommend this album to anyone that's looking for an album that you'll love the whole way through.
0060531053|3.0|There is a wealth of information in this book...as there was in the 2nd Edition.  Some of the recipes, ingredients and beer style information are updated.  But I just cannot get past a feeling that Charlie isn't *really* up on the homebrewing gear that's out there and in common use. <br /> <br />One prime example: the standard immersion wort chiller.  The book's discussion on wort chillers is amazingly devoid of this particular device that probably 75% of homebrewers either use now or have used in the past.  He uses a copper coil chiller to run the *wort* through (surrounded by an ice bath), rather than running cold water through the chiller that is immersed in wort.  Sure, people can use them that way, and doing so is no doubt effedtive.  But it is a distinctly uncommon use, and extremely odd that there isn't any mention of how most people use them. <br /> <br />And wort-handling.  All commonly-accepted information suggests that aerating hot wort is the prime cause of oxidation and off-flavors.  Yet, Charlie has novice brewers dumping their hot wort through a strainer and into a fermenting bucket, with no discussion of chilling the wort first.  This is in the introductory \\"newbie\\" section of the book. <br /> <br />The new charts, and information on cleaners and sanitizers is good and was long overdue.  But for a 3rd Edition, there isn't much here that experienced brewers won't already get out of the 2nd Ed.  As for novice brewers, go ahead and buy it realizing that this isn't the \\"bible\\" that sooo many people used to say about the 2nd Edition.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|If you are not a fan of comic book heroes, you'll still find a lot to like here, including awesome acting, music, special effects, fighting, explosions, etc.  Bale shines as Wayne and the \\"Bat.\\"  So do the other actors, however.<br /><br />The one minor issue that I have is the use of the handycam (I think that is the right word) during the hand fighting scenes.  Directors use this to instill a sense of urgency or to get in really close to the action.  I find it annoying because the trick makes it hard to see the actual action.  Plus, I get dizzy trying to follow everything.  Nolan uses this type of camera a lot during the fight scenes.<br /><br />Other than the use of the handycam, this is a cool movie.  The music is especially haunting.  I am thinking about investing in the soundtrack to this movie as the music is that good.<br /><br />I think this version is closer to what Batman should be.  It is a dark, gritty action movie with gadgets, villains, and heroes.<br /><br />This is an excellent DVD to add to your collection.  I am glad that I picked a copy up for our family.  I hesitate to say that is an instant classic in the genre, but I think it compares favorably to Spiderman and the X-Men, two stellar franchises.<br /><br />I hope DC has learned its lesson.  Nobody wants to see cheese when it comes to superhero movies.
B000AP04EW|2.0|Face it--the only reason this film did so well is that people were gaga over the romantic coupling of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  And while the two stars use their charismatic presence to propel the film, it's a two hour mismash of incoherent plotting and lots of shoot em up action, car chases and etc., etc.  The story revolves around Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a bored suburban couple who have kept the important secret that they both are \\"hit people\\" for rival companies.  When they are set up to do the same hit, they find out their secret and have 48 hours to off each other.  While the premise is unique, its execution is marred by redundancy and no real sense of humor.  It might have worked better if they had gone for a more comical approach to their attempted assassination of each other, but played with a more serious edge, the viewer fails to find any reason to cheer either actor on.  The climax is incredibly incredible and the movie seems to outstay its welcome.  MR. AND MRS. SMITH may appeal to fans of the tabloid titans, but as a movie, it doesn't offer all that much originality.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I never was a religious person. But nevertheless I have to say that \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is something. I can't recall when a movie had such an impact on me. It is simply astounding. Much because of not used nowdays latin and arameic and much more thanks to brilliant and superior (I could give countless epithets) actors, you don't have a feeling of watching a film. You don't have a feeling of watching a documentary. You have a definite feeling that you ARE there. And that happens (to me at least) not often. One of the main effects of the film is that the story-line is well known. You know from the very beginning how it is going to end. So it's interesting and almost unbearable to see how wrong choices were made and how after a chain of decisions dictated either by ignorance or by cowardice or by both the most innocent person ever on our planet was exposed to terrible torture and suffering and then put to death. We see how Judas repents after his betrayal but there's no way back. We see how Pontius Pilate (shown here as a good-natured man) hesitates but then sends Jesus to Golgotha (he might also repent but it's too late). We see all these people and we pity them for they really knew not what they were doing. During the whole film I had this desire to tell them: wake up, don't make this mistake, don't you see you are doing evil? I think all the time - what if everything had happened the other way? But apparently there were no other way because Jesus had predicted everything that'd happen.<br /><br />The movie is really shocking and appalling, and not because of violence and gore. It's the ultimate tragedy of mankind and it is just intolerable to watch it.<br /><br />\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" has one of the best casts I've ever seen in cinema. Jim Caviezel really effuses light, guess he was the perfect candidate for this part. Maia Morgenstern (Maria), Hristo Shopov (Pontius Pilate) and especially Rosalinda Celentano (Satan) look like they were born for these roles. I'm utterly impressed and dazed.<br /><br />If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.<br /><br />Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.<br /><br />And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any. Don't believe all that fuss.I'm utterly impressed and dazed.  <br />If you easily get appalled by screen violence I can say this: try to withstand these two hours, it's the way to feel at least the relish of sufferings Jesus had to withstand.  <br />Whether you are a religious person or not watch this film, it's thought-provoking and serious-minded.  <br />And as of an alleged antisemitism of which the film was accused many times... well, I haven't noticed any.

0393317552|5.0|A book exploring the concepts of why certain geographical areas foster trade more than others. This book offers many fascinating tidbits of scientific interest. I couldn't put this book down ! I disagree with the other reviewers about the author expressing bias. The author makes several clearly stated points throughout the course of the book, against racist, classist misconceptions in biology. I am told by a dear friend who is a psychology major that, \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was required reading (who felt the book was an important experience). The book is enjoyable and stimulating to read, I sincerely recommend it.

0679422714|5.0|This is a far better book than Philip Short's Mao, which is very good itself. It's about time a book told the full truth, in meticulous detail, about this vicious psychopath. Don't be surprised that you'll also find among these reviews the usual slanderous denials. Telling the facts about a depraved dictatorship does not make anyone \\"right-wing,\\" or a \\"puppet\\" of \\"imperialists.\\" One of these reviews was written by an official of the U.S. - China Peoples Friendship Association, which was founded not in the post-Mao era, but during his reign. Why should the U.S. be praised if it tries to be \\"friends\\" with Mao, Stalin, or other such dictators-and then be mercilessly criticized when it assists less deadly right-wing regimes, as in Latin America? The same sort of denials about Stalin's holocaust abounded in his day, slacking off only after the revelations of Khrushchev and Gorbachev that the stories of terror were true after all. Peace is another matter, but what kind of an organization would want to promote \\"friendship\\" with a country like Maoist China? This kind of \\"truth\\" is a sad joke.  <br />  <br />I recently also read The Private Life of Chairman Mao by his personal doctor Li Zhi-Sui. It confirmed many of Mao's statements (see pp. 410-11 of  Mao: The Unknown Story) about not caring if millions died, as well as confirming that Mao had many teenage concubines brought to him-not willingly, either. The doctor's book got 4.5 stars on Amazon. Was he too a liar or a propagandist? A few years ago I read Life and Death in Shanghai by Nien Cheng, which also got 4.5 stars on Amazon. She described the horrors of her treatment and imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution, unleashed by Mao, confirming the Chang-Halliday book's account (pp.514-25). Was she a liar too? Mao's insane orders for peasants to kill sparrows, which caused great biological and ecological damage (pp. 430-31), has been recounted in many other books, as was his \\"Great Leap Forward\\" and its depraved backyard steel furnace idea (pp. 431-32), which impoverished tens of millions of Chinese and helped wreck the Chinese economy. A man who couldn't run a hot dog stand successfully thought he could run an entire economy! The horrible results could have been predicted. <br />  <br />No one disputes that these latter incidents took place. Could the man responsible for them have been a great leader who loved his people and tried to improve their lives? No one denies that Mao revered Stalin and disliked Khrushchev precisely for his \\"revisionism,\\" as Mao: The Unknown Story also points out. It is also nowhere denied that Chinese living standards have improved dramatically in the post-Mao era, after his \\"principles\\" had been abandoned and capitalistic ones restored. So if this book sounds a bit like a diatribe, it's a diatribe about someone who has long deserved to be on the receiving end of one. <br />  <br />As for sources, one of the main sources of information about the Holocaust was the spoken testimony of the victims and their relatives and friends-also something that cannot be easily \\"confirmed.\\" Does that invalidate it, especially when we know that General Eisenhower, General Bradley, General Patton, and many of their troops also saw it for themselves? The testimony of these soldiers' children about what their fathers told them would also be valid, so who's kidding whom about \\"sources\\"? The current Chinese rulers, having become the sort of \\"capitalist roaders\\" that Mao always denounced, have clung to dictatorial power nonetheless, so the usual kind of sources have been suppressed. Here's proof. The same day I wrote this I chanced upon the following news article entitled \\"UN says torture widespread in China, probe obstructed.\\" Here is the URL: <br /> <br />[...]%2F20051202%2F0620000002.htm&sc=aspacnews <br /> <br />The title:  <br />BEIJING (AFP) - A United Nations rights investigator has said that torture was still widespread in China and accused authorities of trying toobstruct his work on a historic 12-day fact-finding mission.  <br /> <br />The first few paragraphs are as follows: <br />\\"Torture is on the decline but it is still widespread,\\" Manfred Nowak, the UN Human Rights Commission's special rapporteur on torture, told a press briefing on Friday at the end of his trip.  <br /> <br />\\"There is much that still needs to be done, there is a need for many more structural reforms.\\"  <br /> <br />Torture methods cited in a press release at the end of his trip included use of electric shock batons, cigarette burns, submersion in pits of water or sewage and exposure to conditions of extreme heat or cold.  <br />Some techniques were apparently so widespread that they had generated a special terminology, such as \\"exhausting an eagle\\", where prisoners are forced to stand on a tall stool and beaten to the point of exhaustion.  <br />Nowak said Chinese authorities had closely monitored and obstructed his work, which included interviews conducted in Beijing as well as in the restive regions of Tibet and Xinjiang.  <br />\\"There were serious incidents of obstructing my mission by the ministries of state and public security,\\" he added.  <br />\\"There was frequent surveillance of my interviews that I had outside prison with victims' family members,\\" Nowak said.  <br /> <br />With this in mind, how else can information about China's dark secrets be obtained except by word-of-mouth from people who are no longer under surveillance? <br /> <br />This is a book that should have a prominent place on the bookshelf of any avid reader who wishes to know the truth about an important part of world history. <br />
B000AMJDHY|5.0|P!ATD is shortly stated, awesome. An album you can rock out to and dance along with at the same time. I don't understand why people are referring to P!ATD as posers just because their vocals are comparable with those of FallOut Boy. While it's a valid statement, P!ATD is almost another genre than FOB considering they are more experimental with their vocals. They aren't just poppy rock, they add attitude. Furthermore, if the music didn't set them apart, the lyrics sure do. They are truly inventive and creative in their writing. Alas, I love P!ATD and I think that anyone with an open mind and an inclination to tap their toes to the beat will love them too. ps-\\"tap tap tap your toes to the beat\\" is a lyric excerpt from their song \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage\\"
3937406328|5.0|The purchase of this set was a bold step for me. I don't own any \\"boxed\\" sets. When I learned of this project on Chris's website I knew that this would be unique. I couldn't wait to explore such an immense piece of art. I'm still exploring. It's breadth is impressive. While I have my favorites there is not a song that is sloppy or rushed. Check back with me and my list of favorites will undoubtedly change. Currently it includes: Blind Willie (Texas Blues disc), My Blue World Says Hello (Electric Memphis Blues disc). As for the DVD... fascinating! I love the creative process that goes into any work of art. This is a little window into Chris's world and the musicians he worked with. <br /> <br />The only downside to this project is that the book which houses the discs and the artwork is poorly designed to hold discs. They fall out very easily. All things considered, it's a minor inconvenience. All the music is now copied onto my computer/IPod.  <br /> <br />I Consider this purchase an investment in my education. Well worth the price.
0385338082|5.0|After reading the shopoholic series I knew I would like this book as well. Sophie Kinsella has a way of writing that reminds me of the way we talk with girlfriends, or even what we don't share with girlfriends. <br /> <br />After meeting a handsome man on a plane and just spilling her guts her little world get turned upside down. At the end of the book I wanted it to be a little longer, I wanted to know what happened next. Maybe a series or a part 2 is needed for one of those weekends I want to spend curled up with a good book!
B000ATQYT2|4.0|I have seen other reviews that ding this film for its inexplicable deletion of a scene...and I am 100% in agreement. <br /> <br />As I watched it, I was really impressed by the sound, the extra details that would have been lost in pan-and-scan, etc. I was in heaven, watching my favorite Christmas movie in its original glory... <br /> <br />And then they cut \\"When Love is Gone\\" it felt like I had been slapped in the face... <br /> <br />Honestly, it's not even my favorite song, but to cut it leaves the movie choppy, and leaves the viewer feeling cheated. Even my 6-year-old noticed noticed it. <br /> <br />So one full star from an otherwise 5-star rating for the unforgivable offense of editing the movie.
B000001Y2U|4.0|although i'm not an anti-christ myself, i really do enjoy this record.  Very catchy. fun to bang your head to with your fist in the air....Very favorite track would have to be \\"Mister Superstar\\" followed by \\"Angel with the Scabbed Wings\\".  Also check out \\"Mechanical Animals\\" & \\" portrait of an American Family\\".  But i do recommend you avoid \\"Smells like Children\\" at all costs..it's an awful f***ing piece of plastic...break that CD if you come in contact with it..seriously...
B000BJS4SU|5.0|So the latest installment is also the debut.  The first release by the John Mayer Trio (John (g,v), Steve Jordan (d), Pino Palladino (b)), \\"Try!\\" was recorded live in concert at the House of Blues in Chicago.  It may seem like an unnatural step for Mayer, but in the truest sense, he has returned to his roots. <br /> <br />From pretty much day one of his pop-stardom, he has promoted the image of smooth-serenading acoustic troubador.  And he did pretty well (I think that 3 Grammy's just told me this is an understatement).  But underneath all that was John's foundation - a baddass electric guitarist.  Influences ranging from Stevie Ray Vaughan to John Coltrane are melded with a fresh sound and serious chops (1 year at Berklee was plenty, apparently) to yield quite possibly the next real guitar hero.  And \\"Try!\\" is the first big step towards that. <br /> <br />The album opens with JM3's first single, the all-too-appropriate query \\"Who Did You Think I Was?\\"  And with it comes the huuuge electric sound (side note: John's rig was recently featured in premier gear-head newsletter The ToneQuest Report [...]  And when the bass and drums enter, it's on.  Three guys crankin' it out right off the bat (and you can definitely see why Steve Jordan played for The Who).  They continue with \\"Good Love is on the Way,\\" a funky original composed collectively by the Trio that recalls the sounds of Grand Funk Railroad and other few-decades-old funksters, and features John quacking out on the wah-wah pedal.  The next track features Hendrix's \\"Wait Until Tomorrow,\\" which has one of the most fiery guitar solos laid down in this decade (Jimi is looking down proudly at his fellow Strat-master).  The solemn \\"Gravity\\" places the well-framed 'John Mayer Ballad' nicely in the new Trio setting, complete with insightful lyrics and a tasty electric guitar solo.  He continues with \\"Vultures,\\" which bridges jazz and 80's pop a la The Police (something the once billed 'Jazz-Pop sensation' has done remarkably well), serving up lines about not conforming and plucking out a funky guitar jam down to the faded-out ending. <br /> <br />Then comes number six, going back to the home of the blues (John teases \\"Fairfield, CT, where the blues was born\\" to the Chicago fans who really know) with \\"Out of my Mind.\\"  And he plays out of his mind.  The slow, classic changes of BB and T-Bone (that's King and Walker, respectively, for those wondering) let John speak his bluesy mind about what music was made for.  And he sings: <br /> <br />I'm putting you, baby  <br />I'm putting you right out of my mind  <br />I'm putting you, baby  <br />I'm putting you right out of my mind  <br />So tired of running after you, girl  <br />And being one and one half steps behind  <br /> <br />Go and tell your friends now  <br />Go tell your friends what Johnny did  <br />Go tell your friends  <br />go tell your friends just what Johnny did  <br />If they don't tell you that you're crazy, baby  <br />Lord, they as messed up as you is  <br />(Lemme play my guitar, people ) <br /> <br />From Ma Rainey to Robert Cray, them blues is the real deal.  And the solo (with influence from Buddy Guy, but amazingly original, especially towards the end), and voice/guitar call-and-response do not disappoint.  The 11-song set now over the hump, the Trio cranks out John's previously written (but unreleased) \\"Another Kind of Green,\\" which keeps John's funky-pop stylings close. <br /> <br />Now the home stretch.  Steve and Pino lay down the beat for John's guitar colors (he describes in another show as \\"icing all over it\\") and breaks out into a funked out \\"I Got a Woman\\" a la Kanye.  Then he plays two of his 'older' ones, \\"Something's Missing\\" followed by \\"Daughters,\\" which are complete with screaming and singing from the younger female contingent that has dominated John's fanbase since the YBIAW video went 'Spanking New' for 10 seconds between episodes in the Real World/Road Rules Challenge #26 Marathon Weekend.  Thesongs are good ones and performed quite well, but almost seem anticlimactic with the craziness unleashed beforehand. <br /> <br />But luckily, it finishes strong with the title track (which serves as the play-on-words which has become part of John's MO).  Before the downbeat, many are yelling out \\"[Play] Comfortable!\\" which would make no sense whatsoever; so appropriately JM3 play the 'anti-comfortable', and totally rock it out.  With the same electric energy that asked the question in the opening track, the Trio comes full circle to answer that THIS is me trying to be myself, when everyone else said it had to be acoustic guitars and 'bubblegum toungues....' <br /> <br />I talk much about John, but he's held up by (and accountable to) the two other guys on the stage.  Steve and Pino are blues-rock veterans with unparalleled curricula vitae.  And they not only feed John the background, they propel with him as a 3-man Tour de Force.  The unit rocks, plain and simple, and it is John keeping up with the other two that shows just how good he really is. <br /> <br />Since he went major-label, I have been waiting for the day that the John I knew, doing the harmonized scat-guitar lines to \\"I Only Like You 'Cause Your Sister's Hot\\" at Cappucino Joe's to an audience you can count on two hands (and over my rhythm guitar - I mean, I couldn't write a JM piece without getting it in there ::smirk::), to come out and show his true colors to the rest of the world.  He always had the live shows, the finger-throbbing backing tracks, and a couple guitar mag covers to remind us that it was in there somewhere.  But this budding guitar hero has finally come to say \\"Oh yeah, I can play.\\"  And it seems that I'm not the only one enjoying it.  The massive response the tour has received is heartwarming, knowing that there are people out there who still enjoy real music from one of the top musicians out on the scene today.  I'm glad it's returned.  Check out [...]'s returned.  Check out www.johnmayertrio.com.
0451191153|5.0|The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand    I arrived at The Fountainhead by reading the books mentioned in the Berkshire Hathaway letter to shareholders by Warren Buffet, one of which was, When Genius Failed about the rise and disastrous collapse of Enron. That mentioned The Fountainhead, which I read first, then Atlas Shrugged. The full book tree is available at my blog (The real estate investors blog at bloglines). The Fountainhead was less focused on the economy and more on the individual and how the group consciousness, collectivism and the expectancy to live ones life for others affects society, whereas Atlas Shrugged takes it a bit deeper to show the effects on an economic level.     Both approaches clearly and convincingly point out the dangers of irrational thoughts, beliefs and actions. Ayn Rand, both in this book and her others rejects the belief that man is or can be a victim of forces beyond his control, such as God, fate, upbringing, genes or economic conditions. She shows through the beliefs and actions of the lead character Howard Roark how rationality is man's basic virtue and his main fundamental values are: reason, purpose and self esteem. She illustrates that man must live for himself, not for anyone else and to live for one self takes self esteem to believe in ones own ideas, dreams and visions.     I applaud her strong burning belief in a hands off Government and laissez-faire capitalism. I read someplace that Alan Greenspan is a big Ayn Rand fan as can be seen by his hands off approach and reluctance to interfere with capital markets and security market regulations.    The book illustrates that thinking for one self is of the utmost importance in life and how not thinking for one self turns you into a helpless victim of the thoughts and plans of others.      The books theme, be true to one self is a biblical concept mixed with a modern day society to illustrate as clear as day the difference between self thinkers and those that live for others. It will just about terrify you into becoming your own person.     By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real Estate     (...)
B000002U82|4.0|Were it not for this Dark Side of the Moon's (DSOM) commercial success, I'd probably having given it five stars...after all, IT IS Pink Floyd.<br /><br />But, DSOM is as much a reflection of Alan Parson's production effort as it is Gilmour's and others' ability.  And, what's up with that?  I learned to love Floyd because it broke with studio production conventions.<br /><br />As for ELECTRONICA production, Parsons is very good, but he is not Floyd.<br /><br />What I like most about this album is that it continues to introduce new generations to a great band.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this album is terrific.  My recommendation is: BUY!
B000AP04NI|1.0|I now have (4) FOUR versions of Oklahoma on DVD as Fox cant get their act together to make a good quality TodAo version of this wonderful film. Those of you who remember how incredible the real TodAo version was, would also agree with me. The C/scope version on this 2 disc DVD is very good but the TodAo version AGAIN is shocking!!! FOX you are ripping us off! This is the second release of the TodAo version on DVD that I know of and now it is MUCH WORSE than your last release! Ive tried to contact FOX throught email but that is IMPOSSIBLE they dont want to know! They again have our money and run all the way to the bank! So I now own (3) versions of the TodAo Oklahoma all BAD and one good C/scope version. Will FOX get my money when they release this film again or not? Im on a campaign to tell as many people as possible, to not buy this version from Fox. The other R&H copies that also are bad that FOX has released in the past is King & I, South Pacific, Carousel & Sound of Music. These great movies were all made in formats that were really something spectacular on the big screen, and Fox is feeding us DVD quality way below PAR! Fox fix these problems once and for all, your driving me crazy! The very best musicals of all time from R&H are completly ruined by Fox. Look at the wonderful quality of old films like Singing in the Rain which were much older than these, some other studios are doing the right thing with their customers. Up the standard please Fox and maybe I will buy these great movies when you have the technical \\"know how\\" to release them on DVD correctly. Murray Thompson NZ.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|...and I'm saying that as a positive thing, not a literal meaning to the term.<br /><br />- REVIEW<br /><br />Hey, you!  Yea, you!  Are you one of those people that seen the previews of \\"Aeon Flux\\" and thinking, \\"Woah!  This movie's so gonna suck; I mean, \\"Catwoman\\" suck\\"?  Well, my unseen random consumer...I cannot blame you: the concept looks awkward, the stunts are glorified, and Theron's costume screams out \\"blech!\\".  My thoughts haven't changed, but within 700 words, my thoughts will render how this 1-star predicted disaster convert into a shocking 3-star entertaining romp.<br /><br />With 1-star on my mind, I have to grasp into the story, which is about as comprehensible as Dubya Bush making his speech.  In about 7 years from now, 99% of the Earth's pop is dead from a virus...possibly from the avian flu.  Those that survived are on scientific notice, and one Trevor Goodchild conducted a cure that will purity the remains...sort of.  All I know is that 400 years into the future, one 'psychedechnical' (Psychedelic meets Technical) city holds the survivors under control of the Goodchild regime, runned by the same guy who cured them 400 years ago (???).  But the rebels against the regime's reign continues to weaking his power, though the territorial rebels are destroying for the good, as the regime are really hostile that often kills certain civilians that might corrupt the nation's premise.  In other words: Government = bad; \\"bad guys\\" = good.  Only one Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), a high-ranked fighter of the rebels, has the strength to take down something as confusing as the regime.<br /><br />So, Ms. Theron here fights the government wearing clothes that ranges from \\"Awful\\" to \\"Not awful like the last one\\", although I doubt Theron would degrade herself to wear the old revealing get-up the original femme fatale wore on the animated show.<br /><br />Anyway, the \\"future\\" remains uncertain, and by uncertain, I mean I have no idea how anything I see in this film work.  How did Aeon's weapons work, how do the futuristic security system function, how is swallowing some pill got Aeon get in touch with the leader of the rebels from her mind, and what are the foods these people are eating?  It seems as though the movie just goes into the future setting without any hint of social explanation.  At least the producers kept the atmosphere in spirit of the original series, along with its intended characters and premise.  And as long as you can tolerate some of the actors goofy one-liners, the characters act well, and Theron is a good Aeon, which is why the star went up a pound.<br /><br />Another pick-er-upper is the fact that the movie has layers, albeit layers done very sloppy.  As Aeon confrots Trevor to assassinate in a vengeful manner, as she should, a revelation occurs when love and secluded past memories affected her way of thinking.  Neither had killed each other, which resulted in a backlash between the regime and rebels.  That's when the good part sets in, as many mysteries of the film (but not all) have been revealved that deals with the past, the search for a cure, and cloning.  Now, she and Trevor alone are on their own mission to find a solution to the nation's problem, while getting away from the regime who not only considered them as fugitives, but so has the rebels who now wants to kill Aeon.<br /><br />\\"Aeon Flux\\" is not so bad, I was really surprised.  The abrupt and incohesive premise should've been dealt with more \\"flux\\"-iblilty, but the fact remains: it's not boring, it had some cool action scenes, and it had a solid story as it progresses.  As long as you don't think of this as Theron's big hit like \\"Monster\\" or \\"North Country\\", this film will give you a decent time.<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying \\"At least it's better than that Tomb Raider film.\\"this film work.

B000002GVO|5.0|I've been listening to this marvel for 29 years. The songs that impassioned me when in college when this came out were \\"Pretty Maids, \\"Wasted Time\\" and \\"Last Resort\\". 29 years later, I turn to these 3 still. Never really dug the \\"hits\\" at that time as radio forced them down our throats....and also because there were terrible local bar bands that tried to emulate \\"Fast Lane\\", which I hated back then for that reason. <br /> <br />\\"New Kid\\" seems very out of place here (as I chronologically grow older...) but this is still, as with the \\"Born To Run\\" collection by Springsteen, an absolute joy to listen to. <br /> <br />Buy it.
B00005JOHI|5.0|The first time I saw the movie trailer for p&p, I thought it would be a fun romantic to go and see. I didn't realize it would be the most romantic movie I have yet to see (from the exception of 'The notebook'). I thought it was beautifully directed, full of wistfullness and anticipation. Keira Knightley has been a favorite of mine for some time, and now I know why. She made an excellent Elizabeth and I felt the warmth for her sisters, the embarrassment  for her mother, and the love for Mr. Darcy. Matthew Macfadyen did a wonderful job of playing the king of romance, Mr. Darcy himself. Never hearing of this actor before, I caught my breath when I first saw him walking to the back of the assembly with Mr. Bingley and his sister, full of resentment for being there and looking down on everyone else, you can't help but be curious about a character as such. Seeing the two fall in love felt like watching something that should be kept private and cherished and to view such a sight felt like an honor. At the end of the movie I cried and smiled and walked out hating men for knowing there will never be anything like a Mr. Darcy or a Mr. Bingley in this lifetime. It is a movie where I went out the next day and bought the book (never having read it before), memorized it, and went and saw the movie again. I can't wait for it to come out on DVD, for I will be one of the first in line. I hope, for today's society sake, on their view of what romance is, and what it ought to be, that everybody go and watch this movie at least once. For I know I have seen it several times since it has hit theaters.
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|This is a pretty handy film. With none of the showmanship of the 1989 Batman, this film is almost workmanlike in the way it builds its story, and yet the overall effect is perhaps the best Batman ever.  <br /> <br />Christian Bale is quietly effective as Bruce Wayne, a likeable and soulful hero, and a truly impressive cast of very famous faces from both America and England give him more than enough support. <br /> <br />But its the story which impresses most. This Batman tale has real depth and only rarely stretches credibility to the point where you are reminded that the film is based on a comic book. It's the story of a man, searching for a means to deal with his own demons and looking for a pathway through life. The script is deft at every turn, making the unfolding plot seem effortless and natural.  <br /> <br />Best of all, it relies on great acting, writing, direction and plot, seemlessly interwoven, rather than special effects to hold your attention. <br /> <br />Without a hint of Hollywood's usual, typical \\"look at me\\" ostentatiousness, Batman Begins may be the most totally watchable and satisfying comic book hero movie I've ever seen.  <br /> <br />Mention simply must be made of Michael Cain's Alfred...the man is classy, and genuinely funny, which stands out in a serious and compelling tale like this one.  <br /> <br />Batman Begins is a film I highly recommend.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album kicks my ass, your ass, and someone else's ass. This is what heavy metal sounded like back then. Alot of people can argue saying, well what about this or that band. Bottom line is that this is the pefect sound of an 80's heavy metal band, aka Metallica. So, basically, this makes me all hyped up. It's a great album. I haven't really given reviews on any other albums, so I'm going to start now.
B00008LOS1|5.0|\\"Who's Next (Deluxe Edition)\\" gives us an in depth retrospective into the making of this seminal album. Pete Townshend and John Atkins discuss at length the original synopsis for the album and a track-by-track analysis in a 27-page booklet. We learn Pete Townshend initially planned a multi-dimensional project with a film, theatre event, double-album, song-cycle and concert performance whereby music becomes the salvation -- the lifehouse, if you will -- for youth living in an oppressive, futuristic  society; it was to be called \\"Lifehouse\\" which he subsequently released in part in 1993 as [[ASIN:B000GFRJ4E Psychoderelict]], then completed in late 1999 as the 6-CD \\"The Lifehouse Chronicles\\".<br /><br />The booklet also contains an alternative \\"Who's Next\\" album cover, showing Keith Moon wearing wig and lingerie, holding a whip in hand. It may have made for cutting-edge surrealism, but the piss-stained megalith on a slag-heap with the guys adjusting their fly is by far the perfect statement of youthful alienation and contempt for the mundane uniformity of the Establishment. Additional photos of the group in the Twickenham studio, in concert at the Young Vic and subsequently the Rainbow are interspersed throughout the booklet.<br /><br />So what's on the CDs of \\"Who's Next: Deluxe Edition\\"?<br />CD 1:<br />* The original tracks of \\"Who's Next\\" were recorded at the Stargroves and Olympic studios. It was produced by Glyn Johns, April-May 1971, using what were rather revolutionary instruments at the time, the VCS3 and ARP synthesizers. Pete Townshend programmed and sequenced these instruments, building for the first time in an album, a synthesiser song cycle. Roger Daltry's voice is in great form, testing the range of his vocal chords. Keith Moon's drumming is supercharged and precise, reminding us of just how great a drummer he was in this era. John Entwistle's tongue-in-cheek \\"My Wife\\" is the only non-Townshend song featured on this album. Nicky Hopkins plays on \\"This Song Is Over\\", a rather complex piece that was never performed live; interestingly, it quotes from the excluded \\"Pure and Easy\\" which was the first song to set the wheels in motion for the \\"Lifehouse\\" project.<br /><br />* Tracks from the first studio recordings were made in New York at the Record Plant with Kit Lambert at the helm, March 1971. The sessions are loose and fractious. The play list is different from the original release. \\"Pure and Easy\\" isn't released until years later, on \\"Odds & Sods\\"; so too is an alternate version of \\"Love Ain't For Keeping\\". Al Kooper plays organ on \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\". The instrumentation and vocal arrangement for \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" is different; an organ is played through a VCS3.<br /><br />CD 2:<br />* Although initial \\"Lifehouse\\" rehearsals were as early as January 1971, recordings taken from the Rolling Stones Mobile during a live concert at the Young Vic Theatre in South London, 26 April 1971 showcase The Who rocking in perfect form. A \\"small handful of unruly sub-teenagers from off the street,\\" to quote Townshend were invited for this \\"audience participation rock\\" project. It was as much an experiment as it was a confidence building session for The Who before they went into the studio to record \\"Who's Next\\". Pete Townshend is heard chatting up the audience at one point. A fight nearly breaks out during the performance of \\"Roadrunner\\" and The Who lose their way momentarily. The first live versions of \\"Love Ain't for Keeping\\", \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\", \\"Getting In Tune\\", \\"Bargain\\", \\"Water\\", \\"Naked Eye\\", \\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are heard. Previous Who standards (\\"Young Man Blues\\" and \\"My Generation\\") and \\"Odds & Sods\\" songs (\\"Too Much of Anything\\" and \\"Time is Passing\\") are performed as well, rounding out part of the then \\"Lifehouse\\" concept.<br /><br />Whether you enjoyed this album when it was released in 1971 or you're hearing it for the first time, you'll appreciate the \\"Who'sNext: Deluxe Edition\\". It sounds just as innovative and energetic as it did then. A GREAT and INGENIOUS album! Thanks for the additional music and insight, Pete.vative and energetic as it did then.

B00062J00S|5.0|This original uncut version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\" shows the entire story of George Bailey {James Stewart} when he was a child and shows everything in the movie, like about his guardian angel Clarence watching flashbacks of George's life, unlike on tv where it's cut short for commercials. Even more wonderful is that it doesn't miss out on a single detail. This has to be one of the most heartwarming christmas films ever made for being a classic. It explains everything there was to ever explain about the story, and it only becomes more excellent late in the movie when George soon discovers what his life is really about after he sees what it would have been like if he didn't exist. Highly recommended for a christmas movie that is perhaps even more heartwarming than even \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" {1947}. 5 out of 5 stars.
B000002UEB|5.0|First, I'll concede that Queensryche is not my favorite band, nor does any single track from Operation:  Mindcrime rank as my favorite song.  However, as a whole this album is my favorite of all time.  Never have I experienced such a start-to-finish demonstration of amazing musicianship and storytelling.  Though don't get caught up in the fact that it's a concept album; the music will do that for you.  The story is amazing and intriguing, and will make you want to listen to it repeatedly until you manage to pick up on all the tangential plotlines, and how they all play together to tell the story.  I've had this album for more years than I can count, but even after all the years I don't consider this an 80's album; rather, it's an exceptional exhibition of lasting music.  If you haven't purchased this album yet, and enjoy solid rock music and great talent, go pick it up.  There's a good chance that it will also rise to the top of your 'favorite album' list as it did mine.  I've managed to catch Queensryche shows three times, and they're as amazing live as they are recorded.  I'll also give high praise for the Livecrime DVD; though I had it on VHS as soon as I could, I bought the new media and just get lost in it every time I push play.  Highly, highly recommended.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|this has always been one of my absolute favorite christmas movies.  it's meant for children but i believe that many adutls love is just as much as kids.  it't funny, sweet, and shows the true meaning of what we should be thankful for on christmas.  this is one christmas movie that gets better and better every time you watch it.  i actually went out and purchased this new anniversary edition today and i hope that many of you who read this will do the same!  it's a christmas treasure to own!

B0000046ZJ|5.0|This was recorded at the tail end of Stan's \\"California period\\" (1953-57), after which he would spend much time in Europe before returning to the States and establishing a base in NYC. His famous Lestorian sound, cool and lyrical, was fully established, and he loved nothing more than (and was better than just about everybody else at) playing the Great American Songbook at medium to medium-up tempos and swinging the daylights out of it.<br /><br />On this CD he joins up with the Oscar Peterson Trio (Peterson (p) Herb Ellis (g) Ray Brown (b), a group that also was no stranger to the Songbook alluded to above. Stan's tone is a tad huskier than usual and deeply melodious. The first tune on the CD (I WANT TO BE HAPPY), which according to matrix numbers looks like it was the last tune recorded, is interesting in the way Peterson inspires his sidekick: taken up-tempo, Getz has the first solo spot, and he's very relaxed and sounding as if he's happy with a good day's work, but knowing they're at the end of the session, no point in sweating it; then Peterson comes on and takes a wailing solo like there's no tomorrow. Getz solos again, but this time he's on fire, inspired by Oscar's take-no-prisoners approach, and lays down his best solo on the CD. That's genius at work, from both men.<br /><br />But there are many highlights on this excellent CD. PENNIES FROM HEAVEN is in a medium groove and is all Getz - very nice. TOUV'S END, based on the chords of SWEET GEORGIA BROWN, is an interesting tune and features an excellent Herb Ellis solo. BRONX BLUES, a slow blues, has a strange tag-on final chorus initiated by Oscar that sounds like he blew the cue to finish where it was supposed to. (The other blues on the CD, BLUES FOR HERKY, is a medium boogie blues, and is not exceptional.) THREE LITTLE WORDS contains a wonderful stop-time chorus by Stan near the end. And Stan's beautiful melodic playing is most obvious on the slow ballad I'M GLAD THERE IS YOU.<br /><br />This CD is a great one for Stan during a period when he was producing some of his greatest work. Not only a must-have CD for Getz (or Peterson) fans, but a welcome addition to anyone's jazz CD library. It will get lots of play time, believe me.a great one for Stan during a period when he was producing some of his greatest work.

B000BBOUU4|3.0|One thing you can always count on when you get a Tim Burton film is that it'll look visually great. Art direction and production design is always top-notch(except for Planet of the Apes where only the costumes looked good). However, some of them seem to be lacking. Planet of the Apes was boring half the time and had an incredibly stupid ending. Sleepy Hollow looked great but it had a dumb storyline and dialogue choices. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory looked great but halfway through I was wondering if there was a point to the craziness.    The most famous chocolate factory in the world is run by reclusive Willy Wonka. One day he announces something surprising: 5 tickets will be inside random chocolate bars. The children who find them gets a tour of the factory. It's been used as a parody for the Slurm Factory in Futurama and the Pawtucket Brewery in Family Guy. This leads them into the factory only each kid ends up receiving a little misfortune until the last one gets something great.    One watches the film and is wowed by the sets and the effects used. If you're into this kind of thing, you'll sure find it inventive. My favorite is the Nut Sorting Room where a group of heavily-trained squirrels end up sorting different nuts and putting them in chutes. Another has Oompa-Loompas(a dimnuitive race Willy hired to work the factory) firing fireworks just for the hell of it.    One problem I had with the film is how basic everything is. Each kid is your typical one-note persona: the spoiled rich girl, the know-it-all punk, the fat boy and so on. And of course Charlie's soooo good and noble we just know he's going to win the big prize by default. Their fates are actually never dealt with once they come out of the factory. It's like \\"okay kid, you're a blue flexible kid, have fun\\" without even returning them to normal. And more than once I asked myself if there's even a plot. 5 kids tour a factory and gets a little snafu. That's it.     In terms of the look, it's easilyone of Tim Burton's most colorful but as a film it's way down there.
B00005JO1P|5.0|At first I considered, Walk The Line, one of the best movies I've ever seen ... not so!  I soon realized the movie was good, with a simple story and then realized that Phoenix made that movie.  He has talent way more than any of the others.  My Parents didn't believe it was Phoenix singing.  At first I questioned the voice too but then realized that Phoenix sounds better than Cash.  Phoenix has more than just acting talent, he's THE real deal.  I am NOT a movie fan what-so-ever!  I consider most of them a waste of money and my time ... NOT SO with Walk The Line.
B000BKJ78U|2.0|little brats who grew up in a fake world, buying fake music (like Britney Spears, and Nsync), watching fake movie stars (like Jennifer lopez, and Lidsey Lohan), and growing up with a fake president (George W. Bush).<br /><br />It's no surprise that this generation is able to tolerate the new \\"fake\\" versions. Not only has this generation been brainwashed to love \\"fake\\", but they also get bored very easily. They cant be happy surfing the net, unless they are talking on their instant messenger. They cant be happy taking a walk down the street, unless they are talking on the cell phone. Im sure the original version of star wars must seem very boring to a generation raised on Barney the Dinosaur. That's why Lucas added Barney (A.K.A. Jar, Jar, Binks) to his films.
0393317552|4.0|Many people giving this book negative reviews are missing the point when they are criticizing Diamond's central theory: that Europeans developed more sophisticated technology and a distinct advantage over other world cultures because of their environment. In particular, reviewers are asking the question, \\"What about culture, and race, didn't they have a Huge influence on European development too?\\" Well, the reviewers are right about culture. European culture gave Europeans an advantage over cultures of the New World.However, one should know that culture is an adaptation. Culture is heavily shaped by a population's environment, meaning that cultural advantages can be explained by environmental differences or advantages between ethnic groups. So the reason Europeans were more adept at metalurgy was the because they had practice, because they had been specializing in that mode of life for a while. Their cultural adaptation, a result of the environment they lived in, gave them a great advantage over Native Americans. As for race, the minor genotypic differences between ethnic groups (a term that means cultural groups, not race) have been debunked as sources of superiority for populations.
0553801503|4.0|martin is one who loves to write and the beauty is that he writes well. sure 700 pages in not-so-big print seems a bit <br />wordy at a time where brevity is almost Godliness but... honestly, i wouldn't know what to cut.  <br />after waiting for feast for crows for almost two years, i devoured the book in roughly a day. and God i feel like killing cersei. i've never felt the urge to inflict a character so much pain... and that is one reason among many why george rr martin is simply at the top of his game. the reason this book didnt get a 5 was because it was cut in half. since i cant quite stalk mr. martin and tell him to hurry up and finish the book, i'll make myself feel better by knocking down a star. but to be honest, every single book in the series deserves nothing less than 5.  <br />to those who are dipping their toes into fantasy, educate yourself early with a song of ice and fire. its got all that makes fantasy great: a crazy plot, brutally real characters, great lines and lots of humor everywhere. this one's gonna be a classic and you're gonna be proud when you see your little kids read it because you get to go, \\"God I finished that one ages ago.\\"  <br />i hope to God they dont make this one into a hollywood quadrupology or whatever.
0895260131|5.0|This book is very well researched, and I commend both Amazon for having the courage to sell this book. It is sad that both Tony Blair and George Bush feel themselves unable to speak the truth about Islam. Whereever you find Islam, you will find conflict, death, accusations, protestations of victimhood, and terror plots. It has been reported that when George Bush first saw the video footage of the planes crashing into the WTC, and the WTC exploding in flames, he immediately said, \\"It (ie: Islam) is all about Peace, it is all about World Peace.\\" And similarly, when Tony Blair heard that Islamic bombs had gone off in London, the very first words he uttered were, \\"It is a Religion of Peace.\\" If Adolf Hitler reincarnated today, he should surely adopt Islam as his party philosophy. Robert Spenser is one of the few individuals willing to speak the truth publically, and hence he must maintain a secret abode, because Islamists everywhere hate him.
0060764899|5.0|C.S. Lewis really did a great job in creating a world known as Narnia.  A little background on Narnia:  Narnia is a place stuck in a winter that is never ending, it is \\"ruled\\" by the White Witch.  There is only winter and no Christmas.  There are many, many creatures in the land of Narnia.<br /><br />The book starts when 4 kids are shipped to a professors mansion during the times of WWII.  They are told not to disturb the professor.  They pretty much have the huge house to themselves, so there is much mischief that they can get into.  Well Lucy, the youngest of the 4 one day stumbles upon a wardrobe.  She enters into it, but there is not a back to the wardrobe and it leads to Narnia.  She meets a creature called a Faun.  He is actually a creature that is supposed to be telling the White Witch that a human entered Narnia.<br /><br />She gets back and her brothers and sisters don't believe her.  Nevertheless later in the book they all end up in Narnia, and are stunned that Lucy had been telling the truth the whole time.<br /><br />The meet many creatures along the way.  They meet with a Beaver and his wife and they are told of the White Witch, Aslan (a lion who the White Witch fears), and the prophecy that they would be fulfilling.<br /><br />Well one of the four, Edmund takes off after the White Witches palace, because they had meet before and she gave him something to eat.<br /><br />Aslan ends up putting down his life for Edmund after he supposedly betrays the White Witch.  This is a parallel to Jesus Christ.  Many other Christian thems take place after this, and I don't want to reveal them for they are amazing.<br /><br />Note that this book is highly recommended by me.  It has a ton of Christian themes, and it takes you to a fantasy land that is amazing to me. You should definitely get this book, it's for all ages!
B000803PKY|5.0|This is a DVD AUDIO release so don't make the mistake of expecting to see video footage like an earlier reviewer did.  DVD Audio is all about the sound - much higher resolution than CD plus a choice between stereo or 5.1 surround.  If you've got a DVD-Audio player and you're a Jackson Browne fan, consider this purchase essential.  The 5.1 surround mix is like hearing the album for the first time.  Consider the still images a bonus but buy it for the music.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|First of all, buy this ORIGINAL 2001 release version DVD.  Forget the director's cut - it's okay, but not what you'd expect.  The director's cut suffers from what Jack White (of the seminal music band, \\"The White Stripes\\") meant when he said, \\"Art is knowing WHEN to stop.\\"  The director's cut simply doesn't, and you'll see why too if (as I did) you make the mistake of shelling out the extra green to acquire it.  Take my advice:  Don't. <br /> <br />Stick with the original.  You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Okay, why do I call this bizarre, brilliant flick \\"the story of my life.\\"  Well, because on October 20, 1988 (to be exact), I had an experience MUCH like Donnie's, REALLY and TRULY, only in my case I tried to commit suicide.  So when I saw \\"Donnie Darko,\\" my first reaction was, \\"oh my god, HOW did the director know?\\" (about my life at that precise moment in my, much like Donnie's, \\"emotional problems\\"-riddled history?).  So ... overcoming the intial \\"shock/epiphany\\" of seeing my own life played back for me in panoramic technicolor, I curled up, frightened but fascinated, beneath a snuggle blanket and watched further, transfixed by one of the most subtly original, germane, cohesive stories to reach celluloid actualization since \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" or, much more recently, \\"Identity\\" (with John Cusack); and I quickly became, not only a believer in time travel, but a living survivor of it (UNLIKE Donnie, but forgive me for (possibly) giving away TOO much here).  This story HAS to be experienced; and perhaps YOU, Constant Viewer, like I do, remember where YOU were - and what YOU were doing/feeling/going through - way back in October of 1988.  Whatever it was, I bet it was something you'll never forget. <br /> <br />Like this film - you'll never forget it; and, lessee ... I'm on about my, er ... 12th or 13th viewing of it now (the ORIGINAL, NOT the director's \\"clutter\\").  I put \\"Donnie Darko\\" in my Top 5 movies of all time.  For originality, for story, for great,natural, completely successful \\"suspension of disbelief\\" acting; for being, at once - a tragicomedy, a WILDLY-WEIRD (this is the understatement of the new millennium) dramedy, a fired-up, mind-frying sci/fi thriller, a uniquely-tender-hearted horror yarn, and WAY beyond, My Friends:  \\"Donnie\\" is a philosophical brain burster much in the same neogenre/league-of-its-own film-making; for counterparts in creative \\"playfulness\\" behind the motion-picture camera, I can only recommend the following \\"warmup\\" exercises:  see \\"Pi,\\" \\"Primer,\\" \\"Adaptation,\\" \\"Happiness,\\" \\"Prince of Darkness,\\" \\"Being John Malkovich\\" and \\"Martin\\" (a little-remembered but unforgettable piece by George A. Romero, who has a brilliant little cameo in this pic as a \\"happy marshmallow man-child\\" of a Catholic priest).  You'll get the idea FAST, of what you're in for with Donnie. <br /> <br />An all-star cast will blow you away and lends immense credulity to this quirkified, whacked-out, indie knockout punch; you'll be reeling when you see here:  Mary McDonnell, Noah Wiley, Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore!  Watching Drew play the part of a high-school English teacher is definitely worth \\"the price of emotion\\" enough (interestingly, if NOT for Barrymore's bankroll (she's the executive producer of Darko's \\"reel world,\\" in REAL life); fact: \\"Darko\\" probably never would have lit up our darkened screens at all, without Barrymore's vision and deep enough pockets to realize such - Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, Drew!).  And getting Swayze to play the role of a pedophile HAD to have been a \\"challenge,\\" er ... to say the LEAST!  Swayze HAD to have been \\"a total sport\\" about what he was asked to portray; like the way John Malkovich was concerning HIS OWN \\"journey through the looking portal.\\" <br /> <br />But enough said.  Darken your own personal viewing room now.  Slide \\"Donnie\\" into your DVD player.  And \\"take the trip,\\" safely and securely (yet be warned - your MIND and SPIRIT may NEVER be the same afterwards),as I have, and am living proof of, the reality, horror, and (as Kelly intended, and successfully realized), the HEALING benefits, not unlike \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" but only MUCH DARKER implications of, \\"time travel.\\"  Hurry though.  As Kelly remonstrates cinematically, \\"time is precious.\\"  Indeed.  And, Frankly speaking (pun intended), time's running out.
B00000294R|4.0|Big L has incredible talent. He is up there with Ice Cube and Eazy E skillwise. He just has no production. Songs like \\"Da Graveyard\\" would be a classic. If Big L were signed to Bad Boy or Rockafella, he'd be one of the best rappers ever.MVP is a classic. The best produced song on the album. <br /> <br />I reccomend \\"Lifestyles ov tha Poor & Dangerous\\" to you if you like lyrisists and classic hip hop. <br /> <br />I don't reccomend this to you if you are into 50 Cent, Young Jeezy, Ludacris, and those rappers.
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Tom Selleck plays a grizzled, hard-drinking Police Chief in a small Massachusetts coastal burg that is experiencing a series of related killings, all committed with two .22 caliber firearms.  It doesn't take long for him to identify two suspects, but the killings continue as he searchs for enough evidence to bring them in.  I won't give away the films ending except to say that it is very satisfying.<br /><br />Selleck's main problem has always been his somewhat high-pitched voice which doesn't match his brawn. It was fine when he played Thomas Magnum but has worked less well for more serious roles.  Here, Selleck is perfect as he manages to make his voice gruff and deep.<br /><br />One of the films noteworthy flaws is the fact that, despite the alleged Massachusetts setting, there is not a single character with a Massachusetts accent.  And there seems to be way too many Canadian accents for Massachusetts.
B0002EXH54|5.0|The inspiration on this album is more relevant today than when it was released in 1986.  Mustaine is often underlooked as a songwriter and even dare I say political analyst?  Anyone who is familiar with late 80's early 90's MTV will remember his views and opinions regarding anything from his hatred for Metallica to The Gulf War.  As we venture towards the end of the second Iraqi crisis Dave's words ring strong in my head.  Peace Sells.. But Who's Buying... Iraq? Sadly it doesn't seem to be the case.  \\"If their's a new way, I'll be the first in line.\\" I long for a new way myself and would be right behind him loud and proud.  These lyrics are timeless.  If he ever lyrically nailed a song on the head he did it with the title track on this album, and that's just one of the eight ass kicking songs.      1. \\"Wake up Dead\\" is a killer opening track.  It starts out with Dave telling a story regarding an adulteress affair one might have, and the certain doom this person will encounter if he wakes his sleeping partner at 4am when he gets home.  The rest of the song is an instrumental, and a damn good one at that.  With tempo changes, mind blowing solos and melodic swings this track seems like 3 songs in one leading up to the \\"Wake Up Dead!\\" chant at the end.    2. \\"Conjuring\\" keeps the energy flowing with a dark almost \\"trippy\\" solo/fill intro.  The tune gradually picks up speed and agressivelly comes out to being one of the better songs on the album.          3. \\"Peace Sells... Brilliant, Aside from the afore mentioned statement this is one of Dave's most popular songs and a live staple of a Megadeth encore.  This is in my opinion Megadeth's greatest song.    4. \\"Devil's Island\\" Inspired by John Hagee's novel, this song tells an apocalyptic tale to the tune of a descending chug of riffs.  Great riffage throughout, I love the intro when the power chords meet the tapping solo    5. \\"Good Mourning / Black Friday\\" - My God, where do I start with this one!  The vocals on this track don't come in for about two minutes.  After first hearing this you may wonder where the hell could Dave progress to after the vicious multi-part onslaught that he just treated your ears to.  Of course he finds a way to do it, and do it he does indeed.  This song is like a multi-part rock opera that should take an hour but is sped up to the ball busting pulse of 6 1/2 minutes.  It takes several listens to fully grasp this one.    6. \\"Bad Omen\\" Similar to Conjuring (track 2) This is a dark minor scale based song that starts out dark and slow and builds to a all out thrashball. Cool song    7. \\"I Ain't Superstitious\\" Short, cool riffs, nothing to special I usually skip over this one.     8. \\"My Last Words\\" Killer, Starts out with a clean (finger-picked?) riff and busts into, yes believe it or not an all out thrash metal attack.  Great way to close out an incredible album.    Megadeth rules, as for the remastering in question.. I say go for the remastered version, I've heard both, and the newer one is still incredibly raw it just has better production. Worth it for sure. Later
B000BJS4OY|1.0|Hmm, rate the music, not the product?  But the two are inseparable.  Of course Springsteen is great, but now that we know Sony and BMG are implanting spyware with their CDs (on the news last week - Nov. 2005), it's best to check with someone you know who has the CD before buying.  Make sure the product you buy is not infected.  And, if you want to protect your digital rights, don't buy from Sony/BMG at all.  Everything Bruce put out can be found on computer-safe discs.<br /><br />Too bad.  Bruce Springsteen is great.  His work deserves better.
0553804367|4.0|I greatly enjoyed this newer edition of Hawking's classic, and was impressed with how clear the writing was.  The illustrations were beautiful as well.  The sections on Aristotle, Newton, and the expanding universe were breathtaking.<br /><br />However, the explanations of string theory and Richard Feynman's theories of particles and antiparticles were a bit murky for the layperson and needed more explanation.<br /><br />While admirable, Hawking's attempt to find a \\"unified theory of everything\\" strikes me as a bit arrogant and absurd, especially as science and philosophy are both becoming much more specialized.  As Hawking notes, Wittgenstein, reduced philosophy to mere questions of language.  Yes, I know, they poo-poohed man's attempts to fly and to land a man on the moon, but Hawking's desire, though admirable, to know \\"the mind of God\\" through a unified theory of science seems silly.<br /><br />Why can't we, as Iris Dement says, \\"let the mystery be\\"?
B00005JOHI|5.0|I must confess--I went into the theater to see this film with so many preconceptions that nothing short of a miracle would get me to enjoy it. An avid fan of the BBC miniseries, absolutely everything was wrong with the movie. Darcy was too moody, Lady Catherine was much too autocratic, and Wickham was entirely to handsome.<br /><br />Whether it was being compared to Colin Firth or just how much he brooded, I disliked Matthew Macfayden passionately. Yet as the movie progressed, I grew more and more amenable toward him until, like Lizzy, I was in love. It was the same with Wickham--here was a boy who was extremely cute (even knowing the evil he would become) and, at one point, I started hoping they would alter the ending just to avoid this unlikeable Darcy. And who can play a better matron than Judi Dench? Why, she made all other Lady Catherines positively frail in comparison.<br /><br />In fact, the only characters I even remotely liked were Lizzy, Jane and Mr. Bennet. I've always been a Knightly fan, but here, she seemed to personify my idea of Lizzy (though at the time, I was still determined to hate her). When Mr. Bennet first appeared on the screen, I couldn't resist his wry quips and his face when he said them. And though it pained me to admit it, this Jane was much prettier and much more how I'd imagined her than the BBC.<br /><br />When I watched my treasured BBC DVD again a few days afterwards, I was surprised and aghast to see how slow moving and almost -dull- it was. The movie didn't leave out any major scenes or characters (with the exception of the married Bingley sister, who was never that essential anyway) and was over in 2 hours. The \\"teacup time\\" they cut (scenes where someone is looking out a window, or a sudden zoom on a period-teacup) was not missed.<br /><br />The shots in the movie were simply stunning--the lighting effects and the sheer beauty of the landscape made me catch my breath several times, and the picture-perfect world of the BBC was cast aside for the more realistic mud and rocks. While the BBC did a better job capturing the embarrassment of the family, this movie did a better job capturing the differences in status.<br /><br />As much as it pains me to admit it, I believe the movie is better. The preconceptions from the BBC only served to increase my love of this movie, for I felt exactly as Lizzy must have, meeting these characters for the first time. Set against the gorgeous backgrounds and alongside the period music, it was simply inevitable that I would fall in love. The three other BBC aficionados I went to see it with all needed to wipe a tear away at the end (And while I'm not admitting I cried, the tissues in my purse tell a different story) and the four of us went back to see it a few days later. This is a stunning rendition of Pride and Prejudice and undoubtedly my favorite. *swoon*BBC was cast aside for the more realistic mud and rocks.

B000A6CLL0|4.0|Season three is mostly dominated by the xiandi threat to earth. As time goes on it's is made clearer that the xiandi believe the earth is a threat to because a species from trans dimensional space that helped the xiandi out after they almost nearly destroyed themselves is saying the earthlings are a threat to them because in the future the xiandi, starfleet, and others will become allied to stop the trans dimensional space beings because the orbs they have deployed are actually transfoming regions of space into their dominion and making it unihabitable for regular beings to live in that space.The guy from starfllet in the future makes clear to John Archer that he must somehow convince the xiandi to see that this is the case. It isn't an easy task for Archer to so especially with the xiandi reptilians and insects ceatures. It goes into the fourth season with the xiandi problem still unsolved.
0684830515|3.0|After 30 odd years I reread this and it was a whole new book and a frighteningly realistic one. More so then when I read it as a young man. Now, it is a sad and pathetic story about a bunch of drunks where not a page goes by that they are not having a drink, going to get a drink, or leaving the place where they just finished a drink. Without intending to, but with an innate, brutal honesty, Hemmingway describes the shrinking lives and fates of alcoholics.
0345457684|5.0|Altered Carbon had me hooked from the beginning, with me first seeing the book at a library under the Science Fiction category. After reading the summary at the back, I could not resist as to signing out the book. I read it in 4 hours, straight, since I am a fast reader. Nonetheless, the book had me hooked from the beginning and I could not put it down until I had finished it. Morgan paints a world with descriptive adjectives, and slowly leaks us high-tech inventions while seamlessly showing that this kind of technology is not considered too high-tech. Sleek, believable weapons and firefights are a good addition, with a great storyline with lots of twists and sudden revelations. Flashbacks are also a nice touch to the story, and it makes us curious as to the main character's history. More believable things in the future such as religion is also carefully incorporated. <br />In conclusion, Altered Carbon is a very good book, and I believe Richard Morgan may become a legend in Sci-Fi books soon enough.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie. I just want to say to the person who says it's for older people.... my friends and I are 15-17 and we LOVE IT. Infact, my whole grade loves it. We live in Australia and the plain geekiness and lameness of Kip and Napolean is HILARIOUS! I agree those around 10-12 might not get it. My parents who are in their 50s don't get it. I showed funny parts to my Dad and whilst I was cracking up into a fit of giggles he stood there and watched me. How can one not get it!?! GOSH! <br /> <br />My whole grade says quotes from this movie all the time. So for those who haven't seen it .... you need to see it! It's such a claaaassic movvie. <br /> <br />Okay now I sound like an over-excitable teen but I am normally harsh on movies but these strange, independant films always have the best humour. My sense of humour is usually steered towards more british things but I must say this is the best comedy to come from America in ages! <br /> <br />5 stars! <br /> <br />\\"I love the way you sandy hair....floats in the air....to me it's like a lullaby....I'm floating by....oh so high....like a kite\\" - Kip <br /> <br />ND: Stay home and eat all the freakin' chips, Kip! <br />KD: Napolean, don't be jealous that I've been chattin online with babes, all day.

6305511055|5.0|In \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" Robert Redford plays Joseph Turner a CIA analyst who spends his days reading books trying to spot possible operations that the CIA who tries reads books trying to spot covert operations. When the rest of his unit is assassinated, Turner code named Condor goes on the run. He's not sure if the CIA is trying to kill him or some other organization. To escape he kidnaps Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway)a woman who is renting skis for a vacation. Somehow Turner has to discover why his group was killed whether or not he can trust the deputy director (Cliff Robinson)of the CIA to bring him in and avoid the assassin (Max von Sydow)hired to eliminate the last member of the unit.<br /><br />A riveting thriller with geat direction by film veteran Sidney Pollack (\\"Tootsie\\", \\"The Interpreter\\"), \\"Condor\\" has lost none of its power more than twenty years on. Although Paramount is stingy with extras (they usually are)giving us only the film and the theatrical trailer. The film looks pretty nice but could do with a commentary track from Pollack and a look back at this classic movie.
B0002XVQNU|3.0|I never had a problem with the theatrical version of Daredevil, though I did think it was a shallow in places. The story was a bit rushed and the supporting characters were, well, you wondered why they were even in the movie at all. They didn't do anything. That being said, the Daredevil: Director's Cut remedies all these problems. The story, while still no work of art, is much deeper and interesting than the theatrical, taking the focus off superhero action and bringing it back to Matt Murdock, how he fights crime not only as Daredevil but as an attorney who stands up for the little guy. Those wasted supporting characters now contribute to the story. All those things that just happened for no reason, now we see the reason. There's a lot of things going on in this movie, which all feel a bit random at first, but they all tie together nicely in the end. As for extras, there's not much here. A documentary explaining the changes that were made and why they happened and a commentary by the Director and ever grating, Producer Avi Arad, who always comes off like a corporate hype machine, a man who can speak many words, yet say absolutely nothing.
B000005JAX|5.0|Gore released this solo project at what I consider to be the height of DM's darkest and most creative period.  Hearing Gore's depressed and morbid versions of these songs will give you more than a clue to where DM's darkness came from.  Motherless Child is the standout track on this album, but all the rest are also excellent.  The only problem is that obviously there aren't many songs on here, so the album is short.  I'd liked to have heard more, but it is well worth purchasing because every song is very good.  Must have for DM fans of the Music For The Masses/Black Celebration era.
1590581814|3.0|Although I am not a noir fan, I appreciated Sallis' writing skill and ability to create a tight, action-oriented scene.  It skips around in time, but not so that I was lost.  However, I read for character development and interaction, so this book didn't appeal to me as much.  The character is intriguing; he just wasn't fleshed out enough to be truly satisfying for me.  I do think the true noir lover would enjoy this book.
B000BTJCRM|4.0|Well the highly anticipated, mega-hyped album has been released and had time to settle into the ears of the Australian public. There are some epic tracks on the self-titled album - my personal favourites being \\"White Unicorn\\", \\"Pyramid\\", \\"Joker and the Theif\\" and \\"Dimesion\\" - all deliciously big with lots of sludgy, distorted bass and hammering drum solos. The Black Sabbath/Zepplin comparisons have been thrown about for obvious reasons. There is also hints of The Doors, The White Stripes (those shaky vocals) and The Vines. <br />I had to deduct a point for 2 reasons, the first being how hilarious I personally found the lyrics (sure they fit the psycadelic rock genre/er - but really!!!) and the other is reason is I felt that a couple of the tracks were underdeveloped/produced.  <br />Full credit to the Sydney-trio though, they've taken from their influences and done a bloody good job of it!  <br /> <br />An epic album and definately a contender for Album of the Year!  <br /> <br />SIDE NOTE: One can only wonder though how the trio can follow up an album like this without making the retro sound recycled??? I eagerly await their 2nd album
B00005JNJV|4.0|Definitely a good movie, Batman Begins, brings to the screen exactly what the title indicates: the story of Bruce Wayne's transformation into Batman. <br />On the positive side: a) The WONDERFUL cast which includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Rutger Hauer, Morgan Freeman, and Ken Watanabe among others, who have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  Consequently, they have done a superb job of providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.  b) The movie is action packed, while the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the costumes, the special effects, and the battle sequences are all excellent. c) The film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch! <br />On the negative side: a) The district attorney (Katie Holmes) looks like she is sixteen and Crane like he's seventeen.  The young actress was a rather poor choice as this movie does not seem to be her thing, while the teenage-looking doctor overdoes it with his character's weird \\"attitude.\\" Consequently, the actors were not convincing in their respective roles, b) The choice of having the League of Shadows being the \\"villains\\" was not the best.  They do fight evil after all, unless of course there is a not-so-hidden message of frowning upon vigilantes.  Personally I believe that Neeson's words of \\"Crime cannot be tolerated.  Criminals thrive on the indulgence of society's understanding\\" ring true, c) The mention of the Underground Railroad for no other reason than political correctness, which has no place here. <br />In conclusion, Batman Begins is a movie definitely worth watching as it is guaranteed to provide for an evening's entertainment. <br />

B000BB1MHS|4.0|Pretty impressive acting by Johnny Depp - he was weird as he was supposed to be.  The children in the movie are annoying but were so in the Gene Wilder movie.  I think I lean towards the Willy Wonka movie but what I really liked about this movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was how they took the movie a different direction and showed Willy Wonka's chilhood and why he came to own a chocolate factory and how he found the oompa loompas.  I would have to say that there were some things I liked better in the Gene Wilder movie but some that I liked better in the Johnny Depp.  To each their own.
B000BGH22W|3.0|After hearing the soundtrack and seeing \\"Goblet of Fire\\", I found myself with a sense of disappointment.   Not to say that Doyle's work is bad, it just wasn't as effective as William's.  <br /> <br />I was a really big fan of \\"The Prisoner of Azkaban\\" Soundtrack,  and was really expecting big things out of this soundtrack.  This just wasn't it.  <br /> <br />I did find some of the tracks to really work.  I really enjoyed the track \\" the death of Cedric\\"  I nearly cried during that part of the movie,  and I find myself feeling the same way when listening to that track.  \\"Voldemort\\"  is an amazing song,  errie and dark,  until the light at the end of the song ( when the ghosts help him escape)   I also find \\"Neville's Waltz\\"  to be very charming.  I enjoyed the music that plays during the introductions for the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup,  which also plays when Durmstrang enters Hogwarts.  <br /> <br />Other then that,  I was disappointed.  If Doyle stays on for \\"Order of the Phoenix\\",  I hope he does a better job overall,  since he did do some things right in this sountrack.
B0006399FS|5.0|Contrary to what other perennially unsatisfied reviewers have written here, this album is on par with the best that U2 has ever produced, and testifies to their continued status as one of the best rock and roll bands of all time.  One does not need any previous experience with this band to realize that the opening track is one of the rawest, most earnest, and passionate hard rock songs ever written.  When I first listened to the album with my 10 year old son driving along in the car, we decided to rate each song on a scale from 1 to 10.  The first track was a clear 10 but our scores declined as the tracks progressed.  We listened through the album later on the same drive and started to see our scores climbing up, with no tracks falling below 7 or 8 and most hovering around 9.  Yes, there are some soft spots on the album, but I never regret listening through the songs that I supposedly like less--I rarely find myself skipping a song to get on to one I like better. <br /> <br />There is absolutely no way on God's Green Earth that this album merits anything less than a 9 out of 10.  U2 is still setting standards that few bands could ever hope to meet.  When you compare this recent effort to the drivel the Stones were putting out at the same stage of their long career, you can see that U2's staying power is truly remarkable, if not unparalleled in rock and roll history.
B00004T9UF|5.0|SOFTMORE ALBUM IS GREAT,YEAH THIS IS MY FAVORITE ALBUM!!!
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul McCartney's 1997 release, Flaming Pie, is one of the albums that I cherish. I played it on my CD player this morning after 3 or 4 years of it collecting dust and remembered how fascinating a number of songs were that I felt encouraged to sit down and write a review.    Paul introduces the album as a matter of occasion, that how recording the Beatles' Anthology series reminded him of the pleasure and fun of making music which led him to the recording studio to make an album, exactly how The Beatles used to do it. And just like Paul states, the fun is sensed on the album.    Flaming Pie opens up with The Song We Were Singing, a beautifully written accoustic ballad that blatantly refers to The Beatles' days. Somedays is most likely a sequel to Paul's thread of songs that have the word 'day' in their title (Yesterday, Another Day), the song is also one of the highlights on the album with its melodic guitar work and tearjerking lyrics. Paul also proves that he's still got plenty of melody left in him after all these years, just listen to the heavy-riffed The World Tonight, the awesome accoustic work on Little Willow and Calico Skies, the catchy Beatles-influenced Young Boy, the subtle poppiness of If You Wanna, the bluesy rock vibe of Used To Be Bad, which features Steve Miller on guitar, and the epical nature of Beautiful Night, an outstanding song that is undeniably pleasing to the ears, that features Ringo Starr on drums throughout and vocals near the end of the song.    Flaming pie is a fun album, and most definitely Paul's most listenable album since his glory years in the 70's. Although the album does have its shortcomings, take for instance Souvenir, Great Day, and Heaven On A Sunday, which features Paul's son James on guitar, it shows that he can always come back to the songs he was singing to treat us with something hot like the Flaming Pie he delivers here!    Track picks:    The Song We Were Singing  The World Tonight  Somedays  Young Boy  Little WillowBeautiful Night    Recommended    B+
B0000C8AVR|5.0|I love this album. This album has the songs \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"Tombstone Blues\\", \\"It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry\\", \\"From A Buick 6\\", \\"Ballad Of A Thin Man\\", \\"Queen Jane Approximetly\\", \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\", \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\", and \\"Desolation Row\\". All of these songs are classics. Bob Dylan's best album throughout his entire career and the best folk album of all time. If you don't buy it, you are insane.
B00005JO1P|5.0|MOVIE: James Mangold takes us into the formulaic yet satisfying life of the great Johnny Cash. Like all biopics, we have the protagonist who has had a troubled past and overcomes his inner demons to finally get his life back on track. It's pretty much the same senerio for every musical artist. Joaquin Phoenix gives one helluva performance as Cash, and he does it with his eyes. During the musical scenes when Pheonix is performing, you can't help but just stare into his eyes that give off the emotional state that he is singing in. The film is told as a flashback, and we start in Cash's childhood where he suffers the loss of his brother in a tragic accident. His father screams out loud that the devil took the wrong son, and that fuels the troubled past that haunts Cash as an adult. We've all heard the story before, whether it be Cash's story or any other singer/songwriter's. He gets his big break and makes a record, starts touring, falls in love with the lovely Reese Witherspoon who playes June Carter to perfection, uses drugs and alcohol to ease the pain of his past, conquers his problems, and comes to accept life and starts to live it. While it may seem formulaic, the film itself is a fascinating and emotional watch. It's very much like this year's Cinerella Man, a film that is totally formulaic but still brilliantly executed. Mangold, while he has no visual style, does provide a consistent direction for the film that doesn't lose the focus of the audience. The musical scenes are breathtaking and it's all thanks to the brilliant acting. What is even more impressive is that no V/O work was done. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all their own singing, which always adds to the authenticity. The film is a great experience for movie goers, and you'll probably find yourself with a few Johnny Cash tunes on your ipod afterwards.<br /><br />ACTING: Oscar nods for both Phoenix and Witherspoon are going to happen, the performances were absolutly stunning and just incredibly amazing, did I mention the acting was good? Phoenix won't win the Oscar for this one though, I just don't see the Academy giving it to Foxx for Ray last year and now for another musical biopic. Golden Globe? Definately not out of the question.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A story we've all heard before, but it always feels fresh when it's done well. In this case it was done extremely well, the movie was great.ng, did I mention the acting was good?

B00005JNEI|5.0|with all the proof in this greatly made documentary,video proof,and still the american people are undecided?! how pathetic and depressing it is.when bush was reelected i fell into a deep depression and wanted out.eventually i ate some candy and felt somewhat better and stayed.i really believed that this and michael moore WOULD make a difference.and maybe he did,but unfortunately not enough.and that isat no fault to moore,at all.fox news,who elected bush in the first place,is definitely partly to blame.need more proof than what this doc. has to offer,than i suggest watching outfoxed:rupert murdoch's war on journalism.need even more proof on what REALLY happened on 9-11 and who was REALLY responsible,than watch alex jones' 9-11:the road to tyranny.never before has this country been so divided,between liberals and conservatives.guess it's safe to say that this is the divided generation.as long as there is people like bill o'reilly and fox news bullies,there will always be a great divide. and how sad that is.nowadays you can have all the proof that you will ever need,but get a bill o'reilly to say different or the president and his speech writers/communicays,and you can get people to believe anything.hell the tv itself is almost nothing but mind control.aside from my rant this is a great doc. and should be taken seriously.guess you'll always have those who don't care as long as they have there video games and gadgets to make fun because michael moore is overweight.this is a definite doc. to own and watch over and over again to remember what is really true about what is STILL going on today.lies upon lies thrust into the american people by those who we are supposed to trust and depend upon.maybe one day we CAN make a difference.hope is NOT a bad thing.
B00005JO1G|3.0|MOVIE: What if there was a movie that wasn't about war, but about the soldiers. Jarhead is exactly that, a film about the jarheads who went to war just to grab a gun and kill some Iraqis. That's pretty much what Jarhead is about. No battle, no gore, just guys finding themselves out in the desert. Unfortunetly the film lacks depth, it lacks substance. The audience doesn't grow with the characters, and there is nothing for the audience to work with. There is a scene in the beginning were Jake Gyllenhaal's character starts to narrate some events from his life. Then the camera moves out of the room and the door closes, and his character states that we the audience aren't allowed to see his past. Unfortunetly, by denying the audience the character's background, the characters appear static and then there is nothing to emotionally connect with. The only thing the film boasts is some amazing cinematography and decent acting, but they totally go to waste because of the the weak story. Almost everyone I know wanted to see Jarhead, and you can thank Universal for their brilliant (but deceptive) marketing campaign. The trailer was brilliantly put together while accompanied by \\"Jesus Walks\\" by Kanye West. What this did was appeal the movie to a wider audience. By having a rap song highlight your trailer you open to teens and the urban audience. The tv spots hit hard and fast with the song as well. I knew before I walked in what this movie was about, because I know Sam Mendes as a director and he doesn't do action. So, everyone had expectations for this gung ho war epic, and instead they got a character piece, and that's why alot of people were disssapointed. I was dissapointed because there was never a connection of the characters to the audience, and when there is an emotional distance from the audience to your characters that is never a good sign.<br /><br />ACTING: There is a lot of yelling in this movie, well, that's pretty much all there is. A bunch of young men sitting around in the desert just waiting to kill someone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job, not steller but good.  Jamie Foxx, who was advertised as a main selling point in the trailer, does an acceptable job too. The acting was acceptable, nothing more.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: The cinematography is brilliant, then again we come to expect that from a Sam Mendes film. Unfortunetly, while the film may be pretty to look at it's not interesting to watch. The characters are underdeveloped, and the movie doesn't do much with them.around in the desert just waiting to kill someone. Jake Gyllenhaal does a good job, not steller but good.

B000002OTL|5.0|I just watched Pulp Fiction today for the first time in over a year and I still love it.  What I love just as much, is the soundtrack.  It's fantastic.  It's such a great soundtrack - probably one of the best ever done.  I love Let's Stay Together, Girl You'll Be A Woman and who could forget Jungle Boogie.  This is the best soundtrack out there - go and get it.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Even though I haven't seen \\"A.I.\\" in a long time, its futuristic fantasia of sight and sound, as well as its moral, philosophical, and emotional undertones, have occasionally crept into my thoughts since the last time I saw it. I have also pondered what to write about the film, which I perceive as a haunting meditation on human nature. Oddly enough, its protagonist is a robot named David (Haley Joel Osment), who is made to resemble a boy. As the first robot programmed to feel love, he develops a bond with his human mother Monica (Frances O'Conner).    As one can glean from a number of reviews, whether on Amazon or elsewhere, people have either praised or scorned the film. Much of the scorn comes from those who believe that the late Stanley Kubrick envisioned \\"AI\\" as a stereotypically unsentimental tale, and that director Steven Spielberg turned it into something syrupy. Even some who generally praise \\"AI\\" still shame Spielberg for giving in to his relatively more sentimental worldview towards the end, and ruining what may have been a \\"masterpiece.\\"     As for myself, I belong to the crowd that sees \\"AI\\" as a well-crafted film in its entirety. If Kubrick had lived to direct it, I have little doubt that he would have made an excellent film. However, for whatever reason, Kubrick believed that Spielberg could also do justice to the story, even believing that it suited Spielberg better than him. Perhaps Kubrick paid Spielberg a backhanded compliment because he considered \\"AI\\" too potentially sentimental for his liking, but that sounds rather implausible; I have little doubt that Kubrick could have removed sentimental sheen from a Hallmark Movie of the Week.     Despite the differing worldviews of their films, Spielberg obviously has a deep respect for Kubrick. Several shots seem reminiscent of Kubrick's own films, including \\"Strangelove,\\" \\"2001,\\" and \\"Clockwork.\\" Most of the film deals with Kubrickian themes of human folly and meanness, especially in the cavalier way with which humans treat the almost humanlike robots. David's \\"family\\" treats him like a toy, and Monica ultimately abandons him in the woods, though for more complex reasons. Also, during the subsequent scene at the \\"Flesh Faire,\\" humans watch abandoned robots get destroyed for entertainment; perhaps humans have transcended racism in this futuristic dystopia, but its vestiges are manifested all too clearly in this sequence. All this disappears in the film's \\"final act,\\" after humans have become extinct.     Kubrick also respected Spielberg's filmmaking skills, and he believed that the younger director would do something wonderful with \\"AI.\\" Although Spielberg attempted to remain faithful to Kubrick's style, one could still play a parlor game speculating on the elements that would have appeared in a pure Kubrick version of \\"AI.\\" It probably would have been R-Rated, with more scenes portraying the exploits of the pleasure robot Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), as well as some more graphic activities and images in the adult playland Rouge City. Kubrick likely would have included a more extensive sequence in Rouge City with the waltz melody from Richard Strauss' opera \\"Der Rosenkavalier,\\" which John Williams transformed into a brief ethereal snippet.     As Williams mentions in the featurette about the music from \\"AI,\\" Kubrick specifically requested that the film include the waltz melody from \\"Der Rosenkavalier.\\" However, he apparently did not give specifics about its use. Williams decided to have the reconstituted excerpt accompany David's and Gigolo Joe's hitched ride into Rouge City, which seems apt since \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\" could be summarized superficially as a bedroom farce. However, both the opera and film have similar themes, including musings on the passage of time; the facades we use to fool others and ourselves; and trying desperately to hold on to someone we love before we have to let go. It even would have seemed appropriate to have the moving trio from the end of the opera at the conclusion of the film.    The \\"final act,\\" set during an ice age 2,000 years after the other events in the film, remains controversial since it does not have the trademark cynicism of Kubrick's other work. I could never understand why some people believed that the movie should have ended when David fell into the water after being pursued by the authorities; such an ending would have seemed too abrupt. However, I finally realized upon reading a recent Amazon review that they might have been referring to his futile attempts to be turned into a \\"real boy\\" by the Blue Fairy statue at the underwater Coney Island. That ending does seem aptly Kubrickian, underscoring the impossibility of achieving many of our own grand dreams, even though we hope against hope that we will actually fulfill them.    Now that I realize the possibility of that ending, I suppose I should condemn Spielberg for not stopping at that point. However, in good conscience, I cannot deny that I was profoundly moved by the film's conclusion, where a team of robots finds David frozen in ice and reactivates him to learn about their predecessor's history. In an hommage to the recreation of a familiar environment for another David in another Kubrick film, the robots recreate the \\"AI\\" David's home from 2,000 years earlier. At David's request, they also resurrect a replica of his human mother Monica from a strand he kept of her hair. However, they tell David that she will live only one day. After spending a \\"perfect day\\" together as parent and child, Monica finally tells him before \\"going to sleep\\" that she loves him, reciprocating his own perfect (albeit programmed) love for her. Perhaps such a reunion is not a scientific possibility (Ist's ein Traum?), but it works at a level that transcends the rational. (And, yes, I also cried when Ellie Arroway met the extraterrestrial who appeared as her dead father in \\"Contact,\\" and when Fox Mulder finally met his sister's \\"spirit\\" in the \\"Closure\\" episodeof \\"The X-Files.\\") The conditions of the reunion stipulated by David's \\"descendants\\" makes the finale even more powerful, the camera fading out just before the sad finality that occurs beyond the confines of the film. Although David has another chance to be with Monica, which seems like a happy way to conclude the film, the ending reminds us of what we all need to confront as we go through life: saying goodbye permanently to those we love. For this reason, I disagree most strongly with those who claim that \\"AI\\" has a happy ending.     Unless we could somehow bring him back to life, we will never know Kubrick's opinion about Spielberg's treatment of \\"AI.\\" Some will continue to shake their heads and remain convinced that Spielberg totally ruined Kubrick's vision. However, like a number of films that received mixed reviews and generated little box office revenue, \\"AI\\" may be re-evaluated and praised in the coming years by critics who do not believe that Spielberg betrayed the memory and trust of Kubrick. After all, Kubrick's own films did not receive \\"universal\\" critical acclaim immediately; time worked in favor of Kubrick's own movies, just as it may work for Spielberg's bittersweet tribute to Kubrick.
B000B63IEI|1.0|I am shocked to read that others find this recording satisfactory or even better than that.  I have listened to and loved these pieces for over 50 years, but somehow until now avoided any performance as poorly played, badly conducted, and recorded in so muddy a fashion as this. How can a modern recording so disguise and hide the notes?  Given the playing, though, perhaps this is not such a bad thing.  Outrageous liberties with tempi are taken by both the pianist and the conductor -- at nonsensical moments -- that bend these works entirely out of shape, turning them into something more like what one hears in the background at pretentious department stores. How can anyone, I mean anyone at all, even on a bad day, play the Second with so little conception of what the melodic line is?  The First may be youthful and overly laced with broad, loud chord structures in the first movement, limited by a simplistic musical idea, but there is much that is beautiful in this writing in the second and thrid movements, all of which is lost in this miserable effort. I have said enough.  My advice: try the master's own recordings first (they are better recorded, amazingly, and, of course, beter played) and go from there. Others play this music magnificently. Ashkenazy with Previn might be the best for now, but how I wish Argerich would take these on, as she has the Third (a breath-taking effort) and the two Chopin concerti.  Do not, under any circumstances, begin or, for that matter, end here. The pianist and conductor were unknown to me before listening to this and I wish they had stayed that way.     ps 12/16/05 Tommasini of the Times thinks that this is a notable recoding of the year.  I'll steer clear of his other recommendations from now on.
B00000JY1X|5.0|Few artists could claim to creating such sprawling, ambitious piece of music that barely has an ounce of pretention throughout it's entire proceedings. Nor could many artists claim to writing 69 songs all about one theme and not suffer from large amounts of obvious filler, too much uniformity, pretention, and bombast.     Nonetheless, this is incredibly successful for such a feat, and with 3 albums worth of material, i'd be hard-pressed to pick out about 4 songs that are just merely \\"good\\" on the whole entire thing. Most bands would sell their souls for one of Stephin Merritt's merely \\"good\\" songs. The rest of the songs on here range from really great to downright achingly brilliant. I mean, to the point where you wanna thank this guy for making music. This guy is an amazing songwriter, and one of the best songwriters of the past 25 years.     These songs are diverse as hell, ranging from all sorts of genres from the 20th century (except one which is a clever medieval send-up). The lyrics are incredibly witty, sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes absolutely hilarious, but mostly just downright clever and meaningful. I'm not even one to compliment lyrics either, but when i'm listening to some of these songs, the lyrics jump out at you and you can't help but notice. Not many artists i can say that about, and i listen to a very very large amount of music. The actual songwriting is also incredibly well-written, crafted, uniquely arranged with a lot of ukelele (who the hell uses ukelele on an indie-pop album as much as this guy?) and of course instruments ranging from all over the spectrum from accordians, strings, acoustics, electronic keyboards, pianos, drum machines, harpsichord etc. The melodies are instantly memorable and melodic, with appropriate singers to sing them.     There's just very much to be said about this album, and actually i'm dying to go track-by-track, since there's so much to be said about these songs individually, but i'm sure that'd take up too much space. If you like classic pop music of old, especially from the 60's (with a huge nod to 80s synth pop on many songs) then you definitely won't be disappointed with this set. Even if you're only familar with newer indie groups, if you happen to have absolutely ANY affection for melodically fun rock/pop music at all whatsoever, seek this out as soon as possible.
1561385107|5.0|A century and a quarter after it first appeared, \\"Treasure Island\\" is still the quintessential story of pirates and treasure, the one that all others are measured against.  It is also by far the most \\"readable\\" (if you can handle a little 18th Century nautical slang) of all so-called Literary Classics.  If they made you read it in school, try it again; if you missed it in school, give it a try now.<br /><br />What gives this novel its peculiar staying power?  Why can it still fascinate a reader (child OR adult) of the 21st Century?  Well Robert Louis Stevenson is one of the great storytellers to start with, and since he was writing it for a child, his stepson, Treasure Island lacks some of the Victorian literary fashions that otherwise could have dated it.  Also piracy and treasure hunting offer ample opportunities for exciting adventure.  In addition Long John Silver is a truly brilliant creation; a character whose conflicted ambiguity has resulted in dramatic interpretations over the years ranging from total villain to foster father.<br /><br />However, I think the forgotten ingredient is simply this: unlike most fictional treasure hunts, in Treasure Island the good guys get to keep the treasure.  Stop and think how many treasure hunt stories end instead with the treasure being lost forever or returned to the rightful owners and the heroes ending up with nothing or just a handful that leaves them little if any better off than they were.  But the truth is that whatever the dangers of getting rich quick most of us would be willing to take the risk if we could find a treasure that belonged to no one else.  Treasure Island feeds this need in a way that very few of its imitators do.<br /><br />As for this edition, [[ASIN:1561385107 Treasure Island (Courage Classics)]], I like it because it includes the fascinating essay RLS wrote about writing Treasure Island, particularly the genesis of Long John Silver.
0385510454|5.0|This book kept my interest just like Dan Brown's Di Vinci Code & Angels & Demons.  I can't believe how good John Grisham continues to keep it simple yet put you right in the middle of the action at every turn of the page!  He's a master of suspense!
B00005JO1J|5.0|As a teenager, I must say this musical is AWESOME. Despite some people claiming the actors are far to old for their parts, I disagree. I personally do think they look young enough for the parts and their voices are quality. I loved the rendition of all the songs performed and I especially fell in love with La Vie Boheme. It was so outragously funny that the theatre I was in was in stitches. Definately worth seeing and I can't WAIT until it comes out on DVD. This is one movie I will definately be the first in line for.
1400032717|2.0|This book has a really interesting and unusual plot (a dog murder-mystery being solved by an autistic English boy--wow!).  I give its author a lot of credit for creativity.  However, I really couldn't get immersed into the story and about halfway through I stopped reading.  I wish I saw what everyone else does in this book, because I really wanted to like it.  Don't let me stop you from reading it, though, because many of my friends loved it. Somehow it just wasn't my cup of tea. You may like it if you like kooky, creative, off the beaten path. For me, it was just too unusual and just not relatable enough.
0385335482|5.0|Warning: Don't touch this book unless you have a sense of humour! It is a funny, easy read. Reading Shopaholic, sometimes I had a feeling that Sophie Kinsella wrote about me:)<br />Even though the book is hilarious, the main idea is serious: be careful with your money otherwise you will find yourself in huge debt, just like the main character. And by the way, Rebecca Bloomwood is not dumb, she is sweet and funny, she is just weak when it comes to shopping:)

B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul is my favorite Beatles Album (with Revolver [U.S.] coming in at a close 2nd). <br /> <br />When The Beatles' catalog was released on CD back in 1987(?), I of course went and bought them all. But I was sorry that I was not getting the U.S. releases of their 1964-1966 albums. After years and years of listening to the Parlophone CD's, I never quite accepted them as the actual albums. How could I when I was first introduced to The Beatles through the American LP's? <br /> <br />I feel that the laid-back folkiness of the U.S. Rubber Soul was lost with the addition of tracks like, \\"Drive My Car\\". \\"Rubber Soul\\" will forever be kicked-off with \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\", followed by \\"Norweigian Wood\\" in MY mind. The Capitol release is superior in that there was a definite.... \\"design\\" behind the play list. The UK version is simply all of their latest songs bunched up onto one record (\\"Yesterday and Today\\" did the job nicely in getting the \\"orphaned\\" Rubber Soul and Help tracks out there). <br /> <br />Come on, Apple! Release the 1965 U.S. albums, already.... so I can have my beloved Capitol \\"Rubber Soul\\"!!!
B0007P3582|1.0|50 is a hustler. The only reason he beefs with other rappers is to clear the field and be able to sell the same crap they sell. Like your friendly neighbourhood pusher. Hey, got some beats from suppliers, got distributon and go! He is not an artist, he is a hustler with badly cut coke in a good neighbourhood. Otherwise, album is whack. Don't be surprised to find special \\"G-Unit\\" edition Twinkies in your supermarket very soon.
B000001EUR|4.0|With their 1983 release \\"Love at First Sting\\" the German metal band The Scorpions toned down a bit from their early RCA recordings and added more pop to the mix. Love at First Sting came along at the time when hardrock and pop metal began ruling the charts. The album is full of rockers, with a couple of ballads thrown in. Songs like \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\" cemented the Scorpions legacy, guarnteeing the Scorpions would be rememberd over twenty years after the release of one  of their best albums.  <br /> Besides \\"Rock You Like a Hurricane\\", other highlights include Big City Nights, Coming Home, and Still Loving You. If you're a fan of the 80's popmetal and hardrock, Love at First Sting belongs in your music collection.  <br />
B000001EUL|4.0|Lovedrive came out in 1979 and it was the first album for guitarist Mathias Jabs, after virtuoso Uli Jon Roth left the band. Michael Schenker, ex-UFO and the Scorpions original guitarist featured on their debut Lonesome Crow, was asked to re-join but he eventually decided to go solo. Apparently he played on three tracks. This album has a lot of variety, from the reggae rock of Is There Anybody There to the rock steady instrumental Coast to Coast. Then there are the two ballads, the emotional Always Somewhere and the relaxing Holiday. There are also a couple of over the top rockers, Another Piece Of Meat and Can't Get Enough. Last but not least are the cool title track and the excellent Loving You Sunday Morning (sounds like Michael on lead guitar). All in all Lovedrive was a good diverse album by the Scorpions. Four and a half stars!
B00063MBU8|1.0|Yea, i know. It's \\"cool\\" to bash on these punk-pop bands... According to the bloody SOAD lovers at just about every high-school in the world. We all know how crap this band and all the others exactly like it are. So there's not much point in saying why this so. Oh, and the only reason that I reviewed this piece of $#!@ is because Simple Plan happen to be the favorite band of this girl I really like at school. Her name is.... I won't say it in case she reads this review... Very very unlikely though... <br /> <br />And for those who enjoy listening to good music. Hang in there, it will become cool again. We just need another Nirvana-esque explosion from the underground scene. Not nessasarily a Nirvana-esque band though. Definetly not, actually. <br /> <br />Well, these Simple Plan guys are either complete idiots, or extremely smart \\"business-men\\". Damn, they must have *alot* of money right now.
B00005JOHI|5.0|Once again, I have had the pleasure of finding one of Jane Austen's classic novels brought to the big screen -- and once more I couldn't fancy myself happier.  Ah- would that there were hundreds of such renderings!<br /><br />Jane Austen's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is amongst all in the whole vast world of literature the dearest to my heart.  Therefore, even a version that deigns tamper with a decade-old perfection serves to excite my interest.  Indeed- for I was simply ecstatic when, in 1995, A&E and the BBC collaborated to create a grand and brilliantly performed portrayal of that book.  At a length of nearly 6 hours, no aspect of this wonderful story had been neglected - and I knew that such a true commitment to the literature, combined with such passion for the tale, is a precious rarity in film. Now, years hence, that 1995 picture still resonates.  Comparisons are to be inevitable, no doubt.  I'd already been well reconciled to the fact that a two-hour version of the story, no matter how well done, could only suffer in the comparison to that A&E production.  I therefore resolved to judge this movie by its own qualities -- And what fine qualities they turned out being!  Brilliantly directed by Joe Wright, this sensual and earthy interpretation just warms my soul.<br /><br />Keira Knightley takes on the role of our heroine: Elizabeth Bennet, the 2nd oldest of the five daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet (Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn).  Matthew MacFadyen plays our hero: Mr. Darcy, the handsome and aloof owner of a great estate in the north of England.  The two go down the dance, waltzing through misunderstanding and mischance - wit and romance, dexterously stepping along fine lines of social propriety and distinction of class, through rejection and redemption, conjuring the many diversions of country life in Regency England. Yes, we Janeites all know the story.<br /><br />The casting herein is essentially very agreeable.  Knightly is lovely and makes for a fine Elizabeth, and the camera adores her- though when Darcy finds her appearance only \\"tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me,\\" it strikes one as rather unbelievable.  She effortlessly captures Lizzy's wry spirit and spark of humor, though I must admit I found her a little bit wanting in that quiet depth or the brilliance of mind that role calls for.<br /><br />MacFadyen's take on Darcy is more dark and brooding than actors in the past have portrayed him.  And though I enjoyed watching him, I cannot say that he did very well in expressing the changes Mr. Darcy undergoes:  I did not see an aristocrat stuffed with pride, whose passion for Elizabeth blossoms as he becomes transformed by her spirited influence.  Rather, he just seems to convey the same brooding manner all along - and his only problem appears to be that he is misunderstood.<br /><br />As for the supporting players, I think Sutherland was excellent as the bemused Mr. Bennet - and his scene with Lizzy at the end was exquisitely drawn.  Blethyn played her part very well, too - her Mrs. Bennet was every bit as laughable and endearing as Austen wrote her.  Judi Dench was wonderfully formidable as Lady Catherine de Bourgh.  The roles of Mr. Collins, Jane Bennet, Mr. Bingley and Wickham were also excellently played.<br /><br />Visually, this film is just stunning.  I've rarely, if ever, seen more exquisite scenery in a movie. The camera work is mesmerizing.  The cinematography here is certainly Oscar-worthy.  I can even forgive the overly rusticated state (complete with chickens, pigs, & all manner of livestock traipsing throughout the house) of Longbourn, the Bennet family home.  This, in fact, only serves to give charm to this beautiful and totally unique rendition of a most beloved story.dores her- though when Darcy finds her appearance only \\"tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me,\\" it strikes one as rather unbelievable.

0140067477|1.0|To see the behavior and mindset of Winnie the Pooh as representative of the Great Way is one thing; \\"just as he is,\\" as one might say, even though as a fictional character Pooh is a secondary representation of sentient being-in-reality.  That is to say, he exists only in our imagination as a construction of language but does not exist in the real world.  He is an illusion; yet he can serve as an imagined role model of sentience, perhaps even of enlightenment if we choose to dream him as such.<br /><br />But one should not confuse unenlightened ignorance with the sentience of non-duality no matter how childlike Pooh appears in his textual innocence.  In fact, the very comparison jumps the track from The Tao into the trap of duality just as we all do here.  I suppose we can excuse Benjamin Hoff as being \\"a finger pointing at the moon\\" despite that this allegorical attempt never gets the honey jar off its nose.<br /><br />In the initial chapters, Hoff's treatment of science lacks a clear understanding of how capable many scientists are of simply observing natural phenomena, sometimes even in a Taoist or Zen Buddhist way.  Einstein even described Buddhism, related to Taoism, as the perfect way of the scientist.  Hoff was in his early 30s when he wrote this book and I wonder what he would say about science now that he is in his 50s with more maturity and skilled practice in the true art of living simply and \\"polishing the mirror\\" of his mind.  In fact, any cognitive therapist or self-explored practitioner of meditation,  whether Taoist or otherwise, can easily recognize the fallacies of \\"gross generalization\\" and \\"minimization\\" that he dualistically applies while erroneously committing science to the pejorative categories he falsely constructs somewhere in his own fogged mirror.  As a practitioner of Zen, I found this ironic -- that he criticized science and scientists alike -- in fact he seemed to criticize all scholars and/or \\"thinkers\\" -- for being uselessly enthralled to their own narrowly labeled \\"categories\\" when in fact he was committing the very same egregiously unenlightened thinking errors with his own projected, biased, dualistic and overly simplistic categories.<br /><br />This is not to say that the scientist never misses the forest for the trees -- which seemed to be his point.  But in making it, he appeared in denial of the trees while condescendingly instructing the learned on the forest -- a mistake made by many a novice in the art of becoming effectively and truely aware.<br /><br />At first I suspected he, like so many others, was unwittingly revealing himself a phony -- a tree trimmer by trade who seemed unconsciously jealous of scientists for their degrees, \\"knowledge\\" and learning.  Certainly Emanuel Kant would be laughing his ass off.  Of Kant's five recognized epistemological methods for knowing truth -- Tenacity, Authority, Experience, Reason and Science -- the young Benjamin Hoff seems to have fallen into the traps of the lower levels of \\"knowing\\" -- Tenacity, Authority and (unfortunately, unenlightened) Experience -- without recognizing that each of the five should be integrated, each supporting the others, and used as *tools* in coming to \\"Right Thinking\\" in the Great Universal \\"Way.\\"<br /><br />Poor Pooh!  He is mistaken for one of the Holy Ones, a person of compassion and wisdom, a sentient being given to countless ways of loving kindness, a Bodhisattva, when  in fact, if Pooh were real, he is being exploited and abused in the allegory crammed cerebral cortex of Been-Jamin' Hoff in Taoist drag.<br /><br />This book is for beginners written by a beginner.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|How many times has this album been \\"released\\" in order to garner sales? I realized that this album flopped internationally, so she has to make a buck somehow. The only good song on this album is \\"It's Like That,\\" only because the beat is addicting. Still, it's pathetic that Mariah has to constantly surround herself with rappers in order to stay relevant.
B000001EUR|4.0|After the strong Blackout album the Scorpions came back with an album that would put them near the top of the rock charts at #6. The videos for Rock You Like A Hurricane and the ballad Still Loving You were constantly on MTV and every rock station. I can still remember buying this on cassette. The girl behind the counter saw the cover and the expression on her face turned to disgust. But she was probably more envious than disgusted (give her inches indeed!). I did not like Love At First Sting as much as earlier Scorpion's albums at first. Maybe because they became everybody's band and I found it hard to get into it the whole album. They were certainly starting to write more for radio and MTV. But looking back now I think it was the best thing they did from 1984 until the very good Unbreakable album in 2004. My favorites are Bad Boys Running Wild with its cool heavy riff and the catchy I'm Leaving You. I also like the dreamy Coming Home that eventually kicks into a good rocker. Still Loving You is an emotional ballad with tasty melodic guitar. The other hit, Rock You Like A Hurricane, has a great verse/chorus and a kick ass guitar solo by Mathias. Big City Nights and As Soon As The Good Times Roll are both good songs with cool riffs and catchy choruses. I never really cared for Crossfire or The Same Thrill, not bad songs but not very interesting either. Overall a solid 4 stars.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is one of the best movies I have seen recently. This is a great drama/fantasy film that almost had me in tears more than once while I watched it. Ewan McGregor and the others did a fantastic in this film. It was good to see Steve Buscimi in the film as well, since I'm a fan of his.<br /><br />Like always, the scenery and the places that the story took place in looked amazing, almost like a fairy tale world within the mind of Tim Burton. This fit in well for this story since the entire film is like watching a modern day fairy tale come to life. I was very surprised with how good this movie was, this has definitely become one of my favorite movies that I have seen recently.
B00005JM20|4.0|No, no.  Not another James Bond spoof!  Yup.  And it's darn well about time the DEFINITIVE SPOOF finally emerged (it only took four decades) .  This is a tour de force by Rowan Atkinson (a global treasure) who is a multitalented (and multijointed) British comedian.  A master of all the genres of humor from physical to pantomime to facial to verbal, in JOHNNY ENGLISH he has the opportunity to often display them all--simultaneously!  This is Mr. Atkinson's best end-to-end comedic work since the 1999 mini film BLACK ADDER BACK & FORTH (based on the rollicking BLACK ADDER BBC TV series).  Picture and sound are state of the art.  The last 10 minutes can literally leave you rolling on the floor in laughter.  Even with repeat viewings!  Consider a safety harness when viewing this DVD alone.  There is no DVD booklet or, for that matter, anything attached to the inside of the left side of the DVD case.  A missed opportunity. <br /> <br />William Flanigan, Ph.D.
B00064WSN2|5.0|Yes, the album has similarities to album one, but i consider it an extension of one rather than a second album, since it had no touring band and some of the pieces were left over from ITCOTCK (pictures of a city, the devil's triangle, etc.) Overall, this album has some of the most beautiful tracks Crimson has ever laid on tape. Listen to Cadence & Cascade and In The Wake Of Poseidon for heart-wrenching melodies and vocals, Pictures Of A City and Catfood for insane riffs, and The Devil's Triangle for one of the most haunting, albeit repetitive, pieces of music ever written (based on Holst's Mars, in the first Crim's repotoire). The Peace Beginning, Theme, and Ending are all excellent, separate the album nicely, and are beautiful indeed. By this album, and shame on the reviewers for making it a 3/5.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I have listened  to this album for 10 days before I was ready to post my review. Each day I've been wondering which is my favourite song. I've seen every promotional performance for this album at Madonnalicious.com. I can tell you something, \\"M\\" has never stopped maturing both in musical and physicall ways. She's today as great as she was in 1989. It was 1984, back when I was a child, when I bought a 12\\" vynil LP by a new artist called Madonna. I tought she was a black singer when I first heard \\"Borderline \\" and inmediately fell in love with her, as many of us did. Those days you can hear \\"Lucky Star\\" in every US radio station every 30 minutes. A star was born !  She has given us lots of joy over the years. The 80's are perfect and we all agree about that fact. The 90s reviews have varied a lot. I enjoyed American Life, but dislike the Erotica period, the Sex book and the raunchy image....No need for that (in my own subjective and conservative opinion ). I tought: \\"The Queen of Pop is making every effort to cave her own grave \\". There was no need for that, specially after so many consecutive anthems such as Like a Prayer, Express Yourself, Cherrish, Keep it Together and Vogue. I must had seen it coming after hearing \\"Justify my Love\\" from the Inmaculate Collection  and buying the MTV banned video. I enjoyed because they were very hipped, but I must confess that they didn't move me as her previous material. I bough 1992's \\"Erotica\\" along with all the Maxi Singles taken from that album, but I hated \\"Deeper and Deeper\\", both the song and the video. She looked awful in that video . In fact, she looks 10 times better in the \\"Hung Up\\" video 13 years later. The \\"Rain\\" video and song saved the Erotica album and redimmed her to my eyes... Gorgeous as we loved to see her. I enjoyed \\"Bedtime Stories\\" the album as any avid fan, but where is the glitter of our star. I wanted to get into the groove, I wanted to dance for inspiration. Where is my Madonna? \\"Take a Bow\\" was such a big hit and a great song, but it was a ballad and I can't dance to it! \\"Bedtime Stories\\" is one of the best \\"M\\" videos I've seen, but sadly it failed at the charts. It was not pop, but a Bjork song ( I loved it anyway....but I can't dance).  Then they came \\"Something to Remember\\", the \\"Evita\\" period ( best vocals ever) , \\"Ray of Light\\" ( great, but not my favourite ), \\"Music\\" ( too much of a great song and video), but the rest of the album failed to impressed me. I liked \\"American Life\\" beacuse of its lyrics and I loved the autobanned video, but I can't dance. I couldn't believe how she lost the chance to shoot a sublime & glamorous video for the \\"Hollywood\\" song and I will never forgive \\"M\\" for not having shoot a video for \\"Nothing Fails\\", the best song from that album. The \\"Reinvention Tour\\" was magical. Back to our review: Confessions on a dance Floor is magical. Hung Up is not my favourite song, but it is OK. However, the rest of the album is wonderful. Every time I hear it, I liked it more and more. \\"Get Together\\" is a great song. Have you seen \\"M\\" performing it in the promo shows. She dances in circles and the crowd gets crazy...Just like the good old days ! \\"Sorry\\" is a catchy song and the multilingual opening is great. I was missing that sexy voice that rapped along the \\"Vogue\\" beats. \\"I love New York\\" is Ok, but neither my favourite. \\"Future Lovers\\" is a wonderful song and reminds of Donna Summer's I Feel Love. \\"Let it will be\\" is also great. \\"Forbidden Love\\" is amazing and I love the way it blends with the most danceable song of the album \\"JUMP\\". Other of my favourites are \\"How High\\" and \\"Like it or Not\\", a great way to end this album. This album can easily produce 5 or 6 commercial singles. My favourites 'today' are \\"Get Together\\", \\" Jump \\". I might think differently tomorrow. It's just that most of the songs are so great....So easy to sing along with...and so groovy, but deep at the same time ( as deep as pop is allowed to be ). Pump up the volume and enjoy Madonna's Tour de Force... Best of all: I can dance for inspiration !
B0002RQ2T4|4.0|A very interesting story coupled with nice pictures. I watched the second part first and now the whole story becomes clear.
B0002234LS|4.0|Even though the ending was predictable and borrowed material from other King stories, I just can't escape the incredible acting in this film. Everyone does a wonderful performance and even I thought of The Shining while watching this film. It's definitely your typical King horror story, even though it's not scary, more of a thriller. What I enjoyed most about the film is the ending and Depp singing at the end of the credits. All good fun
B0000075ZB|5.0|The fact that Barry Gibb could give back to Dionne the vocal prowess and stylings that Bacharach & David originally gifted her with in the 60s is alone startling...the achievement is amazing.<br /><br />I was sick and tired of playing my old vinyl so I gave in and bought the import - and it has been worth every dollah!  This is an amazing recording - and once again we must ask - what is wrong with these U.S. record companies?  SO much great stuff is available in Japan & Europe - and they are all American artists! Nothing makes sense in this country anymore - so I can't imagine why I am shocked that such a landmark album as \\"Heartbreaker\\" - the combined genius of Dionne + Bee Gees is not available.  This was a huge hit and the title cut as far as I am concerned is Dionne's best post Bacharach/David single to date.  There are a few - but far between - clunks in some songs on the album - however as far as a cohesive Dionne recording - this is the most listenable full length she ever made.<br /><br />Jazzy, Pop, Dancey, Mellow, Swingy, Groovy.  That is Dionne.<br /><br />HELLO ARISTA?  What is wrong with you?  Release this in the US in a deluxe edition.  All you idiots sign garbage like 50 Cent and expect returns on that in the future?  Good luck.  This is timeless music.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Well, this is my favorite Christmas movie.  Ever.  Some people find that odd, but I love the Charles Dickens and I love the Muppets (some people find that odd as well.).  This is the best Muppets movie ever made, I've been watching it at christmas time since I was little.  Somehow the Muppets manage to keep the spirit of the book in a wonderful way, yet still be quite \\"Mupetty\\".  Be warned however, if you plan to watch this with small children, according to numerous sources from that group, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, or, as he is affectionately called in our home, the toilet-paper ghost, is very frightening.<br /><br />  But this a much better version of 'Christmas Carol' than any other spin-off I've seen, such as the Disney version, which I think would bore most children, and adults to tears.  The look of the movie is very warm and inviting, it's just the sort of movie you want get a great big hug from, if you know what I mean.
B000BTJDG2|4.0|And the winner is obvious.......I thought this film wont be good, but i was surprised..IT WAS BASED ON A TRUE STORY..I never beleived in ghosts..but when you see one and see a exorcism happening (in my real personal life, NOT IN UK another country)..then ..ahem....and yep this film was very good
0307276902|3.0|I quote a friend who also read the book about James having an interesting \\"bottom\\" (referring to alcoholic/addict's reaching the end of their using careers).  It was amazing how much he'd done by the age of 23 when many are just getting serious about using drugs and alcohol.  <br /> <br />His continuous rebellion against the \\"system\\" of the rehab center bothered me. It was as if he could have recovered by himself, yet he stayed there for about six weeks.  I was very annoyed by his arrogance toward other recovery methods such as Alcoholics Anonymous, as if his \\"way\\" is statistically better.  <br /> <br />While no method has very positive results, AA has been working for many for a long time and atheists and agnostics are able to make AA work too. While he \\"bad-mouthed\\" AA, he referred to his Tao book, which, in essence, was working the 12 steps. There were a lot of similarities.  <br /> <br />Finally, he kept insisting on truth from others. If something rang true to him, he accepted it. Yet, I felt he exaggerated quite a few times and he lost credability with me. For example, hugging his mom, he said something like: that was the first time I ever hugged her. Well, I find that hard to believe...ever?? not even as a toddler?? Come on.  <br /> <br />Anyway, no method of recovery from addiction has a lock on success so if this guy got sober at 23 and is still sober 10 years later, I'm really happy for him, however he did it.  <br />He'd be more appealing to me if he got rid of the chip on his shoulder about AA and treatment and got a little bit of humility. I probably won't read his second book. <br /> <br />
B0007OCG56|5.0|This is a great story about two families with completely different ethnic backgrounds living in one house and learning how to get along and become close friends. You have the successful restaurant chef (Sandler) who was named best cook in America, and you have his newly hired maid who has a young daughter both from Mexico who moves in with Sandler's family.<br /><br />The cast and story is great with a somewhat sad ending. This a great film to watch even if you're not a fan of Adam Sandler.
B00005JO04|5.0|As in the stunning \\"Traffic\\" of a few years ago, \\"Syriana\\" adopts the audacious tact of piecing together many plot strains with the intention of making some major points about the need /desperation and unending thirst for Oil. As in \\"Traffic\\" Gaghan sets up a situation in which Oil, not drugs is an obsession, a sickness really...the real stuff of life and he peoples his movie with those who support and thrive on his thesis: the C.I.A, the Arab Nations, the US oil companies. People are victimized, blown-up, tortured, brutalized and even  murdered in service of the all-mighty pursuit of black gold.<br />Writer/Director Stephen Gaghan (writer of \\"Traffic\\") has the sense though of making the proceedings global yet often times heart breakingly personal which only makes his film more persuasive, more contemporary, more like real, rather than reel, life.<br />George Clooney, bloated and bearded and not looking at all like the \\"Worlds Sexiest Man\\" plays a C.I.A. agent, Bob Barnes: a work-horse agent...one who is sent out on missions as a scapegoat, one who is not expected to succeed but time and time again completes his missions to the utter dismay of his superiors: whereas all of his contemporaries are earning raises and respect, he earns neither and in fact he is abhorred for his expertise: definitely a case of someone who gets the job done his own way and does not follow the party line: a rebel. Why? It's never really explained but it is obvious that Barnes is an outsider: a man more sinned against than sinning. And even with the extra 20 pounds, grey beard and baggy, shapeless clothes, Clooney has never been more effective: he's gruff, he's gross, he's driven but he is nonetheless a good guy...someone who always has the big picture in mind and sees and understands the forest despite the trees.<br />We, the audience view much of the action and plot of \\"Syriana\\" en Medias re: we eavesdrop on many scenes as they are unfolding rather than at their inception: a device that was used to great advantage in \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Gosford Park.\\" This process keeps us off-balance and psychologically on our toes: we pay close attention just to \\"keep up\\" and Gaghan, always the consummate storyteller punctuates his films with the rational and irrational stuff that makes us all human. There is also a dark, foreboding, mean-spirited and dangerous side to the story Gaghan is telling here: how do you differentiate the light without the dark? How do you know what is Evil without knowing the Good?<br />\\"Syriana\\" is bravura filmmaking in the best sense: universal yet coming from a personal place. In fact there is a verisimilitude about \\"Syriana\\" that is chilling and frightening: is there indeed a wolf pack of rabid Washington honchos pulling and manipulating the strings that control the world's oil supplies? Gaghan definitely has a point-of-view here and if anything his view might be too mature, too ambitious, too prescient for most of us to digest.reat advantage in \\"Traffic\\" and \\"Gosford Park.\\" This process keeps us off-balance and psychologically on our toes: we pay close attention just to \\"keep up\\" and Gaghan, always the consummate storyteller punctuates his films with the rational and irrational stuff that makes us all human.

B0002MG9SI|5.0|\\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is a film where you want to find the perfect word for describing its charm. There is probably such a word in French, but I would not know what it was. All I know is that quirky, enchanting, and everything I come up with in English is wholy inadequate to the task at hand. The most important thing to know is that \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is a film where you should go see it because so many people love it, even if it requires you to not to do anything else so you can read the subtitles (some people resist such demands and--shudder--listen to dubbed versions of \\"Life is Beautiful\\" and \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\"). I feel about this film the way I did about \\"Memento,\\" where I told people they should see it and refused to tell them anything else because it would ruin the experience (think the Heisenberg principle). However, I think the audience that would enjoy \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" is considerably wider than those who would cotton to \\"Memento\\" (which was a quirky little film).<br /><br />So, I am giving you my strongest recommendation for you to see \\"Am&eacute;lie.\\" Now, if you have not yet seen the film, please go away, because I want to talk to those who have seen the film and while I am not going to be providing what we would traditionally consider \\"spoilers,\\" you really sure come to view this film as pure and chaste as the driven snow (of which we have lots up here).<br /><br />I find it interesting that the film's French title \\"Le Fabuleux destin d'Am&eacute;lie Poulain\\" was reduced to just \\"Am&eacute;lie\\" for American consumption. Combined with the green framed portrait of actress Audrey Tautou smiling impishly as the title character, this certainly does not give viewers a real idea of what they will discover in this film. One of the chief charms of the film for me was how you had to pay attention to the details because almost everything was a clue as to future developments (the exception that proves the rule would be Blubber, whose return we patiently waited for throughout the entire film).<br /><br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Am&eacute;lie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do. We then begin 48 hours in which d'Am&eacute;lie's life is changed. Of course such massive developments hinge on a bottle cap fallen to the floor. Our heroine's efforts to sabotage the life of Collignon (Urbain Cancelier), the Grocer (who will never be confused with an artichoke), struck my funny bone exceedingly hard and her relationship with the Glass Man, Raymond Dufayel (Serge Merlin), was particularly nice, both their discussions about the girl with the wine glass in the Renoir painting and the old man giving her the final push to her destiny. The only question is whether Nino Quincampoix (Mathieu Kassovitz), is really good enough for our girl, but if she is smitten with a man who collects torn up and discarded photographs from photo booths around town, who are we to challenge her choice?<br /><br />The end of the fabulous 48 hours at which point our heroine finds her destiny does not offer a perfect world. Some find true bliss in love, others finally go on trips, but some still right where they started, unpublished, afflicted by imaginary illnesses, or consumed by jealousy. But as long as Am&eacute;lie lives happily ever after we are content. I pity the person who does not fall in love with this film.r /> <br />Jean-Pierre Jeunet establishes the fabulous world of Amlie Poulain in the creative prologue, which establishes what each of our cast of characters likes to do.

B0007QJ1MK|3.0|I was a carry-over Kyuss fan who starting listening to Queens simply because of Josh Homme.  He is definately the creative force behind both projects, and has consistently cranked out quality for years.  This one feels a little clocked in.  My hunch is that the next album will be better.  If your a huge fan, buy it.  The casual listener should just stick to downloading a couple of singles.  On the plus side, it is pretty sweet not to hear Nick Oliveri butchering the vocals.  The only loss is his bass.
B000002N3N|5.0|I will say that this is a very personal album for me.  Life has made it so.  Usually that is what I do with music that moves me...I bring it into myself and make it personal. (I'm sure most people do that.) <br /> <br />You know how people have \\"names\\"?  Like on my birth certificate it says my first name is Jeffrey.  Well, I chose for myself a \\"musical name\\" and for several years now, it has been the title track to this album \\"The Memory of Trees\\".  For me,  despite whatever the actual intent of singer/songwriter with this piece, it represents my 'inner innocent child-like dreamy self' that I aspire to be, that if I am at my best, I am.  So if I'm feeling \\"down\\" and need to remind myself that I am better or that I can be better, I listen to \\"The Memory of Trees\\" piece.  <br /> <br />Perhaps strange.  But it is what it is to me now. <br /> <br />The piece \\"Hope Has A Place\\", is a song I attach not to a \\"romantic\\" love, but to someone I love in general who held me up when things were not at all great.  Enya's voice is like that someone's voice singing, as they held me up.  A love, much more complex and wide-ranging than just romantic love, breathes out in this song.  These words are my favorite:  <br /> <br />\\"Whispering world, a sigh of sighs, <br />The ebb and the flow of the ocean tides. <br />One breath, one word may end or may start <br />A hope in a place of the lover's heart.\\" <br /> <br />Very slow and graceful.  I can feel my pulse just slowing and I can just feel myself floating and melting into caring arms with them.  Are their any slower, quieter images than these, relaxing images than these? <br /> <br />All of her albums are welcome, because she breathes and sighs and sings so gracefully, elegantly and without any \\"poisons\\" in her words.  Her voice makes me float in this album (and it all the others).
B000AA7BP2|5.0|The Buggles have their place in music history because their quirky hit \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" has the distinction of being the first music video shown on MTV. But their 1980 debut album \\"Age of Plastic\\" deserves to be remembered on its own terms; not just for the \\"futuristic\\" music, but because the lyrics represent a coherent critique of the world of technology as being full of potential but fraught with peril. Even a cursory look at \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" shows the song is offering up less than subtle ironies about the medium of pop music, not to mention the fledgling MTV. The Buggles consisted of the tandem of Geoffrey Downes on percussion/keyboards and Trevor Horn doing bass/guitar/percussion/vocals, both of who were obviously more interested in producing. That same year they produced the Yes album \\"Drama,\\" and the pair ended up joining the group and replacing Jon Anderson and Rick Wakeman.<br /><br />Pay attention to the lyrics on this album. \\"Kid Dynamo\\" is about the death of imagination in the age of mass media, a proposition that is clearly becoming more and more obvious with each year. \\"I Love You Miss Robot\\" is not kinky, despite its title, and is about the pitfalls of human dependence on technology. As for the music, it is pretty diverse. \\"\\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" is upbeat and peppy while \\"Johnny on the Monorail\\" is the exact opposite, dark and brooding. Of course, at the time the use of electronic devices was considered cutting edge and the novelty of it all distracted from the potency of the lyrics. The Alan Parsons Project tried to do something along these lines with with 1977's \\"I Robot,\\" but that effort seems ponderous and pretentious when compared to \\"Age of Plastic.\\" I think I could make a compelling argument that this is one of the top ten, or at least top two dozen albums, from the decade (and you can go either way on that as the end of the 1970s or the start of the 1980s).
B00005JLD4|4.0|I loved the brave little girls who ran away from the racist situation in their country.  It amazes me how the white run government took the liberty to believe they had the right over other people's lives!  I was confused about the tracker's daughter being there as I understood the settlement to be for half caste children.  How did he get a half caste child then? Surely this was impossible unless they (the goverment) took full Aboriginies as well.  I cannot imagine him being married to a white women with all those crazy racist rules that were being implemented.  I found the children very beautiful and the racist system of Austrailia sickening.  They should look back at this slice of their history and be deeply ashamed.
0393327655|2.0|I read with interest the book entitled \\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris. Arguably, the key passage that sets the tone for the book can be found on page 13. It states: <br /> <br />Our situation is this: most of the people in the world believe that the Creator of the universe has written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility. People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept-rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism. Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not. All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however: \\"respect\\" for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God endorses. While all faiths have been touched, here and there, by the spirit of ecumenicalism, the central tenet of every religious tradition is that all others are mere repositories of error or, at best, dangerously incomplete. Intolerance is thus intrinsic to every creed. Once a person believes-really believes-that certain ideas can lead to eternal happiness, or to its antithesis, he cannot tolerate the possibility that the people he loves might be led astray by the blandishments of unbelievers. Certainty about the next life is simply incompatible with tolerance in this one. <br /> <br />The problem is that the author, having made this statement, proceeds to practice the very thing he decries in the pages that follow. He does this, I suspect, because he is blind to his own position. No one has seen God; therefore, the assertion that He does not exist is as much a faith-based proposition as is the assertion that He does exist. What matters is what basis one provides for one's faith or non-faith-a topic of discussion for another day and one not directly addressed by the author. By conveniently excluding his own faith based world-view from the aforementioned passage, however, the author sets his own beliefs in the most favorable and reasonable light. In doing so, he is guilty of attempting to remove the speck from his neighbor's eye without paying any attention to the log in his own eye. Were he to include the world-view of those like him who neither believe in a Creator or in the after-life, he would more correctly have written the following: <br /> <br />Our situation is this: most of the people in the world believe that the Creator of the universe has or has not written a book. We have the misfortune of having many such books-including those that argue that a Creator does not exist-on hand, each making an exclusive claim as to its infallibility. People tend to organize themselves into factions according to which of these incompatible claims they accept-rather than on the basis of language, skin color, location of birth, or any other criterion of tribalism. Each of these texts urges its readers to adopt a variety of beliefs and practices, some of which are benign, many of which are not. All are in perverse agreement on one point of fundamental importance, however: \\"respect\\" for other faiths, or for the views of unbelievers, is not an attitude that God, or for those who do not believe in God, that they, endorse(s). While all faiths have been touched, here and there, by the spirit of ecumenicalism, the central tenet of every religious and anti-religious tradition is that all others are mere repositories of error or, at best, dangerously incomplete. Intolerance is thus intrinsic to every creed. Once a person believes-really believes-that certain ideas can lead to eternal, or for those that do not believe in eternity, true earthly, happiness, or to its antithesis, he cannot tolerate the possibility that the people he loves might be led astray by the blandishments of unbelievers (or believers). Certainty about the next lifeor for the unbeliever this life, is simply incompatible with tolerance in this one. <br /> <br />Ultimately, as he states in the Afterword of his book, even among atheists-those who a priori would be expected to embrace the ideas in his book-there are more than a few (based on their letters) that disagree strongly as to whether to call the author a \\"true\\" non-believer-a fact, he finds disappointing (I must say I find this surprising). Thus, I strongly suspect, that even if the authors' nave wish-that faith would disappear-were to become true, conflicts between non-believers over nuances of what constitutes true unbelief would rise to fill the vacuum. Why? Because the problem is not with the tribalisms that the author refers to. People-rich, poor, black, white, North, South-will disagree about issues-religious or not-about which they have strong opinions. Is it inconceivable to imagine that over time some of these issues could become so divisive that they could lead to armed conflict. History tells us that men have fought over and died over the silliest of issues. This is an unmistakable reality:  Humankind will always have issues that divide, some for which they will be prepared to lay down their lives. What the author hopes to do is to replace current dichotomies (by no means homogenous) such as the Christian worldview vs. other worldviews, the Islamic worldview vs. other worldviews, the atheistic worldview vs. other worldviews with a new singularity, i.e. atheism. Yet if the goal is to secure the peace by promoting one viewpoint, surely we can achieve the same goal simply by replacing all these dichotomies with any singularity. Why not choose Christianity, Islam or some other faith as the common truth-then we would all get along. But would such a peace last? Wouldn't new ideologies, beliefs and theories, arise even within the sphere of anti-faith (similar to Sunni-Shiite groupings in Islam, or Catholic-protestant groupings in Christianity) to replace those recently banished. It appears to me, based on recent history, that they most certainly would. Consequently, the real solution seems to lie in how we resolve extant conflicts. To that end, I would rather choose the Man who said \\"forgive your enemies\\" \\"do good to those who hurt you\\", \\"if slapped turn the other cheek\\", the one who ultimately \\"walked the talk\\" by dying on the cross-all the while praying for his executioners. For me, that example is a far better prescription for peace than the proposal put forth by the author that people can and should be convinced to transfer their allegiances from faith to anti-faith.
B0001Z37HM|1.0|I don't feel Red Sonja is any better or worse plot wise than Conan The Destroyer.  However I found the picture quality to be one of the poorest I have seen on DVD.  It resembled that of an old VHS.  There were white creases in the print; not distracting but noticable, and the picture was grainy throughout, sound had a slight muffled quality to it, not crisp.   <br /> <br />I own about 500 DVD's and counting, don't write reviews because there are many of you out there that write really good ones.  But what I will do from now on is share with the rest of you when I come across poor transfers.
B000002J09|5.0|End of story.  Stop reading reviews and go listen to it.  If you dont own it buy it immediately.  Before listening to it hold it in your hands and realize that you are holding a work of art beyond human comprehension.  Every song is amazing, there are no flaws whatsoever at any point in this album.  The greatest thing that has ever been produced by the human race.  No joke.
B000002UAX|5.0|Putting it simply, there isn't such a thing as a bad Beatles record.  At worst, the Beatles maybe have three or four songs that are just okay, the rest are classics.   To not like the Beatles is the same as to not like Christmas or the sun.
B000B5253E|4.0|WOW! The ethereal power behind this band is mind-boggling. As a guitarist, I am blown away by the ability of the guitarists, Matt and Padge! I was first exposed to BFMV in July, when I stumbled upon the Trustkill Records \\"Takeover\\" sampler at a Hot Topic in St.Petersburg, Florida. It was love at first listen. I was quick to purchase the album from the band's site when it was released in the UK and Asia on October 3rd. It took about a month to reach me, but that is neither here nor there. The album is chock full of hits. The guitar solos are reminiscent of the late great Dimebag Darrell, as well as the reigning gods of heavy metal, Zakk Wylde and Kerry King. I recommend this album to any metalhead, as well as some of the alright emo losers. Yes, this album has a great deal of emo influence, though the talent of the guitarists outdoes any emo band on their best day.The vocals are perfect for the band's sound! Check it out if you do not wish to wait until February 16, 2006.
1594200653|4.0|For some reason the modern history of Europe doesn't seem to catch the attention of many writers so I was glad when I saw this book. Most of what I know about Europe in this century revolves around either of the two world wars. I think Judt does a great job of filling in the blanks. I especially like that this history concerns all of Europe - so many books focus on France or Germany or England and leave out the likes of Czechoslovakia or other `lesser' countries. The book is long and not always easy reading as would be expected with a book of this breadth. Judt does an admirable job with such a complex and detailed topic. I think that the history of Europe as a block is just beginning and this is a great foundation to understanding how they got where they are and where they are going.
B0000041Z6|5.0|So many Mahler performances, both in concert and on record, are mannered to the extent that one senses a conductor trying to convey the impression that it is his personal suffering, not the composer's vision, which is producing such beautiful music. <br />Not Solti's.  He and his incredibly virtuosic orchestra let Mahler do the talking.  The 5th, 6th and 7th especially lend themselves to Solti's approach, while the 8th benefits from his <br />long, successful career in the pit.  Though Karajan, Walter, Guilini and others have recorded great 9ths, I defy anyone to find a better played one than this.  Solti gives us the orchestral tours de force that are the Mahler Symphonies and which, I believe, explain why \\"my(his)time will(has) come.\\"
0060555661|4.0|I decided to read this book after reading a biography of Warren Buffet. I learned that Buffet was a student of Graham, so I was curious to learn more. I am not an expert, merely an average investor with basic knowledge. I have no plans to devise or follow an advanced investment strategy, and can't comment on whether you would be helped by reading this book if that is your goal. I did find it informative about one of the many schools of thought in the world of stock investing. It was worth reading for that reason. However, don't get this book if you want something that will be a breeze to read.  If you have a basic background and are ready for something more technical, give this book a try.  <br /> <br />It helps to be aware that the text consists partly of Graham's original early-twentieth century writings, with updates and commentary by a modern investment expert. Add loads of footnotes and citations, and you have more of a college text  than a popularized investment guide to tote to the beach.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNZJ|2.0|The movie has a very inconsistent story, it seems that they didn't consult with any futurists to create something remotely credible. The special effects are very unimpressive, it doesn't show anything worth mentioning.
B000BTJDGC|5.0|This is a great film from start to finish. But be warned it's not a blood and guts splatter film, so if that's what you're looking for, don't bother watching it. On the other hand, if you're looking for an entertaining, intelligent, suspenseful and at times down right spooky movie, then I can't recommend this one enough. As I said in my title, it's one of the best movies of the year.
0393327655|2.0|We can expect people of faith to take exception to a book called \\"The End of Faith,\\" as so many of the reviews below testify. That is not a surprise.    What is surprising is to find people who basically agree with Harris' position also expressing opposition and disappointment to this book. I add myself to that list. The central points Harris is making -- that it's about time religious faith be divested of its respectability and criticized squarely for what it is; and that religious faith in an era of nuclear and biological weapons may well kill us all -- these points are worth making. It's just that Harris does not make them very well.    The historical overviews of the inquisition and other Christian excesses are weak, superficial, and don't add much to the debate.  His chapter on Islam is close to risible. We get arguments like this: the problems of the Middle East have nothing to do with poverty, oppression, and tyrannical governments because, well, lots of other people endure these conditions and don't blow themselves up on buses. Ergo, only the tenets of Islamic faith can explain such atrocities. When you look at those tenets, you find the basis for Islamic cultural retardation. So, concludes Harris, Muslims are throwbacks to the 14th century.    This is laughably superficial. Robert Pape (in his book \\"Dying to Win\\") has demonstrated beyond a shadow of doubt, and from masses of carefully assembled data, that suicide terrorism is a strategic, military choice, not a product of religious fanaticism. No doubt, religious fanaticism enables suicide terrorism, but it is not its prime cause. Further, to answer Harris' argument, it could be pointed out that lots of Muslims live all over the world and don't blow themselves up. They don't do it in Qatar, or in Dubai or in the United Arab Emirates -- all affluent (and relatively open) societies. They don't do it in Syria or Jordan (at least, homegrown suicide bombers don't). They're all Muslims there, aren't they? What unites campaigns of suicide terrorism is *not* Islam. It's political conflict. It is fundamentally dishonest to argue otherwise.    The fundamental problem here is a failure to appreciate complexity. Harris argues monolaterally, offering a single, umbrella reason for all the problems of the Middle East. But those problems are horribly complex. Judaism, for instance, is not a religious faith. It's an ethnic identity, a nationalism, a way of life, and a faith all rolled into one. It's likely that a nexus of such factors stands behind the current mess, in which religious faith plays its part, no doubt. But it can't do all the heavy lifting for the woes of Middle East. There's more to it than that.    After these disappointing chapters, comes some seriously dubious argumentation: US-inflicted \\"collateral damage,\\" no matter how many are maimed or killed, cannot be equated morally with Al Qaeda depredations, since the intentions of the US are good. So, it seems, consequences needn't delay us long.  OK. I disagree, but Harris is entitled to his (incorrect) position. But then comes this: if we are prepared to accept inflicting civilian casualties as \\"collateral damage\\" in our wars, we have no moral basis to object to torture, which we should also accept, even if the victims might be innocent.    Wait a minute ... what happened to the cleansing effect of good intentions? Adopting Harris' position for the sake of argument, aren't we in very different moral territory inadvertently inflicting \\"collateral damage\\" than we are purposely strapping some poor bugger to a table and attaching electrodes to his genitals? Perhaps, if in doing the strapping, you have good intentions, then it's OK. This is an argument Josef Mengele would be comfortable with.    When we get to the end, there comes a crashing disappointment and a terrible realization. Harris is into meditation. He likes his Eastern mysticism. He attempts to justify the \\"rationality\\" of such mystical exploration, but things getvery ropey. He's not a dualist, but he's not a physicalist either. I think it highly dubious to put the mystical speculations of eastern yogi alongside the corpus of scientific exploration and claim that they are two sides of a single coin. Just put the test of achievement to each one: what, exactly, have millennia of mystical musings achieved, as opposed to a few centuries of the scientific enterprise? How have the mystics helped humanity? Scientific medicine has, in a single century, doubled the average life expectancy of the developed world. Given the political and economic will (so tragically lacking today), we could easily extend this benefit across the globe. Science has, literally, given us the gift of decades more life. What gift can the Krishnas claim to have bestowed in comparison? Getting in touch with the inner eye? I'll take the decades, please.    As one reads this section, one starts to suspect that Harris is not really about slamming faith-based claptrap because it's claptrap, but rather that he slams it because it's not the claptrap he approves of. He has his own favorite mumbo-jumbo (some of it quoted approvingly, when it makes no sense to the uninitiate).    It's a horrible moment.    The fundamental points Harris makes about faith need to be made. This isn't the book to make them.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|First off, I have only seen segments of the Liquid Television \\"Aeon Flux\\" animated episodes back in the 90's, so I'm not qualified to give an in-depth comparison to this movie. And two, I think politics should be left out of it...therefore I won't comment on Hollywood's left/right influence on this movie or anything like that. I'm reviewing it based on its merits alone and nothing else. <br /> <br />That out of the way, I found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be a dumbed-down, watered-down, yet entertaining version of the animated series. Although I have mentioned above that I didn't see that much of the original in the 90's, I saw enough of it to say that as usual, Hollywood has toned down the sex & violence so that it gets a safe, for-the-masses PG-13 rating. Fanboys of the original series are going to throw popcorn at the screen, and are advised to skip it. But for the rest of us, I suppose it's an adequate sci-fi/action brainless flick that doesn't challenge anyone and merely asks that one put their brain on neutral. <br /> <br />Although Charlize Theron is WAY too attractive for the role of Aeon and basically phones in her performance, she does a commendable job with what she is given to work with. A large part of this movie relies on her sex appeal and it never apologizes for it. And in all fairness it does have some other good qualities, mainly the special effects and futuristic set designs that are at least original even if implausible. Some work could have been done on the fight sequences, which were amateur and even boring at times.  <br /> <br />All in all, I recommend \\"Aeon Flux,\\" but only if you have some extra cash leftover and/or are a big fan of Charlize Theron (she is after all quite easy on the eyes in this movie). But if you're trying to save some money and want to limit your movie watching, give this one a pass and wait for \\"The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe\\" or \\"King Kong,\\" which will surely be light years better.
1400032717|5.0|As a mother with an autistic spectrum child, I absolutely loved this book, and cried at the ending and the protagonist's (Christopher Boone's) optimism.<br /><br />I have long since passed the stage of wanting my child to be \\"normal\\" (and in fact have strong thoughts about what \\"normal\\" means, but that is another story). Now, however, my deepest hope is that my child adapts to his unique challenges, and leverages his unique strengths, to make a meaningful life for himself.<br /><br />Christopher Boone does this in spades, hence my tears at the ending.<br /><br />The book's depiction of autism/aspergers syndrome rings extraordinarily true, based on the many children I know with autism (including my own).  This is not to say I know anyone who is precisely like Christopher - autism is a spectrum disorder, the symptoms and severity vary tremendously from person to person.<br /><br />The story line itself is quite interesting, Christopher tries to solve the mystery of a dog's murder, and in doing so, uncovers secrets in his past.  He also, through sheer power of reason and will, forces himself out of his comfort zone (a BIG deal for an autistic person) in order to solve the mystery.  This was, for me, profoundly moving.<br /><br />There is also a fascinating disconnect between the way Christopher responds to what he discovers, and the way the READER responds.  We are much more aware of the pain and unhappiness surrounding his situation than he is.<br /><br />As someone who worries a bit about what the future holds for my son, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised about the warm reception this book has received from the general public.  I find that incredibly encouraging, that so many others see and respond to the dignity and humanity in Christopher, instead of writing him off as a freak.  Thank you, Mark Haddon.
0393327655|1.0|The reviewers who panned this book are quite correct: it is fundamentally dishonest.  Ignoring historical and sociological perspective, Harris cobbles together a diatribe against \\"faith,\\" especially Islam, to pander to those who make the facile argument that Islamic faith is to blame for much that troubles our world today.  He's preaching to a large choir, of course, and that promises a best seller.
0440180295|5.0|Some people stay away from books that receive a lot of critical praise.  I'm not sure why, but if I had to guess I'd say they fear that it may be difficult to read or dry.<br /><br />You can't say either of those things about Vonnegut.  This book is the perfect introduction if you're not familiar with the author.  Not only is it humorous, but it's also concise and easy to read.  It's a book about war, but it never gets preachy.<br /><br />The plot deals with one character--Billy Pilgrim--who served in WWII.  When he comes home, he become an eye doctor and later claims to have been abducted by aliens.  The plot sounds a little crazy and hard to follow, but it all makes sense once you get into the book.<br /><br />Vonnegut and Hemingway share a trait that most readers should enjoy:  they are both precise and to the point.  There are very few wasted words and you don't get bogged down with long descriptions or flowery prose.  That's not to say that the story isn't well-written.  It's just written in a manner that most people will appreciate.
B000001FS6|3.0|U2 had been steaming forward with such tremendous momentum that they were bound to eventually miss a beat. With the near-unanimous critical and commercial success that was \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" they decided to try to document themselves and their tour. For the first time, their reach exceeded their grasp, as \\"Rattle and Hum\\" exposed a band willing to show all the warts. But those warts made for a pretentious film and a so-so album. This was the holding pattern that stayed in place till the band gathered their wits and reinvented themselves with \\"Achtung, Baby.\\"<br /><br />That is not to say that the soundtrack to \\"Rattle And Hum\\" is without merit. Indeed, \\"All I Want,\\" \\"Desire\\" and \\"When Love Comes To Town\\" are stunning in the way U2 absorbs American Music and spins it through their own portal. BB King on \\"When Love Comes To Town\\" is a particular highlight. But the choice of including Jimi Hendrix' \\"Star Spangled Banner\\" seems like an attempt to attach their genius by association, and with a band as brilliant as U2, comes off as arrogant at worst/misguided at best. Same with the not-all-too-inspired covers of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\" (even though Bono recently was quoted in Rolling Stone that he worships the White Album).<br /><br />The live tracks are also haphazard. \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\" (minus the Hendrix miscue) is stunning, and the gospel version of \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is definitive. But it also means you sit through a rough version of \\"Silver and Gold\\" with Bono taunting the crowd (\\"Am I bugging you? I don't mean to bug ya\\"). For a live CD, you're better served by \\"Under A Blood Red Sky.\\" So get this if you have to have it all, since the main three studio tracks appear on U2's greatest hits sets. I can't dismiss it, simply because U2 are probably the band that came out of the 80's that will have an enduring legacy, but there are better places to go if you're looking for a primer than \\"Rattle And Hum.\\"
0767903862|3.0|This is a very well written, very funny series of anecdotical comments regarding Australia.  Far from being a comprehensive armchair travel book, this book can hardly convey the true spirit and essence of Australia.  Bryson observations are very centered around the flora, fauna, and outdoors life but fails rather miserably at describing city life (apart from just some superficial commentary on museums). <br /> <br />Bryson has an obsession with the so-called dangerous nature of Australian insects and animals but forgets that no-one is really exposed to such dangers, unless you live in the outback (less than 3% of the population!). <br /> <br />In summarey, it is a nice, quick, easy read and very funny at times - but if you want to know about the true Australia in detail, then look elsewhere.
B0009OAV2E|5.0|I just read AMG's review of this great album, and decided to write a much needed rebuttal. AMG's review paints this beautiful music as \\"mawkish sentiment\\" & \\"weak\\", and I've heard others refer to this music as \\"saccharine\\". The truth is, however, that these are well written, well performed songs about love, peace & understanding. Unfortunately, in today's world, these great qualities are sometimes written off as rubbish. Yet these are the very thoughts/feelings that make life worth living! I'm not going to review the album song by song because it is beautiful from start to finish. I consider this to be one of Paul McCartney's best albums since his days with Wings & certainly one of the best collections of songs by any artist to come out in 1993. If you like Paul McCartney's work on records such as \\"Tug Of War\\", \\"Pipes Of Peace\\" or just about anything he's released in the 80's-90's then I think you'll like this one as well. Highly recommended listening, and well-worth the money for a truly high-quality album from one of the most talented recording artists of the last 40+ years!!! 'Nough said.
B00005JO1P|5.0|\\"Walk the Line\\" tells the story of country music star Johnny Cash from his early days until his marriage to June Carter in 1968. Joaquin Phoenix is terrific, capturing the mannerisms and singing style of Cash as well as any actor possibly could. Reese Witherspoon does a fine job as well. Her June Carter is a spunky, intelligent young woman who finally manages to provide Cash the solid grounding that he so desperately needs. <br /> <br />I especially enjoyed the scenes of Johnny's childhood. The movie really captures the simplicity and hardship of life in rural Arkansas at this time. This boyhood period also includes the tragic death of his older brother, Jack. Johnny's guilt over not being there to save his brother from a sawmill accident provides the psychological background for much of what happens later in the movie.   <br /> <br />The film's most prominent musical focus is on Cash's early days as a rockabilly artist, hanging out with Elvis, Jerry Lee Lewis and the boys. It's worth remembering that Johnny was a rebellious, young rocker before later returning to his country music roots. It was during these days that he first met and fell in love with June Carter. But she was newly divorced and he was still unhappily married. So they remained \\"only friends\\" for many years before admitting their passion and love for one another. But by this time Cash had become addicted to pharmaceutical drugs and June realized a successful marriage would be impossible. Finally, with the help of June and the Carter family, Johnny is able to quit taking the pills and get his life back on track. But, the now twice divorced, June is reluctant to marry again despite Johnny's desperate pleading. I found the ending, where June finally accepts Johnny's marriage proposal on stage to be improbable and a bit cheesy. But if that is how it really happened then that's how it had to be filmed. <br /> <br />Overall \\"Walk the Line\\" is a terrific film about two extraordinary people. The music is great and if you are a Johnny Cash fan you will love listening to it. Highly recommended.    <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BP86OG|4.0|Great Sweet Queen, wipe the Slade clean. Justin Hawkins and his bandmates in The Darkness have given us an exuberant reminder of why - when it was really great - the kind of arena rock that you loved in the 70's was fabulous. In fact, even the syrup-stringed ballad (\\"Seemed Like A Good Idea At The Time\\") isn't a total embarrassment. There's even a couple of hilarious one-offs to make sure you never forget that The Darkness can make light. You get \\"Knockers\\" (complete with the most outrageously funny second verse I've heard in years) and the ode to that middle-age scourge of crotch-rockers everywhere, \\"Bald.\\" (Hey, is this a knock at Rush? Remember \\"I Think I'm Going Bald\\"?)<br /><br />That is the beauty of The Darkness and \\"One Way Ticket To Hell...And Back.\\" This is serious rock by a bunch of guys who have no problem NOT taking themselves all that seriously. My main quibble with The Darkness remains that their voice is still not gone beyond a too-easily identified composite of other bands. You'll hear an awful lot of Sweet and Queen here, and dabs of Slade, Boston, AC/DC, Def Lep etc, and the final third of the CD loses momentum. But then, if you can muster up the charisma of Freddie Mercury and the harmonies of the mighty Sweet, as The Darkness does on the title cut and \\"English Country Garden,\\" I'm not going to be the one to tell you it's a bad thing. Add to the mix Roy Thomas Baker's usual kitchen sink approach to the production (sitar, bagpipes, pan flute, tubular bells and a pitch-perfect Brian May sound-alike opening guitar on \\"Hazel Eyes\\") and you can't help but get swept up in the ride. Besides, would any of the cocaine-cowboy bands of the seventies even dared to open their album with an anti-drug song AND the sounds of line-snorting?<br /><br />Best Songs\\" \\"One Way Ticket,\\" \\"Knockers,\\" \\"Hazel Eyes.\\"
B00005JNZJ|1.0|I am not a liberal, at least I don't think I am, but on some issues I am forced, reluctantly to side with the Christian right, like Hollywood.  It's not that I object to sex and violence, not at all, it's that I think that Hollywood has lost touch, in fact after viewing Aeon Flux I am doubtful they ever had a clue, who was this film aimed at?  Why was a considerable amount of money spent on this incredibly ill-conceived hodgepodge of boring action sequences, absurd psychobabble and endless camera pans leading nowhere, I scarcely know where to begin, what a lame, disappointing mess.  If you saw the previews you have no reason to waste 80+ minutes of your life watching Charlese Theron embarrass herself with stupid green screen stunts, example:  in the future, 2425 or something, our hero and some other girl whose hands have been transplanted to her feet (don't ask) decide to \\"sneak\\" into future city by running across a field and jumping over the wall, sounds clever, but the city planners decide to defend against such attacks by having some weird pineapple looking things shoot darts at them, note to would be city invaders, learn gymnastics, they help a lot in cases of massive pineapple dart attacks.  You see when said darts start flying, one just needs to do a lot of handsprings and crawl along real fast, then, somehow, you won't be hit.  Oh yeah and one should be sure to climb in the tree and point the shooting darts fruit at the other shooting dart fruit thereby getting the pineapples to shoot each other, just don't step on the grass that shoots up knife blades.  This is a boring retread of every \\"break into the bad guys secret hiding place\\" ever shot. This was a cult animated show that went off the air years ago for a reason, honest to God they should have had Charlese Theron playing Daria , I would have liked that a lot better.  As I entered the theater I saw a huge pile of posters sitting on the counter, I guess the theater personnel were hoping people would take them, they were free.  Really nice, high quality posters, the big ones, rich color, Charlene the hottie in her little Aeon Flux outfit.  I considered taking one on the way out....then I put it back.  I did not want to be the only one who took one, I have no doubt they are all still there, they should have left the film sitting out, but I doubt anyone would want that either.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|What lover of traditional jazz/Christmas songs wouldn't love this album?  Diana Krall captures the very spirit of Christmas for me because she has such wonderful vocal intonations...she makes words work the way the lyracists had hoped they would.  There isn't any glitz, no gimics, just Diana doing the same kinds of things that the greats have done with these same songs through the years.  The charts are wonderful.  The sentimental songs are sentimental; the fun songs swing...Diana does what Frank did with Chrismas songs!   <br /> <br />I just love the album art too! <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B0002S947K|5.0|I don't often take the time to review things and I'm especially hesitant at this one and I'll tell you why:  there just aren't many people like Ray that walk the earth and as much as he deserves endless success, part of me wants to selfishly keep him (his music) for myself.  I've had the album for some time now and have always recommended him to friends (many of which now own and love the cd) and I even sent it to my father for his birthday.  I figured he deserved a copy since he was the one who taught me what real music sounded like and that is what Ray represents: music in its purest form.  I just saw him perform an all acoustic set last night and it was unlike anything I ever saw...and I've been to many shows.  This was stripped down pure emotion, the vulnerability he transmits should hit a chord with anyone who has ever felt a human emotion.  He is tall, slender and somewhat frail and is obviously a man of few words but when he starts to sing (eyes full closed mind you - a sign of someone who is giving you something from a faraway place) this eruption of soul emanates.  It's as if the strength of his soul could feasibly rupture the frail exterior it is temporarily contained in.   I'm pretty sure he didn't need a mike to satisfy the ears of the few hundred that sat attentitively in their chairs at the small club.  He really shined when he went off on small tangents during several songs where the improvisation was as impressive as the prepared song.  Not only did I see something different but I felt I just saw something extraordinary...something that practically no one else in this day and age of manufactured music could ever hope to ascend to.  It's refreshing to see such honesty and humility in the form of a song.  I hope that I see and hear a lot more of Mr. Lamontagne although I wouldn't be surprised if he just disappeared in Robert Johnson fashion as I think his soul may have been sold in exchange for such unearthly talent.  Buy the cd, see him in person, seeand hear Ray for yourself, he won't disappoint.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|You can really tell that by the time that this album was released, Dream Theater was sounding more confident than ever before. They were also sounding particularly angry, and this has produced what most people consider to be Dream Theater's most heavy, agressive album to date. \\"Train of Thought\\" comes out of the gate with all arms swinging on \\"As I Am\\", and it doesn't relent to let those who are left behind to catch up.  <br /> <br />Lyrically, this is by far Dream Theater's darkest outing, with every song focusing on despair, death, loss, and other things that make our lives miserable. James LaBrie has done one of his best outings to date and does not oversing on this album, which is quite refreshing.  <br /> <br />Musically, Dream Theater is using all of their guns to produce the heaviest and most powerful album to date. Mike Portnoy in particular has never sounded better, which on it's own is quite a statement as to the talent on display here. Additionally, Jordan Rudess's keyboards sound very menacing and especially appropriate to Petrucci's master guitar work. While keeping everything nice and heavy, Dream Theater does a good job of keeping things melodic, and they never lose focus on the album that's at hand.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is one of the most powerful albums Dream Theater has released. Will everyone like it? No. But it's a great choice for anyone who is a fan of prog-metal, or old school metal.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|Shakira definitely did an amazing job with this album. I love every one of the songs on her New Oral Fixation II. I have been a Shakira fan since her early albums and in my opinion her talent has only improved. To those of you who don't know, Shakira has played the guitar since the beginning of her career, she is not \\"acting\\" to play the guitar as some of you think on her video \\"Don't Bother\\". I know it's hard to believe with all the other pop singers out there whose songs are written and played for them. Shakira actually writes her lyrics and collaborates with making the music happen (including playing the guitar) she's simply an artist with talent. <br />How do you do, Animal City and tImor are my favorites! I'm so glad she's back!
B000021XS0|4.0|Before I begin to go in depth about this album and my opionions about it, I must first explain that first and foremost, I am a fan of music - not just the prog scene, and I am a big fan of Dream Theater. With that being said, this is Dream Theater's most complicated and difficult album to date. That's not an insult to the album, if anything it is a compliment, but it's also a fair warning to you casual listeners out there. <br /> <br />From the distant perspective, this is not a work that should be approached from the stance of it being an album: it's really one song, a suite divided amongst 12 tracks for easier accessability. It's also played out a lot like an epic poem, a story that's sequencial to the \\"Images and Words\\" epic \\"Metropolis Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper\\". Sung in first person perspective, you experience the realization of Nicholas, who in dreams experiences the life of a little girl who was murdered many years ago. The story is complex and can be difficult to follow, but after a few listens they will make a lot more sense.  <br /> <br />It's not the lyrics that truly define what this album is though, it's the music. In many ways, the lyrics just play as a backdrop to a grandiose masterwork that John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy, John Myung, and newcomer Jordan Rudess have composed. In fact, in many ways this album feels as though it could be played as a complete instrumental. It's because of that this album tends to drag during the middle, as lead singer James Labrie seems to try to do too much, not staying within the context of the music. This flaw can be easily overlooked though, as this is a refreshing Dream Theater experience that will fondly be recalled as one of the greatest truly progressive albums of all time.
6304696515|5.0|<br />When I saw this movie on TV, the opening scene was actually the last scene of the DVD version. Who was the lady (Glenn Close) in the VIP box and what has she done to provoke such a unified response from the audience of the theatre? What followed was the retelling of her story and her infamous endeavours. <br /> <br />Marquise (Glenn CLose) was a stunning beauty, wicked and calculating, strong-willed and manipulating. What she called as a power of struggle between the sexes boiled down to a war for her to win all at all costs. She would rather declare victory over other women who might threaten her (or rather her vanity). People around her, played by John Malkovich,Michelle Pfeiffer, Swoozie Kurtz, Uma Thurman, Keenu Reeves, were all unknowingly her puppets. The one closest to knowing the truth (John Malkovich) was also her vehicle to carry out her vicious schemes and succumbed to her plot.   <br /> <br />This was a tragic story because it was a lose-lose-lose situation; everyone (including Marquise) was a victum in the end. True love was not rewarded. Neither vanity and happiness went to any of them. The movie offers fine performance of the star-studded cast and detailed costumes and sets. One of a kind.
B000002KHH|5.0|That's the main chorus line of the song, \\"Paranoid\\", if you're wondering what the title of this reveiw is about.  What can I say.  Led Zeppelin may have invented heavy metal but Black Sabbath took it to new levels.  Inserting lyrics and story lines regarding war, God, Satan, insanity, Armaggedon, and yes even drug abuse, Sabbath redefined what hard rock was about.  They proved that on the monolithic release, their self titled debut, \\"Black Sabbath\\".  But they didn't fully perfect their style untill they released this album. <br /> <br />The album never lets up during its forty minute duration.  It opens with the metal epic, \\"War Pigs\\", a creepy tale of how the governments of countries at war are punished by God.  Containing classic guitar work by Tony Iommi, this has become a staple of metal music.  \\"Paranoid\\", is a faster almost punk like track devoted to only one thing; insanity.  With its classic guitar riff and unforgettable lyrics you really feel as if your insane by the time the song is over.  \\"Planet Caravan\\", is a very moody almost beautiful ballad. certainly the quite point of the album.  Things then do a 180 with the track, \\"Iron Man\\".  Beginning with a slow string of guitar bends and then leading into the most recognizable guitar riff in the history of rock music.  Another strange song about a man who takes revenge on those he once saved the lives of.  They then turne him into some kind of robot hence the name iron man.  Then again the lyrics could just be utter nonsense with no meaning at all. <br /> <br />\\"Electric Funeral\\", is a nice, warm, child friendly tale about nuclear fallout and people who have been burned alive by radiation.  Once again, God comes to earth to set things right. <br />\\"Hand Of Doom\\", is a song about drug addiction, most notably heroin.  \\"Rat Salad\\", is a short instrumental featuring some incredible drum work by Bill Ward.  \\"Faries Wear Boots\\", is a comical song about a man who sees faries and dwarves while high on God knows what.<br /> <br />Now Metallica may have later took this formula and perfected even more so than Sabbath did but the thing that matters is that Sabbath started it all.  A landmark release in every way imaginable.  If you don't own this album then you really are paranoid!
B000002KET|5.0|This was one of my first introductions to Sabbath, often put off by the overtly `dark' vibes that seemed somewhat clich&eacute;d, I never really gave Sabbath much of a listen, that is until this album completely crushed my ignorance. This album is undeniably one of Sabbath's best, the sound is perfect and everything you'd want from a `classic' metal album. At times the band venture into a more synth-heavy sound, something a little more experimental than previous releases, but the relentless Iommi riffing and piercing screams of Ozzy are still there, and as good as ever.<br /><br />As mentioned above Sabbath ventured into new ground with a higher emphasis on synthesizers, for me it's hit and miss. The two songs that feature the synth most heavily are the dreamy `Who Are You?' and the fine closer `Spiral Architect', when listening to `Who Are You?' today, the synths are somewhat dated and become monotonous, while probably being rather cutting edge and `spaced-out' sounding in its day, its nothing special now, thus making the only weak song on the album. In sharp contradiction the use of synths on `Spiral Architect' is far subtler, instead of becoming the main feature it simply adds to the lush guitar and vocal melodies, the dreamy atmosphere really works here and provides a fine ending to the album.<br /><br />The rest of the music, except the short instrumental `Fluff', is pure guitar driven Sabbath at it's best. The title track opener is amongst their best work, the riffs are punishing while retaining a wondrous `groove' sense. `A National Acrobat' is another fine piece, much like the title track the song is split into two main sections, the latter section being a fine groove laden expedition of Iommi's distinguished riffing. `Sabbra Cadabra' is an instant winner, and deservedly one of Sabbath's most recognised pieces. My personal favourite on the album comes in `Killing Yourself To Live', the numerous riffs are all utterly compelling, especially the sinister chorus melody that accompanies Ozzy's wild screams. Once again the song takes a different direction creating another two section structure, the second part to `Killing Yourself To Live' is the perfect example of what groove laden metal should sound like, and what many of the modern era `stoner' bands try to re-create.<br /><br />This is a must have for any fan of hard rock/metal, Sabbath are undeniable metal heroes, and this album showcases their full armoury.elody that accompanies Ozzy's wild screams.

1577314808|5.0|This book is the best of its kind with respect to embracing the present moment.  Written from a spiritual perspective, this book builds peace and joy.  Eckhart Tolle believes that we need to detach from the past, recognize that it is just a memory, and stop robbing ourselves of living life fully in the here and now.  He believes that if we don't forgive past hurts, we are resisting life in the present moment.  This sure made sense to me.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|The first time I saw this movie a few years ago, I really didn't like it. I was left extremely confused; I felt there wasn't a point to the movie and it went nowhere, throwing random scenes and characters in for no apparent reason. <br /> <br />I've watched it around 5 more times since then, including just last night, and have grown to love it. It is such an intriguing film - almost impossible to not be completely captivated by.  <br /> <br />Donnie Darko (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a disturbed teenager (I use the term \\"disturbed\\" very, very lightly) who seems to not fit in with society and begins to see a man in a bunny suit (\\"Frank\\") who claims that the world will end in less than a month. Throughout the month, Frank tells Donnie to commit various acts such as flooding the school and burning down one man's house.  <br /> <br />What makes this movie difficult to understand is that everything isn't explained completely. Even at the end of the movie, you're still left puzzled, but definately not as much as throughout. Donnie was supposed to die at the beginning of the movie because of a jet-engine crashing into his bedroom that appeared from a worm-hole from one month in the future. Frank's claim that \\"the world will end in less than a month\\" makes it Donnie's 'mission' to stop that from happening. By the end of the movie, despite Frank's efforts, Donnie goes back in time and changes the path Frank took him on during the month, inevitably 'saving the world', however not in the sense that the world will explode or something equally as ludicrous. It's more like he's saving society from their own ignorant destruction of life in general. As you watch the movie, you'll begin to see how foolish and close-minded Donnie's peers and school teachers are, as they value all the wrong things in life. <br /> <br />I still don't understand every detail from the movie, but watching it multiple times really does help. I wouldn't say I am drawn to movies about time travel, but I have alwaysliked all the \\"Back to the Future\\" movies and used to watch \\"Quantum Leap\\" on TV a lot. I enjoy movies that have deeper meanings, symbolism, hidden themes, and in \\"Donnie Darko\\"'s case, movies that don't waste my time with unncessary dialogue and action.  <br /> <br />If you liked \\"Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind\\" and/or are attracted to the sounds of this deep - albeit twisted - film surrounding time travel, I would highly recommend this movie.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I was out of the loop when it came to Miss Peyroux. O.K., I wasn't entirely out of the loop -- I knew tangentially that she was supposed to be this jazz phenom with a voice like Billie Holiday. And that's exactly why I never ventured to purchase her albums. I see comparisons to Miss Holiday and I instantly think of Lisa Ekdahl who was supposed to be Sweden's answer to Billie Holiday. NOT! (To her credit, \\"Now or Never\\" was decent, but I digress....) <br /> <br />I grabbed this album on impulse, wondering all the while if I had lost all my senses. Let me tell you, I was dead wrong about Madeline Peyroux. She is the real deal. Yes, there are similarities to Billie and hints of Ella, but she is nevertheless her own unique singer. And what a singer she is. Her voice is as smooth and rich as aged single-malt scotch over ice. Her phrasing is dead-on. There isn't a single clunker on the album. Needless to say, I'm eating crow and ordering her debut album, coughing up feathers all the while.
0743454537|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  The charcters feel like people you know, that is what makes the rest so devistating. <br /> <br />The plot of this book reads like a hypothetical from a bioethics class, sister who was designed to be a genetic match for an ill sister wants to make her own decision about donating a kidney.  That alone would cause you to think.   <br /> <br />The beauty of this book is that it makes you both think and feel, to deal with the reality that these decision are about people, not hypotheticals. <br /> <br />Read it, no matter what you might think going in, this book will  challange that idea.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I don't really the rating system here, but I couldn't have given American Life a 3 when I gave Music a 4 and Erotica a 3 also. Those two albums go in a nice direction, whereas American Life is one very rocky ride. It seems that this is one of her most reviewed albums on here and I can certainly see why. Let me say that I love Madonna; I'm a fanatic. But I also know good music, and overall, this album is her weakest in the whole catalog. The thing about American Life is that is very listenable, but you are kind of left wanting more and thinking of ways the songs could have been better. The disc seems to be part of some kind of spiritual awakening trilogy, where Madonna discusses her new life as mom, heroine, and refugee from the material world. It worked best on 'Ray of Light', it was tolerable on 'Music', here it's just tired. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" kicks a killer groove, but as far as the message goes, Madonna isn't telling us anything we didn't already know. \\"I don't watch TV/I don't waste my time reading magazines,\\" she proclaims. Ambiguity goes a long way here, on other songs such as \\"Intervention\\"; what is she saving her baby from? It might be a better song if there was something happening here!Yeah that's nice honey, but what else you got in your bag of tricks? Also a problem with this song and many others is Madonna's increasing problem with lyrics. On \\"Nobody\\" she says, \\"I'm not that kind of guy/sometimes I feel shy...\\" Ick. And what about that awkward rap in \\"American Life\\". I'm not sure if she meant it to be serious or cute, but when you rap about soy lattes and mini coopers, Ritchie we have a problem! In the \\"Oh Father\\"-esque \\"Mother and Father\\", she calls her father a \\"jerk\\" for having to go to \\"work\\" and after her mother's death all she did was \\"sit and cry...cry and cry and cry all day until the neighbors went away\\". Now I like the thumping digi-disco beats in the song, but how can we take it seriously with lyrics like those? Or are all the Madonna fans just supposed to keep dancing to keep from rolling on the floor laughing? Trust me, fellow Madonna fans, I'm not making fun of her by any means, but I think anyone can see that on 'American Life' there is much room for improvement. So the title of the album is 'American Life' and judging by its content its Madonna's american life and not ours. Where 'Erotica' was hardly about sex at all, 'American Life' is not about the state of the world, but the state of Madonna's world. The only real statement she is making is with her military get up in the artwork and the controversial \\"American Life\\" video. Where is a song about her frustration over the Bush administration? Where is there talk about anything other than the downside to celebrity living? Whatever Madonna was striving for, we're not sure. It is a rather intriguing album once you get past all of that. In between all the kinks and bugs, there is pretty good production in \\"Hollywood\\", where Madonna warns that there is a dark side to such a seemingly perfect place. She never tells us why it's bad, but we listen just the same and get into the groove. There's \\"I'm So Stupid\\" that snatches \\"Everybody's looking for something\\" from the Eurthymic's \\"Sweet Dreams\\". There is an odd charm to this song, however immature it may seem. A lot of the songs hardly seem like the work of someone Madonna's age, but for a woman who uses various aspects of culture to launch a \\"new statement\\" in her always anticpated releases, songwriting often plays second fiddle. But as we have seen in the past on such records as 'Ray of Light' and 'Like a Prayer', Madonna has the ability to counter the pop trend of the moment with meaningful writing. For Madonna fans and fans of music alike, we all appreciate an artist for different reasons. I don't base my love for Madonna strictly on songwriting. It's the whole package. Hr transformations, her business savvy, and her boldness have all played a part in it for me over the years. But on 'American Life' I can't ignore what i hear. Thats not to say I hate the album and never play it. It takes a spin more often than most of my CDs do and it has it;s own niche in my Madonna collection. It just stands in the shadows of albums just like 'Ray' and 'Prayer'. What is consistent about the album, is that is self-referential. \\"Mother and Father\\" is a sort of continuation of \\"Oh Father\\" without really accomplishing much. \\"Nothing Fails\\" is one of my favorite songs on the disc, but its religious theme and blurred line between sex and God is nowhere near as sensual and beautiful as it's older sister \\"Like a Prayer\\", which also contains a choir. The big standout is \\"Die Another Day\\" from the latest Bond flick, and although rabid fans already had the single, most would admit they were relieved when they learned it was part of the spotty track list. It's orchestral/techno wave is slick, fun and clever. It's one of the few songs on here that showcase what Madonna is best at: juxtaposing between fiery dance goddess and awakened den mother. Here she sounds like an adult, doing battle against the world and herself. It's triumphant as it plays against songs where she falls short of her true talent. Whatever that talent is, it's Madonna's secret formula. It's worked for decades, but this time the package is missing some weight.
B000BP86OG|5.0|ok, William Merrill \\"eclecticist\\" , wtf is up with you Hitler fans, who refuse to let people listen to their own kind of music.  Just because I don't find rap to be very musical, does that give me the right to critisize its listeners.  If you don't like it, ok.  If you want to right a bad review, ok.  But to say people who like it have no taste is just plain stupid.  And back to my actual post, If you did not like The Darkness's first cd, I would not recommend this one. I for one, loved the cd and the different approach this band has made in music.
B000AM6MKU|5.0|This movie with it's beautiful animation tells a wonderful story about believing in Christmas and in most importantly, believing in ourselves. A simple enough story for children of all ages to understand yet emotionally powerful to bring out the child in all of us.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|For nearly a year, I've had to endure siblings and friends quoting this movie and breaking into uncontrollable fits of laughter, so I finally decided I had to see it too so that I might laugh along. From the opening scene, things looked mildly promising. Napolean, the nerdiest, sleepiest-looking high-schooler you've ever seen hops on a school bus where another kid asks, \\"Napolean, what are you going to do today?\\" Napolean replies \\"Whatever I feel like -- GOSH!\\" with a little jerk of his head. Then he pulls a plastic figurine from his pocket, ties a string around its neck, and lowers it out of the window, letting it drag along the ground behind the bus. All right, I thought, this is going to be one of those screwy comedies full of eccentric characters who do random things. I was prepared for that, but I wasn't prepared for the 90-minute borefest that ensued. With no real plot to speak of, and characters that just aren't that likeable or interesting, I found myself longing for the movie to be over only a few minutes into it. I stuck it through in the hopes that it would improve, but no such luck. As far as comedes go, the humor in this one is quite subtle, and consistent in style throughout. If you like the first ten minutes, you'll probably enjoy the rest of the movie. If after ten minutes you find it isn't your cup of tea, stop there--it doesn't get any better. <br /> <br />I was tempted to give only one star, but I felt like being a little generous, perhaps because after suffering through this movie, I finally can understand references to it (those \\"Vote for Pedro\\" bumper stickers and tee-shirts, my family's quotes, and Heder's recent appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was quite funny after seeing this film). Apparently, this is a film you either love or hate. I can't stand it. If you have not yet seen this move, I'd recommend borrowing it or renting it before buying.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is the most underrated movie ever!  It was brilliant! Thought, why not check it out after reading reviews, bought the movie and have watched it several times already.
0385486804|4.0|After recently reading book 1 of Cervante's 'Don Quixote', and just today finishing Krakauer's 'Into the Wild', I am struck by the similarities between the real-life Chris McCandless and the fictional Don Quioxte.  Both read into their their favorite books too much and in their minds (and daily lives) the fiction becomes a reality.  Quixote has his knight-errants, McCandless has his isolationists.  Both are in a constant search for 'adventure'.  Both assume pseudonyms.  Both are repeatedly warned that their actions are irrational. Sancho Panza tells Quixote the windmills are not monsters.  Jim Gallien tells McCandless his provisions are too little to survive.  There are many more examples from both.  But, alas, both of the 'adventure seekers' ignore the warnings and plunge headlong into their fantasies.  Quixote gets beat up and bruised every time, McCandless ends up dead.  Sadly, both shun their families and keep them in a constant state of sadness and hope for a return.   <br />    <br />It's also important to note that both characters were not stupid people.  Don Quixote repeatedly amazes people with his penetrating insights and deep levels of understanding when talking of everyday, real life issues and enjoys the respect of his community.  McCandless is a brilliant college gradute that also enjoys the respect of his community.   <br />   <br />I think McCandless's life of journies was not bad (at least, unlike Quixote, he didn't physically hurt others), it's just that he was too stubborn to learn the proper way to lead a healthy existence in the wild.  Krakauer points out that McCandless survived for several months on his own and essentially made only one, albeit fatal, mistake.  I pose this question: what would have happened had he not found the bus?  He didn't know there a bus out there to live in.  His journal entry the day he finds the bus states \\"MAGIC BUS!\\"  He didn't have a tent, warm enough clothes, a grill to cook his meat on.  All that was in the 'magic bus'.  <br />    <br />As for a review of the book, I give it four stars because it definately is a page turner and it sucks you in whether you like the protaganist or not (I do like McCandless, he seemed like an very nice person to know--he was just too stubborn...).  I do recommend just checking it out from the library--it's a quick read.  I'm a slow reader (it took me a month and a half to get through book 1 of Don Quixote!), but I checked this book out at 5pm yesterday and returned it this morning.  It only gets four stars because the book reads just like the magazine article--you could just read that if you're only interested in McCandless.  Read the book to get Krakauer's fascinating tale of his own attempt at climbing the frightful 'Devil's Thumb' near Petersburg, Alaska.
B000002J09|4.0|Led Zeppelin IV (ZOSO) was released in 1971 and is Led Zeppelin fourth studio album.    Led Zeppelin established Themselves as champions of Rock N' Roll in the late 60s/early 70s. Their first two albums were groundbreaking for Rock music. There were many other bands in that time, but it was Led Zeppelin who played raw, furious blues-rock that shook the world. After controversial \\"III\\" the band released album that is regarded as their finest hour and creative peak.     My personal opinion for ZOSO is that this album is solid, but it's not perfect. I would not call it Led Zeppelin best by any means. Even though there are great classics here, a couple of songs are just decent.     The album opens with a hardrock note - Black Dog, excellent rocker, delivers amazing riffing from Jimmy Page and immortal lines from Robert Plant \\"Hey Hey Mum, said the way You move...\\". Easily one of Led Zeppelin finest moments. Rock N' Roll follows next, the title describes perfectly what the song is about. Loud and fast, though not as strong as Black Dog, it's another Zepp classic. Here we have a change of pace: Battle of Evermore is soft, mellow and experimental acoustic tune that works pretty well, but this song is nothing special. Not a filler, but a decent one.  Stairway To Heaven - Do I really need to explain on this one? Ah, I will say something on this one actually. Easily one of the best songs ever written. Pure magic. Haunting acoustic melodies played by Page are amazing. Plant shines on his vocal performance here. The song builds up, and at the end it is finished by piercing and dramatic guitar riffing with crying Plant vocals. Absolutely awesome piece.   Unfortunately, the album slips here. Awful Misty Mountain Hop is next. I don't know exactly why, but I hate this song. It is repetitive, and overall it sounds silly. Lame.  It gets a bit better on Four Sticks - this song is an experimental tune, and it's basically about drumming (John Bonham uses four sticks on the drums). It'sinteresting, but overall nothing special. Going To California is strong point of the album. Sweet and beautiful acoustic ballad. Charming guitar work and incredible vocal performance.   Everybody seems to praise When The Leeve Breaks so much - I always tried to understand what's so amazing about this song - for me it's just endless, repetetive blues. Nothing great definately, loooooong as hell, and not so interesting.     Overall - Overrated album, but still great. Though there are couple of decent tunes here, the rest is worth checking out. Recommended.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|While listening to this CD it becomes obvious that Mr Clapton is in a much happier place these days, and I'm honestly happy about that. Though that can influence some guys to write great music it seems to not be the case with this one, at this point in time.   I bought this without hearing it first, a major no-no of mine for obvious reasons, and once again I have been taught why that's never a good idea.  If you've enjoyed bluesy, guitar heavy tunes of Eric's in the past, you won't find even one of them here. The guitar work is mixed in there somewhere but only rarely does it stand out.   In my humble opinion, with the exception of the first song, the entire thing, well... stinks. I wish him the best with it though. Maybe it'll strike a chord with somebody else.
B0000012V4|5.0|It took amazon ages to release this excellent Rigoletto but now it's here and it offers one of the warmest accounts of this opera.  <br /> <br />Fischer-Diskau is far from a Verdian baritone but this role more than any other allows different interpretations and somehow his most sympathetic characterisation made me care for Rigoletto. It's pleasant that he can't bark like others but he can't be the nasty Rigoletto we should be introduced to in the beginning of the work either. Lets say that he's a good alternative to the classic Cappuccilli, Bastianini, Merrill, Bruson.  <br /> <br />La Scotto is heard here in her signature role and she surely doesn't dissapoint. Even if I can't endure her metallic voice for long, it's hard to deny the singing is exceptional. I'd compromise with her sound and vote for her as the best Gilda if it wasn't for Mariella Devia who offers everything Scotto does plus a creamy, focused top.  <br /> <br />This was the recording that introduced me to Bergonzi's magic. When he completed parmi veder le lagrime, I couldn't believe what I'd just heard. It sounds asif he distils Verdian essense from every single note the duke sings. And honeyed tone makes the experience a dream. I wonder why Maddalena didn't fall for him too! Cossotto and Vinco splendidly sing their minor but important parts and give an extra polish to the ensembles.  <br /> <br />Kubelik deserves the praise he gets for he offers drama, force and lyricism and controls the Scala forces even in the difficult parts. Don't miss it!

0553801503|1.0|Technically, I suppose Feast is still head and shoulders above most SciFi/Fantasy novels. Martin's nothing if not a master. But it's as if he's taken all the most boring/nasty/extraneous characters and boring/nasty/extraneous subject matter from the series, and built the whole book around it. Interminable politicking, interspersed with gratuitous violence and implausible subplots. More important than the literary flaws, on the other hand, is the fact that it's a slap in the face for Martin's faithful fans. I can't remember when I was as angry at a writer I admire as I was when I reached the last chapter of Feast and found out (spoiler alert) that after making us wait for years beyond the original announced date for this book, Martin decided to milk the situation even further by saving the most important plotlines for yet another volume. One of the reviews I read said that those who had been following his web page were prepared for this, but I gave that up ages ago when all I ever found there was the announcement of yet another delay. So I galloped through Feast on tenterhooks waiting to find out the fate of my favourite characters, all in vain. I would have waited for the paperback if I'd known. The postscript says the next and supposedly final book will be out next year. Yeah, and if you believe that, you'll believe anything.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|This movie reminds me of the British comedy \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", except this story takes place in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The movie is actually several stories which are intertwined with each other. Hugh Grant plays the newly appointed Prime Minister who falls for a female member of his staff. I love the part where Hugh dances to the Pointer Sisters song \\"Jump\\". Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman are a couple whose marriage is on the rocks. Liam Neeson is a recent widower with a young son who is lovesick for a girl in his class. Colin Firth looses his girlfriend to his brother but finds his true love while he is away on holiday. Kiera Knightly is a newly wed who finds out her husbands best friend is in love with her. Billy Bob Thorton makes his appearance of the president of the United States reminiscent of Bill Clinton. Bill Nighy portrays an aged rock and roller attempting his comeback with the song \\"Christmas Is All Around.\\" The movie is full of British wit and humor. If you like \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" you will love \\"Love Actually\\".
B000BJS4OY|5.0|Hello Boss Fans!<br /><br />I have been waiting for a  digital deluxe edition of this classic album for years, well, the wait is over, but man oh man, is this sounding great. The Boss rules, we all know that, but wait to you hear the crispness of the horns on Tenth Avenue Freeze Out, the opening Fender Telecaster strumming on She's The One, which you never really heard in the original mix, incredible nuances througout are awaiting the listener.<br /><br />The title track, Born To Run, sounds justlike the first time I heard it on WMMR in Philly, when my late friend Ed Sciaky broke the song, and this artist to a enthusiastic Philadelphia audience.<br /><br />I used to see Bruce play everywhere in those days, most memorable where the five nights at the Tower to help promote the release of this stunning album.  Ed Sciaky actually scored me tickets and I went to the show, and saw Bruce and The E Street band jump on Ed as he was doing pre announcements on the stage.  I still remember those great concerts, and this new edition delivers some really great memories.<br /><br />Bruce is the executive producer of this box set, and his musical ears and insight into this extensive project really will captivate the fans and first time buyers.<br /><br />Philly fans,you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Philly Joe from Friday Music
B000BP86OG|4.0|\\"Who the hell produced this album should be shot?\\" Are you kidding me?!? Only one of the greatest producers of all time! So it sounds like queen, duh, so what! Queen was a great band. If you are a fan of hate rock with gravel vocals with drummers on crack double kicking like a gerble on speed-don't buy this album. If you like fun rockl wiht melody and harmony, like the GOOD rock music of yore then this is a good 2nd effort indeed and you will like it. Give it multiple listens and it definately grows on you. These guys will be loved and equally hated as most really good bands are. Cheers to the Darkness for not bowing down to the dreadful current music trends. PS these guys are AMAZING live go see them.
0062502182|5.0|The book is about a boy realizing his destiny. It is a very short and easy read but it still a book that should be read for all the wisdom that is contained in it. For example, there are many little memoriable quotes your find inside the book like, \\"One is loved because one is loved. No reason is needed for loving,\\" or       \\"There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure.\\"     The story is entertaining and adventurous and with all the great wisdom inside, the book deserves a 5 star.
B000819PKC|5.0|`Dynamite' by UK group Jamiroquai lives up to its title. Right from the fuzzy bassline of the retro funk opening track `Feels just like it should', the funk/disco `Dynamite' with a Chic-like bassline, the retro disco sound of `(Don't) give hate a chance' with its why can't we live together sentiment, it is largely geared to get you exploding on the dancefloor.<br /><br />Other standouts include `Time won't wait' a disco tune urging one to make something of one's dreams as time won't wait for you (available on the UK version), the midtempo folk/funk of `Seven days in sunny June', and the funk/disco of `Starchild'.<br /><br />Not everything is upbeat though, there's the lilting horn drenched jazzy `Talullah' and the melodramatic piano ballad `World that he wants'.<br /><br />There's the rock/pop `Black devil car' with a gentle poppy intro leading to raging electric guitars in the chorus. Great!<br /><br />With their blend of funk/disco/jazz/soul, Jamiroquai's music has always evoked a faint image of 70s Stevie Wonder, and this album is no different. Brilliant!
0517548232|3.0|Being an Economic and Philosophy student both, I found this book intriguing.  I set out to kill two birds with one stone, however found myself rather surprised. While it applied to economics and taught and reiterated my class at school, it really drove home the ideas of philosophy. This book related to my philosphy and critical thinking class, because Henry Hazlitt makes a claim in the first chapter of the book and the following twenty five are the lesson being applied in economic terms.  He makes sure you understand and can apply his claim/lesson to the real world, all while showing you the faults many economist make.  All of his supporting stories are relevant and make since, they are all clearly written making sure his own view is shown, and they are complete, taking into consideration all points of view.     <br /> The book points out the fallacies of claims made by economists, and in doing so teaches you economics, and how to think correctly as one. He does not, however, take a typical approach to this economics thing.  He throws you right in and teaches you the lesson right away.  His lesson asks you to remember one thing.  <br />  \\"The art of economics consists in looking not merely at the immediate but at the longer effects of any act of policy; it consists in tracing the consequences of that policy not merely for one group but for all groups.\\"  <br /> This claim was something I was taught in my economics class, and I gladly related to it while reading. Some of my favorite chapters had to do with the broken window fallacy, minimum wage laws, and the mirage on inflation. All breaking down the faults of our government and the faults in our reasoning. Every chapter in the book brings home the main message of looking past the up front realities. To look outside of the box.    <br /> I felt Hazlitt took on a fair view of the people.  He stated many times,\\"if we have trained ourselves to look beyond immediate to secondary consequences.\\"  I think this applies to many people. The word if leaves it open, covering all individuals.  He also puts in his lesson, \\"not merely for one group but for all groups.\\" He does look at it for all groups, mentioning all people who would feel the effects of whatever program is put into place.  <br /> I honestly liked reading the book. If you are an economics or philosophy major, both of which I am not, the book is worth more closer review.  I would recommend it to anyone looking to find faults or learn economics.
B00005JO1J|4.0|I was thrilled when I got to see this on Broadway last year, and I would have to say that Columbus did a pretty good job of getting things right.  The movie does have flaws, of course - most of the cast does appear to be far too old for their roles, but they all turned in strong performances in the end.  There's also a scene with Roger (Adam Pascal) in the desert in New Mexico that brings Bon Jovi to mind, but the rest of the movie remains strong with most of the original cast.  The new additions (Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thoms as Mimi and Joanne respectively) were possibly better than the cast I saw on stage.  Rosario Dawson was killer in her role.  If you can't get to Broadway to see RENT, this movie does a fine job of hitting the nail on the head.
B000003TA4|1.0|I cant understand why anyone would like this band. I know the music is good but since whne was the music important? We all know that how many solos you can cram into a song and how high your singer can sing are way more important than the music. Just look at Eddie Van Halen. Sure his music sucks ass, but who cares as long as he plays five minute solos in every single song.
B000002NJS|5.0|I find it hilarious that self-absorbed and so called \\"real\\" electronic music fans dislike this album.  If your into electronic music and you hate madonna, there is something seriousely wrong there.  The woman was hand programming 303's while most of you were still in diapers or probably not even born yet.  This album did what every other electronic act failed miserably at, blending emotion with machine.  And the results speak for themselves.  BTW, theres alot more electronic fans that love this and other madonna albums, rather than hate it.  I have been a part of the Detroit electronic music scene for over 13 years and I know when to give credit where credit is due.  Madonna is our god-mother,...show a little respect.
B000BP86OG|5.0|For those rabid Darklings out there (like myself), this album is a much anticipated release.  It was well worth the wait!  This is rock solid music with each offering worthy of being a single release.  The music stands on its own merits.  Often second album releases don't live up to the expectations but \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...and Back\\" is the exception.  I have played my copy almost constantly and I'm eagerly anticipating seeing these guys back in action live. Bring on Justin and the catsuits!
0064471047|2.0|\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" did not ignite any excitement within me.  I had no expectations for this book, so luckily, I have not been let down in one form or another.  I am not fond of mystical/fantasy books, and I could not get caught up within this world of Narnia.  I found the action to be lacking, as it was described in short paragraphs, rather than shown, and I did not see any point to it. It is written very juvenilely, so it is easy to read.  I did think the end was rather clever, but it did not faze me enough to read the rest of the series.   I do not recommend.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I thought \\"what the hell?\\" when I first listened to this CD, mainly because the songs were just different.  Like \\"The Noose\\" and \\"Blue\\".  So at the first listen i thought the CD was \\"eh\\".  But then i listened to it again.  And again and then again and that's when i realized : WOW this is one AWESOME CD!!! \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Noose\\", \\"Blue\\", \\"Vanishing\\", \\"A Stranger\\", \\"The Outsider\\", \\"Pet\\" and \\"Gravity\\" all grew on me so much that I couldn't even go one day without listening to each of them.  The songs ARE different, and that just makes the CD so interesting.         Knowing what the whole CD is about helped me to like it even more. Thanks to reading another review on this page, I learned about the 12-step recovery program of getting over an addiction.  Knowing this really helped me to tie the songs together and know what they were about.        The only negative thing about A Thirteenth Step.... \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Lullaby\\".  I wouldn't even consider them *songs*.  Though they do add signifigance to the CD...they're really boring and dull to listen to.  But that's really nothing to dwell about because the rest of the CD is SO GREAT : )
B000000XB9|5.0|If you met an alien from another planet who asked you to play for him an example of something he heard about called \\"rock and roll music\\" then THIS IS WHAT HE SHOULD HEAR! <br /> <br />Most of the songs here, without question, are among the greatest performances in the history of American popular music. <br />This collection is great, but if you have the money and space, it's also worthwhile to buy all of the original studio albums. <br />Either way, EVERYONE MUST HAVE THESE SONGS!
B000002JS6|5.0|The sad and sudden death of AC/DC frontman Bon Scott would leave the band in a vary precarious situation.  With their popularity on the rise, coming of the mega-successful Highway To Hell, what were they going to do now that their lead singer had drank himself to death? (Hear Ozzy's Suicide Solution as an ode to Scott).  Well...they went out and picked up a geezer off the streets that they'd seen performing in the pubs by the name of Brian Johnson.  Thus Back In Black is born.  The quintessential AC/DC album.  On the list of biggest selling albums of all time and for one specific reason: it rocks!  Are the songs juvenile and chock-full of teeny-bopper sexual innuendos?  Hell, yes!  But this is metal in 1980 and the AC/DC boyz weren't exactly Ivy League material.  There are gems here, staples of modern rock.  Hells Bells which is used at every sporting event in America at one time or another.  Back In Black, You Shook Me All Night Long, Shoot To Thrill, & More.  This is the s*it!<br /><br />Dig it!
B000021YQV|4.0|As usual, SoaD brings it straightforward with hidden meanings only YOU can come up with. Innovating the new diverse genre considered \\"System of a Down\\" here comes the second album. Here's the lineup:    1. Prison Song:  8/10    The original SoaD feel that A.D.D. from \\"Steal this Album\\" gives you  2. Needles: 8/10    A great transition with many feelings  3. Deer Dance: 10/10    Sad song with a deep deep meaning  4. Jet Pilot: 5/10     somewhat a continuation from Deer Dance  5. X:  7/10:     World overpopulation... get the picture?  6. Chop Suey!: 10/10     Considered overrated, but this song has a lot packed into it, disassociated with the title, but carries a religious message with it.  7. Bounce:  6/10     ...  8. Forest: 8/10     Creepy, hard to figure out a meaning  9. Atwa: 7/10     Soft to thrashing as in the modern \\"Question\\" by later SoaD  10. Science: 9/10     NOT techno at all, still metal but expresses an almighty in a unrageful way. Beautiful  11. Shimmy: 7/10     Short, but sweet, you may have heard it on THPS4  12. Toxicity: 9/10     This is what I call a rock ballad  13. Psycho: 6/10     Mistaken for \\"Honest Mistake\\", this song is one of my least favorites  14. Aerials: 10/10     I just love the lyrics, don't get the last part    I play this CD over and over, and it never gets old. This is definitely worth buying.    System of a Down is for a specific taste, and that taste fits right in my mouth, it varies from soft to hard metal and if you're human, you'll like it.
0380788624|3.0|This is my second Neal Stephenson book (The Diamond Age was my first).  I cannot express how disappointed I am in the books' endings.  He is such a imaginative, funny and intelligent writer you would expect him to be able to write that one last chapter or two.  It is comparable to Lucas stopping the Star Wars Trilogy at The Empire Strikes Back.  You have been warned.
0684824906|5.0|<br />Who would have thought that a book about dear old Abe would have relevance today?  Talk about history repeating itself. Unfortunately. What was the major political issue of the time? The same theme that present day Civil War buffs argue about- ie. was the fight about union or slavery? There was not much agreement in the camps and Lincoln's greatness was to keep both on his side. Lincoln's political alacrity is an aspect few people realized- then or now. My favorite vignette: Abe at age 6 or 7 listening to adult stories around the fireplace and then translating them into kid-speak so that he could take the stump and charm the neighborhood. This skill served him well all his political life. Lincoln was also very patient always with a constructive motive. Example, his Secretary of the Treasury-Chase entertained the strong desires of becoming President and inflicted upon Lincoln often severe open criticisms to the public. These criticisms were vicious and many times exaggerated only to grace a better appearance for Chase. This was consummated with Chase resignation delivered on four separate occasions with all four times Chase assuming he was too important to be allowed to leave Lincoln's cabinet. But finally his welcome was outgrown its usefulness and Lincoln unexpectantly allowed him to leave the administration. The first 200-300 pages of the book are the strongest and most engrossing; once we get past the Emancipation Proclamation there's much less to mine that hasn't been dealt with before. Still, it's a wonderful book and required reading for any Lincoln buff. <br />
0062502182|4.0|Coehlo's \\"The Alchemist\\" has achieved the well deserved status of being categorized as an \\"important\\" novel to those in the literary know.  The book is short, simple and endearing and it undoubtedly one of the leaders in the \\"inspiration\\" genre.  It's simplicity is its strength and the story would serve in probably any medium including the lost art of verbal storytelling. <br /> <br />When thinking about what made this book \\"important\\", a few thoughts came to me.  First, the book has to has achieved some sort of notoriety/popularity and this book passes that criteria.     Some non-regular readers have heard of or read this which is a good litmus test for noteriety.  Second, this book is extremely readable.  It is brief but engaging and written in the simplest of prose.  People who never read can pick this up without intimidation and take something away from the experience without needing an English Ph.D.  Any book that inspires non-readers to read has a certain societal importance in my book, regardless of the quality.  Be it the elderly, successfull buisness people, recovering addicts, athletes, kids or whoever...this book can appeal to all.  Of course this can have the opposite effect and many experienced readers have called this book overly simplistic and pointless and I can see where are they are coming from which is why I din't give this 5 stars.  <br /> <br />Bottom Line:  A great book that is a safe bet in the \\"ever dangerous\\" gift category.  A must have for most home libraries.
0060920084|5.0|I'll start by saying I'm a Bill Bryson fan, having started by reading his book \\"A Walk in the Woods\\". He got me reading books again after a very long pause.  As a 50-something babyboomer having grown up in Kansas before moving cross-country to Southern California 30 years ago, I found this book to offer a deeply introspective, yet hilarious, look at my childhood travels with the family.  Also, as a devoted road-tripper, I felt as if I was travelling right along with Bill in an adventure that many of us would love to take given the time and appropriate situation in our lives.  Bill's writing in this book, as well as his other books I've read, comes from a somewhat sarcastic style.  I think this is his best, at least the equal to his \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" bestseller.  The guy's got a knack for telling a story in a way that makes you feel instantly comfortable, want to travel with him - and see the humor,delight and yet experience insight into life's travels.  If you are the kind of person who longs for the open road and appreciates a very genuine and intellectually humorous point of view, you will love this book.
0060537639|4.0|It seems that many of the readers of this book are of a similar position in that the author presents little hard evidence for \\"his\\" theory. That said, there is a lot in the book that is factual and for that the book is a good read. If you're into this sort of reading, then certainly do not stop with this book. It is not the last word on the subject. I strongly suggest reading Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings. Almost every book of this sort refer to it. And often they misrepresent it. Aside from the usual \\"there's no evidence\\" argument, my biggest problem with the book is that there is a wealth of ancient artifacts found in mesoamerica that indicate contact with Europeans, Arabs and Africans long before the dates that are ascribed to the Chinese here, yet ALL that evidence is carefully side stepped and only what refers to Chinese contact is brought into play. Although Gavin has experience in the Navy, I don't feel that that knowledge brought very much new to the table, aside from the endless references to following the current. The other big problem I have with his theory is that the Chinese supposedly mapped the entire New World and brought various advanced sciences to South Americans in only 3 years. In fact, it's stated that it took the Chinese 2.5 years to reach South America, leaving and 6 months to do everything and return home! I applaud Gavin for his effort to further our understanding and I hope that some of his theories will be researched by others more scientifically. For a much more scholarly book on the subject, I recommend Before Columbus by Cyrus H. Gordon.
B000AWYOGE|4.0|I'm glad I got to experience this movie in the theater. Sitting there in an almost empty Thursday movie viewing with a friend, I felt what the movie wanted to portray. <br /> <br />I loved the emphasis on the wet, dark, cold, goose bump chilling visuals. <br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) was a wonderfully convincing, loving and beautiful to look on film mother to her little daughter. <br /> <br />She moved to Roosevelt Island, because it's what she can afford and takes up an apartment in a cold, unsavory and plain gloomy building. From the beginning every scene in the building had this knot in your throat feeling that something is not right, you almost feel an approaching colossos of doom spreading it's dark wings over their entire life. <br /> <br />The water theme is constantly running through the movie, from dripping coming from her bedroom ceiling, to the mystery of the apartment upstairs, to the weird super who might be hiding something, to her ex husband who is giving her a hard time and back to her daughter who takes up talking to an imaginary Friend. <br /> <br />This was a long, but visually rich movie. Every time I drive on the bridge ( i live in NYC) and see Roosevelt Island, I always remember this movie, and I get goosebumps. <br />This is a great movie to put on a cold, rain night, with a cup of hot cocoa, a blanket and someone to hold your hand while you watch. <br /> <br />I love the ending; how everything unraveled and then came together, altho I think I let a tear fall down my cheek, hey I'm sensitive, I can cry easily. So go see it before you judge it, its great.
B000002LHX|3.0|Batman was Prince biggest commercial succes since his 1984 hit album Purple Rain. Album sales had flagged down eversince, despite (or perhaps on account of) his everchanging styles. Batman is an album which is greatly in service of the motion picture. Less orchestrated and with sparser instrumentation, the album sounds dark and stripped down. The rich diversity of predecessing album is gone. It is elaborate to please the casual listener and in support of the film. Despite that Prince makes room for his known themes of love, sex, religion and the struggle between good and evil. Perhaps this is why the Batman protject was so well suited for him. Batdance is a wellcrafted popsong with a rich and inteligent use of samples from the movie. Partyman is a plain fun funk song that works on any party. The Future depicts the atmosphere of the film beatifully. The pumping beats make it a great funkrock tune that works great when played loud on the speakers. Trust and Electric Chair are easy accessible popsongs that work just great. Scandalous is one of these ballads you simply love or hate. But it is way better than \\"Arms Of Orion\\" which is too pleasing and sweet for my taste. The whole album is consistent and has no fillers. Every song is wellcrafted and most rise above the average popsong. But if you measure it up against all other albums Prince made in the 80ties, you have too conclude that there is nothing \\"new\\" on this album. Prince made the perfect album for the film, sometimes pure fun, sometimes dark and dramatic sounding. But still it restrained his creativity to a point, that the album can't level up to most of his catalogue from that decade.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|-Spoiler Alert-  The premise of the movie is that Eaon is a secret 'terrorist'/freedom fighter/assasin, out to eliminate Trevor Goodchild, the corrupt leader of a future Utopia/Dystopia in a post-apocalypse world 400 years into the future. But of course there's more to the story.  She discovers a hidden truth:     The plague that destroyed most of humanity way back in 2011 had left the survivors sterile, and what people had thought were newborn babies were in fact implanted clone embryos.      Society had become a sterile museum piece, with no fertile offspring, no new ideas or growth was possible and the world had become a meaningless, perfect but unchanging island of technology.      On the other hand, death has been banished - as clones take the place of children, individuals had for centuries been succeeded by their carbon copies.  So while individuals had aged and passed, their DNA blueprints had endured.    And so the question:  Is life so precious that it should be preserved if technology makes it possible is invented?  The answer: No.     That position - that Cloning is Good - is taken by the villains. The moral: Death is necessary..  As carbon copies we lose our individuality and our sacred concept of pure free will is degraded as our abilities and attributes become tracable and assigned to our DNA instead of our personal decisions.    And thus humanity in the current definition ends, and we become simple cogs in a soul-less machine/society. Eaon sees this, as she describes the citizenry as 'walking ghosts'.     Like Venice, embalmed in the 1850's into a museum-area for tourists, so too would the Eaon Flux Future be a bleak and meaningless existence. Inflexible, narrow, devoid of uncertainty and the pleasure or pain of a dynamic possibilities.    So .. Eaon figures out who the good guys are.  She Arranges through a long and overly complex plot to kill the bad guys, thereby freeing the future from it's well-intentioned but wrong-headed techno-overlords, andlives happily ever after in a fertile world - until her certain death in the distant future, which is exactly as it should be.    In the end the city wall is broken and a reborn humanity is again free to flood outward into a rejuvinated natural world, a new Garden of Eden with a limitless future.    Hooray!..    Charlize Theron looks like a stunningly perfect ballerina sculpture from every angle, absolutely hypnotizing, like a poised Leni-Reifenstahl Uber-Athlete made of porcelain. At 29, I'm glad she made this movie. The world wants to see her beauty, and as gravity catches up with her it's likely she'll never look this good again.    But sadly..there wasn't enough personality in this film - the sterility was deeper than the surface.  Every single sentence felt like a movement of a chess piece on an inorganic 3D backboard which really needed more verve and charm. The total abstraction of 'society', while necessary to the story, felt shallow.     If we're meant to root for humanity - we needed to see it.  I didn't see anything on the screen worth saving - instead we were supposed to be rooting for a deeper, more complex humanity which the filmakers didn't decide to show us, probably due to time-constraints and lack of imagination.  They've built themselves a magnificent edifice, but there wasn't any jelly in this donut.  Just cement sculpture and beautiful acrobatics.    Good movies that make somewhat similar points about our DNA-enhanced/cloned dystopic future, but with different styles and emphasises.. are George Lucas's THX-1138 (1970), Gattaca(1997), Equilibrium(2000), Code 46(2003) and The Island (2005).     The other direction for modern Sci-Fi is Man-vs-Robot, or computer intelligence. Some movies in that genre are I-Robot (2004), A.I. Artificial Intelligience (1999), the Matrix movies, and the sublime Bladerunner(1982).     And then there's man vs. Alien, but that's a whole other story, And from there there's Man vs. the One Ring & the Orc Army, or Potter vs. Golden Snitch.  Fantasy has a place.    Sci-Fi represents a deep vein of Metaphysical BS which Hollywood should continue to mine - I wait with baited breath.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I was very happy with this movie. I think Christian Bale did an outstanding job. I really liked the way they covered the \\"origin\\" of Batman. <br />And, of course, Morgan Freeman is great, and the batmobile is awesome! I think the story line flows perfectly. Overall, this is an A+ movie. I have seen it several times, and I always enjoy it!
B000056N8X|3.0|Unlike some the other Highlander movies this has some great emotional punch to it due to the death of Connor Macleod and the relationship between his and Duncan Macleod's friendship, same clan different vintage. This movie has so many horrible afflictions that the great emotional punch and sword play is completely ruined by total disregard for the fans. Let's face it the editing was atrocious. If you saw the nice extras on the dvd you'd realize that they didn't have as bad a script as the final outcome would lead you to believe. They actually mixed up the chronology of the scenes making it non-sensical and other fatal flaws as well. The scenery is fantastic-this is no joke. Great job on that. Adrian Paul unlike much of the sixth season of Highlander really seems to be feeling his character again and putting in a quality performance. Lambert plays his character evasively which serves the character very well. They do not do a good job of making him look appropriately aged which yanks you out of the setting of the story. The woman who played Kate in the lead is well-nothing to note. No charisma. The sex scene put into this movie with her and Adrian Paul is so lacking in any chemistry or true purpose that I feel it was just thrown in there to show Paul's rear and this girls bare chest. Nudity is not offensive to me but when you throw it in there like this and the actors have no chemistry-it just puts me off. The plot line is contradicting to story lines in the series, and obviously to the movie, but this is the history of Highlander. It is riddled with contradictions so that fans who have an attention to detail are usally frustrated over and over. To be honest you don't have to have much attention to detail at all to find these contradictions in plot which is one of the biggest problems of the franchise! Furthermore if you thought The Kurgan from the first movie was menacing, you might wonder what in the world makes Jacob Kell from this one a threat in the slightest. With better casting and a more refined script, you could have made that work well enough due to the mental and emotional aspect, however this guy is comical. Some great potential is in this movie, but it was never met. They had a little voice over thing with the man who produced or directed and the ''consultants'' who worked on the series too. This guy had to ask while watching the film, who Methos was. So this should give you an idea of how well fans of Peter Wingfield's character were treated. He's very good in the movie though for the few moments he's there he gets little opportunity to shine as possibly the most gifted actor in the film-he's better than Paul much of the time in the series so that is no surprise. If you were a fan of the series I can't tell you not to watch the movie-but I can tell you not to buy it and then watch it for the first time. If you only watched the movies-no point in watching Lambert getting killed off for a reason that they really can't back up with this kind of illusive plot mumbo jumbo. I like many highlander fans watched first, filled in the reasoning in my own head and disregarded the crap that never belonged there in the first place later. Most of us are just used to making a cohesive coherent chronology of this epic fantasy in our minds and letting the waste matter be filtered out. You've got to do alot of that in this movie. There is actually a quickening sequence from a nobody character in here which is on par with Connor's quickening. Connor's quickening was smaller than The Kurgans or the guy from the third movies. Shameful. The final quickening is actually very pleasing to the eye. Great work of art these things are normally even on the lesser budget of the series. However the first quickening of the movie-mentioned already- totally lost the idea of the quickening. None of the ''lightning'' as you might call it, even went into the man who killed the immortal. It made no sense. Other huge plot holes exist and are so big thatthey do ruin the beautiful emotional dramas that were struggling to play themselves out. You'll probably be asking yourself ''what?'' numerous times if you are a fan of the series by the way. Amanda's not in it and Methos is treated poorly as well as Joe. No other character's from the series are in it actually. It's just a mess. I agree with another reviewer that suggests that moving the worlds of the series and the movies together only satisfies fans of just one a little bit. I liked both the first movie and the series alot but this movie really exemplifies the biggest problem of the highlander universe- tons of potential almost never coming close to half fruition. This is just such a frustrating thing. The garbage lines coming out of Kell's mouth being read by an actor who treats it like a cartoon villain are so bad it makes me tear up. The ridiculous scene [great choreography though] where Adrian is attacked by numerous immortals is so unrealistic in the highlander fantasy it just adds to the plot holes and horrible ideas that would never have made it onto the series no matter how big there budget was. Rent before buying, please take my advice. I just want to go on forever about the bad and try to exaggerate the little good here but it's not worth it.
0553381687|5.0|I have not read the sequels to this book, but I can say that this book is easily the most enjoyable book I have ever read (including Tolkien). At first I thought I would never be able to remember all the characters that Martin keeps introducing but he gives them all enough attention relative to their importance that the narrative of countless linked subplots flows seamlessly. His characterisation is brilliant, especially for female characters. This is the first book that I have read that didn't seem to waste space. Every chapter is nice and short and delivers plenty of plot development. Almost every chapter seemed to contain a story twist, varying from small and delightful to shocking. After reading this book, it feels as if the bar for fantasy writing (although fantasy elements are only subtle in this book) has been raised much higher. Compared to some other things I've seen rated 5 stars, this easily deserves 6.
B000002J2D|5.0|25 years and it still stands the test of time. I remember like yesterday seeing them perform it live in Milwaukee with local acquaintance Daryl Stuermer holding up the bass end of things. Fantastic show and a fantastic album. No one in their right mind can find fault with the well crafted, seamless precision and flowing, haunting melodic sounds that usher forth from this album. As interesting as their former prog material was this is THE pinnacle of musical success for Genesis. The fact that it was a huge commercial success bears little relevance to the musical importance of the album as the motherlode (excuse the inside pun) is not the hit Follow You, Follow Me, but rather the album taken as a whole, finely crafted masterpiece. The songs flow together in a rich tapestry with well written, thought provoking lyrics few others can or have matched. <br /> <br />I strongly suggest an uninterrupted listening session, let the disc spin, mellow out, absorb what it has to offer and be rewarded with being enriched for the experience. Rarely will you find such a gushing review from me like this, but as time goes on I realize there are few true gems from this era, let alone any era that have the total overall enduring qualities such as this album has. <br />
0446677450|5.0|Considering the times that we are going through, I cannot recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad enough. And great to see that Rich Dad Poor Dad is still in the top 30 books at respectable book stores! <br /> <br />Great book. Must reading.
B000BCE918|5.0|We liked all three of the movies although the second one wasn't as interesting once the t-rex was brought to the U.S. It seems to be more edge-of-your-seat when the heroes are stranded on the dinosaur's home turf and at a disadvantage. I would rate the first movie as the best, with the third being next best and The Lost World coming in third. We already have all three on dvd but I liked the packaging on this release as it takes up less shelf space and keeps all three movies together, making them easier to locate. With three kids running loose that's a big plus! Unlike some multi-disk packages the container on this one is sturdy and protects the movies, and looks pretty cool, too. The disks themselves look great with dinosaur scenes in color on each, unlike the older red, black, and white versions. Also, I discovered that the third movie can be heard in DTS 5.1 as well as Dolby 5.1 just like the first dvd release for those of you with a DTS decoder. So, to sum it all up, I agree with the first reviewer of this Adventure Pack: You can't beat it for the price!
B000B8QEYC|1.0|I love Enya with all my heart and was anxiously anticipating this new album. I love how her music is so moving and mood altering. <br />However, this album absolutely stunned me. It does not possess the mood of the other albums, has nothing consequential to say, and sounds more like an album of children's songs with the simple melodies and highly predictable lyrics.  <br />There are 2 songs on this entire album that I \\"like\\" but none i love. <br />I hope future endeavors do not duplicate this horrific collection. <br />I guess I will have to wait another 5 years. <br />
B000BOH8XW|4.0|When I got Fijacin Oral Volumen I, I wasn't disappointed necessarily...I kind of expected that it wouldn't measure up to her past ones (DELL and PD). Although it was a little too synthesized for my tastes, I did enjoy it, and continue to do so. <br /> <br />With Oral Fixation Volume II, I was surprised by a couple songs. I expected that this CD, too, would be a little more pop or polished than I wanted, but having that in mind I think I came out satisfied. <br /> <br />I absolutely love the first song, \\"How Do You Do.\\" Personally, I've grown up in a very conservative religious family and it's been hard for me because I'm not that way by nature, and so the friction that is there has caused some problems in my life and I'm trying to breakaway from it a bit. This song is WONDERFUL in regards to that because it deals with religion, more specifically the idea of God. Often it seems to many that God is just this mysterious figure that's in control of everything and doesn't really care...this song is written from a questioning point of view, almost as a challenge of sorts. It deals with questions like \\"If God is so good, why is there pain and suffering,\\" etc. It makes you think and also services to maybe burn some of the frustrated energy off you have concerning the topic of religion and God. <br /> <br />I really enjoy \\"Animal City\\" because it's got a very exotic feel to it mixed with some great lyrics to back it up. I think in this song Shakira is kind of trying to dispense some type of nostalgic wisdom thru a bit of playful cynicism. I love the line \\"'Cause it's an animal city, it's a cannibal world, so be obedient, don't argue\\" She's extending a warning in order to spare someone some pain while at the same time being a little bit sarcastic and dark. <br /> <br />\\"Dreams For Plans,\\" simply put, is a song about real love. Not just skipping thru a flowery field love or GOD this world sucks love, just real. Seeing that things change over the months and years and you can either abandon it or work on it and upkeep it. <br /> <br />\\"Timor\\" is a wonderful song lyrically! I love how she's pointing a light on American democracy and what a joke it is in some ways. This song is very political and very idealistic, which is what I LOVE about Shakira, it harkens back to her old says on Pies Descalzos and Donde Estan Los Ladrones. <br /> <br />Overall I'd say that the reason I'm most impressed by this album is the lyrics rather than the sound. There are the token cliche songs and the remakes of songs from Fijacin Oral Volumen I that I don't really like (except \\"Something\\" is ok). So I'd say go for it, don't set your hopes too high, but don't write it off as (complete) crap either!
B000063WDH|5.0|The Black Keys are one of the best bands around today.  This album is great from start to finish.  You will not be disappointed.  I saw them in concert and they are just as great live as they are on CD.  If you are interested in good old bluesy rock then this band is for you.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Well, I didnt like this album when I first heard it, then I saw the video for Knives Out, and I kinda liked the song, so I thought I'd give this album a fair chance, and now I am listening to this damn album like an addict. I just cannot stop feeling sad and thinking about You and Whose Army, which is probably one of the best songs ever. Not as consistent as Kid A. But totally different from OK computer and Bends which seem more commercial.
B000002WNP|5.0|I'm a relatively new Elvis fan and I didn't know where to begin because there are so many albums and hit collections... I decided on starting with this box set because it spanned so much of his career and because it included an alternate version of my favorite song of his - Suspicious Minds. <br /> <br />The sound remastering is excellent and the packaging is great. Well worth the $$. <br /> <br />This is a must have for the long-time Elvis fan or the new fan like me!  I'm definitely hooked on Elvis now and I plan to follow up this purchase with his 50s and 70s box set.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's not possible for these people to create a bad album. There are normal musicians, and then there is Radiohead, sheer genius. Anything Thom Yorke touches turns to gold. Music has never had this kind of depth, although I feel this is the more commercial of all Radiohead albums, its still one of the best. I think one or two songs are weak in comparison, but only when compared to the other songs on the album. If your don't have it already, first buy it. Yes Radiohead is \\"back to save the universe\\", the universe of music.
0895260131|4.0|Before I saw this book title (I can't remember where I first ran across it), if asked, I would have said that Islam was a peaceful religion, that, like many other religions in history, has been hijacked by evil-doers.  But when I saw this book, I wondered.  Could he be right?  I decided to read it, and give the author a chance to make his point.<br /><br />I am acquainted with some American Muslims who would argue against this, but I wonder if they aren't plagued by their own bias.  After all, who wants to think badly of their own religion and/or ethnic ancestors?  I was shocked to learn that many non-Arab Muslims have not actually read (don't understand) their own holy book, that they merely recite passages from it in the original Arabic.<br /><br />This book seems very well researched. The author appears to be conscious of the likelihood of an anti-Muslim bias, and I believe it inspired him to study his subject harder.  He gives many suggestions for further reading.  He explores the current media line on Islam, the history of Islamic/Judeo-Chrisian relations, makes conclusions, and provides his evidence at every step.  And in a feature I loved, he presents ideas for defeating the enemy.<br /><br />Another person that picked up my copy commented that it was very repetitive - the author says some of the same things over and over.  I agree this is true, however he has a purpose.  In his discussion of an individual point he presents the evidence that backs it up.  Some evidence applies to multiple points.  I did not find any repitition to pointless, only mildly tedious on occasion.  Additionally, the prose is highly readable.<br /><br />One thing I found somewhat annoying in this book is that the author uses a comparison of Islam and Christianity as part of his framework.  I myself am of Christian ancestry, but was not raised in any particular faith.  I have spiritual beliefs, but they do not match closely enough with any specific religion for me to join one.  My annoyance was b/c I felt he was assuming his readership to be Christian.  However, if his intended audience is the American public, that is not statistically unreasonable.<br /><br />Although I would rather that the author's hypothesis were not true, at this time, I believe the author has made his point.

B00004XONN|5.0|Yes, you will go \\"What the ****?\\" the first time you hear this album. Give it time, and then without realising, u will be haunted by the tunes. They are so haunting and melancholic, you cannot stop thinking about the songs. Genius is the only word which can describe this album.
B0006213H6|5.0|When upon listening to this album, I releazied that it is the opposite demeanor of the other albums Sigur Ros have made. There is ambient soundscapes of the otherworldly, to bright and heavenly, peaceful and powerfull music. <br />If you became a fan of Sigur Ros from the other albums ( \\"()\\", \\"Tak..\\", \\"Agaetis byrjun\\" ) You will probably dislike this. But don't let the first song disrupt your ideas about the artists.  <br />Despite how different it all sounded compared to the other albums, I still greatly charish this one. So if your a fan of ambience and Sigur Ros, this is a must buy. If you're not, however, you might want to try Agaetis byrjun or Takk first.

We pre ordered, it came and...Talk about non-triditional...It's boring...for lack of a better word. With the talent she has, what a terrible waste. Maybe I'm too old fashion, but making up a language along the way just to get the sounds..... In one cut the same sounds, (as they are not words) are repeated so many times I thought the CD player was stuck. I got up and gave it a wack. Well thanks for \\"Paint the Sky\\", \\"The Celts\\", \\"Trees\\", and the others. This one is disappointing, wish I had kept the money.  Hugh and Dee
B00003CXCW|5.0|Nominated for eleven Oscars, this movie is about a fictional silent film star Norma Desmond played by Gloria Swanson whose fictional character has not worked for decades. The retired star lives in a large mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills with her young \\"house guest\\" i.e.: Holden's character. He is a thirty year old screen writer, about twenty years her junior. The idea here is that she has been rejected by Hollywood as being too old to work. Discarded by the industry, she lives in a fantasy world of isolation in a decaying mansion waiting for her next big picture. She has latched onto the Holden character as a companion.<br /><br />In the end it won just 3 Oscars in 1951 for art, writing, and music. Billy Wilder won a writing Oscar after six prior nominations and one prior Oscar. Overall, it was beaten by the 5 Oscar winning Bette Davis movie All About Eve.<br /><br />This defeat at the Oscars in itself has much irony. The triumph of the Davis movie at the Oscars kills the theory that older actresses cannot work in Hollywood. The Bette Davis movie beat out Sunset Boulevard and the fictional Norma Desmond, the latter a movie that implies that older female actresses are not wanted in Hollywood. But the winner Davis was nominated for 11 Oscars, won two, and she made 103 movies working until she was 81. So to me that creates some doubt about the idea that this film makes a real statement about old actresses in Holywood. Gloria Swanson had only made one movie since 1934, similar to the Norma character, but her career did make a modest comeback in later years and she was in 5 more movies after the present success.<br /><br />The Academy members thought that this movie had some merit for innovation, art, etc. Perhaps at the time it was not the the best in its day, and it was certainly an uphill battle against a good Bette Davis movie in the 1940s. But over time it has survived as well if not better than the Bette Davis movie, and emerged as a film noir classic.<br /><br />There are a number of good performances and nice touches in the movie including a 5 minute appearance by Cecil B. DeMille playing himself, a Young Jack Web as Artie Green - a friend of Holden's character, and Nancy Olson playing Betty Schaefer who is a screen writer working with the Holden character. Also, Erich von Stroheim playing Max von Mayerling, the butler, is solid.<br /><br />Bottom line: A film noir classic set in a decaying mansion inhabited by an aging silent film star who has lost her mind. You will either love this movie or hate it. I prefer something more upbeat but thought that it was entertaining, less excitement than Double Indeminity and overall not as attractive as Casablanca.<br /><br />The movie is a survivor and now a classic from the film noir period. It is among the best of the period with Casablanca, Double Indeminity and the Bogart-Bacall's and Edward G. Robinson's Key Largo.f good performances and nice touches in the movie including a 5 minute appearance by Cecil B.

B000002UAO|5.0|Today is December 3, 2005. Forty years ago Rubber Soul saw the light. Forty years... the same time that Moses and his people were in the desert... Will Rubber Soul finally get into the promise land reserved for the greatest albums of all time? Surely many people, like I do, already put it there, but truth is that common opinion overlooks this album, paying much more attention to other Beatles masterpieces like Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, the White Album or Abbey Road. Because the Beatles alone are a whole world, and in the Beatles world Rubber Soul is like Odessey And Oracle (the Zombies) or Forever Changes (Love) in the music world: overlooked. I know that many Beatles fans consider Rubber Soul to be a masterpiece as well (some of them say that \\"every Beatles album is a masterpiece\\"), and some serious fans usually say things like \\"Rubber Soul is the beginning of the greatness of the Beatles\\" or \\"Rubber Soul is a period of transition\\". I agree that Rubber Soul started something, but my view is that Rubber Soul is not just a \\"first step\\" but it is a peak in the Beatles career; and the true transitional album was Help!, not Rubber Soul. <br /> <br />Rubber Soul is my favourite Beatles album, and I have some (always subjective) reasons to love this album more than others. 1) The songwriting: John, my favourite Beatle, here is at his best, lyrically and melodically; Paul will get better in Revolver, but here he also wrote a couple of his eternal classics; and both of George songs are outstanding among the whole George's career. 2) The instrumentation: some successful experiments like the sitar (\\"Norwegian Wood\\"), the fuzz bass (\\"Think For Yourself\\") and a speed-up piano (\\"In My Life\\"); new sounds in the guitars, more melodic bass and arguably the very best Ringo's drumming with the Beatles. 3) The production: it is true that this album is more carefully produced than previous Beatles albums, but it's not overproduced like the next albums (especially Sgt. Pepper's); I findthe production of Rubber Soul to be in its right place, without all that lovely but sometimes excessive orchestration, a true rock (or folk rock) record. These are just a few points about why I prefer Rubber Soul over other famous Beatles albums; still Revolver is among my very favourite albums of all time and probably the most important step in rock music, Sgt. Pepper's is always a magic journey, the White Album rocks my day beyond its mess, and Abbey Road is the previous step to Heaven. <br /> <br />John wrote three masterpieces from Rubber Soul that always are included in my personal \\"Top 10 best Beatles songs ever\\" list. \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\", beyond the famous Indian sitar and the wood from Norway, has a mystery peaceful spirit from nowhere; the lyrics are so good that they were included in a classic English poetry anthology. Also from nowhere land is \\"Nowhere Man\\" with its beautiful and fresh harmonies; although this track is known as the first Beatles song that doesn't talk about romantic love, the song is showing us a lonely man who love is all he needs and is waiting for it. And \\"In My Life\\" is a favourite of everyone, with its nostalgic words which talk about the past but seem to talk about the future too; the baroque piano solo is delicious. <br /> <br />The album has two classic ballads that became very covered just a few days after the album was released. \\"Michelle\\" is from Paul's garden: delicate acoustic guitars, sweet bass, a guitar solo that seems to play a different melody and some French lyrics make this a timeless classic. The even more acoustic \\"Girl\\" is another proof of why John was at the peak of his songwriting during those last months of 1965, singing about this dreamed girl loved despite her behaviour; a little gem for Rubber Soul. <br /> <br />\\"Drive My Car\\" is an amazing opener and maybe the only pure rocker of the album; the guitar-bass combination in this song is just perfect, and the story is very funny. Some people say that this track has nothing to do with the folk spirit of Rubber Soul and shouldn't be there (they usually prefer the mutilated American version of the album, which starts with \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\"), but I don't agree at all with them, because beyond the fact that Rubber Soul could fairly be called a folk rock record, the true magic of this album resides in its diversity of sounds. <br /> <br />It seems that those were not happy days in Paul's romantic life, since he wrote two almost anti-love songs which seem to have been dedicated to his girlfriend Jane Asher: \\"You Won't See Me\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You\\". The former has a Help!-sound, with almost no guitars and based on some interesting bass lines, piano and impressive drumming, plus joyful backing vocals. The other one is an enjoyable track as well, driven by acoustic guitars until those exciting electric guitar lines appear. <br /> <br />Now it's time for the George's paragraph. George has two songs here, and they are indeed very good. Just for the fuzz bass, \\"Think For Yourself\\" is a song that deserves attention, but it also says some interesting things to think about (for ourselves). And \\"If I Needing Someone\\" is George at his best Jim/Roger McGuinn version, with that Byrdish guitar and those Byrdish harmonies. <br /> <br />\\"The Word\\" deserves another paragraph. A prophetic song about (or perhaps part of the reason of) the feeling of Universal Love of the second part of the 1960's years. Don't miss the message of this fantastic pseudo-psychedelic song. <br /> <br />Three more tracks that could be called as \\"fillers\\" (in comparison to the best songs) complete this album; however, each of them have something good to say. \\"What Goes On\\" is a country rocker which seems to be no more than an excuse for Ringo to sing a track, but it has a good rhythm and includes (for those days) a quite long guitar solo. \\"Wait\\" is filled with a very interesting tone pedal guitar. \\"Run For Your Life\\" is not genius songwriting, but John's vocals are really great there; the line \\"that's the end, little girl\\" makes the song be an adequate closer. <br /> <br />What more can I say? Every time I listen to this album is a special time, so I try not to listen to it too often to keep it special. But today is its birthday, so today will be another special day. <br /> <br />If I didn't bore you, I invite you to visit my website dedicated to this album: <br /> <br />[...] <br />
B0002CHIJW|1.0|I had been wanting to see this \\"notorious\\" movie for a long time.   Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say \\"What's The Big Deal?\\".   Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie.   The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound.   Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track.   I listened to the latter.   It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her.

B0006419J6|1.0|Hey, Will Smith, what the hell did Asimov ever do to you? This movie takes a science fiction classic and rapes it with bad acting and horrid dialog. I honestly don't understand why they bothered to call this \\"I, Robot\\" - it has NOTHING in common with the book except a couple of character names. This is a bad action movie and a slap in the face to Asimov's ground breaking work. I have no problem with crappy movies aimed at teenagers and other people who need lots of flashing lights and explosions to hold there attention but this movie is bad enough to turn people away from the book (read the book - seeing the movie won't even spoil the ending for you i promise).
0765348780|2.0|A close cousin, as many have pointed out, is Glen Cook's Black Company series. However, they are also very different and not in a way that flatters Erikson. Cook's protagonists are gritty, vulnerable, often outgunned and seem to portray soldiers quite well. The plots are usually tight, simple and logical.<br /><br />The Mazalan books, in constrast, are huge and full of superpowered characters and magic. In many ways, they read almost as comic books. Which is fun, for a while, then it wears off. The fact that almost every member of the 8th Sapper Squad (or whatever Whiskey Jack's unit is called) turns out to be so powerful is odd for a seemingly minor unit which isn't quite depicted as being the Rangers or SAS of the Malazan Army.<br /><br />The plots are complex, but did not really engage me and they don't seem to lead anywhere. In fact, what ended the series for me was a passage, in book 4 (House of Chains) where one character just _lectures_ another about the cleverness of the Empress's latest ploy. To me, it seemed contrived, rather than brilliant or significant. I felt that I was being lectured about how brilliant Erikson's plot twists are. I stopped and could never quite pick it up again.<br /><br />Why did I stick with it for so long? There are lots of inventive ideas and the world's background can be first rate, at times.<br /><br />On a side note, I found Erikson's approach to women characters, in a very, very violent world, interesting. Basically, his world seems to postulate physical/muscular equality, though he never mentions it. As a result, many of the women are just as liable to be soldiers as the men and there is no hint of a \\"weaker sex\\". Kind of an artifact, but it works.<br /><br />I think Erikson should finish up the series as planned, take a break and then write something else. In doing so, he should tighten his plots, throw out his 15th level characters (sorry, bit of D&D jargon slipping out...) and trim his books considerably. In other words, his editor should own him, big time. But he should keep the intricate worldbuilding that has made the Malazan series so enjoyable. If so, we would be getting a pretty impressive new voice in the Fantasy landscape.r words, his editor should own him, big time.

B00005JOHI|4.0|If you've never seen or read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, this latest Pride and Prejudice re-make starring Keira Knightley  is an okay introduction.  <br /> <br />If you're a huge Jane Austen fan, then this movie is still okay for you. It's not nearly as disappointing as might have feared. <br />  <br />I had concerns going into this movie, but none of them were borne out. The pace was rushed, but not too rushed; it jam-pack the story into 2 short hours, and unfortunately, certain storylines & characters were condensed to make them fit (Wickham-gasp!-was but a sidenote! ). Keira knightly brilliantly played Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennett. The plot and spirit stayed more-or less true to the book. I guess cliff notes are sufficient sometimes. <br /> <br />Also, this remake adds something new to the Jane Austen cannon: verisimilitude to true 1700'ss life. Unlike other period remakes, which always show immaculate parlors, tidy living, and impeccably coiffed Young Ladies, this world was dirty and messy. Dogs roamed free through the Bennett home, food was grabbed and gobbled at the table, gentlemen weren't clean-shaven, and ladies obviously did not have the advantage of shampoo, hairspray, or styling products. The set felt more like noisy, dirty Colonial Williamsburg come to life, and not the hushed, immaculate parlors of BBC fantasy. <br /> <br />But the best thing about this remake was the dance scenes. \\"I do lore a ball\\" is something Austen characters are wont to matter, and that passion comes off well on-screen here. Steady-cam images put you in the action, and the constant movement makes it fun to follow the intrigue. There is, however, too much of a good thing, and by the end of the second ball scene, I really wanted the cinematographer to go find a tripod! <br /> <br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie. While it's not the triumph of the BBC remake, it's also not the disaster I feared it would be. The sweetness that appealed to me when I first read it, of characters who long for love but don't hook up til they get married, as well as the sarcasm & humor that only struck me later, all comes across on this movie screen. And probably will on DVD, too (no rush to the theater for this one).  <br /> <br />  <br />
B000BGR0OM|5.0|The greatest hits set, \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" offers ample evidence of this band's ability to create great songs. They were quite a formidable singles machine. <br />The first dozen or so cuts remind you how they were all over the radio/MTV for a few years, and you'll find you know these songs by heart. <br />After opening with a new cut, and the thin \\"Love is a Stranger\\", you get one classic after another.  <br />\\"Sweet Dreams\\", with that fat synth and those soulful, evocative yet still icy-cool vocals of Annie Lennox, became their introduction to the pop world. They had a signature sound, and then spent the next two albums refining and expanding it. <br />\\"Who's That Girl\\" and \\"Here Comes The Rain Again\\" are two exquisite singles that follow in \\"Dreams\\" vein, but I'm delighted to see (and hear) the joyous \\"Right By Your Side\\" making the list here.  <br />The next three powerhouse tunes come off their \\"third\\" album, with \\"Would I Lie To You\\" showing off Dave Stewart's exuberant, chord-spewing guitar work.  \\"Angel\\" is a soft, haunting, sweet pop-soul confection, and \\"Sisters\\" is an anthemic, R&B stomp with twitchy guitars from Mr. Stewart and towering vocals from none other than Miss Aretha Franklin. <br />After than opening salvo, the quality declines...but not by much (except that \\"I Need A Man\\" fiasco...)...I thought \\"17 Again\\" was particularly affecting (as opposed to 'affected'...see above)... <br /> <br />Overall, with nice remastering and 19 songs, this is an easy five-star package. You couldn't have asked for more in a single-disc summation of this killer band's catalogue.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I gotta hand it to Madonna. Just when I thought American Life was going to be the ruination of her career, she went back to the basics and came out with an album based entirely, and I mean ENTIRELY, on what shot her to stardom in the first place: dance music. In terms of innovation, this is not Madonna's finest hour. As good as it is, nothing can top Ray of Light. Overall, this is a very decent collection of dance songs. Let's take a look at it track-by-track: <br /> <br />1) HUNG UP: Everyone knows this song. This is a very catchy nu disco-house track, suited perfectly for clubs and dancefloors. But it's not perfect. It's downfall? The lyrics are a bit underhand for an advanced artist like Madonna. Unfortunately, this lyrical disadvantage seems to plague a few more tracks on the album. <br /> <br />2) GET TOGETHER: My favorite track. This one fronts a perfect breakbeat, backed by an awesome, dreamy tranceline. The production, though top-notch like the rest of the tracks here, really takes the cake. It has a DJ Tiesto-like quality, mind you, I'm comparing this production to that of the #1 DJ in the world. But once again, the lyrics, especially in the chorus fall short of Madonna's introspective, creative ability. All the same, this small faux pas is completely overshadowed by the brilliance of the production. <br /> <br />3) SORRY: I have mixed feelings about this track. The lyrics are a little bit, but not totally, better than the first two tracks. Madonna saying \\"I'm sorry\\" in about six different languages at different points in the track adds some innovation but does not nearly compensate for the so-so dance beat and cliched \\"don't say you're sorry\\" theme of the song. <br /> <br />4) FUTURE LOVERS: This is a great track. The first minute and a half entails Madonna muttering introspective lines about love over an electro-ambient tone, then it breaks into a bass-booming display of absolutely brilliant production and lyrics. It's only one of two tracks here where Mirwais Ahmadzai collaborates on the production, which is unfortunate because he's brilliant and he proves it on this track as much as he did on the two previous Madonna albums. <br /> <br />5) I LOVE NEW YORK: Four words- what was she thinking? This has got to be the worst track on the album. The lyrics are absolutely horrendous and the beat is not even that great. Take these lyrics for example: \\"I don't like cities, but I love New York. Other places make me feel like a dork.\\" The chorus ain't much better either: \\"Other cities always make me mad. Other places always make me sad. No other city ever made me glad except New York. I love New York.\\" Can she not do any better than that? <br /> <br />6) LET IT WILL BE: Much more introspective track than the previous. The production entails Mirwais Ahmadzai once again (thank God). It sort of sounds like a throwback to Ray of Light, not that that's a bad thing, but I would hate to see her just flatline in that era. There's not much more I can say, but it's good. <br /> <br />7) FORBIDDEN LOVE: Probably the softest track on the album (not like that's saying much), it's more mid-tempo. The lyrics are great, the beat is house-ish, and the synths are awesome. The one thing it could have done without was the overused vocoder. Other than that, it's a very easy listen. <br /> <br />8) JUMP: I wasn't all too impressed with this one. The chorus is too predictable (\\"Are you ready to jump? Get ready to jump. Don't ever look back oh baby.\\") It sounds like something too similar to her Like a Prayer era. It fits in okay with the rest of the tracks here, but there are better ones. <br /> <br />9) HOW HIGH: This track suffers the same lyrical chorus problem as the one before it. The beat is decent, but the chorus is subpar. There's nothing very introspective here, the theme of this track is about fame and fortune, something very cliched with high-profile music stars. The best quality of this track is that it is catchy, but that's all I can give it. <br /> <br />10) ISAAC: My second favorite track on the album. I believe the man singing on here is singing a Hebrew prayer (probably an ode to Madonna's Kabballah fad). The violins, guitar and beat combine to form a very well produced track, though not as dancy as the others. The lyrics are probably the most innovative on the album. This track also has a bit of the Ray of Light throwback feel to it as well.  <br /> <br />11) PUSH: Very heavy basslines and a jungly, almost hip-hop-ish beat characterize this song, which is interesting because it steers away from the techno-base the album is built upon. This isn't so much a bad thing because it does offer diversity. The downfall here is that the lyrics are, once again, very crappy and sung way too fast outside of the chorus. It sounds a lot like when she tried to rap on American Life... And we all know how that went over, like a fart in church. <br /> <br />12) LIKE IT OR NOT: Decent closer to the album. The beat and synth has a very electro-feel to it, but it's the lyrics make it here. They're not all that innovative, but they are powerful, which is a good thing. The chorus is: \\"This is who I am. You can like it or not. You can love me or leave me, cause I'm never gonna stop.\\" These words reassure us that Madonna is here to stay and that's the theme of the song. <br /> <br />As you can see, the lyrics in a few of the songs could have used some work, but the top-notch production here makes this album regardless of if it's Madonna or anyone else. I would definitely recommend this album to any Madonna or electronic music fan.
B0000029DD|5.0|Why do the good die young? <br /> <br />Listen to Grace and try to fathom what Jeff Buckley would have become had he not died at 1997 at age 30. Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk and live albums like Mystery White Boy and Live at Sin-E only serve to further outline Buckley's blooming greatness. <br /> <br />But Grace...Grace. The album is a beautiful debut, filled with precise, poetic lyric imagery and Buckley's soaring, 3-and-a-half octaves voice. The cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Halleljuha\\" is possibly the best version of the song, serene and fragile; \\"Lover You Should've Come Over\\" is achingly intense. Buckley dips between grungey rock on \\"Eternal Life\\" and the art-tripfest of \\"Dream Brother\\"; \\"Last Goodbye\\" is a sweet love song and \\"Mojo Pin\\", the album's opener, is like Robert Plant as choirboy. <br /> <br />All things considered, if you've heretofore missed out on Jeff Buckley, this album is certainly your saving Grace.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|It's long time coming for this movie version.  I watched the stage musical when I was in my teens and then, there was this rumour that a movie was going to be made starring the originals, Sarah Brightman & Michael Crawford.  So, I waited and before I knew it, it's over a decade.  Anyhow, the wait is worthwhile.  Referring to Joel, the director, he made a right move in choosing young cast to the production.  He did it for both reasons, to broaden the target mix and also to make sense of Christine, of her trapped in a triangular relationship between Raoul and Phantom.  The movie paces along steadily and whilst it's not following frame by frame to the musical production, the adaptation is very faithful.  On top of that, it gives us glimpse of how the Phantom came about and how did he roam about in the Theatre.  It's a bit of \\"Batman Begins\\" strategy.  Whilst Gerald Butler's voice isn't as distinctive as Michael Crawford's, he compensates that by his dark screen presence.  Roaul's character is two-dimensional, valiant and swashbuckling.  I would have to say that to me, the outstanding performance would have to come from veteran, Miranda Richardson who's making effort to speak English with a tinge of French accent whilst others are carrying stiff upper lip English accent.  Minnie Driver is hillarious as the Prima Donna but somehow, she's no Italiano as she's depicting in this movie.  Whilst Emmy Rossum sings like an angel, her band of performance is once again restricted to being an innocent girl.  For the beautiful direction, (set) production, and may I say, soundtrack, this is definitely a DVD to keep to watch and watch again.  Such a quiet achiever.  Well-done

B000002B7O|5.0|* Osbourne album remix prompts class action:  <br /> <br />- After bassist Bob Daisley and drummer Lee Kerslake filed lawsuits demanding royalties over their performances in two Ozzy Osbourne albums, \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary of a Madman\\", recording executives remastered the albums to strip out their performances and replace them with performances by Robert Trujillo and Mike Bordin for the 2002 reissue. Now Illinois fan Anthony Wester has sued Sony Entertainment and Epic Records, saying he felt misled and cheated to learn of the substitution, and his lawyer wants class-action status for the suit. (Steve Patterson, \\"'Remastered' Osbourne albums a snow job, fan's suit charges\\", Chicago Sun-Times, Feb. 21; \\"Bassist, drummer cut from Ozzy album remixes, fan sues\\", AP/AZCentral.com, Feb. 23). - <br /> <br />This doesn't appear to be the 2002 remaster, but let it be known again that \\"business ethics\\" is a contradiction in terms.  Never underestimate the hidden powers that be. <br />
B000002KZ6|5.0|Just one more time I want to feel the way I felt the first time I listened to Talking Heads. I have been spending money on CD's for over twenty years looking for something that would turn my head inside out the way \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" did back in 1983.<br /><br />As the tracks of \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" passed through my head, I sensed the simultaneous disjointedness and unity of the music. It was as if each element of the music was a separate entity--independently broadcasting out across the universe. Somehow I had happened onto the blessed nexus of the universe where those independed pulses crossed in perfection, creating the delicious white suburban nerd funk of the \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" Talking Heads.<br /><br />It was a beautiful moment--one that turned my head inside out and overwhelmed my grip on the last vestiges of seventies art rock. It opened a new world to me. Now over twenty years later, I have dabbled in everything from jazz to opera to punk. Nothing has turned me around like my first listen to \\"Speaking in Tongues.\\"<br /><br />And over twenty years later, nothing quite compares. These days, I hear bits of Talking Heads in Clap Your Hands Say Yeah and Arcade Fire. Also, don't miss the complete cover of \\"Remain in Light\\" in Phish's \\"Livephish Volume 15 - 10.31.96, The Omni, Atlanta Georgia.<br /><br />The closest I have every come to another \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" moment? The night I listened to the Olivia Tremor Control's \\"Dusk at Cubist Castle.\\"
B000A6T262|5.0|I wasn't sure if this was ever really going to happen, and if it did how good of a set would it be. After all, a lot of trekkies have been complaining about the fact that some of the sets did not have the special edition DVDs. Another thing that I wasn't sure of was how good the price would be. Star Trek TV DVDs are outrageously expensive and for ten, two disc DVDs, 109 dollars is a pretty good deal. After all you are buying a piece of sci-fi history. <br /> <br />The legend of Star Trek lives on when the motion picture comes out in 1979. I really thought that was cool because technology wasn't very good back when Trek was in it's initial run. Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and everyone else may be older, but they still manage to keep on doing what they always did. I'll always love the Original Crew movies because they gave us a look at what the original show would've looked like had there been better special effects. The Wrath of Khan, and The Undiscovered County were my two favorites but there isn't one that I don't like from the original crew.  <br /> <br />The Undiscovered County made it clear that this would be the last performance made the original crew and it was time to pass the torch to Picard and the next generation crew. Generations had Kirk, Scotty, and Sulu in it but it was a Next Generation movie. I liked First Contact a lot too. A lot of people don't like Insurrection at all but I think it was a good movie, but there wasn't much in it that made it really stand out as a Trek movie. I liked Nemesis but I will admit that it was probably the worst one of the series. <br /> <br />This set is a really good buy because all of these movies have survived the test of time. Even though you don't get anything special buying this as opposed to buying them separately, it's an easy way to complete your collection. I'm really glad Paramount didn't screw this one up.
B000AP04FG|4.0|Mr. and Mrs. Smith are a beautiful couple who live in a beautiful home in a beautiful neighbourhood. Both work at successful everyday jobs. Or so they think. The movie opens with the Smiths sitting on a couch being questioned about their marriage by a psychologist who we never see (but is played by William Fichtner: Invasion, The Perfect Storm, Armageddon). When John and Jane met they had instant chemistry, drinking themselves blind and making out in the rain. After a few weeks they tied the knot. \\"Five or six\\" years later they fell into the suburb routine of getting up, going to work, having dinner and very little (if any) sex.<br /><br />They have both perfected their skills as liars and as deadly assassins. They botch a mutual job and in so doing learn that the other is also a hired killer. Even though they both lied, each feels deceived by the other but their relationship is the least of their problems. Because of this botch they have 48 hours to clean up the mess. Part of the mess involves getting rid of the other spouse. Sparks begin flying along side the many bullets they rain on one another.<br /><br />Right from the beginning I was laughing at their interaction between Jolie and Pitt. They are very funny, even when they are working (killing people, which sounds horrendous). The nattering between these two is reminiscent of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant. A few of the violent scenes with them kicking one another's butts made me wince, but overall were tolerable. Fun movie. I'm looking forward to seeing it again.
B000BUYP4Q|1.0|Am I the only one who didn't like this movie?  Why this was so critically accliamed is beyond me.  It was all...bleh.  The action, the characters, the acting, the dialouge......it was all bleh.  Sure, it may be the best Batman movie, but that's not saying much at all.  The talk was that this was going to be a dark and realistic movie.  I just saw it as another silly superhero fare.  I guess I just don't like superheroes.  If you want an interesting and dark action flick, check out the Bourne series.  Batman is just for little kids and comic book fans.
B000092ZYX|4.0|It has been trendy to knock Radiohead in recent years, yet that is because many people do not give their records a chance, i.e. they listen to it once and then claim its 'pretentious', 'pseudo-intellectual' or 'whiney' and 'boring'. These people miss the point. If you like uncomplicated, simple music with rhyming lyrics to match Dr. Seuss, then listen to Coldplay.  <br /> <br />But if you want a challenge, then buy 'Hail To The Thief'. Buy 'Hail To The Thief' if you are a fan of the simplicity of 'The Bends' and experimentation of 'Kid A'. Perhaps the fact that this record is like a portfolio of all of Radiohead's work to date, makes it look in some people's eyes, disjointed, or incoherent. Yet, like with all of Radiohead's records, they are hard to get into, but if you persist, they will reward you.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|I respect Mariah in many ways. She does have an amazing voice, and is bigger than life. BUT, all of her music sounds exactly the same. I cant tell one song from the other. Mariah has never been known to be original, but c'mon, for being a veteran of the music world, she should at least try. How many more songs about love and heartbreak is she going to sing about? I mean, hello, we get it...nobody loves you, shut up already! AND CAN WE PLEASE STOP with all of the rappers making cameos...it just proves that she cant hold a song on her own. And dont even get me started on her videos. She wears the same outfits in all of them. She is a tragic mess, and I really wish she would learn how to take some risks. And for the claim that she is the biggest selling female of all time. PALEEEEASEE !!! Its a proven fact that her Madgesty, MADONNA, has outsold, and outshined Ms. Mimi in very way. Madonna, unlike Mariah, isnt afraid to make changes. Whether it costs her sales or not, Madonna has always had the ability of keeping the world captivated by her every move. Madonna is an ICON, a true living LEGEND. People dont talk about Mariah in the same ways they talk of M. True, Madonna doesnt have the best voice, but as an artist, she is second to none. Mariah must be pulling her extensions out knowing that Madonna's latest album, CONFESSION ON A DANCEFLOOR, is a smash hit, debuting at number 1 in 28 countries. Mariah can NEVER boast that kind of acheivement. In the end, though, Madonna will stand the test of time, and poor Mimi will be washed away like the trash that she has become. ALL HAIL THE QUEEN GODDESS OF MUSIC, MADONNA !!!
073945529X|5.0|Blink! explores the phenomena we have all experianced, that initial feeling we get when exposed to something new.   <br /> <br />Initially I was a bit skeptical of the premise.  It sounded like one of the New Age self-awareness books.  I was mistaken.  Instead, Gladwell makes two, very important, statements.   <br /> <br />First, those gut feelings can be very accurate when an expert gets them.  That is, someone who has a lot of experiance with an item or situation is able to judge that situtation rapidly and fairly accurately.  Further, expertise does not mean college diplomas but experiance.  We are all experts, to a large degree, at reading faces because we have been doing that all of our lives.  So we can rapidly, subconciously, arrive at a conclusion about someone we meet for the first time because of their expressions.  Our brains perform activities below the conscious level, and our conscious selves can access the results.  (In a way, this is a neat argument for consciousness being an artifact of cerebration and not the other way around.) <br /> <br />Second, even experts can be fooled when the cues we subconsiously use to size up an item or situation lead us down a the wrong path.   <br /> <br />Blink! is about intuition, and illustrates the power, and flaws, with intuitive thinking.  It is another demonstration of the superior power of rational thought over intuition.
B00006879E|1.0|That is to say, it won't blow you away, and highly expendable. 1 star because Maroon 5 isn't terrible, but I assure you no one with respectable music taste would give this album a third spin.    \\"The perfect blend of melody and grit. One of the best live bands to come along in a while\\".    John Mayer said the above, which leads me to think that his music taste is poor and he has not heard any of the great live bands (Grateful Dead were legendary, for one). I will not criticise his music because I have not heard it, but his comments do make one wonder.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I liked this album a lot more than I did Avril's debut C.D. \\"Let Go\\", mainly because it contains a much higher number of hard guitar tracks (which I think she definitely excels at). Although many people may put Avril down after hearing the slightly bland hits \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\", one listen to Under My Skin in its entirety makes her skills as a musician seem much more plainspoken. \\"He Wasn't\\", for example, offers an energetic and fast-paced rock atmosphere that is great, but isn't shared by any of Avril's hits. The song \\"Forgotten\\" also helps contribute to the album's solidity in that it ventures into Avril's noise-loving side, blasting into forceful electric guitar and high-volumed lyrics which add some positive variety to the CD. Under My Skin also hosts the essential hit \\"Don't Tell Me\\", which may be among my top three favorite Lavigne songs due to its unique yet splendid lyrical flow. Overall, this album has a very good sense of rock and ought to be in any Lavigne fan's collection. I would also advise those who dislike the featured tunes \\"My Happy Ending\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\" to try Under My Skin out anyway, since in my opinion the non-hit tracks well exceed the quality of most of her hits.
0446310786|3.0|The story takes place in the south of the United States, before civil rights were the same regardless of the color of people's skin. This society is examined through the eyes of a young girl whose father is a lawyer who defends a black man who has been accused of rape. Deep thoughts, slow plot. Maybe the movie has more action.
B00005176F|5.0|Since Blur is my favorite band, it only makes sense that I would like a Greatest Hits CD, but there are actually a number of things to criticize about the Best of Blur. For one thing, this compilation was made before the Think Tank album came out. Thus, the somewhat significant Blur hit \\"Crazy Beat\\" is not featured on the Best of Blur: a shame since I would consider it to be a pretty good song by the band. Also, my three favorite Blur songs are not featured on this CD (I'm Just A Killer For Your Love, Brothers & Sisters, He Thought of Cars). I strongly believe they ought to have been included, though, because these tracks seem to most clearly display Blur's skills in that they all have amazingly catchy rhythms, dandy lyrics, and are completely original and unique. Contrary to what others say, I don't think Blur is anything like Oasis. Sure, they're both British, but Blur has much more originality, more noise, and a bit more cleverness (although I do really like Oasis too). Anyway, the Best of Blur does have its upsides too. It does after all include the non-album song \\"Music Is My Radar\\", and compile a few of the band's best songs. There is of course the track that made them famous: \\"Song 2\\", as well as their mellow yet really good song \\"Coffee and TV\\". Some selections are really crappy, though, such as some of Blur's weakest attempts at soft songs (No Distance to Run, To the End). When push comes to shove, though, this is a quite commendable \\"best of\\" CD that Blur fans ought to try out for the hard to find single \\"Music Is My Radar\\" (although it's not that great of a Blur song) as well as for the Live C.D. that comes with it, if you choose to check that version out .
B0007GAERG|3.0|I'm a huge soul music fan (especially 70's soul) always looking for a great new soul album but I can never find one. Mimi has five strong tracks here (We belong together, Mine again, Stay the night, Circles, Fly like a bird) that make the cd worth checking out. If she just put as much care into her material as she does with the way she looks on her album covers (no complaints there), she might become a classic soul singer. She definitely has the pipes. Mariah badly needs to distance herself from today's pseudo-soul novelty acts (like Nelly, Snoop) and get some world class musicians around her. Until then, her mostly cheesy material will continue to keep her from being taken seriously by real soul music lovers like myself.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|What a disappointment! After hearing Slipknot's hard core hits \\"Duality\\" and \\"Before I Forget\\" off this C.D., I expected that the rest of the album would probably be equally glorious. Instead my ears were insulted by track after track of senseless shouting and uninteresting rhythms, which basically seemed like they had been made up on the spot. Pretty much the only good non-hit melody is \\"The Nameless\\", which is a lot less loud but has a better sense of beat than most of the album has. It is a shame that Slipknot has so many random and slapdash songs, for this seems to hide the skill of the relatively talented guitarists in the band. I would quite definitely not recommend this C.D., but I would suggest that the singles be bought separately since they stand out quite prominently among the non-hit tunes.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira looks so great as Eve holding the apple on the cover to her newest album.  And...what's up with that poor baby in the tree?  This album cover is absolutely fantastic, and has to be one of the best of 2005!  The music behind the cover is pretty good too.  \\"DON'T BOTHER\\" is a great song and video, with Shakira at her weirdest and best!  The rest of the album keeps a relatively good balance between catchy dance tunes, grinding rock numbers, and a ballad or two thrown in for good measure.  If you are looking for a great Christmas gift this year, give this album!
B00008J4P5|5.0|Like any other White Stripes album, Elephant is full of energetic rock. Starting off with the catchy hit \\"Seven Nation Army\\", Elephant blasts into many unchained noise sessions which rank among the best of the band's tunes. One of the best tracks, \\"The Hardest Button to Button\\" (which also has a pretty good video), contains a very low bass accompanied with a neat vocal effect, deliciously loud drumming, and Jack White's skillful guitar playing. \\"Black Math\\" is also one of the best songs on the album, featuring high speed guitar playing and a positive lyrical flow. The style of Elephant was overall a new thing for the White Stripes, and the great success of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" helped to establish the band in the modern music world. This innovative album should not be missed out on, for it is a significant notch in the group's progress. Buy it today!
0679422714|4.0|There has been a lot of controversy over this book, though some of it is questionable. A fair amount of the criticism seems to come from far-left sympathisers or nationalist Chinese that cannot accept that Mao was bad. In order to understand them, you must look at how they talk about Iris Chang. There are significant academic flaws in her research, yet they robustly defend her against \\"Japanophiles\\" and \\"Imperialist Japanese\\". I wonder how they would have reacted if Jung Chang had been writing about General Tojo. <br /> <br />Still more comes from academics that are worried the book is too \\"biased\\". As a historian myself, I wonder how they can be quite so excited about that, given that ALL historical works are biased. For one thing, the writer has enough interest in the subject area to research it at all, and normally approaches the topic with pre-formed ideas and assumptions, even if they would not realise it. The general public may look upon \\"history\\" believing that it is about distinguishing \\"right & wrong\\", trying to be \\"neutral\\", etc. That is not the case - only armchair historians believe it. In the study of history, one must take any work with a pinch of salt. <br /> <br />\\"Mao\\" is in my mind mostly good, with some flaws from various scholarly mistakes. The \\"wave tactics\\" in the Korean War have been shown to be an exaggeration (the Chinese had numerical superiority but not in the vast numbers previously believed). But this book is still better than any other in demonstrating what Mao was really like. Philip Short said that Mao \\"was a great poet, a visionary and, I would argue, a military strategist of genius.\\" Well, I would argue that stating such things merely clouds the issue of Mao's role in setting China's development back 10-20 years, through the failed Great Leap Forward and chaotic Cultural Revolution. Mainland Chinese cannot read books that purport to be neutral, as their government controls academic discussion of Mao. So what they need, more than anything else, is a book to clearly set out his flaws and expose them to the harsh reality of daylight. <br /> <br />Mao: the unknown story has its flaws, as many have pointed out. But in the words of the Chinese Communist Party it is \\"70% good and 30% bad\\".
B000068OSK|5.0|Although there seems to be something wrong with the sound quality of this album, it is still an essential buy for any Stripes fan. Right from the start there is a hard rock atmosphere, but the absence of soft songs can likely be pardoned due to Jack and Meg's young ages at this point in time. \\"Astro\\", one of my favorite Stripes songs, has a great electric guitar beat going on that bears similarity to the Kings of Leon (yet the White Stripes came first) while at the same time Jack White is singing about people doing some apparent dance called the Astro. Then there is the great song \\"Stop Breaking Down\\", a real sticks-in-your-mind kind of tune that has playful guitar and a rather awesome rhythm. Every melody, in fact, has a good rhythm, and for this reason I would give the White Stripes' debut album a five star rating. Jet and Kings of Leon fans also ought to like this CD.
B00005JNX0|3.0|This movie is the best work that Dreamworks has come up with since \\"Shrek.\\" The story once again mixes a new fresh idea, cute animation, and a great all-star cast... I enjoyed this movie greatly as well as my younger brother.<br /><br />The story was charming... The characters delightful- i especially like nerotic Melvin- the giraffe and the penguins(I like so many others hope they make an actual movie about the penguins).<br /><br />The special features are amazing... the Christmas penguin short was especially endearing. The information on the cast and the making of was interesting for me- but, then again I'm also thinking of a career in animation.<br /><br />This is definately a movie to own in your collection or to buy for the kid in your life... Hit the buy now button this won't disappoint!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|This C.D. is probably one of my all-time favorites, mainly because of the music's extreme catchiness. Every song on this self-titled album has a great rhythm, a completely original beat, well-written lyrics, and a high repeatability factor. This album is very commendable for its many genres, also. While some songs are soft and dreamy (Auf Achse), some songs are completely the opposite, such as the peppy \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\": an upbeat tune with playful guitar and a wildly catchy chorus. Then there are the especially enjoyable hits \\"Take Me Out\\" and \\"This Fire\\", which both have a foot-stomping beat to offer as well as some considerably unique guitar patterns. Franz Ferdinand is an essential part of the new wave resurgence, and any proponents of this movement cannot afford to miss out on this album! The music of this band has already set the stage for scores of new music groups, and why not? It's great! I would give this C.D. a full five star rating for its clever and outrageously catchy melodies, and would recommend every track except for \\"Michael\\", which is good instrument-wise but has rancid lyrics.
B000001Y2U|5.0|The release of Antichrist Superstar was the height of Manson's Career, it encompasses such classics as Beautiful People and Antichrist Superstar.  <br /> <br />To Begin this review I would like to state that ys the album is dark and perverse but that is its intention after all it is metal music. Posting bad reviews and unopinionated reviews is unhelpful and people like that form the 'bad name' associated with Metal. <br /> <br />When Listening to this album I immediately fell in love with it it is alive with influence (after all music is PROGRESSIVE) and provides a sarcastic and twisted view at modern society and shouts out the dark parts of ourselves. If you can see past the 'label' created around 'Marilyn Manson' and compared it to other albums released at the same time and of a similar genre this album definately stood out.  <br /> <br />Otherwise why would the band be legendary for social criticism? <br /> <br />In ending I would like to say this must be one of my favourite albums of all time.
B0006213WG|5.0|I'm glad that Sum 41 decided to make a somewhat softer album, for even though I favor their harder side it was interesting to see how they did with a milder style of rock. As it would seem, Chuck hosts just as many great songs as the average Sum 41 C.D.: with a variety of them being even better than usual. \\"No Reason\\", for example, is perhaps my second favorite Sum 41 song due to its energetic chorus, meaningful lyrics, and catchy chord progressions. It surprised me greatly that none of the hits on this C.D. really took off like \\"Fat Lip\\" or \\"The Hell Song\\" did, because the unique yet rockin' music on Chuck seems like the kind that would hit it off well. According to the list of hits that comes with the album, \\"Pieces\\" and \\"We're All to Blame\\" were both released as hits: but I have yet to hear \\"Pieces\\" in the U.S. (since Sum 41 is from Canada, they play those guys 24/7 up there) and \\"We're All to Blame\\" hardly ever gets played where I live. \\"Pieces\\", although one of the band's softest morsels, has fairly heartfelt lyrics and calm electric guitar that ought to have gotten more radio time than it got. It bums me out a lot that this important album didn't seem to get too much attention. I would give Chuck a full five star rating, and would consider it essential Sum 41 music. Buy it!
074322454X|5.0|-I read this book after first watching the mini series, and I agree with an earlier reviewer that the movie was better than the book, but the book is still a worth while read. The book is written in a very conversational style, with lots of quotes and stories from the men that fought the war, and runs about 340 pages, all of which are fast paced and moving. <br /> <br />Taking the company thru intense drilling and training in Alabama, through the deployment, its various battles and finally the conquest and occupation of Germany, the book brings to life what life was like for the men of Easy Company there and their relationships between them. Particularily interesting where the letters and the diary of one of the men, Jackson, a Harvard educated soldier whose accounts and writing really helped make the book as personal as it was.  <br /> <br />The book doesn't devote a lot of time to the explicit accounts of battle, which I felt would have improved it quite a bit. It closes with a \\"where are they now\\" segment which I found interesting to see how the men spent the remainder of their lives. This aside, when reading, it is hard to not feel like you are with the men through the whole conflict which makes the book ahrd to put down.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very enjoyable read, and will give the reader a great insight to the men who fought the war and what their lives were like.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|If you are looking for a MEGA HIT along the lines of ORINOCO FLOW or ONLY TIME on Enya's new album- AMARANTINE, you won't find it.<br /><br />However, if your personalized homemade Enya greatest hits mixed CD includes songs such as ONLY IF, ANYWHERE IS, WILD CHILD, CARIBBEAN BLUE, & BOOK OF DAYS, what you will find on AMARANTINE are 3 songs similar to the ones mentioned above that will fit in nicely with those songs for your listening pleasure.<br /><br />ITS IN THE RAIN, LONG LONG JOURNEY, & AMARANTINE are 3 songs that I expect to get \\"single\\" consideration.<br /><br />All 3 songs follow the long time Enya formula of Layered vocals harmonizing over a catchy hook.<br /><br />The rest of the album is interesting & includes 3 songs (LESS THAN A PEARL, THE RIVER SINGS, & WATER SHOWS THE HIDDEN HEART) sung in a make believe language called LORIAN.<br /><br />Enya also succeeds in painting a very good visual picture in her songs. As you close your eyes & listen to AMID THE FALLING SNOW you hear the music & can visualize the snow falling around you.<br /><br />Overall AMARANTINE has been worth the wait for Enya fans & I would recommend buying it today.
B00006ADD5|3.0|The single best thing about this movie is its desert photography.  The story itself lacks intensity, which is surprising since it is about war.<br /><br />Lawrence is portrayed as someone who makes you say \\"what's wrong with that man?\\".  In some scenes, Peter O'Toole has an insane look on his face and behaves irrationally.  In some scenes he seems to think he is a god.  Then in some scenes he gives up, demoralized.  All in all, he is utterly confused and at times delusional.<br /><br />Why does a war movie appear so bland?  The victories that are won are apparently not important.  If they are of any importance, the film fails to show that to us.  There is absolutely no drama to any of the battle scenes.  There is no fear leading up to them, no intensity at all.  I fault the much heralded director for that, as well as the much heralded actors.  This isn't a bad movie but it is extremely overrated.<br /><br />Why do the Arabs keep calling him Aurence?  Is there no L in Arabic?  Why didn't the movie explain why the Arabs can't say the man's name, or why they chose to change it?<br /><br />The whole issue of Lawrence's capture and torture by the Turks was extremely puzzling and very poorly presented, not to mention poorly written.  First of all, what was he doing there?  Was he out of his mind?  Second, considering that he didn't make a sound under the whipping, why then did he utterly fall apart afterwards, and why did he say that he would have told them anything they wanted and betrayed all of his allies?  All we saw was that he was accepting the pain just as he accepted the pain of a lighted match earlier in the film.  What the hell happened?<br /><br />Why did he object so much when the Turk talked about his fair skin?  Why did he hit the Turk for that?  Was it meant as a homosexual come-on that Lawrence was objecting to?  I don't think so.  Why did Lawrence go nuts and hit the guy?<br /><br />This is one of those many many movies that are given credit as being among the greatest of all time, but clearly are not.  It's not a bad film though.  I give it three stars, which is exactly what it deserves.  It held my interest for nearly four hours, though it took about three sessions to get through it.<br /><br />It has the makings of a good film, but it is in dire need of a tremendous amount of editing and re-shooting.  It requires more intensity, more meaning, and more sense must be made of the title character.<br /><br />I must change something in this review.  The best thing about it is not the desert photography.  The best thing about Lawrence Of Arabia is the focus on camels.  Those creatures are weird as hell.  They look weird, they sound weird, their posture is weird, their facial expressions are weird, and seeing so many of them up close is the most fascinating thing about Lawrence Of Arabia.  The damn camels.  Amazing.it as being among the greatest of all time, but clearly are not.  It's not a bad film though.  I give it three stars, which is exactly what it deserves.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|This is a great Madonna album.  She really redeemed herself after the disappointing American Life album.  I love the fact that there are no ballads on it.  The songs all flow together w/o interruption which gives it great flow.  There are several candidates for singles.   <br /> <br />Hung Up really gets the album started right.  It's really hard to say which 3-4 songs are the best ones.  Decent but not great albums are defined by a few select tracks that everybody goes to when they put that particular album on.  COADF really has standout tracks throughout the album.  There are a couple of good not great songs.  However, there are no weak tracks here.  If the record company plays their cards right, this album can have 4-5 hits on it easy.  I see this being a huge seller for Madonna in the US and abroad....reiterating her position as the Queen of Pop.  <br /> <br />Go buy this album if you like the irrestible dance tracks she's given us over the course of her career.  This album will jump our of your speakers and make you want to dance.  Way to go Madonna.  She's showing the younger artists how it's done with great songwriting and great production.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|If you don't like these guys your not AmericaN.  The talent is just incredible.  Eddie shreds with the greats.  I think I also got to second base when I was 14 listening to when its love, lol!!!!!  I love these guys.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|if you ask people what they think of this album the initial general response is i love it or hate it. but one thing no one can disagree with is his voice is like nothing you have heard before.  <br /> <br />when i first heard 'you are my sister' i fell in love and the more i listen to it the more i love it. so i brought both albums and my admiration and love for his voice and lyrics grew. its one of those rare finds that make you wont to introduce him to everyone you know but in doing so ive found you have to be patient... i showed my boyfriend and his first response was  \\"does it get any better!\\" he hated it. but after hours of playing the album he grew to love it and i even saw a tear whilst playin 'hope theres someone' which struck him so deeply hes demanded this song at his funeral if anything should happen.  ive also played it to 3 friends and my mum and all had the same response at first but now they cant stop talking about it.  <br /> <br />so upon listening if your first thoughts are 'i cant listen to his voice' or you think the lyrics are a little unsettling and controversial, give it a chance listen to each song once or twice and if you dont grow to love it youll definately respect it.
B000001FOS|5.0|because I know that I will never be as good as the man.  Sick guitar playing.  I feel sorry for all the people that listen to rap who are missing out on a great.
B000004712|3.0|I mean - it's Herbie, so it can't be really bad, but.........\\"New Standard\\" seems a bit optimistic. <br /> <br />I have never heard so many errors in H. Hancock playing, especially over a comparatively easy piece like \\"Love Is Stronger Than Pride\\". <br />He completely screws it at 01.46 - 01.53, hits wrong keys again at 02.04 and some other places of the tune. I was a bit shocked. <br /> <br />Also, in terms of John Scofield, I somewhere read that since 1998 he is clean and sober.  \\"New Standard\\" is from 1996, and on this album, he definitely was clean and sober too, but in a bad way. Can't remember having heard Sco playing so flabby and dull on any other record to date. <br /> <br />M. Brecker on Sax, D. Holland on bass and J. DeJohnette are cool and play great, though.
B000AY3KN0|4.0|First I let me state for the record KING KONG is a Great Movie in any of the current versions. Cooper, Schoedsack, Rose and O'Brien proved themselves geniuses in creating KONG. My review is based on owning and viewing 3 of 4 Laser Disc and 3 VHS Releases. The 2 Disk Collectors Edition (T7431)is beautifully packaged in an embossed oversized tin. Within are 5 what appear to be Lobby Cards, and a  pressbook reprint. (The book contains story boards as well as cast and crew notes. Also included is a 1 sheet Movie poster offer($3.25) The discs are securely contained in very nicely illustrated foldout cardboard case     Now to the Discs themselves the film appears to me to be  identical to the earlier 60 Anniversary Laser Disc although run time is listed as 4 minutes longer. I must say I found the commentary track by Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston annoying, sounding as informative as an episode Mystery Science Theater. (Sorry Ray)The commentary done for Criterion Laser Disc by Ronald Haver superior in every way. The Audio is MONO and not the Stereo of the earlier 60th Anniversary Laser Disc. The follow on documentaries are well worth watching. The \\"I'm King Kong\\" profile of Cooper is great while The Making of... seemed a bit disapointing too many talking heads to many flashing cuts. It is still very good and loaded with information. I do have mixed feelings on the RECREATION of the \\"Lost Spider Pit Sequence\\"    The Creation Clip and commentary by Ray Harryhausen is excellent. MISSING IS \\"Turners\\" COLORISED Version of King Kong.      P.S.  If someone would like to see what the Willis O'Brien's \\"Lost Spider Pit Sequence\\" would of looked like. I recommend you view  O'Brien's 1957 \\"Black Scorpion\\".         So in short it is very hit and miss. This release is \\"good\\" but \\"not definitive\\"! This release is more about Cooper and less about the Wizard Special Effects and Willis O'Brien. True Cooper's life story is incredible and itself would be a great film.     As to the \\"Three\\" Different Warner 2 Disc packages released it a matter of preference The versions differ only in packaging a some      novelty items the Discs appear to have the same content.  King Kong (Collector's Edition)  $39.98 $25.99   King Kong (2-Disc Special Edition)  $26.98 $17.99  The third includes the same King Kong content plus the sequels  The King Kong Collection (King Kong 2-Disc Special Edition/Son of Kong/Mighty Joe Young) (1933)           $39.98 $25.99    Please notice many of the reviews were done before 22 NOV. 2005 release date.  Enjoy
0060764899|5.0|Every day, somewhere in the world, someone reads or revisits the overarching truth of Lewis's book - namely that Aslan was, is, and always shall be victorious. Though the wrapping paper of the gift that Lewis gave us in \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is itself quite nice (an approach fully and wonderfully informed by early to mid twentieth century British life), it is the gift inside of the wrapping that is the true source of the book's power. Neither unnecessarily subtle nor offensively overbearing, the Christian allegory that Lewis unfolds is strong enough to be apparent to one accustomed to Christian narrative and imagery while not so blunt as to take away from the reading experience of one without such a frame of reference. And, bonus of bonuses, it is all rolled out in an exciting adventure that is able to engage and entertain all manner of reader. 5 stars and more if more could be given.

1573301183|5.0|I've been a longtime AIC fan but never really felt the need to buy this Unplugged DVD. Only after hearing Pearl Jam's acoustic CD did I begin to want this DVD. I eventually did buy it and was moved beyond words by the performance. Layne and Jerry's voices playing off of each other created a mood no other Unplugged performance will ever rival, and the guitars, bass, and drums are all hauntingly beautiful. What makes this different from the much more publicized performance of Nirvana's is that this entire set is beautiful and mellow whereas Nirvana's changed between somewhat upbeat and then depressing. Through the entire run time each time you look at Layne you feel pain and emotion flowing through his voice, particularly in Rooster. There are no low points with this set, every song is played perfectly and fits with the other songs like it should, nothing feels out of place. Jerry's voice at no time overpowers Layne's, and it sounds great throughout. No bad things can possibly be said about this DVD, performance, or this band. This is essential listening, you can tell from the 5-star average rating after over 60 reviews that everyone loves this performance. It doesn't matter if you're a fan of AIC or a fan of grunge, if you have any feelings at all, you're bound to experience them while viewing this.
B000BKVQTS|5.0|For the person who wrote animal cruelty. There is such things as fake cats, cg graphics and robotics. They are not that stupid to do that to a real cat, so don't push your peta beliefs on everyone else. If you want to boycott it because you don't agree with it then fine, but don't force everyone else to.     Yes I did think that it was a little misguided in the ad. People assumed it would be alright to take kids to due to it being about fairy tales.... However I noticed a lot of reviews made bad comments saying that isn't how the fairytales went, it was awful blah,blah, blah. If you EVER do your investigating you will realize that the original storys were just has horrific as how they were offered in the movie.  Little red riding hood did get eaten, hanzel and gretle did get killed by the witch and all the other storys were like that.  There is books where the storys doesn't go as plan.  If you investigate you will realize the storys were changed later so they would not scare children.  If people cannot accept this then they shouldn't worry about seeing the movie ever again.    Now back to the movie, yes it was graphic with the cat scene as well as afew others, I suggest this as a renter for those who really disagree with the whole concept of the dark side of the storys or those who agree with the negative comments. As for those who enjoy action, horror,  dark movies, then by all means this is a buyer.    Video wise I give this movie one thumb up and I'll explain why. Graphically it was pretty good and and the effects or lack there of was alright but could have found better ways to do some scenes. Audio was average but I think that was because the theater speakers sucked. Acting was average.
B00004HYLF|5.0|While riding in a van one day in the later '70s, a bandmate stuck in an 8-track tape and said,\\"Hey nate, listen to this guitar player\\". After about 10 minutes, I was finally able to close my frozen jaw and wipe the drool from my shirt, and asked him if I could borrow it. He didn't get it back until I bought the album. <br />  It wasn't just the guitarist - the bassist blew me away! And all those synthesizer sounds that complimented everything perfectly. I didn't even LIKE synthesizers! It wasn't just the musicianship and cool sounds either. Even today when I plug in the remastered CD, I still feel like I'm sitting in front of an old console stereo. You know, the wooden box that had funky colored fabric speaker grille cloth on each side of the front, and had a flip top center that exposed the record player, 8 track player and radio tuner. Those things sounded SSSOOOO warm.  <br />   That clear, warm production drew me in as much as anything, and that feeling didn't get lost on the remastered CD. I've been a musician for 30 years and have listened to much music, but nothing has grabbed me like that day in the van. Romantic Warrior was the reason I bought so many Stanley Clarke albums and took me on a musical journey that I'm much the richer for. <br />   In a time when disco ruled, what a dramatic departure to discover a collection of Baroque tunes played at breakneck speed on rock n' roll instruments full of funk and experimentation. A huge chunk of great music from the last 30 years exists because of this album. And most people don't even know that RTF ever existed.    <br />   This ain't just a cool album, it changed my musical life!
B000002KAT|5.0|Astral Weeks is the first CD that I actually wore out, so many listens over the years. I hope Santa will bring me a new one. You cannot say enough about this album. The only album in my collection that is its equal is Requiem by you know who...Mozart.
B000021YQV|5.0|This was the first cd I bought of system of a down before I ended up having the whole collection. The first song that I heard that got me into this band was Toxicity! And all i can say is wowwww! This is the type of cd that all you have to do is just put it in the cd player and not even touch anything, well, except putting the volume up! For me, all the songs in this album are excellent, but i will give you my personal opinion on each one: <br /> <br />Prison Song - Excellent Intro, great message and full of energy. Its pretty self explanatory as to what the song is about, just listen to it and you'll see. <br /> <br />Needles - Another great song that talks about heroin. Great drumline and beautiful riffs. I love the ending, evrytime i hear it, I can picture Serj doing a russian dance! <br /> <br />Deer Dance - This is one of my favorites, talks about war and empires pushing the smaller countries around. My favorite part of the song is the break, when serj and daron sing together, \\"Pushing little children, with their fully automatics, they like to push the weak around!\\" and then after that part, all hell breaks loose..  <br /> <br />Jet Pilot - One of the weirdest songs in this album, to this day, i still dont know what the song is about. But its drumline is out of this world and has a middle eastern twist to it too.. <br /> <br />X - This song is awsome, full of energy, talks about genocide, very sarcastic when Serj says, \\"We dont need to multiply, Die!\\" John definitely earned his stripes with this track, He definitely knows how to make those drums smoke..  <br /> <br />Chop Suey - My favorite song on this album, alot of people have different opinions about what the song is about, but for me, this song is about terrorism. Its a song thats filled with emotions, you can tell towards the ending when serj and daron sing the final chorus. It gives me goosebumps everytime i hear it. This song will go down as one of their classic ones. <br /> <br />Bounce - One of the funniest songs on this cd, but with great aggresive drums and guitars..  <br /> <br />Forest - This song is excellent, great rythym... Its a very weird song, but im into weirdness, thats why i love it, Especially the beginning when Serj starts off, \\"COme with me my little child-ahhhhh!\\" Awsomeeeeeeeeeee! <br /> <br />ATWA - Stands for Air, Trees, Water, Animals. Talks about Charles Manson, oddly enough! Its a great and beautiful song. I love it how it starts nice and slow and melodic, and then it just explodes in fury! Also one of my SOAD favorites. <br /> <br />Science - I love this song, I connect alot with this song cuz i feel the same way. Science has made our world turn into total crap. This song also has a middle eastern twang to it. Great vocals by Serj.  <br /> <br />Shimmy - Another funny song by the ever so sarcastic band. Short and sweet! <br /> <br />Toxicity - Thanks to this song, I am a #1 SOAD fan. This song was the gateway to owning system's complete discography. The best song ever! Cleverly put together with a powerful message about evil society and urban life. A true classic ! <br /> <br />Psycho - This song is beautiful, packed with energy and strong vocals in the beggining. THe best part of the song is the guitar solo by the ever so great, \\"Daron Malakian\\". You rock dude! <br /> <br />Aerials - What better way to end the album, but with a masterpiece track. Excellent track, beautiful lyrics, astounding vocals by lead singer Serj Tankian. One of the most melodic songs in this album . And to top it off, they end it with a bonus track, with a middle eastern rythym to it. That track is commonly played during funeral ceremonies.  <br /> <br />So please, i will say no more. I hope that my review proved helpful and will make you run to the record store to get it. Enjoy ! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|4.0|Im a student at Dr.Pedro Abizu Campos Highschool And Im reviewing The Day After Tomorrow.I think this movie is very scientific because alot of these things can happen.For example the ice breaking up.Also Global warming does cause an ice age.Also the movie was good because it shows alot of things that can happen in the future. For example the oceans tempature can rise.But somethings are not possible,like The Thermohailing Belt can not just stop.the Thermohailing Belt might just slow down.Over all the movie was fantastic.
B000BM6AVA|2.0|I have been a System fan for a long time now, and each time an album comes out I fall in love with them more and more.  But this album I wasn't so happy with.  Suprisingly I feel that mezmerize was much a better CD then this one.  I don't feel that this album really represents System of a Down's real sound.  I'm also curious as to why the main vocals are being taken over.  Serj's unique voice really put the icing on the cake for this band, and I'm not hearing as much of him as I'd like to.  Overall, I'd say buy the CD just to support the band, but not for the music on the album.
0920668372|5.0|When I first read this book, I thought it was special, but when I saw it acted out on stage, there was not a dry eye in the place. IN fact, the speaker actually passed out tissues at the beginning of the play. To see real live people reciting and singing the words of this book was more than touching, it was almost bizarre. Talk about emotion and truth, this book has it all.
0380789019|3.0|There's a parallel fantasy world underneath our feet and above our roofs. It's a dark and dangerous place, akin to the \\"realm of faery\\" of ancient European folk tales.<br /><br />Most sane, respectable people aren't aware of the place. _Neverwhere_ follows the adventures of a white-collar office drone who, after an act of uncharacteristic bravery, finds himself drawn into the parallel world beneath London.<br /><br />It's a wonderful set-up, with vivid characters and settings, but ultimately I felt only moderately entertained by this one.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett will find _Neverwhere's_ style and feel very familiar. I'm frankly kind of burned out on snarky, arch fantasy. If this sort of work hasn't worn out its welcome, you may enjoy it more than I did.
0060764899|5.0|I must admit that the title \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is not what compelled me to read this book.  It seemed a bit too childish for me.  I am familiar with some of Lewis's other work, but this is my first trip to Narnia.  In preparation for the upcoming movie, I decided to make my first visit to Narnia.    Four Children staying in a mostly empty house can give rise to numerous potential adventures.  When a passage in a wardrobe closet leads to another world, a strange adventure is available to the children.  Narnia, where it is always been winter since the white witch became queen, has been awaiting the fulfillment of a prophecy.  When the four children arrive in fulfillment of the prophecy, they meet the mighty lion Aslan.  The great strength of this lion can only originate from one source than allows the witch to ultimately be conquered and the four children to reign as kings and queens of Narnia.    While this book is short and simplistic, the adventure has more than enough depth to capture the adult reader's attention.  While books with fauns and talking animals are normally not on my reading list, I have a great appreciation for this book.  There is certainly a reason this book has been treasured for more than fifty years and across generations of families.
B000002UA2|5.0|This is the soundtrack to the Barbet Schoeder movie \\"La Valle\\". It is their third soundtrack after the average Zabriskie Point and More. It was released during the golden Pink Floyd era, between Meddle and The Dark Side of the Moon. <br />Obviously, when a band records as many hits as Pink Floyd have, some albums get less attention. However, too often people overlook this one. Animals is a fantastic album that is highly overrated, mainly because of the fact that the songs were too long to get any airtime on the radio. Meddle is also underrated to some extent, but Obscured by Clouds, in my opinion, is the most underrated of all. <br />It is probably not the best choice for a Floyd newcommer, but for the one who has listened to the hits of 71-79, and who have overlooked this one, Obscured by Clouds is well worth purchasing. <br />When drummer Nick Mason was asked what he thought went wrong in this album, he said he thought it was a sensational LP, and right he was. This one ranks up with the best Floyd work and hopefully it will some day get the recognition it deserves. <br /> <br />So for the Floyd fans who have not heard this one yet, seriously consider purchasing it. You will not regret it. <br /> <br />For the Floyd newcomers, you should start by getting used to the Floyd with The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals and Meddle before trying any other Pink Floyd albums. The Wall is also good, with, amongst other songs, Comfortably Numb, which is often rated as one of the best rock songs ever. Echoes is also a good compilation because it covers songs from all the periods of the band. <br /> <br />But please do not overlook this one. It will be a big mistake.
0800130952|4.0|And now one of my favourite films! I know, I read the book as a kid, and I'm now in my early 20s, and it's the first time I've seen the film! Shocking. The reason I haven't bought the film before is it's so damn expensive! I grabbed it in my local supermarket for only five bucks, and have seen it since at full price! I'm so happy what a bargain.<br /><br />Back to the film, Danny DeVito really manages to bring Roald Dahl's brilliantly described characters to life. I was so shocked that the characters are brought to life and it's all thanks to the brilliant actors. Danny DeVito & his real life wife, Rhea Perlman, play Mr & Mrs Wormwood with such unbelievable nastiness, you can't believe it's actually Danny under that hat, and tacky suits. Rhea is about the worst looking blonde imaginable, with OTT makeup, and horrible clothes. And Pam Ferris, good lord! What a woman! She's like your worst nightmare, plus a bit more. The ever annoying Mara Wilson is less irritating in this, simply because Matilda is such a lovable character, but she is the perfect choice for Matilda.<br /><br />This film is simply magical, although predictable, but that's to be expected. All the best bits are kept in from the book, like the girl getting swung around by her braids, or the boy eating all the chocolate cake. That will make you feel sick! Ugh! This film belongs in everyone's film collection, and will leave you with a happy feeling inside.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A cross-genre scifi/western/horror/comedy from Joss Whedon that is brilliant in every aspect of the film.  The action is fast and intense (Summer Glau does some incredible work), the jokes are funny but advance the characters and the film, the moral ambiguity is realistic but just adds to the sense of people doing the best they can to take the \\"high ground\\" in a difficult situation, the grittily realistic special effects mix in so well with the story you almost don't notice they are special effects.  There's something in here for everyone.
B000069D4M|5.0|I've watched this with my Mom every Christmas since I was a little girl; the choreography and Sendak's fantastic artwork make it a blissful experience for any viewer, of any age. I am excited to see it becoming (hopefully? please?) available on DVD, and will certainly purchase a copy when it is.  <br />I heartily recommend this film without hesitation. It is the best production of the Nutcracker available on film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Better even than Revenge of the Sith, I have to say. It was truly amazing; I was blown away. I wasn't sure if the series could handle a movie, and I usually don't trust movies to be as good as the thing they're based on, but this one was absolutely incredible. Joss Whedon did an excellent job translating his series into a movie. <br /> <br />The series was one of my favorite TV shows for the short amount of time it was on. Surprising they took it off considering it was on FOX and FOX likes to put any old garbage on their station. I really think, and I'm a HUGE Star Wars fan, that this movie can match up against even Episodes 4-6 of Star Wars. It was so good, I simultaneously want them to make a sequel and dont want them to make a sequel. I want to see more of the Serenity and its crew, but I don't want them to get full of themselves and try to turn it into the next Star Wars. It's fantastic as is.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|This new CD returns Madonna to her rightful place at the top of the  dance charts with some of her best work yet.   <br /> <br />Standouts include Sorry, Get Together , Jump, & Isaac.   <br /> <br />Love the whole retro Farrah Fawcett look meets Saturday Night Fever dance studio in her new video, Hung Up. Break out those old curling irons, she's back and can still look & sound awesome at almost 50.
B000AP04FG|4.0|I actually loved this movie. I'm all for movies of any kind, but I really like action movies. This one actually was well thought out and well acted, unlike many, many action movies.  <br /> <br />This is also the first time where I could say I thought Angelina Jolie looked incredibly good, especially in the scene at the formal dance, which is somewhat shown on the cover. So that's another plus to this movie. But these two just have so much chemistry together that they make the movie work. Action-comedies usually turn into pretty cheesy affairs (such as Fantastic Four, written by the same guy who wrote this), but this one somehow comes across as more serious in nature, despite the high level of humor.  <br /> <br />This movie has something I can't describe that makes it great and highly entertaining. One of my favorite movies of the last summer, I reccommend everyone at least give this one a shot before dismissing it as just another cheesy action comedy. I think you'll find its very good and I won't have to try and describe what makes the movie so good, because I don't know what it is!
B0000541VS|5.0|This is an outstanding movie based on a true story <br />even though  the city of new york denies this ever happened. <br />You will not regret viewing this movie, it is a keeper.... <br />I have viewed it atleast 4 times, and I still get my <br />emotions going big time.  <br />If it had a 10 star rating I would give it that..... <br />
B00005JNQS|3.0|For the first fifteen minutes or so I found this movie to be for young children only, but it eventually gets going and there are some jokes for the adults as well. Rodney Copperbottom is a young robot inventor who leaves his small town to go to Robot City to work for Bigweld, the world's greatest inventor. When he gets there, the company has been taken over by a shiny, nasty robot named Ratchet. Ratchet is being guided behind the scenes by his mother who runs an underground lair that grinds up old, antiquated robots. Rodney helps Bigweld take his company back, gets the girl, gets new parts for his ailing father and makes a bunch of new friends along the way.<br /><br />The animation is good and the look of the robot towns is inventive. There are good voices here, Robin Williams, Ewan McGregor, Mel Brooks, Greg Kinnear and others. The overall story is a little thin and it isn't funny enough to be up there with Ice Age and Finding Nemo. Robots is a fun little movie, but not a great one.
B000BJS4SU|1.0|I get sick of all these people saying anyone who doesnt like this album is a \\"blues purist\\", or that we dont recognise the talent in JM. Well I am here to say that is a complete load. I love blues rock and people who innovate ( reread ...i n n o v a t e..) in the said genre. This album does nothing of the kind. What I hear is not the passion and emotion you people hear...i hear someone struggling to be something he is very obviously not...much akin to all these white kids trying to be black. Thats not to say you have to be black to play blues. There are numerous examples of white guys playing blues, and doing so quite well. Simply put, JM is not one of these. I hear no soul. The emotion you say you people hear comes off to me as contrived.The songwriting is uninspired, and the playing even more so. He does nothing new, and what he does do is done better by your average club player in Austin.
B00066N8JS|5.0|This is one reissue album you don't want to miss!  Trent Reznor is perhaps the only modern rock artist who understands what a remastered, reissued album truly should be.  And he went overkill with this one.  I will dispense with the track listing and musical critique and cut to what this reissue is all about: sound.  This version of the 1994 industrial music milestone has a standard cd audio layer, and also a multichannel / stereo SACD layer.  For those who may or may not own the original release, the remastering of the cd audio alone is worth the purchase.  For those with the proper equipment, SACD is what this album is all about.  The 5.1 mix is a revelation, taking full advantage of sacd's attributes.  An all out 360 degree sonic assault in the highest fidelity audio format avaliable to consumers today.  Even if you don't have a 5.1 surround speaker setup but happen to have a sacd decoding dvd player, the stereo sacd track is even a noticeable improvement from the cd layer, in terms of fidelity.  On the obsessive side, this album was also released as a dualdisc, featuring the same remastered cd audio on one side and the entire album in stereo AND 5.1 in advanced resolution (48khz/24-bit, if i'm not mistaken)  dvd-audio sound on the flipside.  If  you have any penchant for maximum fidelity surround sound of, finally, a great modern rock record (as opposed to jazz, classical, typical genres that call SACD home), this is one album you won't want to miss!
B000BC8TBE|1.0|2005 has shown the true side of mariah, and has shown her greed and hatred for her fans. She knows that they will buy anything that has her name on it, and she is effectively exploiting this!!!! <br /> <br />mariah is a ho ho ho ho ho ho!!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|It ocurred to me when this reissue was released.  A modern rock record from my childhood is receiving 10th anniversary reissue treatment.  My how time flies!  It only seemed like yesterday Rivers and the gang were jamming it out with Opie, the Fonze, and Mr. Myagi (may he r.i.p.) on MTV.  For those who remember, MTV once played music videos in the not too distant past.  And now, the great quartet known as Weezer is receiving royal treament.     <br /> <br />This is classic Weez at its best, and no weezhead should be without this release.  The sound quality is improved from the original release, and the packaging is wonderful.  Furthermore, the second disc contains many rarities including Suzanne (featured on the Mallrats soundtrack.)  My only minor gripe is Say It Ain't So is on the album disc in a remixed version.  And by remix, I don't mean a hip-hop or techno remix that is a complete overhaul of the original song.  The differences are subtle but quite noticeable for any fan who has spun this album as many times as I have.  Fortunately, it is present in its original mix on the 2nd disc.  For purists sake, I wish they would have swapped these.  Also, a hi-res 5.1 mix of the album would have been a welcome addition, but beggars can't be choosy.   <br /> <br />Needless to say, every track on here is a gem.  There is not a single piece of filler to be found anywhere within its short 10-track long 30min duration.  This is one of the few albums that fully meet my personal criteria for what truly great popular music should be:  The songs need to be timeless and memorable.  It also helps if the lyrics are singable.  Furthermore, it greatly helps if the lyrics are meaningful.  On top of that,  a great modern rock record should, well, seriousley rock!   <br /> <br />=w='s Blue album meets everyone one of these requirements with clever lyrics anyone can sing along to, and the Ric Ocasek production gives their Marshall stacks some serious crunch.   <br /> <br />One of the great rock records of modern times.

1400082773|5.0|I read this for one of my reading groups. Being the non-political person that I am, I was completely unaware of who this person is, but my very political girlfriend filled me in. Obama is currently a US Senator from Illinois and a hot guy in the Democratic party these days. After reading his memoir, I am a supporter. He has a fine sense of integrity and understanding about people though I fear that the political process in this country would kill that off in even the strongest individual. <br />  <br />In the early 90s, Obama was studying law at Harvard and became the first black man to be elected as President of the Harvard Law Review. The publicity engendered by this event brought him a publishing offer, so he wrote this story of his life up to that point. After winning the seat in the US Senate, the book was republished.  <br /> <br />Obama's mother was a white woman from Kansas, whose family moved to Hawaii when she was a teenager. There at the University of Hawaii, she met an African student from Kenya. They married and had Barack in the early 60s. But the father left when Barack was only 2 years old, to get his PhD at Harvard because his scholarship money was not enough to support a wife and child. Before he could complete his degree, he was summoned back to Kenya by his government and the marriage dissolved due to time and distance.  <br /> <br />So Barack was raised by his white mother and grandparents while his father took on the quality of a myth. When Barack was ten years old, his father came for a two week visit which only served to confuse Barack further. But he managed to complete highschool and college, by which time he had decided to live as a black man. <br /> <br /> After college, he went to Chicago to work as a community organizer in the ghettos of South Chicago and came face to face with the results of racism in a northern industrial city. Just before entering Harvard Law School, he finally traveled to Kenya and met his father's side of the family, finding at last the other half of his heritage.  <br /> <br />It was a fascinating book, written in a novelist's style and hard to put down. It added much to my growing fund of knowledge about Blacks in this country, their African forebears, racism and the long slow climb of the Black race in America from slaves to full citizens of this country; a climb which is far from over.  <br /> <br />I doubt that this country is ready to elect a Black President, but I am sure it will happen in my lifetime. If Obama can stay in politics and maintain the integrity he displays in his book, I would be glad to have him as President of the United States.
0767805712|2.0|Welcome to a not too distant future where genetically superior humans get all the good jobs, while those born naturally have to piddle their way through the mundane jobs.  Enter Ethan Hawke, the \\"human\\" who wants to go to Titan, one of the moons of Jupiter, but to do so has to convince Gattaca, the corporation involved, that he is a genetically enhanced human.  He \\"borrows\\" the vital fluids of a crippled VALID, played nicely by Jude Law, and manages to get to the top of the list of space travelers.  The murder of an important director, however, may be his undoing, as his true identity becomes more and more revelant.  Critically acclaimed as one of the more intelligent of sci-fi films of the nineties, GATTACA is competently done, with nice performances from Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin and Loren Dean, but ultimately its leisurely pace and lack of true surprises makes it merely an exercise in style with a potential message overshadowed by its manipulation.  Not one of my favorites.
0156012197|5.0|At first sight, The Little Prince might just be another children's book. While it is categorized as children's literature, it is something for all. The Little Prince, combining simplicity with a beauty of expression, celebrates the imagination of children, cherishment of peace, the beauty of the mind, the preciousness of childhood, and the human spirit as a whole. The book is, as you probably expect, evolved around a little prince, a young boy who rules over his tiny planet with two extinct volcanoes, and a little flower with whom he falls in love. The little prince eventually leaves his planet and goes off to others one by one. The satirical part of the book comes in when the little prince visits several different planets, each ruled by an adult. He encounters a king, who commands his subjects and yet have none to command; a business man who only cares about the numbers of stars he owns and yet owns none; a drunkard; a lamplighter who lights his lamp every half minute or so; and a geographer. The author in some ways, mocks the narrow minded, materialistic existence of the adult world while revealing the true worth to that idealistic, imaginary world of a child.  <br />          The book is truly touching, it is exquisite. The book is combined with little bursts of laughter, little drops of sadness, and an infinite realm of imagination and the same a celebration of the truth. Pick it up, for it brings us into a level of understanding, and a new perpective towards the world that we all live in.
B00062J00S|5.0|It may seem like a bit of hyperbole to state that \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is the best movie ever made, but if you strip away all of the hyperbole that surrounds this movie, you will see that the assessment of it being the best movie ever made is not far from the truth.<br /><br />Frank Capra assembled a truly ensemble cast who do more than just act, they become the citizens of Bedford Falls. Each character is fully developed right on down to the bank examiner who comes to inspect George Bailey's delinquent accounts and, thus, creates the crisis for George Bailey. The principal actors are brilliant but none more that James Stewart. Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is breathtaking. Stewart takes on a tour deforce as the viewer becomes privy to George Bailey's descent into the personal hell. Bailey believes he has reached this low point in his life because he was too busy taking care of everyone else and spending so little time and resources on the betterment of his own situation. Having been convinced by Mr. Potter, the resident curmudgeon (played admirably by Lionel Barrymore) that Bailey was worth more dead than alive, Bailey first attempts to take his own life, then being granted the wish that he'd never been born and ultimately concludes with Bailey standing on a bridge pleading \\"Please! I wanna live again. I wanna live again. Please, God, let me live again.\\"<br /><br />Along the way, we see that the people George had helped out in his life suffer immensely by his absence and we learn from Clarence, George's guardian angel that \\"Each man's life touches so many other lives. When he isn't around he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?\\" We also learn that \\" no man is a failure who has friends.\\" It are these friends who rally to Bailey's cause and give so much to the man who has given them so much.<br /><br />\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is a christmas movie in that there are themes of self-sacrifice and concern for your fellow man but it is also a movie that was set during christmas in that its themes extend well beyond the confines of christmas.<br /><br />It is ironic that one reviewer stated \\"In lesser hands this theme [every person has an impact on their community] could have been greeting card hokum.\\" In fact, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" began as \\"The Greatest Gift,\\" a short story written by Phillip Van Doren Stern. When there were no magazine takers for his short story, Van Doren Stern had a couple hundred copies made and sent them to friends in their Christmas cards.

B0007M22TI|2.0|As per the reply from someone from the Celtic Woman production team, to whom I had written to inquire about the lip-synching issue, the audio heard on the DVD is not necessarily the same that corresponds to the images, meaning that it is dubbed and edited over the video. In addition, the images on the DVD are from different shows, and they are all edited together to make it seem as if they were all from the same concert. Here is a copy of the reply they sent me:    \\"Putting together DVDs and albums are very complicated and take many months of work. The DVD is shot over a number of performances, and sometimes the audio may come from a different performance and therefore may not exactly match despite the best technical efforts.\\"    So what this means in plain terms, and I explain it for those who are so emotionally overwhelmed by the concert that they can't see straight, is that the DVD editing team took the sound recording of one concert, and put it over the images of another concert, and combined it so that the sound you are hearing as the singers perform on the DVD is not the actual sound that corresponds to the video. Also, as the email indicates, as you watch the concert progress from one song to the next, you could be seeing different concerts altogether that could've taken place weeks or months apart. All this amounts to a reprehensible misrepresentation by the producers of the DVD, in that it misleads the viewers into thinking they are watching and hearing the actual concert as it happened, rather than a dubbed-over production. No wonder there are so many discrepancies between the voices and the images, as the artists 'sing'. It is unfortunate this is so. The music is beautiful, and there certainly is talent there, this is why I am disappointed (In contrast, I could care less about Ashlee Simpson lip-synching on SNL; low talent=low expectations).    I think the producers of Celtic Woman should have just recorded a single concert, with or without flaws, and presented it as is, keeping the post-production editing to a minimum. This is what makes a live concert special; it doesn't have to be perfect, and anyone with half a brain will understand that. If we want a perfect recording that's what the studio album is for. So the bottom line is, if you're going to buy this DVD you should be aware that this is not a true live concert, in that the music you are hearing does not come from the same concert you are watching.
B0002JP4L4|5.0|This is easily one of the best films of the 80's. Kevin Bacon is a GOD in this movie. He plays a total renegade that swigs booze and dances like the devil.

055380457X|3.0|I agree with other critical reviewers that the details of Google's success are missing.  <br /> <br />This includes how Froogle works, how the library scanning project is managed, how math plays a role, how spiders operate, whether the histories retained about individuals' searches can be subpoena'd, whether there IS a privacy concern about GMail's archives  ... <br /> <br />Prior comments are entirely correct that the author can find nothing Brin or Page ever did that was or went wrong. When Page sat down in a bowl of \\"creme fraiche\\" at NYSE, it was seen as a spoof of the grown-up world of business. When GMail privacy concerns arose unepectedly, the concerned libertarians are viewed as cynical anarchists rather than legitimate tech. critics. <br /> <br />I did enjoy the story, though. I've been a fan for years (& years), and was interested to hear the company's story. <br /> <br /> <br />The story remains worth the read, but the tone is entirely uncritical and less informative than we need.

B000AP04FG|4.0|Will this movie win Oscars for its screenplay or story? No.<br /><br />But is this movie one of the best guilty pleasures of the year and a great popcorn movie? Yes!<br /><br />While Mr and Mrs Smith wasnt an unforgettable movie, it was still a tremendous ride.<br /><br />The chemistry that destroyed a marriage is fun to see and they worked great together. There are numerous laughs to be had throughout by both characters. Plus, Angelina looks pretty darn good in this flick...<br /><br />The action scenes arent anything you havent seen before like the 2 vs 100 shootout or the typical car chase scene. But what makes them work is the comedy thrown in during these so called serious life and death shootouts. Its adds a light and quirky sense of humour to most every scene.<br /><br />Combined, this movie doesnt add a whole lot of new stuff or break any new ground. But in the end the sum of its parts equals out to be a thoroughly enjoyable action/comedy with two of the biggest stars out there.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|Like a lot of people, I have been waiting for this long overdue DVD release. I'm not a huge George Harrison fan, but having been stunned after seeing the original cinematic release all those years ago, I was both excited and a little afraid when I saw it is now available. Excited for all the reasons outlined in the other reviews and afraid because so much older material now out on DVD has dated badly or is poorly produced and doesn't live up to my archived mental expectations (it's called nostalgia). <br /> <br />Not the case with this one. Yes, the picture is a little grainy, yes PA systems and recording facilities are better these days, but the quality of material and musicianship has withstood the test of time. This was the first major coming-together of headline stars for a worthy cause and with the possible exception of Leon Russell's young blonde-haired guitarist, all egos are left at the door in favour of the concert and it's message. I love the original Woodstock and live DVD's that I have of Jethro Tull, early Santana and the Grateful Dead, but there are moments where one gringes (the days before electronic guitar tuners and 60's and 70's cool  jargon). No cringes were noted during the watching of this DVD. Even people I've leant it to who weren't even born when it was made, enjoy it. It's bloody fantastic !! Thank you. Now all we need is a full digitally re-mastered official release of the Let It Be movie, and I can die a happy man.  <br /> <br />

B000ASATYO|5.0|Before Heavenly Creatures was released, which is long considered one of his best after Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson made splatterhouse style films such as Braindead. Then he made Heavenly Creatures which was very different but would he go back to the style he started with? Kind of. Awhile later he released the Frighteners which wasn't a box office hit but certainly had a fanbase. When DVD first started, the only special features were theatrical trailers. Now with jam-packed bonus discs, Frighteners gets the DVD release it deserves.<br /><br />Frank Bannister can see spirits so to finance building his home he has a plan: befriend ghosts and use them to \\"haunt\\" someone's house, he comes over and exercises them. Only people are starting to suspect maybe he's not who he claims to be. So when people start dying of having their hearts squeezed, he becomes numero uno for suspect. Only it's not him: it's a Grim Reaper-like figure. Next on his list is Dr. Lucy Lynsky, a woman who believes him so he has to not only save her but stop something already dead.<br /><br />The film works very well because it mixes the horror elements(that jump when the Reaper first comes out of a mirror still gets me) with comedic elements such as a ghost having his way with a mummy skeleton. The film in a way takes itself seriously to make you like and cheer for the characters but also not to much so that it's just unintentionally laughable.<br /><br />Performances are great all around, with mention to Trini Alvarado who unfortunately isn't heard from all that much because she's very believable. Also Jeffrey Combs playing probably the most demented and odd FBI agent you'll ever see.<br /><br />As for the unrated stuff, it's just extra scenes or even a bit of dialogue trimmed out. It adds to the characters well(although an early \\"Grim Reaper\\" appearance kind of cheapens the real appearance since the fake first one makes you think later ones are fake too). By the way: for people looking for Peter Jackson's cameo, he's the heavy metal guy Frank bumps into.<br /><br />Most special features are several things that can be viewed separately. For people who saw the Empire of Dreams documentary from the Star Wars trilogy: you think that was long? This is 4 HOURS of a documentary. It's massive. In fact, it's possibly too big. There's so much detail you could probably make your own Frighteners.<br /><br />It's not Peter's best but it's certainly an enjoyable film. Now bring on a real Heavenly Creatures release.for Peter Jackson's cameo, he's the heavy metal guy Frank bumps into. <br /> <br />Most special features are several things that can be viewed separately.

B00005JO1J|5.0|Suffice it to say that the movie version of \\"Rent\\", nine years after it exploded on Broadway, delivers the goods in late 2005. That in itself is no small feat since its then-topicality brings the story a somewhat tainted 1990's time capsule feel. Credit needs to go to director Chris Columbus, who has the audacity to bring back six of the eight original cast members and does surprisingly little to alter the story structure for the screen. The late Jonathan Larson's energetic, hook-heavy music is what made the show so memorable to me when I saw it during its first year in New York, and the now-familiar score still maintains its searing drive as it flows through the episodic story of almost starving artists living in the squalor of Manhattan's Alphabet City in 1989 with the AIDS epidemic running rampant (currently the neighborhood is going through significant urban renewal). In fact, four of the eight main characters are HIV-positive, and this makes the story resonate as much as the vital music does today.<br /><br />Having the cast return to roles they originated nearly a decade earlier when they epitomized twenties angst is a risky move as the characters would seem to be less compelling inhabited by actors now in their mid-thirties. As it turns out, age is not the issue versus the ability of the actors to generate the excitement they did onstage. Their contributions at minimum are solid and effervescent with some standing out, for example, Anthony Rapp as Mark Cohen, the geeky documentary filmmaker who records the lives of his friends with candor and regret. Jesse L. Martin - he of the dazzling smile and honey-coated baritone - seems genuinely liberated from years of button-down civility on \\"Law and Order\\" to play computer programmer Tom Collins smitten with drag queen Angel portrayed with unbridled pride and poignancy by Wilson Jermaine Heredia. Martin's and Heredia's giddy duet, \\"I'll Cover You\\", is full of such romantic fervor that other more traditional couplings can only aspire to such dizzying heights.<br /><br />Idina Menzel plays the bisexual performance artist Maureen Johnson with real brio though she seems a bit over-the-top even when not performing her supposedly avant-garde work, \\"Over the Moon\\". Despite nailing his passionate solo, \\"One Song Glory\\", Adam Pascal looks somewhat lost in his portrayal of Roger Davis, the tortured singer-songwriter who begrudgingly falls for Mimi Marquez, the borderline junkie/exotic dancer downstairs. With her saucer eyes and flirty demeanor, Rosario Dawson replaces original Daphne Rubin-Vega as Mimi, and she turns out to be an excellent choice, showing off unseen singing and dancing skills within the context of the most screen-savvy performance of the cast. She does an appropriately saucy turn on the showstopper, \\"Out Tonight\\". Rounding out the principal cast are another newcomer, Tracie Thoms, a belter who plays Maureen's lover yuppie lawyer Joanne Jefferson (and consequently wails with immaculate bravura the bridge to the show's most famous song, \\"Seasons of Love\\"), and Taye Diggs, who manages to make the most of the relatively thankless role of Benny Coffin.<br /><br />No matter the variability of the acting, everyone sings with glorious power, a fact made clear at the outset by Columbus, who smartly has them sing \\"Seasons of Love\\" in the manner it was introduced onstage with spotlights on a darkened stage. He also takes cinematic liberties which work in some of the numbers retranslated into the film, such as \\"Light My Candle\\", \\"Tango: Maureen\\" and \\"Take Me As I Am\\". Some like the centerpiece ensemble, \\"La Vie Boheme\\", work almost the same way they did on stage with its sheer exuberance intact. Some scenes don't work as well, for example, \\"What You Own\\" where Roger is literally living out the symbolic lyrics in Santa Fe. With its more naturalistic tone in spite of the numerous breaks into song and dance, the movie reminds me less of Robert Wise's and Jerome Robbins' adaptation of \\"West Side Story\\" than of Milos Forman's take on \\"Hair\\". Be forewarned that those who loved the stage version are the ones who will most be in thrall over the film version. That would include me.Milos Forman's take on \\"Hair\\".

B000AGTPUA|3.0|Director Robert Zemeckis' films have always used the latest in technology to bring a new way of approaching special effects. The process of animating toons in Who Framed Roger Rabbit without the grain from earlier attempts worked beautifully while Forrest Gump used old archival footage and matched it with recently shot footage and you literally can't tell the difference. Using the book of the same name for inspiration, he brings in a new technology(or let's say a revamped one) that while it does have the visuals, it lacks what should be in a Christmas film: heart. <br /> <br />Hero Boy(I'm literally not making this up, that's how he's credited) is starting to not believe in Christmas. So the titular train stops by picking up other kids who don't and takes them all the way to the North Pole. It's a weird concept personally: rather than let the kids just not believe, it's like \\"alright kid get on and we'll prove to you Santa exists\\". The entire trip takes up the bulk of the film as they go through mini-adventures before reaching the North Pole. <br /> <br />First thing I have to say before I start listing complaints is the visuals: holy crap these look awesome. This film is literally reference quality if you want to test your new TV. The train is quite detailed, the colors, the landscape all has topnotch quality written on it. I'm going to mention the actual characters next because that's where it falters. <br /> <br />One common complaint in reviews was the way the characters looked, especially the eyes. They look rather lifeless and without a soul, as if you were staring into a doll. When the Jolly Fat Man shows up, to me he literally looked like a mannequin. Also mouth movements looked incredibly strange to me. The idea of using \\"performance capture\\" it's the same as motion capture but also capturing the faces is a relatively new technology(the same technique was emplored to bring Gollum to life in the Lord of the Rings trilogy) but the execution is still off. <br/> <br />Another complaint I personally have is the padding of the length. It's literally a 45 minute film stretched out twice the size, you can notice scenes just seem to be put in to expand the length(such as a rather lame hot chocolate song). Also hearing Tom Hanks' recognizable voice coming out of no more than 5(!) characters takes you out of the film a bit. He does an excellent job with Santa though, the only time I couldn't tell it was him. <br /> <br />Now the ever important question: since it's designed to be a holiday film does it work. In a way. Kids will love it. It's got the magic and splendor that Christmas should have although they might find it a bit too suspenseful, especially when the train starts to speed up. Buy it for the kids but as an adult watching it, the flaws will be easily detectable.
6304076517|1.0|Truly one of my favorite movies of all time, marred by an ugly, blurry, muddy, pan/scan VHS transfer.  I'd advise you not to buy this and instead urge the studio to release a DVD in the US.
B000068TPN|5.0|\\"...If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood <br />Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs, <br />Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud <br />Of vile incurable sores on innocent tougnes...\\" <br />              -Wilfred Owen, from his 1917 poem \\"Dulce et Decorum est\\"  <br />I know this is a movie review, but the movie is based on a terrible mistake in history that we still have not learned from, and the historical lesson is more important than the showbusiness. <br /> <br />WE WERE SOLDIERS is a much-needed wake-up-call.  It is a blood-splattering nightmarish accurate depiction of what happens when the United States government goes deaf, blind, and mentally insane all at the same time (i.e. seeing the apparitions of groundless fears).  Aside from the 58,000 American boys just like me who were slaughtered to shreads of dead hamburger meat and the 300,000 who were wounded physically and corrupted mentally, betrayed by the murderous country they fought for, the American military killed three million north Vietnamese who had no imperialistic intentions but instead simply wanted their own country once and for all, free from French occupation.  Ho Chi Minh was not a bad guy at all; he wanted a peaceful, unified, INDEPENDENT Vietnam free from foreign influence and had before the war been willing to embrace any system of government-- anything, even DEMOCRACY-- to accomplish this.  The US did not JUMP on this diplomatic opportunity because they had forgotten or ignored the fact that HO CHI MINH HAD PRAISED THE UNITED STATES' 1776 DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE AND EVEN EMULATED PARTS OF IT IN HIS OWN 1954 VIETNAMESE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE!!  We had the chance to negotiate, to have given him a full copy of our document so that he could have seen what he could do with it further, and war would have been avoided-- sooo easily!  So Ho Chi Minh signed on with the communist party because they were the only ones willing to be tough with the French and to strive for a unified, independent, non-imperialistic Vietnam.  As for the US: Folly? yes. Debacle? certainly. MISUNDERSTANDING? Yes, most of all!. <br />The Vietnamese today, rightly so, call this war \\"THE AMERICAN WAR\\" which is of course a better name for the war because the Americans were the evil agressors in a foreign land of innocent defenders. <br /> <br />A movie, based on reality, well done.  Highly recommended.  Every American should have to go through the pain of watching it, along with the other esteemed movies about the Vietnam, I mean, American War. <br /> <br />Peace and knowledge to all.
B000002699|5.0|Miles always let the music do the talking, so my advice is just listen to this album. Nevertheless, I will bang on about it a bit, just like the others. <br />This is a CD I put on after I come back from the pub, or club at night when I've had a few drinks or whatever. Somehow it just calls out to me \\"Luke... Luke... PLAY ME\\" and I do. It never fails to move me (and sometimes physically). It is a strange, dark brew of textured piano and electric piano riffs and some minimal rythmical work by Williams and Holland, with Miles gliding over it like only he can and John McLaughlin creating great atmosphere with some wonderful guitar work. It is raw, like most Miles Davis stuff, but also very smooth and peaceful - with a kind of dark streak running through the middle. Quite unlike any music you will hear these days, bar perhaps Aphex Twin. <br />When I first got this album I thought it was incredible and powerful and was even quite scared of it for a while - it seemed to possess some kind of quiet voodoo power. There is magic in this music, definitely. But, over the years I have listened to it regularly and it continues to give me warm pleasures. Every listen becomes a rich, rewarding experience. It is a real grower, and calmer than most of Miles' other fusion work. It is a good companion to \\"A Tribute To Jack Johnson\\" (Mainly because of the presence of McLaughlin on guitar), although this album is far less aggressive, and more gentle and mysterious. The album will take you on a pleasant little journey down a bubbling creek, in the middle of the night...
1594200653|3.0|First, this is a magisterial book written by a writer who has always been brilliant, as a reviewer and as a historian.  But I'm surprised he (and his publisher for that matter) have not been taken to task for not including endnotes and a bibliography in the book.  No matter what the stated reasons for not including it -- there's a footnote in the book that explains the author's rationale for excluding them -- I think it borders on the scandalous that they're not there.  Even more inexcusable is the fact that reviewers in major newspapers and book review journals have not even mentioned the glaring absence of such important pieces of scholarship.
B00097DXZS|2.0|while certainly not Santana's best cd, the copywrite protection thing is a nightmare.  I \\"installed\\" (not by my choice) this on my laptop to listen to it and it worked the first day, but never again.  what a nightmare.  I don't have any interest in watching anything on a music cd (they should really offer different versions so people can choose) so the software included was not only worthless but a serious problem.  I was going to buy 2 more copies for people for christmas presents but I wouldn't do this to them.  Maybe they can just download the songs from applemusic.  geez, i won't ever buy another cd like this and frankly, i'd like my money back or to get one that doesn't do this garbage!
B000BNTM96|5.0|Buy this now. I don't write reviews because I am really really lazy. After watching the DVD, my hands were forced. Buy, grab a beer, grab anything else you're into and pop this one in. Prepare to be amazed.
B00000255F|1.0|Seriously, people, if you really gave this album five stars, you need to sit down with your therapist.  I mean, Bruce was a Democrat and all, but his music was pretty cliched and trite.  Simple minded music for simple minded people.  To tell the truth, \\"Born to Run\\" is even worse than \\"Born in the USA.\\"  For REAL music, get the latest by Madonna: her sensational \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor.\\"
B000003TA4|2.0|nirvana is another overplayed band. I hear them on every radio station in the world and they only play 2 albums, this and In <br />Utero. Plus I'm glad Kurt Cobain died because he didn't ever make <br />good music. He was always out of control the first time I heard <br />this album, and this and Use Your Illusion CDs from Guns N' Roses <br />ruined rock music. This album has a few good songs like Smells <br />Like Teen Spirit, and Come As You Are. I think the thing with <br />radios is that radios need to stop playing Nirvana 7 days a week. <br />Because Nirvana sucks!!!! OVERRATED TOO. Just like AC/DC. <br />Buy something from Dire Straits.
B000002572|5.0|Hey, I have a question to the world. How can you hate Boston? How can you hate Journey? How can you hate Kiss? Don't you people want some answers to those questions? I do. Man, some people these days. <br /> <br />Anyway, I am here to review an album, not people's opinions, because I can't judge them, neither can anyone else. Anywho, I love this album. What Tom Scholz did was incredible. He's like the Renissance man. He could do everything, guitar, piano, bass, drums, everything. Maybe he thought he would die early, since he had to get everything done. Haha. Only kidding there. Here's my opinion of all the songs, out of 5. <br /> <br />More Than A Feeling 5/5- This is mos def a terrific song. It's got alot of art. It reminds you of summer, but also a girl. Most songs are just like, oh my goodness, she broke up with me cry cry. But this! This is just alot of stuff mixed together to make a great summer song. Terrific. <br /> <br />Peace of Mind 5/5- I love this song. The little riff in the beginning and the end is catchy, and fun. I never get bored of this song. Never have, and never will. They've got some acoustic guitar in the beginning. Another terrific song. <br /> <br />Foreplay/Long Time 5/5- This is a catchy song. But I am sorry to say, to the world, it's not one of my favorite songs on the album. I know how everyone loves this song, and I am sorry. It is catchy though, don't get me wrong. <br /> <br />Rock 'n' Roll Band 5/5- Ha, what a terrific song. Very catchy, and makes you jump. It's the early beginning of Boston. Bravo. Ha. <br /> <br />Smokin' 5/5- Wonder why this song is called smokin'? Listen, and you'll find out. Ha. Seriously, it is smokin'. <br /> <br />Hitch a Ride 5/5- Another great song. Catchy and fun. <br /> <br />Something About You 5/5- This song is extremly great for a reason. The song first starts up at the first 27 seconds of the song with a riff. At about 18 seconds later, Brad Delp comes in with there powerful vocals which make me go WOWZA. The lyrics and vocals are terrific. Very powerful indeed. <br /> <br />Let Me Take You Home Tonight 5/5- You could say this is like a Bob Marley song. Has that great percussion sound and everything. Great lyrics. <br /> <br />Basically ladies and gentlemen, this album is a masterpiece. I don't mean to put anyone down, but to those who really don't like these guys, or Kiss, or Journey, or any of those terrific bands that make history, needs to get a life. I'm sorry. Alright, this is Charles, Peace.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|Me and the wife just finished \\"The Polar Express\\" and we both thought the same thing, that this was one of the most beautifully made movies the two of us have ever seen. I am a Christmas fanatic, and this ranks right up there with some of the all time classics. Why not 5 stars you may ask? Well, simple, as you know, I rarely give 5 stars to any movie or game, and the only Christmas movie I would ever give 5 stars to is 'It's a wonderfull life', answer your question? good, moving on......<br /><br />Tom Hanks does the voices for 5 characters I believe, and he does them pretty well, but you can tell its him in all of them, so thats not so good, but besides that minimal flaw and very few others this CGI miracle is amazing. Now, I am not a huge fan of CG, in fact, I find it ruins alot of decent movies, but not in Polar Express. The CG is breath-taking, the snowstorm is astonishing and the train itself is a wonder to behold. The colors are bright when need be, and quiet and deep in the more emotinal scenes. The 3 main child characters are all delightfull, the only exception being a loud, obnoxious, nerdy kid along for the ride who didn't really fit and was not necessary. If they needed comic relief in the form of a sidekick why not have a dog or even a cat along for the ride, that is always a good fit, especially in a Christmas movie.<br /><br />Another one of my slight flaws is that the expressions on most of the characters don't change much, but it's really not a big deal cuz' you are too busy ooing and awing over every brilliant scene or location. Not only is the train a spectacle but once they arrive at the North Pole, it gets even better. The imagination that went into this is one-of-a-kind. I don't think we are going to see another movie as visually stunning as this in quite a long time.<br /><br />Is this the best CG movie I have ever seen? pretty close race, but I'd give the edge to Nemo, so it gets a strong 2nd place, It's better then both Toy Story's (both are amazing 4 star movies) and a little better then Ice Age or Monsters, Inc. I know there is more of them, but they are mostly 3 stars and below.<br /><br />I do strongly recommend this for any child and there family, I can't wait to watch it again, but I'm going to hold off on buying it.....The special features are suprisingly lacking, no behind the scenes, deleted scenes, bloopers, or anything, so I thinking the re-release will be packed, until next time, take care all.<br /><br />acting..........4 stars, Hanks is solid as usual<br /><br />directing........4.5 stars, Zemecki's vision is amazing<br /><br />special effects.....5 stars, CG at it's best, no equal.....yet<br /><br />kid, comedy rating....4 stars, Some goofy moments, but mostly a pretty serious movie with a strong message<br /><br />quality........4.5 stars, One of the better looking movies everth are amazing 4 star movies) and a little better then Ice Age or Monsters, Inc.

B000BM6AVA|5.0|I just bought this album today, with Mezmerize. I don't want to make a huge review, cause it's 1:07 am. It's a great cd, unique and different.
B000AP04FG|2.0|Except for a few cute moments here and there, this was a rather poorly done action flick. I went into this with high hopes, although not a huge Brad Pitt fan, I knew the man had delivered previously, and Angelina Jolie, even with her few flops, can be a good actress, and let's face it, this chick is smokin' hot!!! But as usual with myself getting \\"jiggy\\" for a movie, I was again let down, you'd think I'd be used to this by now. But, anyway, Let's begin with Mr. Pitt, shall we? Obviously one of Hollywood's golden boys, this man has made some huge hits, and this was one of them, and he is, um, OK in this, not great, but OK. I felt that during the comedic moments in this film he was really good, he can make you laugh pretty easily and has a gift for physical comedy, but when the serious, emotional scenes play out, I found him boring and lacking. Don't worry ladies, you get to see the world famous abs and pecs, I'm a strong enough man to be able to say this guy is hot and it'e easy to see why the ladies like him.<br /><br />Now for Angelina Jolie, wow does this woman look hot in a bra, which, among other lingerie items, she seems to be in alot of during this 123-minute movie. She too has a knack for some funny moments, and her chemistry with Pitt is decent, not memorable, but decent. Let's face it, Jolie has not done a decent acting job since Gia or Original Sin, and 'Smith\\" is no exception, she looks  sexy as hell, but that's about all I can give her, sorry.<br /><br />Now my biggest complaint, Vince Vaughn. One of the funniest men In Hollywood, with huge hits recently like Dodgeball and Wedding Crashers, you'd think he might have a chance in saving this. Nope, didn't happen, the man can't be funny and charming if he isn't given good material to work with, and except for one funny scene when he is yelling at his mother while carrying a rather big gun in his hands, the jokes here feel forced and really don't work.<br /><br />There are a couple of above-average action scenes, but way too many shoot-outs, most of them shot very choppy, scenes moving so quickly, I was wishing they would just slow down, you know, take your time in your killing, put on a show and all....<br /><br />I'm guessing alot of people are going to disagree with my review, In talking to some of my customers at work, alot of them were excited about this, raving on how the action really worked and Pitt and Jolie were excellent together, and that's fine. I guess I just want a little more with my action films these days, maybe a little more Sin City and Punisher and alot less Sahara and XXX2<br /><br />acting.........2.5 stars, Pitt and Jolie LOOK great, Vaughn bites<br /><br />directing.......2 stars, Poorly done, little more editing OK?<br /><br />special effects.....3 stars, Stunts are pretty cool, but gun play is well over-done<br /><br />action rating......2.5 stars, Some cool action...here and there<br /><br />quality........2.5 stars, Felt like an MTV video at times<br /><br />actionion scenes, but way too many shoot-outs, most of them shot very choppy, scenes moving so quickly, I was wishing they would just slow down, you know, take your time in your killing, put on a show and all.... <br /> <br />I'm guessing alot of people are going to disagree with my review, In talking to some of my customers at work, alot of them were excited about this, raving on how the action really worked and Pitt and Jolie were excellent together, and that's fine.

B00005JNZJ|3.0|As a fan of the series, I went into this movie rather cautiously.  After loving the weirdness and edginess of the animated version, would the film sit quite right? <br /> <br />Well . . . not entirely.  Some of the fundamental things about the TV series were lost, sadly.  Such as the general sense of weirdness.  It was nice to have a few recognizable things, such as Sathara, but Trevor was Trevor in name only, the entire relationship between him and Aeon, which the series hinged on, was changed utterly. <br /> <br />Having said that, from a purely entertainment point of view, it wasn't bad.  A summer popcorn flick, and a fair sci-fi story.  Somewhat predictable action, and very nice sets indeed.  If that's what you're looking for, it's not bad.  If you're looking for something edgy and different, try the series. <br />
B00005MM67|5.0|This is the best mountain climbing movie made! I like to watch it every 3-4 months, which is why I had to get the DVD (my video tape version was about worn out). There are probably better documentary style movies about mountaineering, but for a hollywood-style movie this is the best. The images of mountains and the feeling of high adventure are awesome! I'm surprised by the other negative reviews about this movie.<br /><br />I am a recreational mountaineer myself, and have read many mountaineering adventure books. I wish there were more mountaineering movies. Compared to \\"Vertical Limit\\", I thought \\"K2\\" was much more realistic.
B000BJS4SU|2.0|i didnt think this was very memorable. I only gave it 2 stars cause i think he really does like this music , and wants to play it,...i just think he doesnt realise he cant do it very well. I think John is deluding himself.
B00005JO17|4.0|Most of the computer-animated films since Toy Story have been funny enough for adults to enjoy as much as kids, and Chicken Little is no exception.  It's not one of the best, but I liked it better than Madagascar, earlier this year.  Compared to Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., Shrek, and Ice Age, this one was not quite as consistently funny, though very cute.  However, it added some sci-fi special effects particularly suited to CGI.  There's a piece of the sky - it really turns out to be a piece of something else - that projects an image from one side that's identical to what's behind it, making it effectively invisible, a gimmick I've read about a few years ago in a sci-fi story about nano-technology in Analog magazine.  The CGI effects make this sequence of Chicken Little one of the most amazing of any movie out this year.  Just for laughs, however, Wallace and Grommit and the Curse of the Wear Rabbit, which used traditional stop-motion animation, was a bit funnier.
0316779237|3.0|David Sedaris, playwright and commentator for National Public Radio, gives us six seasonal tales in this slim volume of his short stories.<br /><br />\\"SantaLand Diaries,\\" the recounting of his days working as an elf at Macy's, is far and away the gem of the collection.  Sedaris is hilariously funny as he hits on the universal truths and human patterns of behavior that make Christmas the beloved, harried season that it is.<br /><br />The second story \\"Season's Greetings to Our Friends and Family!\\" begins in an equally funny vein posing as the Christmas letter from hell.  What cheery news does the family who has seen a member murdered and another arrested for the crime write?  Again, hilariously funny, but a rather dark turn at the end left an unseasonably bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />\\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" continues this walk on the dark side as a young boy follows his sister to her secret life and they bring home a prostitute for Christmas.  He gets a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing they have something no other family does.<br /><br />\\"Front Row Center with Thaddeus Bristol\\" returns to a lighter version of Christmas as Sedaris takes the reader to a variety of elementary school Christmas plays.  Mini actors that only a devoted camcorder-toting parent could love have us laughing even when we know we shouldn't.  Anyone who has ever sat through one of these amateur productions will relate to his wry insights.<br /><br />\\"Based upon a True Story\\" is the most cynical of the selections and hits at the materialistic baseness that lurks in everyone.<br /><br />\\"Christmas Means Giving\\" takes the idea of outdoing your fellow man to the most bizarre of all limits and again, may not be the cheery Christmas feel-good story one is looking for.
B0000942LT|5.0|As a lot of their nu-metal counterparts were fading away in 2003 (see Limp Bizkit), Staind stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with the follow up to their extremely popular CD \\"Break the Cycle.\\" \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" proved to be another commercial success for the quartet who hail from Massachusetts. <br /> <br />After the popularity of the successful power ballads, \\"Outside,\\" \\"It's Been Awhile,\\" and \\"Epiphany\\" from their previous release, Staind's first single off their 2003 album was a more heavier song entitled, \\"Price to Play.\\" That garnered success on the rock charts, but failed to make an impact on top 40 radio, like \\"It's Been Awhile\\" and \\"Outside\\" did. <br /> <br />But one listen through the album, and you knew their were a few power ballads sitting their, just waiting to be introduced to the maintstream. Track 3, \\"So Far Away\\" was one of them. Following in the footsteps of \\"It's Been Awhile,\\" the second single off this CD reached #1 on the rock and top 40 charts and kept Staind in the spotlight. The third single, \\"How About You\\" was very successful for the band as well. <br /> <br />With the addition of a new daughter (and I would assume the success of \\"Break the Cycle\\"), \\"14 Shades of Grey\\" has a more happier tone to it than the darker tones of the previous albums. \\"Zoe Jane\\" is a song written by Lewis to his daughter and \\"Intro\\" is a thank you message to all the people close to him. \\"Blow Away\\" is another excellent track that ranks toward the top of my all-time favorite Staind songs. <br /> <br />With label support and another world tour following the release of this CD, Staind proved to be a mainstay in the rock scene for at least a few more years--and made this fan look forward to another new Staind album in 2005.
B000BGH22W|5.0|I am a huge Danny Elfman fan,  But when I heard the score for HPGOF, I found some more composers, like Patrick Doyle, to add to my list of favorites.  Simply said, this score is breath-taking.  The melody that makes this a must buy for me is \\"Harry in Winter.\\"  While it is different than the first three, Goblet's score is fantastic.
B000BOH8XW|4.0|Shakira has had a big year this year.  It is amazing that her lead single from her first release of 2005, the Spanish-language album FIJACION ORAL, VOL. 1, \\"La Tortura\\" did so amazing on the pop radio.  Furthermore, the album didn't do bad itself scoring a large scan for a Latin album.  Now, Shakira returns with her English Language ORAL FIXATION, VOL. 2, which is of course the second album of the double album.<br /><br />Shakira remarkably on ORAL FIXATION, VOL. 2 sounds very similar to Canadian Alt-Pop singer Alanis Morissette.  At times, you could even mistake Shakira to be Alanis because like Alanis, Shakira has the unique bends and inflections within her vocals.  It is definitely a unique voice that sits very well in the production for the most part, but, at times Shakira slightly overdoes the inflections and they grow grating. Again, for the most part, Shakira's unmistakable vocals are right on and are as sensual and sexy as \\"La Totura\\" was on FIJACION ORAL, VOL. 1.<br /><br />There is very little filler material on this album, which for the most part leave genuine hits.  The production throughout this album is especially well done as Shakira incredibly crosses over between latin and U.S.A. pop on such songs as the concluding \\"Timor\\" and the trumpet-influenced tracks of \\"Animal City\\" and \\"Hey You\\".  At other times, Shakira sounds more pop-ish with tracks like the incredible \\"Dreams For Plans\\", \\"Your Embrace\\", or great first single \\"Don't Bother\\".  Unfortunately, this songs may not end up being as popular as her sexy Latin hit \\"La Tortura\\" was, but they all make for a very nice rounded pop album.  There are no real complaints here; the material for the most part is inspired, though it might take a few listens to get the full inspiration of some of the songs.  3.5 to 4 stars.
B000001FA4|2.0|On the whole, I find this album rather disappointing.  8 out of the 10 songs of the album are not appealing at all.  It may be that the album is too focused on America, if we consider the wording of the song titles: \\"Elvis Presley and America\\", \\"4th of July\\".  Having listened to 7out of 10 albums (not counting the 2 `Best Of'), I still see War as the best U2 album, in spite of it being so noisy. <br />But from this rather mediocre record, two songs stand out.  Though I still have difficulty to fathom what this song is about, The Unforgettable Fire is a catchy track.  But then there is Pride (In the name of love), one of the band's best ever songs, to be put into the same category as New Year's Day (1983) or One (1991).  Pride is a touching tribute to one of the greatest ever Human Rights' fighters, Martin Luther King.  Maybe a little bit of history might help to understand the song better.  Luther King was a pastor in the state of Alabama.  He fought actively for the rights of the oppressed Afro-American community, and in spite of being faced with constant injustice, maintained an approach of peace and non-violence in his efforts to fight racial discrimination.  On April 4th, 1968 he was killed in Memphis by a sniper.  The last part of the song clearly refers to this event: <br />  <br />\\"Early morning, April 4th <br />  Shut rings out, in the Memphis sky\\" <br /> <br />Then, Bono and his band also show a great knowledge of certain little details that make the song more credible as a tribute.  On the tombstone of King was carved the following inscription: \\"Free at last. Free at last. Thank God almighty I'm free at last.\\"  This quote from a religious folk song was often used by King in his speeches.  In turn, Bono and his acolytes make use of these lines:  <br />\\"Free at last, <br />They took your lives <br />They could not take your pride.\\" <br /> <br />U2 have always supported noble causes: fighting against poverty; fair trade; fight against apartheid; human rights.Here, they also pay a tribute to a great person.  Pride is not only a wonderful song but also a fitting homage.  May Martin Luther King rest in peace, and let us hope that his fight will never be forgotten... <br /> <br />P.S: Another song on the album \\"MLK\\", pays tribute to Luther King.
B000BPCCZA|5.0|You people should stop your complaining immediatly! I bought the dualdisc today and I was not let doen one bit. The CD is great, the DVD side is awesome and that's it.<br /><br />Mainly, the best part is the CD!!!!! Here, we have 12 amazing tracks by an amazing band called System Of A Down. It has many great tracks such as Hypnotize, She's Like Heroin, and Vicinity Of Obscenity.<br /><br />The DVD is cool, with a so-so documentary and 2 music videos hard to find on TV.<br /><br />It is worth all the money.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|I am a big mariah fan, and i have purchased everything that she has ever released. I think that Mimi is an amazing album, and I have purchased all editions of this album. However, I just can't believe that I will have to cough up for another edition at the end of december!!! <br /> <br />I do love mariah, but this just reeks of greed. 5 editions of one album, in one year, is completely unacceptable. Mariah, please come to your senses!!!!
B000BP86OG|4.0|The Darkness is a breath of fresh air amidst a legion of depressing sounding bands from the nineties. They also fill a great void left after the disappearance of one of the greatest bands on Earth-Queen. They prove that rock music can still be fun and joy. One Way ticket to Hell is a very nice album despite the legth of 35 minutes and could be great if all of the songs were good. But they aren't. The title track is very good but not excellent. Girlfriend is simply awful. It sounds worse than a bad Bee Gees song. Is it just me is an average song, not bad, with some  la AC/DC riffs. The good thing is that the rest of the album is awesome. Bald is the heaviest song on the album and one of the best. Hazel Eyes is fantastic, as well as Knockers and Blind Man ( a heartbraking ballad, I am sure the guys from Queen will like it). English Country Garden is also a great song, again  la Queen. I think the album is a step further musically and vocally. The Darkness are still searching for their sound and have tried new things and most of them are great. I think they have to stick to the heavier material and the ballads. That's what they do best. And get rid of the cheesy poppy stuff.
B000002J0B|5.0|Has any great band ever been able to create an equal follow up to their one true masterpiece? You can't help but wonder if that was going through the heads of Plant, Page, Bonham and Jones when writing this album.  Pink Floyd almost did it with \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" Black Sabbath nearly did it with \\"Master of Reality.\\" Right around the same time Led Zeppelin had this daunting task after the massive success of their forth \\"Zoso\\" album.  Did they do it?  I guess it depends who you ask, I think their fifth release \\"House of the Holy\\" is Zeppelin's best album.  It is not an easy task to pick a favorite Zeppelin album but for some reason this one appeals to me the most.  Many will argue that their will never be a finer album from Zeppelin, or for that matter any band, than Led Zeppelin IV.  True Zeppelin IV is their most comercialy popular, and some of their most original and influential ideas about what a song could be came from that album, but in my opinion Houses of the Holy takes that idea to the next level.  Zeppelin matured on this release, this is the start of what the record companies would dub, \\"the latter days.\\"  You can hear a gentle maturity on songs like  \\"Over the hills and far away\\" \\"The Rain Song\\" and \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\" On songs like \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Dancing Days,\\" they stick too their blues based hard rockin roots.  They even experiment on the popular classics \\"Dyer Maker\\" and my favorite \\"No Quarter.\\"              This album has something for everyone, it's just song after song of great music.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|Enya is a complicated artist, and the complexity really shows on this release. It seems Enya has matured somewhat since \\"A Day Without Rain\\".  The vocals here are stronger, she is trying new things vocally, and the musical compositions (in terms of instrumentation selection) have gotten simpler.<br /><br />There's a really strong anthem, \\"Long long journey\\", and two really strong vocal pieces, \\"If I could be where you are\\" and \\"Someone said goodbye\\", that showcase the voice instead of the instrumentation.  \\"Amarantine\\" (the song) is catchy, with simple lyrics to which you can easily sing along.  \\"Sumiregusa\\" is a mysterious piece (sung in Japanese) that gets more and more interesting every time you listen to it.<br /><br />In fact, this can be said of the entire album.  The more you listen to these songs, the more you appreciate the beauty of what is going on. This isn't simple pop, and therefore won't be easily accepted and digested by the masses.<br /><br />Of particular interest are the songs sung in a \\"new\\" language called Loxian.  Although some will debate the legitimacy of \\"inventing a new language\\", the language used here is well-suited to the chanting of Enya, with excellent vowel sounds and soft consonants.  It works really well with Enya's voice.<br /><br />The overall design of the music is simpler...perhaps because Enya intends on (finally) taking her music on the road...?
B000002UJQ|5.0|This third opus from Radiohead is by far the best album in history.  Better than the Beatles, Elvis, etc.  The various paths of music that the band takes you on each track is infinite.  Infinite because everytime you listen to it, it is fresh, new, unique.  Yes, even though you just listened to it an hour ago.  Radiohead is the only artist this applies to (for me, anyway).   <br /> <br />It saddens me on negative reviews - but every one is entitled to an opinion.  There are people out there who think Slim Whitman or the silky sounds of Tiny Tim are better than sliced bread.  One man's trash is another's treasure.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder - or whatever.  What it comes down to, though - there are those who turn on the light in a dark room and those who choose to remain in darkness.  I'm glad I turned on the light.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is one of the most innovative atmospheric bands on the market. Their transition from above average rock band with Pablo Honey to their later albums, especially OK Computer, displays their versatility. They are amazing.
B000002JSJ|1.0|I think by the time this album was released Led Zeppelin were past their peak (ZOSO). There is nothing here that makes you stand up and take notice.<br /><br />Mediocre, unexcitable.
B000BC8TBE|1.0|This album is as flat as they come, and the dual disc re-release is as cheap and lame as they get! Don't waste your hard-earned cash on such a lame sounding album, from an artist who seems to love 're-releasing' every mediocre album she 'creates'. Her greed is disgraceful, and her fans are blind (and deaf)!! <br /> <br />At least she is skinny on this album cover, unlike her recent bulging pattern.
630471193X|2.0|Motion picture messages are so smoothly constructed and mass produced today, audiences would hardly bat and eye if they were seeing anti-intellectualism presented to them in a form that also imputes witchcraft, telekinesis for example.  Big ideas must mean something from outer space has infected the brain; or anything intelligent, resourceful or efficient.  Also foreign language acquisition is held suspect by this piece of government propaganda, we're better off being mono-lingual and ignorant of others around the world.  While not as mudslinging and rife with judicial malpractice as the Salem Witchcraft Trials, movies still libel segments of the population the state has deemed unwanted or suspect for reasons of their beliefs, attitudes and intellectual pursuits.  Then the mudsling is that intelligence must be unnatural and under alien control, that it means something is organically wrong with the brain; of late it has been more popular for the exercise of state oppression to simply label people as mentally ill (without all the cosmic conspiracy angle).  What it really means is that the tireless efforts the government has put in place to destroy the public education system, and to weaponize the culinary water supplies everywhere with a vectored chemical incapacitant wmd, fluoridation, must now jealously and suspiciously interdict any signs of its ineffectiveness at rendering the population functionally illiterate, subaverage in memory, language, logic and mathematics skills.<br /><br />There is no big important secret cipher system at risk, that the government needs to keep a secret in order to subjugate unwanted populations of chemically inundated citizens; it is plain to see and requires no algorithm to decode.  The pattern is obvious:  exploit, lie, poison and insult the residual intelligence of the population they haven't yet completely wiped out.  This movie is a highly revealing sick statement of an insular, autocratic technological empire crumbling under its own inconsistencies and open acts of war, mob violence and vigilantism on America; a foreign policy of isolationism attempting to disguise corporate colonialism as our outreach, when the overstatements of xenophobia for international languages couldn't be more apparent or reflection of the decline in the U.S. education system.  Demonization of intellectuals is old fascist whining and scare tactic.  It is making more movies than sense because its only card to play is hypnosis in order to evade fairly simple identification of its ideology and modus operandi.<br /><br />Other than the large dimensions of psychological film project objectives for mass populations the psycorps or planning and budgeting of the Pentagon designs, this film also has latent suggestible side effects that could be harmful to young people prior to the age of disillusionment with the establishment.  The film could instill phobias in young people that academic achievement or the strengthening of their intellect is somehow a demonic or alien compromise, that smart is bad and that dumb is preferred.  Use this film if anything to make a fool of the corruption that thinks we take it seriously.  Who is the more alien-invasion insidiousness anyway?<br /><br />There are these people out there who think they have big ideas, something to contribute.  They believe in direct democracy, energy conservation, environmentalism, alternative forms of power extraction and won't learn from the coy ridicules of cinematic revisionism not to see others equally, or not bother to learn to speak some of their language.  What's to be done with them?  Perhaps they'll die naturally from the progression of their disease, as they so should.  It seems that would be in keeping with this film's sick prescription.<br /><br /> Oh, and in case you're writing in the newspaper oped style that can't make an argument without  telling people what to think verbatim, remember to begin with the polemic:  \\"That's what's going on here!...\\"s own inconsistencies and open acts of war, mob violence and vigilantism on America; a foreign policy of isolationism attempting to disguise corporate colonialism as our outreach, when the overstatements of xenophobia for international languages couldn't be more apparent or reflection of the decline in the U.S. education system.

B000BO0LLS|1.0|After purchasing this release, and listening to it, i could not believe I had fallen for the same old industry trap, the 'let's re-release this mediocre album in increase sales' trick. Never has a release been so mechanical and obvious in it's attempt to increase sales for an artist. Mariah is more sickening than usher, in that she tries to pull it off whilst pretending to be genuine. The new single 'Don't forget about us' is as contrived as a song can be, and is a calculated radio hit, with no substance or emotion apparent. <br /> <br />Stay right away from this release!!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't know what to say exactly...but this album rocks. No, this album isn't the best album ever. But I must agree that it is somewhere near the top.  <br />Stand out songs: Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, Karma Police and No Surprises.  <br /> <br />Definitely worth buying.
B000B8QEZG|5.0|This album will blow you away, in it's writing, production and pure infectious brilliance. Never has an album infected my brain with such audio bliss, and caused my body to sway in such abandon. Anyone with a liking for music which is multi-layered in it's brilliance, and textured in it's mood and atmosphere, needs to pick this album up.
B000AP04FG|4.0|\\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is part shoot'em up action flick, part romantic comedy that succeeds on the charisma of its stars and on its humor. John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith met in Columbia five or six years previously and married after a whirlwind romance. Unbeknownst to each other, John and Jane are both professional assassins working for competing agencies. They lie to each other about their jobs, hide their unusual talents, and live a sedate suburban life. So sedate, in fact, that their marriage has gotten stale. That all changes when they are both assigned the same target. Now they're gunning for each other -which sure does spice up their marriage.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" doesn't make much sense. It's never clear why John and Jane want to kill each other or if they really do. But they make quite a show of it. I couldn't figure out if they worked for private or government agencies, which are equally unlikely given the sort of action in this film. Jane's injuries disappear between scenes. The high-tech gadgets are more comical than cool. But neither action films nor comedies stake their success on realism. \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" realizes that, and director Doug Liman takes everything over the top. Even so, the action and cute banter would wear thin if the film didn't have 3 cycles in which John and Jane's situation changes. That shakes things up a bit and keeps the audience interested. There is a whole lot of violence in this movie purely for entertainment purposes. And it's not graphic; it's fun -which some people won't like. But \\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\\" is energetic fluff with 2 appealing stars bickering and shooting and generally looking like movie stars.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): Bonus features include one featurette, 3 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, a teaser, a soundtrack promotional spot, and 3 audio commentaries. \\"Making a Scene Featurette\\" (8 minutes) is a short documentary from Fox Movie Channel about creating the action scene in which John and Jane first confront each other as Jane speeds away in her car. The thought of listening to 3 audio commentaries was so daunting that I didn't listen to any, so I will just say: The first commentary is by director Doug Liman and screenwriter Simon Kinberg. The second commentary is by producers Akiva Goldman and Lucas Foster. The third commentary is by editor Michael Tronick, production designer Jeff Mann, and visual effects supervisor Kevin Elam. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.action scene in which John and Jane first confront each other as Jane speeds away in her car.

B00005OAIE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD!  It's one that I have to play for about 4 or 5 weeks constantly before I get sick of it.  Then it'll go back on the shelf for a week or two until I start all over again.<br /><br />It's a great CD to relax to - putting yourself to sleep (in a good way), working on homework, background music, anything.<br /><br />No Such Thing - 5/5 One of the best songs on the CD.  The lyrics are great and the tune is really catchy.  I ususally hate the first song on a CD after listening to it for a while, but this is the first CD I can't wait for the first song to come around again!<br /><br />Why Georgia - 4/5 Another good song, although not as good as the first track.  Another lazy, summer-afternoon song.  Nice guitar and vocals as usual.  Lyrics are sweet, nothing that spectacular.<br /><br />My Stupid Mouth - 4/5 Same guitar and vocal style.  A good track, but nothing to really make it stand out.  A song only appreciated after hearing it a few times.  Nice chorus.<br /><br />Your Body is a Wonderland - 4/5 A bit of a different feel to it.  Creative and sweet lyrics.  So personal, it seems he's singing to someone in particular.<br /><br />Neon - 5/5 Another of the better songs.  Kind of a NY-jazz atmosphere to it, which suits the lyrics.  Great chorus which gets stuck in your head easily.  For once it's a good thing.<br /><br />City Love - 3.5/5 My least favorite on the CD, mainly due to the first line \\"I never liked this apple much\\"...just seems an odd way to begin.  Guitar and tune much like the others.<br /><br />83 - 4/5 Nice, simple song.  Clever lyrics in parts, but nothing that spectacular.<br /><br />3x5 - 4.5/5 Another really good song - catchy tune, great lyrics.  A little bit more rhythm to it.<br /><br />Love Song For No One - 5/5 Excellent song, nothing else to say about it!<br /><br />Back To You - 4/5 Nice guitar, nice lyrics.  Good song in general, but definitely background music.<br /><br />Great Indoors - 4/5  Interesting lyrics.  Really nice laid-back song.<br /><br />Not Myself - 4/5 Stands out on the track because it slows down a bit and the guitar is a bit stronger.  Good lyrics.<br /><br />There is no track 13 for some random reason...perhaps he's superstitious?<br /><br />St. Patrick's Day - 3.5/5 Nice song, but gets too long.Interesting lyrics.  Really nice laid-back song. <br /> <br />Not Myself - 4/5 Stands out on the track because it slows down a bit and the guitar is a bit stronger.  Good lyrics. <br /> <br />There is no track 13 for some random reason...perhaps he's superstitious? <br /> <br />St. Patrick's Day - 3.5/5 Nice song, but gets too long.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Whenever I get asked my fav movies the Karate Kid is up there in my top 3 along side The Breakfast Club and Ferris Buellers day off. Yes they r all 80's movies, well I am an 80's child:) and proud of it:) we 80's children grew up in an idealistic era full of cheesy sitcoms and bubble gum pop, and some of the best cheesy yet genuis movies ever made, every time the theme music starts on the Karate Kid I am instantly taken for just that split second back to my childhood where I am free to dream and be inspired. I know Ralph Macchio hasn't always had the movie acclaim and longevity he so rightly deserved, but he will always hold a special place in all of our 80's children hearts as the Karate Kid, and hey to inspire a whole generation with one movie is pretty cool if u ask me:) Long Live the Karate Kid:)
B00005NWM3|2.0|Yes, that's what I said, okay at best. That's because the best song on the album happens to be How You Remind Me, and it's just okay. There's nothing else on this record that's really worth anything, except for possibly Never Again and Good Times Gone. The tunes all seem the same after a couple tracks and the lyrics aren't particularly interesting either. Nickelback's theme seems to be of hardship and sorrow, and that's fine with me, but they could at least try to put a little more variety into their music. They have some potential, of course. Frontman Chad Kroeger has a great voice, and it is decent rock, but if you just download the three songs I mentioned then you \\"miss out\\" on seven other tracks that sort of blend together and have no meaning. That's a good thing.

AB showed the strong potential of Sigur Ros...displaying all their different ideas and sounds in thier music. I could easily see each song from AB made into an entire album.

0141439513|5.0|I must admit Pride and Prejudice is one of those many books I \\"spark noted\\" in high school rather than reading. It wasn't that I wasn't an avid reader, just at the time I more enjoyed silly sci fi books. Looking back I'm very happy that it isn't until now that I've read this book, because now I think I am more able to fully appreciate it. The characters are very well developed. Be them witty, silly, meddling, proud or prejudicial, they are all a pleasure to get to know and explore. The story as a whole, and the way it is presented to the reader is wonderfull. This is, to date, one of the best books I've ever had the pleasure of reading. (And any one who disagrees should be immediatley taken out back and shot, or at the very least pitied for their simple-mindedness.)

0679422714|5.0|Couldn't put it down. <br /> <br />The complaint of the Mao apologists who have written some of the negative reviews here is that the book's tone is too strident and not \\"objective\\" enough. But how is it possible to discuss men like Mao, Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, and others and make it sound like you're discussing recipes for roast duck? When you read some of the negative reviews it becomes patently clear that they are very far from being objective themselves. They're either too lazy, or unwilling, to check out some of the many sources the book uses, many of which are in print and available, so they do a Chomsky number: nit-pick when you can't disprove. <br /> <br />Also, no one should be surprised to learn in this book that several of the Nationalist generals were really Communist moles, deliberately losing battles. Just look at World War II, the FDR administration, and elsewhere (and check out the Venona Papers, which can be found on-line) and you'll realize that the only thing the Communists ever excelled at was espionage. How can you not have a good spy network when every third or fourth writer and professor in the whole world sympathizes with your ideology? That's how it was in those days, anyway. <br />

B00006ADFL|5.0|Forget Lord of the Rings, Heavenly Creatures is Peter Jackson's masterpiece.  The film that took him out of horror film obscurity and which launched Kate Winslets film career, Heavenly Creatures shows what a man with a special effects background like Jackosn can do with \\"straight\\" drama.   <br /> <br />Plot wise the story revolves around the true story of two New Zealand girls in the 1950s who become friends and, according to the film, lovers.  They share a rich fantasy world which Jackson does a great job of bringing to life (there are some great scenes with claymation fantasy figures).  As their relationship deepens their relationship with their increasingly concerned parents deteriorates.  When they are learn that they are to be seperated they decide to murder one of their mothers.   <br /> <br />None of this is really a spoiler since Jackson starts out the film with a statement of their crime and with the girls running bloody from the scene.  There is a lot of interesting narrative techniques as the film moves between fantasy and reality, and back and then forward in time.  The story of the girls friendship moves forward with all the tension and urgency of a train jumping the tracks.  A great film by a great film maker.
B000003TA9|5.0|this is my favorite sonic youth album.'91-'92 were great years for me in music,in that so many great albums came out during this period,most of which i have or will rate eventually.\\"100%\\",\\"swimsuit issue\\",\\"drunken butterfly\\",\\"shoot\\",\\"sugar kane\\",\\"nic fit\\",and \\"on the strip\\" are my personal favs.if you like noise done right and haven't checked out this band yet than i would start here.if you like this than you are bound to like others like \\"goo\\" and \\"daydream nation\\".many have taken gordon and moores cues and used them as if they were their own.never forget where it came from.

B000002UUH|5.0|The most important is the essential is here. OK, they released this new compilation this year, WORKING-CLASS HERO, but it's a double CD and I'm not sure John Lennon wrote so many essential songs during his post-Beatles career.<br /><br />Here you have all the 70's hits plus the DOUBLE FANTASY album tracks. That's enough like that. I really like John's work in the seventies but this CD captures the most important songs: IMAGINE, INSTANT KARMA, GIVE PEACE A CHANCE, COLD TURKEY and even the rare track MOVE OVER MRS L. about his breakup with Yoko in the mid-70's.<br /><br />So save your money, buy this one, enjoy the music and if you love it then you know you can purchase the original albums.<br /><br />Remember this is the album that was released to commemorate the second anniversary of John's death in 1982. That was John's first true greatest hits package and it went triple platinum in the US alone since then.
B000002LRX|5.0|yet another great birthed in '92.i believe it was the same year that i saw them open up for guns n' roses and metallica at the orange bowl,one of my all-time favorite shows.my first experience with faith was with their debut album \\"introduce yourself\\".man is this a change for the better.after \\"introduce\\" they replaced their singer with mike patton and thank god for it.patton has to be, no scratch that,IS one of the best vocalists in this type of music.his range is larger than his vocal cords.plus he has one of the best screams i've ever heard.of course patton would go on to the other great bands,mr. bungle,fantomas and lovage,all extremely worth checking out.faith no more is one of those great bands that will never go out of style and should be remembered more for than just \\"epic\\".if you are a fan of \\"epic\\" and don't have this than i strongly urge you to get it as it is their best work.
B000AYQLX6|3.0|First of all, it's true, it's not Lennon's Best album. But it's a great pleasure to hear this album in a remastered edition.<br /><br />Many tracks sound like fillers and the album lacks a sense of coherence. Anyway, NOBODY KNOWS YOU (WHEN YOU're DOWN AND OUT), WHAT YOU GOT, WHATEVER GETS YOU, STEEL AND GLASS are truly great tracks by Lennon. He hadn't lost his touch although he was heavily drinking at the time. The only thing he should have done for this album is to get an outside producer. His ex-partner, Paul McCartney, had been successful at producing his 1974 N°1 album BAND ON THE RUN, but Lennon wasn't a great producer.<br /><br />Had he left the producer seat to someone else, I'm sure WALLS AND BRIDGES could have been his best album after IMAGINE.<br /><br />The interview in the bonus tracks is in fact a message by Lennon to the people in EMI Records who were supposed to sell the album. You can hear in John's message his doubts about the commerciability of his album. He keeps telling them it's a great album so it will be easy to sell it but when you know John's history, you know that at that time he wasn't sure he could ever be N°1 again. He made a bet with Elton John and lost it when he got N°1 both with his album and his single (WHATEVER GETS YOU...). But he would never be N°1 again until December 1980.
B000002IQW|4.0|what makes this especially good is that they had the balls enough in managing to alienate all the teeny boppers who made them famous in the first place with their first album. \\"slave to the grind\\" is much rawer and heavier and god bless them for it.sebastian bach is one of the great vocalists,right up there with rob halford,and that is the biggest compliment that i could possibly give a vocalist.oh and damn van halen for not picking this guy up when they had a chance.i thought that would have been MUCH better than gary cherone,but het,that's just me i guess.anyway,the only reason why i don't give this a perfect score is because the lyrics sometimes become a little too harsh against women for my tastes and some of the songs like,\\"in a darkened room\\" aren't as memorable as others.but the way the album explodes at the start and how it continues is great.bach's scream at the beginning of \\"monkey business\\" still gets me,\\"slave to the grind\\" kicks hard as a great metal sound.bach shines the most on the last song though,\\"wasted time\\",his beautiful vocals punctuating the lyrics.hats off to these guys for standing up for their beliefs and doing what they want to and not what was expected of them.one of the best hard rock/metal albums of the '90's.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|December 27th will see a Diamond Edition of this album released, which will encompass an updated bonus DVD, and an extra third disc which will feature an array of remixes. What's more, is that it will come in a collector's box, and will include a full lengh poster of the album cover. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, this sounds like a good version to grab, had it been relesed 2 weeks ago!!!!! However, since I have already parted with my cash for 2 versions of this album, I am absolutely mad that mariah would authorise such a blatent attempt to cash in on her success.  <br /> <br />Please mariah, stop forcing your fans to cough up their money everytime your label decides to add a video or remix to an already stale release. Stop the madness!!! <br /> <br />What's worse, it will be selling at 24.99 (approximately, though not certain). This is an extremely high price, and for that, I will be passing!!
B000022TSW|5.0|ha ha.what a great movie.it's still funny after all these years.i still tear up with laughter and i challenge anyone not to laugh as well.the songs are great,\\"m'kay\\" has gotta be my favorite.one of the all-time greatest oscar moments has to be when robin williams sang,\\"blame canada\\",for trey parker and matt stones oscar nominated song! they didn't win of course but still.who would ever have thought that an animated movie would be this filthy and disgusting.thank god for it though as all the jokes work and work well.with each view i see something that i missed and develop yet another new laugh.for another great parker and stone movie i highly recommend \\"team america:world police.\\" everyone should own \\"bigger,longer & uncut\\" because we all need alot of laughs in this life.this movie makes me look at myself and say,\\"i'm taking life way too seriously and i need to lighten the hell up!\\" well a comedy such as this sure does do the trick.until i watch the news that is.but a comedy such as this should be a \\"safe place\\" for us all because we all need to lighten the hell up!
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The first two discs of this new edition show the film itself so that the best sound and resolution are possible; indeed, the presentation is likely to be definitive, at least until another edition is issued next year. For those inclined to watch this three-hour movie four more times, there are four commentary tracks by filmmakers discussing their input. A fifth commentary and other features on a third disc leave no aspect of this film unremarked. Clarity of sound and picture, together with the extras explaining how it was made, makes this \\"Titanic\\" the one to own. So throw away your other two editions if you can't wait for the fourth transfer next year.    James Cameron has spared nothing to bring us his take on history's greatest maritime tragedy. What happened that night is full of incidents of heroism, sacrifice, cowardice and hubris, all true, involving legendary New York financial and society figures, on the grandest of scales. A black-and-white feature film of a BBC television account, based on Walter Lord's book, movingly tapped that potential in \\"A Night to Remember.\\" Cameron's big-budget version using modern movie magic, even a replica of the giant ship itself, was highly anticipated, hugely lucrative and received numerous awards.    Alas, the true drama of this disaster, and the people it tested, are ignored by Cameron, who wrote, produced and directed. \\"Titanic\\" focuses on a romance between an uppity poor boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) and unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet), her snobbish mother, and the society cad (Billy Zane) she wants for her daughter. This tired cliche, told in flashback, dawdles for two hours until the vessel scrapes an iceberg because its lookouts were watching the young couple neck. While fate transfixes the ship and its doomed passengers, we must watch the cad chase the lovers, shooting at them as the waters rise.     Still, there is likeable work from DiCaprio and Winslet (she got the Oscar nod he should have had.) Kathy Bates is a natural \\"unsinkable\\" Molly Brown and Victor Garber is touchingly bewildered as the ship architect. Sinking the unsinkable is partly CGI rendered in harrowing detail. Insights into real and compelling incident and character disappear behind a trite love story, trivializing the 1,500 souls who drowned. Our heroine (nicely played in the present by Oscar nominee Gloria Stuart) has grown old clutching a diamond pendant. Why she drops it in the deep only Davy Jones knows.
B000069D4M|5.0|Every year for the past five years when the holidays seasons comes around and Christmas comes near, I log on to Amazon to see if this movie version of the Nutcracker Sweet has finally been released on DVD, and every year I'm disappointed to see it not there. This year, to my pleasant surprise, they have this listing up with the promise of a potential \\"maybe soon\\".<br /><br />By far this is my favorite rendering of the Nutcracker, mostly because it is the most true to the original classic. While still beautiful and elegant, this one has slightly darker undertones, which gives it less of a kiddy feel. Beyond that by staying closer to the original the entire second half actually has context and meaning, instead of it being ballet for the sake of ballet. Add in the majestic pieces, superbly choreographed dance, and expertly crafted costuming and sets, and this movie comes alive like not of the other Nutcrackers have before.<br /><br />I can't recommend this version highly enough. And if it ever comes to DVD it will be a very merry Christmas indeed.
0679422714|5.0|This fine book's main achievement was to make the case against this tyrant air-tight. I've read in other books about China that the Reds had a standing rule: one-third of our military efforts are to be against the Japanese, and two-thirds against the Nationalists. These authors didn't say much about the famine that wasn't already said by Jasper Becker in his book on the subject, Hungry Ghosts, which estimates a death toll of at least 30 million (page 339). Dick Wilson, in his book China: The Big Tiger (U.K.: Abacus, 1996), puts the death toll of Mao's Great Leap Forward at 40 million (page 27). John Fraser, in his book The Chinese: Portrait of a People (U.K.: Fontana/Collins, 1980), wrote that \\"This practice [making people wear drab, uniform-like clothing] was rife during the Cultural Revolution when a cult of poverty was actually foisted on a people who had known little but poverty--an amazing feat when you consider that Communism's big promise is material achievement.\\" (Page 344.) This is the only subject I'd like to have seen more of in Mao: The Unknown Story--how Mao's self-hatred about being the son of a rich peasant was transformed into an ideology of self-hatred and self-punishment. There's a good book that Amazon sells (Guilt, Blame, and Politics) that analyzes this phenomenon.
0553583182|1.0|Such a waste of my money and my time!  I really perplexes me that this book got 114 reveiws before mine and actually had an average of 4 1/2 stars!!!!!  That is just insane!!!!  I've read Tony Robbins Unlimited Power, The Giant within, and all the other new age spiritual psychology books such as Dr. Wayne Dyer's books......Every single one of them are so much more informative and so much more packed with practical suggestions \\"How\\" you can use affirmations to change your life, not just keep talking your subconcious mind can change your life.  Also the style of writing is SO boring to read!!!  Maybe because this book is actually written or first published in 1963?  No wonder all the thoughts and information is so old!!!   <br /> <br />I would've given it a 0 star if there is!
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|A comedy and sports movie in one. Great fun. The ending was obvious but was worth watching.
B00092ZMDY|1.0|I'm not throwing any rocks and stones at the band.  Their performance is top notch and the song selection is a true representation of their best. Perhaps Witchy Woman should have formed part of the set but only they know why it was not included.<br /><br />My main gripe about this purchase is that we are not offered a Dolby 5.1 surround sound track. The fine folks at Warner Music Vision & ERC have decided that if you do not possess a DTS system, you will be punished by being forced to listen to the DVD in 'glorious' PCM (2-channel speaker) stereo.<br /><br />Is there a legit reason why there is no Dolby 5.1 surround sound track?<br /><br />This is a true sign of disrespect towards not only the fans of The Eagles but to all consumers.<br /><br />Review by Brian Grindrod
B000BGH22W|3.0|Patrick Doyle didn't do a bad job - I rate this better than the Chamber of Secrets soundtrack. However, Prisoner of Azkaban is still my favourite Harry Potter soundtrack followed by the Philosopher's Stone.
0553801503|4.0|A Feast for Crows George R. R. Martin's 4th installment of A Song of Fire and Ice picks up where A Storm of Swords left off. Well sort of. If you haven't read the previous 3 then don't start here. Go back and Pick Up A Game of Thrones.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />  Everything is good. Even when Martin is writing a section where not much is going on his characters have such depth that it is still completely interesting, which is one of the great things about martin's writing, the characters. They grow, they evolve, your sure you hate one of them then you find yourself liking them. The stories seem to be driven as much by the characters as by what is going on in the story.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br /> No Tyrion, No Jon Snow, No Daenerys, I repeat,  No Tyrion, No Jon Snow, No Daenerys. For those of you who don't already know the book A Feast for Crows grew too large for one volume so instead of cutting the book in half, half of the characters story were put in A Feast and the other half will be put in the next book a Dance with Dragons. This doesn't ruin the book but you will find yourself looking for your favorite missing characters and this is why this book is a 4 instead of a 5. The story, although great, Does not move forward substantially. This doesn't mean the story wasn't good but it hasn't made a leap forward. I am fearful that Martin is becoming Jordan (except that martin can write and Jordan sucks), the 4th book is out, a fifth on the way, and I don't see any end in sight or any way of wrapping it up in 2 or 3 books. It won't be a problem as long as it stays good and interesting but I hope he has end in mind.<br /><br />Overall the story was great and I enjoyed it immensely. If you enjoyed the other 3 you will enjoy this one as well. A great book a must read for any Martin Fan.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This CD is a f**king amazing CD....it has awesome lyrics, it has crazy drumming, the singing might take awhile to get used to but jesus, it is awesome...its too bad M. gave up screaming though....but his singing abilities now are pretty awesome....\\"Trashed and Scattered\\" and \\"The Wicked End\\" are my fav songs....they are great...they also throw in some spainsh guitar, and even solo with it......its f**king mind boggling
B000BBOUU4|5.0|It's better than the original, which I've never been able to sit through without looking at my watch. The best part of the original, and the part that is most faithful to the book--darling Charlie, his loving parents and the four grandparents in their beds in the one-room cottage--are here, cast beautifully. You will love them and care about them. The contest, the chocolate and other treats, and the Chocolate factory, and the other kids and parents, are all 100 times better in this movie. Then there's Johnny Depp, who is unrecognizable and wonderful and fabulous and funny as Willie Wonka. It's wry, it's funny, the songs are great. Buy this DVD as a great addition to the family's collection.
B000AP04FG|5.0|I had no idea what the movie was about and popped it in around 11:30 pm and ended up glued to the set until it was over.  I am just watching it again with my wife.<br /><br />Most of the movies I have seen lately have been lacking in something except the latest Harry Potter at the Theatre.  I found this movie to have the great movie potential like True Lies.  The actors do a very good job with their roles and the story line is compelling and not predictable.  Watch it and buy it.  Amazon has a great price on it too....
B00005MAM2|3.0|There are probably enough comments on here with 613 reviews at the time of writing that you already know this is a serious tale about the final evolution of man.  Though I will say you have to watch the movie a few times to catch the entire story and piece it all together. This movie is, after all, a digest of an extremely long manga run.  All in all they catch all the key points and bring it together pretty well.  (4 stars for the story and script). <br /> <br /> <br />The animation (especially for it's time) is superb.  Many modern anime series don't even hope to touch the visual quality and detail of Akira.  It's on par with Ghost in the Shell, or the recent re-release of Appleseed, with a little fudge factor for technology differences.  (5 stars). <br /> <br /> <br />Any anime nut worth his salt watches in the original Japanese.  Unfortunately my wife is not such a nut so I have to watch in English.  I don't recall who got the rights to make the original American/English release back in the late 80's.  Specifically the laser disk release.  Whoever it was called in a cast of serious voice actors and translators that did an astounding job in not only pure voice quality but also translating the story.  They didn't just do a literal translation.  They actually spent some time thinking about the story line and translated in order to provide an intelligent, adult, and coherent script.  As a result the English audio track on the early release was incredible! <br />  <br /> <br />Sadly with Pioneer taking the helm, the English audio track on this DVD edition is horrible!  The voice actors are very weak - to the point of being annoying, and much of the dialog is literally translated and comes across as childish.  It's like a bunch of 8th graders were turned loose on the script. <br /> <br /> <br />If you like to watch in Japanese the audio gets 5 stars.  If you like to watch in English I give it 1 star. <br /> <br /> <br />All in all you're no kind of anime fan if you don't at least see Akira, and most of you Japanese lovin' folks out there will love to own the DVD edtion.  Heck even the English isn't bad if you can tune it out.  I'm just spoiled by the old laser disc release.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|The main problem with this movie is that it makes the mistake in thinking that everyone is familiar with the series or story.  I didn't know that this movie was a live version of an animated series until after I saw the movie.  For me personally, it took too long to explain what the heck was going on.  Who was who and what was what.  When Trevor explains about some disease that left the world sterile and the whole cloning thing, I was like oh, okay...but it still didn't explain who the heck was the redhead speaking in everyone's ear and dispatching orders.  It's definitely not Catwoman 2, but I still feel that there are some vital pieces of this story on the cutting room floor.  So it was good, but not good.  Go figure.
B000099T2L|5.0|this is a simply amazing album.all the songs are great.this girl can really sing.this is a five time grammy award winning cd so you should definately listen to it.it is a fun cd to sing along to.give it a listen youll love it!!!!!!!!!

B000AOEMXM|2.0|First off, if you buy each of the 4 ST:ENT seasons separately, they collectively cost you less than $400 BUT if you buy them together in the form of this boxed set, it costs you $480. D-uh? Who came up with this brilliant marketing strategy? Shouldn't it be the other way around that if you buy the boxed set it should cost you LESS than buying each of the seasons separately? Who in his or her right mind is going to buy this offering?    (N.B. After I originally wrote this review, a 10% discount appeared bringing the price down to $431. Nice try, but buying the individual seasons separately STILL costs less than buying this boxed set!)    Now to rate the show itself, I think Enterprise started off on a good foot with good intentions but then lost its way. The theme of creating a retro series didn't suck. It wasn't a bad idea, but it seemed that as the further in the series went, the writers were struggling to find the show's calling. If you look at the other three series, namely, TNG, DS9 and Voyager, halfway into EACH of the series, they had each found their respective callings and directions, by the third season usually.     But in the case of Enterprise it seemed as if someone was trying to invent a new direction and find the show's way into every season and we were back at square-one. I personally feel that is what eventually became the show's undoing. With the other series, three seasons in the audience knew what they were coming back for -- they all started out sort of directionless but settled in by the third season. That never galvanized in the case of Enterprise and it looked like we were pursuing a completely new theme with each season. You could see the writers fumbling at times when you watch some of the episodes across the 4 seasons. That probably led to viewer loss. The effects were definitely better (obviously), the acting was not bad either.     Season 1 started off okay. But by season 2, loss of connecting elements and a cohesive theme was becoming apparent. Season 3 was a vagabond season in my opinion because it might have been good as a standalone season with the whole Delphic Expanse storyline but then the whole show just went 180 degrees when season 4 came and you mainly had all these \\"mini-plots\\" of 2 or 3 episodes filling it up, but no developing theme at the series level. Then suddenly half way into the fourth season it seemed as if someone told them to wrap it up and the fourth season's second half packed in storylines and plots that were meant to be told across 3 more seasons rather than half a season. The federation came into being, some band tried to derail it, someone got killed and we ended up with Riker and Troi in the finale -- fruit cocktail. The whole second half of the last season went by in an incoherent blur.    In simple words into the fourth season it fell apart. \\"All the king's horses and all the king's men could not put...\\"    In the end I think eventually die hard Star Trek aficionados will get this series irrespective. The production was good. It had its moments too and there are some brilliant episodes in many of the seasons but in the end the writers couldn't hold it together.    My 2-star rating applies not to the show itself, but to this ridiculous offering of a boxed set. I'd give the show itself a 3/5.
B00005ASGG|5.0|This one should be remembered as one of the finest westerns ever made. It pairs Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne as unlikely allies in a small western town. They are allies in that both are for the territory achieving statehood, against the interests of the cattle barons. They are unlikely in that Wayne plays a self reliant man who protects himself and his interests with a gun. Stewart plays an eastern lawyer who has moved west to seek his fortune. He tries to defend his interests with writs, warrants and flowery language. This is all well and good except when the bad guys don't care about such things and just shoot it out. Lee Marvin plays the bad guy, Liberty Valence, and makes this point rather dramatically as he goes around beating, shooting or whipping anyone who displeases him.  <br /> <br />Stewart's character grows in the course of the film. While he does maintain his ideals, he learns that sometimes a man has to defend himself. Wayne's character also undergoes changes although they are more subtle. He becomes slightly more \\"civilized\\" by the end of the film. In the course of these changes, they both come to respect each other and even consider each other friends. The friendship, though, is strained since both are interested in the same girl. <br /> <br />John Ford directed this classic. It has a fine blend of story, action, characterization, drama and the occasional comic relief provided by Andy Devine.  <br />
6305558167|5.0|This is a film of stark contrasts.  There are moments of intense and graphic violence, and moments of breathtaking beauty.  You can almost feel the cold and smell the forest.  Lovely, unusual and worth seeing. <br /> <br />

She is rumoured to be re-releasing this album again in late december, with a bonus disc of remixes. if these rumours prove to be true, then she has completely lost the plot, if she thinks people will buy this mediocre album a fifth time.

0684853523|4.0|Stephen King wrote \\"On Writing\\" while recovering from a near-fatal accident.  In it, King shares his memories of his hardscrabble upbringing in the self-described lower middle class Maine setting that is so authentically described in many of his books and stories.  It also contains his thoughts on the craft of writing, which may hold some interest for would-be writers.<br /><br />King's prolific career as a producer of horror and fantasy novels has probably obscured his undeniable talent as a writer.  In search of that type of success, King recommends disciplined work habits informed by lots of reading, and advises that writers should write what they know.  None of these ideas should surprise anyone in the writing business.  King's claim that his stories tell themselves and he doesn't need or use elaborate plot outlines may be both a surprise and a testimony to the richness of King's imagination.<br /><br />This short book is recommended to fans of Stephen King who may wish to know him better.  This book is also recommended to the aspiring writer looking for a few friendly tips.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have 4 SOAD albums and if you do too, you probably noticed how they progressed in skill and creativity... well, this is the peak of both... this album sounds horrible the first 2 days... but after, you will NOT be able to take it out of your cd player... i know i couldn't. This music is addictive, replayability is amazing, energy is disgustingly high. This album is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. Buy it, I'd advise you to.
B00005JMXX|2.0|This movie had a great potential to be entertaining, realistic (enough), and educational on consequences for a country that so often neglects the environment.  The movie started out this way, but the storm seems to almost have a life of its own (that it is almost hunting the main characters).  The movie plays over a few weeks (days? doesn't really specify very well), whereas it should have run over at least months if not a couple years to make it not completely implausible.  By ignoring reality to the highest degree, this movie disgraced those committed to preventing climate change (it made a mockery of it). <br /> <br />The movie started out well, suggesting that these things would take time to pan out.  Then, as the story gets going, the timelines are all wrong and the events are cut to weeks and then to ?days?.  The only reason I could possibly imagine that this was done was to try to get an rush for the audience and make this into a thriller movie, not a realistic one.  Because it was so over the top, I and apparently a lot of others who have reviewed this movie lost interest.  Instead of thinking, \\"Is this character going to live or die?\\" or \\"Wow, I can really see this actually happening,\\" you say to yourself, \\"Are you serious?  Why does the story keep changing?  None of this makes any sense in reality.  Hollywood sold out on an excellent idea for a horrible storyline.\\"  I could write about several parts in this movie that violated conservation of energy and simple physics laws -- it was done left and right and made the scientists look like idiots. <br /> <br />If you don't mind a movie that doesn't necessarily make sense, you will probably like this movie.  If you like movies that are  mildly plausible (or better), you will sit and question the entire second half of the movie (and laugh at them as they all attempt to walk hundreds of miles in the snow storm that is larger than a hurricane and reshapes the northern hemisphere).

B0000C0FJB|5.0|From the audience reaction as the first bars of Tom Sawyer appears until Working Man, the intensity in their playing is clearly evident.  <br /> <br />Rush in Rio is just exceptional, one of Rush's most spectacular gigs ever captured onto tape. The audience participation is one in a lifetime for the guys, easily every band's dreamed crowd. Brazilian crowd eruption is showcased as the monster on the cover, I think. Very funny and lovely. The whole enjoyment at the spectacle is unparalleled.  <br /> <br />Closer to the Heart makes the price of admission more than worth it. As the first few notes begin, and the crowd erupts in pleasure. But you can't notice this is Brazilians favorite Rush song, because they sing along with every single note, every beat, every chord!. AMAZING.  <br /> <br />Rush's energy is incredibly portrayed on stage. The setlist appears as impressive, and the 3 guys give their best, burning their respective instruments on stage!. What a magnificent drummings (and it isn't an exercise in self indulgence),  exhaustive bass playing, awesome guitarship, etc.  <br /> <br />highlights?. Well, 29 God-like performances, including an  incredible drum solo.  <br /> <br />Simply astounding. Simply impossible. Unquestionably, Rush In Rio is the definitive Rock concert performed by a single band ever. <br /> <br /> <br />
0060899190|3.0|Someone made the strange decision to have quite a few PostSecrets cover two pages.  In those cases the fold makes it difficult to read and destroys the visual impact of the post card.  That really irked me. <br /> <br />The other is that maybe 20% of the secrets take up an entire page.  Thus they look like billboards rather than post cards. <br /> <br />Frank Warren did a poor job on the layout of the book, which really minimizes much of the emotional impact.   <br /> <br />Also diminishing the overall impact was Warren's selection of which cards to publish.  There were far too many lightweight/trivial ones included in the book. Lessens the overall emotional impact and makes the book seem superficial like Chicken Soup For The Soul.  I know from faithfully reading tghe postsecret web site that Warren had a lot more dramatic cards he could have ncluded. <br /> <br />I bought it as a present for my daughter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I know some of you are going to say it's just plain sacrilegious but hey, just because everybody jumps into the lake....  \\"Thriller\\" is a great album with great tracks and because of a variety of fortunate reasons e.g. timeliness, MTV etc, has become the biggest selling album of all-time but that doesn't mean that everything else that MJ comes up with later that doesn't sell as much is crap.<br /><br />In fact, this is the album when MJ's weirdness first became pretty obvious.  \\"Hey! Is that really Michael on the cover?\\" was my reaction as well but I chose to look beyond the looks and not to judge the book by the cover and just listened to the tunes.  Some of my favourite MJ songs ever are on this disc.<br /><br />\\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is an MJ classic and clearly among his top 5 ever songs.  \\"Smooth Criminal\\" was always a great track even before Alien Ant Farm showed us why, \\"Liberian Girl\\" and \\"Man in the Mirror\\" are also great tracks and the rest of the tracks cannot be called album filler by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />The sound quality of this special edition has also been remastered to near perfection and the bonus interviews and tracks are a real bonus to fans.  This album grows on you over time and for me has aged a lot better than \\"Thriller\\" has.  Maybe I've heard \\"Thriller\\" too many times but give me a choice between the two if I had to put one of them on the cd player, I'd choose \\"Bad\\" any time and if not \\"Off the Wall\\" before I'd reach for \\"Thriller.\\"<br /><br />Get over the Wacko Jacko hangup and just judge the cd for the tracks if you can and then you'll see just how great this album really is.  This very well remastered and special edition is very highly recommended.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Yes I actually blew out my speakers with the first track. Ha ha..    The album starts out very strong, and I have to admit the first time I listened to it I got chills when it first started with Abba's \\"Gimme, gimme, gimmie\\" sampling. Yes I am a closet ABBA fan--but this album is much more than that. It is also not just a \\"reliving disco\\" album.    Shifting into track 2 things got a little more downbeat--it almost seemed like M should have moved track #2 further down the playlist.. 1->3->4->2 or something.    What I didn't like was the 5th/6th tracks.. I don't care about the Kabbalah stuff, nor whether she likes cities.. egads. Sorry M, I don't care. I don't like New Jersey. So what? Please stick to the music.    Overall this is a very strong album where M seems to be on the edge of putting out a kick-A** dance album, but gets a little too into herself with the spiritual hoo-ha. I'm all for her doing the spiritual stuff but please do it on another album; \\"Dance Songs of the Kabbalah\\" or something. (that was a joke)    I believe I understand what she was trying to do with this album, initially starting with the ABBA sampling, then moving forward. I think it was a great concept--if she'd have stuck to it. Or maybe she was trying to convey her life story through the album--I don't know but don't think so. Hopefully with the next one she'll stick to the music.    As a suggestion, I think if she'd have had a \\"professional\\" DJ help her to mix tracks & make suggestions, she'd have had a KILLER album! Maybe Digweed, Seaman, Tiesta.. or even Van Dyk; someone with a broad [dance] musical background with the ability to thread songs together. I also would've liked it a little more up-tempo as well. I really feel like I know what she was trying to do but seems like she kind of got lost halfway through, but picked up the trail near the end.    Overall it's a very good album.    Thanks Madonna!!
B000BJS4SU|1.0|I got this as a birthday present from a friend, since I like bluesrock type music. He heard it was good (probably from these WAY overhyped amazon reviews,,thanks a lot.) . Well nothing personal against my friend (*who shall remain nameless *cough*robbie*cough*) , but this record is lame. I am pretty open minded about music and listen to everything from Ben Harper to Classical to Amos Lee and everything in between. But being a fan in particular of bluesrock..(my favorite genre) i was even harder in my criticism than i would normally be. I'm sorry but it was way too wimpy for me. The guitar playing didnt blow me away, and the songs didnt have me wanting to listen over and over again. So what can i say, its a case of having a big name ,,, and people giving it good reviews on that merit. If this was made by some nobody I promise there would be nowhere near the number of good reviews this thing gets. It would have gone by unnoticed, and deservedly so.. its nothing you havent heard 100 times before by much more talented players.
B000BO0LLS|1.0|You heard it folks, it's coming your way. if you think a cheap poster, an extra video and six remixes of the same song are worth $27.99, then go ahead and place your pre-order. <br /> <br />let's hear the Lambs defend mariah's motives now!!
B000BOH8XW|4.0|I can't help but feel a little disappointed by this record as I was so pleased with the first one.  There are only a couple of great songs- How Do You Do and Costume Makes the Clown and a couple of okay songs- Dreams to Plans and Hey You.  Then there are a lot of boring songs.  I was especially disappointed with the English version of En Tus Pupilas entitled Something.  While the Spanish lyrics were crafty and laced with a sense of humor the English ones are just ordinary.  Eg. And even if we never marry, I will always love you baby... <br />That said, I still think she's a wonderful gift to the world and I look forward to the next time around.
B00005JNZJ|3.0|(3 & 1/2 stars) The original Aeon Flux animated series was extremely cool - stylish, sexy and inventive.  The new movie does an incomplete but mostly decent job of capturing what made the first Flux movie so good.  They even have the \\"fly in the eye\\" at the beginning.  Charlize Theron embodies the Aeon character pretty well, although I thought much of Flux's weary cynicism was missing from the portrayal.  The movie has its share of cool special effects, and the architecture and surroundings (set design) are all ultra-modern and great to look at.  The plot is nearly as incomprehensible as in the original (to be expected with any Aeon Flux flick).  The areas where I found the movie less than fully satisfying included the too-frequent sterile pauses in the story, especially the \\"talky\\" scenes, and also the shootout near the end.  It was a pretty plain action scene, especially by Matrix standards, and it was pretty much completely lacking in the original series' cleverness and creativity.<br /><br />One footnote, and a request to Amazon --- is it possible for your review-screening software to refuse to accept the word \\"idiot\\" from now on?  I enjoy reading the customer reviews, but I'm tired of seeing a reviewer call another person an idiot just because they don't share the same opinion.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This classic anime by Hayao Miyazaki pits a spunky, loving princess against those who misunderstand the precarious balance of nature in their diseased environment.  Like most Miyazaki heroines, Princess Nausicaa is an independent girl, full of wisdom despite her young age, and one who approaches life with both awe and determination.  When well-meaning but ignorant invaders from another land threaten to destroy the Valley of the Wind, Nausicaa must rely on her special understanding of nature to save them all.<br /><br />Some of the themes and undertones of later Miyazaki works can be seen in this earlier film. In particular, the environmental interdependence of man and his environment that later defines \\"Princess Mononoke\\" begins in \\"Nausicaa.\\"  The \\"ohmu,\\" giant armored bugs who attack when one of their own is injured, have the mysterious inner lives that many of the fantastical spirits/gods possess in \\"Spirited Away.\\"  His fascination with wind and flight , lush and complex scenery, and the dynamic \\"acting\\" of his characters mark \\"Nausicaa\\" as an archetypal Miyazaki work.<br /><br />Although I watched this anime in the original language with subtitles, Disney has assembled a remarkable cast of voices:  Uma Thurman, Chris Sarandon, Patrick Stewart, Edward James Olmos, Alison Lohman, and Mark Hamill.  (The extras in the DVD contain interviews with these English-speaking actors about their dubbing experiences.)  I watched bits with these voices, and they are actually quite good in that they capture the emotional force and rhythms (to a degree) of the original.  For those who get too distracted by reading subtitles , the high-quality dubbing should be appreciated.  Still, I am a purist, much preferring the original language.<br /><br />Because of its larger issues, Miyazaki's animation appeals to adults perhaps more than to children.  His intense battles and ominous creatures will probably frighten younger kids, hence the PG rating.  Highly recommended.
B0000029GA|5.0|I'll put it plain and simple: These rhymes are among the illest you will ever hear. Nas was a hungry 20 here, an underground MC looking for respect. He certainly got it with this gem; his flow is displayed on tracks such as Memory Lane, his storytelling on One Love, and meaningful lyrics on The World Is Yours. A brilliant classic. Standout tracks: Life's A ****, One Love, Memory Lane, The World Is Yours.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This is a good Batman movie. It tells the story of Bruce Wayne's life as a child and the psychological factors that made him become what he is today (although the Frank Miller graphic novel - Batman: Year One, does it much better). An all-star cast including Michael Caine, Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman firmly place the Batman franchise back in the land of professional acting... which is a world away from the television series which Burton dictated his direction from, comical bad guys and larger than life characters are nowhere to be seen, instead Gothem is gritty and the terrain that the caped crusader wanders in, is as real as our own. These are all major plus points especially when the two main villains, the Scarecrow and Ras Al Ghoul come to life. Unfortunately the action sequences tend to overshadow the storyline with unclear resolutions and grand finales that are not as satisfying as its predecessors with an end note that doesn't really sell that well to those who can literally remember watching Burton's versions as fresh as a daisy. Certainly heaps better than the latter Batman vehicles and worth owning, but at the same time doesn't really bring out the B in Batman.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is a great DVD.  Every time I have the chance to see Pink Floyd one more time, I take it and rejoice.      Now, to some reviewers still believing that PF died with Syd then again with Roger, I say ENOUGH with the ranting.  If you don't like Pink Floyd with David Gilmour then listen to something else.  We know that the band started with Syd (actually Nick and Roger are the two first surviving members of the various pre-PF bands, which subsequently led to the formation of PF).  We also know that Dave \\"replaced\\" Syd (actually he was added to the band as support in case Syd would default, and was not intended to replace Syd - it just turned out this way).  Dave cared enormously for Syd as demonstrated by Dave's production efforts of Syd's later solo albums and other initiatives and tributes.  We also know that Roger is talented and a brilliant lyricist, and the inspiration behind many PF landmarks.  But Syd left on his own, and Roger left on his own.  So be it.  We can't change the past.  To his credit, David Gilmour did what he had to do after Roger's departure because he loved Pink Floyd as a band, which at the time, was not what could be said about Roger.  Roger would never have been musically as creative if it had not been for Rick, David and Nick.  The impact of Rick and David in particular on the musical orchestration is immense (watch the making of Dark Side of the Moon and you will discover how Rick impacted the musical direction of many songs).  The difference between a good and a great song often lies in subtle elements - like the famous guitar lines on Wish You Were Here or Shine on You Crazy Diamond.  I love Gilmour.  Bravo for Pulse.  The more I see of Pink Floyd, in ANY version, the better.  Like a real person PF has evolved and changed, they have LIVED a full and creative life.  Pulse is about being ALIVE.  If the remaining members had no talent, they would not be able to play such impeccable performance of the entire DARK SIDE live on stage 20 yearsafter its original release. Because no matter your opinion, PF was still much better with Roger, than Roger is on his own, despite his undeniably impressive talent (and that of Jeff Beck) in \\"Amused to Death\\".  I like what Roger is doing, but I am not criticizing his work because he left PF.      Enjoy Pulse and the great memories that this DVD will surely bring back.  We will have to wait a long time before another band of the greatness of Pink Floyd comes around, if that ever happens, so let's enjoy what we do have.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Haunted by memories of a tragedy from his dirt-poor childhood, he struggles in the music industry until he finds his niche and releases on the world a new, incendiary sound that mixes genres and redefines boundaries, all while battling drug addiction and searching for a woman who will make him feel whole.<br /><br />But enough about the Ray Charles movie, let's talk about Walk the Line.<br /><br />Johnny Cash is brought to life on screen by Joaquin Phoenix, whose performance out-Foxxes all recent depictions of true-life characters. Phoenix's portrayal finds strength in the actor's ability to pay just enough attention to looking and sounding like Cash without letting it overwhelm him. Other \\"transformations\\" of celebrities (Foxx's Charles, Blanchett's Hepburn) seem to be more akin to a Darryl Hammond impression on SNL, as they focus on mimicking the person's mannerisms and end up losing their own humanity.<br /><br />Playing Cash requires Phoenix not only to sing (which Foxx did not), but also to love someone so deeply that the absence of her love drives him to self destructive practices. In the song that leant its title to this film, Cash tells us he keeps a close watch on his heart. He builds walls and drapes himself in black, keeping the world away. While Phoenix captures this stand-offish outward presentation of Cash, he also opens him up, exposing the singer's vulnerabilities. The mysterious Man in Black loves. He cries. He lives.<br /><br />June Carter (Reece Witherspoon) haunts the first hour of the film. She is ever-present in Cash's life, but out of his reach; he listen to her on the radio as a young boy and reads about her first marriage while stationed in Germany. Clearly, the film's central story is their love, told from Johnny's point of view. Once June becomes a steady force in the film, the narrative moves from being the story of Johnny Cash to their courtship. Witherspoon brightens her scenes with a perky energy that masks an inner turmoil equal to Johnny's. On stage, Witherspoon bests Phoenix (a major feat, as he is fantastic) and has a career in country music if this acting thing doesn't work out.<br /><br />Walk the Line's supporting characters read like a Who's Who of 1950s music. Elvis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison, etc. The two scene-stealing performances belong to unknown actors (unknown to me) playing Jerry Lee Lewis and Sun Records proprietor Sam Phillips. Phillips' first meeting with Cash provides the heart of the film, as he tells the young musician to sing as if he only has the chance to sing one song for the rest of his life. Phillips is rightly presented as a man who nurtured many young musicians and helped them find the voices that spoke to the masses.<br /><br />My only criticism of the film is criticism I have for most biopics. I expect more from a film than just giving an account of someone's life (Ray, Ali, Man on the Moon). Those stories should be reserved for made-for-tv movies. Walk the Line has great ambitions when concerning the presentation of the material, but a lot of compromises are made on content. Much of the story-lines are clich&eacute;d, as real life has been heavily sculpted to fit a conventional drama (I seriously doubt Cash's father and first wife are as one-dimensional as presented).<br /><br />But Walk the Line does not have the goal of competing with most other dramas. Primarily, it wants to remain faithful to the love story of Johnny and June Carter Cash and present their lives' work in a way that will entertain modern audiences as much as the toe-tappers who listened to them half a century ago. With those goals in mind, this film could not be improved in any way.equal to Johnny's.

B0007P3582|1.0|50 Cent, the biggest idiot and phony in hip-hop, recently released an album called \\"The Massacre\\". This is straight up garbage. He is way too lazy on this album, has flow reminiscent of Nelly, and is weak. In \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\", he came out hard, hungry for respect. He is lazy and puts in no effort into this waste. There are NO standout tracks, instead I'll say the WORST tracks: Candy Shop, Piggy Bank, Disco Inferno, God Gave Me Style. Hell to G-Unit, Hell to 50 Cent.
0060899190|4.0|I was suprised to find that the majority of these have been on the site at one time or another.  However, for those that might not have followed it closely you probably wont realize it anyhow.  That beaing said the book is thick, with nice quality prints.  The selection is good.  You will smile, cry, and most of all, everyone will relate with at least some of these confessions.  Just buy the book.
1591396190|5.0|The primary value of this very well written and very pragmatic book is in its radical treatment of the most fundamental business trade-off - \\"value-cost.\\"  It is universally believed that new product introduction (or product differentiation) inevitably results in higher costs.  The authors clearly show that this myth can be safely put to rest: there are robust approaches that allow for pursuing greater value and low costs simultaneously. <br /> <br />The innovative approaches introduced in the book could be considered revolutionary if not for the fact that most of them had been discovered in TRIZ many years ago.  (I don't accuse the authors in plagiarism; most likely, they have not heard of TRIZ when writing the book).  <br /> <br />It's not surprising that companies that implement the concept of Value Innovation eventually embrace TRIZ.  The best example is Samsung Electronics whose institutionalization of both VI and TRIZ allowed the company to become the global leader in consumer electronics (see the 75th anniversary issue of FORTUNE).   <br />
B000000Y87|5.0|This is an album that continues to amaze and please even after repeated hearings.  The whole trio sings together beautifully, Evans touch and taste are magnificent, the trio plays together seemlessly, with great interplay.  There's no banging or straining here, there's in fact a certain seeming reserve to the playing and yet underneath a great intensity and sense that something very interesting and expressive is going on.  In other spheres this would be called \\"being in the zone\\" ...  <br /> <br />The emotional level of the music is subtle, a certain joy from the singing emerges and yet also a sense of pain and sadness at times.  It is this delicate balance that Evans achieves here and in the best of his trio work that makes his music so emotionally mesmerizing ...   <br /> <br />Anyway ... this might just become one of your all-time favorite albums.  But beware:  take a listen first.  There are some people that just don't get it.  This is not a heavily swinging sort of jazz.  Some find this trio work frankly boring, sleep-time, sort of cocktail loungs music and nothing more. On some of Evans poorer efforts (e.g. \\"Moonbeams\\") i think this criticism gains some valdity (but take in context: Evans music is always pretty darn good).   But in general this view is not right and on his best trio albums, like this one, you might say we are talking about high art.
B000BKDOCA|5.0|I've not always been a Britney Spears fan... in fact I really only like her music from In The Zone and up. I must say that I think her music is really shaping into something good. This remix album further compliments her growing into a talented artist. I won't give a play by play, there are plenty of those already but I will say that this album will not disappoint those who enjoy Britney and good dance music. It is top notch. I can't quite understand why the record label did not promote this album. I did not hear of it until I needed to redownload the album from Rhapsody and saw this album at the top. It amazes me because even if the album sucked (which it doesn't) it would still sell millions just because of the Britney name... baffling.
6300147983|1.0|I saw the touring version of A Chorus Line when I was a kid, so when it came to the big screen years later I was something better.  Maybe it was growing up seeing all of the film musicals, or having gone to theatre school, but the very heart of what the play was about is gone.  I agree with several of the reviewers who said that the director didn't know what the play was about.  It is not about young kids trying to get into a show, it about what makes up the very real world of being a Broadway Chorus dancer.  You are not the star, you are just trying to keep on doing something you love.  Its not pretty and the people cast are not right for the roles except for a few.  I saw the film when it came out and several times on tv.  At some point, I just turn it off.  Another thing that ruins it is the fact that the director does not know how to shoot dancers.  There a lot of unnecessary movement of the camera while they are singing so that you don't see the whole body of the dancers.  Long ago it was said that you should shoot dancers full body, Bob Fosse knew that, the brillinat musical directors of the past knew that, but Richard Attenbury didn't and should never have been picked to do this film.  Attenbury was a great director but for a musical no, this can also be said for John Huston, who directed Annie, although somewhat better.  The whole Cassie/Zach plotline should have stayed regulated to the background, I could have cared less about their story, and the actress who played Cassie is not memorable.  It was the dancing and why the characters were there that I cared about.  The songs weren't great but on a Broadway stage, just came off better.  Here they seem just about making the grade, but not by much.  If you want to see a film about Broadway dancer, and the audition process, then rent All That Jazz.  I auditioned for Broadway shows, I'm not a dancer, I have a lot of friends who are, and this film is not it.
0140131558|5.0|In Auster's seminal work he demonstrates his incredible understanding, his deep comprehension of both the City of New York and of human nature.  The book is in three parts, and they are distinct.  Yet each part is only a part of the inner nightmare that makes up the story of one who is hiding.  The three together make a whole; completing the message of his thoughts. <br /> <br />The book takes the form of a detective story.  The first part/book is about a man hired as a private detective to watch a man.  He is hired to watch this man because he is a threat to those who hired him.  They live in fear that this man will come after them and kill them.  He goes so far as to hide out in an alley for months, watching, waiting to see when the man will come.  Yet he never does. <br /> <br />The second part/book is a more abstract version of the first.  Rather than use actual names for the characters, they are instead called by colors; Blue, Gray, Green, Violet, etc.  As he moves through this story and the entire book, he shows his mastery of the knowledge of the City of New York in ways that most of us only contemplate.  He shows the lives of beggars, strangers, non-existent personages; that yet do exist in form and touch and shadow, but never truly interact in a real and tangible way with anyone that they meet. <br /> <br />In his third part/book, things start to fall into place.  We find a man who is living in an almost dream state.  He goes through life without really touching it; without really tasting it; without really feeling it.  He goes on a search, a journey to find another.  And when he does not find him, he tries to forget and go back to his life. <br /> <br />But throughout, we see a man hiding.  He hides from everything.  He hides from people and things.  He tries to rationalize this hiding in many ways.  Yet, he is not totally able to do so.  Not until he realizes, that he is hiding from himself.  Only then does he understand that his quest was self made.  Then he understands that one can disappear within oneself for as long as one wants; forever in fact.  Because one can fear no one or no thing more than one can fear oneself.  To lie to yourself is the ultimate lie, to hide from yourself is the ultimate disappearance.  This message is what Auster so ably conveys in his \\"New York Trilogy.\\"  And the City of New York is truly a magical and wondrous place to illustrate his point.  It is in this City that those who hide from themselves are so plentiful and obvious.  It is also in this City that those of true greatness come to fruition.  Auster's book is recommended for all readers who have a great desire and sense of introspection; a desire to understand those things that they try to hide from, yet cannot.  It will surely live on as one of his greatest works, and a superb example of modern fiction. <br />
B000002ULO|5.0|This album sometimes gets unfairly overlooked.  For example, recent critical raves over \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" often state that it's \\"the best MACCA album in years\\", forgetting that \\"Flaming Pie\\" is as recent as 1997.  The reality is that after McCartney's Wings period that yielded several excellent albums topped by \\"Band on the Run\\" and \\"Venus and Mars\\", his best 1980s album was \\"Tug of War\\" (with a solid B+ to \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\") and his best 1990s album was \\"Flaming Pie\\" (with \\"Run Devil Run\\" a solid second). <br /> <br />After the disappointing 1993 \\"Off the Ground\\" release, \\"Flaming Pie\\" was a return to form for McCartney, clearly influenced (as Paul acknowledges) by his experience with preparing \\"The Beatles Anthology\\".  Critics generally agreed, and for once they were right.  Basically, you'd have to dislike the Beatles not to like \\"Flaming Pie\\", as this is as good as a Beatles album.  \\"Calico Skies\\" is a wonderful acoustic piece that ranks up there with \\"Blackbird\\" and \\"Mother Nature's Son.\\"   \\"Young Boy\\" is one of MACCA's finest pop songs, with a great guitar solo by Steve Miller-- unfortunately this tune didn't get much mileage being the feature song running over the opening titles to the rather lackluster Billy Crystal/Robin Williams comedy \\"Father's Day.\\"  \\"Souvenir\\" would have fit nicely on the White Album.  \\"Flaming Pie\\" fits into a long line of rollicking McCartney piano-based classics.  The somber \\"Somedays\\" and \\"Little Willow\\" are typical beautiful McCartney melodies.  The big closing ballad \\"Beautiful Night\\" has a great orchestral build-up courtesy of George Martin, while the short acoustic actual final track \\"Great Day\\" is so poignant in retrospect knowing that this is Linda's last time singing on a Paul album (notwithstanding his production of Linda's posthumous album \\"Wide Prairie\\").  \\"The World Tonight\\" and \\"The Songs We Were Singing\\" makes me wish McCartney would work more with Jeff Lynne-- who after all, did wonders in reviving George Harrison's solo career in the 1980s.  But let's be clear-despite the lumps from lots of idiot critics, the truth is that McCartney has written a number of classic songs since 1970 that are of \\"Beatles-caliber.\\"  He's not the greatest editor of his own material, leaving songs on some albums that make you scratch your head, but when he gets it right (like \\"Flaming Pie\\" and the new \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\") the results really do recapture the Beatles magic.     <br /> <br />
B000BP86OG|5.0|Holy crap, I did not expect this at all, \\"The Darkness\\" and RTB have blown all my hopes out of the water with \\"One Way Ticket\\". It is now one of the precious few cds (Abbey Road, Electric Ladyland, Dark Side of the Moon...) that after my first hearing, I quickly pressed play again...and again and again.  <br /> <br />\\"OWTtH\\" is a massive improvement over PTL (which I found repetitive and overlong) in nearly every way, songs, instrumentation, singing, playfulness (knob jokes!), production, and even the  solos! There is no filler whatsoever (funnily enough, in all the reviews I've read, a song complained about by one reviewer is very often loved by another) and each and every single track is packed with more ideas than most modern albums altogether (and, except the epic 'Bald', fit under a refreshing 3 and a half minutes).  <br /> <br />I don't want to ruin any of the freshness and originality of this inspired album, so I'll leave the review at this, BUY THIS ALBUM, the world needs the darkness...
0451191153|5.0|I have never met a book where the author and people living within the pages so quickly and clearly become part of the fabric of me.

B00005LMBK|5.0|I like this album alot better than Demon Days. Not to say Demon Days was bad, but this is definitely Gorillaz best.
B0002OERI0|3.0|Yes boys and girls, like many bands before them, Green Day has sold out. Just like Metallica did with that crappy arse 'Load' album after releasing 5 great albums a decade ago (I actually liked the 'Black Album'). 'American Idiot', admitably, is not a bad album, but it is nowhere near the bands previous work, the songs are not imeadiatly gripping like old Green Day, and the theme of the album is dark, murky, and hard to listen to. I like some dark albums, but this just goes way overboard. And the president bashing, I am a proud liberal, and I hate president Bush with my life, but the over the top and annoying political bashing of this album almost made me consider changing my political stance. <br /> <br />What's worse about American Idiot is that, despite the fact that it is by far Green Day's worst album, is their most commercially sucessful. If I hear that boring and annoying 'Wake Me Up When September Ends' on the radio one more time I will shoot someone, and now little 5 year old girls are running around in Green Day T-shirts because Green Day is suddenly on Top 40 stations all the time. Please, end this. <br /> <br />What ever happend to that snotty, fun loving trio of punks from Northern California we knew and loved in the 90's, because I liked them a lot better than these makeup-wearing corporate sellouts. This year we saw two once great pop-punk bands sell out, Green Day and Weezer, let the memory of their better days (and rocks better days in the 90's) rest in peace.
B00004VY1A|4.0|When his growing legions of fans work their way back through the early films of Peter Jackson to determine how the man who started off directing comic gorefests like \\"Bad Taste\\" and \\"Dead Alive\\" ended up being entrusted with \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" this 1996 film will be the last link in the chain because it was after \\"The Frighteners\\" that Jackson devoted himself to bringing Tolkien to the big screen. Like every film he has ever made, \\"The Frighteners\\" shows a relentless creativity, although ultimately the story is not up to the impressive special effects. Consequently, while enjoyable, the film is also somewhat disappointing because we really expected something better in a film where Jackson finally had money to play with.<br /><br />\\"The Frighteners\\" is a horror-comedy that falls a bit short of both halves of the equation although it starts off strong enough. Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) is a paranormal investigator who shows up in the small town of Fairweather, California. Bannister is a most unusual con artist, because not only can he really see ghosts, he has three of them working for him: Stuart (Jim Fyfe), Cyrus (Chi McBride), and the Judge (John Astin). The ghostly trio put the fear of the undead into someone and then Bannister shows up and drives them away: for a small fee (with a money back guarantee). But then the husband of Lucy Lynsky (Trini Alvardo) drops dead and so do a lot of other people in town, all from heart attacks, and usually after seeing Bannister. He knows that the killer is the Soul Catcher, because he can not only see it attack, he can see the numbers that appear on the foreheads of his intended victims. Then things get complicated.<br /><br />By the time we find out what the opening scene of the film, where unseen spirits are terrifying loony old Patricia Ann Bradley (Dee Wallace-Stone), the contrivances are too mind-numbing to really care. Apparently there is a point to all this having to do with the competitiveness of Americans even in the realm of serial killing. Bannister's attempts to play the hero are consistently thwarted by Milton Dammers (Jeffrey Combs), an F.B.I. agent who is equal parts hardcase and nutcase. Every time he did something weird I found myself saying, \\"Well, okay then.\\" His antics usually engendered a laugh, but it was just never quite the right type of laugh, having too much of a skeptical edge to it. If there is one think you do not want you audience to be when you are doing a horror movie with ghosts, it would be skeptical.<br /><br />Despite the problems with the convoluted narrative and the uneven tone of the comedy, this is still a film worth watching just to see what Jackson pulls out of his special effects bag of tricks next. Clearly the best of the pre-LOTR movies from Jackson is definitely \\"Heavaenly Creatures,\\" which speaks to the director's strengths in terms of not just special effects but also with adaptations, whether from a literary classic or from infamous historical events. This means that his announced next project, a remake of \\"King Kong,\\" plays to these strengths as well.ns even in the realm of serial killing.

0307276902|5.0|This book was raw, deep, and personal but necessary.  I think it give a deeper appreciation about being happy with your life.  It reminds me of chaming little book called The Little Boy by Rohan Hall that I just read that teaches happiness and faith.  Sometimes it's hard to see the light through the darkness but these books certainly help - which makes me happy.
B00005JL78|4.0|Minority Report is my second favorite Science Fiction film, after Blade Runner. This is a great film with a complicated plot that twists and turns for 2.5 hours.  <br /> <br />The acting is superb. Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow deliver the expected high level professional preformance. If you doubt Cruise's acting ability, look at the scene in which he searchers a crowded public pool for his missing son, frantically calling his son's name. Or watch the scene where the precog, Agatha, reveals the story of the life his missing son could have lived (and then in a great plot twist - we find out she is seeing not the life of the missing son but the life of the yet to be born son). Watch Cruise hang on her every word despite the pain he feels. Colin Farrel does a really good job of showing us a multi-layered personality. He first comes off as a smart-aleck Justice Department attorney conducting an investigation on a pilot program nearing completion. Then he reveals he is a former cop and we see him become more brawny as he fights Cruise in an automobile factory. The viewer is pulled for loyalty between the fugitive Cruise, whom we think is innocent, and the ambitious newcomer Agent Witwer who reveals to us scene by scene a man of competence and justice seeking truth. It is when the viewer fully realizes that Agent Witwer is actually an upright guy, that he is most in danger of falling victim to the dark forces of Washington policy masters.Samatha Morton does a great job of playing Agatha, gradually coming out of her coma and revealing past, present, future to an endangered man who may help reveal the crime and criminal behind her mother's death.   <br /> <br />Never underestimate Phillip K. Dick. In \\"Bladerunner\\" he was able to construct a great science fiction story around existentialism. In \\"Minority Report\\" he resurrects the ancient Oracles of Delphi and builds an action packed story around Free Will and Determinism. It is a strength of this film that at multiple points,the characters are faced with a decision that appears to be foretold but which is still in play. Agatha, the precog, whispers \\"you can choose\\" at the most critical of these points and the film firmly supports that we as humans can exert our free will but within a deterministic context.  Cruise selects not to kill Leo Crow, the criminal who supposedly kidnapped and killed his son, even though all the precognitions reveal an image in which it appears that he does kill Leo. This is the point in which he exerts his free will, his freedom to chose his course of action, and yet we also see how a structured deterministic world still confines that choice. However once the choice is made, a new future of causative links unfolds and the consequences for freedom take their path.  Phillip K. Dick creates a world for us here in which we see that freedom of choice and pre-ordained determinism co-exist and that the consciousness of a good man makes all the difference. <br /> <br />Two final comments on the technology of the future: first, the film rightly shows that customer consumer patterns will become so tailored that marketers will be  able to show you exactly what you are looking for before you aware you are looking. Also, the criminal files contained in the precognitive visions were fascinating as both Cruise and Farrell pulled them across the screen for analysis. But, they were essentially images pulled across the desktop of the future, much like we pull documents from a file as we sit at our desks today. <br /> <br />Good acting, witty and suspenseful, intelligent and complicated plot, philosophical underpinning, and fantastic art direction and special effects all come together to make Minority Report an excellent film.
B000002TQV|5.0|Pablo Honey was too grungy, 2nd generation Nirvana. OK Computer got boring at times despite being great. Kid A and Amnesiac were a bit too wierd. Hail To The Theif had too much piano and not enough guitar. The Bends suffers none of these flaws, it's very unique, but not too obscure, catchy, but not poppy, guitar driven rock. If you have heard about Radiohead, like what you've heard and are thinking of trying them out, I suggest you buy this album first. All the songs are great (except Sulk, which is more on the \\"pretty good\\" level).
0316776963|5.0|I won't give away any of the stories (although you can surely find summaries here) I won't beat around the bush- simply put , this book is 'whack'!!! I mean funny! part of the book seems to be written under the influence of something because its just too funny...whatever the case... crack... or hopefully, be it divine inspiration from God... these short essays are hilarious. Mr.David Sedaris' writings still stick w/ me and moments later I am found laughing about them and a buddy thinks what is wrong with you (you have one of those halcion smiles like a plastic person)  or why I won't let them in on my cosmic joke.
0553801503|5.0|George Martin has succeeded in creating one of the best fantasy epics ever, and it continues here again, with his compelling characters and well plotted story. Unlike, say, Robert Jordan, he has not gotten lost in conceit and drivel. The story moves forward and has clear tension and struggle, moving towards confrontation. If I have one quibble with this, and books like it, at this point it would've been nice to have had a synopsis of the prior volumes. It's been awhile and there is a lot of prior story to remember. These long series can be hard to manage. (This was reviewed based on an ebook version...)
B000AL730O|4.0|...because this album is not going to nail you the first time you hear it.  It's a bit like wine that isn't all that satisfying the first time you drink it, but the more you drink it, the more seductive - and intoxicating - it becomes.  At first, I was fearful that Mac was again indulging the worst side of his musical tendencies: writing cute little jingles and ditties that would have impressed your grandmother, but Lennon - who he has said he still \\"looks to\\" for guidance - would have dismissed. <br />But on repeated listening, Mac's unbeatable melodic sense coupled with some truly fine lyrics and good hooks hook you.  Example: listen to the first few seconds of either \\"Promise to You Girl\\" or \\"Anyways\\".  The former hooks you with a great melody, great lyrics, and Paul's aging but effective pop voice.  On the latter, it's a simple piano riff that pulls you under his spell. <br />The lyrics deserve special mention, as these are the finest lyrics Paul's written since \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\", and I suspect Elvis Costello had a hand in those.  Listen for the subtle swipe Paul takes at Bush on \\"Vanity Fair\\".   <br />I do wish McCartney would plug in his Les Paul, turn the amps to 11, and write songs using just that equipment, because I suspect that the results would be terrific.  But in the meantime, pour yourself some English tea and fall under the spell of \\"Chaos\\".
B000003TA4|5.0|...this is a great album. I don't care how popular it is, I don't care that it's on the radio all the time, I don't care that kids who listen to emo like it, this is still a great album.
B000BGH22W|4.0|Overall, Patrick Doyle's composition was great, he's very good at representing darkness through the music.  And the three vocal songs from the Yule Ball were great.  (If the music wasn't played during the Yule Ball, I would have hated having this music.  There is no place for vocal music in the background for this type of film) <br /> <br />My only gripe about the soundtrack is that John Williams theme is nowhere to be found.  I understand that the reason for having a new composer is to come up with new themes for various things, but the main theme that is so recognizable as the Harry Potter theme by everyone who's seen the films should not be cut out completely.  For this reason alone, I had to mark down the soundtrack, but if I could have given it four and a half, I would have <br /> <br />I haven't seen the film as of yet, so if the theme is still in the movie, I apologize.  I'm going by what I heard on the soundtrack.
B000000993|4.0|I know a lot of my fellow Tool fans disagree with me with this, but I tink Undertow is Tool's worst album (not including their EP, which was not that great), in fact, if you ask me Tool has consistently gotten better (Lateralus, the most recent, is the best). None the less this is a good album, although the singles, \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex\\" are probably the best songs on the album. I like the title track a lot too. This album is definitly worth buying if you are a Tool fan or a fan of this kind of music, but I will say that Tools other two full lengths are better.
B000AP04FG|3.0|I think this movie could have been so much better if the storyline and writing were better.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are fun to watch together, but after a while, the movie gets to be a little boring.  The action scenes pick up the movie a bit, but when the movie ended, I thought it was too long and that they wasted an opportunity to have a really clever, slick story.  I know a lot of people really liked this movie, but this is just my opinion - it wasn't as good as it should have been.
B000000OQF|5.0|On their debut, GNR stick to this great Aerosmith/Stones esque style that set them apart from the rest of the LA hair metal scene of the 80's (most of the bands on that scene sucked, for your information), but not GNR, this just hard pounding, head banging, good time, pure Rock N' Roll the way it should be. GNR kept metal alive, and hopefully followers of this band can keep it alive longer.
B000BYY0RY|5.0|Kylie's most ultimate concert ever is coming to DVD, and it's a must have for all music lovers. Stylish backdrops, stunning costumes and eye-catching dancers provide a feast for the eyes, nearly distracting viewers from the lady herself.<br /><br />24 of her most loved singles from PWL, deconstruction and Parlapone, plus what is probably most fans favourite non-single track `Dreams'. And, in case this isn't enough, there are also covers of Judy Garland's immortal classic `Over The Rainbow', and Pet Shop Boys `In Denial'.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to go to 2 shows, and I admit I was surprised by the strength of her voice - she really can hit the high notes. Just wait to you hear `Confide In Me' and `Over The Rainbow'.<br /><br />I have to admit my favourites were the classic PWL hits, all our favourites are here: `Better The Devil You Know', `Shocked', `What Do I Have To Do', `Je Ne Sais Pas Pourquoi', `Hand On Your Heart', `Locomotion', `I Should Be So Lucky' and `Especially For You'.<br /><br />Another stand out number is `I Believe In You'; it really took my breath away - just superb! `Come Into My World', `Put Yourself In My Place', `Chocolate' and `On A Night Like This' are all hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />Then there's Kylie's current, and most popular Parlapone sound. `In Your Eyes', `Giving You Up', `Spinning Around', `Red Blooded Woman' (Medley with `Where The Wild Roses Grow'), `Slow', `Please Stay', `Your Disco Needs You', `Can't Get You Out Of My Head' and `Love At First Sight' all passionately sung by our favourite pop princess!<br /><br />And don't forget the extras: a backstage documentary, screen visuals and ROM section for your computer, so you can download screen savers and wallpapers.<br /><br />Get well soon Kylie, we all miss you!!
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets has to be one of the best albums of all time, any music genre, period the end. It just has this amazing atmosphere to it. As usual, the band operates with layers of sound, almost like an orchestra. This album though, has some really great arangements, and imeadiatly addicitive tracks. Best songs are the title track \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" and \\"Leper Messiah\\", but there all great. If you like metal you HAVE to own this album.
B000002GXS|5.0|If you are even curious enough to look at this CD, I can tell that this is one for you.  Buy this album before any.  His voice is brilliant and even greater are the songs that will make you dance at first and then drift you into a dream.  Waits has a gift for writing brilliant songs.   <br />If you own \\"Small Change\\" or any other album make this your next purchase.  Forget what you hear this is the greatest Tom Waits CD ever.  It is ashame that he never stayed like this for long.  My god, click \\"Buy now\\" and pay for one day shipping, this will meesmorize you.
0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, reveals the world of delusional war veteran, Billy Pilgrim. Written as an anti-war novel, Vonnegut demonstrates how war can have harrowing effects on the mentality of survivors of war. A survivor of the Dresden fire-bombing, Pilgrim becomes \\"unstuck in time\\" as the novel relates a series of non-chronological events in Billy Pilgrim's life. The novel incorporates the protagonists' time travel through the different stages of his life, which Billy is unable to control. Another aspect of the novel is Billy's abduction by the Tralfamadorians, who relate their view of time. They believe that time is not linear, but exists as a forth dimension. The philosophy of the Tralfamadorians overshadows the idea of free-will, as they believe that each moment in time happens in the only way that that moment could occur, and they learn to accept their destiny. Billy Pilgrim learns to accept their philosophy, and thus accepts his life and death. Slaughterhouse-Five forces the reader to question the sanity of Billy Pilgrim; and in turn it leaves the reader to his or her own conclusions. Overall, this book is a great read, giving insight to Vonneguts' life, the structure of time, and the traumatic effects of war.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Here's a real shocker. Not only were Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker able to put aside their differences to appear onstage again together, but they also did so without making any concessions to nostalgia. In other words, the psychedelic painted guitars are nowhere to be found; Clapton never uses his wah-wah pedal; Marshall amplifier stacks are missing in action; and session musicians are never carted onstage to duplicate the arrangements of the original recordings. This is all for the better - because nostalgia aside, most of Cream's vintage live recordings indicate that they were a fuzzed-out, self-indulgent mess onstage in the late 1960s. (They did great studio recordings, however, and their relatively short BBC live appearances were good) <br /> <br />This time around, there's a professionalism and musical maturity that was lacking in so much of Cream's live output in late 1960s. Bruce, Baker, and Clapton seem to be listening to each other rather than simply using each other as a springboard for solos. This doesn't make for many fiery, strenuous moments but it does make for consistently solid and ingenious jamming throughout the two-DVD set. It's a pleasure to see Clapton once again playing with musical peers rather than leading a band, and it's also a delight to watch a rock reunion where the members seem to actually enjoy each other's company again rather than just the renewed royalty checks. The band also omits several of their overplayed classic rock hits such as \\"Strange Brew,\\" \\"I Feel Free,\\" and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses\\" in favor of mostly less-familiar material. <br /> <br />Bruce's bass work is as fluid and musical as ever, and Baker does a great job streamlining his complex drum fills so that they complement the band better. I'm a Clapton fan, but I'm the first to admit that Clapton wisely stepped back from his usual role at bandleader and submerged his ego to the entire group. If you're looking for Clapton's solos to dominate, you'd better look elsewhere. <br /> <br />
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|First of all wimps posers and people that scare easily should stay away from this album it will give you nightmares I love Behemoth all the songs on their cd Demigod are just relentless from Nergal's  Growling vocals with Inferno's drums and Orion's bass make the band  Behemoth's cd Demigod is worth purchasing
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I own a copy of this film on laser disk and looked forward to seeing this edition for months. It was a major disappointment to me. I seems to me that most DVD producers put their special features with a wide screen edition. Unfortunately Disney elected to associate the comentary and extended version with the full screen version which omits a lot of visual detail from the sides and is more grainy than the wide screen edition. And one of my favorite songs from the laser disk is only found on the full screen version. For those who own the laser disk edition I would recommend that you don't purchase this DVD.
B000BJS4OY|5.0|It's hard to fathom, but before Bruce Springteen's Born To Run was released in 1975, Columbia was pondering whether or not to keep Springsteen signed to their label. With the initial disappointing sales of his first two albums, Greetings From Asbury Park and The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street Shuffle (both released in 1973), Born To Run was Springsteen's make or break album for the narrow-sighted suits at the record label. As we now know, Born To Run exceeded all expectations and ultimately landed Springsteen on the covers of Time and Newsweek simultaneously in the fall of '75. In 1974, Jon Landau, (who would later become Springsteen's co-producer on Born To Run and his manager), attended one of Springsteen's concerts and said \\"I have seen the future of rock and roll and it's Bruce Springsteen.\\" Never was a statement about \\"The Boss\\" so accurate. This new 3-disc collection is astounding in every aspect. The original disc is remastered to such perfection that your woofers and tweeters will be more than grateful. The second and third disc are comprised of a 1975 two hour plus concert filmed in London that easily shows us why Springsteen earned his status as one of the greatest musicians ever to grace a stage with his legendary performances. The Documentary disc is a fascinating view on the making of Born To Run, with new interviews and rare archival footage PLUS live performances from 1973. Accompanying this trio of treats is a 45-page book of rare and unpublished photographs. If you are a fan of Springsteen's, or know of one, this box set IS the ultimate gift. This 3-disc collection easily earns a five star rating. Spectacular!
6304712936|5.0|The first time I saw Amadeus, I was totally sympathetic to Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) and felt towards Mozart practically the same as Salieri did. 15 years later I watched the movie again. As I allowed myself to perceive it more in the position of Mozart, I couldn't help swinging my vote to Mozart this time. The more so as the movie depicted how Mozart, deprived of wealth and success, was initially reluctant to take a mystery man's proposal - to work on Requiem. He simply could not face his own demons and revisit his guilt towards his father, plus he lacked the energy to finish such a grand project. But for that promised pay, he took Saleri's bait, forced himself to meet the impossible deadline and work until his last breath. The final hours of Mozart was brilliantly portrayed by Tom Hulce. The last scene where Mozart was thrown into an unmarked mass grave was devastating.       The script was ingeniously written and tightly knit. The music score powerful and touching. The movie presented sympathetic and unbiased views of Salieri and Mozart at the same time. Coupled with fine performances of the two actors, the movie allowed the audience to see and judge for themselves. Abraham's brilliant portrayal of Salieri won him the Oscar - Salieri could not accept how Mozart, in a life style so different from his, could write such magnificent pieces.  Consumed with envy, he set out to block Mozart from any recognition of his talent. Even to this extreme, he was Mozart's admirer as much as Mozart's enemy till the end, secretly watching Mozart's play, the Magic Flute, and eagerly helping Mozart record his last notes for the Requiem.     The movie inspires. One Chinese proverb about two competing talents with only one as the ultimate winner can be adapted to the movie: \\"If Salieri is already born to this world, why bring Mozart also?\\" - a remark made by the loser as to his misfortune to be a contemplary of the winner and thus the loser failed to make his own mark in history.It also supports the idea \\"Who knows oneself better than one's deadliest enemy?\\" The movie also reminds me of the biblical parable of Lazarus and the wealthy man. While Lazarus, unlike his wealthy neighbour, was poor and constantly starving in his few days on the earth, it was Lazarus who was in Abraham's bosom to enjoy a happy after life while his neigbour suffered down below. Thus set eyes not just on the present but on the eternal. So went Mozart and Salieri according to the fiction and the movie.     A great movie! Incidentally, 27th January, 2006 marked the 250th Anniversary of Mozart's birth.
B00008H2LB|1.0|1 star is too high for rating this cr@*, but unfortunately there isn't an option avaiable to give it 0 stars. <br /> <br />It's incredible this music (can I call it so?) became popular. <br /> <br />Every song by LP is repetitive. They play 3 powerchords over and over again, add some dull screaming to it and effects.  <br /> <br />Who listens to Linkin Park? Of course people with no good musical tastes. And those are mainly 10-years old kids who wanna be \\"cool\\". Oh, they may be a bit older.

I was so excited when I saw there was a book coming out.   <br />I was a bit dissappointed because I didn't think there were a lot of new Postsecrets included in the book. <br />But a lot of the post secrets still make me cry. <br />It's still a pretty good book over all though.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|This is the most unispired Enya I have ever heard.  Prediction -  it will sell on the strength of a loyal following, but no way is there a hit on this.<br /><br />If you want to hear something different try Gorillaz or Fall Out Boy or Death Cab for Cutie.<br /><br />I know my fate already - you will say that this review was not helpful to you.  Well stop by my house a karate chop with your name in it is waiting.
B000B8QEZG|3.0|From Smother Magazine smother.net:<br /><br />Madonna once again reinvents herself and her image with her latest offering \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\". The album lives up to its title with bouncy New Wave floor fillers that toss aside her past exploits into club-friendly numbers and chooses to up the ante quite dramatically. Overall I feel that the album is a disappoint, there's plenty of great moments-her latest single \\"Hung Up\\" with its ABBA sample and great use of filters in the bridge is astounding. On \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", Madge upstages J.Lo's attempt at recreating \\"Flashdance\\" by perfecting the New Wave club `80's pop sound complete with vocoders, retro analog synth sounds, and other clich&eacute;s from the past (that Madonna was originally a part of I might add). But the juicy guts sound too much like a marketed attempt at cashing in on the latest fad of New Wave that bands like The Killers and so many others have been leaning on after the mainstream's exhaustion of the refurbished `70's garage rock sound that so many \\"The\\" bands worshipped. She's starting to show her age with her ridiculous attempt at bringing back spandex shows off her not-quite-as-hot-as-it-used-to-be body. But really anyone who would rhyme so badly in \\"I Love New York\\"-dork with New York?-doesn't still deserve all the attention that her entourage, Kabbalah fad, Material Momming, pop culture shock yearns for. But she still is better than J.Lo any day of the week.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Too bad people with supposed blues roots can't recognize the potential in a good musician with emotion and skills. Perhaps people are too stuck on compartmentalizing the musician inspite of the music. John is a good song writer, and getting better. And as far as his guitar playing, i applaud his sense of timing and power to improvise. If you've never really heard the blues this is a good place to start. Don't listen to the 40+ year old blues veteran raised on the blues, they'll only discourage you from being a part of their elite group. Forget the blues elitists, their issues go much deeper than an Amazon review. This music is new, fresh and different from those that come before it. Don't compare, just strap on some headphones, and walk in the front door. <br /> <br />PS - and it is way better than Fairport Convention, but then again so isn't pretty much everything.
B00005JNQA|3.0|From Smother Magazine smother.net:<br /><br />Staring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, \\"The Interpreter\\" is a high suspense drama that also shows American audiences how corrupt African nations are. With the genocide in Sudan, any film that brings attention to this is important. Lucky for us, the movie is really good too. With twists and turns, the movie follows a UN interpreter skillfully played by Nicole Kidman after she overhears two men talking about assassinating an African nation's corrupt leader (they used a fake country's name for some reason). Sean Penn is the US Secret Service agent that's assigned to not only watch and investigate her but also to prevent the assassination. The script was well-written and the acting was superb. Definitely check this one out.
031286504X|4.0|Matheson is a master craftsmen of the sci-fi and horror genre.  This novel is no exception and is my favorite thus far.  Only four stars though because the ending left something to be desired, at least for me.  Still good, but I've read a better ending in his shorter stories.  But definitely check it out - it's a great read.
B000AARKOO|3.0|From Smother Magazine smother.net:<br /><br />\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is yet another huge blockbuster from director Ridley Scott whose past work has included such big beasts as the \\"Alien\\" series, \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Blade Runner\\", and \\"Black Hawk Down\\". The movie is a tale about the crusades of the 12th Century and how one man must lead the armies to defend Jerusalem against invading Muslim armies. It certainly feels like it parallels current events to some degree with the Iraq war and it seminal Christian-based army versus the indigenous Islamic residents and insurgents. The movie is filmed brilliantly as one might expect but does tread on for a tad too long. The battle scenes are great and reminiscent of Scott's work on \\"Gladiator\\". The plot is occasionally thin with some commentary yawningly dull. Worthy of a rental or a Tivo but not much else.
B000BC8TBE|1.0|The undertones present in this album are in no way suitable for a good christian household. mariah promotes materialsm and glutony in this album, and our children must not hear it.  <br /> <br />Good Christians, stay away!!!!
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This band is amazing and they are great live. Most of these new emo bands are horrible live, that is why only amazing live bands make live records. I got this cd the other day and from beginning to end they make you feel like you are right there juming and screaming with them. It has been written that they are one of the top ten live bands in the world and I cannot argue a damn bit cuz it is true. Every song on here just seems so much heavier and passionate. The band really did a good job on the production of this record. If you like slipknot it would be horrible of you not to get this album so go get it right now. Changing my tune here for a minute, whoever is leaving reviews as a kid's review should be kicked off the site because he is an idiot and I wish I could give him the beating he deserves. With that said, buy this amazing live cd because you won't be disappointed. Long Live The Maggots!!!
B000BO0LLS|1.0|Upon reading that we can expect a new version of this album in late December, i felt a sudden convulsion in the pit of my stomach. What nerve does this woman have, releasing another version within a month of this version!!! I mean, at first I thought that this is rumoured December release was some sought of cruel joke, until i read it in my local 'Music buzz' magazine. Her record company is actually quoted as saying this in the article: 'We can't reveal any details yet, but what we can say is that Mariah is excited about giving her fans this special release for christmas, and that she is working hard on making it extra special for them'. <br /> <br />Let's hope that mariah realises that over-flooding a market with your cheap releases may actually have adverse affects on sales, and pulls the plug on this joke of a release. <br /> <br />Article quoted from the canadian Music Buzz magazine, November issue, under the headline 'Mimi plans diamond box for fans'
B000BOH8XW|4.0|After the release of \\"Fijacion oral vol 1\\", earlier this year, Shakira returns with \\"Oral fixation vol. 2\\", a new album, written in english, with a great collection of songs. \\"Don't bother\\", the first single, is a pop-rock song, with a catchy chorus, about a regular girl who is replaced by the perfect girl and looks for revenge. This CD also brings us great surprises, like \\"Dreams for plans\\", one of my favorite songs so far. Illegal is a song about the promisses men make to women and has the participation of Santana, with his classic guitar arrengements. I also like \\"Timor\\", which was a great surprise to me. Deep lyrics in a pop tune. \\"The day and the time\\" is the english version for \\"Dia especial\\", taken from \\"Fijacion oral vol 1\\" and it is as great as the original. \\"Hey you\\" and \\"animal city\\" are singles in potential and mix the latin rhytms with lousy guitars, a style always present in Shakira songs.           <br /> <br />Well, Shakira has taken a long road since the beginning of her career in Colombia.Even though Shakira has become one of the most popular singers in the world, she is still very down to earth, always concerned with the quality of her albums, which improve everytime she goes back to charts. Don't think twice and buy it!      <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BGR0OM|5.0|First of all let me say that no single CD could ever contain all of the best Eurythmics material. I think 3 discs minimum would be considered \\"ultimate\\". For die-hard fans like me, this set leaves a lot to be desired. For instance, there is nothing on this collection from \\"In The Garden\\", \\"1984 (For The Love Of Big Brother)\\", \\"Touch Dance\\", or \\"We Too Are One\\". Some bonus tracks would be good too. All of that aside, it is a wonderful CD, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a new Eurythmics fan. Every older track sounds better than ever remastered, and the two new songs are as good as it gets. \\"I've Got A Life\\" is classic Eurythmics lite-techno dance-meets lyrical drama, and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" sounds like something from one of Annie's excellent solo albums. The photos included in this collection are also superb! And Lyrics to all the songs! While it could be better, I do highly recommend \\"Ultimate Collection\\" to any Eurythmics fan...and if you're obsessed like me, you're gonna get it anyway!
B000BKDOCA|4.0|This remix album was released by BMG/SONY for one reason: Britney had a baby and did not record a new album in 2005. However, this album has great remixes for Britney hits, most of them taken from her last album. This album is not doing well on European charts because BMG/SONY is not promoting it properly and besides that \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\", by Madonna, is the focus of everybody's attention right now! <br /> <br />The unreleased song in this remix album is \\"And then we kiss\\", by Junkie XL, who brought Elvis back to charts with \\"A little less conversation\\". \\"And then we kiss\\" is a powerful dance song and it's a shame if it does not become as successfull as \\"Toxic\\".     <br />  <br />Even if you're not a fan of Britney, you should check this album. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AM6MKU|4.0|My husband rented this movie for our 3 yr. old daughter who is just starting to not be scared of Santa and loves trains.  She is a bit young to understand that \\"hero boy\\" is doubtful of Santa's existance, she loved the \\"Hot Chocolate\\" song, and seemed spellbound by the traveling ticket (ticket comes out of the train, follows wolves, gets eaten by a bird, and ends up back on the train).  Yes, this does have themes for older kids to understand but also has fun for little ones as well. She did not find this movie scary -  though portions of Pooh's Heffalump and Madagascar had her on edge. In fact, she has asked to watch this movie repeatedly so I  know we will be purchasing our own copy. <br />The reason for the 4, rather than 5 stars, has to do with the animation. Although overall the animation is excellent, the eyes of the characters seem a bit creepy to me - I am guessing this is a limitation of the technology rather than a flaw of the animators - regardless, they do seem somewhat souless. For that reason, I knock it down 1 star to 4 stars. <br />Other than that, I think the actors were very good - yes, you can tell Tom Hanks plays multiple characters but so what? I thought the story was compelling. And the music blended seemlessly with the storyline. This will be in our holiday movie rotation for years to come!
0375758992|3.0|A well delivered account of a British family that settles in colonized Rhodesia.  The author's account of her family's experience is well written, humorous at time and painful at others.  My initial resistance to the memoir was based on early impressions that this is yet another depiction of European oppression of native Africans during colonization.  However, as the book progresses life in war torn Rhodesia (and other countries) as revealed from the perspective of farming class colonizers proves to be more interesting than expected.  Fuller aptly captures the atmosphere of the African countryside - its sounds, smells and beauty.  It's always difficult to read of the disdain, disrespect and assumed superiority of one race over another but the author's life account demonstrates that a shift in racist notions is possible.  The book came to me by way of a friend who thought the book would be too \\"deep\\".  I didn't find that to be the case. I doubt that I would have picked this up on my own but I'm glad to have been exposed to the author's coming of age in the Motherland.
B00005Y7PS|5.0|Yet another Black Sabbath release that prove Tony Iommi to be the master of those sludgy, heavy riffs that are perfectly accompanied by Geoff Nicholls atmospheric keyboards.  As far as I know, this is Sabbath's first attempt at a concept based recording (Nordic mythology), and its result were interesting.  I hope Tony Iommi and his sidekicks try this again.    One of my all-time favorite songs is the Valhalla trilogy, which touches upon the aforementioned mythology theme.  Musically it is great - some interesting keyboard work (The Battle of Tyr), followed by acoustic accompaniment and Tony Martin's vocals (Odin's Court), and then BOOM! - Valhalla kicks of in all its heavy, speaker thumping glory.    Sabbath Stones - is yet another song that starts off a little slow before getting heavy and upbeat.  Underrated Sabbath gem.    Anno Mundi is another cool riff.  It sounds a lot like \\"Children of the Sea\\" from HEAVEN AND HELL, with its acoustic intro into the midtempo theme.  It's not as upbeat as Valhalla.  The fastest song on this release is Lawmaker.  Both of those songs are exellent riffs, and again I like the keyboards on Anno Mundi.    I also like Tony Martin's vocals for these songs.  Black Sabbath's sound is, to me, far more dependent upon its heavy, sludgy guitar riffs and atmospheric keyboard work than it is upon the voice, so don't let the absence of Ozzy or Dio prejudice you against getting this CD.  It is musically right up there with their best.    I personally was glad to see the departure from the occultish lyrics of their previous release and to see Tony Martin's interest in Nordic Mythology in the lyrics.    The song \\"Feels Good To Me\\" is a ballad for which a video was produced.  A good song, but it understandably might appear to be a little out of place for what one might anticipate from a Black Sabbath release.  Sabbath was not really a hair-metal band.  But it is nonetheless an interesting direction for the band.
B000060P79|5.0|I love this CD!!  It's fun and catchy, and the music is awesome!I'm confused with the people who claim to \\"hate SP with a passion\\" because you can either like them or not...but to hate them with a passion??  They must have gotten to you and stuck in your head! ;)  Catchy stuff!<br /><br />Anyhow, the vocals are great because they are unique and raw.  I love how it sounds honest and unsynthesized.  The music itself rocks!!  It's even more obvious how excellent of musicians they all are as individuals when you hear them live, but I still love this CD.  If you haven't heard Simple Plan, check out \\"Perfect\\" and \\"Addicted\\", they are really great.  I think \\"God Must Hate Me\\" is really funny and so is \\"I'm Just a Kid.\\"  The video to \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" is hilarious - you can see it on [...] under Videos.  I just discovered that recently and laughed my ass off at it.  You can see the band isn't taking themselves too seriously!  Anyhow, the CD rocks although I like their \\"Hard Rock Live\\" Cd even more!
B00065MDS6|4.0|I think the first few songs are right up there with Crimson's best.  An excellent mix of a sort of tinkly art jazz with great melodies and doom-laden mellotron.  Not much like the rest of King Crimson, but great stuff in its own right.  The last, unnecessarily long, song, though, just doesn't do much for me.  Pleasant, but lacking any great melodies or drama, it just kind of wanders along for a while...
B00063MBU8|5.0|This CD is one of our favorites...(only second to Simple Plan's Hard Rock Live CD.)  The bonus DVD footage is awesome!  All the songs are excellent.  We listen to this CD all the time and definitely recommend it!
0195145925|1.0|I have read many cosmology books despite I am not a trained scientist or the like .. I found this book extreme boring and very frustrating to read and understand , It jumped from A to B and back to A with diagram which are hard to understand . The author is trying hard to convince the reader on his believe but lacks the tool to do so in a \\"friendly manner\\" .  I laboured through this book and in the end I found myself learned nothing .In fact I am hesitated to even pass this book to my friend to read .
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I wouldn't have watched it all, ever, if the price hadn't become so low on amazon, that i decided it'd be cool to check it out.   It was by Josh and he didn't do too bad with buffy and angel.   Silly at times, but pretty cool at others. <br /> <br />So, here's my review: <br /> <br />It was a little tough to get into at first.  I think the first four to six episodes the cast was a little fresh and starting to discover their characters and roles.   The stoy itself is also a little fantastic.   The thing is, around the fourth or fifth episode, you stop noticing that so much.   I began to accept this as a fun fantasy.    <br /> <br />As the story continued, the crew seemed to gel more.  The story lines are pretty interesting, and really... it's a show about having fun watching it. <br /> <br />The fight scenes are a little silly, but i think that may have been by choice.   After all, this is a space cowboy movie... and the cowboy always stood there as bullets missed and he hit.   Well.. .actually they do end up hitting a bit.   I found it funny that when the captain was naked, there were no scars... <br /> <br />The universe of this story has it's laws, and the show does a good job of sticking to the laws of the world it's created. <br /> <br />It takes a few viewings to get into.   There's crew that needs to be met and introduced to you, and that takes a while.   But once that's done... it's a pretty damn cool show!   It doesn't take itself to serious, and it doesn't get too corny. <br /> <br />Oh yeah... and if Kaylee  (Jewel) ever reads this... i'd seriously like to propose marriage to her character in this show!   Damn she's awesome! <br /> <br />If you like sci fi... cowboy bebop... Josh's other works...  I think it's a safe bet that you'll end up loving this box set. <br /> <br />Oh... be forwarned though... there are a few scenes that were a bit graphic and disturbing.  The took place on the third disc mostly.  I think Josh had a bit TOO much fun on the specialeffects there. <br /> <br />Overall though... loved it.  I wasn't a fan, but I def am now. <br /> <br />Again... Kaylee... let's meet!  :)   I just loved those cute freckles on her nose and her whimsical smile... *le sigh*  :)
B000AA305M|1.0|I spend hours, like 12-15 at a time in airplanes. I love my Ipod. I love David Grey. I can't transfer songs to my Ipod from this disc. SONY needs to get a message. I will buy the bootleg version when I get to Asia in a couple of weeks for $1.50 . I never do this because I believe that stealing income from artists is so wrong. A special thanks to Amazon for the warning. <br />MJD
0307276902|5.0|James Frey's A Million Little Pieces is clearly deserving of the publicity that has surrounded it since publication and its widespread readership.     The story is set around Frey himself entering a residential treatment center for drug and alcohol addiction. At the time he is 23 years old and he has lived a life that could take others two or three lifetimes to experience. He has used and abused every substance known to alter mood. He has truly hit bottom and is scratching at the top of his own coffin when he arrives to treatment. On top of his desperate condition, he is an exceedingly angry and aggressive young man who makes it hard for people to like him.    Through the course of treatment, Frey, in his own very stubborn way, comes to accept his addiction and to understand that if he uses again, he will die. He is not an easy patient and he doesn't believe in following the recommendations of the staff. Yet, indeed Frey starts to resolve some past issues, to reunite with his family and to begin the road that might lead on to promise.    There are some extremely difficult moments in Million Little Pieces. In reading I felt uncomfortable at being so close to the pain and vulnerability of Frey and his parents. I had this same feeling in reading Augusten Burroughs \\"Running With Scissors\\". And, that perhaps it is the very rawness of their storytelling that makes Burroughs and Frey the notable contemporary writers they have become. They put it all out there and don't apologize for not making it seem pretty.    James Frey is an exceeding talented writer. His willingness to put himself on display as his subject -- an not a very attractive  one at that -- is a credit to him. I look forward to more of his work.    A pretty amazing story. Highly recommended.    Daniel J. Maloney  Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA
B00005ATQF|4.0|Here Stanley Kubrick gives a war film.One of the greatest directors here gives a very good film.But he could have done so much more in my opinion.One of the greatest directors to step on this Earth gives his view on the Vietnam war.    The film show's us the character of Joker who we see threw the training of marines in boot camp and how difficult it is and cruel it can be.We also see Private Pyle how he is constantly abused in the training and how tough a drill instructor could be.While drill instructors used be that cruel in the army.Now they cant lay a finger or verbaly abuse a private.We then follow Joker to Vietnam while he is a reporter and seeing in the process how dehumanizing the war is.And how death can change people.    In the film we get great performances from the whole cast.Matthew Modine in probably the biggest role he is ever gotten does very good job.Vincent D'Onofrio gives a tremendous performance as overweight and stupid Private Gomer Pyle.He even broke Robert De Niro's record of how much weight to gain for a film.He gained about 70 pounds,10 pounds more than De Niro.R.Lee Emrey gives Golden Globe Nominated performance for the mean and tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.He was actually a drill Sergeant before he became a actor.And later on his career has he played tough loud mouth characters.He also spoofed his character Hartmann in Peter Jackson's Frighteners as a ghost of the Sergeant .I think the reason that he is a great actor is the discipline he has from when he was in the army.    The problem the film has its that the last part of the film deals with a subject that has been done again and again quite a few times.On how you lose your humaninty.The thing is Kubrick could have thought some other way to end the film.He does everyhting great in the film.But he does something that has been covered in other Vietnam films like Platoon,Deer Hunter and others.But what he does in the film that is great,original and the best thing of the film is the wholeboot camp scenes.The realism of the training and the hardship that is with taken trough out it is marvelous thing to watch.Especially with Stanley Kubrick behind the camera.But that's the only thing to mind that is perfect in the film.The later scenes in Vietnam are good to to a extent.This is not one of those action Vietnam films.So I was expecting any of that.The weird thing is how the soldiers are being interview about their thoughts on the war felt not needed.It cut the flow of the film a bit.The sets of Full Metal Jacket is one of the problems of the film.Other Vietnam films like Deer Hunter,Platoon and Apocalypse Now were filmed in real locations being very similar to the ones in Vietnam.Instead Kubrick uses sets in England that make the atmosphere not as real as the jungles in Vietanm.Also the ending with the Mickey Mouse song I still don't get why they put that  in.    Sadly to say as with almost every Stanley Kubrick DVD this is a bare bones disc.No features at all.There are though exceptions like Dr. Strangelove,The Shining and Spartacus even though its not considered a Kubrick film.    This is good war film.Flawed but worthy.Im not big Kubrick fan like my best friends that are nuts.But I do admire his work especially Dr. Strangelove and The Shinnig.Those are perfect films in my eyes.Any loyal fan of Kubrick pick this up.This film is another nice view on how the Vietnam was,how the army training works and how wars change people.
B000BOH8XW|5.0|When Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1 came out back in June, I hadn't been so amped up about an album release in a great while. I've only been a fan since 2001's Laundry Service, but my Shakira collection has grown and I now own every album by her.<br /><br />So when Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 finally came out, I was even more excited than its former. I could understand the lyrics much better, and I would know what I was saying.<br /><br />As always, Shakira is never one to disappoint.<br /><br />The album begins with a chorus featuring Shakira and \\"How Do You Do\\" addresses many perplexing issues of religion and God in general. Charging into the kick-off single \\"Don't Bother\\", Shakira recalls the glory days of rock and new wave with screeching lyrics and ambiguous guitars. A single that will stand out amongst some of Shakira's most popular works.<br /><br />Carlos Santana makes an appearance on \\"Illegal\\", a song about toying with a woman's heart filled with synthesizers and heart-felt lyrics. The next song made its first appearance on Fijacion Oral, Vol. 1 and is very likely my favorite song from that album. \\"Dia Especial\\" has been transformed into \\"The Day and the Time\\", and sounds just as beautiful as it did on Vol. 1. The next on our menu today is \\"Animal City\\" a pretty genre-bumping song that has guitar licks a'la new wave mixed with mariachi horns and a dance beat that's not too un-rockish. Definetely a highlight of the album. \\"it's an animal city, it's a cannibal world, so be obedient, but argue some are ready to bite your head off\\". Greatness.<br /><br />\\"Dreams for Plans\\" is one of the tamest, most passionate songs featured on Vol. 2 of the Fixation. It's beautiful lyrically and musically. Featruing an almost lounge-like piano, and a synthetic drum beat, one of my favorite tunes background music-wise. She even makes references to her early english language attempts.<br /><br />\\"Hey You\\" starts of jazzily then turns into quite the ska-drenched track you'd least expect it to be, recalling \\"Poem to a Horse\\" from Laundry Service, but exceeding the ska-fused sound much better. And \\"Your Embrace\\" is another one of the most laid-back songs, featuring synthed-in drum beats that sound very familiar to those used on \\"Dreams For Plans\\". \\"Hope it isn't too late, to say 'I love you\\", one of the lyrical highlights in the song. And flowing into \\"Costume Makes the Clown\\" featuring references to \\"Wherever, Whenever\\" and guitar licks you'd expect from a Hair Metal group, very suitable when listening to the lyrics, though.<br /><br />And \\"Something\\" which also made an appearance on Vol. 1 as \\"En Tus Pupilas\\", it sounds much better transferred in english, and also sounds much better being placed towards the end of the album, where \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" began Fjiacion Oral.<br /><br />Album closer \\"Timor\\" is one of the most politically-charged songs I've ever heard Shakira sing. Who thought politics and euro-pop could be so fun combined? Only Shakira could do it.<br /><br />Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 doesn't surpass Vol. 1, but it is completely equal to its predecessor. Where Vol. 1 was more of a romantic picture of love, Vol. 2 is a caterwalling adventure through the woes of love and the throws of politics. I strongly recommend both, even for Shakira's non-fans.<br /><br />While Laundry Service reeled me in, the Oral Fixations have set the foundation.expect it to be, recalling \\"Poem to a Horse\\" from Laundry Service, but exceeding the ska-fused sound much better.

B000286RJI|4.0|I'm a big fan of the first movie, the second was different in style, still good, but for me, fell a little flat. The first movie was more artistic and so good at building up tension, and the second resolves everything, answers all the questions, reveals motivations and character. But maybe tying up loose ends is the way it's done in all the movies that Tarantino is parodying. Bill's reputation definitely preceeded and inflated him; he was even a bit boring - unusual for a Tarantino character. But this movie, like the first, is lots of fun amid murder and mayhem.
0307276902|5.0|This book took me away to another world that at times I wanted to run away from.  There is something in the way he writes that the words penetrate you, and you can feel his pain, addiction, and love.  He describes his battle for sobriety one hour at a time, and it can make you cringe, shake, cry, shout, and leave you searching for someone to hold.  There is a point where he describes these dreams he has frequently after detox, and I found myself having the same dreams after reading it.  When he fell in love with Lilly - I fell in love with Lilly.  And the others he met in rehab, well I consider them to be very good friends.  This is a fast read because it will consume your life untill the final page.  And I have never rushed out so quickly to buy the next book an authur writes.  I just hope James Frey is working on another one because I can't wait.
B00004R99I|4.0|Because of my interest in history, it's taken me this many years to force myself to watch this movie. I knew that Disney would twist this important historical event all out of shape, and they did. But after watching it I realized that it is good enough for children, and it might even inspire older children (and adults) to learn more about the real history. I also realized that it would be impossible to make a popular children's animated musical about Pocahontas and the complex interactions, motivations, and tragic outcomes between the English and the Native Americans without simplifying and distorting the story, and I forgive Disney for that. This movie does instill a sense of respect for Native Americans and awe for the glorious land that became America (for better or worse).
B000002LR3|5.0|Every track a gem.  <br />this album came out in 1991. Every track still rides.
B0000X81ZI|5.0|Kill Bill is stylistic art, to be appreciated subjectively. Expect to be entertained, but also expect to be piqued. It has no real plot, but the story works anyway. I hate gratuitous violence, I refuse to watch slasher movies, and I don't enjoy true crime or martial art films. It's difficult to explain the appeal of this uncompromising, irredeemable revenge film, but I can say that it touched some primitive, atavistic part of my emotions (humans have a degree of bloodlust built into their genes, necessary for the survival of our ancestors, which, ironically, may be the undoing of us now), without making me feel dirty or used when I left the theater. Tarantino also doesn't throw in the usual bunch of moralistic, hypocritical baggage that comes with other violent movies. There's no vigilanteism, no heroism, no phony honor system, no blind loyalties, and innocent people are left alone. Anyway, Kill Bill is as fun as murder and mayhem gets.
6305878323|5.0|In a word, mesmerizing.  This has to rank as the crowning achievement of Walt Disney's career, animated or otherwise.  \\"Mary Poppins\\" is an ingenious blend of clever visuals, song, dance, and animation.  This would all be for naught if the film were not anchored by the engaging lead performances of Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.  Andrews' warmth just envelopes the screen and when she sings you just melt.  Andrews may have won the Oscar but Van Dyke(not even nominated!) is more than her equal.  Van Dyke proves himself here to be be an agile song-and-dance man as well as a dexterous physical comedian.  We all knew that from watching him trip over the ottoman on his TV show.  You appreciate the skill of these actors when you consider that for alot of the film they are competing for screen time with visual effects and animated images.  Lastly, the song score by the Sherman brothers will reverberate in your head forever.
B000000H42|3.0|Whether or not you'll like Mercyful Fate depends largely on what you think of King Diamond as a vocalist.  He's one of the few people in metal music who is truly a Satanist (although his definition of a Satanist is probably very different from yours).  His singing style is unique to say the least.  King Diamond will sing one verse line in the highest falsetto you've ever heard (you'll think someone kicked him in the groin), and the next in a low, feral-sounding growl.  If you can get past his singing style and silly Satanic lyrics, then Mercyful Fate is definitely worth checking out.    King Diamond casts a long shadow over the band, but heart of Mercyful Fate lies with its two guitar players, Hank Sherman and Michael Denner.  These two rank right up there with the revered metal guitar tandems (i.e. Tipton & Downing of Judas Priest, Smith & Murray of Iron Maiden, etc).  Their playing styles are very different, yet they mesh together beautifully.  Sherman is more the shredder type, but his playing is never out of control.  Denner has a much more melodic playing style.  At times, he can make his guitar sound like it's crying.  Both took different aspects of Michael Shenker (Scorpions, UFO, MSG)'s playing style and made them their own.    Musically, DON'T BREAK THE OATH is a very good album.  There are plenty of great guitar riffs and the solos are amazing.  Structurally, the songs are well thought-out.  Kim Ruzz is an underrated drummer.  For me, the album's highlights are \\"A Dangerous Meeting\\", \\"Desecration Of Souls\\", \\"Gypsy\\", and \\"The Oath.\\"  The albums weaknesses are its vocals and lyrics.  King Diamond's high-pitched wailing on \\"Rebirth Of The Unborn\\" almost ruins the song.  My favorite song on the album is \\"Desecration Of Souls\\" because for the most part he sings in a relatively normal sounding voice.  Here's a sample of the lyrics from \\"The Oath\\": \\"By these names: Satan, Leviathan, Belial, Lucifer / I will kiss the goat.\\"  I found myself asking why Hank Shermanand Michael Denner couldn't find a less bizarre vocalist to work with.     I would definitely recommend listening to song-samples offered here.  Mercyful Fate may be a band that you'll enjoy listening to despite its flaws.  Either that or they'll be a band you absolutely hate.
6304696566|5.0|Forget for a moment that this is probably the greatest Western ever made.  Divorce it from the genre it ranks as one of cinema's greatest achievement.  Director John Ford advanced the genre with \\"Stagecoach\\" and the calvary trilogy but he raises the stakes even further here.  The title of the film has multiple meanings.  On the surface it refers to the 5 year trek to find young Debbie who was taken by the Comanche after the slaughter of her family.  It could also refer to John Wayne's character, Ethan Edwards, a man who served in the Confederacy during the Civil War who wandered for three years before returning to his family.  His search for young Debbie raises questions.  Does Debbie represent family to him or is she now part of the hated Comanche?  One of the chillier images I have from the film is Edwards nonchalantly shooting out the eyes of a dead Comanche.  The motivation for this is Edwards' knowledge that the Comanche believes he'll wander in the afterlife blindly without his eyes.  Wayne's performance of this complex character is subtle yet towering.  Jeffrey Hunter more than holds his own as Martin Pauley, Debbie's adopted brother who forms an uneasy alliance with Edwards to find her.  There's nothing showy about Hunter's work here but it's no less impressive than his young method actor contemporaries(Brando, Dean, etc.).  Great supporting cast on hand(Ward Bond, Vera Miles, etc.).  Vivid storytelling and Ford has never utilized his beloved Monument Valley to better effect.  When people say this essential viewing believe it.
B000BO0LLS|5.0|Ok this is a good album and i like the new songs especially Makin It Last All Night but d*mn.  <br /> <br />This rerelease is enough. Now they rereleasin it for xmas again? Wut is their problem? Mariah is forced to go along with it. I dont really think she'd do this to her fans purposely. Cuz b 4 this album she never did that. Def Jam just are desperate cuz they havent got any success from any of their artists lately. Ashanti flops, Ll Cool J flops, etc. <br /> <br />Mariah i'm a diehard fan. Stop doing this to your career. The company has made enough money of this album now.  <br /> <br />Next single i heard is spose to b So Lonely which makes no sense since one and only is part 1 y release only part 2?
B0007OY2P8|4.0|Northanger Abbey is always listed as Austen's \\"least\\" work so it's not too surprising so many people find this movie lacking.  It's not the best (or worst) adaptation of an Austen novel but it carries its own weight in a surprisingly short span and stays true to the novel.<br /><br />Katherine Schlesinger is hilarious as the clueless Miss Morland and I love Peter Firth in anything.  One can see his attraction to her naive but ethical ideas of how the world should be and she'd have to be deaf and blind not to be attracted to him.  Googie Withers makes an excellently mundane and dotty Mrs. Allen, forever pre-occupied with her dress and apparently incapable of much higher thoughts. The rest of the cast are good, especially the unbearably unctuous Cassie Stuart as Isabella Thorpe.  She's supposed to make one cringe... Her brother John is effectively noxious and repellent, General Tilney is wonderfully hubristic, mercurial and usually brusque, and the small part of the Marchioness, the General's society confidant, also stands out.<br /><br />I'd like to see a longer, possibly better adaptation of Northanger Abbey (and a re-make of Emma with Jeremy Northam but not Gwyneth...) but until one comes along this does quite well.  If you like the novel and allow some license I think you'll like this film.  Just watching Catherine discover the laundry lists makes it worth a viewing for me, though, so maybe I'm easily amused.
076783030X|3.0|I watched most of this movie yesterday.  I have a question.  I know we live in child-obessed times but did strike it anybody strange that when Hubbell is in Katie's hospital room after the birth of THEIR child he was so cavalier about it.  All he said was \\"she's so small.\\"  And the topper is that he acts like he is leaving her life forever.  No hint at all that he might pop in to visit his child once in awhile!!!!!!!! <br />Then,years later(I guess he did blow off his half jewish child)when Katie sees him and that iceberg on the street in NYC they never mention the child!!!!!!!! <br />Of course when I first saw this I was not a parent so none of this occurred to me.  Now that I have been one for almost 20 years it just hit a perplxed cord with me!!!!!!
B000B0QOJA|5.0|There are tidier documents of Coltrane's live gigs out there--several of these performances are cut short because the broadcast was limited to 45 minutes, and there are sonic imperfections on the first disc in particular--but I found this an utterly enthralling listen. You talk to people who saw Coltrane life & they talk about the amazing length & power of solos, the extended drum/sax duos between Coltrane & Elvin, the sheer spiritual & physical force of the music which could change your life. & I can't think of any other recording that really conveys all that to the listener as vividly as this one. There are more \\"outside\\" performance by Coltrane from later in his career but they rarely have the disturbing power of this one: I put this on the stereo & come out at the end feeling like I've been pinned to the wall for 45 minutes. This is also the point where Elvin & McCoy Tyner are playing are their most \\"outside\\" but also _with_ the music; on later recordings with Cotlrane as he got more into the avantgarde (away from fixed meters, modes, &c) they seeming to become more unwilling or skeptical participants. It's a disappointment, yes, that on two tracks (\\"My Favorite Things\\" & \\"Afro-Blue\\") Coltrane is cut-off in mid-solo by the end of the tape; but what I really like about this album is the feeling of the _band_, & Tyner is in especailly fine form throughout, so his two big spots on \\"MFT\\" & \\"Afro-Blue\\" are some of my favourite spots on the album. And just listen to the way Tyner & Elvin start pushing beyond barlines & any precise metrical feeling in the middle of \\"Song of Praise\\". <br /> <br />Other tapes of the Half Note sessions exist, in lo-fi sound; I haven't heard these, though they have circulated for years (\\"Creation\\" is considered the high-point among collectors). It's a pity that better-quality recordings of those other tracks haven't surfaced; but at least these two 45-minute sessions at last make available sonically better-quality versions of four of thesehistoric performances. \\"One Down, One Up\\" is one of the essential Coltrane performances.
B0000062GK|5.0|I had never listened to Joe, had no idea who he was until my boyfriend and I started going on long drives up to the mountains and he was constantly playing Joe's CDs.  This was the first CD to catch my attention, and I totally fell in love with it!<br /><br />\\"Up In The Sky,\\" \\"House Full Of Bullets\\" and \\"Crystal Planet\\" are great when you're snaking up a mountain road at about 55 mph. \\"Love Thing\\" is my absolute favorite track - actually, my favorite Joe song. Period.  It's very mellow and just beautiful!<br /><br />From \\"Trundrumbalind\\" on, you just can't go wrong.<br /><br />I wish that \\"Time\\" came a little sooner in the album (#14 of 15), another excellent track - it always gets you drumming your hands on the steering wheel.<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see him live twice last year, and you couldn't wipe the smile off of my face!  Joe is one of the best musicians around and you are sorely lacking if you don't have at least Crystal Planet in your music library!
B0000CCZ34|5.0|Released overseas in 2003, \\"PopArt\\" is a comprehensive retrospective of Pet Shop Boys' UK chart hits. Since 1985, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe have seen a whooping 35 of their singles hit the Top Twenty; 20 of them have cracked the Top Ten, and 4 have reached Number One. Over the years they have solidified a well-deserved reputation as one of Britain's most respected songwriters and music acts. The first disc, \\"Pop,\\" features the more straightforward perky hits like the Village People cover \\"Go West,\\" the tender ballad \\"Love Comes Quickly,\\" the discocentric \\"Heart,\\" and the love song \\"Miracles,\\" which was recorded exclusively for this album.  Disc 2 is \\"Art,\\" where the songs are more complicated in theme and may require some interpretation. While both discs are pitch-perfect in terms of quality, the \\"Art\\" disc is my personal favorite. This disc has another newly recorded track called \\"Flamboyant,\\" which is an on-point critique on the extravagant life of the celebrity. Other great tracks are \\"So Hard,\\" \\"Rent,\\" \\"Liberation,\\" and the autobiographical \\"Being Boring.\\"  As hits collections go, \\"PopArt\\" is a unique and timeless survey of one of the finest groups around. If you missed out on the duo's last collection, \\"Discography,\\" then you owe it to yourself and your record collection by picking this up. Like all great CDs, it will never leave your stereo.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is without doubt a collection of Pearl Jam's finest work. Classic rockers each and everyone of 'em. Tightly packed, excellently delivered. Vedder's (now) trademark vocal delivery, the screaming and slashing guitars, pulsating bass and thumping drums. <br /> <br />\\"Black\\" ranks up there on the list of power ballads along the lines of Metallica's \\"Fade To Black\\" and Dire Straits \\"You And Your Friend\\" - the feelings the song arouses in you are indescribable. <br /> <br />The album is pure magic. IMHO, the reason I feel Pearl Jam come off better than Nirvana, is that while Nirvana made great music, Pearl Jam - as another reviewer rightly pointed out - looks after the head as well as the heart. I don't understand the logic behind naming them \\"sell outs\\" - just because a band is successful doesn't automatically make them \\"mainstream\\". Just because you are radio friendly doesn't automatically make you a \\"sell out\\". Reasoning of this kind is snobbery - pure and simple. <br /> <br />I give this album a 5 stars - it's right up there with my 'Dark Side of the Moon' and The Doors debut album. <br /> <br />Get this one - you will fall in love with it like millions around the world have :-)
B0006L16N8|3.0|Im no nerd of music snobbery so I bought the new coldplay album, thinking that ROBTTH showed promise and this was their more mature thing. Musically it was cool what that one song does with that hypergreat kraftwerk song plus a pretty album cover plus (most embarassing) I needed to buy something.   I wish I hadnt dropped my cash into the Apple Martin estate. Martin sings one way all the time. It mostly sounds like a band trying to break into outerspace, probably to get far, far away from martin's voice and his words. The first track is epic and one of the best. It quotes Thus Spoke Zaruthustra, that stravinsky theme from 2001: A Space Odyssey. I can imagine kids going to see them live and it changing their lives. Just not mine, and if youre reading this far, probably not yours either.  The words are vague. Either he is too convinced he knows all about my (the listener's) pain, or he's speaking to himself for an hour; either way its boring. You, you, you. Me, me, me. I, I, I. Put into a mixed-metaphor soup. With diminishing returns. The performance doesnt save it, not with this vocalist. And that first song quotes a band they are said to be derivitave of: \\"Are they bleeding all your colours into one.\\" They could try harder.  I like the spare style of the musicians. I even like the keyboards. White Shadows  and Speed of Sound are pretty cool. Skip Fix You, x&y, swallowed in the sea, for sure, and a few more but I cant tell them apart.  OK Computer has the same dreamy sonic swell with more ideas and more notes. But being musically simple (like u2--a great band that can do wonders with one chord progression) does not mean its bad music even if (as I suspect) some Radiohead fans think so. Other bands have done it. And I dont care if a band sounds like other bands if they make it their own by writing good enough songs. They arent. They are barely writing songs. Its so slick and metallic-plasticky though and usually pretty-sounding. Samey pleasantness all the way through.All the surface of a classic album--big production, pseudoconceptual but great album art, serious b&w photos of the band--without the songs.  The bonus track sounds more real than anything else, like acoustic solo beck, and not so preachy/complainy as the rest, which dont really say anything even as pop songs. Any song lyric could be cut and pasted to any other song and it would be exactly the same. Ahhhh. The cd player just switched to Leadbelly...bad Leadbelly sounds good to me right now. What happened to rockandroll?
B000AADYRQ|4.0|With Plans, DCFC venture into more adult territory, offering up 11 new rock-pop gems. A lot of people are quick to say that after signing with Atlantic, the band's sound has changed to accommodate the more 'radio friendly' listeners. I have to disagree! All the quality, classic DCFC elements are still here. Yes, their sound is more polished, a lot less lo-fi, and lyrically more direct...but they've still managed to produce an excellent album.  When I first listened to it I was pretty lukewarm about it. It's one of those that really grows on you after you pay closer attention. It wasn't what I was expecting; however, after being more patient I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The songwriting is really delicate at times, almost to the point of being mushy, but it's endearing and not a put off like you'd think.  If your wary of investing in the 'new' DCFC at least check out \\"What Sarah Said\\", \\"Brothers on a hotel bed\\", \\"Crooked Teeth\\".<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this and say it's more than worth the 15 or however many dollars.  Really beautiful melodies, stand-out drumming and Ben Gibbard's signature lyrical styling make this one of the best releases of 2005.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|I saw the 1960 film version of \\"The Time Machine\\" in 1968, when it was shown on network television (I've seen it again since then). Just a few years later, I found a copy of the book and read it, enjoying it very much. First, lets get one thing out of the way. Neither movie version of \\"The Time Machine\\" has been absolutely faithful to the original novel written in 1895. Both departed from their literary source in ways which seemed appropriate for the times in which they were made. Having made that point, this, the 2002 version stands as a very good movie which can stand on its own merits, even if one has never read the novel.<br /><br />One feature I liked about this movie is that it does answer some questions which the book left unanswered (or even, unasked). The first of these is why the inventor is interested in time travel in the first place. It might be sufficient to give simple curiosity as a reason, but I believe the reason given in the film is more compelling. I do disagree with one point which the movie seems to imply, the premise that the past cannot be changed. Events happen the way they do not because of fate, but because people are either in the wrong place at the wrong time, or because they (or someone else) makes a decision one way instead of another. As one example, had the captain of the Titanic given orders to reduce speed at night, or adopted a slightly different course, the tragedy which befell his ship might well have been averted. In \\"The Time Machine\\", the inventor is driven to build the machine because he wants to change an event in his own recent past. He is then driven to journey into the distant future in hopes of discovering why he cannot change the past.<br /><br />This version does give affectionate nods both to the book and the 1960 version of the film. Writing in 1895, Wells describes the machine as having quartz rods, one of which was improperly made, and had to be made again. In this film version, we actually see numerous crystalline rods arranged in two rotating sections so as to form parts of a sphere. When energized, they create a field which forms a complete, spherical bubble around the machine, effectively \\"insulating\\" it from the time stream. The interesting thing here is that quartz crystals form the timekeeping element in the majority of watches and clocks sold today, although they were not invented until the 1960's. Was this just a lucky guess on H.G. Wells part?<br /><br />One of the actors from the 1960 version has a cameo role in this film, and one sequence, in which the machine is moving forward through time while the inventor watches fashions change in a dress shop across the street has been retained.<br /><br />Another question which the book does not answer is \\"Why did the time traveller never return after his last voyage\\" (he did make a brief return to have dinner with his friends, and tell them of his adventures). It is left up to the reader to imagine what could have happened. In this film, we are shown what happens, and it is a satisfactory resolution, given his reason for building the machine.<br /><br />Some of the themes of the book are explored a bit more deeply, such as the social rift between the laborers and the social elite, which was apparant even in Wells day. The film shows the result of these social classes actually becoming separate species through millenia of enforced separation.<br /><br />The movie does have some flaws, which have been noted by other reviewers. It is difficult to imagine any artifacts from the 20th century lasting 800,000 years, yet they have a few in the far distant future. I can imagine a piece of stainless steel, such as a knife lasting that long, but not easily can I see a computer so durable, yet there is one in the film. In spite of this, I did like the character played by Orlando Jones, the \\"ghost\\" in the computer, someone not in the book, nor anything Wells would have likely even thought of, yet an interesting and worthwhile addition.<br /><br />Admittedly, the Moon breaking up in the 21st century as a result of nuclear explosions is also inconsistent with what we know of impact crater physics, which are MUCH more powerful than current nuclear weapons.<br /><br />I do take exception with the \\"goofs\\" list on this films description, in which it is claimed that the bicycle-type wheels on the steam carriage are not correct for the time (1895-1900). The fact is, much of early automobile technology was borrowed directly from the bicycle industry, and the earliest Stanley, Locomobile, White and other steam cars, as well as the earliest Fords, Oldsmobiles, Haynes, (gasoline cars) ALL had bicycle type wheels, only adopting wooden wheels later. The car in the film appears to be a Locomobile (or a replica), and is correctly shown with bicycle type wheels. However, the soundtrack does have the wrong engine sound dubbed in, a sputtering gasoline engine noise audible as it is driven away. Rudyard Kipling owned a Locomobile, and described it as \\"noiseless\\". The hissing steam sounds and visible steam clouds do seem correct.<br /><br />However, these are small points to pick on. Taken as a whole, the film is enjoyable and exciting. I thought all the actors gave fine performances, and most of the special effects were excellent. I'm pleased to have added this to my permanent collection.on breaking up in the 21st century as a result of nuclear explosions is also inconsistent with what we know of impact crater physics, which are MUCH more powerful than current nuclear weapons.  <br />I do take exception with the \\"goofs\\" list on this films description, in which it is claimed that the bicycle-type wheels on the steam carriage are not correct for the time (1895-1900).

B000AP04FG|2.0|Any movie that relies on a single \\"punchline\\" or a \\"One trick pony\\" for a full 2 hours usually wears thin and this is no exception.<br /><br />By about 55 minutes my wife and I were saying to each other..... \\"OK, this has gotten old already\\".<br /><br />I have to admit though we liked Brad Pitt in this movie which was surprising since we have never thought much of anything he has done since Interview with a Vampire.<br /><br />He is one of those popular actord who you always wonder why he is such a press magnet since most of his films have been medicore.
B000B8QF00|3.0|Alanis decided to put together a Collection instead of a Greatest Hits compilation, but I find it unforgivable when all the singles which sold well are here and the ones which didn't, are not! In Brazil, her success continues to achieve high levels of radio execution unlike in the USA where she's almost a has been confined to the A/C format. Here, \\"Precious Illusions\\", \\"Joining You\\", \\"Flinch\\", \\"Offer\\", \\"All I Really Want\\", \\"So Pure\\", \\"Unsent\\", \\"King Of Pain\\", \\"Excuses\\", \\"Out Is Through\\" and \\"21 Things I want in a Lover\\" were all songs which went to our Top 40. These were the real singles, videos and songs that got airplay. She should have spared us of all the average, almost unknown, soundtrack material that appear in this collection and given us the real hits. Too bad, Alanis, you still owe us a true hits compilation!
B000AP04FG|4.0|Okay, so this is not an epic movie. It's not even a serious movie, but it is so much fun to watch!<br /><br />Mr. And Mrs. Smith live such very ho-hum lives. They are bored with each other to the point that they go to a marriage counselor. That's where the movie opens. Our characters are uptight and find each other intensely boring. At home they are polite to each other and live a quiet life in a beautiful home. Can this marriage be saved. You bet it can.<br /><br />Though they masquerade as a computer engineer and an architect, they are so much more. Their offices are fronts for their real activities - they each belong to a clandestine organization that neither one knows about. The marriage is just a front, but both are unaware of the other's activities. I won't say more about the plot, wouldn't want to ruin it for anyone.<br /><br />The movie takes off from quiet and boring to intense and loaded with espionage and shootouts that are amazingly well done, making it easier for you to suspend belief. Sprinkled in are some truly hilarious scenes with supporting characters that will leave you laughing out loud.<br /><br />This movie was a lot of fun. I highly recommend it.
